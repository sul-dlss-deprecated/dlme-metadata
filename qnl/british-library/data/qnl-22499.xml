Dear Colonel Loclai, Would you be so kind as to give me an appointment for half an hour today or. tomorrow morning ■y on a matter of businesw . Any time will be convenient for me. Yours Sincerely H.B .M's Political Agent BAHREINOn the morning of the 4th July 1933 Mr.Ghisholm came to see me lay appointment. He said that he proposed,if there was not objection,to go to see the Shaikh and afterwards Mr. Belgrave to say that with reference to the letter which Mr. Sampson had sent &gt; hiB Company were interested but could not give a definite decision as to whether they would like to compete for the remaining area in Bahrain,until after a Company meeting and they would prefer to defer any further representation for a month. / 2. Mr.Chisholm asked whether he should confirm this in writing to the Shaikh and Myself. I said that on the whole it was better to confine himself to a verbal a^iwcrsati on. I £ understand that he is going to confirm the conversation of this morning in writing to me. He enquired whether he should inform Mr.BeIgrave/and I said that it was^ desirable that he should do so. I explained that he should not write to the Shaikh as any communication of that sort should come through me. 3. I took some pains to make clear the position of the Political Agent in the matter of the Oil,that is to say,that the Shaikh had come to us for advice over the matter of oil and that it was not a question of the British representative and a British firm in collaboration doing all they could to push a British interest as against an American firm and an American representative,but that in the peculiar circumstances in Bahrain the Political Agent was in a position of holding the ring, 4. Mr,Chisholm asked what the area of Bahrain was and I said that it was not quite accurately known,but probably in the vicinity of 150,000 acres. He asked if this included shallow waters and I said that he was there trespassing on difficult questions, 5. Mr.Chisholm told me that Mr.Sampson and Haji Williamson havk left. Mr.Sampson going to Basrah where they are to have a meeting in connection with C^atar on his (Mr.Chisholm's) return 6. Mr.Ghisholm mentioned the matter of credentials and I said&amp; s that I thought that if he came down here again with the intention of negotiating,he should have some form of credentials. He offered to produce a letter containing a credential,though it was not intended for me,but I said that on this occasion there was no need for it. 4-7-1933gonfidmtial BAHREIN 4th.July 1933 dated 21st. ultimo,and in confimation of our conversation this morning , we have the honour to inform you that the question of our negotiating an agreement with H.E, the Shaikh of Bahrein for the exploitation of any of his territories unallocated to other parties is now under review by our London principals. Pending their decision we are taking no further action in this matter, tout will cominicate with you again within one month. We have the honour to toe Sir Your otoedient Servants For Anglo-Persian Oil Go. Ltd.On the 5th July 1933 I went into the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited to ask Mr.Russell about the arrival of the ship with Captain Gastrell. Mr.Russell' took the opportunity to ask me the position as regards the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. He said that they had been disturbed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company people / to Bahrain and Mr.Russell asked me whether anything could be done,saying that Major Holmes had asked him to let him know if anything was required dealing with. Mr.Russell showed me a letter to the Political Agent in which Major Holmes had asked my Predecessor to address any letters for him care of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited and that Mr.Russell would deifcl with any local matters. I had seen the letter before and I explained that in petty matters one would naturally use commonsense in dealing with him and Mr.Skinner but in political matters the only between the Company,the Government and the Shaikh was the Chief Local Repre8entative,Major Holmes,a,nd I «Uiruijui that he imiiiil any power to delegate any part of his position to anyone else. Mr .Russell asked whether I thought he should wire to Major Holmes to come out and I said that the position, so far as it concerned Government, was that the only person ite. whom theyycould deal was Major Holmes and it was for the Company to decide v/hitheiy they wished to have dealings with the Government and the Shaikh or not. 5-7-1933.Bahrein 6th.

I With reference to Renders letter to you ©f June 7th on the subject of Major Holmes 1 reaidence In Bahrein and his obligations under the Agreement of 12th June, 1930, I have been considering the nmtter further and it seems to me that it is worth exploring the question of whether Holmes could not be removed or his activities I-^circumscribed, as suggested in Hendel's letter. I note from yourletter of May 20th that the Colonial Office surest that the matter be allowed to rest until the other questions, i.e., extension of the prospecting licence and amendment of the mining lease, have been gat out of the way, but this might take a considerable time and I am very doubtful as to the wisdom of waiting until all these things have been cleared up. ' ; ould it not be possible when these points are being discussed with Pallantyne to take the opportunity of raising f olmes* position on the ground that the existing agreement is not being complied with. Judging by past correspondence it appears that the Company do not altogether approve of him, and if we give them a hint that , .Government were not satisfied with his recent activities they might be prepared to terminate his services. Failing that, we might take the line that we propose to insist on the agreement being observed which would involve his K. .Blaxter Esq., Colonial Office, Downinr St., ' :i • • ^ • remaining/rdTnftlftin{£ in Baltpom for full psriod o- proscribed in the agreement. As the Company' increase there should be more for him to do been the case in the past. If as a result of such action Holmes resigned his appointment, it would be all to the @000 and I am inclined to think that once he gave up Bahrein his prestige would be very much lessened in other countries in the Persian Gulf and Arabia. I am sending copies of this .nd loore Yours sincerely, (Sd.)F.C,Starli 1 1 1 • .1 .

In your letter dated the 17th May it is stated, inter a lia * that His Excellency the Shailch of Bahrain 'requested' you to call at Sakhir to discuss with him the contents of your letter dated the 4th April 1933. It is also stated that His Excellency the Shaikh 'agreed' to the proposals contained in your letter dated the 17th May, and you further refer to the proposals as the 'offer' of His Excellency the Shailch. 3. A copy of your letter of the 17th May was communicated to His Excellency Shailch Hamad bin 'Isa al Khalifah, who denies that it correctly represents the position. In the first place His Excellency the Shaikh states that he did not re Quest you to visit him, out that you did so of your accord. His Excellency denies that he made any 'offer' or that he 'agreed' to any proposals. 4. His Excellency further states ■ V emphatically that two most important points - that is to say (a) the inclusion of Territorial Waters and (h) the proviso that the loan mentioned in the second paragraph/paragraph of your letter should be dependent on the world market for oil were not mentioned to him, and that the conversation related to the additional area of .Bahrain island only#uhirci ly.

Resident's telegrams Nos:625 and 6S6 (S.N ob : 54 and 55)) arrived at 16.00 hours on the 2nd August 1933 and were decypiiered by 17,00 hours. 2. At 17.50 hours I saw Mr.Belgrave and conveyed to him the instructions in the first part of S .No:55 and explained to him the necessity for their 'being no further discussions oral or otherwise,with Major Holmes ©n oil questions. He agreed to this and accompanied me to SAKHIR where the Sha,ikh was staying. 3. The Shaikh received us at about 19.30 hours and the situation was explained to him. He fully agreed that it was essential that he and his brothers and sons should refrain from any discussions with Major Holmes direct and ail communications should come through the Agency. 4. In connection with this channel for communications from Major Holaes I showed the Ruler Condition 'C of the Schedule of the 12th June 1930. He expressed ignorance of the contents of the Schedule and asked that Mr.Belgrave should supply him with a copy of it for his information, at the same time he agreed with its contents. 5. The Shaikh informed me that he had received a message through Yusuf Kanoo that a communication was on its way from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He asked whether the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would have to use the same channel as the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I replied that 1 was also expecting a communication from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and that there would probably be instructions from Bushire on this matter but that the mail had not been opened as yet. I added that Mr.Chisholm was fully aware that all communications tiiat ooirimmu oati one had to come through the P.R and the Agency and that 1 felt sure that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would abide by these rules.6. It was also explained to the Shaikh that Major Holmes had left England before the Shaikh's intention to accept offers from other interested parties had heen communicated to London and that on Major Holmes arrival and enquiry from me,i will inform him of the situation. 7. I impressed on the Shaikh that His Majesty's Government did not wish to rush matters,'but that it was essential that there should toe no inaccuracies in this interpretation in ti■ e future and for that reason it was essential that the Political Agent should toe present at important Meetings,and for that reason they had suggested that a month should toe allowed for interested parties to sutomit proposals, 8. The Shaikh,who was toy this time getting hungry, expressed his willingness to receive me at any time during the following few days should the matter necessitate my going out to his hunting camp. 3-8-1933.

On Friday, the 4th .august 1933,at 10,30 houra I saw Mr.Belgrave and asked whether the Shaikh had received any letter trom the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (vide Para 5 of S.No:61). , No coinmunication had come in from SHKHIR by the Shaikh's Man much to Mr.Belgrave's astonishment. I therefore surmised that from the contents of S.No:63(A) no letter had arrived for the Shaikh,who however had been expecting an offer of a la,rge cash payment. 2. I showed Mir.Belgrave the Anglo Persian Oil Company's lettei of 1st August 1933 (S.No:63(A)) addressed to the Political Resident in which they intimated their interest in the •'remaining I territory - if any. 3. We discussed the situation which we understood to be:- (a) the Bahrain Government must decide whether they are going to grant a year's extension under Clause IV of the Concession. (See Para 1 of Major Holmes letter of 4th April 1933 at P.81). i I (to) The Bahrain Government await a ruling as to whether ' they are bound by any 'right' to grant this extension. ( see (1) Para 3. P.87. (2) Bahrain Goveriiment letter at P.95 et seq. (3Para 4 - S. No : 3 6) . !! (c) if the ruling is to the effect that Shaikh has the option and is under no obligation to extend then he can either:- (i) extend Prospecting License over 100,000 acres by One year. (ii) refuse to extend. If (^),then the Bahrain Petroleum Company contimie their exploration of Island and payment of Rs.20,000(?) p.a. If • pi) t then by 2nd December 1933 the Bahrain Petroleum Comoany must choose their 100,000 acres in not more than three olots. There will then be the 'remaining area' of some 38,000(?) acres available for 'interested parties',i.eBahrain Petrol Company and Anglo Persian Oil Company (for 'Iraq Petroleum Company) to consider. ,eum4, If all tills is correct then it is going to 'be hard to get the Ruler to understand it. He wants 'benefit now and lota of it. It appears to go in circles and there appears to 'be nothing to 'compare' till after 2-12-1933. 9 5-8-1933?C's. P. P.—L (in) 980—300-12-29—c.

He realized that no good would come of his arguing these points with the Shaikh, 4, He had just received a telegram from London indicating with and through the Agency, He agreed that this was excellent for the Company, He expressed a desire to pay a purely courtesy call on the Shaikh etcetera and I informed him that was in order. 6, Major Holmes told me of his dislike for American oil business methods and how he had been let down by Mr.Lombardi s over the recent Hasa Concession, 7, He asked whether I could or would tell him whether His Majesty's Government intended to get a British Oil Company into Bahrain, 8, I replied that I couldn't tell him anything,but I pointed out itads His Majesty 's Government 's attitude of neutrality at Kuwait. This I felt was no admission. 9, Major Holmes on leaving asked if he should put in his Company's offer, I replied that I was expecting further instructions on this matter. He said no more and left, 10, The meeting was friendly and Major Holmes (on purpose or doubt) took pains to remove 'suspicion' from my mind. 11, His attack will no doubt develop! 12, Before leaving he presented me with a copy of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's report of progress which might be of Interest, A copy for was also presented. that the Shaikh was open to offers from interested parties and that he should do nothing outside the Agreement. 5, I informed him that on all oil matters he must work 6-8-1933C's.

This was considered essential not only to ensure hsrmonious relations between the company exploiting the concession and the Bahrein! population and the local authorities, but also because the special treaty relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh ol Bahrein render it highly desirable that the Company's Chiei Local Representative should be a British subject and persona grata to His Majesty's Goveranenu. , was explained at the tjine uo representatives of the erican interestb, to whom the concession was being assigned, and who were anxious to appo int/ appoint a United States citizen as the chiei Local Pepresentative. a compromise was eventually reached whereby although Condition c did not state in terms that the company's Chief Local Representative should he a a British subject, Major Holmes, who is British subject, should be appointed to the post for the first five years. 4. Unfortunately, the arrangement has not turned out satisfactorily from the point of view of His Majesty' s Government. Major Holmes has frequently end for long periods absented himself from Bahrein, and has on one occasion at least failed to comply with the provision that ne should communicate ith the Sheikh only through the Political Agent at Bahrein ret he has taken advantage of his absences rom Bahrein to engage in other activities, unconnected with his dutiesIn Bahrein, which have been the cause oi considerable embarrassment to His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gun end elsewhere. a note is attached to this letter setting out in more detail the grounds ol' complaint against Major Holmes. 5. In these cir cm stances, His Majesty's Government have, for some time, had under consideration the possibility of taking steps either to compel Major Holmes to confine himself to carrying out his duties in Bahrein within the terms of Condition C, or to securing his replacement by some other more satisfactory individual. To this end, it has been necessary for His Majesty 's Government to examine their precise position under condition C. / The view taken is that the wording of the Condition is only open to the natural constructionconstruction that the Company's Chief Local Representative should spend his whole tlrne in Bahrein (with a reasonable period of annual leave for purposes of health, which should he spent in a better climate than that of the Gulf). He should in any case, be at hand when business has to be transacted with the local authorities, or negotiations conducted with the Sheikh of Bahrein, whether such business or negotiations are Initiated by the concessionaires or by the other party. It may also be held to be implicit in the Condition that the chief Local Hepresentative, who is to be persona grata to His Majesty 's Government, should to some extent hold a watching brief for His M a J e st y' s Gove r rme nt, or at lea st constitute himself a safeguard against things being done by the Company at Bahrein which His Majesty's Go-vemnent wouldV --■^ein petroleum ®y, 8th August, ' / / [Bahrein petroleum F/. 3rd.

In August, 1932, the question ol' aajor Holme's absences from Bahrein was trken up with the Company, when they were asked whether they would give an assurance that Major Holmes would reside in Bahrein for a minimim period o£ nine months each year. After oral discussions with the company's representa- (rofi z) ■ tive in London, a reply was received to the effect that the chief Local Eepresentative had been in Bahrein at o Cu 11 times required by the Company for communications with the Sheikh and the local authorities, and expressing the view that, while condition C decides the medium of approach, i^ leaves to ^ne Company 'as necessarily it must', the decision when and for what purposes the • ' I am 1 ii 1 % 0 ompany should approach the local m. authorities. A copy of the correspondence with the Company is enclosed withwiuh. this letter, a corollary to the Company's interpretation of Condition c, which has been conl'imied in oral discussions with the Company's representative in London, is that no violation of the Condition would have taken place if at any time the local authorities, or the Sheikh, desired to transact business with the Chief Local Representative end the latter was absent from Bahrein. 7. Before pursuing the matter further with the company, it is desired to clarify the legal position under Condition C, and I an accordingly to request that you will be good enough to furnish the secretary of State with your advice on the following poxnxs. (a) The correct interpretation of the phrase 'at all times maintain in Bahrein'; i.e. does this mean that the Chief Local Representative should spend his re - i imirn his whole time in Bahrein, with a reasonaole period for leave, or that he need only he in Bahrein when required to transact business or conduct negotiations? (h) 11 the latter interpretation is correct, does this mean that he need only 'be in Bahrein to transact business or conduct negotiations when required by the Com-Qun:/ ? (c) ■ Whether it is Implicit in the wording oi Condition C that the Chief Local Representative, who is supposed to be persona grata to His Majesty's Government, should to some extent hold a watching brief for His Majesty's Government, or at least be a safeguard &amp;P gainst things being done by the Company at Bahre in whi ch His M aj e sty's Government would not approve (d) Whether in view of the wording of the condition.

Grounds of complaint against Ma.ior Holmp.a 1» iroin August 19o0 to August 1932 Major Holmes was resident in Bahrein for periods which amounted in all to ahout six months. bince that time he has heen absent on numerous occasions on matters unconnected with his duties as the Company's Chief Local Representative in Bahrein. , I if ^ P € '' 2m In April 1933 Major Holmes submitted an application hy the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an extension of the Company's prospecting licence in return for increased payments and stated that the Company could not hold their financial offer open for more than 30 days from a certain date. After submitting his proposals Major Holmes left Bahrein for Egypt and Jedda. The British Political Agent had thus no one in Bahrein with whom to communicate on any points for discussion which might arise from the proposals# Such points did arise and the ShejHti of Bahrein expressed surprise at 'the absence of Major Holmes from Bahrein during a discussion ol such importance'® 3c In May 1933 Major Holmes returned to Bahrein and after interviewing the Shaikh^produced certain further proposals which he communicated to the British Political Agent. He then again left Bahrein. Both the circumstances surrounding the submission of the latter proposals and the terms of the proposals themselves called for discussion with Major Holmes, but he was still absent from Bahrein at the end of June, has, however, now been received that the Bah Petroleum Company have recalled him to Bahre^ nn wl t h 'S heikh . The personal interview with the Sheikh of Bahrein referred to in the preceding paragraph was in direct contravention of the stipulation contained in Condition G that all communications with the Sheikh must era! duct in ■sin and ywhere' be through the British Political Agent* 5» Since his appctitment under the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Major Holmes' general conduct both in Bahrein and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf has been unsatisiactoryi rom the point of view of His Majesty's Government. 6» With regard to Bahrein, it is clear that he has - ms-dQ serious mis—statements regarding his interview with - PIV(jl) the Sheikh in May by misrepresenting the Sheikh as having agreed to some of his proposals and by asserting that certain aspects of the matter were discussed which in fact were not mentioned at the interview* 7« He had used his frequent and prolonged absences from Bahrein to mix himself up in several matters connected with oil in the Persian Gulf outside the scope of his duties as Chief Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The chief of these extraneous activities has been Ma protracted negotations with the Sheikh of Kuwait on b ehalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate and the American interests behind the Syndicate for an oil concession in Kuwait, during which time he has been far from open in his dealings either with the Sheikh or with the local British authorities in the Gulf. He has also taken a hand in various efforts on the part of American interests to obtain oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area and in Nejd. In short, it is probably not too much to say that the present unsatisfactory position of the various oil questions in the Persian Gulf (Including Bahrein) Is largely due to Major Holmes' activities in the past three years#S fsj f&lt;f liTDIA OFFICE, WHI?SHALL, S.W.I.

His Excellency admits that the Company has not failed in carrying out drilling operations continuously over a period far exceeding the three months mentioned in Article IV of the Bahrain Oil Concession. Owing to the financial position of the State however His Excellency is averse from granting to the Company an extension of the Prospecting License until December 2, 1934 because he considers that such 7 an ' tan extension would tend ' the Government of Bahrai] from the oil concession, the view held by the Comi to this extension but he point by the interpretatj by the legal experts in i has been referred. 3.

He does not agree with the view held by the Company that it has a 'right' to this extension but he will be guided on this point by the interpretation of the clause in question v the legal experts in England to whom the matter has been referred. 3. He regrets that the previous offers for the additional area are now definitely withdrawn. I ' His Excellency has particularly instructed me to inform you that until quite recently he has suffered from a grave mis-apprehension regarding the additional area. Although the concession is for 100,000 acres, which corresponds to 100,0001k feddans, His Excellency has always assumed that the concession covered half of the total area of Bahrain, apart from the fore- ^ shore and territorial waters.

Neither acres or feddans are familiar to His Excellency as a land measure and he has always assumed that the area described in the concession as 100,000 acres represented only half the island. Further His Excellency believes that in the first agreement between His Excellency Shaikh Sir Isa bin All alXhalifah, and the Eastern and General Syndicate, which was not approved, the concession was for half of Bahrain. No copy of this first agreement appears to be in existence. His Excellency StL ft,Excellency feels that while references were being freely made to the other ^half' of the island during the lengthy negoliations on the subject he should have been informed that this 'half was in reality an area very considerably less than half the total area of Bahrain.

Shaikh Abdullah said that what they would like to do was to extend the prospecting license by a year only if the Company would pay up something substantial for that privilege. Either in cash or in advance of future profits ^ Pqi ((eftU) (see Para 6 of Shaikh's letter of 20-4-1933 ). It '..as explained that th.is point had not been lost sight of by His Majesty's Government and that the decision when it came would undoubtedly cover this.
