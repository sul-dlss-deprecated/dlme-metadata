Political Agency, Kuwait, May 22nd, 1941. To*- His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmad Al-Jabir As Sabah, K.C.S.I., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait. After Compliments. I have the honour to inform Your Highness that I have received a letter from the Hon’ble the Political Resident No.299-5 dated the 14th. May 1941, in which he asks me to convey the thanks and appreciation of His Majesty's Government to Your Highness, at your willing decision to forego the wireless set which was to have been obtained for Your Highness by the Directors of the Kuwait Oil Company as Your Highness's contribution to the general war effort. His Majesty's Government notes also with special satisfaction Your Highness's communication to the Political Agent, that if Your Highness can help in any other way in the war effort you will be pleased to do so. Usual Ending. Sd.'H. R* P* Dickson, Lieut Col., Political Agent Kuwait.'&gt;1 . ) ^ F I CONFIDENTIAL. D.O.No.C/327 Political Agency, (3J Kuwait. Dated tiie 25th May, 1946. IK, Please refer to the correspondence resting with your Confidential printed letter No.299-3 dated the 14th May, 194x. His Highness brought the matter up in conversation on the 12th May saying that he had signified his willingness to do without the /-\ S et as a contribution to the war effort and, now that the war was over, ^ would appreciate it if the matter was proceeded with. He appeared to be under the impression that the set was actually in existence in the United Kingdom and had been taken over by His Majesty’s Government for the duration. I told His Highness that I would look the matter up, but shall not refer to it again until he does so. 2. I Imagine that the oil company originally contemplated the gift as part of their policy of keeping His Highness 'sweet' by f periodic presents so that he should acquiesce in the postponement oi the production of oil (and payment of royalties) until after the v/ar. Now that oil will shortly be produced and that they are presenting a fine motor launch to the Shaikh it seems improbable that they will be anxious to make this present. Apart from this they are installing various sets for their own purposes and would not, I believe, welcome i the interference which might result from the operation of His Highness’ ^ set. 3. -I think His Highness is likely to bring the matter up again and, if he is told that the Kuwait Oil Company will not make him a present of a set^his probable reaction will be to ask if the eastern Gulf Oil Company will give him one. If this request were refused there is nothing to preVent His Highness buying and installing a set privatel; and I think we should be prepared for this development. The Hon’bleLt-Col. W.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE.X 2 4, Should he install a powerful set it appears possible that it would lead to unwelcome complications and it seems to me that the best solution would be to remove the necessity for any such set by the installation by Messrs Cable and Wireless Limited of radio - telephone communication with Riyadh* As you know the Arab community is pressing for telephone communication with Basra and the Oil Company are complaining about delays in communication with Abadan, and a radio - telephony installation seems the ideal solution if the permission and co-operation of Iraq and Persia could be secured. By providing communication with Saudi Arabia we should kill a third bird with the same stone. 5. I believe two-way short range radio sets are used by the army and the presentation of one of these to His Highness might be sufficient to satisfy, at least for a time, his eagerness for a private wireless. Provided it had a range of 200 miles, he could use it for communication with Kuwait when on his prolonged hunting trips in the desert. 6. I should be grateful for instructions as to what attitude I should take if His Highness brings the matter up again. Yours sincerely, M.BV Ct.T.C. Political Resident, at Bahrain.

The Shaikh of Kuwait has returned to the charge and requested that now that the war U over the question of obtaining a wireless transmitting set for him may be proceeded with. The Politloal Agent reports that when the Shaikh broached the matter he appeared to be under the impression that the set with which the Kuwait Oil Company propose to present him was actually in existence and had been taken over by Hie Majesty's Government for the duration of the war. . - 3. The Kuwait Oil Company are presenting Hie highness with a fine launch and there is certainly no necessity for them to give him a wireless set in addition. It is posaiole however that if the Shaikh is told that the Kuwait Oil Company are not willing to give him a set he will turn to the La stern Gulf Oil Company. There would in any case appear to be nothing to prevent His Highness buying and installing a set privately and were tnia to happen he might well interfere with the Cable and Wireless and all Oil Companiei installations. 4. in the circumstances X would suggest that the possibility of a set being presented to him by His Majesty's GoverniLent should be considered. Presumably there are now a number of sets surplus to the requirements of the defence services. It would perhaps be possible to choose a set xka which would not be likely to interfere with existing installations in Kuwait or otherwise make a nuisance of itself. The immediate purposes for which the dhaikh requires the set are stated in the enclosure to Pe4l f s demi-official letter Bo. ¥•£» 6357/1940 dated the 27th November 1940. I think he really wants it as/ a toy* but It would of course be necessary to give him something f r b0 watt set which he already possesses. 5.

He also confirmed that there are a large number of transmitter sets now surplus to the require ments of the defence Services. He offered to pursue * the matter further with his Company (Cable and Wireless) when he returned home but I said I had taken the matter up with the India Office and that I preferred to leave it to them to take any further action that Major M.P.0’C.Tandy, Political Agent, Kuw; at Karachi might be necessary RHL &lt;7^\ Telegram rom Q.( Repgu, Bahrain.

At the same time we could i think arrange for hia to purchase a set and we understand that the Britisn Military &amp;0.33 would suit his requirements. If so we could probably arrange a supply from the aovemasnt of India allocation. The cost price of this set (tropic proof&gt; is £1,150 to which there would have to be added the cost of departmental inspection, freight and installation charges, plus the cost of the requisite spares.

Sheik of Koweit Sir, I am to refer to your letter Est 5 O 96/46 dated 9th August, 1946, addressed to Group Captain H.G. Leonard-7til 1 iams which referred to the provision of a Wireless Set No.53 for H.H. The Sheik of Koweit. I am to inform you that the ‘fireless Set No.53 falls short of the specification submitted by the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, in the following details:- (a) The frequency band is 1.2 mo/s to 17.5 me/s. It will not therefore be possible to operate at 17»6 mo/s or to have the upper limit of frequency 17.75 me/s. (b) To retune to another frequency will involve more than flicking switches and tuning of aerial stage. It will be necessary to adjust the drive tuning and P.A. tuning in addition to aerial coupling and loading. This operation, although not as quick as 'flicking switches' wo Id not be over-lengthy. System A.1 and A.3 are possible. The Receiver normally supplied with the Wireless Set No,53 is the R.107 and its frequency band is 1.2 mc/s to 17.5 mc/s. The/ The Under Secretary of State for India, Army Equipment Branch, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.1,/*\ The receiver called for in the specification is required to have a frequency coverage of *540 iuo/s to 6# 2 me/s. The power output of the ireless Set No.53 at the highest frequency (17*5 rac/s) will probably be less than 250 watts. The generator supplied with this Wireless Set is the 'Generating Set, 3.5 KVA, 230V 50 cycles.' I anl further to add that there is no objection to the issue of this set either from Indian stocks or our stocks and that if the Indian Government are prepared to supply it free of charge, there is also no objection, provided the cost is borne by India. Should it be provided from H.M.G. or Jointly owned stocks in India, we should be given an appropriate credit under the Defence Expenditure Plan. Alternatively, should provision be effected from War Office stocks a repayment requisition will be required. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) H. Dean Major. for Director of Amy Requirements.

The suggestion that the channel for frequency demands should be via the Persian Gulf Manager of Mes rs. Cables and Wireless and thence through Head Office in London was made as being a practical method of frequency clearance, and in addition suggested a method whereby a speedy termination of this affair could be foreseen. I have since had words with Horrox of the G.P.O., who stated that he was not too happy about this suggested method of channelling as it might introduce political repercussions. I agree with Horrox, and new suggest that any application from the ‘■’heikh should first go to the Political Agent at Koweit. If the latter then passes the application on to the Persian Gulf Manager, I think that any question of abnormal procedure, which the Sheikh may raise over appl: ing to essrs. Jables Sc tireless direct, will be answered. F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office. tO # ^ ^ a+’/l tffc T?ci n flMlT'O ^ Am 31A AGQ Tifl/R Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.

I was unfortunately unable to be present at the handing over ceremony as I was sick. Nor I have since had an opportunity of visiting the vessel. 2. In conversation with the Sheikh the other day, he mentioned that he would probably be e;oii\j on an extended tour in the vessel sometime during this hot weather. He said that he had not had a lon^ break from Kuwait for some time. It is not possible to let you have any dates for the reason because one of the engines of the vessel is broken down. It appears that the yacht is powered by two Diesel engines of old fashion design, and that the air-blast machinery is defective. This part of one engine cannot be repaired here, and has been sent to Basra but it is doubtful if anything satisfactory can be done. l 1 i H.E.

I doubt whether His Highness adopted ^ this emblem himself ( I thin^; it was more lively put there by the American donors ) ; but I tatce it His Majesty’s Government are interested - as were the Government of India — in style&gt;of address and emblems adopted by the Gulf Shaikhs, and perhaps you would consider whether we are to countenance the sporting of coronets by His Highness.

I discussed the matter with Burrows and he had no particular views on the subject. I imagine in thaold days we should have given the Bheikh a direct order to remove the crown but ^ am not quite sure if we can do this now. I think, perhaps, you might ask him why he has put the crown on his flag and whether it is a type of head-dress he is used to wear ing, and generally pull his leg about it. If you agree would you kindly take action accord ingly? If however you think we should take a stronger line, you will no doubt let me know. G.N.
