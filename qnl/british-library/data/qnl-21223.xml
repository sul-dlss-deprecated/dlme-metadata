V 1 !■ 1900Z/20. fConfj-dent^ a;, D.0.KotC/S68-5/7 20th April 1935. y dear Bclgrave, I wish to have confirmed in writing the principle/on ^hich you agreed after consultation with the Ilonourable the Political Resident with regard to the levying of duty and customs on articles of all kinds imported by His Majesty's Ships to their depots or canteens or clubs or quarters in Bahrain. 2. Firstly, the general principle agreed to was that the Bahrain ^overnaont would follow the practice prevalent at all ports abroad or at foreign ports in regard to this matter. That rjractice is that dutiable articles for the personal use of officers and men of His Majesty*s Ships are allowed to be importec and retained customs free within the precincts of the special area or buildings set aside for their private use ashore. For the aetails applicable to this general principle I would refer you to pages 174 to 178 inclusive, 131, 184, 135 and 139 to 200 of the Indian £ Sea Customs Manual. 3. The details of the decision arrived at by you were that the following articles were to be landed duty free from Kis Majesty 1 s uhips under the conditions mentioned in the preceeding paragraphs (a) Alcoholic and other drinks for exclusive consumption In tuo uien's canteen by Naval ratings. An exception to this would be that u special license would be granted occasionslly to the Canteen to entertain outsiders. (b) Office material and furniture including stationery. (c) government stores. (d) Edibles of all kinds for exclusive consumption in the Canteen. 4. With regard to the Officers' Club we arrived at no definite decision but agreed that:- C. Dalrymple Belgrave ^squire. Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bs-hraln.8. (c) Food tmd drlnics of all kinds imported by His Via^esty's Ships for exclusive consult ion by the Officers within the precincts of their Club should be landed duty free. (f) Furniture for the Officers 1 Club would be dutiable. If you are to be guided by the Indian Sea Customs Act then you will have to allow this further concession. Government of India, F.D (C.Bl, Notification No:47 dated the !iJ5tn June 1927 reads as follows 'In exercise of the power conferred by section 23 of the Sea Customs Act, 1873 (VIII of 1878), the Governor General in Council is pleesed to exempt fror the import (iuty leviable tnereon under the Indian Tariff Act, 18^4 (VIII of 1894), ail articles imported bj or on bahalf of . a Haval Officer serving on any of His Majesty's snips for his personal use.' Under tne circuiwBtances it would probably be better to .^rant this further concession and allow the Officers 1 Club to have their furniture if imported landed duty free. The aniouiit recoverable in any case would be very si!»ali. 5. In view of paragraph 4 (e) above I have told the Senior Kaval Officer in the Persian ^ilf that there is no objection to his having an officers 1 tent pitched within the limits of the iLnd acquired by His kajiesty's Government at Jufair, and of his officerg consuming in it such drink and food as they may bring with them from the Ships. 6. I have written to the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf and the Air Officer Coaimanding, British Forces in 'Iraq, Hinaidi, and impressed on them the necessity for officers and men under their comir.and not consuming: alcoholic drinks out side the special buildings provided for that purpose. 7. Would you please let me know as soon as possible whether you confirm this letter, and what action you propose with regard to paragraph 4 (e) above. On receipt of your reply I propose to send both a copy of this letter and of your reply to the Senior Kaval Officer in the Persian Gulf. I think however before we assume this letter and your reply to it to be the last worn it /would3. would be advisable for the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian tfulf to address iiis Excellency Shaikh Sir Haaad bin 1 Isa A1 Khalifah requesting him to grant the same concession to His Majesty's tihips at Bahrain as the Navy enjoys in other parts of the world and recapitulating therein, what those concessions amount to, and which are set forth above* I think you will have to point out to His Txcellency the Shaikh on receipt of the Senior Saval Officer's letter, that the Navy being here is bring ing real advantage to the Island both on the labour market and in the matter of local purchases - principally of meat, e^gs, milk and siaiiar articles, and that the entertaining to which their presence automatically gives rise in itself stinuiates trade. Yours sincerely.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAI Dear Cole, ^1* *-*$3 I enclose a letter atout Customs dues. I hope it will not 'be considered unsuitable. 1 i The S .N. 0. should have started 'by raising the matter officially in writing. If he will write now to the Shaikh, as you suggest, the matter will be discussed in the usual way by Shaikh Hamed and his brothers and son, in any big matter of this kind that is the usual procedure. It is all very well talking about the general advantages but what the Shaikh is most interested in is increase of revenue, especially after the P.R.'s talk the other day, he says of course that if the British Govt wishes him to waive duties he will have to do so but I think it would be rather a pity if it came to that and I know that the others would make a lot of talk about it.7 GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D.U. No./ 7 ' 6 ^' kraim 1 21, 1935. Dear Cole, I write to acknowledge your D.O. C/262-5/7 of 20th April 1935. 2. 1 have not got a copy of the Indian Sea Customs manual and am not acquainted with the rules laid dom it. The Bahrain government has its own customs regulations which are not identical to customs regulations in other countries, moreover Bahrain is not, like India, a British possession but it is an independent state and its position vis a vis the British Navy differs from the position of India or any British possession, colony or protectorate. 1 think the Navy do not appreciate this distinction in the matter of customs. 1 agree however that Bahrain should be guided by the usual practice, existing in ports of other foreign countries. 3. it was agreed that an exemption from customs duty should be made in respect of imports of the following nature:- (a) Alcoholic and other drinks and edibles for the exclusive consumption of the men's canteen, ^bj Uffice material including stationery, (cj Government stores for His Majesty's ships; in addition to this the bahrain government will waive customs duty on imports of all descriptiondescription whether government stores or other wise which are imported into Bahrain for use in ships but it is understood that goods which are imported and actually used at Jafair are not subject to this exemption except those which are specifically described. (d) tfood and drinks of all kinds imported nis Majesty's ships for the exclusive consump tion of the officers within the precincts of the officers club shall be free from duty. 4. furniture would be dutiable if imported for use at Jafair. 5. 1 entirely agree that the best course would be for the Senior Waval Officer, Persian Gulf to write through you officially to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Jlamad asking him to grant the concession which he requires for the British Navy. 6. His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad fully appreciates the present political advantages and the material advantages which it is hoped will accrue to Bahrain owing to the coming of the Navy, but one of these advantages which he looked forward to was an increase in revenue from customs duties which would affect him more directly. As you aware when he first heard that the Navy was coming he enquired whether he would receive some sort of payment or subsidy for their using Bahrain. I told him that this would not occur but that the public and the govern ment would benefit in other ways. }£ours sincerely,No. 490 H.M.S. 'SHOREHAM' at Bcitiraln. 21st April, 1935. With reference to my conversations with and subsequent correspondence between the Honourable ths Political Resident In the Persian Gulf and yourself, . would you kindly obtain the written approval of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa A1 Khallfah to His Majesty's Ships receiving In Bahrain the same concessions and privileges with regard to exemption from Customs and Duty as they generally enjoy. 2. Briefly those concessions amount to the followlng:- Exemptlon from duty and customs on (a) Alcoholic drinks and food stuffs Imported by His Majesty's Ships for exclusive consumption by Naval ratings within the limits of their concession. (b) Office material and furniture Including stationery. (c) Government stores of all kinds. (d) As regards the Officers' Club J hope the same concession to be granted as In (a) above. 3. Until an officers' Club Is constructed I propose to pitch a tent on Jufalr for use of the Officers In which they may have drink and foodstuffs landed from the ships. 4. I have noted His Excellency the Shaikh's desire that alcoholic liquor be not consumed outside the concession and I have issued orders to that effect. Captain GJA. Cole, The Agency, BAHRAIN.

The honourable ut.-Colonel T.C.Fo le, C.B.i., Political Resident *n the Persian ^uif, Bahrain.f3 CONFIDENTIAL BAHRAIN, June 8th 1935 Dear Cole, In your letter dated 29th May marked ' personal ' about the Navy and the customs question you say that you want to ascertain my views on the matter. This is one of the occasions, fortunately few, when the point of view of the Agency does not coincide with that of the Shaikh and when these occasions occur my own position 'becomes rather difficult. 2. My personal opinion is that the Shaikh has not been treated too well over the whole question of the Naval base. I think he shoul^- have been told about it before it became a fait accompli, on the other hand I know that there were many political reasons for keeping him in the dark about it. I myself constantly urged that he should be informed and I assure you that at times I felt in a very inviduous position knowing all about It and knowing that he never suspected anything. I am quite sure that he had no idea^that the Navy intended to come here. When he was told about it his first reaction was pleasure but almost immediately he began to realise what had happened and then he was not pleased. I think you might give the Shaikh himself credit for realising, without being told by his relations, that the whole matter must have been settled long before he was told anything about it, admittedly his relations are usually quicker in the uptake than he is but in this case the thing was so obvious. His relations, Mohammed and Abdulla and SulmaW. were really very indignant, not at the Navy coming here but at the way in which it was done. Then there was the question of the flag staff at Jafair which caused a lot of feeling. The Shaikhs thought that permission should have been asked before it was put up, the public assumed that the Shaikh's non-appearance ^en it was hoisted at Jafair was a protest against it having been v&amp;t up without permission. It is difficult to convince the people here that such things are customary under such circumstances in other places, they just dont believe it. 3. It was unfortunate, on the top of all this, that the question of free customs should have been raised.and that the Navy should find it impossible to compromise. You are mistaken in thinking that the customs question is a matter of money, it is a question of principle and as it is also a question of principle on the other side I can see no possible solution except that the weaker party, the Shaikh, should give in. This is what he intends to do, when the Shaikh and Abdulla discussed the matter they came to the obvious conclusion that as they did not wish and were unable to contend against the British Government the only thing was to submit.The way they look at it is that it is strange of the British Government to force them, for the sake of a few hundred rupees every year, to give up what they consider are their rights to take customs, after they have of their own accord waived these rights on almost everythir^ which the Navy might import. 4. You mentioned the price of the land bought from the Shaikh. I think it should be known how that price was settled. In 1934 when the C-inC came here I was suddenly asked to give a rough estimate of how much the land was worth. I think I had exactly one day in which to consider the matter, and of course the Shaikh was told nothing about it. There were records of previous sales of land in the immediate neighbourhood in the Land Department and I collected them all and worked out as closely as I could a rough figure representing value per square yard based on the average of previous sales. This was an estimate but it was taken as beinga derinite undertaking to sell at that amount. The whole transaction was condacted entirely by me, the Shaikh never had any say in the question of the price but if he had 'been given an oppo tunity of taking part in the deal he would have demanded at least t7n .ce as much, and presumably he would have got it. Shaikh Eohammed, who claimed most of Jafair, still considers and always will consider that he was very badly treated because in his estimation Jafair is worth as much as all the three sites together. I wonder on what oasis H .I,.G, would take the view that the price of the lands was high. I should much dislike the matter of the land price being mentioned to the Shaikh as an argument about customs because he would almost certainly complain that he was given no opportunity of discussing the price and the price obtained was much less than the land was v/orth. He accepted the price because I told him that it was the price which the British Govei'nment were willing to pay but if I had told him that it was the price which I had assessed the land as being worth he would not have agreed. 5. The suggestion of a payment to the Shaikh for allowing the Navy r to use Bahrain as a base would not have been made by him if. I,on the day when he made it,had got an opportunity to talk over the matter with him. This had nothing whatever to do with the customs question and I know that the Shaikh did not at any time contemplate sach a payment as being compensation for waiving customs duties. 6. The Shaikh is now writing a letter to you, in connection with his previous one, agreeing not to take any customs on the imports referred to in his paragraphs 9 and 10. He is doing this because I have strongly recommended him to take this line. I think at the same time you should know that in my opinion,from the conversations which I have taken part in with the shaikhs, when perhaps they sometimes rather forget that they are talking to an Englishman, Xfc&amp;X the whole affair has been very strongly resented by the Shaikhs and it will give an opportunity to people here who dislike the British Government, and there are quite a lot who do, to say that the British Government has behavea badly to the Shaikh aver the naval base. Yours sincerely.Translation of letter from Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah, to H. B. M T s Political Agent. Bahrain, dated 11th R/Awal 1354, 13th June 1935. We understand from our adviser that the British Navy will not agree to pay customs duty to us on the imports mentioned in para- \ graph 9 and 10 of our letter dated 1st ^afar, 1353. VV r 1 As you are aware we waived our rights to customs duties on all imports for the Navy except those mentioned above so nothing else remains for us and now we are obliged to agree to the wishes of the British govern ment in this matter. ^e wish however to inform you that this matter is not a question of money but it is a question of principle.Confident lal .

It is unlikely that a party of this size will be held more than once a year, at Christmas. Yours H. Weightraan Esq., The Political Agent, BAHRAIN. l, ■■' 1 _ U-* I r\ Office of Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, H.M.S.'Shoreham'. 24th September, 1939. I have been considering the question of the R.A.P, ratings at present in Bahrain and as far as I can see there are very few facilities for them. As you will probably appreciate our men are very well treated by the R.A.P. when at Basrah and I feel I should like to be able to offer their men something here. I am well aware of the reasons for the restrictions placed on the Naval Base, but perhaps in these days of war the Shaikh would be prepared as a special case to allow us to invite the R.A.P. ratings to avail themselves of the facilities in our base. I should like to be able to allow them to use it fully with the one proviso that they would not be allowed to bring in guests under any conditions. Would you be so good as to discuss this matter with Belgrave and ask him to approach the Shaikh for the necessary permission^ In the meantime I am informing Coates that the R.A.P. personnel at Bahrain may use the me^s swimming bath but for the present they cannot use the canteen. / c. H.Weightman Esq.., The Agency, BAHRAIN »D.O. No. C /610-5/7 .a. Dated the 4th October 1939. Please refer to your letter of the 24th September 1939 regarding the use of the Naval Base by Royal Air Force ratings in Bahrain# 2. They may be allowed to avail themselves of the facilities at the Naval Base on condition that they bring in no guests. Vours sineerely f Captain Cosmo li« Graham, R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, K.NUS. Shoreham*The 25th November 1941 Many thanks for your note of yesterday 1 a date about the rum. I must apologise for not having replied you earlier but I had to look up the greement between the Shaikh and the Naval Authorities which governs the Import of liquor for Jufalr* I have Issued a permit which will enable you to Import the consignment rlghtaway* As, I expect, you know this Is a prohibition State and all liquor Is Imported under the permit system* As regards Customs duty, according to the above agree ment it appears that only liquor Imported by the Navy for the Canteen and the Officers' Club, Jufalr, Is eligible for Customs rebate provided It Is consumed within the concession area, l«e» within the boundaries of Jufalr. I do not think that the con signment Imported by you la covered by the Agreement as It Is presumably for private use outside the limits of the con cession area and I fear that I cannot be of much help here.

FINLAY HOUSE, KARACHI. 1st August, 19U4. i» Ma^or T # Hickiribotham, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrein /&lt;MK We have deceived a report from our Manager in^ Bahrein concerning conversations he has had with the Director of Customs recently on the question of the exemption from customs duty of stores which are being imported into Bahrein by our Corporation in connection with the air services which we are operating through the island. As you will be aware, a considerable proportion of the aircraft v/hich we are operating on this route bear^ military markings and are operating virtually as Service aircraft with crews in R.A,}- 1, » uniiorm. As the military situation in the Par East develops and our services over this sector increase, the proportion of 'militarised' services is likely to increase and with it the liaison between iranspor Command R.A.F. and ourselves. At the outbreak of the war the Corporation was placed at the disposal of the Secretary of State for Air and since then has operated to the requirements of H.M. Government, who are directly debited with the costs o- operation and credited with whatever revenue is obtained. Further, upon the establishment of Transport Command R A P. a directive'for the integration of their services and those of the Corporation was issued by the Air Ministry. jnde. thi^ ro charges are raised between Transport Command and n.K.f?oT?.'rpro» 1 ssrvloee. » sisss %'• asrsis*«- consideraljle portion'of our supplies from the R .A .F. Of the materialat -2- material we import a large proportion is used for R.A.P. personnel and needs, and the services which operate into India under R.A.P. markings are accorded service treatment 'by the public authorities. On this basis I am writing to request that the stores which have been and are being imported into Bahrein, should for the duration of the war be exempted from customs duty. A large proportion of our imports during the last few months have been in connection with the establishment of a large transit camp and the erection of additional buildings for the handling of services, housing of spares, accommodation of staff and so forth. These services for the most part are being undertaken for us by the R.A.P. but owing to shortage of material in the Paiforce Command, it has been necessary to send many items from India and elsewhere. Our contention is that such material is Air Ministry property and, belonging to h.m. Government, should not be liable to duty during such time as the Corporation operates its services to the direct instructions of the Air Ministry and co-ordinated v/ith and parallel to the services of Transport Command R.A.F. Such exemption if granted, should logically be made retrospective and should apply to all types of aircraft whether, for the matter of convenience, they continue to onerate under civil markings or whether they are militarised services. The material mentioned above is shipped into _ Bahrein on both types of service depending on the load which is available from day to day for this purpose. I write this letter to you as a D/0 communication as it appears to me to be preferable in the first instance. Should it be desirable for an application to be made in formal terms perhaps you will let me know, when I will see that a suitable official request is sent. Your interest in this matter on our oehalx will be greatly appreciated. I remain. Yours sincerely. Copy to: C .D.Belgrave Esq., 0. Adviser to Bahrein GoveD.O.No.'/ 30th AORuat 19-14.
