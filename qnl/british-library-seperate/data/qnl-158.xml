The first being letters addressed to the Resident's Native Agents throughout the Persian Gulf at Bahrain, Carrack [Bandar-e Chārak], Muscat, Sharjah, and Shiraz. A great deal of this material is of a routine nature; for example, praise for good conduct, reprimands for poor conduct, instructions to forward correspondence, and authorisation for leave. Solicitations for information on a range of topics such as local political affairs, the slave trade in the Gulf, and suspected piratical activity are also common.The second category is made up of letters addressed to various rulers throughout the Persian Gulf. The principal recipients being Shaikh Sulṭān bin Saqr, Hakim of Ra's al-Khaymah; Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah, Hakim of Bahrain; Shaikh Tanoon [Ṭaḥnūn bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān], Hakim of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi]; Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat; and Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān, Governor of Bushire. Much of this correspondence is related to to the Resident's efforts to maintain peace in the Gulf, and ensure the suppression of piracy. It also covers attempts by the Resident to investigate suspected acts of piracy, to facilitate recompense for property plundered at sea, and calls to punish offenders. To a lessor extent, it includes applications for redress for injuries inflicted against British agents, and matters affecting British trade.It should be noted that ff 67-89 are blank folios.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Lingah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Shiraz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrein</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sheraz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aboothabee</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharga</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lingah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sheeraz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Mediation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000017#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
