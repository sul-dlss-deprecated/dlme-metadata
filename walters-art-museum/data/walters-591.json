Panels with radiating star designs evoke the eternal heavens. \r\n\r\nThe maker's full name, carved in the lower right panel, indicates that he was the son of a carpenter and confirms that crafts such as woodcarving were practiced by generations within the same family.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/24342", "Keywords": "Muslim; pattern; calligraphy; decorative; architecture; geometric; Shiite; star", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "early Safavid Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:15:21.317", "Creator": "Qanbar ibn Mahmud (Iranian)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_61.297_VwA_DD_T10.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_61.297_VwA_DD_T10.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_61.297_VwA_DD_T10.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_61.297_VwA_DD_T10.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_61.297_VwA_DD_T10.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667, 1508157", "ExhibIDs": "13", "Images": "PS1_61.297_DetA_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_61.297_DetB_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_61.297_DetC_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_61.297_DetD_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_61.297_DetE_DD_T10.jpg, PS1_61.297_VwA_DD_T10.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Third Floor: Islamic Art"}
