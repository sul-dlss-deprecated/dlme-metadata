Ryan's telegram also reports that King Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd], who has been approached by Italian oil companies, wishes to know whether any British oil companies would be interested.The remaining correspondence reports on communications between the British Government's Petroleum Department and various British oil companies (including the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Shell Group, and the Eastern and General Syndicate) regarding those companies' interest (or lack thereof) in pursuing a concession for either location.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iraq Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Dutch Shell, oil company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Hasa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>ʻAsīr </geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Farsan Islands</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Al-Hasa Province</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000299#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
