The memorandum reproduces a number of representations made by the British Government both directly to the Turkish Porte and through the Persian Government, objecting to the construction of the fort on the grounds that it was said to contravene a Turco-Persian agreement of 1847. By June 1897 the fort is said to have fallen into decay and to be without guns, but the memorandum concludes that the British must resort to other means if construction of the fort is revived. The memorandum is written by Edmund Neel, Political and Secret Department, India Office, and provides a map at folio 19.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Shat-el-Arab</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Fao</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fortifications</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00013f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00013f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
