November 30th, 1934 A » • ?*s' {I /l yf My Lord, 1 have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Head of the British Section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs recently stated to a member of my staff that a report had been received from the Ministry of War to the effect that Jum'eh Khan Ismailz a i, a well-known robber in Persian Baluchistan, had not long ago received some arms via Mashkil in British Baluchis tan and was now engaged in roboery and rebellious activities in theneighbourhood of Bam, Narmashir and Hivan. (The official concerned was in some doubt about this last name and it is possible that Rigan to the South_east of Bam was intended). The Ministry of »/ar requested that the import of arms should be stopped. 2. Mr.Trott mentioned that a somewhat similar rumour, which it was difficult to believe, about the smuggling of arms into Persian Baluchistan had also reached His Majesty's Legation and said that if m.re details as to the number, make, etc. of the arms in question could be furnished, it would facilit ate enquiries. The official concerned was, however, unaole to add anything further. 3. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (No.520), and to His Majesty's Consular Officers at Bushire (No.195), Meshed,(No.88), and Kerman (No.39.).
