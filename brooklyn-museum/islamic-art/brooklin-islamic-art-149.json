Through trade, tribute, gift exchange, and the \r\nspread of religions such as Buddhism, Manichaeism, Judaism, Christianity, \r\nand Islam, imagery associated with one artistic tradition was often adapted \r\nor incorporated in another cultural context. Motifs that appear across the arts \r\nof China, Central Asia, and the Islamic world include fantastical animals such \r\nas dragons and phoenixes; cloud bands and cloud collar motifs; and flowers \r\nsuch as lotuses and peonies. Yet the meanings linked to these motifs often \r\ndid not transfer from one context to the next. Similar imagery could exist \r\nsimultaneously in several regions while signifying different things.</p><p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Iranian potters developed a stone paste body also known as \r\nfritware, intended to imitate the smooth white surface of Chinese porcelain. \r\nThis fritware bowl depicting birds in flight against a background of large-scale \r\nfoliage and lotus flowers represents a Mongol Ilkhanid interpretation of the \r\nChinese lotus, a flower unknown in Iran.</p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.36.943.jpg", "id": 26922, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.36.943.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.36.943.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 82}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 165}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 330}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 661}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1322}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.36.943.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Bowl with Flying Birds and Lotuses</em>, 14th century.
