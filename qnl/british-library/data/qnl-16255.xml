It is also informing the Imam that the British Expedition being assembled to attack Ruselkhima (also spelt Roosekhyma) will sail from Bombay within the fortnight. It also requests his assistance with securing fresh provisions from Muscat, the assistance of any military forces he can provide, and outlines the measures he can take to assist with the disembarkation of artillery.2. A copy of a letter from Sir Evan Nepean, Baronet, Governor of Bombay to the Prince at Shiraze [Shiraz], dated 9 October 1819.The letter explains that the Lingua [Bandar-e-Lengeh] boat captured by HMS
                           Curlewis understood to have been engaged in piratical activity, therefore the actions of the
                           Curlewdo not constitute a violation of the treaties with Persia. It further notes that a number of reports of pirate activity do not appear to have been acted on by the Government in Shiraz.The prince is informed that a British expedition is being prepared to attack Ruselkhima and end piracy in the Gulf. It is further explained that any military assistance the Persians can provide will be welcome and will go some way to restoring Persian authority in the region; the British believe that this will prevent pirate activity in the future.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024197022.0x000109#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
