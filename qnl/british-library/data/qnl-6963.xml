[Repeated to Delhi, Cairo a,nd Teheran.) 3G00. My immediately preceding telegram. Reference High Commissioner's telegram dated 1st March, No. 271, to Foreign Office. Fact that Abdulla appears to have been declared King of Mesopotamia simultaneously with declaration of Faisal as King of Syria, &amp;(i., seems to indicate that even in Syria it is recognised that Mesopotamia is entitled to its own Government. Unless we regard ourselves as pledged by our commitments of 1915 to King Husain to regard Mesopotamia as an integral part of any Arab kingdom which may be set up in Syria, I submit that we should make it clear that the Anglo-French declaration of 8th November binds us to set up in conformity with the wishes of the people of Mesopotamia an indigenous Government independent of that of Syria. There is no community of feeling whatever between Syria and Mesopotamia, and the people of this country are as little likely as those of Nejd to accept a Government inaugurated in Syria and dominated by Syrian politicians. So far from making the Arabs on this side our friends, recognition of Faisal as King of Mesopotamia can only be regarded in this country as a betrayal of its interests and we shall alienate the best elements here. 10 1936 50 7/20 A9 A Committee under the presidency of Sir Edgar Bon-hatn-( arter is now engaged in preparing a scheme on the lines outlined in my immediately preceding telegram, and on hearing from Government that my proposals are generally approved T shall be (? groups omitted) public announcement which should be an Elective counterblast so far as this country is concerned to any announcement that Faisal may make regaidmg this country. 3. (P 3425) Telcnram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 21th April 19^0. CR.) 5110. Committee consists of Sir E. Bonham-Carter, President; Messrs. Balfour, Soudan Civil Service; Howell, Indian Civil Service; Tyler, Indian Civil Service, members ; Bullard, Levantine Consular Service, Secretary. My instructions to Committee were to frame specific proposals as promised in my telegram of J 9th March, No. 3517, for establishment of a Constitutional Government in this country consistent with Article 22 of League of Nations, the Anglo-French Declaration of 8th November 191.S, and other public pronouncements. The whole of the correspondence upon the subject of the future of Mesopotamia between this Office and the Secretary of State for India was placed before them in print, and their attention was called to your telegrams of 28th November 1918 and (? 14th 1'ebruary) 1919 - Individual members of the Committee have discussed (? sequence of) questions at issue freely wdth individual local notables of weight and standing and have invited the views of certain political officers, but have not called on individuals formally to give evidence. Brief summary of report of Committee follows. 4. (P 3473) Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 27th April 1920. (R.) 5111. My immediately preceding telegram. 1. Committee summarises conditions which constitution must fulfil as follows :— (а) Subject to tutelage of a mandatory Power, the Government must be powerful indigenous Government. (б) The form of government must be adopted by free will of people, subject to such powers as are necessary to enable the mandatory nation to give effect to its mandate. (c) The constitution must contain necessary securities to enable the mandatory Power to perform the trust confided to it of # censuring the well-being and development of the people. This implies the maintenance of peace and order. 2. Committee drawls attention to the followinof factors which require consideration in this connection (corrupt group) : — [а) The population of Mesopotamia consists roughly of a million Sunnis and one and half million Shiahs, the former being in large majority in north and latter in south, dividing line being drawn roughly east and west of (corrupt group) Baghdad. (б) Shiah sect has for many generations been oppressed. They were not recognised in schools or courts, their teachers were excluded from public benefits. (c) Shiah tenets are, however, a potential source of difficulty to any Government, for it is claimed that decisions of Mujtabids transcend those of any secular authority. (d) There is at present a tendency for Shiahs and Sunnis to coalesce, but this is a result of our occupation, and were we to withdraw, an open rupture between the two sects would follow very soon. (e) Tribal feeling is stronger than racial feeling amongst tribal Arabs. The Turks neither had force nor wisdom requisite to maintain control over tribes, and for some years before the war the lower Euphrates had been in a state of armed rebellion. Tribesmen despise townspeople, whotwo dasses, ai^dbhones^^dak^in mC - re I a 1 Sed estr . ail gement between the made feeling still Ce acute ' app0mted from have n Suoh^^inistrat?ve 0 pos?s a^ wlr^S^ bytcT 8 TT' 6 by Turks - paid and did not attract 8 the bel'ter classes ^ P 0 ,' ,y value, and m this respect it differs materia^fronfS'arir^s^n (g) The standard of education in this countrv k va ^ t a test s *£; &amp;£tszas ^(nSsgcsr ' wLo - (h) I he present adnnmstration have had great difficulty in finding Mohammedans a) c ? 5 e ^ en 0 • Weradmmist^ative ( ?a PP ointments )• ^ ee (leslre t0 place it on record definitely that in the tribal areas for many years to come direct control by British officers is a sine, qua non since no one else commands confidence of people to a degree whfch will ensuic obedience of orders of Government without presence and not infrequent use of armed force. 3. There is no difficulty in framing on paper a nonsensical constitution. The uiks were adepts at art, but trickery lies in framing a form of government which will give a real power to native elements and yet hold out reasonable prospects of niamtaming peace, law and liberty. And this can only be done if safeguards are introduced to overcome above difficulties. 4. The committee consider it necessary that:— (а) Fuller attempts should be made to ascertain the wishes of the people, but consider that before this can be done with a hope of success a mandate must be granted. (б) After grant of mandate the government of the country must be carried on for a short time under a provisional constitution to allow for country to settle down. (c) They consider it impossible to elicit frankly expressed opinion until a mandate has been granted and extremely difficult for some time after wards, and urge that this should be done soon. They express the opinion that it is desirable that the mandate should state that mandatory Power is vested with necessary powers to carry out mandate. 5. They recommend formation of a Legislative Assembly on lines proposed below, whose opinion as to nature of constitution, subject to limits imposed by terms of mandate, should be ascertained not later than two years from date of mandate, till when the country should be governed under provisional constitution outlined below. 6. Committee makes special recommendations regarding terms of mandate, which should be embodied in documents establishing a provisional constitution. 7. Reservation of authority of mandatory Power :— (а) Committee consider that documents establishing constitution should make it clear that mandatory Power possesses necessary powers to fulfil mandate. (б) External affairs, foreign relations, including treaties and (corrupt group) should be reserved to mandatory Power. (c) As regards internal affairs, it should be made clear that mandatory 1 ower has vright to insist that its advice on matters which it consiuers essential for u well-being and development of the people' be followed. , {d) Reservation will also be necessary regarding foreign subjects and religious (e) Committee remark that if these powers are laid down in the constitution much misunderstanding will be avoided, and observe that a great dea 1 of the bitterness now existing in Egypt is due to the undefined po&amp;ition which Great Britain has occupied in that country.4 (/) Committee do not recommend appointment of an Amir at present, although such appointment would in theory facilitate establishment of an Aiab State on lines desired by His Majesty's Government, but it will be open legislative assembly in two years, or sooner if High Commissioner thinks it desirable, to make recommendations in this connection lor consideration of the mandatory Power. 5. (P 3385) Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 27i/i April 1920. (R.) 5112. My immediately preceding telegrams. Under provisional constitution Government would be carried on by Council of State and a Legislative Assembly. Council of State. (1) To be the principal executive authority and a second chamber of legislature, (? all) State executive decisions and executive decisions of departments issued to public to issue in its name. (2) To consist of, say, 11 members and president, all (corrupt group) nominated by High Commissioner. (3) President to be an Arab of good status and prestige, and not necessarily connected with a Government Department. (4) Members to be either Arab members for departments or British secretaries for departments (British secretaries remain chief executive authority of departments, but Arab members for departments to be consulted on all important matters, and have access to all papers. In some departments, i.e., Public Works Department, there would be no Arab member, but an Arab adviser or assistant). (5) The constitution should not specify relative numbers of British and Arab members (it can in practice). At first there would be English majority, for example, six to five who might represent following departments :— Arabs : Interior, Justice, Revenue, Education, Auqaf; British ; Interior, Justice, Revenue, Education, Finance, Public Works Department. A department with no secretary or member on the Council would be represented by a representative of some ether department. (6) High Commissioner to have power over the ruling decisions of Council of State. (7) Members of Council not necessarily to be chosen from Legislative Assembly, but to be ex-ofiicio members of Legislative Assembly with right to vote for Legislative Assembly. See my next telegram. 6. (P 3405) Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 27th April 1920. (R.) 5113. Legislative Assembly. 1. Members to be elected or preferably chosen by elective local bodies. Method of election requires further study and consultation with local authorities, but Committee consider election by local bodies, which would be really representative, quite practicable and put up tentative proposals. 2. To number 50 members and consist of:— (1) Elected members for town and country at rate of one member to about 50,000 inhabitants. (2) Members elected separately by Jewish and Christian communities. (3) Arab members of council. 3. President to be an Arab nominated by Council of State. Owing to lack of experience of Arabs in public affairs he would not necessarily be chosen from elected members (? or any of the) functionaries of the Legislative Assembly :— (1) The Egyptian organic law of 1913 may serve as a precedent subject to modifications. (2) Laws to be issued and taxes imposed by Council of State normally with concurrence of Legislative Assembly but without this concurrence. If x\ssembly refuse to pass law after joint sessions and submission of law a second time Committee to consider it essential to retain for Council of State power to pass without Assembly's concurrence in case of necessity.Tm-kieh CoQstitwion tn pass' temporarj laifs &lt; £ ndl l Y owl* (.) i''' rs '* r , rp. constitutional matters aud taxation m Ie g Isla tion except as regards w »• -r lem ^ must explain reasons.^ 0 tUnia ' if Governmen t does not accept ( ) Annual budget to be issued by decree of fSnn^'i ^ a submitted to Legislative Assembly for adviop \ ^ ^ tate ^ ^'Previously offered is not accepted ica^Z mnst hi r ' obse '; vatl on S .

' It ib, I belie\e, a fact that a number of tribal Sheikhs of the Shamiyah division and some from elsewhere, have recently been prevailed on by religious leaders to sign a declaration in favour of Abdulla, but I do not regard this as indicative of public opinion. The section opposed to Abdulla includes many elder notables and Baghdadis who have recently arrived from Syria and some Baghdadis still in Syria who have seen practical results of an autocratic Arab Government, and are strongly opposed to it on practical grounds. This party assures me that Abdulla himself has no intention of coming here unless with our active support, that the appointment of Zaid as Regent is not intended to be taken seriously, and that nomination of Abdulla was engineered by Faisal in order to strengthen his own position in Syria. His negotiations with Bin Saud are doubtless similarly inspired. The other current opinion is pro-Turk. The pro-Turk party includes many ex-Turkish officials and a large number of ex-Turkish military officers who can raise from released or escaped prisoners of war a fairly formidable body of rioters. This party appears to have recently received accessions to its ranks from leading Jews and others who prefer us to remain in effective charge, but see in recent pronouncements at home an indication that such may not be the intention of His Majesty's Government. This group also obtained considerable support froiji Najaf, and Kerbela where some of the Mujtahids are understood to be advocating the return of the Turks as advisers to an Arab Government. A recent speech in Parliament regarding Mesopotamia by Secretary of State for War reported in Renter telegram of 26th March, and disturbances which took place at Jerusalem at Easter, have encouraged extremists. 1936 , B6 Continued uncertainty as to future lies at the bottom of these movements. Pro-Turks cling to the belief, in which they find much support, in English papers that we shall not remain here and that the Turks will return. Arabs from the same material draw different deductions and are anxious to stake out their claims. 8. (P 3549) Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 1st May 1920. (R.) 5306. My telegram dated 27th April. Constitutional proposals. The Committee's views generally concur, and their special recommendations have my entire support. I recommend their provisional anceptance by His Majesty's Government, and I would ask authority to issue forthwith an announcement of our intentions on general lines, particularly reference to the appointment of a Council of State, and, eventually, a Legislative Assembly. I do not recommend the appointment of the Council of State until the terms of the mandate are known ; unless it involves undue delay, say, for six months. I am anxious that a definite announcement in general terms should be issued to the public before the Shah's visit, which coincides with Ramadhan, and I should propose simultaneously to circulate privately to a few individuals a precis of the salient points of the Committee's report. 1 shall be glad to know if His Majesty's Government feel themselves able to agree to this. Time is an important factor, and position will be very much eased if some announcement of our proposals can be made to the public simultaneously with announcement of the terms of peace with Turkey, which, I gather, must be expected during present month. 9. Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated Sth May 1920. 5557. Renter telegram from San Remo, dated 22nd April, announced British mandate for Mesopotamia. As it was impossible to suppress the news, it was published in the Baghdad Times on 30th April. On 3rd May communique on the subject was issued, which is despatched in my next telegram. 10. (P 3684) Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Bagadad, dated Sth May 1920. 5558. The mandate for Mesopotamia. The announcement has been made by Renter in London that the San Remo Conference has decided to entrust Britain with the mandate for Mesopotamia and Palestine, and France with the mandate for Syria. The inhabitants of Mesopotamia may rest assured that the British Government has not accepted the allotted task without full realisation of the responsibility it applies. Hie position of mandatory makes high demands upon any Power which strives to fulfil the intentions of the League of Kations under which it works. The ideal at which it must aim is the creation of a healthy body politic, guided and controlled by healthy public opinion. Care for the material prosperity of the mandated country would not alone suffice for the attainment of this end. It is the duty of the mandatory Power to act the part of a wise and far-seeing guardian who makes the provision for the training of his charge, with a view to fitting him to take his place in the world of men. Mesopotamia has suffered under centuries of misrule, during which the versa- tilit} of her people and the productivity of her lands have been checked or stayed Ihe memorials of her past strength over the length and breadth of Mesopotamia bear witness to the civilisation which was created by the ancestors of the existing population out of lesouices which have not diminished. It is the creative power of the people which has been held in abeyance by tlie lethargy and indifference of their ruler-s. Reconstruction will not be the work of a day, but with a race such as the Arabs quick to iearn and eager to seek advantage from the attainments of science, progress should be rapid. Already the signs of revival are everywhere apparent. Security has replaced disorder, the barren waste blossoms into fertility, the poor man is safe from oppression, and the rich enjoys his wealth in peace. Such results could not have been accomplished without the help and co-operation of the people themselves and it is upon this spirit of co-operation that the British Government relies.

(P 4593) Telegram from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated Sth June 1920. (Copy to General Officer Cowmanding-in-Chief hy despatch rider, repeated to Teheran and India.) , 6948. Secret. , . . • £ at + • T Recent developments have caused review of whole situation of Mesopotamia, arising out of the announcement of grant of mandate and its reception by pubhe m this conn rv Anticipations recorded in first part of my telegram of 16th November 1918 and in para No 4 of my telegram of the 10th December, are neanng realisation. II During the last 18 months, progress of demobilisation, withdrawal of exnerienced civil officers and their departure on leave have given men of all classes m this country reason to doubt whether we are prepared or are m a position to give effect to our obligations under mandate. Speeches in Parliament and newspaper opinions quoted in Renter's have emphasised these doubts. III Our Army is now, alike in numbers, composition and fighting efficiency, incapable of defending the population of frontier divisions of Mosul and Dulaim against aggression, and of maintaining, or, in case of need, restoring internal order over any considerable area. IV Both the above divisions were protected from Sharifian aggression up till October last by the Dair-az-Zor division; its separation from Mesopotamia by Peace Conference and circumstance of its seizure by Arabs (? crossing the frontier), led to a succession of incidents, cumulative effect of which threatens to be disastrous, the latest incident being the outrage of Tel Afar. V Last February I \yarned Government that we must hold what w T e then had with the troops then in the country, or clear out,, and that there was no middle course. Events have shown that this was not an over-statement. YI The garrison has been further reduced, with the result that we have had to abandon area (corrupt group) holding. The geographical situation of the country, the nature of its frontier and the disposition of its inhabitants and neighbours is such that the abandonment of control of any considerable part of Mesopotamia involves evacuation of whole, excepting Basra. VII. The history of this country for the past few thousand years, and the practical experience of the past three, alike convince me that we cannot give effect to mandate without risk of disaster, unless we are prepared to maintain for the next two years at least as many troops in the country as we now have, and in a state considerably more efficient than they are now, and to complete so-called military lines to Hit, Qaiyara, Kirkuk at once. VIII. Unless we can regain possession of Dair-az-Zor up to Rakka inclusive, as part of Mesopotamia, and maintain our hold on it hereafter, we shall have to keep more and not less troops than we now have. Its re-occupation would, I believe, for the present at all events put an end to most of our difficulties, but it would require more troops and much more transport than we now have available. IX. Whilst acting in accordance with spirit and, so far as may be, with letter of mandate, we cannot maintain our position as mandatory by a policy of conciliation of extremists.

Now that the policy has been settled, it is more necessary that His Majesty's Government should realise what the execution of the mandate is likely to entail in immediate luture, and that it should make its dispositions accordingly. Announcement on lines ordered in your telegrams of 7th June will be made at the end of Ramazan, about 18th June. It will doubtless evoke lively protests from extremists, who will (demand ?) complete independence, and further demonstrations may be engineered. I propose to meet situation by suggesting that deputation from Mesopotamia of not more than eight persons in all from various parts of the country should proceed to England to lay their views before His Majesty's Government. There is reason to think this proposal, which I hope to secure spontaneously from them, will be favourably received. As soon as deputation has started, or been decided on, I consider we shall have gone as far as we can in the direction of conciliation, and 1 shall feel myself strong enough to take drastic action against the small gang of leading irreconcilables, whose increasing influence constitutes a public danger, and whose suppression is urged on me almost every day by leading men all over the country. This will put heart into moderates and facilitate formation of a centre party which does not at present exist, with the result that extremists have the stage to themselves. It would be of great assistance to me to know what reception an application from such a deputation to visit London would be likely to receive from His Majesty's Government in the event of its being submitted and endorsed by me. 1936 c10 16.

Acting Civil Commissioner made on 20th June following further announcement in regard to policy of His Majesty's Government in Mesopotamia:— ' His Majesty's Government having been entrusted with the mandate of Mesopotamia anticipate that the mandate will constitute Mesopotamia as independent State under guarantee of the League of Nations, and subject to the mandate of Great Britain that it will lay on them the responsibility for the maintenance of internal peace and external security, and will require them to formulate an organic law to be framed in consultation with the people of Mesopotamia, and with due regard to the rights, wishes and interests of all the communities of the country. The mandate will contain provisions to facilitate development of Mesopotamia as a self-governing State until such time as it can stand by itself, when the mandate will come to an end. The inception of this task His Majesty's Government have decided to entrust to Sir P. Cox, who will accordingly return to Baghdad in the autumn and will resume his position, on the termination of the existing military administration, as Chief British representative in Mesopotamia. Sir P. Cox will be authorised to call into being as provisional bodies a Council of State under an Arab President and a General Elective Assembly, representative of and freely elected by the population of Mesopotamia, and it will be his duty to prepare in consultation with the General Elective Assembly the permanent organic law.' 19.
