Commonwealth Relations Downing Street, LONDON. S.W.No.G/lQOS BRITISH IVZIA STh.AM NAVIGATION CO. LTD. ' Bombay 28th November, 47 * r ' ) The Political Resident, Persian Gulf Residency, ^ ' Bahrain Dear Sir, , Your letter No.l889-S dated 3rd November is just to hand ahd has crossed ours No.G./707 dated the 17th of November. % Every effort was made by us to include Muscat in the East Mail Service maintained by the 'Dwarka' and M Dumra M but unfortunately the light .of experience showed that this was not possible. As you are now doubt aware port facilities at Muscat are practically non-existent, and in spite of frequent representations to the authorit ies for an extension to the wharf or the building of a godown at that port to facilitate the quick turn-round of cargo barges, no action has been taken and from all accounts it appears unlikely that any action will be taken. Delays at Muscat are therefore unavoidable and these, with the present shortage of passenger vessels, we cannot afford unless the entire Gulf programme be dis rupted, which, would be to nobody^ advantage. We have therefore reluctantly had to withdraw Muscat from the schedule of the 'Dumra' and 'Dwarka”. We consider, however, that with the curtailed resources it our disposa the connections between Muscat and Bahrain, and vice- versa as enumerated in our letter of 17th instant are, in the circumstances, reasonable. At the present moment unfortunately programmes have been still further disorganised, due firstly to the four days enforced quarantine in the Basrah River, and secondly to the strike of all labour at this port, butonce conditions return to normal we hoj^ the 'Dumra M and 'Dwarka' v/ill maintain their present Fast Service programme with regularity. As you are aware, the B.I. Company lost over 50% of its ships during the war and, although delivery of new vessels has now commerced, it is still short of tonnage, j^rticularlv passenger tonnage. The position has been x *rther aggravated, as explained in our letter of the 17th instant, by the fact that we have to employ four passenger vessels between Bombay and Karachi to cover the movement of troops, Government' employees and evacuees between the two Dominions. The urgency of this movement is so great that in order to secure the greatest number of round voyages in the shortest possible ifre'no cargo whatsoever is carried in any of these ships in either 'direction. Mi In case it should be thought that the Company . has not fairly apportioned its available passenger ships amongst its various Eastern Services and that the Persian Gulf Services have been denuded to the advantage of other services, we would mention that prior to the war the Company operated ei£ht passenger vessels in the Persian Gulf as against the four/five now available. On the other hand in the Bay of Bengal the Company, prewar, ep operated twenty-one passenger vessels as against nine at the present time. In the light of this you will, we think, agree that the Persian Gulf has not been un fairly treated. We attach for your information copie s of the various programmes which it is our intention will be maintained by the Company's vessels on the Persian Gulf Service in the immediate future. • Yours faithfully, Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co Agents. ' LB'dD No.gsie-s PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. the 22nd December 1947 Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co BOMBAY 'ear Sirs, dated the 28th November, 1947. 2. I enclose a copy of some comments I have received from the Political A|;ent Muscat on your letter. 3. I have visited Muscat recently mpself and received complaints from serwral sources regarding the withdrawal of the fast mail service. These complaints are based largely on the long delays that occur without this service in the receipt and despatch of mails. 4. I would therefore most strongly urge that as suggested by the Political Agent and as requested by all the local merchants the fast mail service should be restored but that if time cannot be spared for dealing with cargo a halt should be made for the picking up and setting down of mails and passengers only. Yours faithfully Sd/- W.R. Hay. Political Resident, Persian Gulf •LB*2. Some months ago, in June to be exact, the Captain of the ”Dumra M comp3.ained to me about delays in unloading of cargo at Muscat due to the fact that the cargo barges cannot go alongside the Customs wharf at low tide. He said that Mackinnon Mackenzie Jiad complained about this for some time, but that no ittention had been paid to their complaints. I was somewhat surprised as I have not hitherto come across any correspondence, on my files on this subject. I agreed, however, to look into the matter. On my return I made enquiries, as a result of which it transpires that there had indeed been correspondence on this subject exchanged between Mackinnon Mackenzie and the Agent of Gray Mackenzie in Muscat. The Agent claims that he had made representations to the State without success; he had not, however, at any time asked for the assistance of the Consulate in this matter. 3. It is clear that an expensive extension to the Customs wharf could not be made without the sanction of the Sultan. While agreeing therefore to raise the matter with the Muscat Government at the earliest possible opportunity, I told the Agent of Gray Mackenzie and the Captain of the ’‘Dumra** on his return voyage, that nothing could be done until the Sultan's return from Dhofar. As an alternative to the extension of the Customs wharf, the Captain of the 'Dumra' mas of the opinion that the difficulty might be overcome if cargo was discharged at Matrah instead of Muscat. This, while creating no special difficultj m&amp;ght-fee-eve? or expense would entail the transfer of a large part of the Customs Staff from Muscat to Matra a step which the Director General of Customs while agreeing may be a practical proposition, feels he cannot take until he has referred the matter to the Sultan on his return from Dhofar. Thus the matter stands. In point of actual fact however whether the wharf is extended or not, or whether the Customs are .2 transferred from Muscat to Matra or not, I sincerely believe that due to the fact that in Muscat, the Doctor and Marges are invariably waiting for the ship, the B.I. mail steamers experience less delay in Muscat than in any other port in the Persian Gulf. Indedd during the course of conversation with different -aptains of the mail steamers, they have admitted this. 4. Almost as important as a regular call to lift cargo is a regular delivery of mails, and passen ger service and I would earnestly request that it may be impressed on Mackinnon and Mackenzie that even though the ^s” are not able to spare time to ship heavy and large cargoes they should stop at Muscat for the hour or hour and a half which would be sufficient to pick up and land passengers and mail.

The position is that under the terms of an agreement dated 2oth August 1939 between the Government of India and the British Indian $team Navigation Company, the latter undertook to perform a weekly service between Karachi and Basra in each direction via the Persian Gulf ports. As you knew, the company's services have been irregular since the outbreak of war owing to the requisitioning of a number of their ships. 3ts and Telegraphs Department have =pondence with the British Indian ''rding the resumption of but r-he Campany replied that the position in regard to their ships is unchanged notwithstanding the cessation of hostilities and they can do nothing to restore their regular service until their requisitioned ships are released by the Sea Transport. 4. Our enquiries from the ministry of 7ar Transport's Representative here show that befxe the war there were three fast and three slew vessels on the Persian Gulf service from Bombay, viz. the V\S1 x he TIT A, the V. RSC7 , and/or the YAHtXA and the BARF I 7 'A, the BaRJORAi the BtR 3U and/or the 3 1 ' DR A» of which tx all except the BaRJORA and the BAR ALA have been requisitioned for [.aval duties, at present, there are only three regular steamers on the Persian Gulf run, viz. the 3..*RALA» the B;wRJ0RA and the gSII’ f 1* althou.jh the service the nds Jo , aing to the i imstry of ar Transport Rrpresentative, little or no prospect of any of the requisitioned British India 4 - 4 . i- 4. 4 n 'U * T _ 1 ** o ^ - 1 **'- 4 ;v .-v» J *• AXJ. yta.

The position therefore is that, for reasons which for the tirae being * the CrOvernmenT, of Indie are not in a position to contest.there is no real prospect of any substantial increase in the number of British India Steam navigation Company ships on the Persian G-ulf service before nerb 'pring. In these circumstances it is essential that the few ships available should be used to the greatest possible advantage of all the Persian Gulf ports ana undue preference should not- be given to passengers*and cargo from and for Iraq.

The Government of India are bound therefore to cress strongly that the inisfcry of War Transport themselves be invited to direct their Representative at Basra to arrange for the fullest possible service to be aihurded to all the Persian Gulf ports by every ship at his disposal. 6.

The last mail steamer that called at Doth Bushire and Muscat on the inward voyage was the 'Bar^ora' which called at Bushire on the 26th tiepteraber and at Muscat about the beginning of October. Subsequently the 'Tsinan' called at Bushire on the 9th October without calling at Muscat, and the 'Barala' on the 17th also without calling at Muscat# 3. Cn arriving et Bahrain on the 21st October I discovered that the 'Grade11' from Basra had called at Bahrain on the 16th October en route for Muscat and Bombay. 4# Consequent on the withdrawal of the 'Resang' in 1944 the M.W.T. assured us that they would give us every assistance with regular B.I. ships, and asked us to keep them advised of our requirements (Basra Consulate telegram No. 25, dated the l^th June 1344 - copy enclosed). In their telegram No. 121007/S, dated the 12th July 1944, the L.VY.T. informed us that all vessels calling at Bushire would also call at Bahrain inward, and as recently as August of this year we had occasion to remind the* of this undertaking when the M.Vf.T. informed us • a that the 'Barjora' calling at bushire, was unlikely to call at Bahrain (it event.-ally did). It will be seen that the M. 7.T. (a) did not inform us that the 'Orac^el!' was not calling at Bushire, although they must have known this during the exchange of telegrams referred to in paragraph 1 above. (b) refused to divert the 'Barala' to Muscat although they knew that the 'Tsinan' had not called there and that the 'Grade11' had missed out Bushire; and must have known that there was no likelihood of another inward itinerary including both Bushire and Muscat for a consider -able period. (As we have not yet heard of the departure from Karachi of the next outward mail steamer, ifc Is unlikely to reach Muscat - if Indeed it is routed thero - on the return voyage before end of November). 6# The foregoing sufficiently illustrates, I think, the lack of co-operation displayed by the M.W.X#, Basra, and their indifference to the maintenance of communications in the Gulf. I trust the Government of India will take up the natter strongly. 7# I am sending a copy of this letter and the connected correspondence to Donaldson. ^ V Yours sincerely 3d/- A.^. Galloway.

I should think that there is strong objection to the H.W.T. showing the British India Company a copy,of our letter of the 29th August. I ha.ve spoken to Sir £. Pr£or and he says that the important thing is to get a regular Gulf mail service restored as soon as possible, and suggests we might telegraph the Government 01 india, asking what they are doing about it now that the Japanese war is finished. draft telegrab to Sir 0. Caroe is submitted accordingly. I concur in the draft telegram. But as regards the draft letter to Mr. Nicholson I do not think that it is correct to say that the matter is capable of settlement in India. Mr. hicholson’s letter does not say this. The position is that the approval of MWT would almost certainly be necessary for the steps required to remedy the situation but that they are not prepared to consider acting in the matter except on the basis of a report from their representative in India. Moreover I do not myself see any objection to MWT sending to their / undesirable4 ■■ * V undesirable on account of the references in the letter to Russia for it to be shown as it stands •*“\ to the British India Company, this point could be safeguarded by our stipulating that a copy should not be given to the B.I.Company but that its substance should be discussed with them. I should have thought that there was some advantage in MWT taking up the matter with their representative in India as they offer to do so at the same time as we ask the Government of India to take it up with their representative. Mr. Masson is in the process of being succeeded by someone else and the new man may be a bit cautious in going far to meet the Government of India unless the Ministry in London demonstrate to him that they are interested. I I also sugrest that you send to the Government of India and to the Acting Resident in the Gulf a copy of the correspondence with MWT, so that they knoY/ exactly what point we have taken up with MWT. V&gt;(q.LE COPY Gy 1945 14 th September, 1945 Dear Donaldson, * I spoke to you the other day about your letter of 29 th August on the Persian Gulf ports, which had come to me in Griffiths' absence. On matters of this kind it would be very much easier if the authorities in India would discuss their difficulties frankly with our Representative and with the British India Company. All we can do is to pass out to our Representative a copy of your letter and of the telegram attached thereto and ask him to discuss it with the British India Company and report. Before doing so I shall be glad to know that there is no objection on your part to these papers being shown to the B.I. Unfortunately it was necessary early in the war to withdraw nearly all the vessels regularly employed in this trade, and we are not yet able to replace them. As a result we have had to maintain rather a 'scratch' service, and to cut out calls at ports where there is very little traffic. The British India Company are not free agents in the matter, as your letter seems to suggest, but have been operating the service under the control of our Representative since early in 1940.

If the approach is made now they might also base a refusal on Indian port difficulties. /r ''p/ - SW7 0/^.5 ERAST LETTER. To: P.A.

One particular means of dealing with the situation^ to vhich the Political Resident in the Gulf has drawn attention, would be the improvement of the shipping services to the Persian ports (apart from Khorra^shahr). I enclose a copy of telegram . / to the Government of India, No, 7^7 of 19th April, in which he sets out the position. On this the Government of India are doing what they can to arrange that full facilities for loading and discharging cargo at the various ports are regularly given by the ships now available. But the British India Steamship Company &gt; whose cooperation in the matter would be essential to success ^are not of course on the Indian Registern &gt;&gt; with the British India Company that in the operation of their ships they should be a bit more considerate of the interests of Bushire, O Linfih and Bfcndar Abbas; The political aspects of the matter are cppttie important and it does themselves out much in order to provide a remedy. If the difficulty is that ships are held up at these ports an unreasonable time owing to factors which it should be possible to deal with, we have no doubt that if a precise statement of these difficulties could be given to the Political Resident he could do something to improve matters. It looks as if the difficulty does not arise owing to shortage of ships in the Gulf, /DRAFT LETTER Ministry of War Transport, Berkeley Square House, Berkeley Square, W.l.

I think that we should argue the matter with MWT on that basis rather than ask for additional ships for the Persian Gulf alone, as this might result in the MWT Representative in India being instructed to use his existing fleet more in the Persian Gulf at the expense of the Indian coast. I can of course appreciate MWT’s reluctance to see their ships held up at Persian Gulf ports owing to the inefficiency of the arrangements there for loading and unloading cargo and this is a matter which will have to be looked into if we are to expect them to do very much to help us.PILE copy u iJ J It ^ 1.

We are of course in full agreement with Prior’s views on the importance of preserving the economic entity of the South Persian'littoral and stimulating British and Indian trade with South Persia. While the provision of additional shipping for the Gulf ports must necessarily await its release by the allied fitt ing services, a good deal has already been done in .the way of strengthening India’s trade connections with Persia. An Indian Trade Commissioner has been sent to ‘Tehran and another is to be appointed to Basra who will concern himself with the expansion of trade in the rersian Gulf: exhibitions of Indian products have been arranged in Persia with a view to popularising them, and commercial publicity has been given by means of pamphlets and films j technical training has been arran ged in India for Persian students: and w stepe have been proposed to relax control on the import of^goods to the rersian Gulf Bhaikhdoms from the United Kingdom and horth America and to permit the export of cotton piece- goods and ’gur’ from India to the South Persian littoraL This brief recital will show that India is not only closely interested in the rehabilitation_n£^t.hQ economic life of south Persia but is aiteOuihg vSSfcf.ite possible m present circumstances to reBwPe'tm prosperity of the Gulf ports.

O O r . i u i . , I have the honour to enclose for Your Excellency’s iniortiiation_ copies of a note by Mr j Consul Ko.;ers %ith toich l am m general agreement.

The British and Indian long-term interest and policy demands that we should ma.ce every eiiort m our power to maintain the prosperity cn. the ports along the southern littoral, where “with our ieet in salt water' we shall be certain not only of a good will that has come aown to us throu^i the years hot a point a appui based upon our natural element. 3* It is obvious that the trade to Tehran and the North wmoh is now carried by the railway will never return else- wnere, but on the other hand geography does not change and isianan, Shiraz, Kerman ana Yezd and the area to the^south of them will still find their natural outlet in the ports Kinga.i and bandar Abbas* Their position,^howsser has sadly decayed owing to the iron control'of the L-.l’.S.C* during the war years vihich has routed the restricted imports | via the railway, the strang^e-hold exercised by the Liinistiy |Ox **ax iransport upon shixoping, and the diversion of road transport to the North. The result has been that tfie eccnor/dc liie Oi. uiie douth das peen aliiiost completely undermined. 4. One result of this economic decay has been that a large section of the population has migrated to the Arab side, xit the present moment a number of these find emplov- ment on the aerodrome and in the Oil Companies, but labour wiu.1 very shortly cease to be at a premium in these States, nl and/- ._ . 9 • * • and their continued presence on the ii.rab side is most undesirable. The Persian colony in many of the Sheikhdoms is already embarrassingly large, and any further increase can only serve to bolster up possible Persian claims and t»o provide us with difficulties which we should be wise to avoid. 5. It cannot be toe clearly stated that the absence of indigenous snipping along the Persian littoral is entirely due to ourselves. During the early years of this century the British India ateamsnip Company strangled the carrying of cargo by indigenous crait by strong-arm methods of the most arbitrary kind, and it is clearly equitable that we should now provide this vital means of transport even at some inconvenience to ourselves. I* have taken up this matter separately with the Government of India and enclose a copy of a recent communication to them on this subject. o. To son up T feel that we should exercise every endea vour yto keep the Southern Persian littoral in being as an economic eni-ity and that we should do our utmost to repair tne damage which we have caused partly as a result of the '.mi efiort and partly through a failure to appreciate our real interests, we snould endeavour to secure^a body of prosperous and contented merchants whose interests are bound up with ours, giving them favourable treatment in the matter of export permits from India and the United kingdom; we should stimulate trade with India and the Briuish Bmpire instead of neglecting it and finally we should increase the means d transport to the interior up on which the trade must partly depend.

There is no doubt that questions of this kind.are far better dealt with on the spot, and we will ask.our Representative in India to look into the matter. «Ve have previously suggested that the Political Resident should discuss any shipping difficulties with our Representatives our there, either at Basra or Bombay, and in replying to his caole you might care to repeat the suggestion.

The discontinuance of calls at Koweit on the downward voyage was arranged to save ship’s time, seeing that all commercial requirements appeared to be adequately covered with the assistance of the 'RESANG” as a feeder vessel.

S' fa while he was here he took advantage of the' or) ^ortunity ^ ^ to tell the Persians something'about the conditions 'ifcpjfa- on the } ersian side of the Gulf, of which as a rule V 'i they know nothing. I took him to see the Shah and the Prime Minister, and he was*also able to have talks with Hajhir, now Minister of the interior. Dr. Avery, the American Director of public Health, and Professor Oberling, the Alsatian who was for some time Head of the Medical Faculty here and after an absence of two years in the United States has just returned to take up the same position again. prior was thus able to tell several influential people about conditions along the Persian shore of the Gulf - the flight of many thousands of people to the Arab side of the Gulf and the poverty of those who remain, and to make discreet suggestions for the improvement of conditions whereby many of the emigrants could probably be attracted back, e.g. irrigation, the development of the fishing industry, which began with the erection of a canning factory at Bandar Abbas, and so on. The need for administrative changes was hinted at. At present there is no unity of direction: one official depends on Tehran, another on Shiraz, a third on Ahwaz, and so on; and few of the officials have any local interests, or any other aim than to return to the capitax as soon as possible, bringing tjieir sheaves with them. The Prime Minister received very well the suggestion that the old system presented many advantages, under which the whole of the Persian litoral was under' the Darya Begi^ and promised to consider the re-establishment of tnat systemT Prior will doubtless report on his interviews at / v length but I wished-you to know of the attempt that was made to arouse in Tehran some interest in a neglected part of the Persian dominions.

The reason for this system was to ensure that the acknowledgment in respect of a particular bag was not despatched before its contents reached Buahire.

Dear Peel, I have your letter of 28th Apl?£l with further reference to the question of shipping facilities between India and ports in the Persian Gulf. As the Political Resident has discussed the position with Masson, I feel sure the latter will do all he can with the tonnage at his disposal to provide what is required. To ensure that there is no misunderstanding, however, we will write to him to confirm that our desire is to meet the wishes of the /Government of India?

On a particular voyage fj^^^k^the delay involved will depend on the other ports of fKt call. It is not merely a question of extra steaming, J* because, owing to limited navigational aids, certain I landfalls in this area have to'be made under particular K^clkW^ conditions of light e.g UaIk ^ sl:loul&lt;i remembered R«uA&gt;iuv^. ma y involve missing a tide (or more probably two ev^tides) at the mouth of the Shatt el ArabJ' This is quite apart from the question of fitting in with convoy arrangements, of which we have no details here. We have no wish to enter into a long range discussion on such technical matters, which are best settled on the rfy- spot, but it was felt that the Political Residents cable bvjuT might leave you with the impression that there would be tK«ya*AjL no difficulty at all in agreeing to all ships calling 'touoJliiv &lt;XAA.CVn^o( * f Stvi at or close .'to dawn.

Yours sincerely. (ttfdO R-E.cc.Q. Secretary, The Political Eesicbent 1 s telegram No, T/73 of llarch 1 st arose out of a corrrplaint from us at the delay in receiving Muscat Intelligence Summaries, about which I do not want to bother you. It goes off, however, into a general discussion of shipping facilities in the Persian Gulf, and this aspect is discussed in Mr. Peel*s note belov/. I take it that the ansv/er to the questions at the beginning of that note is that shipping in the Persian Gulf is controlled by the M.v/.T.,in its local aspects through their representatives at Basra and in India; but that the Government of India retains in whole or in part control over Indian registered ships plying to the Gulf. (On the last point, the Jinambo and the Resang mentioned in paragraph 2 of the telegram sound to me like ships of the ocindia Line). It is not clear what the Political Resident means by 'central communication' but possibly he means that he would like the steamers to be routed on a diagonal course so as to serve both sides of the Gulf in the same voyage. They would thus go via e.g. Muscat, Bandar Mbbas, Bahre.in, Bushire, Kowfcit to Basra. ThO reference in paragraph 2 to risk at Jask and Chohbah seems to relate to the recent reports that ,jd.s submarines have appeared in the waters round the mouth of the Gulf. as the telegram is undoubtedly obscure, it would seem best, if we are to circulate copies to other departments here, to do so under cover of a letter to M.W.T. I should be glad of your views on the telegram generally, and in particular on what we could say to M.&lt;(• T• about it. Mr. Lumby. I am afraid that none of us has any precise knowledge of what has been happening to shipping in the Persian Gulf lately, except that, owing partly to the general shipping shortage and mainly to the necessity of providing tonnage for cereal imports /into1 Mi 'M v ,r in isi; : ,.. i v . v * \i . x . k. .^.j. lo x • HTt &amp; f%(S g 1 • ~nG C Jt .i' . iHlaL xsK % AihnI to «t nrjeuxrxwi &lt;*i yAiX» * X hiftt .te I rx into India, there has been considerable pressure to withdraw ships from these services. The Ministry of War Transport representatives at Basra and Bombay would be the best sources of information, but no doubt the Ministry of Viar Transport people here already know a great deal. The Ministry of War Transport themselves control all requisitioned Indian*register ed tonnage (which now covers a large proportion of the whole) and I should expect them to have a fair knowledge of what happens to non-requisitioned tonnage. The latter, of course, is controlled by the Govenanent of India only in the loosest sense. I do not see what more you can say to the Ministry of War Transport than that ^ here is a telegram from the Political Resident and that we should be glad to know (a) what are the facts, and (b) what can be done to ameliorate the position. h U'i: A nT*/'W &lt;fss r • • BECHET ^[7589. ^OE- II-r;ARD TELSGR^ (If In any case the eommunipatilaiPo/ Se cion tents of this document to any person outside Government ^/^y/icje is authorised, it mus£ r jt|]^aphra^ed) o 'in otted to Ext ernal Department Copies girculated* From To CYPHER TELEGRAM flfiSiD5*T Political Kuwait ' Secretary of State for India and Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf for M,/.T.

With reference to your letters of 27th November, PZ.7361/39 and 29th November, PS.7437/39 with enclosures from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about Koweit, I have been in touch with Imperial Airways and have learnt from them that regular calls at Koweit were introduced recently by order of their Manager in Alexandria. This instruction, however, has not met with the approval of the Company here for operational reasons which they wish to investigate further. A call at Kov/eit involves a delay of forty-five minutes, which is liable to lead to night operations at Baghdad. The Company also wish to conserve as far as possible their fuel supplies in the Persian Gulf. I have, hov/ever, arranged with the Company that regular calls will be made in each direction by both their landplane services in the meantime, and that they will notify us in advance of any proposed alteration. I have asked them to try to arrange permanently for at least one service per week in each direction to land at Koweit, for the purpose of picking up and dropping mail. I am writing to Bell, at the Post Office, to-day giving him the above information, and asking him if he can arrange for the despatch of mail to and from Koweit direct.

This convenient arrange ment, however, is only a favour on the part of the 3.1. and is either unknown to, or intentionally overlooked by, the Persian local authorities, who are inclined to be friendly to us. Any increase, however, of the mail thus dealth with by the inclusion of extra packages from the Government of India would, I am afraid, lead to objections on the part of the B.I. and mifeht lead to the Persian authorities raising official objections.

In view of the difficulties mentioned by Bagdad the adoption of the suggestion to send the Bushire mail by air via Basra does not seam feasible. 3. The alternative which su^ests itself is to send the mail (both confidential and non-confidantial, other than secret documents) by air to the Political Agent at Bahrain who would transmit it to Buahire in '&amp;he same manner as he sends his own mil. iuch an arrangement would seem convenient and would result in a considerable saving in time. The Air Mail Service xrom New Delhi to Bahrain takes a day and the steamer from Bahrain to Buehire also takes a day. Dven assuming, that the mail lias to wait a few days at Bahrain in order to catch a suitable steamer, it is considered that the mail would be delivered at Bushire in a shorter time than it would under the existing arrangement. Moreover, if and when the proposal to x shift the Residency to Bahrain raateriaiises, there will be no need to alter the proposed arrangement. At present all urgent postal cons/iuni cat ions intended for Bushirs fire sent to the Political /gent at Bahrain. 4.

Dear Chancery, Will you please refer to your letter No.18/21/38 of the 12th July, 1938, regarding the transmission of our mail to Bushire? 2. It has been ascertained that a land plane carrying mails leaves Delhi on Wednesdays and arrives at Basra on Thursdays and that the weekly slow mail steamer is scheduled to leave Basra for Bushire on Fridays. 3. x In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the best arrangements would be to send our Bushire mail in the personal charge of the pilot of the westbound plane leaving Delhi on Wednesdays for delivery to His Majesty’s Consul, Basra, at the Basra Air Port, if His Majesty’s Consul could make arrangements for taking over the mail bag from the pilot. The mail could then be included in the special bag which is made up at Basra and transmitted to Bushire on Friday by the weekly slow mail steamer. The Political Resident desires that only one bag should be sent from Basra. 4. We have no information as to where the India Office mail for Bushire is delivered and how often, but it would probably be more convenient if the mail for Bushire both from The Chancery, British Embassy, Bagdad.from India and London could be amalgamated and despatched from Basra to Bushire every week, instead of waiting for the mail from Tehran which, as you state, is despatched every fortnight, 5. The arrangement mentioned in paragraph 3 above would effect a considerable saving in time and we should be grateful to know whether His Majesty 1 s Ambassador sees any objection to the suggested procedure and v/hether His Majesty* Consul at Basra would be agreeable to making the necessary arrangements for taking'delivery of our mail bag and sending it on to Bushire as proposed, 6. We are sending a copy of this letter to the India Office and Bushire. Yours ever, External Affairs Department(18/27/38) 2nd December, 1938. Dear Department, Your letter D.O. No. F.60-N/38 of October 12th about the transmission of your mail to Bushire. We have gone into your suggestions very carefully, and the following are our comments, after consulting the Consulate at Basra:- (1) It appears that the slow mail steamer for Bushire is irregular in its departures from Basra and does not invariably sail on Fridays; it sometimes sails on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, or Sundays. Imperial Airways are even more irregular, particularly in v/inter. Consequently there would be a double uncertainty about your mail catching the connexion at Basra. If the bag service to Bushire was weekly, this would not perhaps matter very much, since the bag would only have to wait six or seven days before the next boat. With the present fortnightly service, however, the delay would be considerable and the proposal to send the bag via Basra v/ould not appear an improvement on the existing system. (2) This brings us to the question whether a weekly instead of a fortnightly bag service should be instituted. The India Office (like Tehran Legation) send their mail to External Affairs Department, Government of India, NEW DELHIQo'?'' to Bushire fortnightly. They have in the past suggested that the service should 'be made a weekly one, but they withdrew their proposal in view of the difficulties which 5t raised. ^hese difficulties are as follows The procedure for sending the bag to Bushire is complicated, and moreover, rather delicate owing to the rigidity of the relevant Iranian regulations (which lay down (l) that courier visas for Iran may only be issued by Iran diplomatic missions and not by consulates, and (2) that the courier’s national passport must be produced as well as the courier passport whenever a courier visa is required). So, every time a bag goes to Bushire, the Consulate at Basra have to find out in advance the name and passport details of the certain of the B.I. steamer (the passport itself being on the high seas with the captain). 1^ these details are easily obtainable, the Consulate pass them on to us by post; but often, owing to changes among the 3.1. masters and alterations in the schedule of sailings, a telegram has to be sent. On receipt of this information, we write to the Iranian Legation giving them the details of the courier’s national passport and asking them to be good enough to visa the courier passport (in spite of the absence of the national passport). We then have to sit on the Iranian door-step until the visa is granted, and get the passport down to Basra in time to be handed to the captain before his steamer sails. If there is any delay or the Iranians have a series of holidays, as they are apt to do, it is impossible to get the passport to Basra in time. The procedure for the Consulate at Basra is even more complicated. Not only do they have to keep in touch with the B.I. Company’s agents and Imperial Airways, but they havehave to drive seven miles to the aerodrome to collect the amil for Bushire. This is brough back to the Consulate to be made up in a single bag with anything else that is to hand. The bag is then driven out another seven miles to the B. I. berth and handed to the Captain with the passport. Thus, a round trip of 28 miles has to be made each time. You will see, therefore, that the whole procedure is not only complicated, but expensive. The real snag, however, Is the question of the Iranian visa. We are already asking a good deal of the Iranians in getting them to strain their courier regulations once a fortnight, and an attempt to duplicate the service might result in killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. If, however, you, the India Office and the Foreign Office consider that the political necessity for a weekly bag to Bushire is sufficient to make it worth while running the risk that the Iranian Legation will refuse to play altogether, we and the Consulate at Basra are very willing to undertake the extra trouble involved. It would also have to be considered whether the political necessity, assuming there was one, iustified the additional expense involved. The final decision will have to be taken in London, as we are at present bound by Foreign Office instructions to keep the bag service to Bushire a fortnightly one. We are sending copies of this letter to the Foreign Office, to Bushi re and to Basra. Yours ever, CHANCERY.o (24/37/38) ^IR ^alL. FILE COPY Q1 KO C.» 3 !

I have the honour to state, as per advice received from my Government, that in consequence of the recent alteration in the calls of the Fast Mail Steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited at the Iranian porta the Postal service between Iran and India has been adversely effected. Correspondence between the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, Teheran, and the representatives of the shipping Company at Bushire in the matter resulted in the latter’s suggestion that the shipping Company be remunerated for the carriage of the mails according to their scheduled tariff and this was duly approved by the Iranian Authorities. Subsequently however the said representatives stated that the usual weekly calls of the Fast Mail Steamers at the Iranian ports would be fortnightly and that these steamers would not call at the port of Bunder Abbas. They also stated that the Mails from the Iranian ports were to be carried by an Iranian Postal Official from shore to ship and after the necessary weighments and the payment of the tariff dues in cash the Mails to be handed over on board the ship. I have the honour to sufcmit that the Postal service between Iran and India cannot be efficient unless the Fast Mail Steamers call weekly at the Iranian ports as before otherwise there has always been a service of slow mail steamers. It is therefore requested that due consideration be kindly caused to be given to this important matter and this Consulate be please informed as to the result thereof for communication to my Government.

JSy lord, P z if D i s' I 12ith Hajpch, 1938. .» J I have the honour to refer to Mr* Seymour’s dospatoh ho #35 of the ^jnd February, and connected corre&amp;- pondenoe,regarding the delivery of diplomatic hags to the Political Residency at Bushire. I* bo remembered that in his telegram to His Majesty’s Minister ho •10 of the 12th February,a oooy oX which was sent to the India Office,the Honourable the political Resident in the Persian {julf suggested that in spite of the protest made by the Iranian Grovernaent aeorrtimtfiH regarding the direct delivery of a mail bag to the Resid ency, ti*e present system might be allowed to continue until again challenged. Hia Majesty’s Minister.however,consid ered that it was desirable to regularise the position. According to the Iranian regulations,a courier must present his courier’s passport to the Customs. Under the existing arrangement this is impossible,because the captain of the ship who holds the courier’s passport for the bag addressed to the Consulate-General,does not go ashore. Mr. Seymour therefore suggested to sir Trenchard Fowle that this difficulty might be surmounted if the courier’s passport were in future made out in the nam^of the Bushire agent of Messrs Gray.Mackenzie and company,who is actually responsible for bringing the bag through the Bushire customs. He added that if this were done,it seemed unnecessary to furnish the Captain of the ship with a courier’s passport visa’d by the Iranian authorities, /since, The Right Honourable, Ihe Viscount Halifax K. G. ,G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc.,-2 k&gt; Eince,during the whole time that he was in ciuurge of the hag u til his arrival at 3u3hire,he is either at an Iraqi port or else on the high seaa. o. I have now been informed by Sir Trenchard Fowle that he considers that it would be quite feasible to issue the courier’s passport in the name of Gray Mackenzie’s agent,and that the agent,'£r« v* Gregor,has very kindly agreed to act as courier. Sir Trenchard Fowle concurs in the view expressed by His Majesty’s Minister that if this arrangement is adopted,it will not be necessary for the Captain of the ship to hold a courier’s passport. I am therefore arranging with His Majesty’s Embassy at Baghdad that,provided no objection is seen,the suggested new arrangement should be adopted forthwith. it the request of Sir Trenchard Fowle,I am also suggesting that the bags should in future be sent from Basra to Bushire by the weekly slow mail,instead of by the c mow fortnightly fast mail. The bag service to Bushire will remain a fortnightly one,but delays due to the bag being held up for the fast mail should now be avoided. 5* It will be observed from 3ir Trenchard Fowle’s telegram to His :aje3ty»s Minister ho.lG of the 12th February,that no courier passports are at present used for confidential correspondence from India to Bushire. The enclosures to Sir John himon’s despatch Ho.579 of the 28th Hovember,1934,(y.1019/22/650),show that the introduction of courier passports for such correapcj&amp;enee was contem plated at that time. X do not know why the arrangement was never adopted,arid I am of the opinion that it is desirable that confidential correspondence from India should be brought in under a courier’s passport rather /titanthan sent,as at present,throu«#i the Iranian post office, occasionally even remaining in the post office overnight 6. I have therefore requested Sir Trenchard Fowle, if ho soes no objection,to arrange with the Government of India that their confidential correspondence should he sent to him under an arrangement similar to that adopted for the hags frora Ba$idad. The hag would then he sent to Buohire in charge of the Captain of the ship,with a courier*s passport in the name of the Bnshire agent, visa*d hy the Iranian Consul-General at Delhi or Simla. 7. ::eanwhile,I am replying to the Irwiian Govorn- ment’a note of the 20th January in the note of v/hieh I have the honour to enclose a copy herein. 8.

After carreapoadence with Minister, Tehran, a sat isfactory arrangement has come to by which Gray Mackenzie's agent at Bushire has been asKed whether he would act as courier between the ship and shore for mails combing froa Basra and beyond. Gray Mackenzie's agent, MSf. W.Oregor, was agreeable to do this, and Legation, Tehran, are arranging with Bagdad for his name to be entered on the courier's passport. At present bags from Basra cane by fast mail which only call at Bushire fort- nightly. in future bags will be sent from Basra by the weekly slow mail. 3 * finister, Tehran, points out that couriers' passports are not used for bags from India, that this was con templated by Government of India(A(&lt;)R4d»«^r.Caroe&lt;, letter to dr.

(The fortnightly fast mail steamers of course no longer carry maile). it ieould be poeeible for .-sir. Ur eg or* s name to be entered as the courier for the Indian bags as well as for the bags fraa Basra but, as he has pointed out in tne course of conversation, tnis would entail his visiting every down slow mail and every up mail - slow or fast. ?hl« he ob.erre,, not unnaturally, would be a considerable call on his time. 8 ' - ai 1 °‘‘ n •J*««8t la for Goverrun*nt of India to send **U for luahire by the alow mail only, and for th.m to arrange that one of the amp* a offioora &amp;. given a courier's passport and that he ooaea ashore with the bag at % shire.

The packet is despatched from the India Office under cover to the Consul at Basra 'who forwards it by sea mail to Bushire under the courier system, the Legation at Bagdad obtaining from the Persian Legation a courier’s vi£a for the Captain of the steamer. This system is safe but it appears at present to take about three weeks from it IS t&amp;jaJt the India Office to Bushire. -Wo era 01.1 me that^confidential matter from Bushire addressed to the India Office is similarly sent under the courier system, a courier’s vi^a being obtained from the Persian li k gntlwii- at Bushire. The air mail from Bushire also appears to take about three weeks to reach this Office. Bo one has yet explained satisfactorily the reason for the long delay under these arrangements, especially as regards the inward mail from Bushire. We had previously understood that the delay in the outward service was due to the difficulty of obtaining a Persian viya from the Persian Legation at Bagdad, but Sir Francis Humphrys, in his despatch of 17th December, paragraph 2, says that no undue difficulty is now encountered over vixas. The demi official letter of 15th December from the Tehran Legation suggests that under present arrangements our confidential air mail to Bushire should take 8 days and in Mr. Laithwaite's d.o.letter c^f 9th February, 1934 (P.Z.954/34) to Colonel Fowle we suggested a period of 10 days, or at the very most 17 days, assuming that the mail is held up for a week owing to the difficulty of obtaining vixas. If the present system can be speeded up it is obviously the best and most direct and also safe for confidential matter, but it may not be possible to obtain more than the present fortnightly service by this route as at present. (b)/(b) via Karachi . Aaalternative scheme 'which has been suggested is that conlidential air mail matter for Bushire might be sent to Karachi and thence by sea mail back to Bushire. Under this scheme mails would take about 11 days between this Office and Bushire. The present sea mail arrangements between Karachi and Bushire seem to be fairly safe, see paragraph 3 of Colonel Bowie's letter of 27th November last (P.Z.7973/34), but to avoid any possible insecurity on this part of the route we should have to introduce a courier system from Karachi to Bushire. This would be subject to the difficulties mentioned below under (2). If our object is to have a weekly confidential air mail to Bushire and if the service under the present arraiigemefe »^^to ^ take less than 11 days^a possible course might be to continue the present fortnightly service via Basra adopting the Karachi scheme for every alternate week. If (c) by Dutch Aeroplane? 1 ^ As regards non-confidential matter we sometimes make use at present of the ordinary air mail postal service to Bushire wnich is routed by the G.P.O. by Imperial Airways via Basra o^i utaii takes 8 or 9 days to reach Bushire. I understand, however, from informal conversation with that if we put up a reasoned official proposal ^they probably be quite willing to accept registered air mail packets from this Office for transmission to Bushire by the Dutch air mail which would provide a much swifter means of communication. (2) Sea Mail . Under present arrangements the sea mail to Bushire is of more concern to the Government of India than to this Office, since our sea mail to Bushire is very small. We would, however, be directly interested in this service if we adopted the Karachi scheme/3. ✓ ^ J . -&lt; - &gt; ' scheme for our confidential air mail. It seems from paragraph 3 of Colonel Fowle's letter of 27th November (P.Z.7973/34) that the present service is reasonably secure, mails from Karachi practically never having to lie in the Persian Post Office overnight as the mail steamer normally arrives in the forenoon. Complete security on this route might be obtained by the adoption of a courier system, but such a system is open to,possible difficulties as regards quarantine mentioned by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 6 of his letter and it also appears that as regards Consular mails the Persian regulations limit the amount of mail carried by each courier to 2 kilograms (P.Z.6129/31) though this might not apply to the Government of India’s mail to Bushire. 0n-the-j£hol p. it, mrur h^ rona-LriarariAca-fni?turb tho- cak, j/~ s '***+-£. unfitly 2 Ccrv&gt;tCe)t SjS'ti** j(\_ -wouutf UK. t-K, U&amp;jLcd L ^~ r^JU j£w&gt;t ^ ^ T*i_ T* aJyKiJ^ cCti ^ od£ Pz . 7 / 7^/^J(Tt/Xft/M) iAPitifth tim&amp;QAd* 17th ixmoittoar, 81r p 2 hav« r®*a th« oorro«ponaenc« efteloftad in your fianpntch l*o.

Confidential. Decemher 15th, 1934, Dear Eastwood, Most of the questions raised in your despatch No.579 of Novemher 28th concern Bushire far more closely than us hut we take it that you want our advice as to whether the arrangements proposed will run counter to the Persian regulations. There are three hags to Bushire to he considered (a) from London (h) from India (c) from Tehran. (a) As you know the present arrangement is that the Bushire hag is enclosed in the Baghdad hag and sent from there to Basrah where it is handed to the Captain of the B.I. fast mail who drops it at Bushire. We cannot under stand how this can take two or three weeks as stated in Laithwaite*s letter to Loch PZ4876/34 of August 3rd. Moreover when the new Impair service comes into operation, which we gather it will shortly, the service could he accelerated. The hag would leave London hy air on Saturday, reach Baghdad on Tuesday and Basrah on Wednesday or Thursday. It would leave there on. Saturday and reach Bushire hy fast mail as at present on Sunday. Total eight days, thus saving three days on the proposed method of flying the hag to Karachi and sending it hack. (h) The Indian hag. The Persian Consul-General at Delhi is empowered to grant couriers visas and no mention need henade of the name of the courier. A form can therefore he filled out for the Captain of the fast mail leaving Karachi on Sunday and reaching Bushirecn Wednesday* (c) The Tehran hag. We find that present arrangement whereby our hag goes to Baghdad and is there made up hy the Embassy and sent on with the London hag, is perfectly satisfactory. We should he very reluctant that our mail to Bushire should he put on hoard an aeroplane at Baghdad, sent to Karachi and then returned to Busnire. The time lag with Busnire is serious, anyhow, and we don f t want to do anything to increase it. But apart from this consideration it seems to us that the question is really one for Bushire to settle. You will no doubt he replying to the question of using/ H. E. Eastwood Esquire, Foreign Office, S.W.lusing the K.L.M, which lies outside our province. The Dutch pilot could perhaps he given a couriers passport hut this procedure is cumhersome. If the latter was sent hy ordinary air mail it would have to pass through the Persian Post Office. It could thus only he used for urgent non-confidential stuff. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Peter Loxleymam Confidential j D.O.N 0 .IIO 6 -S of 1934 The Residency, Bushire, 27th November 1934. Please refer to correspondence ending with your demi-official letter No.P.Z.6617/34, dated the 6 th October 1934, to Caroe, on the subject of mail arrangements at Bushire. 2. Previous to Loch’s demi-official letter No.872-S dated the 7th September 1934, I had informed the India Office that mails had sometimes to remain in the Persian Post Office overnight (vide paragraph 7 of my demi-official letter No. 958-S, dated the 27th December 1932 to Walton). For ready reference and also for the information of the Government of India, to whom my letter was not sent (though copies were sent to Tehran and Baghdad) as we were dealing at that time with the question of oags from London, I enclose copies of that paragraph as well as of the preceding one. 3. From these paragraphs you will see that it is only the bags from the down fast mail, i.e. from Basrah, which occasionally lie in the Persian Post Office overnight. The mails arriving by the up fast mail from Karachi have practically never to lie in the Persian Post Office overnight as the mail arrives in the forenoon. 4. So much for inward mails. hs regards outward mails. Except in the winter months, the down fast mail to India arrives by noon on Sundays, and the post does not lie over night in the Persian Post Office. During the winter months, however, / J.G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, London 0- 2 - however, the mail occasionally arrives on a Monday morning, the post is closed on the previous day and has, perforce, to lie overnight in the Persian Post Office. The post for the up and down slow mails is generally closed on the day previous to the arrival of the mail steamer and our letters for all posts in the Gulf have, therefore, to lie overnight in the Persian Post Office. 5. Recently, owing to quarantine difficulties we have had no option but to send our sealed bag to Baghdad through the post instead of by courier• The bag however is sent by the up last mail to Basrah the mails for which, as pointed out in paragraph 3 above, do not lie overnight in the Persian Post Office, and the bag is posted just before the mail is closed and handed over to the B.I.Agents. 6 . In his letter No*F.ll-N/31 of 6 th October, Caroe suggests that we should have recourse to the courier system for the despatch of mails from India to Bushire with the Captains of the B.I. vessels as couriers. The difficulties of working the courier system by sea are of course greater than they were by air. While the Govern ment of India can doubtless get over the difficulty of entering- on the courier^ passport the name of a particular B.I.Captain and the number of his passport (required under the Regulations), the system might break down when the up fast mail, i.e. from Karachi, is in quarantine as our representative would not be allowed to board the vessel and, in view of the severity with which quarantine regulations are locally imposed, may not even be permitted to take delivery of the bag overside in the way that the Persian mail clerk of the local B.I.Agent is permitted to take over the postal mails. The fast mail moreover is more often than not in quarantine on its arrival at Bushire: it has been /-3- been so for the last 10 months. I think, tnerefore, that it is preferable to continue the system of sealed bags through tne post* Secret matter, would, of course, have to be sent to Bahrain under the arrangements described in paragraph 2 of Loch f s aemi-olticial letter No.872-S, dated the 7th September 1934 to you (copy to Metcalfe under No.878-S of same date). I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe.Extract paragraphs 6 and 7 of demi-official letter Fo.958-S of 27th December 1932 from the Hon f ble Lieut•- Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.L.political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to J.C.V/alton Lsquire,C.B. ,M.C. ,The India Office, London• x X X X X XX 6 . The whole crux, however, of the situation is that letters have to pass through the Persian post here - inward and outward - no matter by what route they arrive unless carried by courier. Last March to obviate this difficulty, we made an arrangement with 'Mespers' (Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, a British concern), the British India Steam Naviga tion Company Agents, who collect the mails from the ships, which resulted in the mails not having’ to lie in the Persian post office overnight either outward or inward. (The mails arriving by Airways were of course quite simple as the pilots were couriers and received and handed over mails at the aerodrome from and to a Residency representative, v/ith the transfer of the route to the Arabian side this safe channel of safe communication ceased to function). 7. Now, however, owing to the shortening of daylight during the winter, our arrangement for the delivery of the inward mails from Iraq has fallen through, for on two occasions the mail steamer from Basrah arrived late in the evening and the mails reached the shore well after dark. As the Persian post office will not sort and deliver mails after dark the whole mail was locked up in the post office overnight and dealt with the next morning.

My dear Laithwaite, I have sent copies of your letter P.Z. 6517/34 of November 20th to Tehran and Bagdad with a request for their comments. I will let you have these when I receive them. In the meantime with regard to paragraph 3 of your letter so far as I am aware we do not make use of the Dutch air mail even for non-confidential matter. Our practice is, if we wish to send non-confidential matter by air mail, to hand it over to the General Post Office to route as they think fit. I suspect that they route air mail for Bushire by Imperial Airways; their air mail pamphlet gives 8 or 9 days as the time of transmission. Do you not think that this is a question which you might take up with the General Post Office? In the case of confidential matter your suggestion is, I assume, that the pilot should carry the mail throughout and that it should not pass through postal J.G. Laithwaite, Esq channels./channels. Yon will remember that when we used the Imperial Airways services to India for our confidential bags we had to obtain a special grant of immunity from the countries through which the mail passed. I have not obtained the opinion of the legal and treaty experts here, but at first sight I doubt whether we should be able to ask for special facilities for a foreign pilot. On general grounds I think that we should be very reluctant to do so. The idea of confidential documents being carried by other than reliable British hands is one which for our part we should not contemplate. We do of course make a considerable use of the registered post for non- confidential matter, and I have no doubt that it is generally very reliable. Would not a registered air mail packet to Bushire, if the General Post Office would route it by Dutch line, give speed and sufficient security for the type of document, which you would be prepared to entrust to foreign hands/CONFIDENTIAL. P.Z.4634/35. EXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT ON PERSIA, 1934. Consular Affairs. Mails. 203* During the year the courier system between Bagdad and Bushire worked smoothly, though considerable labour was thrown on His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad and His Majesty’s consul at Basra, on whom fell the onus of obtaining the necessary visas and handing the mail to the captains of the British India Fast Mail. At the end of the year a scheme for a weekly service (the present one is fortnightly) was under discussion. This was to be run in connexion with the new Imperial Airways service. no decision has been reached by the end of the year. 20U» During most of the year mails to His Majesty’s consulates in East Persia reached Tehran in the bag and were sent on to Meshed by special courier. This method obviously resulted in much time being lost, and in September a dummy run was staged, a courier bringing mail from Quetta to Zahedan. The trial succeeded, but difficulties were raised by the Governor of Zahedan, who felt unable to give a courier’s visa to a messenger delivering mail to the Foreign and Political Department, on the ground that he was only allowed by the regulations to give visas to couriers carrying mail to Ministries for Foreign Affairs. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that the Foreign and Political Department were, in fact, the 'Ministry for Foreign Affairs' of the Government of India, and were requested to authorise the Governor to grant// - 2 - grant visas. No reply had. heen received to this note by the end of the year.P.2.6517/34. _ I INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 20th November 1934, r« &gt;Ky C(X^ ~ / ’/ould you please refer to our printed letter No,P.Z.6143/34 of 5th October with which we sent you copies of correspondence with the Resident about the arrangements for the despatch of T 'saxe hand” documents for Consular posts in the Persian Gull.

Eastwood, Esq., FOREIGN OFFICE, S.Y/.l.2 . the possibility of adopting the Persian courier system for sending their confidential mails to Bushina. We are still awaiting the vio-v, r s of the Resident, but meanwhile we should be grateful if you would let us have any comments the Foreign Office may feel able to make on this suggestion on which they may think it well to consult the Minister. We understand that the Embassy at Bagdad have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining couriers’ visas from the Persians in Iraq, but it is possible that the difficulties in obtaining visas from the Persian Consul General in India might be less great and from the enclosure to our printed letter No.P.2.6720/34 of 1st November you will see that while difficulties were raised by the local authorities on the Zahidan route, these have, at any rate temporarily, been successfully overcome. We are not very clear whether, in the event of the courier system being adopted, it would also be necessary to obtain visas from the Persian Governor at Bushire for the outw r ard mail, or whether it would still be possible to continue the unofficial arrangements in this respect which seem to function satisfactorily. 3. We should also like to consult you again on the possibility/3 possibility of using the Dutch air mail, 'making the pilot the official courier, for mails (whether confidential or non-confidential) between this Office, Bushire and India, and between India and Bushire. Prima facie the suggestion is attractive but you will remember that when we discussed the matter informally with you a short time ago the Foreign Office saw objection to it. v !q understand, however, that the Foreign Office themselves occasionally make use of the Dutch air mail for correspondence with Bagdad, though we assume that it is only used for non-conf idential matter. Y&lt; r e should be grateful if you could let us know whether on further consideration thu Foreign Office think the objections to the employment of the Dutch mail (a) for confidential matter, the pilot being made the official courier, (b) for non-confidential matter which need not be entrusted to an official courier, and could be sent through the air mail as an ordinary postal packet are decisive: and, if so, if you would let us know whether those objections are bas^d on a general objection of principle to/4. to allowing a foreign air service to carry official mails, (whether confidential or non-confidential) or on the difficulty to he anticipated with the Dutch and/or the Persians in arranging (in the case of confidential mail) that the pilot should he the official courier, or on the absence of security (which would, of course, he a material point in the case of confidential matter only). 4. We should, of course, he very averse from making any change in existing sea mail arrangements if there was any risk that the result of raising the question with the Persians might he that we should lose the benefit of the present informal arrangements in the Gulf without necessarily obtaining any understanding from them of a dependable nature as to the maintenance of a regular courier service with our Persian posts. On the other hand in the case of the sea mail there appears to he at present an element of insecurity at Bushire: in the case of the air mail the delays to which our confidential air mail service is subject under the present arrangements are very serious, and if the Foreign Office and the Minister think that/3* * 5. that anything can safely be done to improve matters as regards both or either on the lines discussed earl in this letter, we should welcome it.

Vice Consul 2 ahida a dummy run of consular mail ha S s was staged between Zahidan' and Siela. a visa was obtained from the Persian Consul Senoral to India for the outward hag, which reached Zahiaan safely, hut the Persian Governor, at first, refused to visa toe Courier Pass at Zahidan for the inward hag for Inaia on toe ground that articles 1 and 2 of the Persian Couriers' Hegulation. only permit of hags being addressed to the foreign Ministry of the country «&gt;ncerned, and therefore th? no hag could he addressed except to the Poreign Office, London. He has, however, since agreed, after consulting Tehran, to waive his objection for the time being. We are anxious that this method of despatch of confidential mails for Zahidan, Zabul, and Meshed should he put on a proper footing since the present temporary arrange ment of sending them by air to Baghaad and thenoe to Tehran results to unavoidable delay. It i. possible that Persian acquiescence will not continue, and, if this fear is realised, we hope that His Majesty's Minister will he able to invite the Persian Government's attention to the second paragraph of Article 1 of the Persian Couriers* Heguiations, 1 ac co rding tHCLObUHV ' Y » s ,».»««»»„ No NO Uttor * \ OQT. $ wee 1 1 lifted 290^. 1934according to whicn our Consular Offio^ra In Persia and Persian Consular Officers In India have x&amp;e right on grounds of j eoiprooitjr i*o send and receive official bags by courier. There is noiiiiing to state that* such bags must be sent to the foreign Virile try of the country concerned. The fact that Uiis paragraph was a deflni&amp;e adaenuuja, oommunioated after the issue of the Regulations f seems to carry the implication that the Consuls of either country may send official bags by courier, irrespective of the point whether they are being sent to the foreign Ministry of the country to which they were addressed. The couriers employed are from the Chagai hevy escort and it is proposed to despatch mails from ana to iSahiaan fortnightly. This disposes of the suggestion to send confidential packets by the hand of the drivers of the postal lorries between Nok Kundi and 3fcirjawa, which the Croverniuent of India thought to be open to serious objection.

His Majesty's Government having intimated their readiness to give reciprocal facilities to Persian consular officers in the British Entire. we can therefore have recourse to the courier system for the despatch of our confidential mails to Bushire. The Persian Consul General in India is authorised to visa couriers' passports on such official mails from this end. as we have the right to send a courier mail to Bushire and so avoid the Persian Post Office, we are inclined to think that it would be well to exercise it and so eliminate all risk. Arrangements might be made to make• *r make the Captain of the B.I.

Negotiations would of course be necessary and some expense would be involved, but there seems no reason why this service should not be trustworthy and In any case far more reliable than the present system which permits of most confidential documents being left in the Persian Post Office. 3 , I am sending a copy of this letter to Loch.

(19/9) 16-5-33 Sir I have the honour to refer to your telegram No .7 of 12th Farch and to state that the difficulties with which we shall have to contend if the full reciuirements of the Oourier [Regulations he insisted upon, are outlined in my despatch Mo. 27 of 29th Farch 1932. The system at present is as follows:- (a) ZAHIDAN-FBSHAD ROUTB. One courier carries the weeicl/ hag to SirJand where he hands over the outgoing hag from Feshad and receives the incoming oag from a second courier who has come from Zahidan. (h) ZAHIDAN-ZABUL CAFEL CONBIBRS. Pour men work in sections handing over to each other at the end of sections. One man cannot perform in the through journey and lorries cannot he made use of , as they are very irregular and the road is frequently impassable. (c) ZAHIDA^-BALTICHISTAN KROmSB (mxrjata). A courier carries the outgoing hag from Zahidan to ?r irjawa where he hands over to a Levy 'Jorps man of the Baluchistan Administration and receives from him the incoming hag. On route (a) On route ( 0 ) the men employed are local Baluchis. Either the present men or their fathers have been so employed ever since the donsulate was established. ritish subjects with the necessary camels and knowledge ol the country, could not he fohnd. I oreover the route, in spite of anything the Persians may say to the contrary, is dangerous and subject to raids. It is only the(&amp; the fact that we regular/ employ men from the leading tribes along the route that has secured for our mail, and for British travellers on this road, immunity from highway robbery. Any British travellers held up on the road by bad weather or other difficulties are invariably assisted and protected by these tribesmen and ^heir relatives. This does not apply to Persians who are frequently robbed and no small number of murders have occurred. nder the existing regulations visas would have to be obtained as followss- ? r eshad Bahidan route - 4 visas weekly. Babul-Zahidan route - 8 visas weekly. The Zahidan-Tirjawa route would be ^uite unworkable. The regulations do not permit of a ’Be turn* visa being issued, while a visa for the Journey to Kirjawa could be got from the local Governor at Zahidan, there is no official at 7 'irjawa who could issue a visa for the return journey with the incoming bag. This would necessitate the employment of regular couriers travelling over the whole route to Quetta, where a visa could be obtained from the Persian Passport Officer for the journey irom Inaia to Persia. It would seem thac the f.egulations were originally framed for couriers crossing the frontiers. T ,7e have no such couriers. As far as I can judge the only real objection the Persians have to our inter-Oonsulate couriers is that they thereby lose the revenue from postage on letters. Actually we expend in Persia far more than would be the postage on letters carried. It occurs to me that the Persians might be induced tc relax the regulations in the case of inter-Consulate couriers/couriers in 3ast Persia, provided we offer to ica^ce good the actual loss on postage. This might he achieved in one of two ways - either we agree to pay a fee for visas, which would compensate for loss of postage. This would he the simpler method for us - or we under take to stamp all letters between Consulates and produce the letters for cancellation at the local Post-Office, before inclusion in the hag. This would apply to inter-consulate correspondence only, since correspondance included in the special hags to and Irom India is already paid for, the hags being weighed at Zahidanand paid for at foreign letter-rate. The conditions to which I suggest we should endeavour to obtain agreement are therefcre- (1) To the issue of six-monthly visas for couriers permitting them to carry a weekly hag, in both directions, between specified points. To obtain the \ number of visas necessary under the present regula tions would be an intoleraole nuisance both to our selves and the local authorities and serves no possible useful purpose. (2) Agreement to the continued employment by us of Persian subjects on the Zahidan-Zabul route. (3) The weight of the bag between Consulates to be not exceeding 30 lilos (as permissible by agreement Linder the present regulations) - Our local mail is frequently heavy. (4) If it be necessary, in order to obtain agreement tc the above, we night offer to pay a fee for visas which would compensate for loss of postage on local correspondence, or, alternatively, to stamp such correspondence. The fee would obviate the necessityof producing the mail at the Post Office, which -particularly at ! r eshad - I consider to he undesirable4, A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the foreign and Political Department.

P.Z.689/32 P.Z.4764/32 SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE 25 Nov.1932 Previous Papers 4475b 1000 5.30 Since August 1931 the Persian and Indian postal authorities have been carrying on a desultory controversy regarding the functions of the Indian Exchange Post Office at Mirjawa. The Persians contend that its functions should be limited solely to the exchange with the Persian Exchange Post Office of closed mails made up by Indian post offices for Persia and by Persian post offices for India, and that these bags should not be opened and sorted in the Indian Exchange Post Office. On the other hand the Indian postal authorities reply that in making up closed mails from articles received from various Indian Offices they are acting in accordance with/I with International Postal Regulations, The controversy has now come to a head, and the Director General, Indian Posts and Telegraphs proposes to inform the Persians that, if the functions of the Mirjawa Office are restricted in the manner they propose, it will not serve any useful purpose- as far as India is concerned and will be closed down, unless they agree to its exercising the normal functions- of an exchange office. In the event of the Mirjawa office being abolished, mails between India and East Persia would have to be sent by sea via Karachi. Before taking this step, however, the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department) are consulting H.M.Consul, Sistan, to see whether in the event of the Mirjawa Office being closed down it would be possible to make satisfactory arrangements for the conveyance of Consular mail bags, which at present pass through the Indian Exchange Office, under the courier system. The present arrangements for the carriage of consular mail bags between India (Nok-Kundi) and Zahidan (Duzdap) are described in paras. 5 and 6 of a letter from the A.G.G., Baluchistan of 18th December last (copy of relevant paras, attached), and the restrictions proposed by the Persian postal authorites would appear to involve Persian interference with these mail© which are carried in the same bags as other registered matter as far as Mirjawa. Between Zahidan, Sistan and Meshed they are conveyed under a private system arranged by the Consuls themselves. With regard to the 'courier system' referred to in the Government of India*s letter of 3rd October m f (Flag J) X it is quite robable that the ersians are really trying to embarrass us in this respect. please/Minute Paper, Department. /*&lt; please see the minute on the attached file (P.Z # 4769/32). There appear to be strong objections to the introduction of this system as between the j consulates in ^ast Persia, and the present unofficial system is much better (vide the letter from the Consul, Sistan, of 29th March - P.Z.3037/32 in the attached file), but in the event of the Mirjawa office being closed down it is just possible that satisfactory arrangements might be made with the Persians for a courier between Zahidan and Quetta without disturbing the present system as between the consula.tes.

(SD.) G.E.CROMBIE. 3.11.32. The Persian attitude appears to be quite inconsistent. In the first place they maintain that this case is notgoverned by Article 2 of the Detailed Regulations attached to the Postal Convention, the first sentence of which says that the exchange of correspondence in closed mails is regulated by mutual consent between the Administrations concerned; on the ; other hand they propose to regard Mirjawa as an intermediate exchange office as provided for in the second part of para. 1 of that Article. Quite rightly the Government of India refuse to agree to this latter suggestion on the ground that the intermediate exchange offices/ E.&amp; 0.7626/32 40110 3 32offices for which the Regulations provide are exchange offices situated in the territory of a third State between the territories of two other States and not, # as in the case of Mirjawa, offices of one State in the territory of another - for which, in fact, neither the Convention nor.the Regulations appears to provide. Apparently, however, the Persians are free to object to the present arrangements as regards closed mails, and unless the Government of India can come to terms with them some other way of dealing with Consular mails will have to be found.

As advised in my telegram No.l4(No.ll7 to India) I have not taken any steps in the matter locally because the matter has not yet been brought up by the local authorities, ana there are a number of points which will be difficult and vexatious to deal with. e.g. 1. Our mails from India are not carried across the frontier by a Courier. They are accompanied from Railhead to Mirjawa by a 'Levy' who starts from Kundi, and are handed over at Mirjawa to a Courier from Zahidan who has accompanied the 'Outward* mail from there. Under the Regulations the Mirjawa - Zahidan Courier could not obtain a Courier 'Visa* for the return from Mirjawa to Zahidan, as there is no official at Mirjawa competent to issue it. We might be able to overcome the difficulty by getting a separate Visa at Zahidan for the return journey. 2. Our Postal Sowars between Sistan and Zahidan, and Birjand and Zahidan in summer, are all Persian subjects, Baluchis who have been employed since the Consulate started. They are, under present regulations not to be employed. Moreover, no one man prefers the whole journey, but they hand over to each other at the end of definite stages* and a number of Visas would be required for each journey. Is there any possibility of the Persians ultimately agreeing to the issue of, say, a six monthly visa to a [ INDIA F™'Mi!Hf^ 6ularly for such purposes? Letter No pis between Consulates often exceed the weight laid i*neri [5MAY. Jy e could, of course, make up a number of bags,but Received 23 MAY. ^5^ it-involves a good deal of extra labour. 44 More often than not, in the case of a regular service such as we have, there^ will he great delay in getting visas and the post will he missed. 5. If we have to employ a •through* Courier between Zahidan and Q,uetta, in order that a visa can he obtained at each place for each journey, the expense will he greatly increased, as several men would he necessary, and on each occasion an ordinary visa would presumably have to he paid for. In view of the difficulties explained above, it seems preferable that we should carry on, as long as possible, with the present arrangements. It is not impossible that the local authorities will allow the arrangement to continue. Should however, the matter again come to a head, I would suggest if possible, that agreement be obtained on the following points, as regards East Persia. 1. That Persian subjects employed for many years past be allowed to continue to carry our bags. It is a source of income to Persia. 2. That such regular employees be granted a six monthly visa to cover journeys between specific points. 3. In the event of a special courier being used at any time a visa for the specific journey would be obtained. 4. That if possible the weight of bags between Consulates within the country might be increased to say 10 Kilos. It is difficult to see what advantage is obtained by forcing us to make up 5 bags of 2 kilos, instead of one large bag, no customs check is involved in such A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department under indorsement No.H8 dated the 29-3-32.(Copy to Inaia Office &amp; Tehran) -S Copy of a memorandum No.183-3 of 1932, dated the'29th March 1932, from the Hon’hle the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Se&amp;retary to the Govern ment of India, New Delhi. i 1 CONSULAB BA.G8 . | &gt;J ' ' ' i ?

In this connexion I now enclose for your information and guidance : (a) A copy of a Circular Memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, No. 15416/S.50 of 2nd September 1930, embodying the Persian Diplomatic Courier Regulations. (Note; Subsequent amendments thereto hare been inserted by this Legation). (b) A copy of a 'Courier^ Passport’ 1 as used by this Legation. (o) A translation of a specimen visa as given to the 'Courier's Passport' by the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a visa similar in form to which Oovernors- General and Governors may be expected to adopt. I consider the best plan is for you to work out details for operating a consular bag service in conjunction with those offices with which you regularly correspond, whether Government of India, Baghdad, other Consular posts or this Legation, bearing in mind of course that the bags are primarily for the transmission of secret correspondence. You will also realise that it is not intended that a service of regular, paid couriers should be instituted between all Consular posts, the object being, mainly (1) to regularise the practice, hitherto followed, of transmitting confidential correspondence from this Legation to Consulates or from one Consulate to another by hand of British travellers, His Majesty's Consular Officer ( 2 ) Ahwaz, Bander Abbas, Bushire, Zahidan (Duzdap), Hamadan, Isfahan, Kerman, Ke mans hah, Meshed, Mohammerah, Resht, Shiraz, Zabul (sistan), Sultanabad, Tabriz.2 - (2) to place on a more secure footing the present service operating on the Meshed-Sistan-Puzdap route, if any regularisation of the present system is thought advantageous. (3) to enable correspondence to and from Consular officers in the Gulf to be carried by British subjects, such as Captains of ships, or Imperial Airways pilots between Baghdad, Basra and India. (4) to permit the couriers travelling between Bagdad and Tehran to deliver bags to the Consulates at Kennanshah and Hamadan. It might be as well for you to discuss the matter with the local Persian authorities before making any plans, in case they may not have been informed of the arrangement by the Central authorities. 4. I also enclose a rough plan of the routes I imagine are likely to be followed, which may serve as a general guide. I shall be glad if you will let me know, in due course, what arrangements you have been able to make.

Farrukh Khan states that instructions have been sent to the Persian Legation at Baghdad to visa Couriers 1 passports for bags 'sent by the High Commission to the Consulate at Kermanshah'. When it was pointed out to him that Kermanshah was only one of many Consulates to which the High Commission might wish to send bags he said that the instructions had been framed in such a way that the Persian Legation at Baghdad would be able to visa 'couriers' passports' for Bushire, Hamadan, and any other Consular post. Farrukh Khan went on to say that the Persian Government, owing to some obscure regulation of their own, could not give similar authority to their Consul at Basrah; the only Persian Consular Officer who was empowered to visa couriers 1 passports being the Consul-General at Delhi. He added that if any difficulties arose we were to let him know. As it stands the system we have evolved is certainly neither water-tight nor fool-proof but it is the best we can do at the moment and it seems to us that the only way of ascertaining its defects is to put it to the test as soon es possible. Ae Communications Department, The Foreign Office.We are accordingly sending copies of this letter to the Government of India, (No. 65); Ba ghdad (No. 32); all Consuls in Persia (Circular No. IB); and to Basrah (No.8) for information; and we suggest that all concerned should let us know if they encounter difficulties. India, for instance, will no doubt tell us if it proves inconvenient in practice that the Consul-General at Delhi only, and not the Consul at Karachi, should be able to visa ,, courier6 , passports”. We do not know whether you or the authorities in India will think it worth while placing the same restrictions on, and exacting the same formalities for, bags received by the Persian Legation and Consulates in British territory as they place upon and exact for our bags. Possibly they do not send enough bags to make them feel any inconvenience from such measures. Yours ever, Chancery. r 1 \ V sa &lt; / Confid en tial. No.S'.11-11/31. Frcir * •—2 COPY 7Q7Q ■ l .

To avoid delay, the letter in the present case was enclosed in a sealed bag registered under Bombay Karachi Sea Post Office Ho. 65 dated the 30 th October 1931 and was forwarded to destination as a special case. As it is likely that complaints would be received from the Persian Post Office if the prescribed limit of weight is exceeded, I beg to suggest that you will kindly request the India Office, London to issue instructions that articles addressed to British Consuls in the Persian Gulf should weigh less than 2 kilos.

Addressed rWI BY Rptd LPT KR and Post BY and Karachi.With reference to Isr. Parr's despatch No* 542 of November 5th 1930 and previous correspondence regarding the courier regulations recently issued by the Persian Government, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a supplementary circular memorandum now received from the Ministry for Foreign Affaire, in which it is stated that subject to reciprocity foreign consular officers in Persia will in future be permitted to receive and despatch by courier official mails up to a total weight of two kilogrananea. 2* As you are aware, this Legation was recently able to secure unofficial sanction from the Persian Government for an arrangement whereby official mails for His Jiajesty»s Consular Establishments in Eastern Persia are addressed to His Majesty's Vioe Consul at Zabedan (Duzdap) in sealed packages weighing not more than two kilogrammes and forwarded by him to their destination by the hand of unofficial couriers. This arrangement, which was only arrived at after the greatest difficulty and prolonged discussion, has this important advantage over the arrangement sanctioned in the memorandum under reference, that no limit is set on the number of such bags which nay be conveyed by the hand of one courier to any one consulate. I have yet to /learn The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, a.P., The Foreign Officelearn what effect If any the present regulations will have upon the unofficial system which I have described. An attempt to limit the number of bags forwardable by one courier to Sistan or Meshed would presumably be most unwelcome to the Government of India, whose correspondence with those posts is, I Imagine, fairly large at times. The Government of India, to whom I am forwarding a copy of the present desnatch, will doubtless inform me if later any such attempt is made. 3* In the meantime I should be grateful if I might be informed what precisely Is the position with regard to the question of reciprocity. Are Persian consular officers, in those parts of His Hajeaty^ territories in which such officers are actually serving, entitled to a similar privilege or, for that matter, to any form of privilege resembling it? Apart from the East Persian Consular Establishments, the question is of immediate interest to His Majesty^ Consulate at Xermanshah and His Majesty^ Vic© Consulate at Ramadan, which until the introduction of the original regulations enjoyed the privilege of receiving sealed bags by the hand of the Legation*3 official couriers from His Kajesty«s High Commissioner at Baghdad and the Legation, and of sending sealed bags by the name method. I understand that a very considerable confidential correspondence was formerly conducted in this way between Baghdad and Kermanshah, and that much inconvenience was occasioned by the necessity of abandoning the practice. It would therefore be advantageous to revert to the old /systemsyatea, but befor® doing ao I ahould pres\uaably require to be in a position to furnish the Persian Government with an assurance to the effect that similar privileges are or might be enjoyed by Persian consular officers in Great Britain, in India, and possibly also in Palestine. 4. I presume that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom set no limit to the weight of the diplomatic bag addressed to the Persian Legation In London, so that correspondence for the Persian Consulates oan be included in the diplomatic bag without prejudice to the amount of diplomatic correspondence. If that is so, even without formal reciprocity, the Persian Government enjoy in the United Kingdom the substance of the privilege, fhe transmission especially of cyphers from the Foreign Office to His Majesty's Consular Officers in Persia has been rendered difficult by the limitation of ^weight of the diplomatic bag. The weight of a packet containing both the cypher volume and the decypher volume of a cypher which is awaiting a safe opportunity here for forwarding to one of His Majesty’s Consular Officers I have just ascertained to be 5.5 lbs; so that the cypher and decypher volumes will have to be sent separately by successive couriers to Consular Officers if the concession of consular bags of two kilogrammes (4.4 lbs.) is to be of any value for the transmission of Cyphers. In this connection I should be grateful for detailed information on the following point which has frequently cropped up in recent negotiations with the /PersianPersian Government and on w'lich I have been unable to f ?nd any definite ruling: oan the poetal administration of a country object, on grounds of their Donoooly, without infringing international custom or usage, to the conveyance of correspondence from one internal noint to another by the hand of an individual, not being an employee of the national postal administration, provided such an individual, whether paid or not for hia cervices, confine himself to the conveyance of correspondence he tv sen two or more representatives of a foreign government? In other worda, is trie uractioe of sending correspondence^ safe hand' strictly legitimate? • *** regulations referred to and supplemented in the enclosed memorandum from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs formed the second enclosure in my despatch No. 438 of September 9th, 1930* I am also sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty*s High Commiesioner for *Iraq.

The Persian Postal authorities are contemplating a bi-wee^iy motor mail service from Bandar Abbas to Kerman timed to cover 340 miles in 48 hours* However as long at the Imperial Airways machines do not Call at Bandar Abbas the n service will not be of any use in connection with the Karachi* London Air Mail a^ the connection between the Bandar Abbas arid the two nearest ports of call via Lingah and J&amp;&amp;&amp; is at present most unsatisfactory. If Imperial Airways could land at Bandar Abbas and the motor mail service between the post and lerman was functioning it is estimated that tnex Bri tish firms and subjects in Kerman would alone send ±20 oz of letters per month to the United K ngdom.

Experience goes to show that all political disturbances which have hitherto taken place were due to the existence of this political Dak system. Although the Persian Government has for a long time known of the dangerous results of this system, still the situation did not allow them to place restrictions over it. Thank God that the Persian Government are now in a position to put an end to this procedure under regulations, and have therefore issued a Farman to the effect that in future the mails belonging to Foreign Legations cannot be despatched under their own arrangements, but everything will have to be put before the Persian Foreign Ministry, and with their permission will be despatched to foreign countries. The customs Officers on frontier posts have also been informed accordingly vie.:- Before handing over the in coming mails to the Legations or despatch of their out-going mails they should forward them direct to the Persian Foreign Ministry. In order to exercise full control over the mails of Foreign Representatives a special department has been created in the Persian Foreign Ministry.Minute Paper.

Some arrangement must be made in the near future, un- less the Persians intend to refuse all facilities for sending bags to consular officers.

Sir GENERAL POST OPPICS, LOFT Or, E.CJ.l. 19th I'.ovember, 1930. The Lith reference to the discussion at the Foreign Office on the 16th of October regarding difficulties which have arisen with the Persian authorities in connection with bags of confi dential correspondence sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to other Consular Officers in Persia, I am directed by the Postmaster General to say that he has given careful consideration to the various means of overcoming these difficulties. In his view the only satisfactory solution would lie in the adoption of one of the following alternatives:- (1) tha^ such correspondence should not be regarded as mail at all, and that a reciprocal agreement should be entered into between His Majesty's Government and the Government of ^ersia under which the correspondence would be transmitted as diplomatic matter exempt from Post Office control, nr (2) that the correspondence should be handed over to the Post Office for despatch in the ordinary mails to Persia. It appears to the Postmaster General that the exceptional arrangement suggested, under which the packets would be prepaid in postage stamps but forwarded by non-postal means as far as the Office of Pestination, the bags being then opened in the presence of the Persian Post Office staff, would not only raise questions of some difficulty as far as this Department is con cerned, but would probably be objected to by the Persian Post Office as a permanent arrangement, and would in any case give them a convenient pretext for raising further difficulties if they should at any time desire to do so. If/ Under-Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE.If, however, the bags are despatched in the ordinary mails and under ordinary Postal Union conditions, the difficulties which might be raised would apparently not be so serious. If the Secretary of State agrees that the correspondence for the Political Resident and Consular Officers should be sent in the ordinary Kails, the packets could either be sent separately in the same way as ordinary letters, or, if he prefers, the Postmaster Ceneral will be prepared to agree they should be despatched in sealed bags addressed to the Consul,etc., the necessary postage stamps being fixed to the label on each bag, which would be regarded as a single packet and enclosed in an ordinary mail bag for the office of destination. The maximum weight of each bag would have to be 2 kilograms, in accordance with the °ostal Union Regulations. It should, however, be pointed out that trie Persian Post Office may insist on examining tne contents of the bag, if, as is probable, their internal legislation empowers them to stop and open packets suspected of being contrary to the Postal Regu lations; and it would be difficult to resist their contention if tne bag contained any correspondence other than that for the addressee or persons living at the same address. (See Article 33, paragraph 4 of tne Postal Union Convention of .London). It would, of course, be desirable that the Foreign Office should indicate in each case by which of the available routes the bag should be forwarded, i.e. by P.

The -f answer to your questions (1) and (2) is certainly in the negative. The view of the Foreign Office is that consular officers are not entitled to ieeei,e closed bags without the intervention of a foreign post office and in the absence of any special treaty arrangements to that end. fou will have noticed that the Minister of Posts in his interview with the Oriental Secretary (reported in Clive's despatch No.516} referred on his own initiative to a system of couriers, and although we hope that when he has studied the question and given his promised reply/\ 4 7U Jt&gt;t4 t 1 * ^ t ~'~ 4 ' Uav4-, ^2 /J 6- &lt;&gt;w^ y. &gt;u reply, it may be possible to make some special arrangement, it is by no means impossible that the Minister of Posts after having made a suggestion of this kind may find that his government are determined not to allow consular couriers - see Tehran telegram No.142 of October 18th to Foreign Simla, which you sent us under cover of P 7950/30.

The suggestion wrs then made that the General Poet Office should provide the departments concerned with stamps and a defacing machine, but it is understood that this proposal is not acceptable to the Postmaster General. 2, I am therefore to enquire whether it would be possible to arrange that envelopes for inclusion in the bag for Bushire should be stamped and the stamps defaced by the clerk In charge of the telegraph office attached to the Foreign Office. 3. Failing that the only other method of avoiding these charges would appear to be to affix stamps to the label of the bag Itself, but it is by no means certain that this method would satisfy the Persian authorities. If, however, international postal regulations cover the despatch of a bag so stamped, there should be good grounds for protesting against any attempt on the part of the Persian post office to demand a surcharge on the contents. 4 The Secretary to the Post Office4 rw 4. Mr.Henderson would be glad to receive, ae soon as possible, Mr.Lees-Smith’s views on this matter in order that the continued payment of these charges may be avoided. 6.

I attach a more comprehensive draft on the question generally. The Persian action reported in Bushire telegrams of 6th November is inconsistent with the modus vivendi reached by Sir Robert Clive, and reported in Tehran telegram of 7th October, and the Charge d’Affaires may already have pointed this out. But we had better make sure. On the other hand, as you say, the Persians, by taking advantage of the letter of this arrangement, which makes no specific reference to the sealing of correspondence with the Consulate seal, can go far to make it of little value to us in practice. It will perhaps be worth asking the Foreign Office to take this point also up with Tehran! As regards Colonel Biscoe’s suggestions in telegram 0.117 on P. 7808/30, I think we shall do better to concentrate on securing the satisfactory performance by the Persians (including an arrangement as to the sealing of bags with the Consulate seal) of their undertaking for this period*. The Foreign Office are quite clear that we cannot invoke the Persian undertaking about the status qup in a matter of this nature. The undertaking is political in character, and had prinarily in view the position of the islands, etc., in the Gulf. The Minister has already made it clear that the prospect of a special modus vivendi for Bushire pending the removal of the Residency is negligible (compare/(compare his telegram of 13th October on P. 7131/30), and the question of accepting a sealed bag for transmission as a parcel can better be considered as part of the general question of arrangements after 1st January. I jUiMK discussed with Mr* Baxter tine aftonieoft uhe question of what is to happen after 1st January. The EasternHepartment frankly admit that they can see no way out of the difficulty. The Treaty Department is, it appears, of opinion that the present procedure as regards our Consular mails in Persia is quite irregular, and that the Persians are technically justified in taking exception to it; nor have we any very obvious means of retaliation. It is possible that we may end by a courier system, but the objections to this - particularly on the grounds of ■ ■ \ .111 W A W ftffinrf.iiinity 1i 8 aalr thu Purelgn om-gy iu ^unsulL Mi.

(E 6123/522/34) 14th November 1930 My dear Laithwaite, Many thanks for your letter No. P.7253/30 of the 11th November to Baxter, to which I am replying as he is just clearing up prior to going on leave The telegrams from Bushire enclosed in your letter No. P.7808/30 of the 7th November show that the local authorities at Bushire are not carrying out satisfactorily the latest arrangements made with the Persian Government for out-going bags from the Residency. I think therefore it would be best to hold up the annual reports which are to go to Bushire until we are sure that in-going bags for the Residency are how receiving satisfactory treatment. I will keep my eye on the matter and, if we receive no evidence on the point within the next few weeks, will write to you further. It may be necessary then to ask Bushire by telegraph whether the arrangements for their in-going bags are being satisfactorily carried out. Yours aJlneei^iy,' J.G.

(Sgd.) J.Ge Laithwaite.Copy (Y 970/140/650} No* 516* British Legation,- Tehran 22nd October, 1930 [&gt; Sir In continuation of my despatch No. 496 of October 7th, I have the honour to inform you that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to whom I had notified acceptance of the provisional arrangements regarding Consular Postal bags pending a further discussion with the Persian Government, replied to me on October 8th that the provisional arrangements would be in force up to January 1st next only and that after that date Consular mills would not receive further special treatment. On October 15th he addressed a further note to me calling attention to the fact that the provisional agreement only covered the Consult.te General at Bushire and the Vice Consulate at Duzdap. The Chief of the Protocol Department had previously telephoned to the Legation in the same sense, a question having arisen at Meshed concerning our Consular mail there. 2* In view of these difficulties and the categorical state ment that after January 1st our Consular post would have to conform to the ordinary postal regulations, I requested the Oriental Secretary to seek an interview with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and discuss with him as frankly as possible the question of Consular bags and of the Legation parcels bags via Russia. 3. Mr. Havard saw the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on October li. th, and I enclose a summary of the conversation which passe The light Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office.passed. The Minister appeared anxious to help, provided that the prestige of his administration was upheld. He promised to study the matter and to let me know what, if any, special arrangements could be made. 4. The Minister in question, who in general political matters is somewhat of a back number and who, in consequence, has little direct centrettwith this Legation, may possibly have felt flattered at my direct appeal to him for a satisfactory arrange ment and, unless overruled by Teymourtache, may well try to find some acceptable solution. His suggestion of a system of couriers, made without any hint from the Oriental Secretary, would appear to show that he is not unwilling to make some concession. In the meantime I have suggested to the Government of India that Duzdap Vice Consulate might be used from now on as a clearing house for letters to and from Meshed and Sistan. 5. In conclusion, the remark let fall by the Minister as regards the 1841 Treaty may be regarded as an echo of the view probably expressed at some recent meeting of the Council of Ministers. 6. Copies of this despatch have been sent to The Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Buahire, Meshed and Duzdap. I have, etc., (Signed) R.H.Clive.Enclosure in Tehran despatch No.516 of 22nd October, 1950. Hie Majesty’s Minister: Ivjll i'. .rvCi-&lt;j-iO « I spent nearly two hours this morning with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs# He talked a good deal of all he had done and was going to do in his Ministry and I did my 'best to encourage him and generally butter him up. At length he allowed me to broach the subject matter of my visit. I said that Farrokh had telephoned me yesterday about Meshed Consulate General and a Consular bag, saying that the provisional agreement only covered Duzdap and Bushire. I pointed out to Minister special necessity for ensuring safety of Meshed mails and suggested that Consul General Meshed and Consul bistan send their letters by safe hand to Vice Consul, Duzdap, who would then have them put into bags in Persian Post Office and sent off. The same arrangement to hold for incoming mail, letters for bistan and Meshed being in double envelopes, the outer one being addressed to Vice Consul, Duzdap. He said he thought there was no objection but would find out. He suggested that it would be more in conformity with regular practice if Consulate at Meshed handed over a bag to Post Office, Meshed, for carriage to Duzdap, saying he had quite a reliable postmaster at Meshed and the person who carried the mails was also worthy of confidence. I countered this suggestion by saying the mail contractor had not always been a person of confidence, that we knew our mails had been tampered with in the past, that there were very important letters going out from Meshed and that it was a long and lonely way to Duzdap; that I did not doubt that His Pbccellency had worked wonders in Tehran and places nearer, but that /sincesince the Agabekoff revelations we simply wanted tranquility of mind as regards our provincial post* He said he had read articles by Agabekoff, but I told him that Agabekoff had told the Surete many details which had not appeared in the press and that I could assure him that there was every necessity for us to make sure that our letters were in really safe hands. He admitted that perhaps he had not yet had sufficient time to reorganise the provincial posts as he had succeeded in doing at Tehran, but that he would speed up matters. I agreed and said it was just during such a period that we wanted security. He promised to enquire and see if what I suggested could be granted. I then referred to the general question of the ; io\i, lonal agreement and asked for a prolongation and gave him many reasons. I pointed out that the Consul General at Bushire was also Political Resident and received diplomatic ags for the carrying on of his work outside Persia. He said that he thought the Persian Government only recognised him as Consul General, but I said that that was true as being the point of view of the Persian Government of today hut that he had originally gone there as the result of a TreatywibhPersia. He said he thought that the subsequent war of 1856 put an end to that Treaty. I replied that there were two points of view and that International Law did not give a definite pronouncement on the question. But apart from that the fact remained that that Officer was for purposes outside Persia a diplomatic agent corresponding direct with Ministries in London and India.\ The Minister \ said he had heard that he might leave Persia eCnd I said that was true, but while he remained we would like to have the provisional period extended for Bushire as well as for ! uzdap. He suggested a system of couriers, and I said that /if! if the Persian Government would accept that, it would he an alternative to the prolongation of the present arrangement, hut that I thought the Persian Government were asking the Soviet to give up their Consular couriers. He then suggested that the couriers might come to Bushire and Duzdap with hags addressed to the Legation and hand them over at Buehlre and Duzdap* I said that I thought that might provide another alternative solution as our only worry was to make sure that our correspondence did not fall into the hands of unauthorised persons. He said he would study this question and let me know, I then talked about our parcels bags and told him that these bags contained parcels only for people in the Legation who benefited by Customs franchise; that they were at present addressed to the Minister, which the Persian Government disliked as being against the International Postal Convention, I said we had offered reciprocal treatment but that it had been refused, our only object was to be able to get parcels of things from London which we could not obtain here and should i till be able to obtain now with exchange restrictions. If he preferred, these bags could be addressed to the Postal Administration with a special mark and could be opened in the Post Office in the presence of a member of the Legation, He asked why the : 'ersian Government should not open them without the presence of a member of the Legation and I said that undoubtedly they would have a right to do so if they wished, but Minister was willing to give a guarantee that the contents were only destined for those who had a right to them, I reminded him that these bags came through Russia where parcels post in transit to other countries* institutions was not allowed and I feared that if thesetags were addressed to the Post Office only they might stopped. He said he would enquire into that and let me know. He took note of the three points above and said it might take him as much as a fortnight to reply. he was extremely friendly and gave me the impression of wishing to arrange these matters if he could safeguard the prestige of his office. He asked me how Meshed had managed with his poet so far. I said I did not know, but that for important letters I did not think the Consul General has used the Persian Post. He said he had told his man in Meshed to leave the status quo. During the conversation he referred to the desirability of transferring the frontier Post Office from Duadap to Mirjawa. I told him that we were negotiating about the Mirjawa-Duzdap section of the line and that I thought he would find it more convenient to postpone any action in that until the fate of this section of the railway was settled. Re asked how long I thought it would be and I said I hoped it would not be very long. Perhaps we might ask Meshed if he is having difficulty over his post and we might suggest to India their using Duzdap Vice Consulate as a temporary clearing office for Sietan and Meshed. (Intlld.)

Br i g&amp; t i on, Gulhek, October 7th, 1930. Sir, With reference to my despatch No.438 of the 9th ultimo and my telegrams Nos.218, 219, 227 and 247 of September 15th, 22nd and October 5th respectively, relative to the questions of postal, diplomatic and consular mails, I think it well to Inform you, for purposes of record, of the position at the time of writing, (a ) Diplomatic malls . In accordance with a verbal assurance which I received from the Minister of Court on the 4th instant the date upon which the new regulations affecting foreign diplomatic couriers and diplomatic mail has now been altered from November 21st next to January 1st, 1931. I understand that my German Colleague intends to protest against the bags being restricted to a weight of fifteen kilos. (b) Consular mails . During the past three weeks the local authorities at Bushire have behaved in a most discourteous and obstructive manner towards His Majesty’s Consul- General, in spite of my representations to the Persian Government the acting Governor refused to maintain the status quo pending the discussion and settlement of the matter here. Colonel Biscoe has therefore been obliged, provisionally and without prejudice to any arrangement which The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson,^.P., The Foreign Office.which may be made in the future, to pennit his incoming malls to be opened in the Persian Post Office in the presence of a representative from the Consulate-General, But the authorities concerned have refused to authorise the despatch by hfcn of any outward mails excepting through the Persian Post Office and for the past three weeks Colonel Biscoe has therefore been unable to forward any confidential matter either to India or to London. 2. In addition to this attitude of obstruction I should add that the postal officials have also thought fit to shew gratuitous discourtesy towards Colonel Biscoe on the 17th September when the incoming bag was opened by the postal officials in the presence of a representative of the Consulate-General the words 'Political Resident*' on certain envelopes were erased and the following words written 'addressee unknown deliver to British Consul- General if known • As I represented to the minister for Foreign Affairs this action was too absurdly childish to be taken really seriously; nevertheless it provides a good example of the policy of pin-pricks to which Colonel Biscoe has been subjected recently. 3, (c) Postal mails via Russia . No difficulty has so far been experienced in regard to the receipt of these bags. I trust that I shall be able to arrange for them to continue as usual on condition that they are opened at the Persian Post Office in the presence of a representative of this Legation. 4. As you will have observed from the telegram which I addressed to His Majesty’s Consul General, Bushire on 5th instant (repeated to the Foreign Office No. 247) my latest representations on the subject of the Consular ^ils were addressed to His Highness the Minister of Court on the 4th4th of October, I thought it well to impress on His Higfrness that preferential treatment in the matter of Consular mails is apparently being accorded to certain Soviet Consulates in Persia and to insist that the status quo must be maintained for the present. I further enquired why the Persian Government were not willing to conclude a reciprocal agreement with His Majesty’s Government (please see my telegram No. 218 of September 15th). His Highness definitely premised that our privileges in this respect should be no less than those accorded to the Soviets and he further promised to consider the possibility of a reciprocal agreement. 5. As a result of these verbal representations I received on the 6th instant a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (copy of which I have the honour to enclose herein) sanctioning certain provisional arrangements whereby His Majesty’s Consular Officers concerned may continue to receive and send their mails, more or less as in the past, until January 1st next. The chief difference that the bags have to be opened and closed in the Post Office instead of in the Consulate, a representative of the Consulate being present. 6. As I was authorised by you. Sir, in your telegram No. 192 of the 23rd ultimo, to make such arrangements as were possible with the Persian Government with regard to the Consular mails I have replied to this note agreeing to the suggestions made therein for the reception and trans mission of these mails by His Majesty’s Consular Officers. While I realise that the opening and closing of Consular mails at the local Persian Postal departments will entail a certain amount of inconvenience to His Majesty’s Consular Officers I feel convinced that the only course possiblepossible is to accept such an arrangement provisionally pending a further discussion of the question with the Persian Government during which I shall attempt once again to induce them to conclude a reciprocal arrangement embracing the Diplomatic and Consular mails and also the postal bags which are addressed to this Legation via Russia. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure to the Foreign Secretary to the Government Of India, His Majesty's Acting High Commissioner for 'Iraq, His Majesty’s Consul General at Bushire, and to His Majesty's Consul General at Meshed who, it is requested, will kindly infom His Majesty's Vice Consul at Duzdap. I have, etc., (Signed) R.ii.Clive.(Y 937/140/650) Translation. Prom the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to Hit Majesty’s Minister. Dated nehr 13th 1309 (October 5th 1930) Private. My dear Minister, Your Excellency’s esteemed notes of September 30th and October 3rd were duly received. In reply I have the honour to inform you that although the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs are in principle entirely against the adoption of a special arrangement regarding the taking delivery and distribution of the posts of the Consulates yet as I had promised to you, I have considered the matter and hereby inform you that the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs has agreed to the following arrangement which has also been approved by the council of Ministers under the following termsj 1. The postal bags received which are addressed to the Consulates of both parties will be opened at the local Postal Administration the contents of the same will be handed over in the presence of a representative from the Consulate. In case some articles are found in the bags which are against the postal regulations they will be dealt with in accordance with the said regulations, 2. The postal letters (correspondence) of the Consulates will be put in the bag and closed at the Postal Administration In the presence of a delegate from the Consulate. All the contents (of the bag) should be in accordance with the postal regulations. 3. This arrangement will hold good up to the 1st of January 1931 on condition of reciprocal treatment. Thereforet«*v Therefore, In case you agree with the above arrange ment, please let me know in writing so that I may cause necessary instructions to be issued to the postal depart ments concerned. In the circumstances it is obvious that the postal bags referred to above will be opened and closed only in the Post Office in the presence of the Consulate Represent- % ative. As regards the statement which Your excellency has made to the effect that the conditions with the British Consulates, are less favourable when compared with the Soviet Consulates, while referring you to His Excellency Ghaffari^ note of Shahrivar 27th 1309 (September 18th 1930) in which it is stated that none of the foreign Powers and especially the Soviet Government has been given the right of having special post in Persia, it may be assumed that the information received by Your Excellency is unfounded. With regard to the statement made (in Your Excellency^ letter) in connection with the title of 'Resident politique' in the Persian Gulf, I have to state that, as it has already been brought to your notice, the Persian Government does not recognise such a title for anybody. The only Government institution of the British Government which the Persian Government recognises in Bushire is that of the Consulate-General under the superintendence of a Consul-General. It la, therefore, advisable that correspondence with the British Consul-General in Bushire should be made in the same title which has been recognised by the Persian Government, namely that of 'British Consul-General'. As regards the statement made in Your Excellency’s letterletter of October 3rd to the effect that the Customs Office does not allow the despatch of diplomatic courier of the British Consul In Kermanshah to Teheran and Baghdad and that the Soviet Consulates are in a more favourable position, I beg to inform you that no agreement has been reached between the Persian and British Govern ments whereby the Consul in Kermanshah may have the right of sending diplomatic courier and that the Soviet Consulate in Kermanshah has neither been given such a right. The matter which may have caused confusion for Your Excellency is the fact that the Persian Government had, some years ago, made an arrangement with the Soviet r Government subject to reciprocal treatment whereby it (the Persian Government) secured for five (Persian) Consulates in Soviet territory the right of sending diplomatic courier, but now in accordance with the recent decision of Shahrivar 1st 1309 (August 23rd 1930) it (the Persian Government) has abolished this right and that the Consulates of both parties will no longer enjoy such a right. In view of the foregoing, I feel sure that Your Excellency’s object has completely been secured and you will also admit that the Imperial Government, in deference to Your Excellency’s wishes, is always prepared to extend its assistance within all possible means. I avail myself of this opportunity etc. (Signed) Froughi./ .JO'uuiag street. r ^ ... v b v JL950* hy dear Eastwood I m very sorry to trouble &gt;ou «^aln about our italic for I us&lt;*lre t but we j*rc gettliig a litule uneasy about the difficulty milch is being experienced in getting uome arrangement aade at Ulm end. nave now decpatcued several btigs since we heard ttet Biscoe was being ct*arged double postage f ^nd we feel a little ci*ary of sending faru.er tags anAl some system of staipiiig ms been settled upon.

Mr. Blaxter represented the Colonial Office. The Post Office, who had been invited to attend, did not send a representative. It appeared that the Post Office has seen insuperable objections of principle to any arrangement on the lines suggested in the note ow Pyx?/ below. They regarded it as essential that stamps should be fixed-and' defaced only by a regular postal official, and, in these circumstances, could suggest nothing but that we should either (a) send over our secret'mail to the nearest Post Office, to be stampod and put in a bag there; or (b) put our mail in a bag, stamp the bag, and trust to the Persians not pressing a claim for double postage on letters contained within the bag on its being onened. The general feeling of the meeting was tha - there were strong objections to the first of these alternatives, and that v;e could not depend on Persian goodwill as regards the second. After discussion, o.ppf*an»d/appeared that the following methods of meeting the problem were suggested - (a) the Post Office to agree to letters being stamped and defaced by the Foreign Office Telegraph clerk - the telegraph clerk is, it appears, a postal official; (b) the Post Office to be asked to agree to a postal official being sent over from the Parliament Street office half an hour before the bag was due to close on Fridays for the purpose of ■stamping and defacing secret mail, which could then be placed in the bag, sealed and despatched in the ordinary wa v . Failing acceptance of either (a) or (b), the possibility to be explored of enclosing r.ail for the Resident (which has not normally exceeded a total weight of 1 lb.) in a single envelope and sending it as a. letter packet enclosed in a bag, which would, however, be stamped with the full postage required. It was agreed that as soon as the Foreign Office heard officially from the Post Office of their rejection of the proposals previously made, they should make counter-proposals on these lines.PHHHHHHPIHP Telegram P No. From To* •• ••• 3346 424 dated (and reed) 30th Septr.

The position is that Sir Robert Clive’s representations to the Persian Government have brought about a reciprocal arrangement to operate until 1st Janua ry, 1931, under‘which bags addressed to Consulates shall be opened in the local post office in the presence of a Consulate representative, while ba^s sent by Consulate^ shall be made.up and closed at the local post office in the presence of a Consulate representative. The Persians treat the contents of all bags sent to the Resident as postal matter, and change double on anything unstamped. There are three routes concerned - (a) long sea route via Bombay to Bushire; ■*f ^ (b) sea route to , thence by air to Bushire, v Baghdad; (c) air mail, London to Bushire, via Baghdad. It*was generally agreed that the only satisfactory solution of the difficulty which had arisen was that, in view of the attitude of the Persian authorities, we should prepay all letters, whether sent by air mail or not. It was also agreed that in the case of category (a) it would be better that the prepayment should be done at this end. There was some uncertainty as to the precise nature of the Bombay-Karachi sea post offne arrangement, and it was possible that letters taken/&lt;@&gt; taken out for stamping or defacement at Bombay might miss the onward mail to the Gulf. Finally it was decided that, subject to no objection being raised by the General Post Office, defacement should be provided for by the issue of defacing stomps to the Departments concerned, who could then do their o’-n defacing before closing their bags. The Post Office representative premised to take up the various points which had arisen ''ith his authorities, and let us know ’'hether any difficulty was seen as soon as possible. As regards the air mail, the o,uestion arose whether we should not in fact be paying twice for the carriage of the same letters. m e already pay Imperial Airways by weight. If we stamp our letters in addition (it was agreed that this would be necessary if we were to avoid surcharges in Persia), we shall in effect be paying twice. The Post Office representative mentioned that stamps were issued without payment by the Post Office to Government Departments, a paper credit only being shown. In effect, therefore, the stamps were little more than labels. If there was any difficulty in reaching an arrangement with Imperial Airways ('-'horn the Foreign Office undertook to approach),we should not reallj be substantially the worse off if we did in fact stamp our letters as well as paying the air mail charge. In any case, the correspondence sent by air mail to the Resident at Bushire v/as relatively insignificant in amount • It was agreed to await the result ox discussion between the Post Office representative and his Department before taking action. Subject to no objection being raised by the Post Office, I submit that arrangements on the lines proposed might be accepted so far as this Office/Office is concerned. Once a decision is taken, we shall have to telegraph to India and consult them as to the adoption of a corresponding procedure for mails sent from India to British Consulates in Persia.* ♦ I M p ° RTAH T TELEGRAM 1'rcpi the Resident Persies Qulf to the Secretary cf State for the Colonies♦ Dated 16th Ootoher, 19?50.

I am informed that a communication on the subject has already been addressed to the Postmaster General in London as the practice would appear to be contrary to the regulations of the International Postal Convention, and that the matter has been brought to the notice of His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Teheran.

No special arrangement is in force as regards mails for Kerman which are apparently carried by Persian Post except the documents of a very secret nature which at times are sent to the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan for transmission by safe opportunity.XMHSPI AT1% ‘ INDIA DirifcWiJI British Legation, 0 u 1 h e k, September 9th,1930* Sir, With reference to m&amp;r despatch No* 90 of February 28th and previous correepondenoe respecting the &lt;$aestionjf of postal and diplomatic mails I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies in translation of the following documents* (a) a memorandum dated the 28th ultimo which I have received from the iinistry for Foreign Affairs. (b) New Regulations affecting foreign diplomatic couriers md diplomatic mail* 2* With regard to (a) above you will observe that the Persian Government have definitely refused to conclude the reciprocal agreement which I proposed to them under your instructions in November 1928 and that they request that the postal bags addressed to this Legation and the bags which pass between the Government of India and the Consulates in this country shall be discontinued* 2. With regard to (b} above you will observe that not only must all diplomatic mail entering Persia be carried by a courier but that a courier will in future only be permitted to carry on each journey mail not exceeding fifteen kilos in weight irrespective of whether such mail is destined for one Government Department or for several. This restriction is hi^ily objectionable as the diplomatic mail •Ihe Eight Honourable Arthur Henderson, M*P., The Foreign Office*i^irM-nT mail from this Legation which is forwarded to London via Baghdad usually weighs more thm this, indeed it sometimes weighs nearly twice as much* 4* rhese new regulations while they affect the official mails of this Legation , the postal hags received from Juondon via ioissia end the Consular bags, may also conceivably affect the sealed bags passing between India, Baghdad and London which are carried by Imperial Airways via the Persian Gulf, since these ore not in charge of a courier and are not technically diplomatic. 5. I should here explain that as soon as I had read these regulations which were published in the Persian news paper 'Iran” on the 31st ultimo and were later communi cated to me officially by the Persian Government, I took the opportunity of a visit to the Minister of Court to mention the matter to His Richness. reymourtache, ¥ho seemed rather vague on the subject, suggested that the regulations need not interfere either with the postal bags destined for this Legation or with the Consular bags and he asked me to communicate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointing out the objections and criticisms which l entertained. 6. This I was about to do when I received the memorandum from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs which had been delayed in reaching me and which forms the first enclosure to this despatch* 7. in the face of the definite refusal on the part of the Persian Government to enter into a reciprocal agreement withwith His ll&amp;jesty’a Government for the transmission of postal bags I considered that no useful purpose would be served by returning to the charge with the minister for Foreign Affairs and X decided that it would be best to request your further Instructions as to the attitude which I should now adopt towards the j?ersian Government in this matter both of the postal bags via Russia and of the Consular bags to and from India. 8. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosures, have been sent to the Foreign Department of the Government of India and to His Majesty^ Consular Officers at Bushire and Meshed* I have the honour to bw with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R. H. CLIVE.IPranslation From the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Legation. Dated Shahrivar 6th,1309 (August 28th,3-930) Ho. 14557/81071). Memorandum. With referenoe to the memorandum dated July 28th 1930 of His Britannic Majesty’s Legation whioh was handed personally by His Excellency the British to His Highness the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to draw the attention of that honourable Legation to the following points 1. As regards the statement made in the note under reply that no definite reply has been given to the notes-verbaux Ho. 303 of November 27th 1928 and No. 185 of May 23rd 1929 regarding the proposal made for the despatch of postal bags by the foreign Office in London to the British Legation in Tehran and vice versa, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs begs to state that a mistake has apparently been made in this connection since a reply has been sent to the notes - verbaux mentioned above in this Ministry’s note No. 7477/371 of Khordad 9th 1308 (May 30th 1929 ) and in which the proposal in question has been re jected. 2. Some time later a similar proposal was made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the note No. 263 of July 27th 1929 (isTurdad 5th 1308) regarding the despatch of correspondence between the British Consulates in Persia and the Political and Foreigi Department of the Government of India. It was clearly stated In the reply which was sent to the note mentioned above on Shahrivar 21st 1308(September 12th 1929)-2- 5 4 1929) under no* 10088/736 that the despateh of special direct bags outside the limits of the general postal regulations destined to foreign representatives was in contravention of the postal regulations of the country and, as it was not possible to take any action in respect of the mail (bags) of that honourable Legation, the Ministry regretted that it would not be able to agree with the proposal in favour of the Consular officers either* In addition, the Ministry for foreign Affairs begs leave to draw the attention of that honourable Legation to the memoranda Ho. 352 of Farvardin 15th 1308 (April 4th 1929) ^°* 7263/343 of Ordibehesht 31st 1308 (May 21st 1929), ^o. 12023/1109 of Shahrivar 25th 1308 (September 16th 1929 ) and Ho. 17978/2607 of Fsfand 17th 1308 (March 8th 1930) in which protest has repeatedly been made against the anomalous procedure adopted by the British Post Offices and the con cerned Consulates in Persia. The Honourable Legation will, therefore, admit that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has emphatically and clearly stated in the memoranda referred to above that the Persian Government are excused to accept any mail except the usual one in Persia and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs while considering the points mentioned above as a definite reply to all the proposals submitted by that honourable Legation in this connection, requests that, after communicating with the concerned quarters of His Britannic Majesty's Government on the subject, arrangements may be made so that an end may be put definitely to this anomalous condition which affects the Persian postal integrity.

If addressed only “British Ctonsulate^General;’ Persians will presumably then demand that the letters should no longer be addressed to the Politioal Resident but to the Consulate-General. Unless it is proposed to make the major concession, it would seem undesirable to make minor concessions except to the extent mentioned above. Reference ray telegram No.78 to (? Tehran), I would explain that the Persian post has delivered letters addressed 'Political Resident' ever since the abolition of the British Post Office. Their action was, therefore, gratuitous rudeness. If the Persian authorities desired to raise the matter, it should have been raised officially. If, hov/ever, it is iesired to use tfee removal of the Residency as counter in the negotiations, it would seem essential to maintain the rights of the Resident to be hei-e under the 1841 Treaty; otherwise the counter loses its value.

Out' going mail, which is much smeller than Inward mall, should be put in begs in presence of customs representative at Residency as at present and sealed and then stamped and handed over to the Post Office for transmission as parcel. I cannot see how Persians could object to this, as presumably any one can despatch letters by parcel post. Only drawback is that registered parcels have to be posted on Saturday and mall leaves Sunday. If Persian authorities could instruct post to accept this parcel on the day malls leave, it would give more time for closing bogs and obviate bags remaining over'night in post. In accordance with your instructions, last bag was opened in the presence of my representative end contents delivered to me, after payment of full fee on under-stamped letters. It will be necessary to inform Presidency Postmaster, Bombay, by September 25th at latest, whether bags should be made up for me or not. * Cb» ill *0 \ ^ EISr^TnllTTO T uecoae. D. R. t&gt;ir rc.

With reference to the memorandum dated July £8th 1930 of Hie Britannic Majesty's Legation which was handed personally by his xceliency the British (yWrfQA to His i.i^^hnesa the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs / has the honour to draw the attention of that honourable Legation to the following points 1. As regards the statement made in the note under reply that no definite reply has been given to the notes-verbcux Ho. 303 of November 27th 1928 end Ho. 185 of 'ay 23rd 1929 regarding the proposal made for the despatch of postal bags by the Foreign Office in London to the British Legation in Tehran and vice versa, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs begs to state that a mistake has apparently been made in this connection since a reply has been sent to the notes - verbaux mentioned above in this Ministry's note ho. 7477/371 of Kherdad 9th 1308 (May 30th 1929 ) and in which the proposal in question has been re jected. 2. Soae tiia* later a similar proposal was made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the note iio. 263 of July 27th 1929 (j^urdad 5th 1308) regarding the despatch of correspondence | between the British Consulates in Persia and the political and Forei^i Department of the Government of India. It was clearly stated in the reply which was sent to the note mentioned above on Shahrivar 21st 1308(September 12th 1929)1929) under Ho. 10088/786 that the deep at oh of special direct bags outside the limits of the general postal regulations destined to foreign representatives was in contravention of the postal regulations of the country and, as it was not possible to take any action in respect of the mail (bags) of that honourable Legation, the Ministry regretted that it would not be able to agree with the proposal in favour of the Consular officers either. In addition, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs begs leave to draw the attention of th:t honourable Legation to the memoranda So. 352 of Farvardin 15th 1308 (April 4th 1929) ho. 7263/343 of Ordibeheaht 31st 1308 (May 21st 1929), ho. 12023/1109 of Shahrivar 25th 1308 (September 16th 1929 ) and ho, 17978/2607 of Esfaad 17th 1308 (March 8th 1930) in which protest has repeatedly been rn^de against the anomalous procedure adopted by the British Post Offices and the con- w cemed Consulates in Persia. fhe Honourable Legation will g therefore, admit that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has emphatically and clearly stated in the memoranda referred to above that the Persian Government are excused to accept any mail except the usual *§.1 ion one in Persia and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs while considering the points mentioned above as a definite reply to all the prop© eel s submitted by that honourable Legation in this connection, requests that, after oomnruiiicating with the concerned quarters of His Britannic Majesty's Government on the subject, arrangements nay be made so that an end may be put definitely to this imomalous condition which affects the Persian postal integrity.
