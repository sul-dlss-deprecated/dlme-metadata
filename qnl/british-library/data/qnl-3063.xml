James Dow, Assistant Surgeon, temporarily in charge of the Residency, explains that Captain Thomas Perronet Thompson's enquiries into the matter would have been answered sooner, were it not for the fact that Dow has been awaiting the return of Bruce, who would have more accurate information to offer. Dow encloses a copy of Bruce's official letter on the subject (not included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000075#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
