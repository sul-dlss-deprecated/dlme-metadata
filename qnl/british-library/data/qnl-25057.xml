I have the honour to forward herewith for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council, a list of the rifles ammunition, etc., captured during the Arms Traffic Operations in the Persian Gulf, which are at present lying in the Naval Ordnance Depot, Bombay. 2. It is understood that all the arms and ammunition captured by His Majesty’s Ship “ Fox” in November 1909 were to be retained pending the settle ment of the question as to_ their restitution to His Highness the Sultan of Masqat. My records on this subject are, however, not very clear and end with my predecessor’s telegram No. 63 of 20th May 1910, (in reply to Government of India telegram No. 901-M. of 18th May 1910) reporting that these arms were stored at Bombay. 3. It is not known for what reasons the rifles, etc., captured by His Majesty’s Ship “ Perseus ” in May 1910 and by His Majesty’s Ship “ Hyacinth ” in January rp 11, were retained. The approval for retention in the case of the former was contained in Government of India telegram No. 1058-M. of 20th June 1910. 4. Should the arms, etc., captured by “Fox” be no longer required, it is proposed that all non-serviceable rifles and ammunition and the 80 old bayonets be destroyed. 5. I have the honour to enquire whether the serviceable rifles of prohibited bore and ammunition can be put to any use by the Government of India, and, if so, that early instructions may be given respecting their disposal as otherwise they will rapidly deteriorate having recently been removed from the packing in which they have previously been kept. I have been given to understand that the *45' / Martini Henry rifles are identical with those used by the Armed Police in India and it is thought that the remainder of the rifles might perhaps be utilised for Training Corps or other useful purpose.

In reply I am to convey the following instructions with regard to the disposal of the arms, ammunition, etc., specified under the different heads in the list referred to above :— (a) The serviceable rifles of non-prohibited bore should remain on charge for purposes of presentation. (b) The serviceable rifles of prohibited bore, with the exception of the twenty-seven *303' / Lee Speed rifles (without bolts) which may be destroyed, should also remain on charge as they may be required in case it is decided to assist the Governor-General, Kerman, or the Governor of the Gulf Ports with arms.

C20AD 20 - 26-6.13—GC 3 P SimlaYour telegram of 11th ultimo. Admiralty in paragraph 11 of their letter N.L. 5333, dated 9th October 1911, suggested breaking-up value of arms. Our rate 3 f Rs. 15 per 100 accorded with this suggestion. They now propose to follow precedent of “ Proserpine ” and ask 3s. 6d. We do not understand how this rate has been arrived at. Strictly following that precedent, rate should be, wherever possible, as laid down in revised Appendix XV., Army Regulations, India, Vol. II. We, however, leave decision to your Lordship. We have retained only the following:—35 Mauser and Mannlicher captured by Miner ” inAugust 1912 for presentation purposes ; 723 Martini- Metford carbines, captured by “Perseus” in May 1910; 261 Martini- Metford carbines and 250 '45 M.H. long rifles, captured from “ Badil” in November 1909. These have been kept in case it is decided to assist Governors-General, Kerman, or Gulf ports with arms. About 25 arms, various, have been presented to officers of steamship companies for services rendered. All others have been destroyed.

Your telegram of 2nd instant regarding prize money. We considered 25 per cent, of value as decided by Admiralty was very liberal remuneration and suggested 10 per cent, in paragraph 3 of our Marine Despatch No. 7, dated 22nd August, as arms and ammunition could not be utilised for any service purposes. But if you consider we should follow percentage decided upon by Admiralty in case of captures made by vessels other than the “Philomel” we are prepared to agree. Value of arms and ammunition captured by “ Philomel ” on 24th April 1910 is assessed by Political Agent at Maskat, at 14,433Z. 16s. No definite valuation was made in case of dhows captured, but from Naval Commander-in-Chief’s records Political Agent at Maskat gathers that value of both dhows was 400L, but says that this is only rough estimate from available data.frt 29th October, 1912. Dear Sir, I am replying to your letter of the 22nd to Mr. Nicholson, as the question of prize money is not dealt with by his Branch. The grant made in 1909, for captures in the Persian Gulf, to the Officers and men of the “Proserpine*' was on the basis, not of a percentage, but of the total value of the dhows and ammunition as assessed by the local authorities, plus the breaking-up value of the arms as estimated by the Indian Government. Prize money usually consists of the value which captured Vessels and Stores would possess if sold in open market and it will be seen that there was a considerable departure from this principle in the “Proserpine' case for the arms if thus sold would have produced a much larger sum than their breaking-up value. The low breaking-up value of the weapons resulted in a disproportionate value attaching to the ammunition captured as compared with the arms, although the latter werewere the main object of the operations and it was considered that the above system did not admit of a fair reward being paid to the Captors. On the other hand it was recognised that the arms were of no use to India and it was therefore proposed to calculate the award on a basis of 20% of the total value, as assessed by the British Consul at Muscat, of arms, dhows and ammunition together. We have not proposed any maximum sum for the award, but we think that a 20% basis will offer a barely fair reward and will entirely avoid any risk of an exces sive award. In fact 20% was really considered to be rathor too low if anything.22 Ootolbar 19.12. Dear Nicholson, Your N.L. 15259, 7 August 1912, prize money In Par si an Gul$.

Simla, the 22nd August igi2. My Lord Marquis, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship’s despatch (Sent in advance by the mail of the 15th August No. IOI (Political), dated the loth Novem- 19,20 # her 1911, on the subject of the grant of prize money in respect of the captures effected by His Majesty’s Ships engaged in the Arms Blockade in the Persian Gulf during the season 1909-10. 2. In view of the importance of suppressing the traffic in arms and the diffi culty and danger involved, the Admiralty consider it desirable that the officers and men engaged in the task should be specially rewarded, and have proposed that prize money should be awarded to the captors on a basis of 25 per cent of the total value of the captured dhows, arms and ammunition, assessed by His Majesty’s Consul at Maskat. The question has also been raised of a contri bution from Indian revenues towards the expenditure involved, which the Admiralty propose should be as follows (a) In the case of the captures made by H. M. S. “ Philomel ” any reward to the vessel to be reclaimed in due course; (b) With regard to the captures made by other ships, the Government of India to make a grant equivalent at least to the breaking up value of the arms and such further sum as may be agreed upon on account of the ammunition. Your Lordship enquires our views as to the amount which the Indian Exchequer may reasonably be expected to contribute in respect of the captures made by H. M. S. “ Philomel ” and by other ships, and desires information as to the disposal of the dhows and arms captured by His Majesty’s Ships “ Fox ” and “ Perseus” on the 4th November 1909 and 25th May 1910, respectively, and of the dhow seized by the former vessel on the 3rd December 1909. 3 . Having regard to the fact that the “Philomel” is one of the additional vessels specially employed in the Persian Gulf in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic and that India is bearing the total cost of her running and maintenance, we accept the total liability for any awards to be made on account of the captures made by this vessel. We are, however, of opinion that an award of 10 per cent of the values of the dhows, arms and ammunition would be a fair reward and we would suggest this for Your Lordship s consideration. 4.

I should also be glad to be informed as to the disposal of the dhows and arms referred to in paragraph 14 of the Admiralty letter.1L M Sir, ENCLOSURE Admiralty to India Office N.L. 5333. Admiralty, T 9tli October 1911. 1 am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint 3011 , foi the information of the Secretary of State for India, that they have under consideration applications from His Majesty’s ships ox, Lapwing, Philomel, and Perseus, for grants 111 the nature of prize money 111 lespect of captures in the Persian Gulf of dhows eng'aged in arms traffic. The facts of the captures are as follows :— H.M.S. Fox. 9 __ (i.) On the 4th November 1909, H.M .S. Fox, acting on infor mation received, proceeded to Lima Bay and there found close to the beach a dhoU*full of arms and ammunition, but without papers or colours and deserted by its crew. The local Chief denied any knowledge of the arms, but subsequently two men belonging to the crew were captured, and their evidence, as given before the Political Agent at Muscat, left no doubt that the captured dhow was actively engaged in arms running. The dhow was left in custody of the Sheikh as it could not be towed. The arms and presumably the ammunition also were retained in the Naval Ordnance Depot, Bombay, as the question of their restoration to the Sultan of Muscat was under the consideration of the Government of India. (ii.) On the 3rd December 1909, two boats belonging to H.M.S. Fox boarded on the high seas a dhow, belonging to Bushire, containing a cargo of arms and ammunition. No papers or colours were found in the dhow which was left in custody at Khor Fakan, while the cargo was destroyed at the request of the Government of India. H.M.S. Lapwing. 3. On the 4th December 1909 H.M.S. Lapwing captured a dhow laden with arms and ammunition 15 miles south of Keni River. No papers were found on board, but the nakoda confessed that the cargo belonged to Muscat. The dhow proved unsea worthy and was burnt off Bris Point, the cargo and crew being taken on board the “ Lapwing.” The cargo was subsequently sunk in deep water at the request of the Government of India. H.M.S. Philomel. 4 __q.) On the 6 th December 1909, when in latitude 23° 52' N., longitude 59° 24' E., the Philomel gave chase to, and captured, a dhow full of arms and ammunition. The nakoda stated that the arms belonged to the Afghans, that he shipped them at Muttra, and had intended landing anywhere on the Makran coast that he could. He believed that the cargo was intended for Kabul and Kandahar. The cargo was transferred to the Philomel, and the dhow, which had been struck bv a shot in the pursuit, sank. The cargo was afterwards sunk in deep water at the request of the Government of India. (ii.) On the 23rd January 1910, the First Lieutenant m command of H.M.S. Philomel's sailing pinnace, while boat cruising off Bunji, noticed a white building on shore. Lie landed with a party and marc le to the fort, three miles inland from Bump, and there found a supply of ammunition, which was successfully brought on board the pinnace. From information received from some natives it appeared that this ammunition was part of a large cargo landed four months previously 12139. B /from an Arab dhow. The ammunition was subsequently sunk in deep water at the request of the Government of India. (hi.) On the 24th April 1910, while cruising oh lias A1 Kuh, the Philomel sighted two dhows which went about and stood out to sea on seeing her. After giving chase and firing half a dozen rounds the Philomel overhauled them and found them full of arms. In neither case was there any attempt at concealment of the cargo. Both dhows were cleared, taken in tow, and towed towards Jashk, one being wrecked, while the other was subsequently released. In compliance with a request from the Government of India the arms and ammunition were sunk as a public example. H.M.S. Perseus. 5.—(i.) On the 1st January 1910, the Commanding Officer, 1I.M.S. Perseus, landed at Pishkan with a party of seamen and marines to search for a consignment of arms and ammunition which, he had been informed, was hidden among the hills, awaiting transport to the interior. The Sheikh of the village refused to lead the party to the place where the arms were hidden, whereupon he was made a prisoner and the party set off to the hills discovering the arms after a march of 14 hours. The arms were safely brought aboard the Lapwing and then thrown over board, in accordance with the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. (ii.) On the 25th May 1910 when in latitude 25° 22' N., longitude 58° 51/ E., the Perseus overhauled a dhow steering from seaward inshore. She was found to be laden with arms and ammunition and the crew had left her by the time she was boarded. After unloading the dhow, the Perseus took her in tow and proceeded to Jask, leaving her in charge of the Intelligence Officer there, Captain S. G. Cranford, Gordon Highlanders. The arms and ammunition captured were destroyed with the exception of 1,435 Martini Metford rifles and carbines ('303), which were retained in the Naval Ordnance Depot, Bombay, at the request of the Government of India. G. In addition to these independent captures a joint expedition in search of arms was carried out under the following circumstances : — 7. On the 15th January 1910 the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, was informed by Major Austin, C.M.G., D.S.O., R.E., that 1,800 rifles were stored at Geigan. He obtained the loan of a detachment of the 117th Mahrattas from Jashk, where they embarked at midnight, and on arrival off Geigan they landed together with 95 men from the Fox. It was considered impossible to get a guide without the object of the expedition leaking out, but the raid was nevertheless most ably and successfully canied out, though it involved most arduous work, a considerable portion being performed in the dark hours. The arms and ammunition captured were destroyed. 8 . In view of the importance of suppressing the traffic in arms in these regions, and the difficulty and danger of this task, my Lords consider it highly desirable that the officers and men of the ships engaged in this task should be specially rewarded as in previous cases, and they have therefore proposed to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty s Ireasury that awards should be made to the captors based on lo P er cent, of the values of the dhows, arms and ammunition, as assessed by His Majesty s Consul at Muscat. 9. As, however, the dhows, arms and ammunition have in nearly every case been destroyed at the request of the Government of India on grounds of public policy instead of being sold as usual in ordinary prize cases, and there are therefore no receipts to set against the cost ofGovernmPn,r U 'r’ the11 , L ™-&lt;lships of the Treasury consider that the that the Vif In ^a might properly be asked for a contribution, and au ard L ntade Ae SeCret,,r &gt;' ot State should be ascertained before an 10. As regards the captures made by H.M.S. Philomel J an o refer to Admiralty letter of the 27th June 1910, M. 4322, by which the Government of India was to bear the cost of running and main- aming the three ships Philomel, Odin, and Alert, including full pay wages ami liability for non-effective charges of ships’ complements, and to state that any award to the Philomel would accordingly be reclaimed in clue course. r V’hA li reSpeCt ° the ca P tures } A V the oth er ships it appears to my Lends that there are strong grounds for asking for a contribution from Indian funds, and they would be glad to know whether in these and similar captures the Secretary of State would be prepared to authorise a giant equivalent at least to the breaking up value of the arms, and such lurtner sum as may be agreed upon in respect of the ammunition. 12. I am also to enquire as to the disposal of the dhows referred to in paragraphs 2 and 5 (ii.), one of which was left in custody at Khor bakan and the other in charge of the Intelligence Officer at Jashk, also of the arms captured by the Fox on the 4th November 1909, and by the Perseii S on the 25th May 1910, which have been retained in the A aval Oidnance Depot, Bombay, and whether the Government of India will be prepared to make any contribution in respect of them. lo.

The facts of the captures are as follows “FOX ”. 2*- (i) On the 4th November 1909, H.M.S. 'Fox 11 acting on information received, proceeded to Lima Bay and there found close to the beach, a'dhow full of arms and ammunition, but without papers or colours and deserted by its crew. The local Chief denied any knowledge of the arms, but subsequently two men belonging to the crew were captured, and their evidence, as given before the Political Agent at Muscat, left no doubt that the captured dhow was actively engaged in arms running. The dhow was left in custody of the Sheikh as it could not be towed. The arms and presumably the ammunition also were retained in the Naval Ordnance Depot ,* Bombay, as the question of their restoration to the Sultan of Muscat was under the consideration of the Government of India. (ii) On the 3rd December 1909, two boats belonging to H.M.S. 'Fox 11 boarded on the high seas a dhow, belonging to Bushire containing a cargo of arms and ammunition. No papers or colours were found in the dhow which was left in custody at Khor Fakan while the cargo was destroyed at the he Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE. r RECEIVE u \ L.P.—No. 8.request of the Government of India. h.m.s. Lapwing '. 3. — On the 4th December 1909 H.M.S. '’Lapwing 11 captured a dhow laden wi th arms and ammunition 15 miles south of Ken e j River. No papers were found on board, but the Nakoda confessed that the cargo belonged to Muscat. The dhow proved unseaworthy and was burnt off Bris Point, the cargo and crew being taken on board the ”Lapwing”. 'The cargo was subsequently sunk in deep water at the request of the Government of India. H.M. S. ’’PHILOMEL M . 4. - (i) On the 6th December 1909 when in Latitude Longitude 59 0 24 , E., the ’’Philomel' gave chase to, and captured a dhow full of arms and ammunition. The Nakoda stated that the arms belonged to the Afghans., that he shipped them at Muttra and had intended landing anywhere on the Makran coast that he could. He believed that the cargo was intended for Kabul and Kandahar. The cargo was transferred to the 'Philomel', and the dhow which had been struck by a shot in the pursuit, sank. The cargo was afterwards sunk in deep water at the request of the Government of India. (ii) On the 23rd January 1910, the First Lieutenant in command of H.M.S. 'PhilomelV sailing pinnace while boat cruising off Bunji, noticed a white building on shore. He landed with a party and marched to the fort, three miles inland from Bunji, and there found a supply of ammunition, which was successfully brought on board the pinnace. From information received from some natives it appeared that this ammunition was part of a large cargo landed four months previouslypreviously from an Arab dhow. The ammunition was subsequently sunk in deep water at the request of the Government of India, (iii) On the 24th April 1910, while cruising off Ras AL Kuh, the “Philomelsighted two dhows which went about and stood out to sea on seeing her. After giving chase and firing half a dozen rounds the ' , Philomel ,, over hauled them and found them full of arms. In neither case was there any attempt at concealment of the cargo. Both dhows were cleared, taken in tow and towed towards Jashk, one being wrecked, while the other was subsequently released. In compliance with a request from the Government of India the arms and ammunition were sunk as a public example. H.M.S. “PERSEUS M . 5.- (i) On the 1st January 1910, the Commanding Officer, H.M.S. “Perseus“, landed at Pishkan with a party of seamen and marines to search for a consignment of arms and ammunition which, he had been informed, was hidden among the hills, awaiting transport to the interior. The Sheikh of the village refused to lead the party to the place where the arms were hidden, whereupon he was made a prisoner and the party set off to the hills discovering the arms after a march of 1£ hours. The arms were safely brought aboard the “Lapwing 11 and then thrown overboard, in accordance with the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. (ii) On the 25th May 1910 when in Latitude 25°22 , N., Longitude the “Perseus“ overhauled a dhow steering from seaward inshore. She was found to be laden with arms andu and ammunition and the crew had left her by the time she was boarded. Alter unloading the dhow, the 'Perseus 11 took her in tow and proceeded to Jashk, leaving her in charge of the Intelligence Officer there. Captain S.G.Craufurd, Gordon Highlanders. The arms and ammunition captured were destroyed with the exception of 1,435 Martini Met ford Rifles and Carbines (.303) which were retained in the Naval Ordnance Depot, Bombay, at the request of the Government of India. 6. - In addition to these independent captures a joint expedition in search of arms was carried out under the following circumstances 7. - On the 15th January 1910 the Senior Nav-al Officer, Persian Gulf, was informed by Major Austin, C.M.G., D.S.O., R.E., that 1,800 rifles were stored at Geigan. He obtained the loan of a detachment of the 117th Mahrattas from Jashk, where they embarked at Midnight, and on arrival off Geigan they landed together with 95 men from the 'Fox'. It was considered impossible to get a guide without the object of the expedition leaking out but the raid was nevertheless most ably and successfully carried out, though it involved most arduous work a considerable portion being performed in the dark hours. The arms and ammunition captured were destroyed. 8. - In view of the importance of suppressing the traffic in arms in these regions, and the difficulty and danger of this task my Lords consider it highly desirable that the Officers and men of the ships engaged in this task should be specially rewarded as in previous cases, and they have therefore proposed to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty*s1 ° Majesty s ireasury that awards should be made to the captors based on d5 per cent of the values of the dhows arms and ammunition, as assessed by His Majesty*s Consul at Muscat. 9. - As however the dhows arms and ammunition have in nearly every case been destroyed at the request of the Government of India on grounds of public policy instead of being sold as usual in ordinary Prize cases, and there are therefore no receipts to set against the cost of the proposed awards, Their Lordships of the Treasury consider that the Government of India might properly be asked for a contribution and that the views of the Secretary of State should be ascertained before an award is made. 10. - As regards the captures made by H.M.S. '‘Philomel”, I am to refer to Admiralty Letter of the 27th June 1910 M.4322, by which the Government of India was to bear the cost of running and maintaining the three ships 'Philomel', 'Odin' and 'Alert', including Full Pay, wages and liability for non-effective charges of ships' complements and to state that any award to the 'Philomel' would accordingly be reclaimed in due course. 11. - With respect to the captures by the other ships it appears to my Lords that there are strong grounds for asking for a contribution from Indian Funds and they would be glad to know whether in these and similar captures the Secretary of State would be prepared to authorise a grant equivalent at least to the breaking up value of the arms, and such further sum as may be agreed upon in respect of the ammunition. 12 # - I am also to enquire as to the disposal of the dhowsf CG dhows referred to in paragraphs 2 and 5 (ii) one of which was left in custody at Khor Fakan and the other in charge of the Intelligence Officer at Jashk, also of the arms captured by the 'Fox 11 on the 4th November 1909 and by the -A 'Perseus on the 25th May 1910 which have been retained in the Naval Ordnance Depot Bombay, and whether the Government of India will be prepared to make any contribu tion in respect of them. 13.- A list of the captures at present under consideration with their values as assessed by His Majesty's Consul at Muscat is enclosed.

The trade in modern arms and ammunition in the Persian Gulf seems first to have attracted the attention of the Government of India during the Afghan war of 1879-80, and in the year 1880 the first restrictive measures were taken, the Government of Bombay being instructed to abstain from granting licenses for the export of heavy consignments of arms and ammunition to Persian Gulf ports and to watch carefully the import of such articles at Karachi and on the coast to the westward. 2. In 1881 the Persian Government, who seem to have realised that the trade might have dangerous consequences for themselves, issued a Decree that “ no arms or munitions of war, such as guns, caps, gunpowder, &amp;c., should “ enter Persian territory without the permission of the Great Government.” In announcing the issue of this Decree to the British Legation, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote as Persian Decree, 1881. follows on the 3rd July 1881 : “ Since the J ^Thcmscm to Lord Granville, 12th “ r ig}jp 0 f purchasing arms and intro- u ^ ' “ ducing the same into Persia belongs to “ the Persian Government, who exercise it through their own specially appointed “ officials, and if this absolute right were not exclusively confined to the “ Government, and everybody who thought fit to do so were allowed to “ purchase such articles and introduce them into the country, this great “ governmental privilege would become obsolete, and considerable evils would result to the State. Therefore His Majesty the Shah has issued “ orders that no one shall import arms of any description whatsoever into “ this country from abroad, and any person in whose possession arms “ of foreign make are found will be liable to have them confiscated by “ Government.” 3. By a Proclamation dated the 3rd March 1891, the Sultan of Muskat Gwadur Prohibition, 1891. prohibited the import and export of (Appendix IY.) arms and ammunition at Gwadur, His 960/98. Highness’ dependency on the Mekran coast.The traffic thus became illegal along the whole littoral from the head of the Persian Gulf to the British border. * This prohibition was apparently inconsistent with the Sultan’s obligations under his commercial treaties (see paragraph 9 and footnote). But its propriety has never been challenged by any foreign Power. S. 16.9 4. As regards the measures taken by the Persian authorities to enforce the Decree of 1881, it may be noted that in May 1891 both the Shah himself ox x **xi, 1001 07 and the Amin-es-Sultan telegraphed to State of the tramc, lb91-y/. i ^ x-o u- i • • £ Sir M. Durand to Lord Salisbury, 10th the Governor of Bushire complaining of June 1898. the sale of arms m lehran by British and 2040/98. Parsee merchants, and giving strict orders that the prohibition on imports should be maintained, and all arms imported should be confiscated. In the year 1893 the local authorities seized seventeen cases of arms consigned to a Muscat firm, which were landed at Bushire for transhipment, on the ground that complaints had been received from the Turkish Government of arms being smuggledfrom Persian territory. The goods were confiscated. In the year 1895 the British steamer “ Zulu ” landed by mistake at the Bushire custom-house several cases of arms consigned to Muskat; these were seized by the local authorities. In January 1897, while the “ Zulu ” case was still pendmg, the first preventive officer was appointed at Bushire by the Persian Government. Apart from these incidents, there is nothing to show that effective measures were taken to prevent the smuggling of arms, and on the 15th April 1896, Sir M. Durand, in a Sir M. Durand to Lord Salisbury, 15th ( ] eS p a tch to Lord Salisbury, admitted Apnl 1896. that there could be “ little doubt that a “ considerable illicit import of arms into Persia is being carried on, and that “European firms are not wholly unconcerned in it.” The appointment of the Persian preventive officer seems to have made little difference to the traffic, and the number of rifles imported steadily increased, the great majority of the weapons being of British manufacture. 5. The principal merchants engaged in the traffic during this period were Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm of Bushire, a Persian Armenian firm under British protection, and Messrs. Fracis, Times, and Co., a_ Parsee and English house, whose first agency was established at Bushire in 1887, three years after Messrs. Malcolm began to import arms. 6. On the 30th March 1897 the Sultan of Muskat requested permission to Increase of import duty on arms at enhance the duty on arms and ammuni- Muskat. tion imported into Muskat from 5 per Government of India’s letter of 4th August cent., which was the duty fixed by his 1897. Commercial Treaties with Western 802/97. powers (see footnote to paragraph 9) in respect of all imports, to 7-|- per cent. The grounds alleged by His Highness for this proposal were that “ the continued import in large quantities of arms and ammunition is likely to cause serious trouble to ourselves ” (i.e., to Muskat). Her Majesty’s Government, being desirous of placing a check, however slight, on the traffic, suggested to France and the United States that the treaties might be modified so as to admit of the proposed enhancement. The United States Government expressed their willingness to fall in with the suggestion, and to approve the 74 per cent, duty “ whenever the Government “ of the Sultan should be in a position to collect such a tax generally from “ the other Treaty States trading with the country.” But the French Government objected to modifying the French Treaty of 1844, and the proposal was therefore abandoned. Shortly afterwards, however, the Sultan, on his own initiative, raised the duty on arms and ammunition to 6 per cent., at which figure it has since been maintained. There appears to have been no protest on the part of the dealers or of any foreign Government, though the increase of duty would seem to be an infringement of the French and American (as well as British) Commercial Treaties. 7. The tribal risings on the North-West Frontier of India during the year 1897 again brought the question to the front, the suggestion being madePersian Agreement, 1897. (Appendix Y.) Mr. C. Hardinge to Lord Salisbury, 5 th January 1898. 1775/98. that a part of the tribal armaments might have been derived from the Persian Gulf. In the same year (1897) it was decided to take up the question actively with the Persian Government, and at the close of the year the latter, , £&lt; . 1 as a result of British pressure, agreed that _ m addition to such measures as “ may be taken by Persian officials, Her &lt;£ i 8 ships should examine and search all merchant-vessels trading in &lt; { tl }? 1 e \ sl ™ G d llf ’ and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government a jl piohibited arms found on board.” The Grand Vizier’s note of the 18th December 1897, in which this Agreement was embodied, further stated that the Persian Government was ready “to join with Her Majesty’s Govern- “ ment m requesting the Sultan of Muskat to notify in the ports and “ territories of Muskat that arms should not be imported from that side into Peisia oi Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to “ search and confiscation the same rights in Muskat as in Persian waters.” 8 . The joint representations to the Sultan of Muskat were successful. The Sultan fell in with the suggestion that he should co-operate in the Muskat Agreement, 1898. suppression of the arms traffic, and on (Appendix VI.) the 13th January 1898, he issued (1) a Government of India’s letter of 10th Notification warning his subjects that February 1898. ^ the importation of arms and ammuni- 295/98. ^ £j on j n ^ 0 j nc q a an q Persia was illegal; and (2) a Proclamation authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, within Muskat territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Muskat flag, as well as Muskat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammunition intended for Indian and Persian ports. In his letter to the Resident agreeing to the issue of these documents, the Sultan said (13th January 1898) :—“ We have complied with it most willingly, “ and we associate with the British and Persian Governments in the arrange- “ ments that are made and that will be hereafter made for the suppression of “ this trade in arms and ammunition.” Power to search Muskat vessels on the high seas was obtained under the Sultan’s Notification of 17th October 1903, which had special reference to the export of arms from Muskat to the Somali Coast, and was issued at the instance of the British and Italian Governments. (See Appendix XL). In June 1898, with a view to placing a further check on the arms -o , . -d of traffic in Oman, rules were issued re- Muskat. quinng every British subject who (Appendix VIII.) “ now or hereafter has or becomes Government of India’s letter, 7th July “ possessed of any arms or ammunition 1898. ^ i n dominions of the Sultan of “ Muskat, or who imports any arms or ammunition into the said dominions” to furnish the British Consul “ without unreasonable delay” with a “ true and complete list and descrip tion ” of all such arms and ammunition; the lists and descriptions to be “ in such form as the said Consul may from time to time require.” 9 . It should be observed (1) that the right of search authorised by the Sultan’s prohibition applied only to Muskat Commercial Treaties. British, Persian, and Muskat vessels; (2) that the importation of arms into Muskat was not prohibited; and (3) that the export of arms from Muskat was only prohibited to two specified countries, viz., India and Persia. As regards (2) and (3) the Sultan u r as precluded by the terms of his Commercial Treaties with the United States (1833) and France (1844) (see Appendices I. and IP), and his “Commercial4 Declaration ” with Holland (1877), 0 from imposing, without the consent of the Treaty Powers, any general restriction upon the import of arms into his dominions or upon their export from Muskat, except to countries where importation was prohibited.t The position is further governed by the Declaration of the 10th March 1862, by which the British and French Governments engaged “reciprocally to respect the independence ” of the Sultans of Muskat and Zanzibar. (Appendix III). 10. On the 30th April 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein^, on the advice of the Bahrein Agreement, 1898. Resident in the Persian Gulf, agreed (Appendix VII.) absolutely to prohibit the importation Government of India’s letter of 7tli “ of arms into Bahrein territory or Inly 1898. “ exportation therefrom ” ; and to 711 / 98 - enforce the prohibition, he issued on the same dav— (1.) A Notification declaring that the import and export of arms into and from the Islands of Bahrein was absolutely forbidden, and that in future all arms and ammunition imported or exported would be seized and confiscated as property of the State. (2.) A Proclamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war permission to search vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Bahrein flag in Bahrein territorial waters, as well as Bahrein vessels in Indian or Persian waters, and to confiscate all arms and ammunition (weapons of war) intended for Indian or Persian ports, or for the Islands of Bahrein. 11. It was owing to the Agreement with the Sultan of Muskat that Her “ Baluchistan ” Case. Majesty’s ship “Lapwing” was able, “Times” Law Reports, 5tli July 1898 on the 24th January 1898, to seize the and 9tli July 1901. steamer “ Baluchistan,” near Muskat, and capture the cargo of arms she was carrying. An action was brought by Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., who had shipped a consignment of arms by the “ Baluchistan,” against the Sea Insurance Company, Limited, to recover a loss under a policy of marine insurance on the consignment. This loss the Company had refused to pay on two grounds : (1) That the plaintiffs had, when effecting the insurance, concealed a fact material to the estimation of the risk, viz., that the importation of arms was forbidden by Persian law ; and (2) that the adventure was illegal, as being in contravention to the law of nations^ Mr. Justice Bigham, in giving judgment for the plaintiffs, held that “the import of) arms was not illegal according to the law of Persia, as that law was administered in practice and enjoined,” or, in other words, that no real prohibition existed on the importation of arms into Persian ports. * the “ Commercial Declaration ” of 1877 merely provided for reciprocal “ most-favoured nation treatment between Holland and Muskat. It seems doubtful whether the terms of this instrument could be held to preclude the Sultan from placing a general embargo on the importation of arms into his territory. (See despatch from Her Maiesty’s Minister at the Hague, dated 3rd November 1897, 2323/97.) Ihe drench and American treaties, on the other hand, provide expressly for unrestricted importation of all kinds of merchandise. The American treaty makes [special mention of munitions of war (“ muskets, powder, and ball ”) which are to be “freely sold without anv restriction whatever at all the Sultan’s ports outside the Island of Zanzibar. (See Appendices I. and II.) r Ihe commercial Treaty of 1891 (which superseded an earlier Treaty of 183J) between the Sultan and Great Britain also contains a clause providing for the unrestricted import of all kinds of merchandise into Muskat territory. The British, drench, and Lnited States treaties all provide for the lew of a duty not exceeding 5 per cent, on all imports into Muskat. t It should be observed that on 17th October 1903 the Sultan of Muskat issued a Notification prohibiting the export of arms and ammunition from Oman to the portions of the African coast lying to the north of Cape Guardafui, which are under the British Protectorate, and also to those parts of the African coast which are under the Italian Protectorate, and granting British and Italian ships of war power to search Muskat vessels on the high seas and in Muskat territorial waters. (See Appendix XI.) + | l ie Sheikh of Bahrein had previously, on his own initiative, forbidden the import of arms, &amp;c., into his territory by a Notification issued in January 1896. (See Appendix VII. (3).)Among the underwriters who suffered loss in consequence of this decision were the .North China Insurance Company, Limited. This Company petitioned His Majesty’s Government in January 1902 (1932/02), and again in July 1906 (3280/06), to he compensated for their losses. The petition was refused on both occasions. As regards the legality of the act of seizure, the question was determined by the further action brought by Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., against Captain Can, R.M., the officer who had seized the L( Baluchistan,” for wrongful deprivation of property. Mr. Justice Grantham, who tried the case in the first instance, found for the defendant, and his judgment, after being reversed by the Court of Appeal, was finally upheld by the House of Lords, on the ground that the seizure had taken place in Muskat territorial waters, and was, under the Sultan’s Proclamation of January 1898, justifiable according to the law of Muskat. _ A third action was brought against Colonel Meade, Resident in the Persian Gulf, by Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp; Co., in respect of arms and ammunition seized at Bushire in December 1897, and at Bahrein in January 1898. Judgment was given for the defendant in May 1901. The effect of these proceedings was to reduce Messrs. Fracis, Times, &amp;Co., to bankruptcy ; and to impose, for the time being, a decided check on the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. 12. On the 1st January 1900 the Shah promulgated a law reaffirming the Persian Law of 1900. prohibition against the importation into Mr. Spring-Rice to Lord Salisbury, Persia of arms and ammunition, as well '28th May 1900. as various other commodities. The 2220/00. case 0 f gqg British steamer “ Hathor,” on board of which arms were seized at Bushire in November 1900, led to an Order in Council being issued, on the recommendation of the Law Officers of the Crown, by which the Persian Law of the 1st January 1900 was made applicable to British subjects, in so far as the provisions respecting arms and ammunition were concerned.

On the 24th May 1900 the Sheikh of Koweit entered into an agreement with the British Govern ment, by wdiich he engaged “ absolutely “ to prohibit the importation of arms “ into Koweit, or exportation there from.” To carry out this engagement, he issued on the same day (1) a Notification declaring that “ the importation “ of arms and ammunition into Koweit and the territory under my control, “ and the exportation of the same, are absolutely prohibited,” and that “ all “ arms and ammunition imported into any parts of Koweit territory, or “ exported therefrom, in future will be seized and confiscated ” ; (2)_ a Pro clamation conferring on British and Persian vessels of war the right to search, in Koweit territorial waters, vessels carrying the British, Persian, or Koweit flag, as well as Koweit vessels in Indian and Persian waters ; and to confiscate any arms and ammunition destined for Indian, Persian, or Koweit ports.

In a despatch dated the 30th July 1903 the Government of India recommended that, in order “to make the circle of the Gulf complete,” an endeavour should be made to come to an arrangement with Turkey per mitting vessels under the Turkish flag to be searched for arms by British ships of war, or, failing this, that the Porte should be asked to notify formally to His Majesty’s Government that the importation of arms into Ottoman dominions without special licence was prohibited. Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted on the matter, drew attention to the notifications 0 that had already been made by the Turkish Government on the subject, and suggested that they might sufficiently serve the purpose the Govern ment of India had in view. As regards the right of search, Sir N. O’Conor wrote “ In conversation with the Minister “ of Foreign Affairs, I gathered that the Turkish Government would be “ willing enough to co-operate in our endeavours to suppress the traffic in “ arms, but that the right to search Turkish vessels could only be conceded in exchange for a reciprocal privilege, an arrangement which, however “ one-sided it might prove in practice, would, in principle, be open to obvious “ objections.” Ihe question was accordingly allowed to drop, His Majesty’s Government accepting Sir Is. O Conor’s view as to the sufficiency of the notifications alleady made by the Turkish Government. (See also paragraph 62.) It should be added that no prohibition is in force in respect of the -gj Cl Ivati peninsula, which thus forms ' an exception to the “circle of the Giiir. I he political status of El Katr is peculiar, Turkish sovereio-nty being claimed by the Porte, but not recognised by His Majesty’s Government. See also paragraph 62. j* 16. In March 190-1 the Government of India proposed that the terms of theMuskat Proclamation of 1898 should be extended so as to cover the export of arms to Turkish ports, and to the territories of the Sheikhs of Bahrein n &lt; t i • n -r, . and Koweit, and of the Trucial Chiefs, as well as to Indian and Persian ports, which already fell within the scope of the 1 reclamation.

In the preceding paragraphs a brief summary has been given of the Situation at Muskat. p rlier dfiF ^ arms traffic in ‘ he 1 ersian C-ulf and of the measures taken with a view to its suppression. Speaking generally, it cannot be said that those measures were attended with much success. It was generally acknow ledged that the key to the question lay at Muskat, and that until that port was closed to the importation of arms it would be impossible to place any effective check on the export trade by native dhows to other ports on the Gulf littoral. Owing, however, to the terms of the Sultan’s commercial treaties (see paragraph 9), the importation of arms into His Highness’s dominions could not be prohibited without the consent of the French Government, a consent which there appeared to be small likelihood of obtaining.| Meanwhile the import trade from Europe to Muskat rapidly increased. According to figures supplied by the British Customs authorities, the number of rifles imported from Great Britain, which was then the main source of supply, rose from 5,435 in 1898 to 13,831 in 1900. The total number of rifles imported into Muskat from all sources in 1900-01 was declared by the Muskat Customs to be 25,000. The figure declined to 17,000 in 1901-02, and in the following year (1902-03) there was also a decrease. But in 1901-05, “ in spite of the fact that the local Oman market had long since been glutted,” the number of rifles imported from all quarters was estimated at not less than 20,000 ; in 1906-07 the numbers rose to 44,927, and in 1907-08 to 87,680. In 1908-09 the number of imported rifles was returned at 85,820. The above figures, it should be observed, are based for the most part on statistics furnished by the Muskat Customs authorities, and it is not possible to vouch for their accuracy. The same remark applies to the figures given below of the values of the arms and ammunition imported into Muskat. The table below was included by the Government of India in their despatch of the 2nd September 1909, as giving the “most reliable figures” which they had been able to obtain. It will be seen that as regards imported rifles, the figures given in this table are somewhat smaller than those given above. * In view of the support rendered by the Turks to Abdul Aziz bin Rashid, Amir of bTejd, one of the warring chiefs in the interior, the Government of India (telegrams of 20th and 29th May 1904) considered that no additional check should, for the time being, be imposed on the arms traffic at Koweit, which was the main source of supply to the rival chieftain, Abdul Aziz bin Saoud, Amir of the Wahabi. This view was approved by His Majesty’s Government on the 24th June 1904. t In their despatches of 29th January and 30th July 1903, the Government of India urged that the French Government should be approached with a view to obtaining their consent to the prohibition of the importation of arms and ammunition into Muskat. On the 1st October 1903 Lord Lansdowne suggested informally to the French Minister in London that the British and French Governments might cooperate in inducing the Sultan to expel M. Goguyer (see paragraph 18) and to put a stop to the arms traffic. M. Geoffray returned a guarded answer, and nothing further seems to have come of the suggestion.8 Table contained in Government of India s letter, 2nd September 1909. Year.

From other sources of information, however, they considered it highly probable that the numbers given represented “only a proportion, perhaps not more than 50 per cent., of the real exports to the Mekran coast.” As regards the origin of these arms, the Government of India calculated in February 1907 that, whereas in 1899-1900 only about one seventh of the imports came from France, by 1905 the proportion of French arms had risen to two-fifths.| As regards the years 1906-07, 1907-08, and 1908-09, the figures are given in the following table. It will be seen that about 53|- per cent, of the arms imported in 1906-07, about 51J per cent, of those imported in 1907-08, and about 50| per cent, in 1908-09, were of Belgian manufacture, the percentage of English-made rifles for the corresponding years being about 38, 34, and 30 : — Rifles imported into Muskat J :— 1906-07. 1907-8. 1908-09.

Goguyer, a French merchant, who established M. Goguyer. himself at Muskat in March 1899, and informed the local Indian merchants, on his arrival, that his operations w 0 uld be exempt from British interference, as he would export arms purchased from him in dhows flying the French flag. M. Goguyer, from time to time, lent large sums of money to the bultan of Muskat. Gom- nlaints as to M. Goguyer’s conduct were more than once made to the krencii Government, who, however, did not _ see their way to interfere. On the 1st October 1903 the French Minister m London V M. Geoff ray), m leply to representations from Lord Lansdowne, fully admitted that M. Goguyer was a “ very troublesome personage,” but said that he had friends in the 1 lench Chamber, and that it might not be very easy to bring about his expulsion from Muskat. A somewhat similar reply was returned bj the Poiitmal Director of the French Foreign Office 3270 / 07 - to complaints made on the 1st July 1907 bv the British Embassy in Paris. M. Louis, after remarking that M. Goguyer was a “terrible thorn in the flesh for the Quai d Orsay, promised that he s. 16 . C 1 iwould do all in his power to put a stop to his &lt;£ objectionable activity.” He added, however, that M. Goguyer had proved in the past a “ very difficult person to deal with.” In September ^ ' 1907 M. Laronce, French Consul at Muskat, furnished his Government with proofs of M. Goguyer’s participation in the illicit traffic, and informed the Political Agent that he had instructions to give all possible assistance in preventing the export of arms to prohibited localities.M. Goguyer died at Muskat on the 16th October 1909. Another French merchant, M. Caracalla, “ encouraged by the success of his pre decessor,” visited Muskat in July 1906, with the apparent object of taking- part in the arms trade. M. Caracalla again visited Muskat in November 1907, and his name and those of MM. Goguyer, Baijeot, and Kevorkoff were included in a list furnished by the Political Agent in the same month of French subjects engaged in the traffic (Major Grey to Government of India, 2nd November 1907, 2114/07). _ ^ * The main effect of the restrictions imposed upon British Indian traders at Muskat on the 27th June 1898 {see paragraph 8 and Appendix VIII.) seems to have been to throw the trade to an increasing extent into foreign hands. Restrictions on British dealers. The question of cancelling these restric- tions was raised by the Government or India, at the instance of the Political Agent, Muskat,| and the Resident in the Persian Gulf, in their despatch of 30th July 1903. “ So long as the trade 1112/03 &lt;£ continues,” they wrote, “ it is desirable “ that, so far as possible, it should “ remain in the hands of British subjects rather than that it should pass to “ French firms, and that business at Muskat should thus become more “ profitable than ever to M. Goguyer and his fellows. We realise that the regulations in question must tend to place British traders at a disadvantage compared with their rivals of other nationalities, and we are inclined to “ think that this consideration more than outweighs the advantage of the “ limited degree of control which the rules secure,” His Majesty’s Govern ment decided, however, that no action should be taken at the time, pending the result of a reference which had been made to the French Government on the general subject {see paragraph 17, footnote). The question was again raised by the Government of India in a despatch dated the 18th August 1904 (1564/04); and again in their despatch of 21st February 1907, see para graph 32 (4). On the latter occasion His Majesty’s Government decided (Despatch to Government of India, 31st May 1907) that the restrictions should be maintained pending the meeting of the Brussels Arms Conference in April 1908. It should be added that on the 5th May 1909 the Foreign Office informed Messrs. Ivynoch that there v T as no likelihood of any relaxation of the regulations issued in June 1898. 19. As regards the ultimate destination of the arms and ammunition imported into Muskat, the Government of India, in their Despatch of 30th July 1903, expressed the view that “ the existence of any considerable traffic with the African seaboard has not been established, and it seems probable that * The results of M. Laronce’s co-operation were satisfactory. On 18th November 1907 Majoi Giej lepoited that the Sultan of Muskat had forbidden the Arab arms merchants to sell aims and ammunition to Afghans in future, and that the French Consul had also issued a circular to the arms dealers connected with his administration forbidding sale to Afo-hans. Paities of Afghans who subsequently arrived a,t Muskat with the intention of purchasing arms and ammunition were compelled by the Sultan to return to Karachi. t Among the enclosures to this despatch was a petition, dated the 3rd March 1903 from certain British Indian arms dealers at Muskat to the Political Agent. The petitioners stated that the result of the restrictions imposed in 1898 had been “ to drive the trade from the hands of your petitioners and to thrust it upon other adventurers, who‘are day by day “ getting firmly established in the trade as manifested by monthly reports. It is now only ' t he French firms who import every month two-thirds of the whole cargo. Had it not “ b , ee11 for tbe existence of such restrictions upon your petitioners, they make bold to say that ‘ they would never have allowed themselves to be elbowed out by the French, Greeks and “ Arabs as they have been at present. It is only this advantage—complete freedom to de’al in arms—which has given a footing to the French to establish themselves here commercially.” The petitioners therefore prayed to be released from the weekly registration of arms and ammunition, and to be placed on an equal footing with traders of other nationalities.cult ita at 11 I! tlie consignments eventually find their way into the interior of Oman, to the Arab and Turkish coasts, and to the Persian seaboard, whence it is ‘‘ certain that a proportion reach the tribes on the north-west frontier of “ India.” Some four years later, in February 1907, the Government of India reported that further experience had confirmed their view that “no “ traffic in arms worth considering is carried on between Muskat and the ^ African seaboard.“ On the other hand,” they wrote, “there can be no “ doubt that by far the greater part of the arms landed at Muskat leave “ again by sea, and that Muskat has now earned the reputation of being the “ arms depot of the entire Middle East.” 20. As regards the situation on the Persian Coast it may be said generally Situation on Persian Coast. that the measures adopted by the Persian -.nr^/rw. authorities have had little or no effect in ^ . stopping the traffic. Mr. Grant-Duff, British Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, wrote in July 1906: “ There is no “ present likelihood of the Persian Government taking the slightest trouble “ to put an end to it. Even if they desired to do so, 1 doubt if they have the “ power.” The Government of India have from time to time done what they could to check the trade at the Persian ports. In 1900, a Vice-Consul was appointed to Bunder Abbas, where “ it was hoped that the presence of a British officer “ might lead to the display of greater vigour in the repression of the illicit “ importation of arms along the neighbouring portions of the Persian coast.” In 1902, measures were concerted with the Persian Governor-General of Mekran to prevent the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan, and to impose restrictions on their possession in that province. A further conference on the subject took place between the Persian officials on the Mekran border and the British frontier officers in 1906, leading to the conclusion of an agreement signed at Karwan on the 26th May 1906, by which thirteen “headmen and greybeards” of the ports of Persian Baluchistan engaged to hold themselves responsible for stopping the importation of arms and ammu nition. The agreement was countersigned by Captain McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, by the Persian Governor of Baluchistan, by Sirdar Said Khan, of Rapch, who described himself as holding the Nizamat of Persian Mekran, by the Customs Mudir of Chahbar, and by a representative of the Persian Foreign Office. (See Appendix XII.) The desire to cope with the illegal traffic in arms was also one of the reasons which led, in the same year (1906), to the temporary appointment (since discontinued) of a Vice- Consul at Bam. But little advantage could be expected from the co-operation of Persian officials, who, whatever their intentions might be, had not the means of interfering effectively with the trade. Lieutenant G. D. Ogilvie, who travelled through Persian Baluchistan in , ' June 1906, on his way to take up his ' J '' duties as Vice-Consul at Bam, reported that the local Persian authorities were quite incapable of dealing with the traffic, and that the Afghans! employed in smuggling arms up country from the coast were invariably w T ell armed, and could overcome any opposition offered to them with the greatest ease. The same view w r as expressed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, in his Annual Administration Report for 1906-07. “There is little doubt,” he wrote, “ that the three chiefs in charge of the coastal portion of the Karwan * On the other hand, the Colonial Office in March 1909, expressed the view that the effect of the arms traffic at Muskat on the position in Somaliland “ cannot be overlooked, as the « ]q u il a h draws some of his supplies from this source, and one of his dhows was recently “ captured by an Italian man-of-war while on its way from Illig ” to Muskat, (Colonial Office to Foreign Office, 13th March 1909, 3118/09). t Prior to 1903 arms for Afghanistan and the Indian frontier were mainly purchased at Bunder Abbas, and conveyed thence by the annual autumn caravans of Afghan merchants. In 1903-04 a’ direct trade, for the purpose of carrying arms and ammunition only, was organised by the Afghans, the arms being landed on the Persian Mekran coast, where they were met by Afghans with camels.12 “ district are perfectly powerless, even collectively, to prevent Afghans from “ landing arms on the coast. Large numbers of Afghans receive the “ consignments on the beach, and are well prepared to resist any local “ interference.” It should be added that there is little reason to doubt that the Sirdars of Persian Baluchistan have a pecuniary interest in the trade.' 1 ' Moreover, the nature of the country is such that, once the consignments isso/oe arms are l^ n( led and clear of the coast, it is virtually impossible to catch the caravans conveying them into the interior. In this connection a letter written by Lieutenant Ogilvie in August 1906 may be quoted :—“ The com- “ munications in Baluchistan are so unspeakably badf that large caravans, “ when once they have left the coast, can travel without any fear of “ interference, even if such interference were contemplated, by the autho- “ rities, and with the utmost secrecy. The true facts of the case are that the “ authorities have no power to do anything. When once past Bampur the “ smugglers have only to avoid Khwash, where is a Hakim with three “ soldiers, and they have a clear space, practically uninhabited as far as “ Seistan.” 21. Mr. Grant Duff, in July 1906, thought it possible that when the five Attitude of Belgian Customs Officials. launches then under construction at Bombay for the Persian Government, had been supplied to the Customs Department, “ something may be done by the Belgian | officialsJ to check the arms traffic.” These launches were supplied during 1906-07, but they seem to have had no appreciable effect upon the trade. The attitude of the Belgian officials towards the trade at that time may 1388/06. illustrated by an incident reported by Lieutenant C. T. Daukes, Consul at Seistan, in June 1906. On the 1st May 1906 the British Consul received information that a caravan carrying rifles and accompanied by armed Afghans had started inland from the Gulf, together with details of its probable route through Persian territory to the Afghan frontier. M. Cattersel, the local Director of Customs, w T as at once urged to take steps to apprehend the caravan, but, under considerable pressure, declined to do more than give a vague promise Brat he would offer a reward for its seizure. On the 11th May new r s was received of the near approach of the caravan, and M. Cattersel was again urged to make some attempt to intercept it. Nothing was done, however, and on the 28th May the caravan was reported to have passed through to Band-i-Kamal Khan on the Helmund. In the words used bv Mr. Daukes in reporting the incident, “ ample warning was given, even the “ route of the caravan was correctly gauged ; and yet, in spite of the facilities thus afforded them (i.e., the Belgian officials), no steps were taken.” On the British side of the Perso-Baluch border preventive measures Preventive measures in British Bain- Y 61 *® f^Opted with SOUie success.

In April 1908, in view of the numbers and strength of the arms caravans, the military detachment at Kobat* was reinforced by 500 infantry for a period of four months. This force formed a cordon along the Perso-Baluch frontier from near Mashki Shah to Robat, but was not allowed to operate inside Persian territory. The result was to prevent any arms caravans crossing the portion of British territory lying between Persia and Afghanistan, the only caravan that attempted to cross this tract withdrawing hastily on finding the road blocked. But this success brought with it no appreciable advantage. As Sir H. McMahon, Sir H. McMahon to Government of ■ 1° ^ Cto^mor-General d India, 24th October 1908.

A few words may be said about the state of the trade at other ports in the Gulf. At Ivoweit, in spite of the Sheikh’s agreement in 1900 (see paragraph 13 Situation at Koweit. and Appendix IX.), little senous attempt 1673/03 seems to have been made to check the import of arms. In May 1906, Major Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, found it necessary formally to remind Sheikh Mubarak of his prohibition, and to request that it might be more strictly enforced. The Sheikh did not take the reminder in good part, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf gave his opinion that the question was one which might at any time endanger the good relations between the Sheikh and the Political Agent. Major Knox put the case still more strongly in a letter to the Resident- “ The Proclamation,” he wrote on the 3rd July 1906, “is not worth the paper it is written on, and is only a cause of friction.” The latest reports point to a large and increasing traffic at Koweit.f It is noteworthy that in October 1908 Sheikh Mubarak is reported to have “ twice despatched in his steam launch large quantities of arms and “ ammunition to his friend Sheikh Khazal ” (of Mohammerah). The action taken by the British India Steam Navigation Company in 1907 to check the smuggling of arms in the Company’s steamers seems to have had little effect beyond increasing importations into Koweit by country craft. Representations were made by the Italian Government in March 1908 (on information received from the nakhoda ° of an Arab dhow, the “ Fath-el-Rahman,” chartered by an Italian merchant at Hodeida) as to the alleged smuggling of arms from Muskat to Koweit by a British steamer in the previous summer. The Italian Government, in bringing the case to notice, dwelt on the “ necessity “ of taking steps in order that the Bay of Muskat may not become a centre “ for the traffic of arms with Somaliland.” Enquiries were made by the ■ ^ Government of India which showed the 1887/08. facts to be that the British India Com pany’s steamer “ Dwarka,” on arrival at Mohammerah from Bushire on the 5th September 1907, was found to have on board a certain number of unclaimed suspicious cases.

At the Sultan’s request, the articles were transferred to one of his representatives, and afterwards appear to have keen restored to the original owners, certain local arms dealers, who subsequently engaged a number of dhows (including the “ Fath-el-Rahman ”) to transport these and other arms to Koweit. The Italian Government were informed accordingly on the 29th October 1908. 24. At Bahrein the effect of the prohibition of April 1898 (see paragraph 10 _ . and Appendix VII.) was at once per- Situation a,j Bahiem. ceptible in the Customs returns, the total value of the imports of arms and ammunition, which had amounted to 30,849Z. in 1897, falling to 313Z. in the following year. In October 1905 the Sheikh of Bahrein addressed a memorial to the Government of , India, in which, among other alleged grievances, he complained of the fact that he was obliged to interdict the sale of arms, and was thereby deprived of an advantage enjoyed by all the Arab Chiefs along the Arabian coast. He was informed in reply, in May 1906, that the restric tion on the importation of arms at Bahrein had first been imposed in 1895 by himself on his own initiative, and his attention was drawn to the measures he had himself spontaneously taken from time to time to stop the traffic. It was also pointed out to him that the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast had similarly prohibited the traffic of arms in their territory, and he was given to understand that the Government of India would not consider for a moment the possibility of cancelling or modifying the Agreement he had concluded with the British Government on this point. Nevertheless, there is every reason to believe that a considerable amount of illicit arms traffic has gone on at Bahrein. In December 1906 the Resident in the Persian Gulf furnished evidence that the port was rapidly rising to importance as a centre of the trade, and that the arms business, hitherto confined to one dealer, had been taken over by a Company, two of the shareholders being friends of the Sheikh himself and opponents of Customs reform.^ In the Persian Gulf Administration Report for the year 1906-0/, the Resident noted that Bahrein was u quickly establishing its “ reputation as a convenient entrepot for the distribution of arms through the small ports of the Persian littoral.” Later reports indicated that signs of the illicit traffic were less apparent at Bahrein during the years 1907 and 1908. But there was no reason to suppose that it had ceased to exist. -o.

J ’that arms and ammunition of modern pattern (European manufacture) were reaching the tribesmen, apparently via Muskat and the Persian Gulf. Thus, on the 30th July 1906 the Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Piovince reported that a large number of Martini-Henry carbines had recently found their way into tribal territory. These rifles, he remarked, had been for sale m Afghanistan during the previous winter, and a considerable number had been purchased by independent tribesmen at prices ranging from Rs. 150 to Rs. 200. He added that the appearance of the carbines had been noticed almost simultaneously amongst the Mohmands in Tirah and (( othei parts' of the Khyber Agency, on the Ivurram border, and in “ aziristan.” The weapons were said to be part of a very large consignment fiom the Gulf for Russian Central Asia, which had been stopped by the Afghan authorities at Herat. The arms were then sent to Kabul for the Amir s orders, and were finally distributed by sale. All accounts, in fact, tended to show that the arming of the tribesmen in independent territory with modern weapons was proceeding briskly with results that were described by the Government of India in their Despatch of the 21st February 1907 as “ constituting a grave menace to the peace of the border.” As_ regards the actual number of rifles (derived from all sources, including local manufacture) in the possession of the tribesmen, the Government of India estimated in February 1907 that, out of 270,000 men belonging to the frontier tribes, 94,000 possessed breech-loading rifled arms. The latest information available gives the figures on the 30th April 1909 as follows:—Total fighting strength of tribesmen, 334,005 ; breech loading rifles or carbines, 152,426 ; muzzle-loading rifles, 56,943A Sec also paragraph 41 (2). Situation in Afghanistan: attitude of Amir. 26. As regards Afghanistan, the Government of India reported early in 1907 that they had recently received the “ disquieting intelligence ” that a number of rifles had reached the Herat and Kandahar districts, and were being freely sold among the tribesmen with the approval of the local Afghan officials. The Government of India added that “ the trade in these arms is no longer prohibited by the Amir in “ accordance with the policy pursued by his father, and His Majesty is “ reported to have stated openly that he has no objection to the acquisition “ of weapons of precision by his subjects, and to have rewarded some of the principal men engaged in the trade.” In August 1908 it was reported that the Amir had granted general permission to Afghan traders to bring arms and ammunition from the Persian Gulf, and had authorised advances to respectable traders for the purpose; and subsequent reports have furnished further evidence of His Majesty’s desire to promote the trade in every way. An illustration of his attitude was afforded by the protest which he addressed to the Viceroy on the 11th l^Vicerey’s telegram of 16th October geptember 19 07 against the action of 1792/07. th® British authorities in stopping an Afghan arms caravan in Kacha Gorge in the previous May.f His Majesty complained of this seizure on the ground that the arms were being brought for the purpose of arming the people of Afghanistan, and expressed the hope that the British frontier officials would be punished, and steps taken to prevent such action in the future. The caravan, it should be noted, was actually over the border in British territory at the time of its capture. * These figures are taken from the latest edition (corrected up to 30th April 1909) of the “ Statement of fighting strengths and armament of independent Tribes on the North-West Frontier,” prepared by the Indian Intelligence Department. t The caravan was ambushed by a party under Major Webb-Ware, Political Agent, Chagai. The Afghans scattered to the surrounding hills, leaving 795 rifles and nearly 67,000 rounds of ammunition behind them. Over 70 of their camels were either killed or captured.16 1908 1908. 1759/08. It was suggested by the Secretary of State for India, in August 1908, that advantage might be derived from a Lord Morley’s Despatch, 14th August &lt;&lt; f r i e ndly interchange of views ” with the Amir, in which it could be pointed out that, if arms were required for “arming the people of Afghanistan ” with His Majesty’s permission, some other means might be devised for obtaining them which would not “ involve “ the traffic through Persia with the tribes on our side of the line, or the “ risk of violent conflicts in Persia between his own and British subjects.” This suggestion did not commend itself Viceroy’s telegram of 19th September ^ ^] ie Government of India. They ex plained that their information placed it beyond doubt that the traffic was approved by the Amir; the arms were imported free of duty, and the trade at Kabul had been “openly encouraged by Nasrulla and the Afghan authorities.” The Amir, the Government of India observed, considered himself entitled to import arms under the Durand Agreement of 12th November 1893, Article 7 of which laid down that the Government of India would “raise no objection to the purchase and import by His Highness of munitions of war.” This view had been formally accepted by Sir L. Dane, the British Commissioner at Kabul, in March 1905. The Amir evidently preferred to let arms reach his country through Persia. In the circumstances, the Government of India thought it would be “impolitic to raise this question just now.” The proposal to address the Amir was not pressed. But the subject was revived early in 1909, when the Secretary of State, onq ° ld Morley s Des P atc K * ebruary j n a despatch to the Government of 28505/09. India dated the 5th February 1909, raised the question whether the Amir was aware of the engagements of His Majesty’s Government with Persia and Muskat in regard to the arms traffic, and suggested that when the time came for addressing the Afghan Government “ on the increasing dangers and “ obstacles to telegraphic communications (see below, paragraph 37) which “ the proceedings of his subjects involve,” it wmild be well to explain to the Amir the nature of our engagements and “ our obligation to fulfil duties “ which, more than ten years ago, v'ere entrusted to us by the governments “ immediately concerned.” 27. It remains to notice the measures taken to suppress the arms traffic Naval Measures in the Gulf. ™ th ? rersi p ^ulf by the subsidised vessels of the East Indies Squadron. The question of checking the trade by intercepting dhows on their way across the Gulf was carefully considered by the naval authorities in the won ter of 1905-06. But Admiral Poe, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, who visited the Gulf in person, reported to the Admiralty that he saw little hope of the traffic being suppressed by the British war vessels on the station, which were too large and drew r too much water for the purpose, especially as their whereabouts must always be 'well known and their movements were carefully watched by the Arabs. During the following season - ' (1906-07) increased efforts were made by His Majesty s ships to cope with the trade, but their endeavours were for the most part unsuccessful. By the end of the season the naval officers who had taken the^ largest share in the operations were satisfied of the practical impossibility of checking the arms trade by sea. inn« S re ff rdS th f duratiQnot the arms traffic “season,” Captain Somerville, R.IST reported m JO , as the result of his observations, that the season of transporting arms across the Gulf extended from November to March. The latest available administration report on the Persian Gulf shows that m 1J08, a certain number of shipments were made during the months of Mav to October though during the height of the summer (June, July, and August), the amount transported was very small. As regards the traffic inland. Major Kennion stated in 1907 that ^Of/OG^ ' 11 ” season as regards these parts (Seistan) begins in March and ends in July.”28.

New, Assistant Superintendent of the Indo-European Ielegraph Department at Jask (since appointed Vice-Consul at Lingah), who organised a system of intelligence along the coast by means of telephones and special watchmen to co-operate with His Majesty’s ships. It may be added that in the following winter (November 1907) the Government of fndia adopted a series of measures, at Mr. New’s suggestion, for dealing with the tiattic on the Mekran coast. Phese measures included the creation of a small corps of camel sowars to patrol the coast between Jask and Chahbar, in order to collect information about the movements of Afghans, expected consignments of arms, &amp;c., for communication without delay to British ships engaged in the suppression of the trade. The value of Mr. New’s work in this connection was fully recognised by the Naval Commander-in-Chief (Admiral Slade), who, in a report dated the 7th May 1909, expressed great appreciation of the “ excellent and reliable service of intelligence,” which Mr. New had organised. Disposal of captured arms. Lord George Hamilton’s Despatch of 9th November 1900. 248/00. 29. One point in connection with naval operations requires special notice. In a Despatch dated the 26th July 1900 the Government of India raised the question of the disposal of arms and ammunition captured from dhows by Her Majesty’s ships under the agreement with Muskat, In reply Her Majesty’s Government laid down the general principal that “ confiscated arms . . . should be handed over to the Government within whose territories they were seized ” (Letter from Foreign Office to India Office, 29th October 1900); and the Government of India were informed that “ arms seized by the British authorities under “ powers derived from the Government of Muskat should be handed over to “ the Government on whose behalf and within whose jurisdiction they were “seized” (Lord George Hamilton to Government of India, 9th November 1900). The same principle vras reaffirmed by His Majesty’s Government two years later, when Lord George Hamilton informed the Government of India, in a Despatch dated the 11th April 1902, that “ the Sultan of Muskat is un- “ doubtedly entitled under his agreement to any arms that may be seized “ by His Majesty’s ships in Muskat waters, or in a Muskat vessel outside the “ territorial waters of any other Power.” Similarly, as regards Persia, His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran w T as informed that “any seizures made by “ British ships of war in the territorial waters of Persia or in Persian boats “ outside their limits and not within the territorial waters of another country “ should be held to be confiscated for and in the interest of the Persian “ Government ” (Lord Lansdowne to Sir A. Hardinge, 24th March 1902). Lord George Hamilton’s Despatch of 11th April 1902. v 1944/02. 30. The following summary of the general situation in respect of the arms traffic in 1907 is taken from a General Summary of situation, 180 o Memorandum drawn up under the instructions of the Government of India in connection with the Persian Gulf Gazetteer : — “The present situation is therefore as follows. Since 1902 the arms traffic has been nominally prohibited at every port, except Muskat, in the Gulfs of Persia and Oman ;*but smuggling and connivancy at breaches of the law are so universally prevalent that arms and ammunition continue to be distributed from Muskat over the length and breadth of the Gulf region, and * With the exception of the El Katr peninsula (see paragraph 15).18 a brisk trade in arms lias sprung up between Muskat and Afghanistan. The importations at Muskat, though the small local demand of the Oman Sultanate must long since have been satisfied, are still on the same scale as before the general prohibition of the trade in 1902'; but they now represent the whole, or nearly the whole, instead of a part only of the trade. It has been proved, at the cost of an immense expenditure of energy by British establishments, that the illegal dissemination of arms from the free port of Muskat cannot be prevented, or even appreciably hindered by naval means ; also that measures, however efficacious, taken in British Baluchistan do not and cannot influence the course of the Afghan traffic; while officers who have studied the question on the spot in Persia agree that the Government of that country are incapable, however much they may desire to do so, of putting down the trade across Persia between Muskat and Afghanistan.” III. Events in 1907-09: The Brussels Arms Conference, 1908-09. Proposal to approach French Go vernment. Government of India’s letter, 21st February 1907. 473/07. 31. In a despatch dated the 21st February 1907 the Government of India drew attention to the formidable pro portions which the illicit arms traffic in the Persian Gulf was assuming. They pointed out the injurious effects that were already being produced in Persian and Turkish territory, where the authority of the respective Governments had already been, to a great extent, undermined, and referred to the “luxuriant crop of difficulties ,r that would be created on the North-West Frontier of India and in Afghanistan il the facilities enjoyed by the tribesmen for obtaining modern arms and ammunition were not checked. They estimated that out of the 270,000 men belonging to the frontier tribes more than one third possessed breech-loading rifled arms {see paragraph 25); and added that so great was the trade in such arms, “ and so completely is it beyond our control, that the time may come within the next few r years when every fighting man will possess a “ modern weapon.” As legards remedial measures, the Government of India were convinced that nothing could be hoped for from the Persian Government. “ We regard it as certain,” they wrote, “ that effective action for the suppression of^the aims trade cannot be taken by the Persian authorities. On the coast, the Belgian customs officials are few m number, and although, perhaps, willing ^ to give assistance for the suppression of the traffic, they have not the means at their disposal really to take efficient measures to deal with the ^ e^ il. Inland, as is well known, the Persian authorities are powerless outside the tov ns, and laige caravans can travel by unfrequented routes without “ the slightest risk of interference.” In these ciicumstances the Government of India arrived at the conclusion that the arms traffic would continue to flourish and increase until an agreement was arrived at with E ranee, and a complete prohibition enlorced against the importation of arms and ammunition into the territories or the feultan of Muskat. “If the Muskat emporium could be closed,” tiev wrote, the necessity for resorting to other expedients, which u n at Y eSt e MT nsive makeshifts for the prevention of the trade, would u be lar gely obviated, and it might be hoped that the trade would « automatically cease, not only m the direction of Afghanistan and India, i round the Persian Gulf, as it would be much more difficult for arms- &lt;£ ^ smuggM into the Gulf ports from Jibuti, though we should prefer that the regulations at that port also regarding the arms traffic should be made much more stringent.”. 0 ' J ' ;^ e 1 ^ overnm Gnt of India realised tiiat, for diplomatic reasons, His Majesty s Government had hitherto considered it advisable to defer making any request to the F rench Government in regard to the arms trade, but they hoped that the present moment might be regarded as a propitious*' one for taking action in the matter. They suggested that, in approaching the r rench Government, (1) the nature and far-reaching consequences ” of the evil might be explained to them, “ as they are probably not fully known except to ourselves and to' the other countries that suffer ” ; and (2) it might be pointed out that British trade would stand to lose more heavily even than French by the proposed prohibition, more than half the traffic being still in English hands. As proposals of secondary importance, “ which should certainly not be Subsidiary proposals. “ flowed to delay action on what we regard as the vital question of stopping the trade at Muskat, the Government of India recommended :— (1.) I hat the Muskat Proclamation of 1898 (see paragraph 8 and Appendix k I.) should be revised in such a manner as to cover the export of arms from Muskat, not only to Indian and Persian ports, but also to any port whatever in the Persian Gulf.| (2.) That the Muskat Proclamation should be amended so as to enlarge our powers in regard to the seizure of arms. (3.) That the Turkish Government should be asked to allow British ships of war, “ whether in Koweit waters or in Turkish territorial waters in the Persian Gulf outside the Shatt-el-Arab,” to search vessels suspected of carrying arms, including those flying the Turkish flag. (4.) That, “ in the event, which we trust is unlikely, of its being found “ impossible to concert measures with France for complete abolition “ of the arms trade in the near future,” the restriction placed upon British subjects in Muskat in June 1898 (see paragraph 8 and Appendix VIII.) should be removed, “so as to secure the arms trade remaining, as far as possible while it exists, in the hands “ of British subjects.” 33. In reply to their Despatch of 21st February 1907, the Government of Mr. Morley’s Despatch, 29th March India were mformed^ on the 29th March 1907. ' 1907 that His Majesty’s Government 473/07. did no t consider the present moment opportune for making representations to the Powers concerned, but were of opinion that the better course would be “ to continue for the present the “ collection of information and statistics with a view to bringing the various “ recommendations made by the Government of India before the Arms “ Conference which is to assemble at Brussels early in 1908.” 34. It was hoped that the object in view might be achieved as a result „ . . ^ . OAO of the Brussels International Arms Brussels Arms Conference, 1908. Conference by some arrangement for bringing Muskat within the scope of the General Act of the Brussels Convention of 1890,£ under which the traffic in arms is prohibited on the * It was pointed out that considerable concessions had been made to 1 ranee in the negotiations arising out of the Hague Arbitration Award of 1904 (respecting the use of the French flag by Muskat dhows), and that a settlement of this question satisfactory to the French G-overnment appeai-ed to be within sight. J' This was a revival of the proposal made by the Government of India in 1904 (see above, paragraph 16). The Government of India pointed out that the reasons, based on the state of tribal affairs in Central Arabia, which caused the proposal to be dropped in 1904, no longer held good in 1907, as the Wahabi Amir had established so strong a position as to be independent of indii’ect aid. J The Brussels Act of 1890 requires any one of the signatory Powers that has occasion to authorise the traffic in arms in territories of its own lying within the regions affected by the provisions of the Act, to establish a “ public warehouse,” under the control of its local adminis tration, in which all imported arms must be deposited, and from which they may not be withdrawn without the previous authorisation of the administration.East African coast South of Lat. 20 N. The difficulty in regard to such an arrangement, from the point of view of His Majesty s Government, lay in the question of providing machinery for carrying out the pro visions of the Brussels Act without admitting a system of international , o ^ i? 'u To-ntr control which would he inconsistent 19 oJ lceroys teegram ° 1K e 1U ‘ 3 with British political predominance at 263/08. Muskat. The views of the Government of India on this point were stated in the Viceroy’s telegram of 2nd February 1908. “Could we not,” th^y asked, “ before the Conference meets, induce “ France, if not any other Bowers having commercial treaties with Muskat, “ to agree to amendment of treaties and prohibition of the import of aims,^ as “ the Bower most interested ? We would meet the cost of compensating “ Sultan, and in return for this might induce him, with consent of France, to “ entrust customs management to us, or at any late to appoint a British “ officer as Superintendent of Customs. Failing an arrangement of this kind, it was recognised that the question of the Bersian Gulf traffic might have to come before the Conference for full discussion, m which case it was held that the object of His Majesty s Govern ment should be to minimise, as far as possible, the danger of foieign interference at Mnskat. As regards the actual control of the traffic at Muskat, the Government of India considered that the important point was to get the Sultan to agree to prohibit the importation of arms and ammu nition. “ His consent can be procured when international agreement proposed “ is concluded, but abolition of traffic would involve heavy loss of income “ from customs duties, and, unless he were indemnified for this, he might “ be expected to obstruct passively measures for prevention of arms traffic. “ We would recommend that arrangements for compensation should be “ entrusted to us, as we and Turkey and Bersia are main, if not only, “ sufferers from Muskat trade. Payment of subsidy by Powers would be “ calamitous, and would inevitably lead to serious disturbance of status quo. “ Sultan might perhaps be induced to appoint British officer as superin- “ tendent of his customs, in order to ensure effective prohibition of “ import by thorough customs examination. We are ascertaining what “ sum would be a fair indemnity for Sultan’s loss of revenue. Political “ Agent, Muskat, estimates fair indemnity at 12,000k a year.* Political “ Resident in Persian Gulf thinks that it may be less.” In a further telegram, dated the 13th February 1908, the Government of India reported a recommendation by Major Cox that a suitable compensation to the Sultan for the loss of income entailed by the prohibition of the arms traffic would be to double the subsidy (5,760k per annum) he already received from Indian revenues,! and to raise it gradually, as might be necessary, to 15,000k per annum. 35. As a matter of fact no progress was made at Brussels with the ^ -y .. .. Muskat question. The Conference met Brussels Conference: Kegotrations 0R the ^ 8lh April 1908 0n tbe 2n d May 1908 the Italian delegate, Count Bonin, submitted a proposal on behalf of his Government to extend the * See paragraph 17 for a statement as to the value of the arms and ammunition imported into Muskat and of the Customs revenue from these imports. t The circumstance in which a subsidy of 5,7601. per annum was granted to the Sultan of Muskat were as follows:—On the death of Sultan Saiyid Said in 1856, a dispute arose between his two sons as to the possession of Muskat and Zanzibar, which had hitherto been united under the same ruler. The question was referred to the Viceroy of India, who decided that the two States should be separated and allotted each to one of the two brothers, but that Zanzibar, in virtue of its superior wealth, should pay Muskat a yearly subsidy of 40,000 crowns (5,760L). In 1873 the British Government, in return for agreements as to the suppression of the slave trade, which had been successfully concluded with Muskat and Zanzibar, undertook to relieve the latter of the payment of the subsidy, which has since been paid by the Government of India (with one brief intermission in 1888-90) to the reigning Sultan of Muskat. The Sultan was to receive this subsidy “ so long as he continued faithfully to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government.”provisions of the Brussels Act (including such new regulations as might he introduced as a result of the Conference then in session) so as to include the whole of Arabia and the opposite coast of the Persian Gulf, as well as the entire continent of Africa, within the zone of prohibition. The British delegates made a counter-proposal to restrict the zone in Arabia -to the Hadramaut and Red Sea coasts, and to exclude the whole of the Gulf littoral, both on the Persian and Arabian side. Sir A. Hardinge, in defending the British proposals (14th May 1908), pointed out that any extension to the Persian Gulf would be futile unless it embraced Muskat, and that the peculiar political and commercial conditions prevailing in the latter State rendered the application of the Brussels Act unsuitable, and made it “ easier to deal with the evil there by circuitous than by direct measures.” The British delegate therefore urged that, as regards Muskat, it would be wiser that the Treaty Powers, whose consent was necessary, should authorise the Sultan to “ take such measures as he deemed possible on his own initiative. On the 22nd May 1908 Count Bonin announced that the Italian Government, “ in a conciliatory spirit and in deference to the objections made by others,” withdrew its proposals to extend the zone of prohibition to the whole of Africa and Arabia, but that this concession, “ in so far as Oman and the Persian Gulf were concerned, was conditional upon the acceptance by the “ Conference of the British proposals respecting Muskat.” The British proposals were embodied in a draft article,'' which Sir A. Hardinge laid before the Conference on the 27th May 1908, providing that such of the signatory Powers as had commercial treaties with Oman should not, on the strength of any provisions contained in their treaties, offer opposition to such measures as the Sultan might be disposed to take, with a view to prohibiting the import of arms into, or their export from, his dominions. On the ord lime 1908 the Dutch delegate stated that his Government was prepared to grant the Sultan of Muskat full liberty to deal with the arms traffic m Oman, provided that other Powers having treaty.rights with His Highness concurred. The United States delegate made a declaration to the same effect. On tlie following day, however, (4th June 1908), the French Delegates announced to the Conference that they could not consent to discuss the Muskat question in Conference, but they intimated confidentially to Sir A Hardinge tint their Government might be willing to negotiate privately withll.s J a e y s Government on the subject. On the 11th June 190b ims Maje } Ambassador at Paris was instructed to approach the French Govermnen in the matter. It is not proposed to deal m detail with the negotiations n followed.

On approaching the shore two days later one of the “ Proserpine’s ” boats was fired at, one bluejacket being killed and another wounded. 200 men were subsequently landed from the “ Proserpine ” to protect the Jask station.- On the 7th May 1908 the Government of India telegraphed that large quantities of arms and ammu nition (amounting, according to their latest information, to about 12,500 rifles with probably 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition) had already been landed on the Persian coast, and that no adequate arrangements had been made by the Persian Government for intercepting caravans. On the 22nd May 1908 Mr. Marling, the British Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, reported that he had been “ constantly urging ” the Persian Government “ to take measures “to force the caravans to take the route through British Baluchistan, “ where the British Government has a small force in readiness to intercept “ them.” Mr. Marling stated that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of the Interior had both promised to do all they could, but that he feared it was- hopeless to expect any effective action, as the local authorities were without the funds requisite to raise and pay men for the purpose, and the Central Government was quite unable to furnish them with money. On the 30th June 1908 the Government of India telegraphed a summary of the traffic between the Gulf and Afghanistan during the gun-running season that had just come to an end. The main caravan (with some 1,000 ment and 900 camels) which reached Afghanistan ma Began and Nasratabad Ispe on the 8th June 1908 was believed to have canied 12,500 lilies with about 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition, all of which came from Muskat and were landed in small boats at various points on the Jlekran coast. In addition to this, information had been received of three other small caravans, two of which passed into Afghanistan through Persian teiutopy, vvhile the third crossed a corner of Baluchistan. Another party of ahout JJO Afghans had passed near Gurg on the 15th June 1908 on its way to the Afghan frontier. On the 19th September 1908 the Government of India n that ac ) !0rd | n f \° n tlieir information, at least 30,000 rifles and 3,000,000 cartndgesj had been imported into Afghanistan and tribal territory during the past 18 months, and that there had been a heavy fall m the prices of rifles and ammunition. No real attempt was made by t le I ersian authorities to stop the passage of the caravans through their territory Ihe Governor of Kain did indeed send some troops to intercept the mam caravan, but all that they did was to cut off two Afghan stragglers (whom they captured while asleep) and kill them in cold Viceroy’s telegram of 30th June 1908. 1290/08. 7th March° 1909 H P MS in tl ? e ear h P art of 1909 - °“ the ah .Uaich 1J09 H.M.S.

A new and unpleasant feature of the season of 1908 was the threatened attack made by a party of Afghans belonging to the main caravan upon the Indo-European Department’s Telegraph station at Dehaneh,' ::: ‘ their avowed object being to kill an Englishman in revenge for having had six men killed on the coast while engaged in the arms traffic. As it happened there was no European official at Dehaneh, and the Afghans, having ascertained this, did not proceed to the telegraph station, but contented themselves with carrying off a native lineman in the employ ment of the Department. The latter was at first reported to have been put to death, but he subsequently escaped from his captors and made his way to Koh-i-Malik Siah. After the caravan had reached Afghanistan in safety, 20 Afghans turned back to take vengeance for the death of their two comrades who had been killed by the Persian troops. (See paragraph 36.) Proposal for Military Cordon on Persian Coast. Sir A. McMalion, to Government of India, 24th October 1908. 2078/08. 38. The whole situation was reviewed by Sir A. H. McMahon, Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, in a report to the Government of India, dated the 24th October 1908. He pointed out that the preventive measures taken during the past year had been practically ineffectual in checking the smuggling of arms, while they had exasperated the Afghan gun-runners and made it probable that they would retaliate upon outlying stations of the Indo-European Telegraph Department during the coming season. He considered that only two courses were open to us for the coming- season, viz., either— (1.) To abandon all serious attempts at prevention and confine ourselves merely to defensive measures for the protection of telegraph stations, &amp;c. We should thus, he observed, “ be saved great expense, trouble, and risk, and the quantity of arms and ammu nition that will reach Afghanistan will be in no way affected (2.) To adopt preventive measures on a really large scale, both by land and sea, including the establishment of a strong military cordon in Persian territory, either inland through Pobat and Bam (in prolongation of the line held during the previous season on the British side of the frontier, see paragraph 22) or, preferably, along the coast line from Bunder Abbas to Gwettur (over 400 miles). In view of “ the serious danger that threateus the peace of our Indian “ frontier from the wholesale armament of our frontier tribes, and the “ trouble which threatens in the future from huge accumulations of “ arms and ammunition in Persian Baluchistan,” Sir A. McMahon felt “ reluctantly compelled ” to recommend the adoption of alternative No. (2), rather than incur the evil effect of even one more arms traffic season. He considered that two regiments of infantry would suffice for the proposed cordon. 39 . It was considered, however, that political and financial considerations _ , r i aaa precluded for the present the employ- Viceroy s te egram, ^ anuai} . men t of troops in Persian territory or any considerable increase of naval the Gulf. The Government of India recommended that naval activity should be continued with the 1909 . force available, but no other special 2850a/09. action taken during the coming season. This course was approved by His Majesty’s Government on the 15th January 154/09. activity in Lord Morley’s telegram, 15th January 1909. . , Arrangements were made at the same time for the temporary withdrawal of the Dehaneh telegraph staff to Koh-i-Malik Siah. * Dehaneh lies some 12 miles to the west of Gerageh, a regular halting-place cn the caravan road between Regan and Seistan. The Afghans wrecked the telegraph line at Gerageh immediately on arriving there.24 IV. Events subsequent to Brussels Conference : Naval Blockade Operations. Situation in 1909. Government of India’s letter, 2nd Sep tember 1909. 1332/09. 40. On the 2nd September 1909 the Government of India again addressed the Secretary of State on the subject. After referring to their previous des patch of the 21st February 1907 (see paragraphs 31-32), they remarked that the suspension of the negotiations with France had rendered it “ necessary to review the situation and to examine once more the practicability of measures for the suppression of the traffic.” The evil effects of the trade had been in no degree mitigated. “ The “ evidence which we have been able to collect as to the course of the trade ‘ during the past two years proves that the apprehensions which we then “ expressed were in no way exaggerated. Not only has the traffic in modern “ arms and ammunition with Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier “ continued to flourish, but there has been a steady increase in the proportion “ of magazine rifles imported, and we have received information that recent “ consignments included parts of a machine gun.” They pointed out the results of the continued importation had been to reduce the price of rifles on the North-West Frontier by about 50 per cent., and that the fall in price had been so steady that “ local factories in inde- “ pendent territory no longer find it profitable to manufacture rifles and are “ closing their business.” 41. The result was, in the Government of India’s opinion, to produce a situation of considerable danger (1) in Afghanistan ; (2) in tribal territory on the North-West Frontier ; and (3) in India itself. (1.) In Afghanistan the Amir, it was pointed out, had, for whatever reason,reversed the policy of his predecessor, and given every encouragement to the import of modern rifles and ammunition into his kingdom. The wholesale arming of the Afghans which had ensued would, the Government of India considered, “ materially increase our difficulties in the event of armed “ intervention whether that be brought about by the hostility of “ the Amir or by anarchy arising from internal rebellion.” It may be worth mentioning in this place that early in November 1909 a report was received from Herat to the effect that 70 Afridis had arrived from the Indian frontier and were going to the Persian Gulf as guards for Afghan arms traders. The Afridis left Herat for the Gulf on the 1st November 1909 ; they were provided with passports at Kabul, and were assisted by the Governor of Herat. A second contingent of 30, for whom the Herat Commander-in-Chief stood surety, arrived at Herat on the 3rd November 1909 and left two days later with an Afghan caravan of 40 camels bound for Bunder Abbas. The Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan con sidered that the fact of the contingents going so far out of the direct route to the Gulf as Herat, showed that they had been sent to escort a consignment of arms in which the Afghan Government had a personal interest. (2.) In tribal territory the arming of the tribesmen had been proceeding rapidly (see paragraph 25). The armament return of the frontier tribes showed an increase of 26,000 rifles during the past year, * The Government of India suggested that the Amir’s change of policy might be due to the “ distrust and suspicion ” engendered by the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 31st August 1907 having induced him “ to prepare for a struggle which he regards as inevitable.” But it is worth noting that this reversal by the Amir of his father’s policy in regard to the importation of arms had already been reported by the Government of India in their despatch dated 21st February 1907, six months before the Anglo-Russian Agreement was signed. (See paragraph 26.) A25 'essed ♦ bject. des- (*ee f tbat with The wde then dern k itier lion cent i to ;nt, ide- are ea rer ?1 T m ch i ed of a in ,n ;r y it r r y. K exclusive of Dir, Swat, and Bajaur, where, it was estimated, the stock of rifles had been increased by 33,500. Consciousness of increased strength might, it was feared, lead to concerted action by the tribes on a scale hitherto unknown ; and, considering the diffi culties experienced in the past in dealing with tribal risings when the tribesmen were comparatively ill-armed and possessed no great quantity of ammunition, the Government of India could not but “ regard with apprehension the scale on which future expeditions “ will have to be conducted, and the expenditure which wall be “ involved when the tribesmen are armed with magazine rifles “ and have an abundant supply of ammunition. Already, it may “ be noted, the militia corps have lost much of the superiority “ which better arms and more abundant ammunition gave them in “ the past, and which enabled them to cope successfully with “ raiding bands ot greater numerical strength ; and raiders have “ shown a tendency to conduct their operations with increasing “ boldness and in organised gangs of greater strength than “ hitherto. To deal with these gangs parties of fifty or sixty men “ have now to be sent out where twelve or fourteen were formerly “ sufficient.” (3.) In India itself there was a danger that the North-West frontier might become “ a possible source from which the forces of sedition in internal India will obtain supplies of arms and ammunition.” To sum up, the Government of India considered that a political and military situation had arisen in Afghanistan and on the NorthAYest frontier “ which has upset the balance of power, and constitutes a serious “ menace to the maintenance of peace. The gravity of the position is such “ as, in our judgment, to call for immediate and effective action,, and “ we can no longer safely afford to await the uncertain issues of diplomacy. “ We are strongly of opinion that any reasonable means and expenditure “ having for their aim the suppression of this traffic will not only prove “ economical in the end, but are imperatively demanded to avert a danger wffiich, if permitted to increase, may seriously embarrass our position in “ India.” 42. The Government of India then proceeded to discuss the question of remedial measures, and to consider the practicability of action (1) in Afghanistan, (2) at Muskat, (3) in Persia and on the Mekran coast, and (4) in the Persian Gulf. Of these alternative courses they rejected all but the last. (1.) As regards Afghanistan, the Amir’s attitude was considered to be such as to preclude all hope that he would consent to give us control of the supply of arms to Afghanistan. (2 ) As regards Muskat, the Political Agent (Mr. Holland) had suggested, in a letter dated the 4th April 1909,f that some effort should be made to secure the Sultan’s co-operation in suppressing the tiaffic. Mr. Holland recognised that the time was not yet ripe for considering the larger question of a permanent increase of the Sultan’s subsidy as compensation lor the loss of customs revenue, in the event of the Brussels Conference (then in session) resulting- in the prohibition of the import of arms into Muskat. But he suo-gested that it might be worth while “ to negotiate on similar “ fines with his Highness in order to secure his co-operation solely “ jn connection with the prevention of export to the Mekran coast. “If so while the strength of our own position with reference to “ the Sultan’s failure to fulfil his obligations should not be “ forgotten, and should even be revealed to his Highness at the “ diplomatic moment, we might perhaps be prepared to purchase “ his assistance in stopping the export by a payment of, say, “ 5,000 rupees a month (4,000L a year). In return for this the “ Sultan should be required to take measures to prevent, from June * Enclosure No. 1 in Government of India’s letter of 2nd September 1909“ the end of this arms season, onwards, all exports from Oman “ ports to the Mekran coast. “ It would have to be clearly understood that the arrangement “ was purely temporary, and that it would be abrogated by a “ wider and entirely independent agreement to be concluded later, if possible, for the abolition of import.” Neither the Resident in the Persian Gulf nor the Government of India considered Mr. Holland’s suggestion practicable. Major Cox pointed out that the Sultan had “ absolutely no machinery” for effectively preventing exports from Oman to Mekran, and that it was never supposed that he could “ seal his own long line of coast” against the export of arms. Major Cox added that “as “ long as the import remains legitimate there would be nothing to prevent a foreign merchant like Goguyer from receiving his “ consignments from the steamer into dhows in the harbour and “ sending the latter off to some other port in Oman which he could “ make his headquarters.” Mr. Holland, it should be added, afterwards explained (6th July 1909) that what he contemplated was, “ not that His Highness “ should take active steps to blockade his own line of coast, which “ would be beyond the bounds of possibility, but that he should render us assistance, which would be well within his power, in “ enforcing the blockade of the Mekran coast.” He had never contemplated that the Sultan’s co-operation would do away with the necessity for action on our part on the Mekran coast, so long as the importation of arms into Muskat continued. But he believed that the Sultan, if it was made worth his while, could assist our blockade very material^ by letting it be known locally that he was opposed to the traffic to Mekran, by employing his numerous spies to inform against his subjects engaged in the trade, by punishing the crews ol dhows seized by British ships, and by generally signifying his displeasure with the gun-runners. Major Cox, ^ however, still found himself unable to support Mr. Holland s recommendations, and remarked that his own inclination was in favour of “ first showing the Sultan that we can ^ and will make the blockade effectual, and then of paying him whateyei seems fair for the loss of revenue which we see “ resulting to him.” I he Government of India concurred with Major Cox, and thought that an arrangement such as that proposed by Mr. Holland would “ raise more difficulties than it would settle, and would not improbably be ineffectual.” (o.) As legards the third alternative mentioned above, viz., that of measures on the Coast of Persia, the Government of India were doubtful whether “ military action along the Persian littoral would yield results commensurate with the expenditure involved.” They recognised, moreover, that such action “ would appear to be u P rec f u ded by the conditions of the present political situation in lersia, and our treaty obligations.”^ 43. There remained the last of the four alternatives referred to in the Proposals for a Naval Blockaded preceding paragraph, that of naval ^ * actwn in the Persian Gulf. Among the enclosures^ m the Government of India’s letter, was a despatch dated 1 1 QOQ r M ga f? 1 * * * S p Pr p VeiltlVe m p ei h sm T? in f n ff a it may be mentioned that on the 9th Novem ber 1909, Mr. L. G. Gregson, of the North-West Frontier Province Police, was placed on special deputation to Karachi with a view to the arrest, if possible, of a number of Afridis and other tribesmen who were knowm to be proceeding via Karachi to Muskat in connection with the arms tiamc. Mr. Gregson succeeded in effecting a large number of arrests , t It has been pointed out by the Foreign Office that the use of the word blockade in connection with the naval operations undertaken in the Persian Gulf in January 1910 is not strictly correct The measures adopted did not constitute a blockade in the technical sense in which the word is ordinarily understood, but merely a patrol of the coast for the purpose of checking the illegal traffic. 1 1 + Enclosure No. 3.7th May 1909, from Admiral Slade, Commander-in-Chief, East Indies fetation, in which he submitted proposals for blockading the Mekran coast from the sea. Admiral Slade estimated that four second or third class cruisers would be required for this service, so that one vessel might always be away coaling _ and resting, while the other three were actively employed in blockading the coast. I wo out of the four vessels could be supplied from the East Indies Station, but the two others must be specially detailed for the work. Admiral Slade added that it would be necessary for all four ships to be fitted with wireless telegraphy, and that “ it would add greatly to the efficiency of the blockade if the Government of India would sanction and erect the proposed wireless station at Jask.” The Admiral also recom mended the reinforcement of the Jask guard,* to protect the station from possible reprisals by land, and the posting at the same place of a trained Intelligence officer. Admiral Slade felt confident that, if the measures proposed by him were adopted, it ought to be possible to stop a large proportion of arms going through. Every dhow approaching the coast would be searched night and day, and, with a capable officer in charge of the blockade, “ the price of arms on the Afghan frontier ought to rise two or three hundred per cent.” The blockade should, in the Admiral’s opinion, last from the 1st January to the end of April. 44. The Government of India expressed their full concurrence in Admiral Slade’s proposals, but considered that, to be effective, the blockade should be maintained for a full year and should be started with the least possible delay. They also referred to the question of cost, and expressed the view that, under the terms of the Welby Commission’s Report, “ the cost of any “ naval measures outside the fixed contribution which India now pays should “ fall on the Imperial Government.” In conclusion they reaffirmed their opinion as to the necessity of coming to some arrangement with France, by which His Majesty’s Government would secure a free hand to take action at Muskat. 45. A subsequent report from Mr. Holland, dated the 13th September 1909, showed that the import of arms Arms Depots on Mekran Coast. an q ammunition into Mekran was pro- 1531/09. ceeding with great rapidity,! and that arms depots v r ere apparently being formed along the coast, which, if the smuggling continued unchecked, would, in a few weeks contain sufficient arms to satisfy Afghan caravans for the whole of the cold weathei. As regards these depots, Admiral Slade stated, m a lettei to the Government of India, dated 19th November 1909, that “it appears that the arms “ which are landed on the Persian coast are never taken far inland at “ once, but are stored in the villages 4350/09. “ within a few miles of the places at “which they are disembarked.” The Admiral added that he had, at the moment of writing, information as to the whereabouts of some 0,000 rifles and corresponding ammunition. 46. The Government of India s proposals were communicated to the i Foreign Office in Sir R. Ritchie’s letter n Ybqnq 06 to gI1 ’ of tlle 15th October 1909, with the C ^° C1 1332/09. recommendation that “ an effective naval blockade should be undertaken at once ” ; it was also suggested that “ a series of short raids by boats’ crews upon the Mekran depots described by Mr. Holland ” might be a feature of the operations. t Mr HoHaiu^Reported that 3,000 rifles and 212,000 rounds of ammunition had been imported Ling the past month, as compared with 645 rifles and 69,000 rounds of ammunition during the corresponding period of 1908.28 47. Both, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty agreed to the proposed Blockade: Amended Proposals. blockade. The Admiralty in a letter Admiralty to India Office, 2nd December ^ated the 2nd December 1909, m agree- 1909. ing to provide the additional ships''' 4286/09. required, recommended— (1.) That eight steam launches or small steamers should be hired at Indian ports and attached to the blockading cruisers, since ships’ boats could not catch dhows in a fair wind. (2.) That one Royal Indian Marine vessel should be employed to act as depot ship. (3.) That three Bombay torpedo boats, if in seaworthy condition, should be utilised. This suggestion ivas dropped, as it was ascertained that the torpedo boats had been sold by the Government of India; (4.) That, concurrently with the naval blockade, a military coast patrol should be established from the Persian frontier as far eastward as might be necessary. It was estimated that the extra cost of a year’s blockade would amount to 84,000Z.t The Admiralty regarded the matter as one “very largely, if “ not entirely . . . concerning the administration of the Government of “ India,” and, therefore, proposed to claim repayment of the expenditure involved from Indian revenues. Employment of military force. Admiral Slade to Government of India, 19tli November 1909. 4350/09. “ shore, so as to ensure that any 48. The naval proposals were further supplemented by Admiral Slade in a letter to the Government of India, dated 19th November 1909. He con sidered that “ to make the utmost use “ of our sea power we ought to follow “ up the operations afloat by action on cargoes which escape our boats shall eventually fall into our hands.” The force required for this purpose would not be large, but some reinforcement of the ships’ crews would be desirable in view of the severe work entailed. He therefore recommended that the marines should be reinforced by troops embarked for the purpose, and conveyed in a separate ship fitted up as a transport. In order to preserve to the contingent “ its character of being a naval force,” it would be under the direct command and authority of the senior naval officer on the spot, and would always comprise a certain number of sailors. As regards the nature of the action contemplated, Admiral Slade explained that “ no occupation “ of Persian territory would be involved, for I do not propose to do more than “ raid any village in which arms are stored, or follow up any cargo which has been landed so as to seize the arms and ammunition, and then to “ re-embark the men at once. The utmost time that they would be on shore “ would probably not exceed two or three days.” 49. In a telegram dated the 19th November 1909 the Viceroy informed Viceroy’s telegram of 19th November Secretary of State that he had 1909. ^ personally discussed the situation with 1627/09. tfm Naval Commander-in-Chief, and that they both agreed that it was “important to land parties to make good * The proposal was that four ships should be engaged on the blockade, viz.:—The three subsidised ships (“Fox,” “Perseus,” and “Proserpine”), and one additional vessel (“ Philomel ”). In addition, two other vessels (“ Odin ” and “ Alert ”) would be detailed and ready before the end of the financial year, which would enable a continuous blockade to be kept up from the Biyaban coast to Gwettur with four ships. It was stated that four of these six ships were fitted with wireless telegraphy, and that orders had been given for fitting the other two. The “ Perseus ” and the “ Alert ” were subsequently diverted from the blockade in the Persian Gulf for service urgently required in connection with affairs in Somaliland. t This sum was calculated “ on the basis of the subsidised ships,” in respect of the three additional ships, “ Philomel,” “ Odin,” and “ Alert ” to be detailed for the blockade. See paragraph 54 (note).captures of arms or raid depots as far as action from ships will permit.” It will be remembered that the proposal to raid the depots was made in the India Office letter to the Foreign Office dated the 15th October 1909. (See paragraph 46.) As regards the diplomatic aspect of this proposal, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, after discussing the question with Major Cox, reported on the 9th November 1909 that he did not think a land cordon of troops desirable, as it would delay the withdrawal of Russian troops in the north, but he saw no objection to the temporary landing of bluejackets. In the event of complaints from the Persian Government, he thought His Majesty’s Govern ment would have a strong case. He thought it would be useless to try to obtain effective co-operation from Persia. 50. On the 4th December 1909 the Government of India reported that wireless apparatus was being temporarily erected at Jask, and that Major H. H. Austin, C.M.G., was being sent to that port as Intelligence Officer. Wireless communication between Jask and the ships in the Gulf was opened on the 24th December 1909. The question of the arrangements for a permanent wireless station at Jask is under consideration. 51. It will be convenient in Captures of Arms, November cember 1909. this place of captures -De- to give some account of arms effected in November and December 1909 before the commencement of the blockade proper. On the 5th November 1909, H.M.S. “ Fox ” captured a Persian dhow named “ Badil ” in Lima Bay, on the Oman coast, with about 1,300 rifles and 119,000 rounds of ammunition on board. The dhow hew no hag, and no papers were found on board. On the 3rd December 1909 the Naval Commander-in-Chief reported the capture by H.M.S. “ Fox,” on the high seas, of a Persian dhow, the “ Khairi,” manned by Persians, and carrying 419 rihes, 84 pistols, and 220,000 ^ rounds _ of ammunition. The “ Khairi carried Mr. Holland to Government of India, n0 fl a g or papers, but had a pass from 16th January 1910. tlie saltan of Muskat holding good for territorial waters only. Part of the cargo was consigned to merchants in Persia and part to El Ivatr. Two further seizures, both on the high seas were reported by Admiral Slade early in December 1909 :—(1) On the 4th December 1909, . ■&gt; • a P' vl '8 captured a dhow flying no colours, but having 1,708 rifles and -11,000 rounds of ammunition on board.

'(PP- 86-57) for table giving particulars as to all seizures between Xovef W9 P 09 and April 19W, and as to disposal of captured arms.30 The Government of India were informed of the issue of these instructions in Lord Morn’s telegram of the 16th December 1909. 52. Apart from the question of the incidence of the cost of the blockade, , „ ^ . . as to which there was a sharp division Disposal of Captured Arms. 0 £ 0 pi n i 0 n between the Admiralty and the Government of India, the principal difficulty lay in the question of the disposal of captured arms and ammunition. The orders issued by His Majesty’s Government in 1900, and repeated in 1902, have already been quoted in this Memorandum [see paragraph 29). Briefly stated, they required all seizures made in territorial waters to be handed over to the government in whose territorial waters the dhow was captured, and all seizures made on the high seas to be handed over to the government of the country to whom the captured dhow belonged. In a telegram dated Viceroy’s telegram of 27th December the 2 / th December 1909 the Govern- 1909. “ ment of India stated that, after 1731/09. considering the whole question in Council, they held that “ it would be useless to undertake a costly blockade “ scheme as long as the present arrangements with Persia and Muskat “as t3 disposal of captures continue.” They cited the case of the dhow “ Badil,” captured off the Oman coast on the 5th November 1909 (see paragraph 51), and reported that the Sultan claimed the return of the arms taken on board the dhow, on the ground that seizure within Muskat limits was improper, as the “Badil” had a pass on board which, if found, would prove that the arms were not intended for export to Persia. The Government of India added that, according to a later report from the Political Agent at Muskat, the Sultan was pressing for a reply and was exasperated at the delay in returning the arms, regarding their detention as an “ insult to his authority as a ruler.” The Government of India also referred to the case of the “ Khairi ” (see paragraph 51) as another instance in which the Sultan had raised an objection, claiming the portion of the cargo consigned to El Katr, although the dhow was not a Muskat boat, and was not captured in Muskat waters. The Sultan’s attitude in regard to these incidents showed, in the Government of India’s opinion, that, despite his proclamation of 1898, he “ is evidently an active accomplice of arms traders ”; and they added that there was a “consensus “ of opinion that any arms restored by us to Sultan would find their way “ back to the owner.” As regards Persia, the Government of India presumed that, “ in the present disordered state ” of the country, the Persian Govern ment was interested in checking the illegal importation of arms. They therefore urged that the Persian Government should be pressed “ to give us the right to destroy such captured arms and ammunition as under existing conditions are made over to them,” and that if Persia’s agreement could be obtained to this proposal, “strong pressure might then be brought to bear upon the Sultan of Muskat, and we might insist on his granting us “ the right to destroy amis and ammunition consigned to Persia or India.” Subject to arrangements being made on the lines indicated, the Government of India were in favour of the Admiralty scheme ” {see paragraph 47) supplemented by Laval Commander-in-Chief s proposal to employ troops to strengthen landing parties for seizure of arms stored in villages ” {see paragraph 48). The strength of the force to be employed for'this lattei purpose would be 12 British officers, 600 Indian rank and file, with 141 mules. Ihe tioops would be sent to the Gulf on board a transport, for which, as w ell as lor the proposed depot ship, a Royal Indian Marine vessel would be^ utilised. Any Afghans captured would be sent via Karachi to the (N oith-West Frontier Province, where, as at present, they could be dealt with under the orders of the Chief Commissioner. - the actual troops employed were one section 31st Mountain Battery, one section No. 18 Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners, headquarters, and four companies 123rd Outram’s Rifles with two maxims and one section No. 151 Indian Field Hospital. The troops embarked for the Gnlf on R I.M.S. Hardmge on 21st January 1910. The “ Hardinge ” left the Gulf on her return to India on the 1st April 1910.Do. Ill iepl&gt; to the telegram of the 27th December 1909, the Government- t9io° rd Moi ' ley s tele 8' rani of 1st January of India were instructed as follows on 4360/09 t ^ ie Januar y 1910 :— “It is very undesirable to raise large general question, either with Persian Government who have so far made no claim under agreement to confiscated cargoes, or with Sultan of Muskat whose attitude is likely to be difficult. It seems better to deal with each case on its merits as it arises. In case of “ Badil ” and similar cases, Sultan should be informed that we are prepared to give arms to him eventually, but in meantime will keep them for him until we are satisfied that there is no chance of their returning to dealers. In case of “ Khairi and similar cases, he should be informed that his claim is untenable and cargo should be destroyed. When a dhow is captured in Muskat waters and her papers are in order, but there are good 'prima facie grounds for believing that she is engaged in illegitimate traffic, she may be detained pending further enquiry, Sultan being at once informed ; if result of enquiry satisfactory she must be released, if not cargo may be retained for eventual restoration to Saltan. Similar procedure should be followed with Muskat dhows captured outside Muskat waters if circumstances make destruction unadvisable. In dealing with Sultan it should be explained to him that our intention is not to make him suffer pecuniarily.” The Government of India rather demurred to the last proposal (viz., assurance that the Sultan should not suffer pecuniarily), and expressed the hope (in their telegram of 12th January 1910) that this question might lie over. Meanwhile, the Political Agent at Muskat was instructed that if the Sultan himself referred to the subject, “he should be told that the question of pecuniary loss will be referred to Government of India.” These instruc tions were approved by the Secretary of State on the 4th February 1910, subject to a warning as to the importance of not throwing the Sultan into the arms of the French, or “ exasperating him to point of withdrawing authority he has given us to search dhows.” In the same telegram (1st January 1910) the Secretary of State suggested that, in order to “ close whole coast of Gulf outside Oman,” it might be possible to persuade the Chief of Nejd to prohibit the import of arms. The Government of India considered, however, that no useful purpose would be served by approaching the Nejd Chief, who appeared to have no effective jurisdiction on the coast.” 54 On the 6th January 1910 the Government of India were further instructed that the blockade, if still Commencsinent of Blockade : Ins true- considered essential, should begin at tions to Admiral. once&gt; the question of the incidence of Viceroy’s telegram of 12th January its cost'” being left for future settlement. 1910 - Accordingly on the 11th January 1910, the following instructions were issued to the Naval Commander-in-Chief “ Government of India sanction blockade on lines originally proposed by you, including use of eight launches, but in view of senous financial position here desire to know whether you could not carry out operations * The cost of the Blockade was estimated as follows in the Viceroy s telegram of 17th January 1910:— For 4 months :— Home Indian Army Marine £ 57,260 13,273 21,613 Total - - - 92,146 For 12 months :— Home Indian Army Marine - 166,574 25,300 58,106 249,980 Totaleffectively without reducing troops but without employing transport ship which is very costly. As regards disposal of arms, please see telegram from Secretary of State of 1st January (paragraph Oo). I lease arrange to destroy arms and ammunition captured on ‘ Khairi.’ McMahon has ordered Mekran levies to co-operate with navy, and warned tribes on British Baluchistan coast. As regards rumour of reported impending attacks on Chahbar, Government of India must leave it to local naval authorities in communication with officer commanding troops on the spot to take necessary action, but raids inland should be limited to purpose of seizing arms stored in villages. Afghans should not be attacked unless they are engaged in removing arms or actually threatening Jask or Chahbar. The whole position must be reviewed in April owing to pressure of financial situation, and Government of India are confident that Your Excellency will exercise every economy compatible with efficiency.” The employment of a transport was subsequently sanctioned, R.I.M. “ Hardinge ” being used for the purpose. R.I.M. “Minto” was detailed for service as Depot ship. Attitude of Persian Government. Sir G. Barclay to Sir E. Grey, 29th January 1910. 2914/10. 55. As regards Persia, Sir G. Barclay, the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed on the 29th January 1910, with reference to a successful raid on an arms depot in the Jask hinterland (see paragranh 57), which had just been reported by the naval authorities, that he presumed that the treatment prescribed in the Agreement of 1897 (see para graph 7 and Appendix V.) in respect of arms seized in Persian waters “ should apply a fortiori to arms seized on Persian soil.” He pointed out that the Persian Government would doubtless lose no time in presenting a claim for compensation in respect of the recent captures, and submitted that if the Government of India were not prepared to pay, in future cases orders Tr . , . , 1T , . ,„ should be given that “arms captured Viceroys telegram 1st February 1910. T -, . ° n -i -i n -i i i , on Persian soil should be held at the disposal of the Persian Government.” The Government of India demurred altogether to Sir G. Barclay’s proposal^ pointing out that— “It is owing to impotence of Persian Government that Afghan gun runners have threatened our telegraph stations and fired on our boats, and that we have been forced to undertake very expensive measures. Persian Government have no officer on Mekran coast to whom arms could be safely entrusted, and could not reasonably expect us to transport the contraband to Bunder Abbas or Bushire. ' It seems to us that there is a very strong case against compensation, and we could put in many counter claims.” 56. The Viceroy was informed on the 8th February that instructions had T , cut t been sent to Sir G. Barclay to replv in 1910 j o &gt; ^ ti ie sense tPe above remarks, if the 2938/10. Persian Government raised the question. “ Meanwhile, except where clearly ^ necessary for sake of public example, arms captured on high seas should not be destioyed but kept m order that there may be a stock from which I ersiaii Government can be compensated if they press claim difficult to i esist. Such arms, it was added, would be useful to the Persian Govern ment, if effect were given to the scheme for organising road guards in Southern Persia. o i . I he na\ al authorities lost no time in giving effect to the Government of India’s orders of the 11th January 1910 (see paragraph 54), and the blockade was put into operation without deiay. Captures of Arms, January—May 1910 .H.M.S. “Perseus ” had already (on the 1st January 1910) landed a party at Pishkan, the westernmost point of the Gwadur enclave on the Mekran coast (belonging to Muskat), and effected a capture of 850 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. The arms, &amp;c., were destroyed. On the 16th January a raid was made by a force consisting of 95 men from H.M.S. “ Fox,” and some 50 sepoys upon a depot at Geigan in the neighbourhood of Jask. 1,350 rifles and 160,000 rounds of ammunition were destroyed. No Afghans were encountered. On the 23rd January a party from the “ Philomel ” captured 20,000 rounds of ammunition in a disused fortress near Bunji, a few miles to the west of Jask. On the night of the 26th January a force was landed from the “Hardinge” (which had arrived at Jask that day) and the “ Hyacinth ” to find and destroy an arms depot believed to be established on the Jagin river in Mekran. After a march of 7-|- hours the depot was found guarded by a party of Afghans. The latter were driven out of a sangar in a strong position, and 750 rifles and carbines, together with some 50,000 rounds of ammunition, were destroyed. Three Afghans were killed; there were no British casualties. On the 24th April 1910, H.M.S. “ Philomel ” captured at sea two dhows bound for Bunji with a cargo of 1,998 rifles, 158 pistols, and 907,000 rounds of ammunition. These arms, &amp;c., were destroyed “as a public example, in consequence of the recrudescence of the traffic in arms” (see paragraph 75). On the 6th May 1910 the Sheikh of Koweit handed over to the Political Agent a consignment of 301 rifles and 30.100 yomuls of ammunition, which had been landed at Koweit by a dhow (the “ Fateh-el-Khair ”) flying the French flag. Finally, on the 25th May 1910, H.M.S. “Perseus” captured a dhow, 13 miles from Maidani, carrying 2,260 rifles, 50 pistols and 270,000 rounds of ammunition. Jotal captures between 1st January and 31st May 1910 7,519 rifles, 208 pistols, and 1.537.100 rounds of ammunition. To this list may be added the case of the “ Muzaffa, a Koweit dhow which was boarded by H.M.S. “Hyacinth” in Muskat waters on the 27th Januarv 1910. This dhow, which had a cargo of arms and ammunition consigned for Koweit, was eventually allowed to continue hei voyage, as there were no grounds for supposing her cargo to be intended foi Peisian territory (see paragraph 63). A table giving particulars as to all seizures effected in the Persian Gulf from November 1909 to May 1910, and as to the disposal of the captured arms and ammunition, is printed as Appendix XI\ . (pp. 56-57). 58 A few words may be said as to the measures taken to piovide against reprisals by Afghan gun-runners on the Precautions against reprisals by stations of the Indo-European Telegraph (jun-runnei s. Department m Southern Persia. Prior to Jask and Chahbar guards. 1908 the telegraph stations at Jask and Chahbar had a normal guard of 52 men each. In April 1908, o\ving to the threatening attitude of the Afghans^engaged in the arms traffic, the Jask guard was temporarily reinforced by 50 men under a British officer. ■■ A similar temporary reinforcement was authorised in November 1908,7 and again in November 1909. In December 1909 it was decided to reinforce the Chahbar guard by 100 men under a British officer. In the same month the Government of India proposed to send a further detachment ol 100 men to Jask, thus bringing up the strength of the guard at that place to about 200 men. This increase, in view of reports of Afghan activity received iiom the Intelligence Officer, Jask, was approved by His Majesty’s Government on the 20th December 1909, but, under subsequent orders, the despatch ol the men was held in abeyance pending further developments On the 18th January 1910 the Government of India were authorised to despatch the additional 100 men “ if and when you think necessary.” On the 1/th February 1910 owing to the truculent behaviour of the Afghans m the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbas, His Majesty’s Government sanctioned the reinforcement ol * Reinforcement withdrawn in June 190b. t Reinforcement withdrawn in June 1909.A 34 the Consular guard 0 at that place by 50 men under a British officer. On the 27th February 1010 the Government of India telegraphed :—Admiral “ reports no immediate danger now of reprisals on part of Afghans since “ majority have left the coast. Arms which have been landed have been “ removed inland out of reach.” It was accordingly proposed that the “ Hardinge ” should return to India with the troops on the 7th March. Owing, however, to fresh arrivals of Afghans in the Biyaban districts the “ Hardinge’s ” return was subsequently deferred. It was decided to maintain the Jaskand Chahbar garrisons, for the time being, at their existing strengths. The “Hardinge ” was eventually authorised to return to Bombay on the 1st April 1910. As regards the protection of telegraph stations in the interior, the special Robat garrison. reinforcement of 500 men sent to Robat in April 1908 (see paragraph 22) was withdrawn in the following autumn. But the double company of Native Infantry (about 200 men) which had been posted to Robat in 1900 (see para graph 22, footnote) was still retained. In January 1909 the further temporary retention of this force was sanctioned by His Majesty’s Government with a view to the protection of the telegraph staff between Bam and Robat against j^/nQ attacks by Afghan gun-runners. On the 30th March 1909 the Government of India were authorised to withdraw the detachment at the close of the gun- 3340/09 running season. On the 29th April 1909 the British Minister at Tehran telegraphed that he presumed the removal of the troops from Robat was only until the beginning of the next season. Otherwise, Sir G. Baiclay considered that the position of the Indo-European Telegraph Department would be very difficult, as, without troops at Robat, the telegraph staff at Dehaneh would “have nothing nearer to fall back on in case of 683/09. necessity ” than Kerman. Sir G. n , , T ' t \ , Barclay was informed in reply by the Government of India that the “possibility of having to send troops period- u icall y to Robat had been foreseen, and question would be considered before commencement of next arms traffic season.” On the 10th December 1909 1683/09.

As regards the local Persian Sirdars in the coast districts, whose Attitude of Chiefs of Persian Balu- a 1 t ^ tu / e towards the arms traffic has chistan. already been referred to (see para- Chief of Geh. graph 20), it may be mentioned that 259/10. a report reached His Majesty’s Govern- tliA ifHR To imr , „ . me nt, through the Tehran Legation, on , 1 ( V th .

He appears to have organised the trade and “ brought the Afghans down to the coast to receive the arms and take them “ away.” (Admiral Slade to Government of India, 30thMarch 1910, 620/10). On the 3rd February 1910, Mir Barkat had an interview with Admiral Slade, oqonQ on board the latter’s flagship at Jask, during which he promised to do all in his power to help in the suppression of the arms trade, and to use his influence with other Chiefs along the coast by writing to them and advising them to see the Admiral. But his professions were regarded with suspicion, and on the 9th March 1910, on representations from the British authorities, Mir Barkat was deported from Jask by the Darya Begi, the Persian Governor, and was taken by the latter to Bunder Abbas, where he made an ineffectual attempt to escape. The Darya Begi informed the British Consul at Bunder Abbas, on the 13th March 1910, that he would like to receive approval from Tehran to Barkat’s deportation and orders as to his further detention. Major Trevor asked the British Minister at Tehran to endeavour to arrange this with the Persian Government, with the result that Barkat was despatched to Bushire at the end of March. 60. On the 3rd February 1910, in view of reports that had appeared in the public press, it was thought advisable to warn the Government of India of the desirability “ for obvious reasons,” of giving the least possible publicity to the capture of arms in Persian territory. 61. On the 4th February Position of Bahrein and Koweit. Viceroy’s telegram of 4th February 1910 224/10. of 24th May 1900 1910, the Government of India reported that the arms dealers were beginning to remove their arms from Muskat to Koweit, and that the Admiral strongly urged that the Sheikh’s proclamation {see paragraph 13 and Appendix IX.), should be made widely known, and that the Sultan of Muskat should be asked to include Koweit dhows within the scope of his proclamation of January 1898 {see paragraph 8 and Appendix \I.). Both tue Admiral and Major Tievoi, the acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, considered it essential to search Koweit dhows, and to confiscate the arms and ammunition found on board them. Subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India proposed to issue orders “ that action may be taken under the “ Koweit proclamation outside Muskat territorial waters at once, and within “ those waters if Sultan of Muskat will issue necessary proclamation ; also “ that action be taken under Bahrein and Trucial Chiefs proclamation and notifications” {see paragraphs 10 and 14 and ? Appendices ATI. and ^ .). These proposals were approved by His Majesty s Government on the Hth HT* v 1910. • Major Trevor was instructed on the 20th February 1910 to warn Koweit c J of the intended action. He reported on the 8th March 1910 that the decision of Government had been communicated to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. In . tTP-r nared luc the Sheikh of Koweit had notified his readiness to abide by his proclamation, denied that any of his subjects were interested in the arms traffic, and promised to punish any Koweit who should disobey his orders and ship arms and ammunition Shei \r i rak added that he was prepared to give effect to any orders the lint's Govermnmit mighf give.* As Agar ds Bahrein, Major Trevor reported tha t ——- , ,, TTGAVe Sheikli of Koweit, it may be remarked that on the 11th ™ a dhow (tie “ Fateh-el-Khair’’) flying the May 1910 the Resident Feisia &gt; , 9 ^ G r firm) reac hed Koweit on the 27th April French flag, and pnrpoi r ifl °and 49 OOO^ounds of ammunition.

The actual quant.ty made over to the Political Agent was 301 rifles and 30,100 rounds of ammunition. Major Trevor to Government of India, 8th March 1910. 512/10. a letter dated the 2nd March 191036 Sheikh Isa had sent the following telegram on 6th March KUO to his Agent at MuskatKindly warn nakhodas oi Bahrein ships never to carry arms “ either to Bahrein or elsewhere. If they carry arms their ships will be tl oonfiseated and X will not listen to excuses. Major Trevor added that a warning had also been conveyed to the Trncial Chiefs. 62. In the same telegram (4th February 1910), the Government of India at the instance of Major Trevor, revived the suggestion (see paragraph 15) 13 -+-n-n nf that an agreement should be concluded Portion of Tuy. with Turkey “ authorising action against 'imo “ dhows which fly Turkish Flag in G 1Uai} ' ’ 3H4/10 “ Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf.” His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to whom this point was referred, anticipated no useful result from asking the Turkish Government to give us the right to search Turkish vessels. He feared that a reqriest of the kind “ would certainly be met by a polite ref usal, probably coupled with a promise “ that the Porte itself would send vessels to assist His Majesty s naval foices “ in the suppression of the trade. Supposing that some effort were made o “ carry out this promise, which is more than problematical, it is most unlikely “ that anything effectual would be done, while there would be the serious ns “ that the officers commanding the_ Turkish vessels would be apt to extend “ their activities to vessels belonging to subjects of native chiefs_ undei “ our protection, and so raise a number of questions Ia vl f v o± Sir G. Lowther’s observations, His Majesty s Government decided not to raise the question “until traffic_ in Turkish dhows becomes serious, and the Government of India were informed accoidmgiy on the 21st Marc 1910 Pending the reference to Constantinople, the Government of India had ° ni been instructed (17th February 1910) Status of El Katr t ows. that Turkish dhows should not be 540 / 10 - interfered with. Admiral Slade, in a telegram dated the 28th February 1910, enquired whether these orders applied to dhows belonging to El Katr and flying the Turkish colours, and whether such dhows should be held to be I urkish, and therefore exempt from seizure or interference. In reply, the Admiral was instructed by the Government of India, on the 9th March 1910, that the prohibition of His Majesty’s Government was understood to apply only to dhows “ coming from recognised Turkish territory,” and that dhows belonging to El Katr, even if flying the Turkish flag, might be seized if engaged in the illicit arms traffic, but that any arms or ammunition found on board them should not be destroyed without first referring to the Government of India. The Foreign Office, who were consulted informally on this point, expressed the view (in a demi-official letter dated the 14th April 1910) that the Government of India’s instructions to Admiral Slade were right, as Turkish sovereignty over El Katr had never been recognised by His Majesty’s Government. The caution was, added, however, that “ our naval officers can “ only board a vessel flying Turkish colours at their own risk, and must be “ prepared to take the consequences if the dhow turns out to be a bond fide “ Turkish vessel.” (As regards the status of the El Katr peninsula, see paragraph 15.) 63.

The dhow had no ship’s papers, but she belonged to Koweit and her cargo of arms and ammunition was consigned from M. Goguyer’s firm to a Koweit merchant. The nakhoda possessed a pass signed by the Sultan of Muskat authorising the transport of arms and ammunition within his territorial limits. After a careful inquiry by the Political Agent, the dhow was allowed to continue her journey on the ground that their was no reason to suppose that the cargo was intended for Persian territory. The Sultan of Muskat was informed accordingly. M. Goguyer’s Agent took up'the position that, on the strength of his conditional contract with the nakhoda, the dhow became his property on its seizure by a man-of-war, and he preferred a claim, through the French Consul at Muskat, for compensation- from His Majesty’s Government, including the cost of the dhow and the Koweit valuation of the arms, of which he now declined to take delivery. He also brought a charge that one of the dhow’s crew had been wounded by a British sailor, and accused the “ Hyacinth’s ” men of stealing certain baskets of sweetmeats from the dhow. The French firm’s representative told Mr. Holland at the same time that he was prepared to fight us in every possible way; that the Sultan s proclamation was waste paper in view of the French treaty, and that he would press this point on the French Government, and would in the mean while export arms to any place he wished, and hold the British Government responsible for any losses he might sustain. Hie krench Consul, m sub mitting Goguyer’s claim, asked for recognition on the grounds (1) that it was based on a French treaty still in force ; and (2) that the French Government had not concurred in the restrictive measures introduced by the Sultan. (&gt;4 The Government of India reported this incident in full in their telegram the 13th February 1910. They Vicei-oy’s telegram of 13th February pointed out that, as the dhow belonged ooq/io t0 Koweit, it was for the Sheikh of Koweit, if for anybody, to protest against her detention and the alleged wounding of one of her crew, and that M. Goguyer’s agent had no locus standi in the matter. Ihe agent s claim that Hie dhow became his property on her seizure could not be allowed, and was, in any case, not specifically supported by the drench Consul. In these circumstances they proposed to instruct Mr. Hoiiancl to reply to the French Consul that “ Government are unable to recognise that “ Goguyer has any claim to compensation from us for the temporary “ detention of his goods, or for the trifling damage caused to two packages “ which were opened for examination, in default of a bill of lading. the proposed instructions to Mr. Holland were approved by His^ Majesty s ^ ^ Government m Lord Morley s telegram Lord Morley’s telegram of 17th Feb- 0 f t p e 17th February 1910.

Mr. Holland added that Goguyer wxas negotiating for the^ purchase of another dhow, and that, according to the statement of the h rench Consul he intended to establish Agents wherever-possible on the Arabian coast, with a view to extending his business. 66 . Meanwhile the Sultan of Muskat. being, according to the report of the Political Agent, “ convinced that Untish “ Government intend to suppress arms “ traffic,” had hinted to Mr. Holland that he would be prepared to revoke his licenses, and to prohibit the im portation of arms and ammunition into Oman, on condition that the British Government would agree— (1.) To compensate him for the loss of revenue ; (2.) To support him against the French Government or any other I ower that might object to his action ; (3.) To arrange for the purchase at a reasonable price of the existing stocks of Muskat merchants. As regards condition No. (1), the Sultan sent Mr. Holland a statement showing that his average receipts for the last three years from the arms traffic worked out at about Rs. .15,000 a month (12,000L per annum).! Mr. Holland thought he would probably accept Rs. 10 ,000_ a month (8,000k a year) as compensation. The sum of 100,000k would, in Mr. Holland’s opinion, probably cover the cost of compensating the merchants. Mr. Holland also reported that the Sultan, in spite of his treaty with France, considered that he had the right, “ in virtue of his independence,” to stop the importation of arms and ammunition. 67. On the 13th February 1910 the Government of India reported that Mr. Holland w r as in favour of coming to Viceroy’s telegram of 13th February an arran geinent Oil the lines proposed 292/10 by the Sultan, and that this view was supported by Major Trevor, who pointed out that “ the Sultan has only now made overtures when he sees we are “ in earnest, and our action has temporarily paralysed the arms trade ” ; and that “ if His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sultan “ in prohibiting the import of arms w r e shall be able to impose on him any “ further condition w r e choose.” Mr. Holland urged on the 10th February 1910 that the Sultan would be liable to entangle himself with the French if a reply to his overtures were delayed ; but the Government of India doubted this, and pointed out that pressure could ahvays be applied to the Sultan by stopping his subsidy. They preferred to defer expressing their view's as to the policy to be adopted towards the Sultan until after the return of Major Cox.! I 11 fh° meanwhile they asked for early information as to the prospects of coming to terms with the French Government, and enquired whether the Sultan could be supported in the event of his prohibiting the import of arms into Muskat in the face of his treaty with France. 1910. 68 . The Secretary of State replied on the 20th February that the Foreign Office were being consulted in regard to France, but that in the mean while “ something might be done to restrict exports.” As a possible course, it was suggested, on the recommen dation of Major Cox, that the Sultan might be “ induced to declare Proposed further measures.

On the 21st February 1910 the Government of India were asked to consider the question of territorial concessions in India as a quid -pro quo in the event of negotiations with France. 69.

They considered that the blockade had, so far, been most successful, and that, if it was kept up, the trade would be ruined, “ whereas if we slacken our efforts now it will revive by the cold weather.” As regards the definite proposals which had been made, they expressed their views to the following effect:— (1.) They considered it unnecessary at present to supplement the blockade by a system of “passes” as suggested in the Secretary of State’s telegram of 20th February (see paragraph 68), the Naval Commander-in-Ohief being convinced that smugglers would devise means of circumventing any “pass” system, and that “ nothing short of a total prohibition of export is of practical use “ or worth paying Sultan for.” (2.) As regards an arrangement with France, the Government of India stated that they were considering the question of possible terri torial concessions in India, but that, in view of the success of the blockade and of the proposals they were about to submit, they were now of opinion that it would lie better to avoid communi cating with the French Government until the blockade operations had had their full effect in killing the trade.” The proposals they desired to submit, at the instance of the Admiral and Colonel Cox, were that “ we should now concentrate “ all our efforts upon the maintenance of effective blockade on “ Persian coast. This would be greatly promoted by temporary “ installation of wireless telegraphy at Debai, Bahrein, ^ and “ Bushire. We could then leave Muskat entirely alone, and simply “ deal with dhows in Persian waters or with cargoes when landed, “ our system of intelligence being now so good. (In this way, by “ acting as agents of Persia in stopping the import of arms under “ the Agreement of 1897, and not acting so for our own benefit, we “ should avoid international complications with France or other “ Powers.”) (8) As regards reassuring the Sultan, all that the Government of India 1 considered necessary was that the Political Officers should watch his attitude and “just give him sufficient comfort to keep him from intriguing with France or Germany.” They considered that no definite sum should be promised or mentioned to him, but that for the present Colonel Cox might simply tell him orally, when passing through Muskat, that we are obliged to perse\ ere with “ extermination of trade on Persian coast, but will not allow him to “ p,e ruined in the process.” They were altogether against giving compensation to arms dealers. They added that the Admiral would reduce the cost of the operations to the utmost, and that considerable reduction would be possible “both during height of hot season^ and as trade becomes gradually attenuated by our operations.” Incidentally, they observed that the blockade operations were greatly promoting our influence and strengthening our hands in the Gulf generally.40 70. The views of the Government of India as to (1) passes, and (2) the proposed communication to the Lord Morley’s telegram of 21st March g u ltan were approved by His Majesty’s L0 ' 3097/10 Government on the 21st March 1910. As regards the proposed wdreless in stallations, the Government of India were instructed to telegraph the estimated cost before taking any action. 1910. As regards France, the Government of India were informed that the “ French Consul’s action in facilitating purchase of dhow for arms traffic “ will now be made ground of strong representation to French Government, “ who will be urged to assist His Majesty’s Government by permitting Sultan “ to prohibit import for one year, and our ships to search French dhows “ during that period, just as we are assisting French in preventing arms “ traffic with Morocco. This should not cause any abatement of rigour of blockade, but it must be borne in mind that we have no right even to “ touch French dhows except in British waters.” The Government of India were also instructed, with reference to orders recently issued by the Naval Commander-in-Chief as to searching dhows Hying the French flag, to remind the Admiral that “ the orders of 1867 ” (relative to merchant ships suspected of fraudulently using the French colours) “ only permit of stopping of dhows flying French flag where there is presumption that she is wrongfully flying it.” [It should be added that subsequently, in a letter dated the 15th April 1910 (3238/10), the Foreign Office pointed out that the orders of 1867 related solely to slave trade operations, and were not applicable to the case of vessels engaged in the arms traffic. The Government of India were instructed (18th April 1910) to warn the Admiral accordingly.] The Government of India were, however, authorised, if they thought it practicable, to act on a suggestion made in a letter dated 24th February 1910 from the India Office to the Foreign Office, viz. to urge the Sheikhs of Xoweit, Bahrein and Mohammerah, and the Trucial Chiefs, to seize any consignments of arms landed in their respective territories (whether by dhows flying the French flag or otherwise), and to hand them over to the British authorities, “ His Majesty’s Government undertaking to support the “ Sheikhs and Chiefs in case of any unpleasantness with the French, and, if “ necessary, to give compensation for the arms, or to restore them ultimately “ to the local rulers, when assured that there is no risk of their merely “ passing into the hands of the dealers.” Memorandum to French Government. Proposal to prohibit imports at Muskat for one year. SirE. Grey to Sir F. Bertie, dated 30tli March 1910. 3164/10. 1. Ihe proposed representations to the French Government were embodied in a Memorandum, which was sent to the British Ambassador at Paris on the 30th March 1910, for communi cation to the French Minister for Foreign Affairs. This Memorandum, after setting out in some detail the history of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, laid stress upon the serious situation which had been created in Southern Persia, and still more in Afghanistan and on the North West frontier of India, by the wholesale supply to the tribesmen of modern arms and ammunition. “No Govern ment,” the Memorandum proceeded, “ can tolerate or be expected to “ tolerate a situation such as this, or passively to watch the growth of a “ trade which threatens to subvert the order and well-being which that “ Government is bound to uphold; a trade, moreover, which only exists “ to-day in defiance of the wishes openly proclaimed of the Rulers of Muskat “ and of the neighbouring States, owing to the chance wording of a Treaty over sixty years old, drawn up at a time when the traffic in arms had not been foreseen and did not exist even in the imagination of the framers of “ the treaty, though had it done so, the whole history of international“ relations in modem times leaves no doubt tliat it would have been expressly “ excluded.” 0 The Memorandum explained that His Majesty’s Government had hoped that the result of the recent Arms Conference at Brussels would have been to enable them to cope with this evil, but that as the results of the Conference had been merely negative in regard to Muskat, they had been compelled to devise other means of dealing with the situation. The French Government were no doubt aware of the “ serious and costly steps ” recently taken with a view to checking the traffic at its source. These measures had been attended with considerable success and were in a fair way to achieving the object aimed at, when His Majesty’s Government “ learned to their great “ concern that the French Consul at Muskat had facilitated the despatch of “ cargoes of arms by a French citizen on a dhow, and possibly other dhows, “ flying the French flag, in order by this means to evade the patixd now “ being carried out by His Majesty’s Ships.” The Memorandum reminded the French Government of the “friendly co-operation ” recently rendered by His Majesty’s Government in stopping a similar illicit traffic in arms off the coast of Morocco,! and expressed the earnest hope that France would co operate in the same friendly manner in putting an end to a trade which “ entails grave danger to the tranquillity of the British Indian Empire and “ great prejudice to British interests on the Indian frontier. 72. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government, “ confident in the “ readiness of the Government of the Republic to accede to so legitimate a “ demand,” made the following proposals : ( 1 .) ( 2 .) ( 3 .) That the Sultan of Muskat should be empowered to prohibit the import of arms and ammunition into Muskat for a period of one year from the 1st June 1910. That instructions should be given to the French Consul at Muskat “ to abstain from any steps tending to facilitate the tiaffic in arms “ and ammunition with the coasts of the Persian Gulf. That the right of search at present exercised by His Majesty’s Government over Muskat and Persian dhows m Muskat terri torial waters should be extended _ so as to cover dhows undei the French flag for the same period of one year from the 1st June 1910. 73 Sir Francis Bertie was instructed to take the first opportunity of D communicating the above Memorandum Sir F. Bertie to Sir E. Grey, dated ^ ]r renc p Minister for Foreign 5tli April 1910. Affairs, and at the same time to impress 3241 / 10 - upon M. Pichon the importance which HG Maiestv’s Government attached to receiving an early reply. In con versa- tion with the British Ambassador on the 4th April M Pichon, after referring to the difficulties in the way of accepting the British proposals, said that i mio-ht be possible for the French Government to consent to the prohibition of the import of arms and ammunition into Muskat for the proposed period of one vZ “from about two months later than the date suggested by His Maiestv’s Government,” i.e., from about the beginning of August 19 0), i , fir bis Concession would be “with the view to giving time for a general ^settlement of the question.” As regards the search of dhows under ?h7 Tench flag by British ships of war, M.

The whole subject, he said, would have to be discussed with the Minister for the Colonies and brought before the Cabinet. 74 On the 22nd April 1910 the Government of India weie lequested , , x , 09 , A •! to state their views by telegraph as Lord Morley s telegram, 22nd Apni 1910. t0 ' 3241/10. (1 ) The value of one year’s prohibition under the conditions suggested by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs ; (9) The question of a quid pro quo in the event of His Majesty s Go\ern- ment finding it necessary to admit the French claims; (3j The “ possibility of devising any scheme whereby, in co-operation ‘‘ with France, legitimate imports for local consumption could be “ provided for, and export to prohibited countries prevented.” Renewed activity of arms dealers. Colonel Cox to Government of India, 23rd and 27th April 1910. 728/10. 5 Major Trevor, who had succeeded Mr. Holland as Political Agent at Muskat, reported on the 23rd April 1910 that the arms dealers were again becoming more active, and that orders were appa rently being placed in Europe. He was inclined (telegram dated 27th April 1910) to attribute this renewed activity to the dealers having got wind of the proposal to prohibit imports for a year from the 1st August, and consequently wishing to import large quantities of arms before that date. Colonel Cox (telegram of 27th April 1910) thought that the dealers’ action was to be accounted for by the statements to which prominence had been given in various English newspapers, to the effect that the blockade arrangements were to be suspended until the winter. 76. The Government ,of: India, Views of Government of India. Viceroy’s telegram of 19th May 1910. 739/10. after consulting the Political Agent, Muskat, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Naval Commander-in- Chief, replied by telegraph on the 19th May 1910 to the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 22nd April 1910 (see paragraph 74). They pointed out that the present position was a strong one, that the trade had been seriously checked by the blockade, and that there was reason to hope that it might in time be killed altogether. At the same time everything depended on the goodwill of Persia, and an awkward situation would arise if French dhows were to start running in any numbers. They did not consider the risk great, at present, on either score, but it could not be ignored. They would have preferred, as recommended in their telegram of the 14th March 1910 (see paragraph 69), not to have approached the French Government until the trade had been killed by the blockade, but, as the communication to France had actually been made, they had reconsidered the situation and now recom mended (1) that the blockade should continue with full rigour ; and (2) that meantime an attempt should be made to get France to “ show her hand ” and to indicate what quid pro quo she required. As regards the three specific points raised in the Secretary of State’s telegram 'of the 22nd April 1910 (see paragraph 74), the Government of India expressed their views to the following effect:— (1.) They considered the prohibition of imports for a year, without the right of search, and “ after an interval which allows Muskat to be flooded with arms and ammunition,” to be per se of little practical value. But the moral effect would be considerable if France really meant to find a permanent and reasonable settlement. The whole question, in the Government of India’s opinion, turned on the nature of the quid pro quo.^ as Hy em it at t910 iiing ppa- was ipril Ethe mtly Cox ) be q in ;ent, ’sian r-in- the i of ated )een at it .ded mcb the ley 910 the nee am- hat md te’s of the to [tie if nt. ied 43 (2.) They considered it necessary to be very cautious in regard to compen sation for the present, and were not prepared to say more than that they would gladly give reasonable compensation to secure a really permanent settlement. They believed that the trade would be killed by the naval blockade, but the process was costly and liable to cause friction. They would welcome a reasonable settlement which would relieve them of the cost and trouble of a blockade. As regards cession of territory, the Government of India reported (after consultation with the Madras Government) that there were no “ physical difficulties ” in ceding a considerable area round Pondi cherry and “rounding off” the French possessions. But they considered that no such cession should be made without an exchange in respect of other parcels of French territory in India, and would wish in any case to make further inquiries before expressing a final opinion. (3.) They agreed with the view expressed by the Resident in the Persian Gulf that it would be necessary to purchase the consent of France and of the Sultan to the regulation by us of imports and exports at Muskat. They had no doubt that a practicable scheme could be devised. Finally, they suggested that it would be of great con venience if the French Government were to send an officer to India to carry on all preliminary negotiations. 77. It should perhaps be added that both the Admiral and Colonel Cox were fully agreed that, even if the ^ Views of Admiral a nd Resident, Pcrsmn proposed prohibition for one year were carried into effect, it would still be necessary to maintain the blockade at its present strength in order to keep out arms and ammunition already stored at Muskat or elsewhere. The Admiral deprecated any suggestion of territorial concession, being of opinion that, provided Persia remained well-disposed, the situation could be dealt . i • i cn j x rx with quite effectively without the as- Admiral Slade to Government o± India, . , ^ T j! &gt;» i i i 5th May 1910. sistance oi firance. 11, he proceeded, 740 10 “ we kill market by frightening off and “ preventing customers from coming to “ it, or by preventing them from taking deliveries of goods even if they “ succeed in coming, then the trade will cease, whether it is bolstered up by “ France or not.” Colonel Cox’s view was that, as the blockade was succeeding so well, no “ expensive palliative measures ” should be proceeded with until it had reached its point of greatest effect, and that another attempt should then be made to settle the whole Muskat question with France. He considered that the refusal of the French to grant the right of search afforded good grounds for withdrawing from the negotiations for one year’s prohibition, and recommended that this should be done, and that further oveituies should be dropped until the spring of 1911, when the “maximum effect _ of the blockade would have been achieved. iVs regards the question of mdemm- fyin o 1 arms dealers at Muskat by purchasing their stocks, Colonel Cox was of opimon that such an undertaking might prove “ enormously expensive, and should, if possible, be avoided. The contingency should, m any case only be entertained in the event of the Treaty of 1844 (see paragraph 9 and Appendix II.) being effectively modified. He pointed out that, so long as contraband traffic only was suppressed, vendors deserved no compensation. 78 On the 7th June 1910 the Government of India asked for sanction to continue the blockade till December 1910, when they proposed to review the situation again.

( 1 ). Note from Mr. C. Hardmge, British Minister at Tehran, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated llth December 1897. Her Majesty’s Government have information that large quantities of arms and ammunition are being exported from Great Britain to the southern ports of Persia and also to Muskat and Bahrein, from which places they are smuggled across into Persia. J Her Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that a considerable portion of these consignments find their way into Afghanistan, and eventually reach the tribes on the North-west Frontier of India. The importation of arms into Persia being 'strictly prohibited, this traffic is illegal, and as contiaij to 1 ersian as it is to British interests. I have therefore received instructions from the Marquess of Salisbury to enquire of Your Excellency whether, with a view to stopping this illicit traffic, the Persian Government will allow Her Majesty’s ships of war to seize and hand ovei to the I ersian authorities for confiscation all cargoes of arms and ammunition owned by British or Persian subjects which may be found in Persian waters destined for importation into Persia. In the event of the importation of arms and ammunition for the use of the Persian Government a notification to Her Majesty’s Legation would be sufficient to prevent seizure by Her Majesty’s ships. I am also instructed to enquire of the Persian Government whether they will join Her Majesty’s Government in requesting the Sultan of Muskat to issue a notice warning his subjects and others residing in Muskat from exporting arms and ammunition to Persia or British India, as the importation of such merchandise into those countries is strictly prohibited, and asking that British ships of war may be permitted to take action in the waters o^f Muskat for preventing such traffic by the subjects of Great Britain, Persia, and Muskat. I shall be much obliged if Your Excellency will favour me with an early reply for communication to Her Majesty’s Government. y n e s ( 2 .) Note from the Sadr-i-Azam to Mr. G. Hardinge i British Minister at Tehran, dated 18th December 1897. Your letter on the prevention of the importation of arms and ammunition, written in accordance with instructions from Lord Salisbury, has been received and submitted to the appreciation of His Majesty the Shah. The opinion of the British Government that the importation of arms and ammunition into Persia should be strictly prohibited, is shared by the Persian Government. This Government has always sought to prevent the arming of the tribesmen as well as the inhabitants of the towns and frontiers. Since, in this matter, the opinions of the two Governments are in unison, and as the measures to be taken are in many respects similar, the Govern ment is prepared with the most perfect unanimity to meet the views of Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation ; further, the wishes of Her Majesty’s Govern ment, viz., that in addition to such measures as may be taken by Persian officials, Her Majesty’s ships should examine and search all merchant vessels trading in the Persian Gulf, and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board, are approved by His Imperial Majesty the Shah. Should arms or ammunition be purchased to the order of the Persian Government, information of such purchases will be given to Her Britannic Majesty’s Legation, so that such arms may be beyond the effects of the prohibition.48 The Persian Government is also ready to join with Her Majesty s Government in requesting the Sultan of Muskat to notify m the ports and territories of Muskat that arms should not be imported from that side into Persia or Hindustan, also that English ships should exercise in regard to search and confiscation the same rights m Muskat as m Persian waters. APPENDIX VI. (Muskat Agreement, 1898.) ( 1 .) Letter from the Sultan of J\Iushat to the Political liesident in the 1 ei siau Gulf, dated I2&gt;th January 1898 (After compliments.) Your esteemed letter of yesterday’s date has arrived, together with the draft copy of the Notification ; we have accepted it and we shall publish it; a cony of it is (herewith) sent to you. As to the second draft, we have already sent to you a letter containing our compliance with what you desire in respect of preventing the sending of arms and ammunition to the two countries—India and Persia—as is plainly stated in the_ Notification. We have complied with it most willingly ; and we associate with the British and Persian Governments in the arrangements that are made and will be hereafter made for the suppression of this trade in arms and ammunition. With regard to what you have hinted to us, about representing this matter to the great Government in the best way possible, so that we should be (not only) guaranteed against any loss, but (also) derive benefit by what we are doing to help the Government, we shall most gladly exert to the utmost in that matter, and we firmly believe that the Government and yourself will not be pleased with any loss to us. We shall thank the Government and yourself for that. May you always remain in a good state. And salaams. ( 2 .) Notification by the Sultan of Muskat, dated 13th January 1898. Be it known to such of our subjects as see this that, whereas the British and Persian Governments have represented to us that they are desirous of preventing introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia, and that there is reason to think that many are exported from Muskat and taken to those two above-named countries, we have resolved to join them and to assist them as far as it lies in our power in suppressing this trade in arms and ammunition between Muskat and India and Persia. We therefore warn (our subjects) that all the arms and ammunition sent to those two countries will be confiscated, and those engaged in the trade will be punished, as the introduction of arms and ammunition into India and Persia is prohibited by the Governments of those two countries, and, therefore, illegal. In future our Muskat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying the said arms and ammunition from our dominions to India and Persia. (This is written) that it may be known.

(Powers of Search and Detention by His Majesty’s ships.) ao Circular instructions issued by the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, to Captains, Commanders, and Officers Commanding His Majesty s ships employed on the East Indies Station, and all others concerned, dated the 28th October 1909. 1. The following instructions on the rights of visit, search, and detention of vessels by His Majesty’s ships are communicated for information and guidance. 2. Under the General Act of the Brussels Conference, 1890, His Majesty’s ships are invested with the powers of visit, search, and detention over vessels suspected of being engaged in, or equipped for, the slave trade, under54 \ I certain conditions wliiclr are laid down in the “ Instructions to Naval Officers employed in the Suppression of the Slave Trade ” (pages 2 to 13). 3. Articles VIII. to XIII. of the General Act prohibit the importation of firearms and ammunition into the territories therein specified, but the Brussels Act does not of itself confer any powers of search or detention for the enforcement of the articles quoted. 4. Such rights as His Majesty’s ships possess to search and detain vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic are derived from local regulations when the vessels are m British territorial waters, and from agreements made with certain Foreign States when the vessels are in their respective territorial waters. His Majesty s ships have not authority to seaich upon the high seas vessels suspected of being engaged in the arms traffic, in the absence of treaties with other Powers, and in the case of British vessels, of an Act of the Imperial Parliament. 5. The rights of His Majesty’s ships in this connection are summarised in the annexed statement. ( 2 .)

S. “ Proserpine.” 2 . In consideration of the fact that the rifles and carbines captured were made over to the Government of India, we agree to some contribution being made from Indian revenues towards the grant which it is proposed to make, and we leave it to Your Lordship to settle the amount which should be paid. 3, With regard to the remarks made in the Admiralty letter No. N.L.- 2432, dated the 17th April 1909, as to the value of the arms, we would observe that the rates of Rs. 41 for rifles and Rs. 32 for carbines, quoted therein, are correct so far as their sale value at Mascat is concerned. But as. they are unstryigeable to us we consider that their value may be assessed under Army Regulations, India, Volume II, Appendix XV, at Rs. 3-6-8 for each rifle and Rs. 2-10-8 for each carbine.

Enquiry is made whether some contribution will be allowed by the Indian Government in respect of the rifles and carbines captured and handed over to your officers, and I request that.1 may be furnished, at an early date, with your views on this point, and also as to the amount at which such contribution, if given, should be calculated. Beyond a contribution based on the value of the arms captured, I do not consider that Indian revenues should bear any share of the grant to be finally made.

Details of the capture are contained in a letter of the 20th April 1908, from the Commanding Officer of the ship, a copy of which was forwarded to the India Office by Admiralty letter of the 26th May 1908, M 5011. ^ 2. My Lords are of opinion that the services rendered by the officers and crew of the “ Proserpine ” were such as to justify a grant from public funds, but, before taking further steps in the matter, they would be glad to be informed whether the Secretary of State would he prepared to authorise some contribution being made by the Indian Government in respect of 836 rifles of English manufacture, and 82 Martini-Henry carbines, which formed a portion of the captured cargo and were handed over to the Indian Government at their request. 3. According to an estimate given by His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat the rifles in question were worth Rs. 45 each, and the carbines Rs. 30 each, but further inquiries indicate that the true value of new weapons of these patterns is Rs. 41 and Rs. 32 respectively, A different estimate is given by the Indian Government in the enclosed copy of a letter to the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station, but it would appear that the figures there mentioned are the lowest quoted in the rate book for arms of this description, being their estimated value after 11 years’ service.

As for the value of the 82 carbines, the Government of India are advised that as they are not of Government pattern and cannot be utilised, they are only fit for breaking up and are therefore valued at Rs. 12-7-u, the estimated value of the material which will be recovered from the whole; but that for estimating their value for prize money it might be fairer to assess it at ks. 2-10-8 each, the value after 10 years in use of tne corresponding Government weapons.

At daylight on the 13th March a dhow was seen by the steam-cutter off Ras-ash-Shir to the northward making in for the land, and a course was steered to intercept her, and when still nearly a mile away the crew of the dhow opened lire and then abandoned her, continuing to fire as they pulled in towards the shore, which shoals here nearly 2 miles out. Lieutenant Briggs returned the fire with the Maxim, and, having driven them inshore, went alongside the dhow and found her with a cargo of arms and ammunition.

In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his letter Major Webb-Ware has brought to notice the parts played by Captain Grant, Lieutenant Tate, Jemadar Bajwali, 4 Thanadar Sharbat Khan and others in the above-mentioned operations, and with these remarks I am in entire accord. I am also of opinion that great credit is due to Major Webb-Ware for the prompt and able measures which he took from the commencement and to which, I consider, subsequent results are largely due. 3 The conduct of the troops and of the levies in very trying circum stances has been shown to have been admirable, and I strongly support the sugges tion made by the Political Agent to give some pecuniary reward both to the troops and the levies ; I am of opinion that the latter might suitably be given whatever reward may be decided on as suitable, for the former I would submit that the reward might equitably be given to the whole Military Detachment at Robat Z all were called on to perform arduous duties in closing the various routes by which caravans could come, not only in the case of the first and second caravans, but also in the case of a reported third caravan which was expected for many days, but which never came. In paragraph 11 the Political Agent brings to notice the good work done bv the Telegraph Masters at the various offices along the line I am forwarding a ?opy of these remarks for the information of the Director-General of Telegraphs. 4 As regards the disposal of the arms and ammunition I propose to deposit 4.

With reference to the ^'ihThononr foTubmiMor No. S.- 22 , dated the f ^ ^^^ General’s mforrnatK.n. a report on the ttsSfand attempted passage across the western extremity of the Chagm St of the two arms caravans referred to therem. „ r, rto intb Anril you transmitted a communication to me that two 2. arms amUmmunition have left Jagin, presumably for Afghan- rX^Onttudylg the matter, the conclusion I came to was that these caravans istan. un sruuy u g p PT a n Afghan frontier somewhere in the vicimtv would P r ? ba ^7 a r^ P cararan made the passage last year. I accord' 'itewareed the Thanadfr Saindak and the Rassaldar at Eobat to keep a care- Ul fook out and in addition I forwarded a copy of your communication to the Officer Commanding the Eobat Escort. Dispositions were also made to obtain information. it a little after 11 o’clock a.m. on the 27th April, I was called to the Tele- nh Office Dalhandin. by information that the Thanadar Saindak had a matter ^rurgency to communicate. This proved to be that news had just come m by runner from Kacha that a large arms caravan accompanied by a strong escort Titehans armed with breech-loading rifles, had arrived, a few hours previously, at Kacha Thana eti route to Band-i-Kamal Khan, and that it was them intention to halt a few hours and then proceed via Kacha Gorge to Godar-i-Shah, on the sLw river For their protection they had thrown out sentries and pickets and had blocked all roads leading from Kacha In answer to a query I put the Tbsnadar reported that he had six men available, and he requested instructions as to how he was to proceed. I directed him to take his men and marching as rapidly as possible to seize the northern exit of the Kacha Gorge. It was obvious that with the small force at his disposal and m the face ot such numbers, he could not single-handed, be expected to effect much : he was therefore instructed to impress on his men to direct their fire at the caravan s camels, and I pointed out to him that his duties were strictly confined to doing all in his power to disable them and to delay the caravan until help arrived from Robat. The Thanadar left at once. I then called up Captain Grant, and informing him of the news I had received and the dispositions made to delay the caravan, I requested him to transmit orders to the Rassaldar, Robat, to move bis four levies with the utmost speed they were capable of to Kacha Gorge and on arrival there to form a junction with the Saindak levies, and I further asked this officer to despatch a party of rifles to assist. These orders were carried out with commendable promptitude. The Robat levies moved off at once, and thirty minutes later they were followed by Lieutenant Tate with a party of 50 rifles. The Saindak levies under Sharbat Khan reached the position assigned to them about 10 p.m. The moon was up, but a wind from the north, suffused with finely divided dust, obscured the sur roundings. There were no signs of the caravan having passed, and after waiting an hour and becoming apprehensive that it might have taken a different route Thanadar Sharbat Khan despatched a levy up the gorge to reconnoitre, with instructions to fire his carbine should he meet the caravan in motion. The wisdom of this step is questionable, for, as will be seen, its only result was to put the caravan on its guard. The levy had not gone long when the report of his carbine was heard, followed, shortly after, by shouts from the caravan, as the sarwans urged their camels forward down the gorge. Already on the alert the caravan advanced towards the exit prepared to bear down any opposition it might encounter. Throw-ing out strong bodies of men on either side the latter masked the levies’ fire by the heavy fire they brought to bear in return, and under cover of this they rushed the mouth of the gorge, so far as the dust haze permitted the levies to see, in a series of detached bodies. A man was heard to cry out, and subsequent reports tend to show that two Afghans were wounded, one of whom has since succumbed, and three are missing. In addition to this two or three camels are said to have been hit by bullets, hollowing the passage of the last detachment Sharbat Khan, whose men had by this time expended nearly all their ammunition, moved dovn whh two levies imo the gf rge. Here they came across ttreemen vhom they tock hr the Robat levies who had come up too late to get into their correct position, but not too late to take part in the fight. A volley, however, disillusioned them, and the levies throwing themselves on the ground returned the fire ly shot, with the eventual result that they put their adversaries to flight. A package con taining 2,900 rounds of ammunition packed in small boxes bearing the name of Kynock was picked up in the gorge, and splashes of blood were found which testified to the fact that the levies’ fire had not been wholly ineffective. Lieu tenant Tate and his party of infantry reached Chah Muhammad Raza at 2-30 a.m. 27-28, and after two hours’ halt, to rest his men, pressed on to the point where the Kacha-Garmsel track crosses the Baluch-Afghan frontier, but, beyond finding some unfired rounds of ammunition and coming across more blood-marks, he saw no traces of the caravan. The heat on the 27th was excessive: indeed at midday the thermometer at Robat registered 98 degrees in the shade. -Mr. Tate’s party covered 62 miles m 22 hours, a feat which I think the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General, who is personally acquainted with the nature of this country and its climate, will agree reflects high credit on this officer s energy and determination and that of the men he commanded. I would express a hope that Lieutenant Tate’s plucky march in this extreme heat may be brought under the notice of the military authorities. His disappointment and that of his men that they arrived too late was keen : but far from thinking that any blame attaches, I consider that he is deserving of great praise and that he did all that lay in his power. 3. The following particulars regrrding this caravan are of interest. Its strength was 200 camels and 80 men, all of whom were armed, and its head man was a Kharoti Ghilzai named Muhammad Jan. From the enquiries wine have been made on the Helmand it would appear that Muhammad Jan proceeded winter to Karachi and from thence to a place the name of which is given as'being “ Kardan.” Leaving his camels, of which he was then accompanied bv 120 , at this place he crossed the Gulf to Maskat where the Pychase o the ’as effected From Maskat the rifles were passed across the Gulf, n tTusual way, being b, 1 hi, 'Vh.

Meanwhile the head of ^ caravan reached the exit to be met with a well directed magazine fire from the infantry lying concealed, with the result that 23 camels were killed and 31 captured together with 40 loads of arms and ammunition. The Afghan escort did no a n their property passively, for they scattered into the hills on either si e an a cover fought most determinedly until the afternoon. At 4 p.m. e g an give ground and a little later the infantry and levies were able to advance an take possession of their capture and remove it to Robat.

The levies removed their capture to - ain ^ a without mishap : hut on the road they fell in with a party of Afghans v ° come down to a spring and attacking these they drove them back into the niiis. Investigation of the property captured showed it to be as follows A,—Saindak Levies—Z01 arms of different types and 13,500 rounds of ammu nition (this latter total includes 2,900 rounds captured from the first caravan). rB.—Infantry .—493 rifles of various types and'51,400 rounds of ammu nition, giving a total with (A), according to reports received, of 794 rifles and 62,000 jdus 2,900, or 64,900 rounds of ammunition. In addition to this, a small sum of money in krans was found in a khurjin and several papers, a list of which is attached. In the course of the fight, several hags of cartridges were struck by rifle fire and exploded, and the wood-work of two loads of rifles suffered de struction from fire which originated in the same way. I forward separately specimens of the several types of cartridges captured and also labels taken from various packages of ammunition. These latter are not wholly representative, as many thousand rounds were found, loose, packed in bags, and bear no labels of any description. The arms were secured in gunny bags, khurjins, blankets, etc., and the following names are repeated on several of the packages in the Urdu character, viz. :— 1. Muhammad Jan. 2. Sahib Jan. 3. Abdul Wahab. 4. Zarif Khan. 5. Afu Khan. 6. Khan. This first named Muhammad Jan is no doubt the same man who is referred to in the paragraph 2 above in connection with No. 1 caravan: indeed it now ap pears that the caravans originally started from the coast in company and sepa rated as the result of a quarrel. I have not received a detailed report from Cap tain Grant with regard to the second caravan, but I attach two interesting letters in w r hich he describes the various types of arms which fell into his hands which appear, in general characteristics, to correspond closely with those captured by the levies. It is difficult to say with any degree of accuracy what the Afghan losses in killed amounted to. Their guide, a Salarzai Baluch, named Rodan, whose services they had enlisted at Khari, was killed early in the fight. A few r men, some 18 in all, have reached Garmsel and state that their losses in killed and wounded amounted to 20. This number is probably accurate as it corresponds, generally, with the reports which have come in from other quarters. A few camels broke back into a side nulla and eventually appear to have found their way out of the hills, for 8 are lying dead a few miles north of the trade route, and travellers from the Helmand testify to having seen the bodies of many more dead camels on the route. Such reports as have come m show that no camels reached the Helmand alive, and that the Afghans, who did reach Garmsel did so in a miserable plight, starving, with only their personal arms aIld w ^hout any ammunition. There is some reason for believing that a few rifles were buried during 1 the flight and steps are being taken to ascertain whether this was so and to recover them. 5 Rifles sell in the districts bordering this Agency at from Rs. 80 to Rs. 150. I think that we are therefore justified in taking Rs. 100 as bemg a fair average trice per weapon. At this rate the 794 rifles would represent a sum of Rs. 79,400. mi i partridges captured, at a low estimate, is Rs. 7,000.

I trust detachment is due to the excellent posi- That n °. c ^ s t a ^ le i S JtM^and th^cove^wlikh heprepared. There is some reason tion which h « f/ ar ,; a “ inc luded a party of Afridis. During the fight J?mX°ItafwaU reports that he heard the “retire,” “assembly,” and “advance” Jemadar Jtajwai p wou i d testify to the presence of ex-sepoys, and from Garmset I have received information that some of the fugitives who reached there are of a caste of Pathans who have not yet been seen in that country. If this information should prove correct, it may possibly explain the stubborn- ness of the opposition which Jemadar Rajwah met and overcame. 7 I have referred to the important part which Thanadar Sharbat Khan and his six levies took. His plans were admirably laid, he displayed great intel ligence in obtaining early and accurate information and the advice he gave to Jemadar Rajwali and the Robat levies was excellent; moreover the posmon he selected with a view to preventing any part of the caravan breaking back was chosen with great judgment and discrimination. He fought an independent action extending from early morning until night fall, opposed to superior numbers under cover, and that he finally drove them off was due to the dogged pluck, and the tenacity he and his men displayed. Thanadar Sharbat Khan is. m point of service, the oldest native officer in the Chagai levies. He has a long and honourable record to his credit, and it was mi intention to bring his services to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General’s notice next year m the hope that they might be°adequately recognised; I would suggest that the recent services‘which he has rendered might now be advantageously rewarded. Captam Grant has written that he considers that the destruction of the caravan was largely due to the initiative which Thanadar Sharbat Kban displayed, and that this is the case the account I give proves beyond doubt. Ido, the Kirtaka Duffadar, rendered great assistance to Thanadar Sharbat Khan with whom he was closely associated' , throughout the fight, and I would propose that he be rewarded separately by a sanad and a khillat of Rs. 100. 8. I was somewhat disappointed by the part taken by the Robat levies on the occasion of the passage of the first caravan, as I consider that they might have gained their position at Kacha with more rapidity: however they took part with the infantry in the second fight and fought determinedly throughout, givirg valuable support to Jemadar Rajwali. During the fight with the second caravan the Saindak levies lost a camel and some other petty articles of property, in all valued at some Rs. 95. I would recommend that this may be made good. 9. In view of the high value of the arms which have been captured I would enquire whether it would be feasible to give the infantry and levies concerned some reward in the form of a grant or batta ? The wear and tear to animaR and uniforms scrambling up and down rocks have not been inconsiderable, and all have suffered very real hardships from the marching and countermarching in the extreme heat which prevailed. 10. In regard to future arms caravans, I would ask that I may be accorded permission to station two secret service agents at a favourable point in Sarhad. Both these caravans travelled from Bazman via Galichah, marching further on by a route which is rarely used. We know little what is going on in this particular part of Sarhad, and experience has shown that it is difficult to obtain accurate and early information. In my Diary No. 45, dated 8th December, paragraph 4, I made a suggestion on this subject, and I would now ask that it may be favourably considered. I would note that information regarding the first caravan reached Robat a few hours after it came into Kacha, but unfortunate ly too late to be of any service. The cost of two secret agents would merely amount to Rs. 12 per man 'per mensem, or Rs. 288 per annum and they might nominally be attached to Robat as Khassadars.Taj-ud-din, Robat Qa im Aii, Saindak. ...i hammad Khan, Dalbandin. Muhammad VVaz r Khan, Padag, 11. Be fore elesmg tliis rsport I e’esira to express my oKigatiens lo the Telegraph Masters, Robat, Saindak, Dalban- din, and Padag. The dispositions to meet these caravans were made by calling the persons concerned into the telegraph offices and explaining in detail over the wires how they must proceed. Captain Grant has brought to my notice the great assistance which the Telegraph Master at Robat, B. Taj-ud-din, and his assistant, Muhammad Abdul Aziz, rendered him, and I can endorse this from personal knowledge. On the Telegraph Masters named in the margin many hours' hard work was thrown, and I can testify to the cheer fulness and willingness with which they responded, for on two occasions I was compelled to make use of the wires for 5 and 6 hours, respectively. My thanks are also due to the Telegraph Master, Nushki, who showed equal readiness to assist when it was believed that a third caravan was moving alon g the same route. I w^ould ask that the assistance that these Telegraph Masters rendered may be brought to the notice of their departmental head. 12. I would be favoured with early instructions as to the disposal of these arms on their arrival in Quetta. No. R.-202 (Confidential), dated Robat Killa, the 7th May 190/. From— Captain W. 0.
