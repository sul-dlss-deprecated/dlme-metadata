I hav« th« honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's letter of the 25rd Rabi'-al-Thani, 1335,= 16th February 19 17, in which Your Excellency stated that you were unable to allow the opening of a Branch of the Eastern Bank in Bahrain as the transactions of a bank are carried out on a system of interest which is unlawful according to Islamic law and that the local courts are Shara* and Customary which do not decree in favour of persons wanting interest. As Your Excellency knows, it is our custom to reverence the laws and customs of the religion of Islam in your country, nor does the Agency allow anything to be done contrary to that religion. For instance, as Your Excellency is aware, we do all we can to help in preventing the importation of forbidden things; I myself confiscated large &lt;}jiantitieB of opium for that reason not long ago. I write now to inform Your Excellency tnat you need have no fear that any of the principles of the religion of Islam will be broken through the establishment of the Bank, as the said Bank is willing to give a strong assurance both to Your Excellency and the Agency that they will conduct their business on principles in accordance with the precepts and practice of the religion of Islam and that they will abide by the laws and usages of the local courts of Baiirain, that is to say the Shara* courts of Islam and the customary court. The advantages which the establishment of a Bank confers oil a centre of trade are many and well-known, but I should like to remind Your Excellency of the following main consider ations ; - Firstly. That money can be sent without trouble or diffi culty all over the world. Secondly. That cash, valuables or important documents can be deposited in safety. Thirdly. That assistance can be given to merchants in effecting r |1 i r- n ✓ Jr 'Ieffecting purchases and making shipments of goods, and this help would be particularly valuable in times of scarcity or bad seasonswhen much distress might be avoided by this means. Fourthly. That transactions connected with the pearling trade, on which the prosperity of Bahrain so largely depends, will be made easier. Fifthly. That insurance can be effected with ease. Sixthly. That by the use of cheques drawn on money deposited with the Bank: payments can be made much quicker and * more easily than if made by actually handing over cash. Another side of the question to which I should like to draw Your Excellency's attention is this. Any improvement in the commercial facilities which are available in a place is certain to produce an increase in the trade of that place, md in conse^ience an increase in the Customs receipts. Thus the establishment of a Bank would indirectly benefit the revenue of Your Excellency's Government. In view of the willingness of the Bank to offer a strong assurance which will effectively safeguard the business princi ples of the religion of Islam and in consideration of the advantages to the trade and commerce of Your Excellency's dominions which will be gained by their establishment, I hope Your Excellency will now be able to give them your approval in this matter. s11; The following; evidence points to the fact of Yousuf Kanoo having used his influence to prevent the establishment of a Bank• * ./hen speaking to L'r Eavphail he was evidently much concerned as to ho'7 much the Bank intended to help the small men. ( $ He himself ,1 understand, receives large urns as deposits from such people as Shaikh 'Abdullah Dawasiri during the non-pearlciealing season, so does not want any competition. ft I'.ivza Abdul Husain (Interpreter) told me that from what passed at Mr I..acphail 1 s interview with Y.K. latter was against Bank. Shaikh 'Abdul Latif Dawasiri spontaneously informed me that 'a friend of the Government' was inciting people against the Bank , but he would not definitely mention a name, 'hom he inefl^yt was obvious. On Feb.36th I mentioned to Shaikh 'Isa that one or two people were endeavouring from interested motives to obstruct the establishment of the Bank. He aaid he had heard so, but that he understood that within four years. the merchants would ali go. bankrupt a.s the Bank was like a great mountain upon which anyone who fell would be broken. At this point the Interpreter told me this wJas exactly the metaphop he had heard had been used by Y.K. ,so I said to Shaikh 'Isa r ' that is just what was ro orted to me as what' one of the obstructors had given out' upon which the Shaikh laughed long and loud.He said he personally had no objection to the Bank -it was a commercial matter not a political so he must assemble the merchants and ask their opinion. 1 Abd-al-'Aziz al Qasaibi ,Bin Sa'ud's agent, came to see me and mentioned the Bank of his own accord, I said I understood certain interested people were speaking against it,and he smild and said that was so. It is imnpssible to put on paper the whole evidence which mostly depended on 'atmosphere' ; but the cumulative effect of it was to make me send for Y.'. I told him that I had a dificult matter to speak to him about and that he must pardon absolute frankness. That from three separate sources 1 had heard that he had be^n sx^eaking . against the Bank. I told him a.bout the mountain remark of the Shaikh's, ite made the usur.l remarks about being the. Xriond of the'Governinent etc.) 1 put the matter in the form tfurt I could no^: believe such a thing of a man 'ith hjfes record, but thought it best to be frank.

I have th® honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's letter of the 2Srd Rabi f -al-Thani, 1335,= 16th February 19 17, in which Your Excellency stated that you were « unable to allow the opening of a Branch of the Eastern Bank in Bahrain as the transactions of a bank are carried out on a system of interest which is unlawful according to Islamic law and that the local courts are Shara* and Customary which do not decree in favour of persons wanting interest. As Your Excellency knows, it is our custom to reverence the laws and customs of the religion of Islam in your country, nor does the Agency allow anything to be done contrary to that religion. For instance, as Your Excellency is aware, we do all we can to help in oreventing the importation of forbidden things; I myself confiscated large quantities of opium for that reason not long ago. I write now to inform Your Excellency tnat you need have no fear that any of the principles of the religion of Islam will be broken through the establishment of the Bank, as the said Bank is willing to give a strong assurance both to Your Excellency and the Agency that they will conduct their business on principles in accordance with the precepts and practice of the religion of Islam and that they will abide by the laws and usages of the local courts of Bahrain, that is to say the Shara courts of Islam and the customary court. The advantages which the establishment of a Bank confers oil a centre of trade are many and well-known, but I should like to remind Your Excellency of the following main consider ations:- Firstly. That money can be sent without trouble or diffi culty all over the world. i Secondly. That cash, valuables or important documents can be deposited in safety. Thirdly. That assistance can be given to merchants in effectingeffecting purchasee and making Bhipmente of goods^ and this help would be particularly valuable in times of scarcity or bad seasons'when much distress might be avoided by this means. Fourthly. That transactions connected with the pearling trade, on which the prosperity of Bahrain so largely depends, will be made easier. Fifthly. That insurance can be effected with ease. Sixthly. That by the use of cheques drawn on money deposited with the Bank payments can be made much quicker and more easily than if made by actually handing over cash. Another side of the question to which I should like to draw Your Excellency's attention is this. Any improvement in the commercial facilities which are available in a place is certain to produce an increase in the trade of that place, and in consecpence an increase in the Customs receipts. Thus the establishment of a Bank would indirectly benefit the revenue of Your Excellency's Government. In view of the willingness of the Bank to offer a strong assurance which will effectively safeguard the business princi pies of the religion of Islam and in consideration of the advantages to the trade and commerce of Your Excellency's dominions which will be gained by their establishment, I hope Your Excellency will now be able to give them your approval in this matter. / . 1 VI —.

The Political Agency, Bahrein. Dated 5th May t 1929. To The Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum. I have been informed by the Adviser to the Bahrein Government that a consignment of twenty lakhs of rupees in silver is at present in the customs consigned to Mr Yusuf ( marked Ottoman Bank ) Kanoo, and that he believes that it is his intention to open a branch for the Ottoman Bank here. The Adviser is stotrngly opposed to the opening of a branch of another bank here, as he is of the opinion jpt that there is not enough business for two banks, and that if the Eastern Bank found much business cut away from them they might reduce the sa^cle of their operations and post or close down a native manager here, leaving Bahrein to an even greater e extent in the power of the Xanoo interests. I am unable to find the papers dealing with the institution of the branch of the Eastern Bank, but I have seen from another file that Yusuf Kanoo has been credited' by been violently opposed to allow ing them to come here, and also with having instigated Shaikh Isa to forbid it. The Adviser informs me that the Eastern Bank were only allowed to come hnre on the express understanding that they would not lend money at interest, whereas a represen- tatlve of the Ottoman Bank who visited Bahrein promised that they would allow 10 /(on current accounts,in conversa- tion with Arab merchant si &gt;0 far the Shaikh does not appear to have any very marked views on the subject, but does not appear to bein favour of a second banJc opening in Bahrein. I personally think that it would not be fair to allow the Ottoman Bank to cut in at this point# for I am told that last year was the first jceaa? that the Eastern Ban have shown a profit, and it appears from remarks that I have seen scattered in files that thsy were pressed to come c&gt; here by us in the first place. Indeed when it is consid^er L a that dealing as they do in rupees they can make little by that exchangji and by their concession they are precluded from ^ can be lending money at interest there but little meat on their A Bahrein bone. It would also ^be not in the best interests of Bahrein to allow an increase of Kanoo influence# if it can be avoided# but I should be glad if before I express a final opinion you would give me some references from your records to. correspondence about the Eastern Bank so that I may examine more lully the circumstances under which it was encouraged to open a branch here. io Political AgBnt, Bahrein.Conf identia l. . no, 201-a. or 1929.

A list of references to correspondence re garding the institution of a branch of the iGAstern Bank at Bahrain is enclosed herewith. 1 am advised that in Persia the Ottoman .Bank enjoys combined Jfrench and British diplomatic protection. In places where there is a French consul, it is'he that • * moves in support of the Bank's interests. in other places, the British consul uses his influence in / support of the Bank, but in such a way that no harm is done to the interests of any competing British bank. On the analogy of the Persian practice, i con sider that no support should be given to the Ottoman Bank which, by opening a branch at Bahrain, would com pete with the Eastern Bank, which is a wholly British concern. i consider that there is no room for two banK;a in Bahrain, and that^ if the Ottoman Bank started competition, the Eastern Bank would probably have to close its doors. fReferenceB regarding the Kastern 13ank, Jialirain. 1.

The main correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain (chiefly Captain Percy Gordon Loch, who occupied the position from November 1916 to February 1918, and George Alexander Gavin Mungavin, March to December 1918) and the Bahrain merchant Yusuf Kanoo [Yūsuf bin Aḥmad Kanoo].In July 1916 the Political Resident Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Zachariah Cox forwarded a request to the Foreign Department of the Government of India, made to him by the Eastern Bank at Basra, to open a bank in Bahrain (folio 2). The request was granted by Government, opening the way for consent to be obtained from the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah. Shaikh ‘Īsá, along with numerous local merchants, was resistant to the idea of a bank in Bahrain, objecting in particular to the fact that interest accumulated on deposits would be unlawful according to Islamic (Sharī‘a) law (folios 7, 8). In response, representatives of the Eastern Bank gave written assurance that any branch of the Eastern Bank established in Bahrain would conduct their business according to Islamic principles (folios 13, 14). Resistance from local merchants, and in particular form the influential and powerful money lender Yūsuf Kanoo, continued to hamper efforts to win Shaikh ‘Īsá’s consent and establish the bank (folios 19-21, 28, 30). Renewed efforts to gain support for the establishment of a bank in 1918, in particular a series of interviews between influential merchants and Mungavin, were more successful, leading to Shaikh ‘Īsá finally giving permission for the bank to be set up (folio 41). However, socio-economic circumstances in the Gulf – chiefly a shortage of capital and manpower as a result of the War – meant that the opening of the bank was further delayed until 1920.In May 1921 the Advisor to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalyrmple-Belgrave, reported to the Political Agent that there were twenty lakhs (100,000) of rupees in silver in the Bahrain customs, consigned to Yūsuf Kanoo, who was understood to be establishing a branch of the Ottoman Bank in Bahrain. The Political Agent wrote to the Residency, stating that Belgrave was against the establishment of a branch of the Ottoman Bank in Bahrain, the main reason being that there was insufficient business on the island to support two banks (folios 78-79). The Political Agent (now Captain Charles Geoffrey Prior) also reported that the Ottoman Bank would pay interest on deposits, leading to enquiries by Eastern Bank representatives to ascertain the extent to which the Eastern Bank was bound by its promise to adhere to Islamic practice.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern Bank Limited</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Islamic law</topic></subject><subject><topic>Banking</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002f1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
