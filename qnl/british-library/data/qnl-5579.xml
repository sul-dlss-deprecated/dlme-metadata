Ihe history of Koweit up to 1907 is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908. At the time when that memorandum was composed and until the beginning of the War, Koweit was of vital interest to Great Britain in connection with the Baghdad Railway, and during the periodjg^ 1908-14 Mis Majesty’s Government, in their relations with the Sheikh, had primarily in view the consolidation of their position and influence in Koweit in the lace of the efforts of Germany to establish herself at the head of the Gulf. 8. -The vexed question of the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit over the islands of Bubiyan and Warba, dealt with in the Foreign Office Memorandum, was carefully investigated by the local authorities and the Government of India in 1907-9. The conclusions which emerged were that enquiry had gone far to establish the claims of the Sheikh to the ownership of Bubiyan, but that no satisfactory evidence had been produced as to his claims to M arba ; and in the circumstances His Majesty’s Government decided that it was inadvisable to raise any question of the rights of the Sheikh to either island. (Both islands were recognised as falling within the dominions of the Sheikh of Koweit by the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913.) 9. Between 1909 and 1911 the attitude of the Turkish authorities in the Basra \ ilayet, who placed difficulties in the way of the registration of property acquired in their jurisdiction by the Sheikh unless His Excellency would consent to describe himself as a Turkish subject—an attitude which inevitably raised the wider question of the status of Koweit, gave rise to considerable correspondence, in the course of which His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make clear the views on that matter of His Majesty’s Government. Circumstances, however, intervened to make an immediate demarche by Sir G. Lowther from time to time unnecessary or undesirable, and the question merged in the General Anglo-Turkish negotiations initiated in 1911. 10. Ihe Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government, and ga5 e a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. Subsequent developments as regards oil concessions are dealt with in para. 29 below. With the assistance ol a loan of &lt;£12,500 from the Government of India, arrangements were made in 1914 for the installation by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on behalf of the Sheikh, of a water distilling plant, which was not however brought into operation until 1919.* rv question of Koweit played an important part in the \nol 0 - lurkish negotiations of 1911-14. An agreement was reached, and a Convention, to give effect to it, signed on 29th July 1913. Under this agreement, in the terms of which the concurrence of the Sheikh had been secured, the territory of Koweit was recognised as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire ; the Ottoman flag was to be flown by the Sheikh but he was to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the corner - he was to continue to be a Turkish Kaimakam, and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government; the full administrative autonomy of the Sheikh was recognised within the territories of Koweit proper, the limits of which were defined by the red circle on Map No. II appended to this Memorandum ; within a surroundino- area (included within a green line on the map) which was occupied by tribes Government, and His Majesty’s Government engaged that so lono- as no change was made in the status quo as now defined, they would not alter thenature of British relations with the Government of Koweit or establish a Protectorate there. A subsidiary article (9) secured to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra Vilayet. 12. The outbreak of war in August 1914 prevented the final ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the substance of which is summarised above, and the entry of Turkey into the War in November 1914 against the Allies produced a completely new situation. The Sheikh, wdio had been informed officially on 8th August 1914 of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, on 21st August made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty’s Government on behalf of himself and his tribes, 1 ''' placed “his elloi’ts, his men, and his ships ” at the disposal of Great Britain, and expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrison from ,the islands at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, which he claimed to be lawfully his. In return for his co-operation against the Turks the Sheikh, in a letter from the Political Resident in the Gulf, dated 3rd November Ibid,! was given the following assurances, of which the third is the most important:— (1) The date gardens which you now possess between Fao and Gurnah shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and be immune from taxation. (2) You are guaranteed by the Great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr and Bubiyan. (3) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. 13. In February 1915 sanction was given to the transfer to Koweit of the Admiralty coaling depot at BusliireJ a step originally recommended by the Government of India in 1910, and approved in 1912 by the Foreign Office, Admiralty and India Office, the taking of which had however hitherto been postponed in view of the possibility that it might prejudicially react on the Anglo-Turkish negotiations. But on the recommendations of the Naval authorities it was agreed in 191(3 that the proposal should be dropped until the conclusion of the War. It was decided in 1920 that the transfer should not take place. 14. It had been agreed in 1913 that an Indian Post Office should be established at Koweit on the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention; and an office w r as in fact opened under the orders of the Government of India at the beginning of 1915. 15. Sheikh Mubarak (K.C.I.E. 1911, K.C.S.I. 1914\ who had ruled Koweit since his assassination of his brother in 1896, and wdio had consistently co-operated actively with His Majesty’s Government, died on 28th November 1915, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, who w T as informed in March 1916 by the Viceroy that “ so long as you act up to existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” 16. In the earlier part of 1915 Koweit had been brought in intimate contact with the affairs of Ibn Sand on the revolt of the Ajman tribe against the latter. The Ajman were finally routed in September, and forced to take refuge in Koweit territory, in which they remained until the death of Mubarak, immediately on which Ibn Sand pressed his successor, Sheikh Jabir, to expel the Ajman Sheikhs, a demand to which Jabir, reluctant to eject the Ajman lest they should be driven into the enemy camp, but unable to hold out against Ibn Sand’s pressure without creating an open breach, finally yielded in February 1916. 17. Relations between Ibn Sand and Koweit had for some years before the death of Mubarak been growing cooler. Ibn Sand had latterly resented what he regarded as the equivocal attitude of the Sheikh during the negotiations between the Ottoman Government and himself in the spring of 1914; the asylum given to the Ajtnan was a further grievance,§ ancMhe incidence of the transit dues levied from time immemorial in Koweit, formed the subject of a complaint by the ruler of Nejd in 1916.

Darbar held at Koweit on 20th November 1910, and attended by Ibn Sand, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sheikh Jabir of Koweit and Sir Percy Cox, for the purpose of investing the Sheikh of Koweit with the C.S.I., the three chiefs swore together to work with His Majesty’s Government for the achievement of a common end.^J IS. On the death on 5th February 1917, of Sheikh Jabir “in whose weak hands ’ to quote the Political Agent, 0 Government in Koweit “ had ^ almost collapsed,” His Majesty’s Government approved the recognition as successor of his brother Sheikh Salim, to whom an assurance similar to that granted to his predecessor and quoted above was conveyed by the Viceroy in March 1917. r l he new Sheikh was a man of very different calibre from Sheikh Jabir. Narrow in outlook, bigoted in religious matters, tactless in his personal relations, his marked individuality and strength of purpose none the less made it possible for the Political Agent to report in the spring of 1918 that he had “established himself in a brief space of time very securely in the Sheikhdom.” But the qualities which helped him to assert himself locally shortly set him at odds with both His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand. 19. Difficulty arose with the latter over the Ajrnan tribe, whom Salim allowed in October 1917 to return to Koweit, and over the respective Tel. from sir p.cox to fights of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh to levy tribute on the Awazim tribe, Dec ‘ 2 ° aud for _ med the subject of vigorous complaint by Ibn Saud at the end of 1917. In July 1918, Mr. Philby represented that Ajman activities based on Koweit territory were causing widespread resentment in Nejd and leading to remonstrance from Ibn Saud as to the inadequacy of p. 4130/18. our support. Measures to meet this grievance—the location of a lnobile column in Koweit territory, the stationing of a British post 1918, p. 4193 / 18 . 1 Safwan V eils, the occupation of Koweit itself—were under exami nation when, in September 1918, Lord Allenby’s victories in Palestine made^ the removal of the blockade possible and temporarily eased the situation, and no action was taken beyond warning the leading Sheiks that if raids continued their subsidies would cease. t Tel. from C.C.

Difficulty with His Majesty’s Government arose over the strict main tenance in Koweit territories and ports of the blockade imposed in (?) 1915|| with a view to preventing the leakage of supplies to the enemy, whether in Mesopotamia or in the isolated Turkish garrisons at Medina and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula—a blockade, not unnaturally unpopular with .Koweit merchants, the strictness of which was relaxed by Salim. The Sheikh subsequently adopted an attitude so obstructive in the matter that, after prolonged consideration, it was found necessary to warn him through tlie I olitical Resident, on 5th duly 1918, that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts “contrary to the interests of (His Majesty’s) Government’’ unf 01 tuiiatelv be committed in future, he would be held personally responsible.'f The hint was not wasted ; the Sheikh for the remainder of the war maintained a less unsatisfactory attitude towards His Majesty’s Government,J and his co-operation in the matter of the blockade was recognised at the end of 191.8 by the grant of the C.S.I. and of a lump sum ol ') lakhs of inpees, and by the cancellation of the claim of the Government of India in respect of the loan of £12,500 made in connection with the Koweit water supply in 1914§ (see para. 10 above). -.1. On the conclusion of the war His Lxcellency despatched his nephew, the present Sheikh, to offer his congratulations to the King on its successful outcome, and there has been no friction of importance since then with His Majesty’s Government. (2).—1919-28. 2_k I he termination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Koweit, which Ilis Majesty’s Government had promised in November 1914 to recognise as an independent principality under British protection. '1 he declaration of a British protectorate over the State, as over Bahrein &amp;c., which was mooted by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, met with no support from the Government of India, who took exception to it || It has not been possible to ascertain the px-ecise date.as likely to rouse suspicion in the neighbouring Arab peoples, to provoke the jealousy of other Powers, and to involve His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in heavy obligations, both military and financial. Their view was accepted by the Secretary of State for India; the proposal was dropped and matters continued to rest on the declaration of 1914 quoted in para. 12 above. On the general question of status ^sbeing specifically raised in connection with the preparation of a Koweit Order in Council, the Foreign Office in July 1921 expressed the view that, from the legal standpoint and on the understanding that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, “the status of this territory would appear to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres.” It was subsequently agreed that a final decision on the question of status must await the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and, the Treaty of Lausanne having been signed in the autumn of 1923, steps were taken to introduce an Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the territory of the Sheikh. That territory, as stated in para. 2 above, may now be regarded as an independent Arab State under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 23. The questions of most importance which have arisen in Koweit since the conclusion of the War are the following:— A. Internal:— (1) Koweit Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the Principality. (2) Termination of the lease of Bunder Shweikh. B. External:— (1) Relations with Ibn Sau&lt;J — (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq boundary question ; (fe) Koweit-Nejd Customs question ; (c) The Akhwan menace. (2) Relations with Iraq — (a) Exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit; (b) Position of Koweit vis-a-vis Iraq. (3) Relations with Persia. Intehnal Questions, 1919-28. (a) The Koweit Order in Council. 24. The question of extending the scope of the “Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,” had been under consideration before the War, but no decision had been reached upon it, the difficulty in respect of Koweit having principally been the undesirability of taking action before a settlement should have been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab Littoral. In December 1919 the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad again raised' ::: ' the question of passing a jurisdictional Order in Council for Koweit. The India Office expressed the opinion, however,| that, although the Order was desirable in itself and though there would be advantage in issuing it at an early date, it was desirable to postpone action until a decision had been taken on the machinery for the administration of the Mesopotamian Mandate and the effect of the Mandate upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with contiguous countries. This view was accepted by the Foreign Officef and the matter was allowed to rest for a year. 25. The question was again raised in the summer of 1921 by the High Commissioner in Iraq, who recommended (a view in which the Government of India concurred)^ that the promulgation of an Order in Council need not be further delayed now that Turkey was recognised as having lost suzerainty over the Principality. The matter was referred to the Colonial Office who, under the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, had become responsible for policy on the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf. On reference to the foreign Office they were informed that, from the legal point of view and on the supposition that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, the status of that territory would seem to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres under which Letter from F.O. to I.O., July 25 1921, P. 3495. * Letter from C.C. to G. of I., Dec. 22, 1919, P.697/20, t 1.0. letter to F.O., June 8 1920, P. 3733,20.

No further action was taken until the Treaty of Lausanne had been signed and, owing to the necessity for departmental examination of the provisions of the Order, the approval of His Majesty to an Order in Council was not finally obtained until 1.7th March 1925. Under the Order in question jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons, the subjects and protected persons of non-Moslem foreign Governments, and Koweit subjects or the subjects of other Moslem Governments registered in the Office of the Political Agent as being regularly employed by British subjects or subjects of non-Moslem foreign Governments, was vested in the Political Agent subject to the general control of, and a right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It may be noted' ::: ' that, no' foreign Power having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its nationals in Koweit by His Majesty, the Political Agent was instructed, at the request of the Foreign Office, that, in the event of a national of a non- Moslem Power committing some crime or misdemeanour necessitating proceedings against him, or of such a person becoming involved in civil proceedings, the matter should at once be brought to the notice of Ilis Majesty’s Government who, on learning that such a case had arisen, would take steps to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desired that the case should be dealt with under the Koweit Order in Council. The Order in Council came into force in the 1st October 1925,j* but the concurrence of the Sheikh in the delegation of jurisdiction over the classes of person in question was not finally obtained until November 1925.J Since that date various Rules of Court and King’s Regulations have been issued under the Koweit Order in Council, but no point of importance has arisen in connection with its operation. 27. It may be recorded that, a clearer understanding as to responsibility, as between the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, for the internal administration of Koweit having been reached by that stage, the preparation and issue of the Order in Council of 1925 were, by agreement with the Colonial Olhce, left to be dealt with by the India Office in conjunction with the Foreign Office. (b) The Bunder Shweikh Lease. 28. The question of terminating the lease of Bunder Shweikh, the earlier history of which is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and the engagements entered into in connection with which by His Majestv’s Government are shown in the Precis of Treaties appended to the present Memorandum, came up for consideration on the conclusion of the War. After considerable correspondence during 1919-20, the Government of India recommended in April 1920 that the lease should be terminated as the Sheikh had maintained a consistently obstructive attitude towards His Majestv’s Government. Uncertainty as to the status of Koweit under the Peace Treaty, and consideration of the political effect on the Sheikh of withdrawal of the subsidv which the rent of Bunder Shweikh in fact constituted, of the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on Ilis Excellency in other wavs, and of the question of retaining the site at a reduced rent, &amp;c., prevented a decision before the death of Sheikh Salim in February 1921. His Majesty’s Government subsequently decided in consultation with the Government of India to terminate the lease of the Bunder Shweikh lands, while agreeing7 s ancF reaty ; :h the- would Order ti that )reion^ orised 3asure &gt;t, the mi^ht &gt; force :as they had no present use for the wireless buildings erected on those lands, Deep, from h.c., Iraq, to to the use of the buildings in question by the Sheikh of Koweit as a n 34 ^/ 2 / 2 1922 ‘ quarantine station for the town. The High Commissioner for Iraq reported in August 1922 that this decision had been communicated to and accepted by the Sheikh. There have been no further echoes of this question since that date. It should be noted, however, that while the lease has been ^ terminated, the Agreement does not appear to have been abrogated, and that the reciprocal pledges exchanged on its conclusion in 1907 presumably, therefore, remain binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments.

In concluding the review of the more important post-war internal developments -in Koweit, reference may conveniently be made to the •question of oil. The Sheikh had agreed in 1913 (see para. 10 above) not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Here, as in Bahrein, the question of obtaining a concession w r as revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1921, and His Majesty’s Government, who were anxious to facilitate the establishment by the Company of control over the oil resources of the north Arabian coast, agreed to the institution of negotiations, which were conducted through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Lengthy negotiations have, however, so far proved unfruitful. (The general question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the Board of Trade Memorandum on page JJ5-) External Questions, 1919-28. (1) Relations with Ibn Saud. (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq Boundary Question. 30. Owing to the non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, the boundaries of Koweit had, as explained above, been left in suspense on the outbreak of the War. Clause 6 of the Treaty concluded with Ibn Saud on the 20th December 1915, provided that the limits of Koweit territory should thereafter be determined. The question remained in a fluid state until the end of the War. 51. In January 1919, on Sheikh Salim proposing to build a fort at Major More’s Memo. Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manila, Ibn Saud took exception, claiming R 241 7/28. that the site in question lay within his territory. No overt act followed, but relations on this subject became increasingly strained, customs difficulties— the Sheikh having placed an embargo on exports to Ibn Sand’s worts** * Letter from ri,,, bility, ar the ;e, the ement ce in further aggravating the situation. Matters culminated in the surprise and June21 1920, defeat by Akhwan under Faisal-al-Dawish of the Koweit tribesmen, under ‘ ' Sheikh Dhaij, who had been sent by Sheikh Salim to contest Akhwan occupancy of Jariyah, at Hamdeh, near Janyah, on the 18th April 1920, from p. () 3 i 7 / 2 o. which point the friction between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud became acute. Ihe situation was briefly,j' that the Sheikh claimed on his southern t Cp. tel. from c.c., frontier the boundaries represented by the green line in the map attached to 1920 f ° 1 ' L ’ draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which represented the area administered by P- 6281 / 20 . larlier &gt;, and jesty’s resent W ar.

Ibn Saud, on the other hand, •claimed the southern portion of the area in question by virtue of the fact that the tubes ordinarily resident therein had since 1914 or thereabouts, been under his direct control, and not under that of Sheikh Salim or his predecessor, Sheikh Jabir. 32. During the summer of 1920, His Majesty’s Government, with a view to determining the dispute, on which they had been approached by both : Tel. from p.a., K.nveit, paities^, authorised Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, to t0 H G ’ Ira( i-An#. 15 discuss the matter with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit.

Sheikh Salim, on the other hand, claimed to take advantage of the frontier agreed upon between Turkey and His Majesty’s Government, as embodied in the draft Auglo-Turkish Convention. Sir P. Cox, having heard both sides and formed his own conclusions, recommended that a meeting should be arranged during the winter of 1920 between the principals with a view to settlement. At this stage Sheikh Salim (who, like Ibn Sand, had given an undertaking in writing to refrain from aggression pending tbe^ settlement of the issues by the mediation of His Majesty’s Government), having failed to demobilise a considerable force which he had gathered together at Jahra, at the head of Koweit Bay, was attacked by the Akhwan and an inconclusive if bloody fight ensued (October 1920). 33. Thanks to the good offices of the High Commissioner, it proved possible to avoid further hostilities, and negotiations continued until the early part of 1921. In December 1920 Ibn Sand, who in November| had been invited to visit Basra with a view to reaching a settlement under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, expressed his willing ness to accept the ex parte decision of the High Commissioner, but stated that he was unable to go to Basra owing partly to ill-health, and partly to internal political difficulties. In January 1921, no settlement having yet been reached, the Sheikh of Mohammerah offered to send his son Sheikh Chasib, accompanied by Sheikh Ahmed el Jabir, nephew and heir presumptive of the Sheikh of Koweit, to Nejd^f to endeavour to arrange a truce between ibn Sand and Sheikh Salim. His offer was accepted and the mission left for Bahrein en route for Nejd in February, reaching Ibn Sand’s camp to the north of Riyadh on the 2nd March. On the 4th March the news of the death of Sheikh Salim arrived, whereupon Ibn Sand stated that there was no longer any quarrel to settle or any need for a frontier between his territories and those of the Sheikh of Koweit'*'—an arrangement with which Sheikh Ahmed (whose succession was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, who renewed to him the assurances given to Sheikh Salimf), was reported at the time to be quite satisfied. (Ibn Sand had already been informed^ before the death of Sheikh Salim, that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territory within the inner boundary (the red circle) shown on the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement as definitely appertaining to Koweit and not open to dispute). 34. No further developments took place until November 1922, when at the Confeience held at v)jair from 2^th November to 3rd December between Sir I ercy Cox and Ibn Saud (the Political Agent, Koweit, also being present) the Koweit-Nejd frontier came up for consideration. It was recognised at once that the power of the Sheikh of Koweit in the desert was much less than it had been at the time of the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, and a settlement was finally reached under which the frontier as between Nejd and Koweit starts from the junction of the Wadi al Anjah with the Batin on the west; running thence (leaving Riqai to Nejd' in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the led semicucle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish agreement, and reproduced in Map II appended to this Memorandum ; thence following the red semicircle to the sea south of Ras al Qulaiah. The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Koweit was defined as above. It was simultaneously agreed that the tract of country bounded on the north b\ the above line, on the west by the Shnqq, on the east bv the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastward from the Shaqq in the west through Ain al Abd to the sea north of Ras al Mishab, should be recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Koweit, who were to enjoy equal rights in it until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government. This frontier, which had been negotiated on behalf of the Sheikh (Majoi Aloie, the 1 olitical Agent at Koweit, representing his interests), was accepted by His Excellency on the 20th January 1923. ' 35. In April 1923 the Sheikh was informed that His Majesty’s Government recognised the frontier claimed by him as between Koweit and Iraq and the attribution to Koweit of the Islands of Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan Failakah9 Auhab, Kubbar, Qaru, and Uium-ei-Maradin—in other words, the frontier indicated by the green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913. The frontiers of Koweit are accordingly as shown on Map II attached to the present Memorandum. Since 1923 no difficulty has arisen in regard to them. A (6) Customs dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. 30. The difficulty is not a new one; it dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913, Nejd acquired a sea front, but the sea front in question contained no port of any real value, and the P. 1276 / 24 . efforts made from time to time by Ibn Saud, with the assistance at intervals of His Majesty’s Government, to secure that steamship lines such as the British Indian Steam Navigation Company should call at Ojair or at Qatif, or to develop Ojair, Qatif or Jubail, have proved abortive. In these circumstances a friendly understanding with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit on the question of customs and transit dues is of great and evident importance to the Ruler of Nejd. Agreement with Bahrein, on the basis of a transit duty of 2 per cent., was reached in 1920, after long discussion and much ill-feeling, with the assistance of the Government of India. Agieement with Koweit, which 111 1923 levied a 4 per cent, duty on imports and a further 4 pei cent, tiansit duty, has not yet been reached j and since 2999 / 2 ;!. 19l 0 Ibn Saud has 111 consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Koweit with the result that the prosperity of the Principality, as indeed of Qasim and Hail in Nejd, has been seriously affected. . 3/. Ihe position is briefly that Ibn Saud, on the ground that it is impossible to collect import duty on the desert frontier between Kuwait and Nejd, is anxious for the establishment either of a Nejdi Custom House in Koweit town, or of an arrangement under which export duty only should be collected ou his behalf at Koweit a fixed sum being paid to Nejd instead of . «,*„■ More-, m.™. import duty. A third proposal,'' made 111 1923 by the Sheikh’s cousin 8 - v - Abduiiat-as-Saiim. Abdullah-as-Salim, was that the embargo should be raised on terms which would have involved the payment to Ibn Saud, through an Agent and C ollector stationed in Koweit (Abdultah-as-Salim himself), of the whole of the customs dues on goods exported from Koweit by land other than those , Tnnp , I()2S destined for the Sheikh’s own subjects or for Iraq.f p. 3476/23 38. Ihe objection of the Sheikh of Koweit to an agreement on the lines referred to above would appear to be due as much to the fear of allowing 1 m baud to establish a stranglehold over Koweit as to anxiety to secure an arrangement which shall not be economically unsatisfactory from his own point of view. An arrangement which would enable Ibn Saud to collect his own dues m Koweit would, as the Government of India pointed out in December 1923, appear prund facie to contravene both Ibn Sand’s engagements to His Majesty’s Government, and those into which His Majesty’s Government have themselves entered with Koweit; while the extension in Koweit of the influence of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd would in any event be objectionable—the engagements to Koweit of His Majesty’s Government apart on general political grounds. o9. There has been no development of importance in recent vears, though the position cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of either Koweit or Aejd. A settlement which would be fair to both parties and unobjectionable irom the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government could best be reached on the lines suggested in July 1923 by the then Political Resident in the 1 erstan GuR, which were accepted at the time by the Colonial Office and the India Office. Colonel Knox’s recommendation was that steps should be taken to obtain the agreement of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, firstly to the appointment of a Customs expert, preferably from India, to advise on le le 01 m o le oveit Customs, and on the shares of the Customs revenue to be apportioned to Nejd and Koweit respectivelv, and, secondly, to the appointment for five years of an official to serve under tl.e control of the lolitica!

Sheikh Ahmed evinced the least desire to have the dispute settled ; ” neither party raised the question at the Kovveit conference in the same year; and though in October 192(3 the Sheikh of Koweit was stated by the Political Agent, Koweit, to be thinking of paying Ibn Sand a visit, the real object of which would be to induce him to remove the trade prohibitions, and though in February 1928 the Political Resident reported that the effect of the embargo was to create stagnation in Koweit trade, the commercial prosperity of Koweit depending on Nejd, there has been no development in the matter since that date. (c) The Akhwan Menace. 40. Akhwan raids on Kovveit had taken place in 1924 and 1925,J but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the Principality.§ At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Piqai on 27th January 1928, | and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again successfully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Govern ment under existing engagements for the “ protection of Koweit ” (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument^), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive, cp. para. 47 below), was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and l.ewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that His Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars.* 5 * 41. Consequent on the breakdown of the negotiations with Ibn Sand in the summei of l.)_8, and the possible danger of a revival of Akhwan activity on the Iraq-Nejd border, the question of granting discretion to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to carry out reconnaissances by air or car over Koweit territory was raised by the Air Ministry. 42. The “ very obvious and grave political objection ” to air recon naissance over Koweit was emphasised by Sir Gilbert Clayton. After considerable discussion between the Departments concerned, the Air Officer Commanding was finally authorised to carry out occasional reconnaissances both by air and car, at his discretion, on the understanding that the concurrence of the Sheikh should be obtained, through the Political Resident; that reconnaissance should be carried out as Infrequently and m as unprovocative a manner as possible; that the Sheikh should be given “no grounds for supposing that the Royal Air Force have assumed responsibility for the defence of Koweit or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect”; that save in case of real emergency reconnaissance should not be carried out within 25 miles of the Nejd-Koweit frontier nor in the immediate vicinity of the Xejd-lruqfrontier in the neighbourhood of the neutral zone ; and that the authority given should operate only for the period of the present emergency. The question of the establishment ol an advance air base in the event of a raid was reserved for further consideration if and when the need arose. (2) Relations with Iraq. ^ (1) Question of exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit. ^ 4-x As will be seen from para. 12 above, one of the guarantees given on 3rd November 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit was that his “ date gardens on the Pinkish side of the Shatt _ el-Arab should remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation. 5 ’ 44. At the time when the Financial Agreement, arising out of Article 15 of the Anglo-Iraq lieaty of 10th October 1922, was under the consideration of 1 lis Majesty’s Government, it was proposed that a provision to safeguard the light ol the Sheikh under the guarantee referred to above should be inserted. Ibis proposal was subsequently abandoned, and the High Commissioner was instructed in November 1925 to treat this obligation separately under Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Preaty. Owing to an oversight, the point was omitted when the exchange of Notes defining the obligations of Iraq and fiis Majesty s Government under Article 10 of the Treaty took place; and on the matter coming to notice some other method of safeguarding the rights of the Sheikh under the guarantee in question hod to be devised. The Iraq Government, on being approached, expressed the opinion that the immunity in question could not properly be continued in the circumstances without the authoiity of a special law, and that, if special legislation were introduced, it would be rejected by the Iraq Parliament. They stated that they were, in the circumstances, unwilling to take the responsibility of introducing such legislation, and desired that the matter should be referred to His Majesty’s Government. 45. The Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office agreed that there was no ground on which His Majesty’s Government could justify the discontinuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit, as to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. After considerable discussion it was, however, decided that it was undesirable to give prominence to the question by the insertion in the revised Financial Agreement of a provision to cover it if any other method of safeguarding the position be found; and that this might be regarded as having been attained if the Iraq Goveinment accepted the reference in the Memorandum accompanying Article 3 of the revised Ireaty between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq (which provided for the recognition by the Iraq’ Government of British international obligations in respect of Iraq) to the immunity from taxation of the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah as one of the international obligations in question. No objection having been raised to the_ inclusion of the undertaking in question by the Iraq delegates His Majesty s Government in January 1928 placed on record their assumption that the Iraq Government were now prepared to recognise those undertakings as part of the international obligations which His Britannic Majesty had undertaken to see carried out in respect of Iraq, and to recognise that they had inherited the duty of ensuring that those undertakings were fully discharged. the High Commissioner was instructed to inform the Iraq government accordingly, and to endeavour to induce them to agree to continue to afford to the two Sheikhs in question immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens in Iraq. His Majesty’s Government added that, should the Iraq Government, while prepared to honour those under takings, feel doubtful of their ability to persuade the Iraq Parliament to pass the necessary legislation, it would be for consideration whether King beisal should not be requested to pass an Ordinance in accordance with Article 2b (3) of the Iraq Constitution to give effect to them, His Majesty’s Government, taking the view that their fulfilment might be regarded as a treaty o j igation on the part of Iraq which the Government of that country nnght be called upon to fulfil under Article 4 of the Treaty of 10th October 2979c n L/ See P. 4537/27.

Under the engagement of 1914 between Ilis Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, the Principality of Koweit is recognised as an independent Principality and as entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government, by whom, as stated in para. 35 above, the present Koweit-lraq boundary was recognised in 1923. Formally, therefore, there is no question of its absorption by Iraq. The Political Resident in the Persian Gull has, however, recently drawn attention (as the result of an incident in which an Iraq officer was alleged 1o have despatched an Iraq police inspector to Koweit to arrest and bring back an offender from there) to the danger of Koweit and Iraq becoming, in the minds of the native community, unified under British protection. Sir Lionel Haworth remarked 0 that “ it must be an essential part of our policy that Koweit should be kept apart Irom Iraq—it is inevitable that it should be the tendency of Iraq gradually to assimilate Koweit even if there is no conscious knowledge of the iact among the officials of the Iraq Government. Such tendencies result, not from direct action, but from psychological factors, from the dependence of the Sheikh of Koweit upon Iraq for assistance, from the appointment of Iraq officers to Koweit during the raids, and from the common interests of people, alike in race and religion, depending upon the same market centres and in constant daily communication. It is, indeed, perhaps the natural development that Koweit should draw close to Iraq while we are there, but we do not desire her to get so close that, with the development of time, she would be left there when we leave in spite of our wishes . . . It is for us to see . . . that such help as Kowmit may require may be obtained from assistance from our Navy and the training of her people—and it would be better that such training should be given from India and not from Iraq. Koweit should be trained to look to His Majesty’s Government and India alone and not to a country under our Mandate.” 47. I he Political Resident had earlier in 192S urged the undesirability Irom the point ol view' alike of the immediate situation and of our future policy of linking Iraq and Koweit in the mind of Ibn Sand by establishing an air base against Akhwan raiders in Koweit territory. He reiterated his objections in connection with the proposals dealt wdth in paras. 40 and 41 above. On both occasions the Government of India expressed their general agreement in the view taken by him. Lor. i, 146, 1002. Lor. i, 1025. (3) Relations with Persia. 48. No question affecting the relations between Koweit and Persia appears to have arisen in the period now' under consideration, and it would be unnecessary to refer to the relationship between the twm countries were it not for the information which has recently been received that a Persian instruction has been issued to the local Persian officials in the Gulf that the Persian Government can recognise no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Koweit (as from Muscat, Bahrein and the Trueial Sheikhdoms) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports to be issued to them. 49. It is impossible at the present stage to estimate the importance to be attached to the information quoted above. It may, however, be placed on record that no evidence has been traced of effective exercise in the past of Persian authority in Koweit. The twm incidents on which a Persian claim might possibly be based are—first, that Kow'eit was regarded in 1775 as a dependency of Basra, and that a claim might therefore be put forward in view of the fact that Persia had occupied that town from 1775 to 1779 even though Persian authority does not appear in the same period to have extended to Koweit. The second and more important incident is that of 1899. In13 (^rejected by the Shah. October of that year it was ascertained that the Sheikh of Koweit had undoubtedly applied through the Sheikh of Mohammerah to be taken under Persian protection. Mr. Lorimer suggests that this move, which the Sheikh, it is stated, took no pains to conceal, was perhaps contrived by His Excellency merely with a view to testing the degree of interest taken in Koweit by His Majesty’s Government. The Sheikh’s advances were, however, in any case C.—Summary. 50. In conclusion, it may be remarked that, while the present Sheikh is far from an outstanding personality, internal conditions in Koweit at the present time show a marked improvement on the position on the death of Sheikh Salim in 102K In Alienist 1020+ Innal feelintr was VAr»ortorl possibilityJ had not the Sheikh died at a critical period of the Koweit-Nejd + Cp ^ from H c boundary negotiations on 23rd February 1921.

The boundary question has been settled and Abdullah ' as ‘ SaRar- on a basis not unsatisfactory from the point of view of Koweit; the question of British jurisdiction within the Principality has equally been regularised ; internal conditions are not such as to call for serious animadversion and, while the Sheikh, as stated above, is not an outstanding personality, he is not only well disposed towards His Majesty’s Government but, from the point of view of internal administration, may be regarded as a not inefficient ruler Major More’s Report when judged by Arab standards. paslim. 51. On a broad view, the importance of Koweit is less great from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government than that of Bahrein or of Muscat; but its absorption, or the establishment in it of a dominating influence, by Ibn Sand, could not but react injuriously on the position of His Majesty’s Government alike in Iraq and in Bahrein and along the Trucial Coast. Hitherto it has been possible to maintain British influence without substantial interference in the internal affairs of the Principality ; the recent activities of the Akhwan have led to formal appeals by the*Sheikh to the guarantees of protection which he holds from His Majesty’s Government, and it is to be hoped that the standing threat to his independence constituted by his powerful neighbour in Nejd and the effective assistance given him against the Akhwan during the present year may help to continue to keep him generally amenable to British influence. The desirability, at the same time, of securing that the Sheikh shall not escape absorption by Ibn Sand only to end by absorption in an Iraq, no longer under British mandate, and “the increased importance which his Principality, situated at the head of the Gulf, will assume as British control decreases in Iraq, cannot be overlooked in considering the general policy to be adopted in the Principality by His Majesty’s Government. 52. I he points in connection with Koweit which have been specificallv mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- Committee are :— (a) Whether the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs) which is constantly threatened by Ibn Sand, is necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (P.G. 3 viii, P.G. 0 (2) c. i.) (b) The position as between Iraq and Koweit—desirability of keeping Koweit clear from absorption in Iraq, or from coming under Iraq influence. (P.G. G, 2 (b) (3).)

(January 1922), born 1885, has ruled Koweit since March 1921, when his succession to his uncle, Sheikh Salim (born 1864, succeeded 1917, died 23rd February 1921), who had ruled since the death of Sheikh Jabir I bn Mabarak in 1917, was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, subject, it would appear, to agreement to impose and enforce through his territory such further restrictions on the arms c.o. to h.c., Iraq, April 2 traffic as might be considered desirable. On the invitation of His Majesty’s 1921 &gt; R 1758/2L Government, the Sheikh visited the United Kingdom in October 1919, as the representative of his uncle, with the son of Ibn Saud, and was received by the King. His Excellency is entitled to a permanent salute of seven p. 4321/22. guns, the number having been reduced from 12 (personal) on his accession. 2. The principality is an independent Arab State, under British protection, but not a British protectorate.* Its ruler is precluded by his * viceroy’s tei. 1175 s., engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of Treaties 0ct 8 1920 ’ p - 7455 - appended to this Memorandum, from^receiving foreign representatives, and from ceding, leasing, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, or any other purpose, any portion of its territory to any foreigner or foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government; he is bound to suppress slave traffic and to prohibit traffic in arms within his territories ; and he has agreed not to give a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh, assisted in theory by an elected Council of Advisers (two from the Subah or reigning + Tel. from h.c., Iraq, to family, four from the inhabitants, elected for one year), acceptance of p 41921 , which was made for the first time a condition of recognition by the people : Major More . 8 Ueport of Koweit on the accession of the present Sheikh.| The Council, though 1927 , P . 2 (P. 2417 / 28 ).' duly elected, has, however, never met-J 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Agent (at present Major J. C. More, D.S.O.), an appointment created in 1904, maintained since that date save for a brief Lor. n, 1039-40. interval in 1905, and borne on the cadre of the Indian Political Department. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty’s Commission as a Consul or exercise Consular functions. Under the Koweit Order in Council of 1925 (see paras. 24-27 below), he is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the limits of his jurisdiction are the territories and territorial waters of Koweit, and he exercises jurisdiction inter alios over British subjects and protected persons, and over the subjects and protected persons (not being subjects or protected persons of Muslim Governments) of Foreign States in respect of whom the Foreign States concerned may agree to the exercise of such jurisdiction. 5. The effect of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of the internal administration and affairs of Koweit to the Government of India (to whom, and not to His Majesty’s Government, the Political Resident in the Gulf was instructed in 1924 to c/. P.1836/24 and 540 A/ 23 . look for orders regarding them), subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government, and to the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office in matters of political significance. Questions of policy, especially questions m.s. Committee Report, affecting relations with Ibn Saud, fell to be dealt with by the Colonial Office. P ara - 12 - The question of the channels through which the instructions of His Majesty’s Government are to issue on matters affecting the Principality is dealt with in para. 5 of the Note on Political Control in the Persian Gulf on page 6. Expenditure on Koweit is divided between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. In the latest year for which figures are P. 3108 / 28 . available (1926-7) it amounted to Rs. 45,683, plus payments in respect of pension contribution amounting to Rs. 9,423, a total of Rs. 55,106. 2979c 75 10.28(4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fo ' le t ^® t question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu-^ mpnt.fi for and asrainst the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the .of may be a definite object of Ibn Sand’s policy to reduce P OS 1 ^s^s dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asn rom • ^ j in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation ^ think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Sand had such an s aJern realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty s Ho vern ment His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained m article b of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of ,the words therein “ who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty s Govern ment.” On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty Government tolerate dngt correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh o sh ikh might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the bheikli confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. , H u as 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh s visit to Riadh 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud s confidential messengei to Sheikh earlv this year, and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes intoNejd iast February when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi peisonage, ^^i^ t ^^ a minor indication of Ibn Baud’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Minis ry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, becau this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, m reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory w ic had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect: bony you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been P ulsued through An Nafisi.” On another occasion Fuad Bey, m rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government &lt; t dd ^ ow ®^ e personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud p T ew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud fr on J enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are ‘‘Arcades ambo, as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The 'p°i nt of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asirised.” Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— (a) “ You are not really independent, my dear fellow. Y'ou are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, whybe dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? * (&amp;) “ I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein ’ as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ‘ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.’ (c) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. (e) “ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.” 6 . It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud’s parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty’s Government formally assured the Sheikh “of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors8 scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, undei w ic the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agen or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the pieMOUs sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to tn« Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent ot is Majesty’s Government. , , ^ __ £ ,, 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, toi the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was “ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak s arrangements in the mattei ot customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain m the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or expoited by the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. ^ , AT , 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914. in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desk able briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December. 1901) that this “appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan s promise (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words “ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6 . On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘protection’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £ 1 , 000 . and promised him our ‘ good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another'. .... We might, it seems to me, explain ( 1 ) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October, 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted, “but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above). His Majesty’s9 Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.” The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902): “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that (Jfiame.’ This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it “ only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit ” (telegram of the 6 th April, 1911). 8 . The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries.” The phrase “ its boundaries ” is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our obligation extends,” and “ whether they accepted ” general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied : “ We are of opinion that ( 1 ) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory; ( 2 ) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...” 10 . The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8 th April, 1911) :— “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March. 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and. so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6 th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061. of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their ‘ good offices ’ in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term ‘ good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourablv our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...” 11 . The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.” 12 . In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899. with a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently' informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [9823] c ^10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refe only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to anv specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8 th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. ‘ ‘ His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ‘ As regards No. 1 , His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1 st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit ” shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim’s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts “contrary to the interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928, the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit was considered m the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict reading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. The history of the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix C, to the conclusions of which attention is invited. Conclusion. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above, (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (5) secondly, that, subject to this reservation, we are committed to “ good offices ” in respect of “ Koweit,” an assurance which has, since 1911, been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the sheikhdom, but which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; (c) thirdly, that we have promised “ that the town of Koweit and its boundaries ’ ’ belong to the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site was terminated in 1907, the agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that agreement shouldapparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations ^ppf the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); (d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of “British protection” in this connexion; and, while prim a facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11 , 1933. Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by leisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory ; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty's Government under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit'' (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding. Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from the [9823] c 2 *12 Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a permanent base in Koweit territory.' As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances ovey* Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty s Government are anxious, however, that— ( 1 ) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit ‘ ‘ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month. ” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding. Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8 th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: ‘‘Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11 th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8 th May, 1929. quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.( x ) J. G. LAITHWAITE. India Office, February 6 , 1934. (9 [Note. —The paragraph referred to runs as follows: — “The 1914 agreement states that in return for the Sheikh's co-operation against the Turks ‘ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.’ This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word ‘ principality ’ and not ‘ town ’ being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit Sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note, that ‘ on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.’ It is true, as pointed -out in the note, paragraph 16 (d), that neither the present Sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Govern ment’s obligations relieve the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. I he Sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look foi assistance from His IVlajesty s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the Sheikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes, Bewds guns, which wfre mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air Force as machine-gunners.’’]of tue Sneikii in regard to the Koweit oil conceteior indicated the essential weakness \ ^ of our position, he replied that our It difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness In our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements, Had we been able, without violating our pledges to tue United tales Government, to tell the Lhelkh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-*oran oil Company he would have done ao« The meeting then went on to consider relations between I bn baud and Koweit• Slfi ANDBkW RYAN stated that ae had been impressed by the apparent weakness of his gojeety’e Government’s position vie-&amp;-via of Ibn Saud with regard to Koweit, His Majesty's Government were not strongly placed, when it becomebeeaM meoesr ary to warn I bn Smid to keep hia hands off Kowelt, since they were com alt ted to nalntelning that Kowelt was technically an Independent State.

Ibn £nud had oertalnly beun Informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His M^esty’s Oorsmaent. Speaking generally, he added that In fact little tro»dble was likely to be experienced with foreigncj*s In Ko elt, so long ns It regained e Beduln town mled by a Beduia sheikh and not, like Bahrain, a relatlvel cosmopolitan commercial centre.

We might well find many foreign Powers becoming Increasingly interested in Koweit. e could not hare it both ways, and sh aid sooner or later hare to define our position. His M forty’s GoYernment ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely cither towards the greater independence of the Sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. KR.I»» XTitmlfK agreed and atded that, in his view, —-■ - our polled should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declarationof fall control, such *s the establl^hment of a protectorate would he« Such a declaration wight well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrain and of the Crucial Coast and do wore harm than good* • The policy to he followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, os these became necessary, tending to Increase,or at awy rate wot to relax,ear control ower the Siuilkiidoa. R verting to the uestion of Saudi^ KoweitL relations, Sir Andrew R^an drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s doverawent to direct correspondence on business astters between the Sheikh and Ibn Baud* This, no lose than the independence formula, placed us In a eak position in defending Kowelt, and the correspondence in quest*on was or such long standing that it '.as dif ficult now for us to take the line that Tbn Smid should write to as rather than to * het was desirable was that the Sheikh.of his treaty obligations OOXiOHKL FOWLS agresd. Such action would show both the Shsifch and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction* If we did not take some such step as this# we night be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud* We ought# therefore# to write to the Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private correspondence with Ibn Saud had assumed an increasing importance* re should remind him of his treaty obligations in this matter# and tell him that the correapondenoe muat now cease* MR* RKNDKL concurred* A straight forward control of this nature would be easier to maintain and would prevent a repetition of auch incidents as the letter in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty^ GovernmentGovern nt• &lt;af 0) SIR A&gt; RYAN also concurred» and drev attention to the success with which Ihn Baud was spreading the idea that he might naturally adsorb Koweit and was hound to do so sooner or later* He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit* The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud oould most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was pro posed to address to both parties* MR. LAITHWAITB suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose what actionaction could be taken if the United State* Government, in dealing with whom Hie Majesty •• Government had conelatently emphaaiaed the Sheikh 1 * independence, were to produce communicatIona from him regarding the grant of a oonceaaion in the Neutral .&gt;one. It wee, however, agreed that Hi* Majesty 1 * Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh*a treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually It wne agreed that the moat euitable occasion for th* proposed representation* to the Sheikh and T bn sand would be Ibn Sand** letter suggesting term* for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of kowelt and warning the Sheikh against Hi* Majesty 1 * Government. kt the conclusion of the meeting SIN A* Hf aM roised the queetion of th© preaeure which might be exerted anon Ibn send in regardto tho Saadi blockade of Koeeit. This &amp;&amp;d one of two purpose*, either to complete the economic strangulation of kowelt and lead to ite complete absorption In Saudi Arabia, or alee the safeguarding of Saudi economic interest*. Hie itajeaty 9 * Government could not possibly allow the firet of these alternatives• The question therefore wae what real force there wa* in Ibn gaud’s suggestion that his own purely econo-mi© interests required the maintenance of the blockade. CQI0KS1 FOWLS suggested that we might well revert to the sheikh’* proposal that Ibn Sand should have customs posts at a given place;outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with trade. He gave it as hie opinion that even if Ibn Send were to develop Ha* Tanura, a system of manifests for JCowelti-Saudi potieibly with American help, this port wast 2 observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was liie fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, e\en its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura|^k under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What w was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel Fowls concurred generally in Mr. Renders description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit's fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rend el agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant ‘ £ good offices in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “ the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,” and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914. that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards “ good offices” to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Sand. (c) The basis of His Majesty's Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-d-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-d-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [9823] B 2Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.” The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902): “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that ^name.” This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it “ only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit ” (telegram of the 6 th April, 1911). 8 . The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries.” The phrase “ its boundaries ” is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our obligation extends,” and “ whether they accepted ” general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied : “We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory; ( 2 ) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...” 10 . The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8 th April, 1911) :— “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6 th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their ‘ good offices ’ in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term ‘ good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...” 11 . The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.” 12. In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against. [9823] cattack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refeij only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to hav^ given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8 th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. “ His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ‘ As regards No. 1 , His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good' offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1 st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Resident, on the oth July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3 rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts contraiy to the interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict leading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole The history of the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix L, to the conclusions of which attention is invited. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (b) secondly, that, subject to this reservation we are committed to good offices in respect of ‘ ‘ Koweit, ’ ’ an assurance which ^•’i u!i nCe w*’ i ,e t 11 ac&lt; ?®P ted as extending to the whole territory of the sheikhdom but which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; (c) thirdly, that we have promised “that thi town of Koweit aiS its boundaries belong to the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site was terminated in 1907 the agreement i onv was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that agreement shou dapparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations ^of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); {d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of “ British protection ” in this connexion; and, while 'prim^i facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by leisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty s Government under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit'' (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding. Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from the [9823] c 215 obligations to protect the interests of Koweit. The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty’s Government's agreements with the sheikh are three in number : that of January 1899, that of October 1907 and that of November 1914. 8 . The agreement of 1899, as far as “ protection ” is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the sheikh and his successors, merely promised “ the good offices’’ of His Majesty’s Government, “whatever that may mean' as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction of this agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Koweit in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty’s Govern ment that “ the town of Koweit and its boundaries ” belonged to the sheikh of that day and his successors. This agreement in no way added, in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Koweit, though, possibly, read with that of 1899, it might increase these responsibilities up to the “ boundaries.” 10 . The 1914 agreement states that, in return for the sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks, “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agree ments, is a most categorical assurance, and the word “ principality,” and not “ town,” being used would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that “on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.” It is true, as pointed out in the note (paragraph 16 (d)) , that neither the present sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Government’s obligations relieve the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the sheikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air Force as machine gunners. 11 . In conclusion, I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. WITH reference to our telephone conversation yesterday, I write to confirm what I said to you about Ryan’s views on the proposed instructions to Dickson, which are outlined in paragraph 6 of Fowle’s official letter of the 25th October regarding Saudi-Koweit relations. On a cursory reading of that letter, Ryan concurred generally in the proposed instructions, except for the opening clause, which states that Ibn Saud intends to reduce Koweit to the same sort of position as Asir. In Ryan’s view, it I have, &amp;c. T. G. FOWLE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. [E 7141/16/91] 3 .— Mr. Johnstone to Mr. Laithwaite. My dear Laithwaite, Foreign Office, November '25, 1933.8 . He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the ■conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of a general liability for the protection of the whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel ^fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty, Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty’s Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, I am to observe that, in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh’s successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty’s Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment. He presumes, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty’s Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing in a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. 10. Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon.

IN reply to your confidential despatch of the 25th October, on the subject of the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence [Nos. 3, 4 and 5], copies of which have already been sent to you and to the ^Government of India.A 20 2. In the light of the correspondence in question, the Secretary of State agrees that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not 01 the present be further pursued. , 3. On the subject of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Saud, the Secretary of State, in the light of the considerations adduced paragraphs 3-6 of the Foreign Office letter of the 24th lebruary, agrees with tl course of action therein suggested by Sir John Simon. I am to request that you will be good enough to instruct Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh accordingly, and that you will in due course submit a further report when the result of Colonel Dickson’s discussions with his Excellency is known and you are in a position to make recommendations as to the line to be adopted in puisuing this matter with the sheikh. 4. On the question of the obligations of His Majesty s Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, you will observe that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed his agreement with the views contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of India Office letter of the 1st February, 1934. The Foreign Office print, of which a copy is sent herewith [No. 1], contains a supplementary historical note prepared in this Office on the question of the view taken in 1928-29 as to the liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit against aggression from outside 5 . The Secretary of State would be glad in due course to receive your views on the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of India Office letter of the 1 st February for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. The matter is not one of immediate urgency, and it may well be that, as suggested by the Secretaiy of State for Foreign Affairs, there may be advantage in deferring any reference to it until further progress has been made in the disposal of the vexed question of the relations of the sheikh with King Ibn Saud and the questions of oil concessions for Koweit proper and the -neutral zone between Koweit and Nejd. 6 . The interdepartmental meeting of the 5th October recommended, inter alia, that the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with King Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. Disposal of this question has been deferred pending a decision on the matters discussed in the present letter, but steps are now being taken to deal with it as a matter of urgency. 7. Copies of this letter are being sent for information to the Government of India and to the Political Agent at Koweit. I am, &amp;c. J. C.

OOPtfSSENT TO. /rA i 'iffjyobserved that one of the main points to be borne in mind was me fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Has Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at anv rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty s Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit haa always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit s fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them ovei Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. I he present position of Koweit between these two States was we ak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn baud could exert The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be moie advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate on for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant good offices in respect ot Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-buba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,' and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914. that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards “good offices” to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty’s Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [9823] B 2Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-d-vis of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were eommitted to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent States A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh’s interests in any given dispute. Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, und reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty’s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-d-vis of Ibn Saud more -definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might {a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit—a policy which we were, in fact, now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (h) enforce stricter regulations on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. Colonel Fowle agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. We ought, therefore, to write to the Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his privatecorrespondence with Ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be ^-easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A . Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh’s proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinter land, nor was there # any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident’s report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows :— ( 1 ) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh. ( 2 ) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. ( 3 ) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-a-vis of Ibn baud witn regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when i became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent otate.

Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the bheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government.

Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Sand's policy to reduce a p°sition of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. liiis is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that JL think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it must ^ admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article b of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications ol the words therein “who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty s Govern ment.’' On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh °i E^oweit e might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2 . Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh m 1932 the secret messages brought by Ibn Baud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes mtoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself . 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in Y to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, w ic i had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect : Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been puisued through An. Nafisi.’’ On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. , . ,. T i_ o j 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn baud ^rew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh’s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They aie Ai cades ambo, as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy ^ fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5 . The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asirised.” Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— (a) “ You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, whyi be dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) “I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As i things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein' as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ‘ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.’ (e) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with nie, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. (e) “ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don’t trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct wdth American interests, using the others to put up the price.” 6 . It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty’s Government formally assured the Sheikh “ of the good offices of the British Government -towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successorsf 8 scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond/’ under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His^ Majesty’s Government. 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was ‘‘ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him. and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “ the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this “appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words “ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6 . On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for . Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘ protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £ 1 . 000 , and promised him our ' good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain ( 1 ) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted, “ but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December. 1901 (see paragraph 5 above). His Majesty’sKesident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.” As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty's Government are anxiousj however, that— ( 1 ) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and ( 2 ) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit ‘ ‘ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8 th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: “Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11 th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8 th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.Q India Office, February 6 , 1934.

(*) [Note. —The paragraph referred to runs as follows: — “The 1914 agreement states that in return for the Sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks ‘ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection ’ This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance and the word ‘ principality ’ and not * town ’ being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit Sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that ‘ on * strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.’ It is true as pointed out in the note, paragraph 16 (d), that neither the present Sheikh, nor his predecessors appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government but that hardlv relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majestv’s Govern ment’s obligations relieve the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence he Sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only bok for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the Sheikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes Lewis euns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Loyal Air Force as machine-gunners.”]13 [E 714.1/16/91] 2 .—India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received November 22.) ^Sir. India Office, November 21, 1933. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a^ letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf respecting relations with Koweit. I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWART. Enclosure in 2. i Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to Secretary of State for India. (Confidential.) Si r Bushire, October 2o, 1933. I HAVE the honour to refer to your letter dated the 13th October, 1933, enclosing a copy of the record of an interdepartmental meeting held at the foreign Office on the 5 th instant, note by Sir Andrew Ryan on Ibn Saud s attitude towards Koweit, and India Office provisional note, dated the 11th October, 1933, on the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. I discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Koweit, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. 2 . One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs / and 8 ) discussed at the meeting was, briefly, whether, with a view to maintaining our control over Koweit, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that sheikhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agreements with him. 3 . As will be seen from the record, yrima facie, 1 favoured (b) rather than (a), and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Dickson, w^ho agrees with me, has confirmed me in that opinion. The objections to (a) are that, in our (i.e.l Colonel Dickson and my) opinion, a protectorate would most probably meet with considerable opposition from the sheikh, who, while valuing his British connexion, values equally highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arab rulers, and the outside world in general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other sheikhs on the Arab coast of the Gulf. It might also involve His Majesty’s Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Koweit' which can at present be avoided. The question of slavery in Koweit, for example, as part of the slavery question in the Gulf o-enerally, will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no slave agreement with the ruler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local Political Agent can manumit slaves, the Koweit aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Koweit remains “independent,' His Majesty's Government's responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the sheikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the sheikhdom. His Majesty’s Govern ment might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Finally, it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Koweit protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other Governments of “land grabbing” and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas. 4. An examination of the alternative policy (b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relationship with the sheikh may be (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the ruler (see India Office note— Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit), and where our agreements show gaps, these can, to a large extent, be filled up. Thus, control of aviation through Koweit, whether military or civil, would be in the hands of His Majesty’s Government under the proposed air agreement (vide14 correspondence ending with India Office letter dated the 11th August, 1933, to- the Government of India. Foreign and Political Department) with the sheikh, while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council (vide correspon dence ending with Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, express letter dated the 21 st August, 1933, to His Majesty’s Secretary of States for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Koweit in the hands of the Political Agent. 5. A third “gap is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn Saud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The outcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows : There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence : — (1) By informing the sheikh that before despatching any official communi cation to Ibn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the sheikh's custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Saud’s official letters to Colonel Dickson, we do not,, of course, know. After the sheikh had received our communication, which would, of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If, for instance, in order to present His Majesty's Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and I think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence, but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspondence; nothing we can do will prevent ‘ 4 private and personal ’' letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Koweit (or, perhaps, the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (at the sheikh's own request) in regard to the sheikh’s correspondence with the Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Koweit has with His Majesty’s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture (vide conclusion 1 of the meeting). As against this advantage, Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the sheikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter’s treatment of Koweit, in a somewhat different light to Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. 6 . Considering all the circumstances, I would suggest that I be authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh verballv on the followino- lines : That His Majesty's Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him, similar—for instance—to that of Asir; that it is possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him—the sheikh— and Ibn Saud which has grown up of late, even though he—the sheikh shows the eoi iespondenee to the Rolitical Agent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Saud the fact of Koweit’s special relations of protection, &amp;c., with His Majesty’s Government; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the Iraq Government, i.e., through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives; that, in addition, an intimation to this effect to Ibn Saud would bring sharply to his notice Koweit’s relations with His Majesty’s Government; and that, finallv His Majesty’s Government would be glad to learn, confidentially and informally what were his—the sheikh’s—reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon as possible, and when the sheikh’s attitude has become known I will make recommendations as to which alternative should be adopted. 7. The other question discussed at the meeting (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 above) was the exact extent of His Majesty’s Government’s16 is undesirable to say anything to the sheikh in the sense of that clause, as it might conceivably come to the ears of Ibn Baud, whether through the sheikh or indirectly, with unfortunate effect on our relations with him. Ryan therefore suggests that this sentence should be omitted from the instructions. I send you this simply as a record of Ryan’s remarks to me; I gather that he spoke to you in the same sense. Fowle’s letter has not yet been considered by^ my higher authorities. Yours sincerely, KENNETH JOHNSTONE. [E 775/739/91] 4 .—India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received February 1.) Sir, India Office, February 1 , 1934. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident’s despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle’s recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit. 2 . In the light of Colonel Fowle’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of A it chi son’s Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty’s Government in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh’s con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone’s demi-official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle’s discretion, after the sheikh’s attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between Flis Majesty’s Government and the sheikh might be considered when a repoic has been received from Colonel Fowle. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, to which the Resident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of hisdespatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as “protection” is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5 . Subject to Sir John Simon’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle's view that the phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word ‘ ‘ sheikhdom ’ and not “ town ' would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty's Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty’s Government now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that ‘ ‘ the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty s Government in the case of more serious incursions.” Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty’s Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph. Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6 . While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty’s Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government with out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty’s Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty’s Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty’s Government, no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the sheikh 'to a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon’s views on this point. 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the inter departmental conference of the 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be18 unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that committee. • I am, &amp;c. ^ J. C. WALTON. j E 775/739/91] * ' o .—Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, February 24, 1934. I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request that you will lay before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the following observations on India Office letter of the 1st February, regarding relations between His Majesty’s Government in the l nited Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of that letter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. 3. With regard to the question of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Saud, Sir John Simon agrees that the sheikh should first be sounded orally in the sense suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however, suggest that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of the alternative courses of action discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised, Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the second alternative proposed by Colonel lowle (viz., that all official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through the Political Resident or Political Agent and his Majesty’s representative at Jedda), as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty’s Government in - » Koweit, and placing a more effectual check upon Ibn Saud’s attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Majesty’s Government. This course would, in Sir John Simon’s view, have the additional i * advantage that the influence of His Majesty’s representative at Jedda could, when necessary, be more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were the actual channel of the sheikh’s communications. 4. In any case, it appears that, were the first alternative adopted, it would not be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the sheikh. For, although the sheikh’s side of the correspondence would be seen by the Political Agent, there would be no indication of this fact on the document which reached Ibn Saud. If, therefore, the sheikh were to send Ibn Saud a letter which the Political Agent had not seen and which His Majesty’s Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty in establishing with King Ibn Saud the fact that they were justified in doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter would be no less authentic than others which he had exchanged with the sheikh, and which he had been tacitly led to consider perfectly in order. It would therefore, in Sir John Simon’s view, be necessary to add to those of the sheikh’s letters which the Political Agent had seen and approved some indication of that) fact. But such an arrangement would probably in the sheikh’s eyes be as unwelcome a limitation on his official correspondence with Ibn Saud as the second alternative proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle. 5. It further appears to Sir John Simon that, since it is proposed in the c first place, when sounding the sheikh orally, to suggest to him that all his official * correspondence with Ibn Saud should be conducted through His Majesty’s local representatives, to fall back later on the first alternative proposed by Lieutenant- 1 * Colonel Fowle would represent a weakening on the part of His Majesty’s Government, which on general grounds would be better avoided. 6 . A final decision in the matter must, however, evidently depend upon the report furnished by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle after the preliminary oral approach to the sheikh. 7. As regards the obligations of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, Sir John Simon agrees with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter under reply.■ **)' &lt;S) P-Z. 2262/34 CTonfidQntial .

[E 6077/16/91] 1. —Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office, on October 5, 1933. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel (in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan’s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty’s Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful.

Some time before receipt of the above-quoted letter, we had consulted the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. His reply agrees very largely with the views expressed by Sir Trenchard Fowle in his demi-official letter to you of the 16th August. The With regard to the strategic aspect of the matter the Royal Air Force, with organised bases at Shaibah and Bahrein, has no desire to extend its commitments in Koweit where adequate landing facilities are already available, increased frequency of visits by Service aircraft and the suggested establishment of a small canteen for Service personnel were both projects to which sympathetic consideration was given by Air Ministry in view of Rendel’s representations that, from the purely political point of view, these measures might tend to increase British prestige and popularity in the Principality. As neither the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, nor the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, shared this view we do not feel that there is any need to alter, amend or amplify the existing facilities available for Service aircraft making use of landing grounds in Koweit territory.

I now forward for your information a copy of our letter dated 2na September No.P.Z.5573/37 to the Foreign Office and the replies from the Foreign Office and Colonial Office. As you will see, it is felt to be hardly worth while to act on the suggestion in the Express Letter L0.583-S. It is agreed however that a communication might be made to the Sheikh of Kuwait on the lines of paragraphs 3 to 5 of Fowle 1 s demi-official letter of 4th August. The communication will presumably be made orally by de Gaury on a suitable occasion after his return to Kuwait. I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosures to Parsons and de Gaury. 0. K. Caroe, Esq., C.I.E., H.B.M. Consulate-General, Bushire.P. Z. 6047/37 (E 5185/22/31) FOREION OFFICE, S. W. 1. 10th September, 1937 My dear Walton, With reference to your letter (P.Z.5573/37) of the 2nd September to Rendel about reactions in the Persian Gulf to the Palestine Royal Commission’s Report, v/e agree with your proposal that the Sheikh of Koweit should be told that His Majesty’s Government expect him to consult the Political Resident before sending messages to foreign rulers, or other foreign authorities, on political questions in which His Majesty’s Government are interested, and also that it is incorrect for him to address the Secretary of State for the Colonies direct. 2. We feel some doubt, however, about the second point you raise in your letter. Any broadcast designed to counteract th&lt; Mufti’s story that 300,000 Arabs were included in the area to be alloted to the Jews could hardly fail to draw yet further attention to the fact that, though there may not be as many as 300P00 Arabs in the area, which the Royal Commission suggested might be given to the Jews in their 'illustrative scheme', the Report itself says that there are some 225,000. Moreover any other 'scheme” would place a large number in the Jewish State. We fear therefore that a broadcast on the lines Be Gaury suggests, even if accompanied by an explanation to the effect that these Arabs would be assisted to move elsewhere, would be prevaricating and, subject to the views of the Colonial Office, we would prefer to let the matter rest. I am sending a copy of this letter to Martin at the Colonial Office. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) James Bowker (for Lacy Baggalay) J.C.Walton,Esq.,C.B. ,M.C.Colonial Office, Downing Street,S.Y/ r . 1. 75718/32/37. 14th September,1937 * Dear Clauson, With reference to your note No.P.Z.5573/37 of the 2nd September, you may care to know that no action was taken hereon the telegram addressed to our Secretary of State by the Shaikh of Kuwait regarding Palestine. In fact our file does not indicate that the identity of 'Ahmad Assabah' was recognized. As regards the statement of the Mufti that under the Royal Commission's partition scheme 300,000 Arabs would be 'under Jewish domination', we doubt if it would greatly improve the position to point out that the Royal Commission's figure for the present Arab population in the area allocated to the Jewish State is 225,000 (Cmd.5479, Chapter XIX, page 389). Yours ever&gt; (Sd.) J.M.Martin. M. J.Clauson Esqi.z;.557^/37 . India Office, Whitehall,S.W.1. 2nd September,1937. My dear Rendel, Would you kindly refer to the d.o.letter from Fowle dated 4th August, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on the 26th August No.P.Z.5567/37, about the reactions in the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms to the Palestine Commissions Report? You will see from this letter and from Fowle's subsequent express letter of the 6th August in regard to Muscat, of which a copy was sent to you on the same date,that the reactions elsewhere than in Kuwait appear to have been negligible, as regards Kuwait, Fowle suggests communicating with the Sheikh, and informing him (1) that H.M.G. expect him to consult the Political Resident before sending messages to Foreign Rulers or to bodies such as the Supreme Moslem Council on political questions in which H.M.G. are interested, and (2) that it is incorrect for him to address the Secretary of State for the Colonies direct. We propose, if you see no objection, to authorise Caroe to have a communication on these lines sent to the Sheikh. The wording of the communication might be left to the Political Agent and should, of course, be such as not to wound the Sheikh’s feelings unnecessarily. Would you kindly let me know if you agree? You will also have received from us on the 26th August, No.P.Z.5573/37, a copy of another express letter from the Resident dated 4th August quoting an extract from a letter from de Gaury to the effect that a good deal had been done to put local Arabs against the Partition Scheme by the statement of the Mufti that 300,000 Arabs would be under Jewisb(domination. De Gaury suggested that a denial of this allegation could usefully be broadcast. We feel that it is a matter/ G.W.Rendel,Esq.,C.M.G., Foreign Office.matter primarily for the Foreign Office to consider whether it would be desirable or worth while to deny, or correct this statement (which is presumably based on para.39 of Ch.XXII of the Report), with the explanation which doing so might involve. I am sending a copy of this letter to Martin at the Colonial Office. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J.C.Waltondecision whether the or cannot make treat 2 . that the best way of increasing H.M.G.’s prestige in Kuv/ait will be to honour H.M.G.*8 pledges, we agree with Fowle that in point of fact a quiet, but probably effective, forward policy is actually in process of development. The instances he quotes in para. 12 of his letter are individually small, but cumulative. We ourselves attach particular importance to the prospect (which now seems to be not too far distant) of the conclusion, by H,M.G. on behalf of the Sheikh , of a nexus of engagements covering smuggling extradition, and bon voisinage. The conclusions of these engagements in this form will constitute an excellent ccncrete example of the conduct by H.M.G. of the foreign relations of Kuwait and a further step in the direction of closer control. 5^—Meanwhile, ^e agroo-wlbh Fowle that the formal treaty position should be examined with a view( to a definite Sheikh of Kuwait can ies with foreign powers. This is perhaps a matter which c best be considered by your Legal Advisers in the light of Fowle’s remarks and the relevant treaties in iAi^tchison. 6f. As regards the point raised in para. 13 (f) of Fowled letter, I think you will agree that H.M.G.*8 obligations for the defence of Kuwait are, or should be, fully realised by all Departments and/Department. and Services concerned. The F.O. Secret Print No. 14377 (E.6077/16/91) which dealt with this among other subjects was circulated to the Middle East Sub-Committee on the 19th April, 1934, as M.E.(O) 128, and papers Nos. 4, 5 and 6 in that print seem to cover the point. Fowle, with whom I have discussed this point, agrees that no further action is necessary. 6. I have discussed with Fowle the question of the treaty position referred to on pages 6 - 8 of his letter. The actual oosition is clear enough. The Sheikh cannot without our consent receive the Agent of a Foreign Power (No. XXXVI in Aitchison, Vol. XI) and is under British protection (No. XLII). On the other hand, there is no express undertaking not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power, similar to that which exists in the case of Bahrein, for example (No. XIII in Aitchison). It must be remembered, however, that the formal treaty position is supplemented b long established practice and consent (compare Ryan’s note quoted by Fowle). Nevertheless it will doubtless be desirable, when &amp; suitable o pportunity occurs , to approach the Sheikh with a view/f | view to filling up the gap in the formal treaty position. • Bat both Fowle and we at the I.O. feel that there is not likely to be a saitable opportunity until the osychological atmosphere has been improved by further and more effective steps to remedy the Sheikh* s^ grievances against H.M. If while he is suffering from a sense of grievance we were to ask him to undertake further unilateral obligation towards us, it is not likely that he would agree, and a further strong reason against taking such a step is that it might merely have tfie effect of putting into his head the idea of entering into an agreement or compromising correspondence v/ith Ibn Baud. It thereforte seems clear to us that it is best to mark time for the present, but to bear in-mind ^he desirability, when the auspices are favourable, of suggesting to him a short agreement with us to fill un the formal gajp, 7.

In paragrapn 3 of tnat telegram my views are asked in tne lignt of my dis cussion witn tne senior flaval Officer wnicn I nave now nad an opportunity of doing. As the meeting was an informal one I am making my comments demi-officially. *No.C/168 of 16th Aug us t • 1937. 2. With regard to my discussion witn Poland - tne Senior *• Naval Officer - I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter wnicn 1 tnink puts tne matter clearly from my point of view. 3. Rendel in nis Memorandum and at tne Interdepartmental Meeting advanced views wnicn can 1 tninic oe summarised as follows. In tne first place ne empnasised tne importance of Kuwait from tne political and strategical aspect. I entirely agree witn tnis. As Rendel reminded tne Meeting we are already committed to tne defence of Kuwait by land. I originally put xorward tne view tnat we were so committed (vide paragrapns 7 - 11 of my demi-official letter No.1365-3 of tne 25tn October 1933 to Secretary of State for India, copy forwarded to tne Government of India under Printed Letter jmo. 1366-3 of same date). me India Office concurred (vide paragraphs 4 and o oi tneir letter i5iO.P.2.7bcv3/33 of tne 1st February 1934 to J.C*Walton Esquire, CB.,MC., The India Office, London. RECd. POL. KPT. s swan INDIA OFFICE the / )5. / -2 the Foreign Orrice), ae did tne Foreign OH ice v viae paragr&amp;pn 7 oi* their letter hO.S.77d/759/91 of tne 24tn February 1954 to the India Office). I presume that tnis constitutes a decision by His Majesty's (jovernment, and that tne Service Departments, who would have to carry out the defence, realise tneir res ponsibilities in tnis direction ? If there is any douot on this important point I suggest that it Oe cleared up# Apart from this commitment Kuwait is strategically and politically important as its frontiers run with those oi ’Iraq and. oauai Arabia* It is also on the British air route to India and beyond (the Oulf is now the 'Suez Canal of the Air*), and the possibility of oil being found there adds to its importance, especially in view of the fact that tne other main supply of oil in the uulf, with the exception of Bahrain, is situated in a foreign country - Iran# (Rendel stressed this point). 4. On the subject of Kuwait Oil Rendel remarked (paragraph 9 of nis Memorandum)! *The fact that British oil interests allowed an American oil company to obtain so large a snare in exploiting the oil possibilities of Kuwait has considerably strengthened the Snaikn l s hands'. Whether this has, or has not, strengthened the Shaikh's hands surely the responsibility is not entirely that of British oil interests V When tne Gulf (American) Oil Company competed for tne Kuwait concession with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company His Majesty's Government decided not to stand on the Shaikh's agreement with them that he would not give an oil concession without their sanction, and permitted free competition. If His Majesty's Government had told the Shaikh that we required nim to give the concession to the Anglo-Iranian oil Company he would nave done so. ( I pointed this out at an Interdepartmental Meeting held on October otn 1933).-3- (S' 5. Rendel lurcner advocated tnat a more 1 orwara policy snould be adopted in Kuwait witn tne tollowing cojects i A. To obtain more control over tne J 5 nai&lt;n oi Kuwait. 3, To prevent tne absorption oi Kuwait oy eitner * Iraq or Saudi Arabia# c. To provide an alternative air base at Kuwait in tne event ol our position in ‘Iraq being materially impaired. As a first step in tnis forward policy nendel suggested tne establishment at Kuwait of a small naval Station consist ing of a canteen and recreation ground, and a rioyal Air i?orce base eorresnondin/z in size to tne .Naval Station. 6. Witn regard to tne purpose underlying A. As 1 under stand it Kendel’s chief end in advocating more control over tne snaifcn was for us to be in a position to inauce tne latter to come to terms witn 1 Iraq and Saudi Arabia on tne various questions: Blockade, Smuggling etc. over wnicn tnere is dis agreement. I agree witn nendel tnat it is unfortunate tnat tnese differences should exist, but I also entirely agree witn tne India Office views las given by you at tne Meeting) tnat tne best way of establisning our influence over tne Snaikn would be to implement our promise and assurance to tne latter in tne matter of tne Date Dardens and tne Saudi Blockade respectively. If it is a case of bargaining, tnat is to say if for example of nis own free will in order to induce tne Iraqis to settle tne Date Darden question tne Snaikn is prepared to assist in tne smuggling, tnen tnat is one tning. I am, nowever, definitely opposed, as you are aware, to bringing pressure on tne snaikn for tne benefit of eitner 1 Iraq or Saudi Arabia witnout nis obtaining any corresponding benefit for nimself.?• with regard to tne lirst; step in a torward policy tnat Rendel proposes in order to attain his tnree objects, i*e# tne establisnment or small naval and hoyal Air i?‘orce Stations witn canteen and recreation racilities. 1 am airaid tnat i enLirely disagree witn Kendel, (witn wnom de saury apparently generally concurred), tnat tne establismnent or sucn stations would nave any practical errect at all towards tne desired objects, wniie his view tnat by tne presence or these stations M tne psycnologi- cal ei’rect would be considerable** seems to me deiinitely lar retched. Fifty years ago there might nave been something in Rondel*s general contention tnat in order to support British rights and interests in Kuwait one must necessarily nave a snow of armed force there, but this is hardly tne case to-day. 8. to turn in detail to tne objects wnicn Kendel nas in view. A. More control over the Snaiicn. Whatever may be tne purpose to which this control is put (see paragraph 6 above) personally l cannot see that tne Stations will nave any effect whatever on the SnaiKn towards this end. As I nave pointed out before the Rulers of tne Arab coast, (and particularly the Snaiicn of Kuwait), are no longer in tne 'bead and bludgeon' age, when they could be successfully cajoled by tne offer of a bag or beads in one nand, and a flourish from a thick stick in tne other, mey are fully alive to tne fact tnat tney are living in post-#ar not pre-war days. They know something about tne principles of tne League or iMations, and tne moral rights of small States. In particular they are well conversant witn tneir Treaties witn nis Majesty* s government, and nave a pretty snrewd guess as to what tne latter can, and more particularly wnat tnay can*t, do to tnem. This being so i cannot /•O- cannot see wnat over-awing eii ect ( ii tnis is wnat rtenaei means) tne ’♦frequent presence or Britisn sailors on snore” proceeding peacefully on tneir lawful occasions to piay root ball on tJaeir recreation ground, or to slaxe tneir tnirst at tile canteen, would nave eitner on tne snaiicn or nis people. We nave got not a small, out a fairly large, naval .base at Banrain and an important aerodrome and rortiiied nest bouse at snarjan, but these are mere facilities and give me as Resident no more ♦•control** over tne shaiJcns of Banrain and Sharjan tnan I nad before tney existed. The same would be tne case witn any similar facilities obtained at Kuwait. 9. (l). B. Tne prevention of tne absorption of Kuwait by eitner ♦Iraq or baudi Arabia . 1 naturally entirely agree tnat tnis danger snould be met, out 1 sun not of opinion tnat tne establisnment of tne small stations in question would maice our position in Kuwait vis a vis eitner of tnese two Powers any different to wnat it is now. we are not dealing witn a parcel of Saudi or Iraqi Bedouin tribes wno mignt be impressed by a snow of armed force in Kuwait, but witn tne Governments of two countries in treaty relations witn nis Majesty^ Government, wno are perfectly aware of our position in tnat State. Our insurance against tne absorption oi Kuwait by eitner of tnese two Powers does not - in my opinion - rest on tne establisnment of a local snow of armed forces but on tne tact tnat botn tne Powers concerned Jcnow tnat by our Agreements witn tne Snaikn we nave a very special position tnere, wnicn position we intend to maintain, and tnat if necessary we are pr eparea /6 prepared to protect Kuwait oy lorce (see para- grapn 2 a&amp;ove)# (2). in connection witn tnis danger or absorption tne lollowing remar ks oi Kennel at tne meeting, tnougn tney were not discussed, appear to me to raise a very serious issues k endel pointed out tnat our treaty relationship witn tne shaiicn was at present vague and uncertain# Ihere was no clear and comprenensive treaty binding nim to the Britisn connexion, and we mignt rind our selves on very poor legal ground lor object ing ii ne were to coniront us witn a lait accompli , mt* Kendel considered tnat it was by no means impossible tnat tne bhai^n mignt negotiate a secret agreement witn Ibn baud, accepting oaudi suzerainty but retaining a large measure oi autonomy. Wnile Ibn baud was unliKely to rail in witn sucn a sugges tion at present, ne mignt easily do so it matters went wrong in Palestine ana Angio- baudi relations were to deteriorate# ^ere we to be conironted witn sucn a treaty, our position would be very diriicult, and it mignt be practically impossioie to recover our position in Kuwait witnout tne use or lorce or witnout quarrelling witn Ibn baud.** 1 do not Know wnether nis Majesty^ government agree witn Headers assumption tnat tne two Kulers in question could maKe sucn a treaty. Personally I reel inclined /fv, b- H t 2-0. -7- inclined “Co aouDt it* J?ne position as re^aras oar control over tne ioreign relations oi Kuwait was aealt witn in paragrapns 5 - o oi my letter jso# 191-3 oi tne otn naarcn 1930 to Metcalie* pare icuiarxy in paragrapn o of tnat letter* mere is tne gap in our control referred to tnereiu - tnat tne tinai&amp;n, unliJce tne Kulers of tne otner Snaiicnaoms, can communicate witn foreign Kulers, but it is a long step irom tnat to nis naving tne power to maice a treaty suen as K end el suggests, and I snould nave tnougiit tnat tne Snalien’s obligations to us as outlined in paragrapn 0 of my letter just quoted prevented nim by implica tion from entering into any suen agreement. Besides * tnese definite obligations tnere are tne points noted by Hyan in paragrapn 2 (a) (to) and (c) of his iiote of 31st January 1936 enclosed witn Jedda .Printed net ter ho. 255/360/27 of tne 4tn February 1936* A decision by nis Majesty’s Government as to whetner tne Snai&amp;n can or cannot maice a treaty witn Ibn Saud, or for tne matter of tnat witn any otner Foreign Ruler, snould 1 suggest be come to as soon as possible. A reference to tne Law Officers of tne Crown mignt be advisable ? I may add tnat if tne SnaiFh of Kuwait can inakce treaties witn Foreign Kulers so, it seems to me, can all tne otner Arab Rulers of tne Gulf - unless Rend el oases nis view solely on tne fact tnat tne SnaLch of Kuwait can communicate witn Foreign Rulers, since in otner respects tneir obligations to us are tne same as Kuwait, no more and no less. (Besides tne gap referred /referred to above tnere is tne exception tnat i3ritisn suojects nave not tne ri^nt to live in Kuwait - vide paragrapn 2 v 9 -) 01 ^ i*o.oo7rb or tne 7tn July 1936 to Metcaire, copy sent to tne India Office under Printed Letter jcio#oo6~S of sauue date - and tnat we 10* nave no Slave treaty witn Kuwait, but tnese nave no bearing on tne present issue)* It may be, nowever, tnat Kendel bases nis view on tne fact tnat our relations witn Kuwait consist of various agreements instead of a H clear and comprenensive treaty*. I agree tnat a treaty would be tidier, and pernaps more imposing, but surely tne present agreements are equally binding on tne snaijm so rar as tney go ? If His Majesty’s Government, nowever, decide tnat our agreements do not prevent tne Snaikn from maxing treaties witn foreign Powers, I do not quite see now tne establishment oi small jmval and Hoyal Air xorce Stations is going to nelp us materially* Our action, I imagine, would ratner taxe tne line of trying to rectify our Agreements. C* Tne establlsning of an alternative air base at Kuwait in tne event of our position in ’Iraq bein^ materially impaired . It may be tnat tnis eventuality may come to pass, but a .Naval Station does not enter into t nis picture# As far as tne establisnment now of a small Koyal Air Force base is concerned, tnis seems to be a matter for tne Koyai Air Force to decide naving regard to tneir snare of tne responsibility for tne defence ox Kuwait (see paragrapn 3 above), and to tne desirability oi obtaining an option ior a /9- &amp; a larger Sta'Giou in case laxia lor tnis laigiiTi hot; ax some luture date be availaoie e.g» by reason oi ixa acquisi tion by tne Kuwait uil Company# rnis aspect oi tne &lt;^estion was conveyed to tne Air Ministry, wno are oi tne opinion tnat tnere is ample accommodation ootn lor tne Oil Company and tnemselves (vine correspondence ending witn India OH ice telegram cf tne 2iind Jai uary 1907) sud tnat tnereiore no action seems • r necessary at present# 11# jj*rom wnat I nave written my personal views will be obvious: tnat it naval and/or noyal Air j&lt;‘orce Stations are establisned at Kuwait tnis action snould be taicen purely on strategic or recreational grounds, ol win cn tne .Naval and Koyal Air Soiree autnorities are tne best judges, since I am not ol opinion tnat tne establisnment or sucn Stations would nave any material political eltect. 12# At tne Meeting Held on October btn 1*00 (already relerred to) Kendel drew attention to tne lact tnat in tne event of serious misgovernmeut by tne Kuier oi Kuwait sucli as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Kuwait, we mignt find ourselves in a difficult position vis a vis tne foreign Power concerned# Tnis nas now been met by tne Kuwait Order-in- Council oi by wnicn tne subjects of non-Moslem Poreign Powers (it was American subjects wnom we nad particularly in mind in view of possible oil developments) are definitely put under tne jurisdiction of tne Political Agent# tfitn regard to tne gap in our control referred to in paragrapn 9 (2) above: tnat tne Snaiicn, unlijce tne Hulera of tne otner SnaiKnaoms, can communicate witn foreign Hulers. v/nen tne Trade Agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia is concluded tnie gap will oe filled // N 10 - I rilled (vide correspondence ending witn India Oil ice letcer No#P.2*7409/36, dated tne 29tn Octooer 1936). ine presence or an 1 Iraqi Post 011 ice in Kuwait, *iicn oi course is .nost undesiralale, was not orougnt up at tne Meeting. As you are aware, after muod effort on tne part of all concerned to find a substitute, tnis Post Office is being replaced by a £ritisn one* iSee correspondence ending witn India uixice letcex* x,o. P.2. 2401/37 oi tne 16tn April 1937 to Gable and Jirelesa « Limited). I mention these tnree steps to snov;that as a matter of fact a quiet, but I tninK eiiective, forward policy rias actually been adopted towards Kuwait, and personally 1 am not of opinion Gnat any tiling of a more lorwara and spectacular nature is eitner necessary, or desirable. As for 'snowing tne flag”, on wnicn nendel lays stress, I am or opinion tnat tne one wnicn flies over tne Political Agency, togetner witn tne presence or tne Agency itseli, is amply suiiicient for tne purpose. 13, I am afraid tnat I nave made tnis a long letter, tnere were max^y points to be covered, ana so naa oetter conclude by suuming it up: (a) I entirely agree witn Henaei as to tne importance oi Kuwait from tne political and strategic point of view (paragrapn 3). (b) I entirely concur witn tne India Oliice tnat tne best way of estadiisning our imiuence over tne 3naiicn would be to implement our promise to nim in tne matter or tne Late Gardens and 3auai Blockade (paragrapn 6). (c) I am afraid tnat I entirely disagree witn Kennel tnat tne establishment oi small naval and Koyal Air Porce Stations /stations wouia nave ai^y oi tne Political or psycnologi- cal enects wmcn ne anticipates (paragrapns 7 - 10). It lollows iron tins tnat li any iiiaval or Koyal Air Force Stations are estaoiisned at Kui^ait, in my opinion tnis action snouia oe caicen purely on the strategic or recreatioiiai merits oi such Stations, or whicn the jsaval and Koyal Air Force autnorities are the Dest judges, (paragrapn 11). Certain steps in tne way or a quiet lorward policy at Kuwait, nave already been taicen, ana 1 ao not tninic anything or a more lorwara nature is either necessary or desirable (paragraph 12). I presume that nis Majesty^ Crovernment nave I inally decided that they are responsible lor the derence or Kuwait, ir', however, tuere is ary aouot on this important point I suggest it Should be cleared up (paragraph 3). I also suggest that a derinite decision should be made on tne serious issue as to whether the Snaiicn or Kuwait, having regard to nis obligations to us under his treaties and our special position in Kuwait can or r^ann or motr a t y a a f i ^ o wt ^ ih ^ / ,pn Gaury .No, C/169 of 1037.

As a result of this meeting India Office telegram No.1751 and Admiralty telegram No. 394 - both of 26th June - were sent to the Political and Naval Authorities respectively in the Gulf. 2. If your attention has not already been drawn thereto it might interest you to read a short article ’’The Strategic Importance of Kuwait” by E.J. Foote which appeared in ’’Great Britain and the East” on 1st July. It is not perhaps of great value, but it does serve to show that we are not alone in realizing the importance of Koweit, and it may well be that this article will stimulate other people to take an unhealthy interest in the place. 3.

Grover ) Squadron-Leader Jope-Slade, Air Ministry. Colonel Osborne, War Office. Captain de Gaury, Political Agent, Koweit. Mr. Rendel explained that the meeting had been called in accordance with the arrangements outlined in his letters of the 15th May to Mr. Clauson, Group-Captain Pirie, Mr. Seal and Colonel Osborne (E 2606/2606/91), for the purpose of having a preliminary and entirely informal discussion about the situation in Koweit. He had been much struck in the course of his recent journey in the Middle East by the unsatisfactory position in regard to Koweit. Koweiti problems were it seemed to him poisoning our relations both with Iraq and with Saudi Arabia. On his passage through Iraq, everyone had spoken to him with great bitterness on the subject, while in Saudi Arabia feeling seemed to run almost equally high. The extent of our responsibility for Koweiti affairs was vague and uncertain, but the reaction of those affairs on our own. relations with neighbouring countries was/was serious. He had outlined his preliminary views on the question in a memorandum v/hich had already 'been circulated to those present at the meeting, 'but he wished to make it clear that that memorandum had only 'been intended to serve as a basis for discussion. Mr. Walton agreed that the meeting might be useful, but wished again to stress its informal character. We should have in the first instance to consult the Political Resident on any proposals. Mr. Rendel’s memorandum illustrated the differences between the Foreign Office and the India Office view. The India Office would like to strengthen our relations with Koweit and also the position of Koweit itself vis -a- vis its powerful neighbours. The Foreign Office stressed the desirability of strengthening British control. This was possibly a desirable object, but perhaps the Foreign Office did not attach enough importance to the psychological factor, namely the point of view of the Sheikh himself. He had two important grievances against His Majesty’s Government. The first of these was that in 1914 His Majesty’s Government had given an undertaking of the nature of a treaty that he should continue to enjoy his date gardens in Iraq. Since the Iraqi Government had been in control His Majesty’s Government had been unable to implement that undertaking. In the second place, about ten years ago, His Majesty’s Government had promised their good offices in persuading King Ibn Saud to raise the blockade. They had been unable to do so. Mr. Walton felt that if anything was to be done with the Sheikh every effort should first be made to remove these grievances. He was in favour of strengthening our position in Koweit, but he did not think that this object was likely to be achieved by adopting a bullying attitude. with regard to Mr. Rendel’s suggestion for/\ for an air iDase and a naval base in Koweit, the India Office, if such steps were practicable and subject to the views of the Political Resident, would regard these prime facie as welcome, since they would bring money into the country. Mr. Rendel thought that there was not necessarily any very great difference between the India Office and Foreign Office views. The Foreign Office were fully alive to the importance of removing the Sheikh’s grievances, and had in fact for years been making every possible effort to do so. But the main difficulty still seemed to be the inadequacy ► of the control we exercised over the Sheikh. At present the only sign of our influence at Koweit was the Agency building, outside the town on its seaward side. On the inland side there was nothing to show that Koweit was in any way separate or distinct from Saudi Arabia or Iraq. What was wanted was some outward and visible sign of British influence, to emphasise the fact that Koweit was essentially separate and independent from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and under British protection. It was really a case of showing the flag. From the technical point of view there might be no need for a new naval base at Koweit, but for general political reasons, and for reasons of wider strategy, the establishment of some kind of naval station there might be of great value. Apart from the psychological effect, it would give us a means of strengthening and increasing our influence at any moment at which it should be desirable to do so, without making any obvious new departure. Mr. Seal admitted that Koweit might be strategically important, but it was a far cry from this to say that the building of a naval base was justified. Mr. x{endel said that all that was required was a small affair/T l lM oi'i ir coUo'.-v;est of the town, flying the flag, and provided with e canteen and a caretaker. The establishment should be in an obvious place. Mr. Seal did not think that the Admiralty would like this at all. Where, he asked, would it lead to? There would have to be similar establishments in many other places. It would all be most expensive. Mr. Rendel indicated some of the difficulties involved in any other course. It was unlikely that we should meet with any success if we urged the Sheikh to accept any British political adviser like Mr. Belgrave at Bahrein. The Sheikh, however, had a great affection and admiration for the British Navy and would be much less likely to raise objection to the establishment of a naval station in his territory. Mr. Rendel suggested that full use ought to be made of this circumstance. Major Grover asked whether this object could not be fulfilled by more frequent naval visits to Koweit. Mr. Re ndel and Captain de Saury pointed out that this would not acnieve the same purpose. What was required was the frequent presence of British sailors on shore. At present there were no facilities for the men from His Majesty’s sloops to land at Koweit. If, however, certain amenities could be set up for them, e.g. a canteen and a football ground, the men could land frequently, they would become a familiar sight in the bazaars, and the psychological effect would be considerable. It would in fact go a long way to make it plain that His Majesty’s Government took a direct interest in Koweit, and would not tolerate any foreign interference there. This was not plain at present to the mass oi the population, even though the Sheikh and certain foreign Governments might be aware of it. —■* &lt;v -lton suggested that the best way of establishing our/our influence with the Sheikh would be to obtain satisfaction for him over the date gardens and over the Saudi blockade. Mr. Rendel reminded the meeting of some of the overwhelming difficulties which had been encountered in the way of obtaining a settlement of these two questions. Unfortunately, owing to the mistakes of our predecessors, we were on extremely weak ground over the date gardens question, which had been badly compromised in 1924, when it had been omitted from the list of international obligations taken over by Iraq. as regards the Saudi blockade, we had no means of forcing the Saudi Government to reopen trade with Koweit, while the Saudi suspicions had a g;ood deal of excuse. Mr. Walton said that, however weak our ground might be y_is-a-vis Iraq over the date gardens, it was up to His Majesty’s Government to keep their promise to the Sheikh. Mr. Rendel s$id that he did not dispute this, but pointed out that the cost involved might be enormous, and that the Treasury were the department primarily concerned. In any case, whenever efforts were made to obtain a satisfactory settlement from the Iraqis they always retorted by referring to the question of smuggling. Whoever was ultimately responsible for the smuggling, there was no doubt that the Koweitis did very well out of it. Mr,. Walton said that we had been informed that the smugglers were Iraqis (Captain de Gaury confirmed that this is so). Surely it was for the Iraqis to take whatever steps they thought proper to deal with their own nationals, and if they were unwilling or unable to do so, it was unfair to put the whole onus on the Sheikh of Koweit. Mf.—^cnq'-l replied that the Iraqi Government w T ere in 01 difficult position, as they were a weak Government without much, authority. They could of course blockade Koweit, but/'but that would hardly bring about a solution. Mr. Walton suggested that a solution could best be sought by co-operation between the Governnents of Irac and Koweit. The Sheikh as a result of his visit to this country in 1935.had already agreed to certain steps. In reply to a question from Mr. Seal, Mr. Ren del pointed out that it was much easier for Saudi Arabia to blockade Koweit than for Iraq. The nearest Saudi Arabian markets for smuggled goods were hundreds of miles away across difficult deserts, but there were many places in xraq where smuggled goods could be sold, e.g. Zubair. Basra, Nejef, Keroela etc., all of which were moderately accessible. In his opinion, smuggling could only be cnecked with the willing cooperation of the Sheikh, or with the assistance of British administrative advisers. But whatever was done about the smuggling, it seemed clear that a closer British control over Koweiti affairs was required. The discussion then reverted to the question of the proposed naval station. The alternatives appeared to be (l) the establishment of a regular fortified naval base, ( 2 ) the establishment of a small station consisting mainly of a canteen and recreation ground, and ( 3 ) more frequent visits of His Majesty's sloops without any increased shore facilities, Mr. Rendel pointed out that he had never intended to sug t est alternative (l). if alternative ( 2 ) were adopted (l) could no doubt be developed later on if this were found neceosary. But he entirely agreed that it was unnecessary and would be unduly expensive at present. as regards alternative ( 3 ) Captain de Oanry pointed out/out that it would have no advantage over the present situation, since there were no facilities for men to land. What was required was the familiarisation of the inhabitants of Koweit with the sight of British sailors, etc. It was agreed that in these circumstances the most useful alternative appeared to he (2) and Mr. Rendel and Captain de Gaury both strongly supported this, emphasising the psychological and political advantages which might follow from it. The Admiralty representatives, however, were not convinced and asked for time to consider the matter further. The question was then considered of how far there was in fact any real danger of the Sheikh of Koweit accepting the overlordship of Saudi Arabia or Iraq, and shaking himself from British influence. Mr, Rendel pointed out that our treaty relationship with the Sheikh was at present vague and uncertain. There was no clear and comprehensive treaty binding him to the British connexion, and we might find ourselves on very poor legal ground for objecting if he were to confront us with a fait accompli . Mr. Rendel considered that it was by no means impossible that the Sheikh might negotiate a secret agreement with Ibn Baud, accepting Saudi suzereignty but retaining a large measure of autonomy. While Ibn Saud was unlikely to fall in with such a suggestion at present, he might easily do so if matters went wrong in Palestine and Anglo-Saudi relations were to deteriorate. Were we to be confronted with such a treaty, our position would be very difficult, and it might be practically impossible to recover our position in Koweit without the use of force or without quarrelling with Ibn Saud. Colonel Osborne asked whether it was really essential that/that we should maintain our position in Koweit at all, Mr. Hendel replied that the whole discussion hitherto had proceeded on the assumption that we could not afford to abandon Koweit or to allow any other pov/er to occupy it. This had been an old established principle of British policy and had even led to acute controversy with Germany before the War. If, however, the War Office wished to call this principle in question, perhaps the best plan would be to refer the matter to Chiefs of Staff Committee as had been done in the case of the Yemen, so that we might be sure that we were working on sound premises. a premise of the argument hitherto had been that it was essential that we should maintain our position in Koweit. Mr. Rumbold said that he doubted whether a reference to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee would carry us further. Whatever the decision on the strategic aspect of the question it was essential that we should maintain our position in Koweit for political reasons. We could not allow Saudi Arabia or Iraq to absorb Koweit because of the reactions of any such event on the attitude towards us of our other Arabian protected states in the Gulf. If we abandoned Koweit our position in Bahrein, Qatar, and the Trucial coast was likely to be seriously weakened. Mr. Rendel further pointed out that we were already committed to protect Koweit by land. Further if oil were iound in paying quantities in Koweit, as now seemed probable, it seemed of great importance that we should maintain our hold on the principality, since it might prove a most important source of oil for the British Navy in time oi war, particularly if anything were to go wrong in Southern/Southern Persia. Squadron-Leader Jope Slade asked what Mr. Rende? had in mind when he suggested the establishment of an air base in Koweit. Mr. Rendel replied that what he contemplated was something corresponding to the proposed naval station - i.e. an aerodrome and a few sheds with a canteen and a petrol store. He did not contemplate a fortified base, but some kind of station which could be developed if necessary, and which would give us a right to be there and enable us to show the flag. From the strategic point of view it seemed that it might be very useful to maintain an air station at Koweit so as to insure against trouble in Iraq_. Although the range of aircraft was no doubt becoming longer, and Koweit might perhaps not be easily defensible if a definite attack were launched against us in Iraq,, it might nevertheless be very useful to have an air station under entirely British control at this point on the route to India, if at any time serious internal disorder were to break out in Iraq, or the security of our normal communications were otherwise threatened. For example, landing and refuelling facilities in Iraq might easily become precarious, while in Koweit we were free to establish a station under our complete and permanent control where we should be able to take our own steps to maintain order and security in case of need. Mr. Se al reverting to the question of the proposed naval establishment said that he did not see that this would affect the situation. What mattered in his view was our prestige in the East. If our position v/ere strong the Sheikh/Sheikh would he loyal to his British connexion in any case, while if it were weak the naval station would not make any difference. Mr. Rendel replied that, although our international prestige was an important factor, the actual presence of British sailors on Koweiti soil would prohahly make a more direct appeal to the population of the principality. Moreover, it seemed to him that the situation might easily he a very evenly balanced one v/here a very small factor might tip the scale. At present there was practically nothing to show our authority in Koweit. We could not, in nis view, hope to maintain our position there against the various risks which threatened it with so small and inadequate an establishment. Mr,. Seal suggested that the proper way to ensure our position in Koweit was to make it clear to the Sheikh that we were strong, and that we would not stand any nonsense. His view was that it was a had mistake to try and run backward areas such as the Gulf on League of Nations’ principles. Mr. Rondel pointed out that Koweit - unlike the Persian Islands in the Persian Gulf was a place where we had a legal claim to establish ourselves. We could now establish ourselves there without violating any international principle, and quite consistently with our general policy. If, however, we waited indefinitely the position might become much more difficult. Mr. Runbold said that the India Office considered a canteen, etc., might well be useful, but as part of a policy, the other part of which would be the pressing on with our efforts to redress the Sheikh's legitimate grievances./grievances. It was eventually agreed (l) that Mr. Seal should submit the results of the discussion to the authorities in the Admiralty and ascertain their views as to the possibility of setting up some kind of naval establishment in Koweit, (2) that, if the Admiralty were prepared to consider the matter further, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf should be consulted by air mail the India Office simultaneously consulting the Political Resident in the Gulf and the Government of India and (3) that Squadron Leader Jope-Slade should similarly discuss with the Air Ministry the question of a possible establishment of an aerodrome and landing and refuelling facilities. It was agreed that if the matter were further proceeded with, the next step after receiving the views of the local authorities, would be for it to be considered by the Middle East Sub Committee.y d«ar Biggallay, ill you plauoe rofer to your letter of the ?Ath fes»y» ^ 0, E 2733/2C0C/91, irncloBx?v- ^ rough draft record of tne infonr,a3 meeting which took place at t$ie ore 3^71 Office on 18th * ay to discuss tiie question of future policy in f await.

If, however,/^\A t however, certain amenities could be set up for them, e.g. a canteen and a football ground, the men could land frequently, they would become a familiar sight in the bazaars, and the psychological effect would be considerable. It would in fact go a long way to make it plain that His Majesty’s Government took a direct interest in Koweit, and would not tolerate any foreign interference there. This was not plain at present to the mass of the population, even though the Sheikh and certain foreign Governments might be aware of it. M r. W al ton suggested that the best way of establishing our influence with the Sheikh would be to obtain satisfaction for him over the date gardens and over the Saudi blockade. Mr. Hendel reminded the meeting of some of the overwhelming difficulties which had been encountered in the way of obtaining a settlement of these two questions. Unfortunately,/Unfortunately, owing to the mistakes of our predecessors, we were on extremely v/eak ground over the aate gardens question, which had been badly compromised in 19^4, when it had been omitted from the list of international obligations taken over by Iraq. as regards the Saudi blockade, we had no means of forcing the Saudi Government to reopen trade with Koweit, while the Saudi suspicions had a good deal of excuse, ivir, A a 1 to n said that, however weak our His Majesty's Government to keep their promise to the Sheikh. Mr. Re ndel said that he did not dispute this, but pointed out that the cost involved might be enormous, and that the Treasury were the department primarily concerned. In any case, whenever efforts were made to obtain a satisfactory settlement from the Iraqis they always retorted by referring to grou over the date gardens, it was up to the/10 the question of smuggling. v.hoever was ultimately responsible for the smuggling, there was no doubt that the Koweitis did very well out of id.

'-T--^ Mr. walton said that^aoe^ •: smugglers were Iraqis, Surely it was for the Iraqis to take whatever steps they thought proper to stop it. Mr. Rendel replied that the Iraqi Government were in a difficult position, as they were a weak Government without much authority. They could of course blockade Koweit, but that would hardly bring about a solution. y' In reply to a question from Mr. Seal, —Rendel pointed out that it was much ^ ! easier f ’ or Saudi Arabia to blockade yzyi^At ''“‘trrz? O ' .'i vv , ^ k . ■ Koweit than for Iraq. The nearest Sa tdi [Arabian markets for smuggled goods were hundreds of miles away across difficult deserts, but there were many places m Iraq/Iraq where smuggled goods could be sold, e.g. Zubair, basra, Nejef, Kerbela etc., all of v/hich were moderately accessible. In his opinion, smuggling could only be checked with the willing cooperation of the Sheikh, or with the assistance of British administrative advisers. But whatever was done about the smuggling, it seemed clear that a closer British control over Koweiti affairs was required. The discussion then reverted to the question of the proposed naval station. The alternatives appeared to be (l) the establishment of a regular fortified naval base, (&amp;) the establishment of a small station consisting mainly of a canteen and recreation ground, and (3) more frequent visits of His Majesty’s sloops without any increased shore facilities. Mr. Rendel pointed out that he had never intended to suggest alternative (l).If alternative (2) were adopted (l) could no doubt be developed later on if this were found necessary. But he entirely agreed that it uas unnecessary and would be unduly expensive at present. \ As regards alternative (3) Captain de Gaury pointed out that it would have no advantage over the present situation, since there were no facilities for men to land. What was required was the familiarisation of the inhabitants of Koweit with the sight of British sailors, etc. It was agreed that in these circumstances the most useful alternative appeared to be (&lt; 5 ) and mr. Rendel and Captain de Gaury both strongly supported this, emphasising the psychological and political advantages which might follow from it. The Admiralty representatives, however, v ere not convinced/convince ..a and asked for time to consider the matter further. 9 The question was then considered of how far there was in fact any real danger of th: Sheikh of Koweit accepting the overlordship of Saudi Arabia or Iraq, and shaking himself from British influence. Mr. Rendel pointed out that our treaty relationship with the Sheikh was at present vague and uncertain. There was no clear and comprehensive treaty binding him to the British connexion, and we might find ourselves on very poor legal ground for objecting if he were to confront us with a fait accompli . Mr. Rendel considered that it was by no means impossible that the Sheikh.might negotiate a secret agreement with Ibn Saud, accepting Saudi suzereignty but retaining a large measure of autonomy. While Ibn Baud was unlikely to fall in v/ith such a suggestion at present, he mighteasily do ao if matte pa v^cmt ^ Palestine and Anglo-Saudi relations were to deteriorate. Were we to be confronted with such a treaty, our position would oe very difficult, and it might be practically impossible to recover our position in Koweit without the use of force or without quarrelling with Ibn Saud. Colonel Osborne asked whether it was really essential that we should maintain our position in Koweit at all. Mr. Rendel replied that the whole discussion hitherto had proceeded on t 1 -: assumption that we could not afford to abandon Koweit or to allow any other pooer to occupy it. This had been an old established principle of British policy and had even led to acute controversy with Germany before the War. If, however, the V.ar Office wished to call this principle in question, perhaps the best plan would be to refer the matter to Chiefs of Staff Committee/Committee as had been done in the case of the Yemen, so that we might be sure that we were working on sound premises. A premise of the argument hitherto had been that it was essential that we should maintain the strategic aspect of the question it was vis our other Arabian protected states in the Gulf wafi—be maintained. If we abandoned Koweit our position in Bahrein, Qatar, and the Trucial coast was likely to be seriously weakened. Pt-Tra-s therefore/ in the view of the India Office, a matter of political necessity that we should Mr. Rendel further pointed out that we were already committed to protect Koweit our position in Koweit. Mr. Rumbold that apart fr^m essential, that we should maintain our position in Koweit iour 'P'0sftlOn vis &amp; maintain our position/t5) /'N by land, since we had assumed this r* obligation when the Sheikh of Koweit granted his oil concession. Further if Vr v o'il were found in paying quantities in Kcweit, as now seemed probable, it seemed of great importance that we should maintain our hold on the principality, since it might prove a most important source of oil for the British Navy in time of war, particularly if anything were to go wrong in Southern Persia. Squadron-Leade r Jope Slade asked what Mr. Rendel had in mind when he suggested the establishment of an air base in Koweit. Mr. Rende l replied that what he contemplated was something corresponding to the proposed naval station - i.e. an aerodrome and a few sheds with a canteen ;?nd a petrol store. He did not contemplate a fortified base, but some kind of station which could be- developed if/if necessary, and which would give us a right to be there and enable us to show the flag. Prom the strategic point of view it seemed that it might be very useful to maintain an air station at Koweit so as to insure against trouble in Iraq. Although the range of aircraft was no doubt becoming longer, and Koweit might perhaps not be easily defensible if a definite attack were launched against us in Iraq, it might nevertheless be very useful to have an air station under entirely British control at this point on the route to India, if at any time serious internal disorder were to break out in Iraq, or the security of our normal communications were otherwise threatened. For example, landing and refuelling facilities in Iraq might easily become precarious, while in Koweit we were free to establish a station under our complete and permanent tontrol where we should be able to take our own steps to maintain order and security/security in case of need. ~7Z J Mr. SoaI reverting to the question of the proposed naval establishment said that he did not see that this would affect the situation. What mattered in his view was our prestige in the Mast. If our position were strong the Sheikh would be loyal to his British connexion in any case, while if it v.ere weak the naval station would not make any difference. Mr. Rendel replied that, although our international prestige was an important factor, the actual presence of British sailors on Koweiti soil would probably make a more direct appeal to the population of the principality. Moreover, it seemed to him that the situation might easily be a very evenly balanced one where a very small factor might tip the scale. At present there was practically nothing to show our authority in Koweit. We could not, in his view, hope to maintain our position the re/(Tf) there against the various risks which threatened it with so small and inadequate an establishment. Hr. Seal suggested that it was inconsistent with our avowed policy to make any show of force. Hr. Rendel pointed out that Koweit - unlike the Persian Islands in the Persian Gulf.-was a place where we had a legal claim to establish ourselves. Vve could now establish oujr&amp;elves there without violating any international principle, and quite consistently with our general policy. If, however, we waited indefinitely the position Admiralty and ascertain their views as to the possibility of setting up some kind of naval establishment in Koweit, (‘P) that, if the Admiralty were prepared to consider \V^ 'I _ a- .. - &amp;Jr&gt; might become much more difficult. ^ It was eventually agreed (l) that o-r ^r. Seal should submit the results of the discussion to the authorities in the the/(3)/ Kowei t affairs . Since you last saw these files we have received the following papers from the Foreign Office:- (a) Bagdad telegram dated 10th April at P.Z. 3437/37 on the date gardens file (Flag A). The , Foreign Office apologise for not having sent this over earlier. (b) Jedda despatch No.77 dated 25th April at P.Z.3438/37 on the Saudi blockade file (Flag B). The present position regarding the outstanding Koweit questions seem to be as follows:- (1) Smuggli ng _qn_ t he Koweit-Iraq fro ntier . Sheikh is not prepared to enter into negotiations with the Iraqi Government until the proposed Saudi-Koweit smuggling agreement comes into force. (2) Date garde ns. Sir IifU$irrr9Xd Clark-Kerr now proposes that this question should be shelved until the Sheikh of Koweit has concluded the proposed anti-smuggling agreement with Saudi-Arabia.(3) Proposed Saud i- Kow eit anti-smu ggling agreeme nt* We have now received the draft regulations as amended 'by the Saudi Government. Even supposing that the amended regulations are acceptable to the Sheikh of Koweit it would seem that considerable difficulties still stand in the way of a settlement of this question in view of the insistence of the Saudi Government that bon v oi sin age and extradition agreements should come into force simultaneously with the anti-smuggling agreement.?Cu (Ufa* (&lt;xw ' (E 2606/2606/91) My dear Clauson, telephone on the 11th May, I have arranged with the Air Ministry and Admiralty to be represented at the meeting on Koweit to be held in my room here on Tuesday, the 13th May, at 3.30 p.m. I have also left a message for Osborne of the War Office, which I am confirming t letter, explaining why that is the only date possible for the meeting, and saying that I hope he will be able to attend or send a representative. I now enclose a rough memorandum which I have **•’ not yet been submitted to my higher authorities here, but I do not think there is anything in it from which they would dissent. i prepared to serve as a basis for discussion. It has Yours sincerely J. Glauson, Esqv- Ji QL&gt; The question of our future policy in regard to Koweit is one of amsiderable difficulty and may require an urgent solution. 2. Hitherto our policy has been mainly negative. Our chief concern has been to prevent the absorption of Koweit by either of its two powerful neighbours, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and to defend the interests of the Sheikh against those two countries to the best of our ability with the minimum of inter ference in his internal affairs. We have also sought to prevent the penetration of any non-British foreign influence into Koweit and have sought to insist on our right to manage Koweit's foreign relations. We have very carefully refrained from inter fering in any way in the internal affairs of Koweit and have relied wholly on powers of peaceful persuasion to induce the Sheikh to follow a reasonable policy. We have not contemplated at any time attempting to coerce the Sheikh, and in fact no methods of coercion are at present available. To embark on a more forward or active policy would lead to a number of serious complications and involve a complete departure from our traditions. A very strong case would therefore have to be made out if any such change of policy were to be contemplated. 3. (n the other hand the situation is becoming increasing ly unsatisfactory. It is admitted that Koweit could not main tain its independent existence without our support. It has no hinterland of any importance, it has a very limited water supply (it depends largely on fresh water brought in dhows from the Shatt-el-Arab , and it has none of the elements necessary to self-sufficiencyrelf-sifficisncy or independence. It is no exasperation therefore to say that it owes its continued independence solely to the protection of His Majesty's Gorernaiont. 4. Tiie relations of Koweit both with Iraq and with Caudi Arabia are, however, extremely unsatisfactory. Difficulties are accumulating with both countries, owing to the smuggling which undoubtedly takes place on a very large scale through Koweit into both Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The authorities in the Persian Gulf are naturally inclined to say that it is the business of Iraq or Saudi Arabia to prevent this smu.pling; that persons and organisations in both those countries tend to benefit by it, if not actively to exploit it; that the Sheikh of Koweit himself is innocent, and in no way bound to incur, for the sake of Iraq or Arabia, the ouium with his own subjects which any attem t on his part to stop smuggling would involve, while in any case His Majesty's Government are not bound to take any strong steps in the matter. 5. All this is to some extent true, but the fact regains that the relations of His Majesty's Government both with Iraq and Saudi Arabia are greatly complicated by the extreme tension which has developed between Koweit and those two countries. It is impossible for His Majesty's Government to avoid some responsibility for this situation so long as they continue to control the foreign relations of Koweit and to protect Koweit against external attack, and the reaction of this situation on flritish imperial interests in more important matters is beginning to prove most embarrassing. We there fore have a direct interest in doing whatever may be possible to bring the present unsatisfactory situation to an end, and5. to bring about a real improvement in relations between Koweit on the one hand and Saudi Arabia and Iraq on the other. But it is extremely doubtful whether it is physically possible for us to do this if our present policy in regard to Koweit continues unchanged. 6, There is another aspect of Anglo-Koweiti relations which is of even greater importance. The future of Iraq is fflost uncertain. The present Iraqi Government is weak and somewhat unreliable, and dependent to a much greater extent than is at all healthy on the good will of military leaders, llie possibility cannot be excluded of serious trouble break ing out in Iraq and of our position in that country being much impaired. It has for long been a principle of our Middle Eastern policy that we should have air bases and free air transit through the Middle East, and it was, in fact, largely for this reason that the ^nglo-Iraqi alliance was negotiated. It is legitimate to question whether that alliance can now be relied ux&gt;n quite so confidently as when it was first concluded. With this increasing uncertainty in Iraq, it is for consideration whether it might not be a prudent form of insurance to try to strengthen our position in some neighbouring territory which might, in &amp;n emergency, serve as some kind of alternative. The only territory where this would be at all possible is that of Koweit. 7 .7. vgain our relations with Persia are still far from being regularised. We depend to a very great extent on southern Persia for our oil supplies. It is most unlikely that we shall ever need to use force in order to maintain the safety of our oil supplies. But the possibility of a situation arising where it night be of great value to us to have a good base in this area under complete British control cannot be altogether excluded; and here again uoweit seems to offer the only possibility. 8. Lastly it is of the utmost importance to us from the imperial strategic point of view - and incidentally also in view of the new oil resources which appear to exist in Loweit - that no other Power should establish itself in Koweit, and that Koweit should remain definitely under British control. But the time has passed when such a situation can be secured by purely negative means; if we reaUy wish to keep other people out we must inevitably step in and assume more direct responsibility ourselves. The same problem has arisen in Bahrein and the Trucial States and in the Aden Protectorate. In all these cases, the situation would be simple and safe if we were prepared to assume control and responsibility; while it is confused and precarious so long as our attitude is mainly negative and aloof. The problem which has arisen elsewhere now seems to be arising in Loweit and It is submitted that the sooner it is frankly faced, the better. 9. The special difficulties of assuming greater control in Koweit are well known. Apart from obvious geographical factors, they arise to some extent both from the failings and from the good qualities of the character of the Sheikh himself.5. His Excellency's present policy seeras to be to play off the British, the Iraqis and the Saudis against each other, and to maintain his independence and prosperity by a precarious equilibrium of the three. The fact that British oil interests allowed an . raerican oil company to obtain so large a share in exploiting the oil possibilities of Koweit has considerably strengthened the Sheikh's hands, and he is quite clever and capable enough to make full use of every advantage which the situation gives him. Should oil be discovered in commercial quantities in the near future - as seems possible - the Sheikh is likely to be able still further to strengthen his position and to accumulate still greater resources which he will be able to use against our interests. 10. It is therefore submitted that the time has come to adopt a more forward policy with the Sheikh of Kowelt* and to consider how we can gradually strengthen our control over him. The ideal first step would be the establishment of a British political advisership, corresponding to that exercised by Mr. fie 1 grave at Bahrein. It will, however, take a long time to get the Eheikh of i.oweit to agree to this, and., before anything of the kind can be pressed successfully, it will be necessary for us to strengthen our physical position in his principality. 11. It is submitted that this could be rendered much easier if we could establish in doweit, naval and air stations even of a more or less skeleton type. It is admitted that such stations are not at present necessary for purely naval or military reasons; that bases at Basra and Bahrein are all that is for the moment required; and that the establishment of a new base at Kowcit would have to be justified by political rather than/J^) &amp; 6 . than by technical considerations. It is submitted, however, that political reasons are so strong that the establishment at any rate of skeleton bases would be more than justified, and that even from the strictly Service point of view, the uncertainty of the future situation in neighbouring countries would give an important insurance value to the establishment of such bases which would justify the comparatively snail expendi ture involved. 12. Unfortunately hitherto the question of the establishmt of an air or naval base at *\oweit seems to have been considered purely from the point of view of the immediate Service require ments of the situation. It is understood that the Air Ministry have already decided against the acquisition of land for an aerodrome, while the n&amp;vy are naturally in no hurry to establish a new naval station at i.oweit, which is too close to Basra and possesses too little in the way of amenities, to offer much attraction from the service point of view. lb. There is, however, a place immediately to the west of the town of KOweit where it is understood that two or three sloops could find a satisfactory anchorage and where a small naval station with the necessary amenities could still be built. Land moreoever appears still to be available where an aerodrome with the necessary buildings could be established even if the installation were not completed for the present. It seems probable that the Bheikh, if he were tactfully approached, would raise no objection to these proposals, particularly as he professes the greatest friendship and admiration for the British ftavy and hir Force. It is submitted that the establishment of naval and air bases would very greatly strengthen our physical position in ..oweit and make it far easier to develop a forward policy/ jpolicy in other matters later on. 14, The precise methods, however, by which a irnore forward policy could be adopted would need to be worked out in consultation with the local authorities. (hat is important is an early decision on the principle of strengthening our position in oweit, tmd of aiming at increasing our control, and taking an increasing amount of direct responsibility for i,oweit affairs.

Polltical Reaident in the Persian Oulf. Mr. M.J. Clauson (India Office) The meeting had before it Sir A. Ryan*8 letter No. 9b6/380/66 of^May 26th 195b to Mr. Renael on the position of His Majesty f s Oovernment in regard to the foreign relations of Koweit. SIR AKI2R&amp;# RYaN said that the question waich had to be considered was whether the present control exercised by His Majesty’s Government over the foreign relations of Koweit was sufficient for present and future purposes. He had hitherto believed that our position in regard to Koweit was, so far as foreign relations were concerned, indistinguishable from our position in regard to the rest of the coast. It appeared, however, that there was a technical lacuna in our treaty arrangements with the Sheikh. These precluded the Sheikh from receiving foreign representatives but did not prevent him from conducting correspondence with foreign Powerspowers. The question wes now arising in concrete i oriH, connection with the proposals tor the settlement of the oaudi- Koweit bloc leu de. Presuaubly the proposed agreement must oe one between His Majesty*s (lovemment, acting on behalf of the aheikh, and the daudi aovemment. It was a question whether the ^atiuls would question our right to conclude an agreement on behali of the oheikh. M. RVHDKL thought that, so far as concerned the proposed agreement with the Saudi Government for the settlement of the Koweit blockade, there was little likelihood of the Saudis questioning our right to conclude the agreement on behalf of the Sheikh* All the negotiations on this subject hitherto had passed through Hie Majesty’s Government who had emphasised from the outset that it was one of the major questions outstanding in Anglo- Saudi relations. loreover, the Saudis seemed unlikely to take a strictly legalistic view of this question, more especially as they had already agreed to our concluding an ^change of Hotes with them over the somewhat analogous question of the Bahrein customs dues, although in that case of course our legal position was far stronger* Ryan agreed with this view* On the othc.r hand, Mr. Rendel thought that the possibility could not be absolutely excluded of our right to conclude this agreement on behalf of the bheikh of Koweit being questioned in so e quarter or ouher. There were, both in Saudi * rabia and in Iraq, many politicians who would be quite ready to question our right to conduct the foreign affairs of Koweit, ana who were quite clever enough, if the idea were suggested to them, to take up the point. In such an event we might be in a very difficult position, since, as e matter of pure law, we appearedjg) o (S) to ht-ve no right whatever to conduct the foreign relatione of Koweit. Moreover, the danger wa^ not restricted to ijaudi Arabia and Iraq - both of which might nevertheless be ready to challenge our position in Koweit for pan- rah reasons. The Italians, the Russians, and even the ttermana, might find it convenient to question our status in Koweit, ana so long as the present unsatisfactory and indeterminate position continued the danger of their doing so could not be ignored. The sooner, therefore, th^t our relations with Koweit could be regularised and our legal right to conduct its foreign relations put on a proper basis, the better* It was suggested in the discussion that followed that 8omethi;ig light be aone by formally taking note, in an official letter to the Sheikh of Koweit, of the statement which the Sheikh haa once mede to Colonel Dickson (see Colonel Fowle’s semi official letter Ko.191-3, of March 5th, 1956, to Sir Metcalfe) to the effect that he always snowed all official correspondence between himself ^nd Ibn Saud to the Political Agent, and would continue to do so. It might be possible for Colonel Fowle to write a letter to the Sheikh expressing the satisfaction with which Kis Majesty’s Government had noted this unuertaking. The letter could be so phrased as to imply that we regarded the Sheikh’s statement as a recognition of our right to control his foreign relations, and if a suitable acknowledgment could be obtained from the sheikh, the exchange of let ers could then be regarded as crystallising a position which had grown up in practice - in fact as legalising the ae facto situation.

My dear George, ¥7 In your letter E 1894/1603/91 of April 22nd you asked for my comments on Fowle’s letter to Metcalfe No. D 0 192/S of March 5th about the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the foreign relations of Kuwait. Until I received your letter I had purposely refrained from making observations, as it appeared to me that the subject, though of great interest to me, concerns me only indirectly and that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India had all the elements necessary to form a judgment. I contented myself with including the following passage in a personal letter to Powle himself, dealing primarily with a matter of office routine regarding the transmission of the copy of his letter, which he had kindly sent me:- to Metcalfe about the foreign relations of Kuwait with great interest. I am not sure that it entirely convinces me but I am impressed by the argument developed in paragraph 5. Anyhow, I now leave the matter to higher authorities. I am sure that you will forgive me for having butted into a subject which primarily concerns you but which is of great importance to me also, as Minister in one of the only two countries, besides ourselves, who matter much politically to Kuwait'. 'I may add that I read your above mentioned letter 2./ G.W.Rendel Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office.2 &amp; As you ask for ray observations, I now give them; but with great diffidence, as I am not sure that *1 have all the necessary material for a detailed study and, even if I have, I have insufficient time for such a study, in view of my imminent departure from Jedda. 3, Until the question arose in its present form, I was imbued with the belief that our position in regard to Kuwait, though resting on a different documentary basis, was, so far as foreign affairs are concerned, indistinguishable from our position in regard to Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Sheykhdoms. I had not gone deeply into the matter, but I regarded this belief as resting on bed-rock and it has animated every discussion I have had with the Baudis during the last six years. I imagined for instance that, if an agreement resulted from local discussions of the blockade question, it would be recorded in an Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes. When we went into the subject of direct correspondence on official matters between Ibn Baud and the Sheykh of Kuwait, I never doubted that we had the right to object to it, though I acquiesced in the final decision, which in my view was merely a decision not to assert that right categorically for the time being. 4. I have never understood the phrase ’’An independent principality under British protection”, which was applied to Kuwait in the official communication to the Saudi Government based on Foreign Office despatch to Jedda No.Ill (E 4144/119/91) of September 29th 1927 but I have always set great store by the statement that 'British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements which have been concluded, but on the custom, consent and long established relations of all the Persian Gulf chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat with the Government of India.” I have also set store by the fact that Kuwait was referred to in the same terms as Bahrain etc. in Article VI of the Treaty of Jedda. 5./C!S 5. I agree wi.h Powle that the undertakings given to us by the Sheykhs of Kuwait cover a great deal of the ground, and probably the most important ground, covered by our agreements with Bahrain etc, I have now compared them hurriedly with the agreements with Bahrain, as given in Aitchison. Apart from the old-world provisions about piracy, which may be disregarded, and the absence of any provisions about slavery in the case of Kuwait, the main obligations assumed by Bahrain, but nobby Kuwait, appear to be the following:- (a) Freedom for British subjects to reside in Bahrain. (b) Limitation of customs duties to ad valorem . (c) No correspondence or agreement to be entered into with any power other than Great Britain, without British consent, subject to a reservation in the 1880 agreement, not reproduced in that of 1892 in favour of continued correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring states about matters of minor importance. 6. The absence of (a) and (b) in our understandings with Kuwait is presumably at present of no practical consequence. The absence of (c) however, might easily become crucial, especially in view of the present recrudesence of pan-Arabism. Fovrle f s proposal in paragraph 7 of his letter to Metcalfe would, I admit, go far to tie the Sheykh up as regards his relations with Ibn Baud, but would it go far enough, if the Sheykh, a charming but not entirely trustworthy man, swayed away from us? What would our attitude be, if either he or the Saudi Government claimed that any future agreement between them must be made direct? What restraint could we impose, to take an extreme case, if Saudi Arabia and or Iraq ceased to covet Kuwait and invited the Sheykh instead to accede to their recent Treaty of Alliance? 7. I do not say that the dangers implied in these questions are imminent. I do not think that the Sheykh is such a fool as to break away from us in present circumstances and I think that /that the chances of* Ibn Sand trying to nobble him on the lines suggested in a memorandum submitted by me at home on August 16th 1933 (see Print in E 6077/16/91) are smaller now than they might have been in 1933. All the same I think that we should have a clear idea in our own minds as to the Sheykh f s legal position in regard to correspondence with other rulers and above all the making of agreements with them. 8. In this connexion I note two possibly conflicting facts. The Kuwait-Nejd Boundary Convention of December 2nd 1922 seems to have been signed by More as being technically the direct representative of the Sheykh. On the other hand, the recent Foreign Office letter to the India Office of May 7th, enclosed in your printed letter No. 122 (E 2085/2 085/91 of the same date about the titles of the Sheykhsof Kuwait and Bahrain, emphasises very strongly and without any distinction between the two, the Foreign Office view that they are not really independent in international law but are under the suzerainty of the Crown. 9 . i understand that Fowle will be at home in the early autumn. It occurs to me that you may like to discuss the subject further with him, Bullard and representatives of the India Office. I shall then have no locus standi in any Arabian affair, but, if the presence of the grim ghost of my former self were desired, I could probably attend a meeting in August or early September. 10. I am sending copies of this letter under personal chits to Metcalfe and Fowle.

I was about to do so when we received a copy of Fowle’s letter to Metcalfe dated 5th March N0.191S, of which a copy was sent to you on the 23rd March under our No.P.z.1844/36. I am afraid that Fowle 1 s letter cuts across the answer which you were proposing to send to Ryan, and unless you see any objection, I would suggest that we should now deal with the matter on the basis of the; concrete proposal which Fowle makes in paragraph 7 of his letter. That proposal seems to us to square with the former interdepartmental discussions on this matter and to be one which should be given favourable consideration. We ought, I think, in the first place to wait and see if Metcalfe has any comments to make on it. 1 should, however, at the same time like to make one or two comments on your draft to Ryan, if only for purposes of record. (1) The last sentence of paragraph 2 does not quite square with our recollection/recollection of the outcome of our (r*.\ informal meeting with de Gaury. It was, I think, that de Gaury should Cxf**^*- (&gt;-n t consider the whole situation whsn-lte got^-t-e Koweit and should report (incidentally ,to the Resident, not to the India office) whether he thought /tV - t ths-^elnncy of H tightening up M wascat the moment practicable, and if so what mea-ns he v/ould recommend for 'carrying if—ont. This conclusion, 1 think, was not inconsistent with the general « fat) pav (MfO policy laid down which was Mihat i-t ohould-bo ^ I'-f-i n-j ^nt. r; P g T^cx^--rr-p--pr»-T-f. i aVi » % jMiar- tho Ghoikhdom b,v 'Sitapt-mg a policy of tightening up our control over the Sheikh as opportunity offers by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and H.M.G.'

Department. c uU&gt; &gt; '“iM u the field is that made in paragraph 6 of the Residents letter of the 27th April 1934. This, in fact, is the suggestion to which Fowle is now reverting. (3) As regards the_second sentence of paragraph 3, it'—rs, I think, necessary to distinguish botwoen the general ^ /w4W /V propms^L-^fir a consolidated treaty^and the specific discussions in regard to direct correspondence. We course, find it possible to insert in a consolidated treaty an article about correspondence on the line^ of those in our treaties with other Sheikhs, but 1 do not know if this possibility has ever really been gone into yet. Meanwhile I feel that Fowled concrete proposal does give some basis for a prafiiix^4-»sv-e. If you agree generally with what 1 have said, you will perhaps find it most convenient to omit paragraphs 2 and 3 from your draft reply to Ryan and merely to refer him to Fowle»s letter of the 5th March^rhich will no doubt have relieved some of his anxiety on the matter) and to ask him for his comments on Fowle's proposal. (S&lt;U J. a w ALTON.Mr.Walton, You noted on P.Z.1965/36 that we might discuss this file. Since then we have received Colonel Fowle’s letter of the 4th March, P.Z.1844/36. A good deal of confusion seems to have been caused by Colonel Fowle’s telegram of 29th January at P.Z. 725/36. In it he said that the general position with regard to the Sheikh of Xoweit’s relations with foreign Rulers is somewhat different to that of the other Sheikhs. Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr.Rendel seem to have taken this to mean that Colonel Fowle was casting doubt on H.M.G.’s right to control the foreign relations of Koweit. What Colonel Fowle actually meant was that,whereas we have engagements with the other Sheikhs laying down that all thei r correspondence with other Rulers should pass th rough H.M.G ., we have no such engagement from the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr.Rendel in his draft letter to Sir Andrew Ryan on P.Z.1965 seemed to suggest that H.M.G. claimed that the Sheikh’s correspondence should go through them and that the present arrangement whereby he corresponds direct with Ibn Baud was an arrangement which had grown up and should be stopped. This is not the case. What we have discussed on several occasions in the past is what could be done by H.M.G. to obtain a closer control than they have hitherto possessed over the Sheikh’s correspondence. One suggestion was that the Sheikh should be required to send his correspondence through H.M.G. in the same way as the other Sheikhs. This idea was put very tentatively to the Sheikh in 1934 and had a very poor reception. An alternative suggestion was that H.M.G. should make it plain to the Sheikh that since they are responsible for the conduct of his foreign relations theymust see any correspondence on official matters between him and another Ruler such as Ibn Saud, and that if any correspondence on official matters takes place without their cognisance they cannot recognise it as valid. This is the suggestion in para.6 of the Resident’s despatch of the 27th April 1934, P.Z.3430/34. Another possibility rises out of the project for a consolidated treaty. If a consolidated treaty were negotiated it might be possible and convenient to put in a clause about correspondence passing through H.M.G. It might well however be difficult to get the Sheikh to accept such a clause. The question is therefore not one of enforcing our legal rights over the Sheikh but of obtaining new rights over him which of course is in accordance with the general idea of tightening up control which was more or 1 ese--- Sir A.Metcalfe comes back to para. fc of his letter of 27th Apri n„d makes a concrete suggestion for a communication to the Sheikh. This seems to be the right line to take (it squares with what I was putting up to you on P.Z.1965/ 36)and it might be best to try and scrap Mr.Rendel’s letter of 18th March and its enclosed draft letter and to concentrate on Colonel Fowle’s suggestion. If the Foreign Office do not like that it might be best to suggest postponing the matter until we can discuss with Colonel Fowle during his leave this summer. accepted Co _ letter of 5th March to AConfidential * of 19S6.

These - my views - were given in a telegram: (paragraph 1 of my Ho*83 of 29th January 1936 quoted by iyan) and necessarily had to be given briefly* 3* The position as I see it is as follows* Our relations with the Arab Fulers are governed by certain treaties* Those with Bahrain and the Truclal Shaikhs (including crater) contain a specific provision th^t the Rhaikhs concerned can have no communication*with Foreign Rulers and therefore inferentially should not pay or reoelvs visits without the sanction of Uis Majesty's Government* In the Ku./ait Agreements, however, there is nothing to prevent oommunlcationu between the Shaikh and Foreign Rulers, and therefore inf erentially he can pay and receive viaita without the sanction of His Majesty's Government* 4 . /— 2 — 4. Thffrt is therefor• a definite gap in our Kuwait Agree ments which we tried to fill up a couple of years ago* The result of this attempt is giren in my letter 30 ,388-3 o f the 27th April 1934 to the India Office, (copy forwarded to Govern ment of India and Kuwait under Printed Letter Ho*389-S of the same date), quoted by Ryan. The Shaikh reacted moat unfavourably to the suggestion that official correspondence between him and Xbn Baud should pass through the hands of His Majesty^ Government’s Representativest the Minister at Jedda and the Political Agent at Kuwait. 5. But when 1 said that our control over the foreign relations of Kuwait differed from that over those of the other Shaikhs all 1 meant was in regard to the particular point at issue i.e. communicati ns with Foreign Uulere. Except for this point the Shaikh of Kuwait’s position is similar to that of the other Shaikhs. He ie not allowed receive the Representative of ah/ Foreign Power, or to cede, sell, etc., etc. any portion of his territory to the govern ment or subjects of a Foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty's Government (Ait chi son P.G. Ko.XJUtVI) or to Import arms into, or export them from, Kuwait (ibid XXXVII) or to grant an oil concession without sanction of His Majesty’s Government (Ibid XL I). It will be seen therefore that under our Agreements we have a fairly close control over Kuwait in the matter of foreign relations and othsrwise, and even with regard to communioatlens we have the Shaikh's assurance given in paragraph 11 of Dickson's letter No.C-125 of the 6th April 1934 (copy forwarded to India Office and Government of India under my Printed Letter Ko.358.8 of the 20th April 1934) to the effect that he (the Shaikh) showed all official corres pondence with Ibn Baud to the Political Agent. 6. /3- trU) 6 . There ia 9 however, the t &lt;ap mentioned at the beginning of paragraph 4 above. I think ivyan ie right in e&amp;ying (paragraph 4 of hie note) that it waa decided for the time being to drop the queetion of direct correspondence between the 3haikh of Kuwait and Xbn Saud more on grounds of expediency than of law. On further reflection, however, I do not see how we can pursue the queetion in law. If the prohibition with regard to communication! ie not in our Agreements naturally oar Agreements cannot help ue in thie matter, and the fact that this prohibi tion is contained in our treaties with the other Shaikhs makes the omission with regard to Tuwait all ths more obvious* 1 rather doubt whether points (a), (b) and (o) of paragraph 2 of Ryan*s Note get over this difficulty - at any rate so far as the shaikh is concerned. 7. On the whole I think our control over the foreign relatione of Kuwait is reasonably effective. we might, however, fill the gap referred to above by following up the suggestion made in paragraph 6 of my letter of 27th April 1934 quoted above modified by Warner f s suggestion contained in the laet paragraph of the Report on the Interdepartmental Committee on Kuwait affairs of 3th June 1934. *'hat I suggest is that I should be authorised by His Majesty's Government to write to the Shaikh as follows s- That as he will doubtless remember in April 1934 Colonel Hickson approached him on the subject of official correspondence between him and His Majesty King Abdul A^iis, and suggft^ted ths t official correspondence between him and His Majesty should pass through His ^ajesty^s government * s representatives at Jedda and Kuwait respectively instead of direct a a heretofore. i’hat he - the /the sheikh • *.vaa ucvilliri^ to to thla for rarioue reasons^ but assured Colonel Dickson that all official correepondenoe between hia and Hie Majesty, whether sent or receiTed, was shown to the Political Agent, That the result of this conTersation was duly reported by ae to His Majesty 9 s Zovernaent who received his - the ^haitch* a - assurance with satisfaction, but did not pursue the matter further at the time as he was then engaged in certain oil questions, and tney did not wish to trouble him on a matter which though of some importance was of no particular urgency, That they thought, however, it would be aa well that there should be some record - as between Hie Majesty 9 a Government and the Shaikh - of tne conversation in question, and have therefore instructed ms to writs to him as above, J think that thie letter will fill the gap already referred to in a practical manner. It will remind the Shaikh of his assurance, In case he has forgotten about it, and will ensure that he acts up to it. If he faile to do 00 , and correspondence of importance paeece between him and I bn Baud which he does not show to the Political Agent, we shall be in a position to confront the Shaikh with his promise, and to consider any such canmunication as personal, of which we can refuse to take any official cognisance. Ho communication on the subject of the letter should - for obvious reasons - bs made to I bn Baud. There is no need for the latter to know officially that his cor res pond anc a la shown by the Sihaikh to the Political Agent (though unofficially he ie apparently well aware of it, vide paragraph 12 of Dickson 9 s letter of /j£) -5- of 6th April 1934) 9 and as Dlekson's approach to tne Jhalkh was confidential the matter should be kept ae auch between the Shaikh and Hie jfcjesty’a :&gt;OTernraent« 9. I do not propose that the suggested letter - If approved of by His Majesty's Government - should be sent to the Shaikh forthwith! coming too soon after 1 bn baud's risit to Kuwait it might give a .vrong impression. I would keep the letter by me and chooee some suits &amp;e opportunity, probably when visiting Kuwait at some time in the future, to give it to the &gt;haikh after an appropriate conversation. 1 am sending copies of this letter to Hyan, Walton and de Gaury.Draft Paper P.Z.1965/36.

My dear Rendel Would you kindly refer to your letter of 18th March, No.E.1033/93/25, in which you enclosed a draft letter to Ryan regarding direct correspondence between the sheikh of Koweit and foreign Rulers? 1 am afraid that I do not entirely concur in the wording of your draft, though I agree generally in the substance of it. I would venture to suggest that the wording of paragraphs 2 and 3 might be altered, and I enclose a suggested re-draft. eentenee of paragraph 3, I do not think that we have ever claimed the right to conduct the Sheikh*s correspondence ourselves; we made Dickson put this suggestion to the sheikh privately and what exactly we should eventually insist upon, and the suggestion which at the moment holds the field is that made in paragraph 6 of the Resident*s letter of the 27th April, 1934 (copy to you on the As regards the redraft of the / unofficially, but we have always, I think Resident), left open the question of letter of 9th March, 1934, to the (see e.g. paragraph 3 of India Office 4599 5000 2.36 24th May, P.Z.3430/34). Secondly, I think/think we should distinguish between the^ proposal for a consolidating treaty and the specific discussions in regard to direct correspondence. We aiy find it possible to insert in a consolidating treaty an Article on the lines of those A in our Treaties with other Sheikhs, but I cannot find that this possibility has ever really been gone into yet. It might, I suppose, be found more convenient to deal with the correspondence question separately. The redraft of paragraph 2 is, I think, substantially the same as the original, but it stresses the informal nature of our discussion on the eve of de Gaury* s departure and the fact that he has not any direct relations with us but has to report to the Resident. It is important, I think, to do this as a copy of the letter is likely to go to Fowle in due course. iDepartment. SUGGESTED RE-DHAFT 2. Since the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on October 8th (see record enclosed in Foreign Office printed Despatch No.402 of 8th November, 1934, to you), the question of our policy vis-a-vis the Sheikh of Koweit has not been discussed except at an^informal meeting between the Indio. Office and ourselves in Janua: last, just before de Qaury left to take up his post at Koweit. It v/as only a general talk and there was no question gpeo&amp;ari*!' feeling was that it would be de Saury*s business to size up the situation when he had settled down in Koweit, and to report to the Resident in regard to any means by which, in the light of local experience, he thought we might tighten up r o^±r-control -Q-ver—thg- She ikh-. 3. The fact remains, however, that H.M.G. do regard themselves as entitled to supervise the Sheikh of Koweit*s correspondence with foreign Powers, and steps will probably be taken in due course to regularise the position. In fact, there is little doubt, as soon as the various oil negotiations which conclusions Our are /are now proceeding are completed, and a settlement of outstanding questions (such as the Saudi Blockade and the date gardens) is in sight, that the matter will again be taken up from the point where it was left in 1934; i.e. on the basis of Fowled Despatch of the 27th April, 1934. There is also, of c ourse, the suggestion of a consolidating treaty with Koweit, which was put forward by the India Office in paragraph 6 of their letter of 1st February, 1934. It is possible that some reference to correspond,; ence might be worked in to such a treaty. We hope that it may be possible to discuss all these matters with the India Office and Fowle when he is home this summer.I) \NDEX£0 . z.

The fact remains however that Hie § Majesty’s Government do regord themselves as entitled to ask that the Sheikh of Koweit shall conduct his correspondence with foreign Powers exclusively through them, and steps will probably be taken in due course to regularise the position* Tn fact there is little doubt that, as soon os the various oil negotiations- which are now proceeding have been completed, the task of trying to negotiate a new comprehensive consolidating treaty with the aheikh, which would clarify the situation, will have to be undertaken.COPY (E 1033/93/25) (1) Colonel Fowle In hie telegram No. 83 of January 29th states that there is nothing preventing communications with i foreign rulers in our agreements with Sheikh of Koweit. (2) Technically he appears to be correct as in our agreements with the Sheikh no such limitation has been imposed upon him. (3) By the agreement January 23rd, 1899, His Majesty's Government formally assured the Sheikh of ”the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors so long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said Bond” under which the Sheikh has pledged himself his heirs and successors not to receive the agent or representative of any power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government ' (4) The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on 3rd November 1914 in return for his co-operatio/i against the Turks contained an assurance that ’’Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection”. (5) Tn succeeding years we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on good behaviour of the Sheikh. (6) Tn the record of the Meeting held at the Foreign Office on 5th October, 1933, K 6077/16/91 it was stated that ”the basis of His Majesty's Government’s present Treaty Helationahip does not rest, as is the cose with Bahrein, Muscat and the Truelal Sheikhdoms on a long series of formal treaties dating back over a century or as in the case of Qatar on a comprehensive treaty but is based only on a comparatively brl ef^ JB brief correspondence exchanged between the Sheikhs of Koweit and His Majesty’s Government since 1899.’' (*?) I’one of these letters deal with the question of the Sheikh’s communications with foreign rulers. The matter of the Sheikh’s direct correspondence was fully discussed at the above-mentioned meeting and a pertinent conclusion recorded was that the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Tbn Baud on official matters was to cease. (8) Consequent upon instructions conveyed to Colonel Fowle by the C.O. the P.A. Koweit approached the Sheikh Print (K 775/739/91) Section T February 24th, 1934, on the (See F, despatch to Jedda No.215 of May 30, 1934) subject but the Sheikh’s reaction was that while agreeing that M he had certainly requested His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad to be his channel of correspondence with the Iraqi Government and would do so if necessary again, where any other properly organised State was concerned , but with T bn Baud they were as poles apart, and he valued the direct connexion too highly to discard it lightly’’. (9) This was reported by Colonel Fowle in his despatch No. 388-S of 27th April 1934 (E 3489/739/91) who while making some suggestions gave it as his opinion that matters had best be left alone for the present. This was confirmed at an interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on 8th June, 1934 (E 4082/739/91). (10) At a later interdepartmental meeting it was agreed that the question of this correspondence should not in any case be raised with the Sheikh until the negotiations with the Koweit Oil Company were concluded (E 6575/739/91).

JEDGA. 4th February, 1936. 7«- My dear George, In my telegram No.18 of February 3rd I said that I was submitting by despatch my comments on paragraph 1 of Fowle’s telegram No.83 of January 29th to the India Office, relative to Ibn Saud's visit to Kuwait. On reflection, I think it sufficient to deal with the matter by personal letter. I confess tnat I was alarmed by Fowle’s reasoning, lest it should lead logically to the conclusion that we had no legal right to control the foreign relations of Kuwait but I cannot think that he would wish this inference to be drawn or that the Government of India had it in mind, when expressing concurrence in his views in their telegram N o.285 of January 30th to the India Ofidce. In view of the importance of the matter, I enclose, for what it is worth, a note which I wrote on receipt of the repetition of Fowle’s telegram. My own reasons for suggesting that we should not demur to Ibn Saud’s visit to Kuwait were simply that we have long tolerated private intercourse between him and the Persian Gull rulers, that, if we raised any objection to the visit, we should give grave offence to the King and possibly to the Gheykh and that, as the India Office observed G.W. Hendel Esq. , C. M. G. , Foreign Office. inin their telegram to India No*370 ol* January 28th, it might ease relations and promote the success of the blockade negotiations. I was not altogether happy in my mind about it, having regard to its suddenness and to its being made just when Saudi Arabia ana Iraq were negotiating their much more than defensive alliance; but the balance of argument seemed to be all in favour of not objecting. We all remember the unfortunate consequences of Biscoe’s attempt to discourage the King from visiting Bahrain in 1930. Since then several visits have been paid by the Persian Gulf rulers to Ibn Baud and/or Ibn Jiluwi, without opposition on our part. I am not sure that my list is complete but the Sheykh of Kuwait went to Riyadh in 1932, the Sheykh of Qatar in 1933 and the Ruler of Sharjah in 1935; while the Sheykhs of Bibai and Ras-al-Khaimah visited Ibn Jiluwi not long before his death at the end of last October. I am sending copies of this letter and the enclosure to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Bushire and Bagdad. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Andrew Ryan.Note by Sir Andrew Ryan . Foreign Relations of Kuwait. Col. Fowle and I are in substantial agreement on the immediate question of Ibn Baud’s visit to Kuwait, i.e. that we both think that exception should not be taken to the visit. lam not sure that I agree in detail with paragraph 1 (a) of India Office telegram No.370 of January 28th to the Government of India, as regards Col. Dickson’s meeting Ibn Baud in uniform. It appears to me that this may give an official appearance to the reception of the visit, which has been represented to us as a private one and which is tor that reason the easier to countenance. I have not, however, thought it worth while to raise this point as the difference between “official’ 1 and “unof ficial *• is pretty indefinite in Arabia. 2. What gives rise to some misgiving in my mind is the reason given by Col. Fowle for his attitude in paragraph 1 oi his telegram No.83 of January 29th. He suggests that the position regarding the relations of the Bheykh of Kuwait and Ibn Baud is different from that regarding his relations with Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Sheykhs. He refers to correspondence ending with his letter No.388 S of April 27th 1934. I see nothing in that corresponaence to suggest that His Majesty’s Government admit their position in regard to the foreign relations of Kuwait to be any different from their position in regard to those of the other rulers, except as regards the form of the treaty instruments. It is material to remember in this connexion, (a) that we told Ibn Baud in 1927 that our rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast did not rest only onf / fg on agreements but on the custom, consent and long established relations of all the Persian Gulf chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat with the Government of India; (b; that we told Ibn Saud at the same time that His Majesty’s Government had assured the Sheykh of Kuwait that 'Kuwait shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection'; and (c) that no distinction is made in Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda between Kuwait and the other states named in it. •3. It was not questioned in the 1934 correspondence that His Majesty’s Government were responsible for the foreign relations of Kuwait. The fact that they were so responsible was stated in terms both by Col. Fowle and by Mr. Laithwaite at the inter-departmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on 'October 5th 1933. In the subsequent correspondence, most conveniently accessible in Print j 2 , 6077/16/91, attention was given to gaps in our treaty relations with Kuwait. It was nowhere suggested that there was any gap as regards our right to conduct the foreign relations of Kuwait. *±. It is true that it was finally decided not to pursue for the time being the question of direct correspondence between the Sheykh of Kuwait and Ibn Saud. This decision was, however, taken on grounds of expediency not of law. I concurred in it subject to one reservation, wnich does not appear in the very brief record of the further meeting at the Foreign Office on November 8th, 1934, at which the decision was taken or recommended. It was suggested that we snould 'let well alone'. I said that I snould prefer to say 'let bad alone'. 31.1*36.HO DISTRIBUTION Be cypher. Sir A.

General position with regard to Sheikh of Koweit 1 s relations with foreign ruler is somewhat different to that of Sheikh of Bahrein and Trucial Coast (including Katr).

There is nothing preventing communication with foreign rulers in our agreements with Sheikh of Koweit (in this connection see correspondence ending with my letter No.388-3, dated 27th April s 1934)o 2c En these circumstances, we cannot demur to visit and I agree with paragraph No, 1 your telegram under reierence. 3* Dickson telegraphs that if he does not receive message from Sheikh that King intends visiting Koweit, he will follow Sheikh to Bin Saud's camp on 30th January.

Xhe line might oe taken with the jheikh that toe misunaerstanding which had occurred in connection with Traders Ltd. (one unfortunate result, of which had been to involve toe iheikh in the displeasure of Hie Majesty's Government) had emphasised the importance of a clearer understanding as to toe position, onu that it was in these circumstances toat His &amp;aj©sty’s ^ov^rnment thought it desirable tout his undertakings to them in regard to toe grant of concessions miouia be expressed in a clear ahu unambiguous form, which wouldQ^J prevent a recurrence ol tne uniortunate confusion which hi;a arisen in connection with the recent oil negotiations. Koweit is under British protection, its growing political and strategic importance ana the necessity of maintaining effective control over its external relations, the Secretary of State has also had under his consideration the question whether it might not he aesirahle to take up without further delay the question of substituting for the series of letters and Informal undertakings by which relations between his w&amp;Jesty's Government and Koweit are at present regulated a comprehensive treaty on the lines of the treaty with Qatar of 1916. sir John Simon will remember that the advantage of a consolidating treaty of this type (which would of course involve no addition to the commitments of His tejesty'e Government in regard to Koweit) was accepted in the correspondence noted in the India ufflce to Foreign Office, &lt;■ dated 1st February 1934. : decided to leave the a»tter questions of the relations between the sheikh ana King Ibn laud ana of the oil concessions in respect of Koweit itself and its Neutral Zone. JJie grant of an oil concession for Koweit has removed the most important of these reasons for delay; there is some prospect that an arrangement may be reached in the near future in regard to the Koweit Blockade (thougn the attitude auoptea by the Ghoikii on the question of his claims against Ibn Gaud may prove an obstacle to this); and the question of the Neutral Zone oil concession, a decision of wnicn may well be deferred for some considerable time, is not perhaps of 8 In view of the fact that the principality of margin, but that it was Foreign Office to India Office, dated £4th February 1934 had been made wit;; the over until further progress great/(S' great Importance from tills standpoint. On tne otiier nana, the fact that the Kuwait Oil OOKipony, with its substantial American element, may anortly be ceauenelng operations in the state appears to furnish an additional argument for echodying the relations between the sheikh and His majesty's Government at as early a date as possible In a regular treaty to wnlch reference could be made In the event of any cnoll hge to our position by foreign Interests, subject to Sir John Simon*e views, the secretary oi State would in these circumstances be disposed to suggest that the Government of India and the political iiesiuent should be consulted on the question of approaching the iheikh without further delay in regard to a consolidating treaty on tne llnus already discussed. 9. The secretary of State directs me to say in conclusion that in considering tne question of the sanctions, if any, to be applied in respect of the S-ielk*s conduct in his dealings with Traders Ltd. he would have felt In a much stronger position had it not been for the fact that so lon fa as the question of the sheikh's date gardens In Iraq remains in an uncertain state It is open to His excellency to reply to any criticism advanced by His majesty's Government of nis failure to comply with his engagements that nis mtgesty's Government on their side have failedto honour the pledges lormuliy given by them. The present case is an illustration of the difficulties with which His Majesty's Government may be faced in dealing with Koweit so long as this question remains open, ana in sir .Samuel Hoars's view, which he feel confident will be shared by sir John Simon, it is a further argument for leaving nothing unuone to secure the earliest possible/^ TT INDIA OFFICE, iwrmiALL, P.Z.6784/34* &lt;ina Novacib^r 1934.

The Bheikh was perhaps likely to be more careful than in the past as a result of his unfortunate correspondence over the claims, and it would be open to us to emphasise at a suitable stage that we could recognise no correspondence that we had not seen. The Political Agent might be relied on to scrutinise all correspondence carefully. After further discussion, during which ir. Marner suggested that a somewhat better control {right be achieved if the bheikh's recent assurances to Colonel Dickson (i.e. that he showed to the Political Agent all official Ibn Baud) were officially eouaminicateu to Ibn baud as part of the demarche foreshadowed ixi the previous paragraph, it was agreed that natters might be left for further discussion with the Political Resident and Colonel Dickson during their leave in England this sumner.IK DU omc*. mimiALL, i. and July 1934.

C •Hovile, C.B .B., Political Resident in the Persian Culf, on Political Asent, t^iwait’s letter Ho»C-125 of 6th April 1934. most unfavourable to the suggestion made to him that official correspondence between him and Ibn Saud should pass through Hi s Majesty’s Government’s local representa tives, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda on the one hand, and the Political Agent, Kuwait,( or perhaps the Resident), on the other. 3. As pointed out in paragraph 5 (a) of my letter Ho*1365-S of 25th October 1933, since the suggested procedure was already in force, at the Shaiich’s own request, in regard to the Shaikh’s correspondence with His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India The India Office, London. Sub.i ect : Official correspondence between His Bxcellencv the Shaikh of Kuwait and His Majesty King Ibn Saud. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my Printed Letter Ho.358-S of 20th April 1934 in which I Promised my comments As will be seen, the Shaikh’s reactions were the/- 2 - the T Iraq Cxoverrment, no new departure in principle was involved. 'Hie Shaikh’s reply to this argument apparently was that - in Colonel Dickson’s words -’’there was no analogy hetween the case of ’Iraq and Ibn Saud. The former was looked upon by himself and other Arab Rulers in Arabia as a properly constituted ’’Hakuma' or Coverment, comparable to Turkey, Persia or Greece, but that Ibn Saud’s Kingdom was something entirely different, and in the eyes of himself and States like Bahrain, Oman, etc. was nothing more than a Bedouin autocracy, except perhaps for the Hedjaz where Ibn Saud liked to keep up a semblance of an organized State with so called Ministers (without power) to impress representatives of foreign Powers. 4. There may be something in this from the Arab point of view, but politicalljr this argument cannot hold water. Ibn Saud himself created a goverment - outwardly we at least - on Western lines, and^/treat it as such. The Shaikh in fact, not for the first time, is trying to have it both ways. He is willing to consider himself under our protection when he is oppressed by Ibn Saud, in the matter of the Blockade for instance, yet at the same time wants unfettered correspondence with the same oppressor. 5. However, I am of opinion that Colonel Dickson’s approach to the Shailch, which must be remembered was, as suggested in paragraph 6 of my letter already quoted, on confidential and infoimal lines, has done good. It has on the one hand shown us hat the Shaikh’s views are on the matter, and on the other has doubtless impressed on the latter/3- latter that we regard the question of his correspondence with Ibn Saud as of importance. 6. In view of net worrying the Shaikh while the Kuwait Oil negotiations are in progress I am of opinion that this question of correspondence had better not be pursued for the nresent. I think however that at an appropriate moment something might be done on the lines suggested in paragraph 4 of Sir Andrew Cyan's despatch No.84 of 29th March 1934 to the foreign Office. Would it not be practicable to intimate to Ibn Saud and the Shaikh that official letters from Ibn Saud to the Shaikh woulf have to be shown to the British Minister, and letters from the Shaikh to Ibn Saud would have to be shown to the Political Agent. 'further that any letter not so shown would be considered of a purely private nature and could not be invoked against either His Majesty’s Government, or either party. 7. It seems to me that this procedure while impressing on Ibn Saud our special relations with Kuwait, and protecting the interests of His Majesty’s Government, might at the same time tend to ruffle the susceptibilities of both potentates less than the somewhat hard and fast procedure to which the Shaikh has reacted so unfavourably. 8. With regard to Sir Andrew Ryan’s further renarks on the difficulty of checking private correspondence between the two Rulers. I do not think, as I pointed out at the end of oaragraph 5 (l) of my letter quoted above, that any system we could devise would prevent ’’private and pe rs onal”/4- peraonal 1 * letters massing 'between Kuwait ard Riyadh, and if we are in a position to consider such communications as private I do not see that these can do us much harm.

Channel of offioie 1 corraspondence between His iSxoellency the Shaikh of Kuwait and His Majesty King Abdul Aziz al Saud. Sir, I have the honour to refer you to your telegram lio.T/QS, dated the 2 7th harch 1954, am to correspondence ending with His Liajesty’s Sscretary of state for India’s latte No.P.Z.1299-34, dated March 9th 1934 and paragraph 3, to your address. 2. As instructed by you I called on His Excellency the Ghaikh on 1st April and after discussing several other ordinary matters of business, I quite informally and after asking him to keep what I had to say, a confidence between him and myself, opened the question of the channel of future official correspondence between himself and Bin Saud now under discussion. 3. I of course approached the subject with great tact, and circumspect! on^ and employed almost word fbr word the language used by you in paragraph 6 of your Confl d'.'ntial Despatch No. 1363-3, dated the 25th October 1933 to His Majesty’s Georetary of State. 4. I ended by saying that His Majesty’s Government would be glad to know how His Thccellenoy viewed their proposals, which I emphasized were prompted in the friendliesi spirit possible and solely with a desire to strengthen him in his official relations with Bin Saud who, when it suitedI ' - 2 - suited his purpose^pparently found it convenient to forget that Kuwait was in special treaty relations of protection with His Majesty’s 'Joveminent etc, 5. I limited my proposals to altemative(2) paragraph 5 of your letter No,1363-S and omitted any mention of Asir as a parallel. I also make a point of saying that his (the Shaikh’s) purely personal correspondence would be un affected by the arrangement. 6. His Excellency’s reactions were interesting, and entirely followed the line I expected they would (See last sentence of paragraph 5(2) of your despatch referred to above). 7. His Excellency after listening very attentively and politely to all I had to say, commenced by quietly ask ing me to convey his sincere thanks to His Majesty’s Government for their consideration, and for the obviously good intentions underlying the ir suggestion. He particularly appreciated, he said, the tactful way in which their ideas had been put to him, tfiich proved to him that His Majesty’s Government had studied the Arab proverb ’’TJdkhulu fil biyut min abwabiha, lat insulu min al satah” (enter into peoples houses by the main doorwpla, do not attempt t o get in over the housetops). He nevertheless was compelled to toll His Majesty’s Government very definitely and firmly that their suggestion found no favour with him, was dangerous and quite impossible for him to approve of. 8. His Excellency went on to add that His Majesty’s Government must forgive him if he spoke candidly, but be thou^it their proposal had been made without a proper knowledge of local conditions, or a true appreciation of the politics of Saudi Arabia, while psychological, tribal and family considerations had been overlooked entirely. 9. Then I asked him to gi ve me something a little more concrete to go on. His Excellency snilingiy said thatthat ha could not consider the proposal for the following reasons: (a) There was no analogy between the case of ’Iraq and Bin Gaui . The former was looked upon by himself and other Arab Rulers in Arabia as a properly const!- tutfid 'HakumaV’ cr Government, comparable to Turkey, Persia or Greece, but that iiin Laud’s . ingdonx was something entirely different, and in the eyes of him self and States like Bahrain, Oman etc. was nothing more than ft Bedouin autocracy, except perhaps for the Hejaz where Bin Baud liked to keep up a semblance of an organized otate with so called I'iniaters (without rower) * impress representatives of Foreign Powers)'* a (t&gt;) He (the Shaikh) had certainly requested His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad to he his channel of correspondence with the ’Iraq Government, and would do so if necessary again, where other properly organized State was concerned, hut with Bin baud matters were as poles apart, and he valued the direct connection too highly to discard it lightly. (c) Bin Gaud himself and his family of the A1 Baud were Bedouins at heart and in idea^. like himself, they and he not only understood each other perfectly, but were of the same stock and family. (d) He, the Shaikh, and his people originelly all came frem Kejd and ('asim, a nd although they had greatly suffered from, and loathed Bin ^ud* s methods and policy, personal relations had always been good and he am most other rab rulers were proud of their Arabian King, who was to them the champion of a Islam, and the Defender of the true Faith* There such a thing as 'node see oblige” also among nrab Hulers* (e) For hi® as an Arab Ruler to hold uirect official communications with Bin Baud, was above all a matter of prestige. The Arabian world (which to him countedQiy counted more then everything) saw in his doing so t the ci'p patent that Kuwait was an independent Arab State, like Yemen, though in closest treaty relations with Hia Majesty’s lovemment. (f) ’Iraqis by the very nature of their form of Grovemraent would realize the reasai why he, the Shaikh, wanted no direct ooramunic at ion with them. The people of Arabia proper and his fellow rulers, conversely would look upon Kuwait as having definitely ccme under Great Britainspirect control (like a colony,)were he to surrender his rieht to address Bin Saud by direct official letter. (g) States like Kuwait and Bahrain valued above life their connection with His Majesty’s Government, but it was one thing to have TSngland a friend and ally, who would come to their help in time of need, quite another thing to be looked upon as a colony of His Majesty’s Govemment pure and simple. 10. The Shaikh thai zmgrily enquired what I thought Bin Saud would say, if the proposed arrangement came off. H He will be overjoyed', he said, 'and will hold up my first letter under the new arrangement, in open Mejliss, and say ’look oh ray people, Kuwait has now been taken over by England BroIher i-hmad is no longer an Arab Uuler in Arabia. Behold the first step, the next to go will be Bahrain, and Oman. Did I not tell you not to trust these liinglish, did I not warn idimad of this times without number™ How could he ever face Bin baud or any Bedouin Bhaikh after that, said His Hxcellenoy. 11. I here calmed the Shaikh down aixl he continued in quieter mood by asking Thy His Majesty’s Government felt distrust of him, and what was wrong with the existing system, whereby he always showed me, his Political Agent and His Majesty’s Government’s accredited representative, any official letter that went from him to Bin Saud , or which came from Bin Saud to him.- 5 - He called ^od to witness that not a single missive that so passed, end which contained my sort of communication that counted had ever been held back by him. In this matter His Majesty’s C-overnment must remember that he was an Arab Irinoe of noble blood and honour, end so must trust him to play the game* Was it sense to suppose that he, the Hhaikh, who was weaker than Bin Baud, always on the defensive against the letter’s intrigues and underground attacks, and for ever requiring His Majesty’s Government’s help and assistance, would deliberately put himself out of count by keeping back certain of his correspondence with Bin Baud, vftiy, such conduct would place him in Bin Baud’s hands at once, and should be rejected as absurd, by His Majesty’s Government* here 12. I have suggested that perhaps Bin Baud was not aware that he, the ohaikh, made a practice of shewing all official letters to his Political Agent, and that Hi© Majesty’s Government’s proposal after ell amounted to making this plain to Bin Baud. The Shaikh burst out laughingly at this and said, 'Believe me, not only does Bin Baud know this very well, but when I saw him last he twitted me unmercifully about it. He has made many efforts to get me not to do so, clearly in order to weaken me with Kis Majesty’s Government and spoil my relations with you, Colonel Dickson, but I am too old a bird to be caught and not only has he failed, but he knows he has failed and will fail, hence his much better treatment of Kuwait in the matter of raids etc. since you took ever from Colonel More. Bln gaud today knows that I am carrying out my grandfather, nfoaikh Mubarak’s, precepts and policy in this matt e r, which was to allow no one to get between him and tfro British Government'. 13. In conclusion His Kxcellcncy begged me to leave well alone both for his sake, and for the sake of good relations between His Majesty’s Government, himself and his people, also for the sake of His Majesty’s Government’s relations with other Arabian Rulers in treaty relations withwith her, who would be horrified beyond measure if they thought that His Majesty’s Government had possible intentions of acting as ’go between’ where letters with Bin Baud were co no erned. 14• From my experience of the Arab of Arabia proper with whom after all we are dealing in this matter, I am myself definitely of opinion that the best course for us is, as the Shaikh says, to leave well alone# It would be a grave error, I think, at the present moment especially, to start hurting the ’pride’ of Shaikh Ahmad, in the matter of his correspondence. After all ’pride’ is all in all to the Bedouin Arab of the stamp and kind of the Shaikh. The present system works well and as you have remarked in one of your despatches to His Majesty’s Government , if we want to tighten i up control here, we can do so in other and more palatable ways. 15. In the case of the present Ruler relations wi th /CA*- — myself^are, I believe, as near the ideal as possible. There is the closest friendship and cooperation between us, and without wishing to boast, I believe, I can make the Shaikh do most things, if only I am given time , and am allowed to progress in my own way. 16. I apologize fbr the inordinate length of this letter but, as the Shaikh’s remarks apply with equal force to the future question of a regular protectorate over Kuwait I thought it best to give you a full account of his talk with me.

April 16, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 2358/739/91] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 16.) (No. 84.) Jedda, March 29, 1934. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your printed despatch No. 81 of the 27th February, in which you call for my observations on the subject of enclosed correspondence regarding the relations between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Sheikh of Koweit, viz., India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 1st February and Foreign Office letter to the India Office of the 24th February. These letters deal with the following subjects :— (a) Possible declaration of a protectorate over Koweit. (h) Gaps in the existing agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. (c) Direct correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud.^ (d) Obligations of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Koweit. (e) Suggested substitution of a formal treaty for the existing agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the sheikh. 2. As regards (a) above, it has already been decided not to pursue at present the question of declaring a protectorate. All that I need say in this connexion, therefore, is that if at any future time it should prove more practicable than it is at present to declare a protectorate, it would greatly clarify the situation as between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud and would place the former in a much stronger position vis-a-vis of the latter. Looked at from this point of view the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Koweit should, in my opinion, be considered to some extent in conjunction with the question, which has recently become active, of their policy in regard to the other areas to the east and south-east of Ibn Saud’s dominions. 3. The subjects at (b), (d) and (e) above are so far outside my province that I cannot usefully offer any observations on them. I propose therefore to confine myself to the question of direct correspondence between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud on official subjects. There is general agreement, I think, as to the desirability of controlling this correspondence and the only question which arises is that of the best means of establishing an effective control, having regard to both practical and legal considerations. 4. So far as the practical considerations are concerned, I am inclined to share your view as to the inadequacy of the course indicated in paragraph 5 (1) of the Political Resident’s despatch to the India Office of the 25th October. You have yourself pointed out that it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to disavow communications addressed by the sheikh to Ibn Saud without the approval of the Political Agent, unless communications which had been approved by him bore some indication of that fact. I may add that this alternative no less than the other would necessitate an undertaking not only with the sheikh, but with Ibn Saud. It would have to be made clear to the latter that unapproved communications could not be invoked against either His Majesty’s Government or the sheikh himself and that communications addressed by the King on his side to the sheikh must be considered not only by the sheikh but by the Political Agent. If this position were established the effect would be much the same as that of Colonel Fowle’s second alternative, except for one thing, namely, the difficulty of discriminating between official and unofficial communications. This difficulty appears to me to be very great in the case of two rulers whose practice appears to be to exchange purely personal letters and to deal with official matters in enclosures appended to them. 5. The adoption of Colonel Fowle’s second alternative would not obviate the danger of the sheikh compromising his position by direct letters, but it would [81 q 1]establish quite definitely the fact that such letters could have no sort of official character. It may perhaps be hoped that both rulers would then realise that their direct correspondence had better be confined to personal greetings and news. It remains to be considered whether the legal position is such as to enable His Majesty’s Government to impose the proposed system, firstly, on the sheikh, and, secondly, on Ibn Saud. It is not for me to deal with this question as regards the sheikh, but I submit the following observations as regards Ibn Saud. 6. When the Treaty of Jedda was being negotiated His Majesty’s Govern ment wished to include in it a clause similar to article 6 of the Treaty of the 26th December, 1915, by which Ibn Saud undertook “to refrain from all aggression on, or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrein and of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said Government.” The use of ‘ ‘ who ” in this clause seems to confine the application of the words “under the protection of” to the Sheikhs of Qatar, &amp;c. Ibn Saud rejected the clause and His Majesty’s Government accepted the substance of a counter proposal by Ibn Saud, subject to the addition of the words “ who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” This produced article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda as we now have it. The word “who ” stands, but was perhaps not intended to be used limitatively. Anyhow, His Majesty’s Government had made it clear in their instructions to Sir G. Clayton that they attached the same meaning to the form of clause to which they were willing to agree as to the clause they had themselves proposed. 7. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda, His Majesty’s Government communicated to Ibn Saud a number of treaties with Arabian rulers. In the case of Koweit they communicated only the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, together with two minor agreements of the 24th May, 1900, and the 25th February, 1904, regarding arms and postal matters. In the covering note, however, the Acting Agent and consul at Jedda reproduced the following explanation from Foreign Office despatch No. Ill of the 29th September, 1927 :— “His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement of 1899, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices, but at the same time His Majesty’s Government have reserved to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty’s Government have also assured the sheikh that they recognise (1) that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to him and to his heirs after him; (2) that all his arrangements shall remain in the hands of himself and his heirs; and (3) that they will not take customs or anything in any lands they may rent, or in which they may dwell, within the limits of Koweit. Finally, His Majesty’s Government have assured the sheikh that Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” 8. Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda recognises the possibility of relations between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, which were to be friendly and peaceful. This, presumably, need not mean more than that Ibn Saud was to observe a friendly and peaceful attitude and Ibn Saud knows that the sheikh is not free to receive the agent of any foreign Power without British sanction. We are, however, eternally dogged by the contradictory expression “independent principality under British protection,” a definition which we have tried to abandon, but which remains on record as between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. 9. This survey leaves me doubtful as to whether His Majesty’s Government would be on absolutely safe ground in informing Ibn Saud of their own motion that he must not correspond with the Sheikh of Koweit except through British channels. I suggest, therefore, that any communication on the subject to the Saudi Government will be made expressly as the result of an understanding between them and the sheikh. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and Bushire. I have, &amp;e.

(14377) Relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. [E 6077/16/91] 1. —Final Recoi'd of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office, on October 5, 1933. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel {in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty’s Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-lraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he 7329 [9823] b13 [E 7141/16/91] 2 .—India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received November 22.) ^Sir, India Office, November 21, 1933. 1 AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf respecting relations with Koweit. I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWART. Enclosure in 2. Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to Secretary of State for India. (Confidential.) ^i r) Bushire, October 25, 1933. I HAVE the honour to refer to your letter dated the 13th October, 1933, enclosing a copy of the record of an interdepartmental meeting held at the I oreign Office on the 5 th instant, note by Sir Andrew Ryan on Ibn Saud s attitude towards Koweit, and India Office provisional note, dated the 11th October, 1933, on the obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the bheikh of Kow eit. 1 discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Koweit, when I passed thiough there recently on my way to Bushire. 2 . One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs 7 and 8 ) discussed at the meeting was, briefly, whether, with a view to maintaining our control over Koweit, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that sheikhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agreements with him. 3 . As will be seen from the record, prima facie, I favoured (b) rather than (a), and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Dickson, who agrees with me has confirmed me in that opinion. The objections to (a) are that, in our (i.e.’ Colonel Dickson and my) opinion, a protectorate would most probably meet with considerable opposition from the sheikh, who, while valuing his British connexion, values equally highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arab rulers, and the outside world in general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other sheikhs on the Arab coast of the Gulf. It might also involve His Majesty’s Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Koweit' which can at present be avoided. The question of slavery in Koweit, for example, as part of the slavery question m the Gulf generally will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no slave agreement with the ruler, such as exists with the other^ Arab rulers by which the local Political Agent can manumit slaves, the Koweit aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Koweit remains independent. His Majesty’s Government s responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the sheikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the sheikhdom. His Majesty s Govern ment might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Finally, it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Koweit protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other Governments of “land grabbing” and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas. 4 An examination of the alternative policy (b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relationship with the sheikh may be (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the ruler (see India Office note— Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit), and where our agreements show gaps, these can, to a large extent, be filled up. Thus, control of aviation through Koweit, whether military or civil, would be in the hands of His Majesty’s Government under the proposed air agreement (videcorrespondence ending with India Office letter dated the 11th ' the Government of India. Foreign and Political Department) with the sheikh, while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order m C ouncil deuce ending with Government of India. Foreign and Political &gt; P express letter dated the 21st August, 1933, to His Majesty s Secretary of StateT* for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Koweit the hands of the Political Agent. i • u noo 5. A third “gap ” is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn Saud, and which was dealt with at some lengt at the meeting. The outcome of mv discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows : There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence : — ( 1 ) By informing the sheikh that before despatching any official communi cation to Ibn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. I his has been tne sheikh’s custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Saud s official letters to Colonel Dickson we do not, of course, know. After the sheikh had received our communication, which would, of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not showm to the Political Agent. If, for instance, in order to present His Majesty's Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and I think that perhaps it would be better m our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence, but to tieat the- matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspondence; nothing we can do will prevent “ private and personal ” letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Koweit (or, perhaps, the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (at the sheikh's own request) in regard to the sheikh’s correspondence with the Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Koweit has with His Majesty’s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture {vide conclusion 1 of the meeting). As against this advantage. Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the sheikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter’s treatment of Koweit. in a somewhat different light to Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. 6 . Considering all the circumstances, I w^ould suggest that I be authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh verbally on the following lines : That His Majesty’s Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him, similar—for instance—to that of Asir; that it is possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him—the sheikh— and Ibn Saud which has grown up of late, even though he—the sheikh—shows the correspondence to the Political Agent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Saud the fact of Koweit’s special relations of protection, &amp;c., with His Majesty’s Government; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence wdth the Iraq Government, i.e., through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives; that, in addition, an intimation to this effect to Ibn Saud would bring sharply to his notice Koweit’s relations with His Majesty’s Government; and that, finally. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to learn, confidentially and informally, what were his—-the sheikh’s—reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon as possible, and when the sheikh’s attitude has become known I will make recommendations as to which alternative should be adopted. 7. The other question discussed at the meeting (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 above) was the exact extent of His Majesty’s Government’sobligations to protect the interests of Koweit. The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office note on the subject, and e one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty’s Government s agi cements with the sheikh are three in number : that of January 1899, that of October •0907 and that of November 1914. 8 . The agreement of 1899, as far as “ protection ” is concerned, m return for the good behaviour of the sheikh and his successors, merely promised ^the good offices ” of His Majesty’s Government, “ whatever that may mean as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction of this agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Koweit in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty s Govern ment that “ the town of Koweit and its boundaries belonged to the sheikh of that day and his successors. This agreement in no way added, in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Koweit, though, possibly, read with that of 1899, it might increase these responsibilities up to the “ boundaries.” 10 . The 1914 agreement states that, in return for the sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks, “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agree ments, is a most categorical assurance, and the word ” principality, and not “ town,” being used would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that “ on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.” It is true, as pointed out in the note (paragraph 16 (d)) , that neither the present sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Government’s obligations relieve the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the sheikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air Force as machine gunners. H In conclusion, I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. I have, &amp;c. T. 0. FOWLE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. j E 7141/16/91] 3 .— Mr. Johnstone to Mr. Laithwaite. My dear Laithwaite, Foreign Office, November 25, 1933. WITH reference to our telephone conversation yesterday, I write to confirm what I said to you about Ryan’s views on the proposed instructions to Dickson, which are outlined in paragraph 6 of Fowle’s official letter of the 25th October regarding Saudi-Koweit relations. On a cursory reading of that letter, Ryan concurred generally in the proposed instructions, except for the opening clause, which states that Ibn Saud intends to reduce Koweit to the same sort of position as Asir. In Ryan’s view, it16 is undesirable to say anything to the sheikh in the sense of that clause, as it mig t conceivably come to the ears of Ibn Saud, whether through the sheikh oi indirectly, with unfortunate effect on our relations with him. Ryan theretoie suggests that this sentence should be omitted from the instructions. I send you this simply as a record of Ryan’s remarks to me; I gathei that, he spoke to you in the same sense. Fowle’s letter has not yet been consideied bi^^ my higher authorities. Yours sincerely, KENNETH JOHNSTONE. [E 775/73991] 4 .—India Office to Foreign Office.—[Received February 1.) gi r India Office, February 1, 1934. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident’s despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle's recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit. 2. In the light of Colonel Fowle's views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of A it chi s on’s Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty’s Government in the event of 'his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh’s con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3 . The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle's despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident’s recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone’s demi-official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle's discretion, after the sheikh’s attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty’s Government and the sheikh might be considered when a reporc has been received from Colonel Fowle. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, to which the Resident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of hisdespatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as they do ^^merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as “protection” is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle’s view that the phraseology of this undertaking and the use of the word ‘ ‘ sheikhdom ’ ’ and not town would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty’s Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty’s Government now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that ‘ ‘ the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions.” Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty’s Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph. Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6 . While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given cm either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty’s Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty's Government with out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty’s Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty’s Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty’s Government, no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal tieat^, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the sheikh t6 a' consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon’s views on this point . _ . ^ . Aft . . ,, 7 Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Aftairs, the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the inter departmental conference of the 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be18 unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that committee. | I am, &amp;c. ' J. C. WALTON. fE 775/739/91] 5 —Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, February 24, 1934. ^ directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request that you will lay before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the following observations on India Office letter of the 1st February, regarding relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of that letter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. With regard to the question of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Saud, Sir John Simon agrees that the sheikh should first be sounded orally in the sense suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however, that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of the alternative courses of action discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty s Minister at Jed da may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised, Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the second alternative proposed by Colonel Fowle (viz., that all official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through the Political Resident or Political Agent and his Majesty’s representative at Jedda), as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty’s Government in Koweit and placing a more effectual check upon Ibn Saud’s attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Majesty’s Government. This course would, in Sir John Simon’s view, have the additional advantage that the influence of His Majesty’s representative at Jedda could when necessary, be more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were the actual channel of the sheikh’s communications. 4. In any case, it appears that, were the first alternative adopted it would not be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ibn Saud and the sheikh. For, although the sheikh’s side of the correspondence would be seen by the Political Agent, there would be no indication of this fact on the document which reached &amp; Ibn Saud If, therefore, the sheikh were to send Ibn Saud a letter which the Political Agent had not seen and which His Majesty’s Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty in establishing with King Ibn Saud the fact that they were justified in doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter would be no less authentic than others which he had exchanged with the sheikh, and which he had been tacitly led to consider perfectly in order It would therefore, in Sir John Simon’s view, be necessary to add to those of the sheikh’s letters which the Political Agent had seen and approved some indication oPtlbat fact But such an arrangement would probably in the sheikh’s eyes be as unwelcome a limitation on his official correspondence with Ibn Saud as the second alternative proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Fowle. Il: further appears to Sir John Simon that, since it is proposed in the first place when sounding the sheikh orally, to suggest to him that all his official correspondence with Ibn Saud should be conducted through His Maiestv’s local representatives, to fall back later on the first alternative proposed by Lieutenant- Colonel Fowle would represent a weakening on the part of His Maiestv’s Government, which on general grounds would be better avoided. ' „ A final decision in the matter must, however, evidently depend upon the tTthe s f he r ikh hed ^ Lleutenant - Colonel Fowle after the preliminary oral approach tt, 7 ’ t^ajds the obligations of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, Sir John Simon agrees with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and o of your letter under reply P eSSea m10 8 . He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of a general liability for the protection yc&gt;f the whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel ^Fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty, Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty s Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, I am to observe that, in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to^ Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh’s successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty’s Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment. He presumes, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no around for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty’s Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing in a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. ^ oi . ^ , 10 Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be ciiculated later to the Departments represented thereupon. r I am, &amp;c.

Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of that letter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. 3. With regard to the question of direct correspondence between the Sheikh and King Ibn Saud, Sir John Simon agrees that the Sheikh should first be sounded orally in the sense suggested in paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however, suggest that thereafter the Political Resident should report further which of the alternative courses of action discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised, Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the second alternative proposed by Colonel Fowle (viz. that all official correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIL the/ I3^3{a The Under-Secretary of State India Office. Tthe Political Resident or Political Agent and His Majesty*s Representative at Jedda), as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty’s Government in Koweit, and placing a more effectual check upon Ihn Baud’s attempts to strengthen his own position there to the detriment of that held by His Majesty’s Government. This course would, in Sir John Simon’s view, have the additional advantage that the influence of His Majesty’s Representative at Jedda could when necessary he more easily exerted upon the Saudi Government, if he were the actual channel of the Sheikh’s communications. 4 # In any case it appears that, were the first alternative adopted, it would not he sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct correspondence between King Ihn Saud and the Sheikh. For, although the Sheikh’s side of the correspondence would he seen by the Political Agent, there would he no indication of this fact on the document which reached Ihn Saud. If, therefore, the Sheikh were to send Ihn Saud a letter which the Political Agent had not seen and which His Majesty’s Government wished to repudiate on that ground, they might find some difficulty in establishing with King Ihn Saud the fact that they were Justified in doing so, since, so far as he could see, this letter would he no less authentic than others which he had exchanged with the Sheikh and which he had been tacitly led to consider perfectly in order. It would therefore, in Sir John Simon’s view, he necessary to add to those of the Sheikh’s letters which the Political Agent had seen and approved some indication of that fact. But such an arrangement would probably in the Sheikh’s eyes he as unwelcome a limitation/limitation on his official correspondence with Ihn Saud as the second alternative proposed hy Lieutenant-Colonel Powle* 5* It further appears to Sir John Simon that, since it is proposed in the first place, when sounding the Sheikh orally, to suggest to him that all his official correspondence with Ibn Saud should be conducted through His Majesty’s local representatives, to fall back later on the first alternative proposed by Lieutenant-Colonel Powle would represent a weakening on the part of His Majesty’s Government, which on general grounds would be better avoided. 6« A final decision in the matter must, however, % evidently depend upon the report furnished by Lieutenant- Colonel Powle after the preliminary oral approach to the Sheikh. 7. As regards the obligations of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, Sir John Simon agrees with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter under reply. 8. He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh, which should include inter alia the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of a general liability for the protection of the whole Sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Colonel Powle’s despatch of the 25th October referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty, Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it seems inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the Sheikh/Sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the Sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil* interests) have been disposed of# 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty 1 s Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the Sheikh, I am to observe that in accordance with the construction which is usually placed upon treaties with Heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State and would apply automatically to the Sheikh’s successors. The undertakings given by the two contracting parties to a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question that it is considered that His Majesty’s Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovemment. He presumes therefore that His Majesty’s Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a ruler who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations* If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty’s Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing/acquiescing in a refusal by the Sheikh to recognize his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations -with Koweit. 10* Sir John Simon concurs in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon. I am Sir Your obedient ServantjkA THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office on October 5 Relations between His Majesty's Government in the United Kir ^ the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. ^ Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty's Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty 's Government than it had been at any time, since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to ^ive it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. • Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he EASTERN (Arabia). October 11, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 1 9 3 4 [E 6077/16/91] No. 1. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel (in the Chair), Foreign Office. ENCLOSURE in WEEKLY LETTFR M 1 MAR 1934 FROM SECRETARY, political ai.O SECRET DEPT. I NDIA OFFICE OOPY SENT TH — SECRETARY, POLITICAL AtiOobserved that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed,* and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel’s description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit*s fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rend el agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Kow r eit were represented by their undertaking to grant “good offices ” in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914. that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards good offices to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and m Qatar and along the 1 rucial Poast it would probably rouse3 apprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty's Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, prima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Kow^eit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had w T e been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew' attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-d-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But wRen conditions at last, in our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments w'hich might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now' that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Baud and Koweit. [935 1—1] B 94 Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-d-vis of Tbn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority ^ within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reverting to the question, of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh’s interests in anv dven dispute. Mr . Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty’s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-d-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control He suggested that we might (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit—a policy which we were, in fact, now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (b) enforce stricter regulations on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. Colonel Fowle agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction. If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud We ought therefore, to write to th- Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private5 correspondence with Ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Saud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A . Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Sand’s letter suggesting terms for The settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia, or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty's Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh’s proposal that ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Has Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinter land. nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, in the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident’s report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows :— (1) That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty’s Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the bheikh. (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.(4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Jbn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud’s policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty's Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained m article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “ who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.' On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty's Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud's attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty’s Government, the reply was in effect: “Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.’’ On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh’s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are “Arcades ambo,” as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “Asirised.' Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— {a) “ You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, why7 Jk zzs be dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) “I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein ' as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ‘ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.' (c) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “ You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. (e) “ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.' 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty’s Government formally assured the Sheikh “ of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors \3\8 scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond,’ under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or g ive for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the 1 rovernment or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. ^ 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for ther^ lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was “ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him. and that all Sheikh Mobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba. Ruler of Koweit. and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “ the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914. in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this “appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words “ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘ protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our ‘ good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might,* it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October, 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted, “but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December. 1901 (see paragraph 5 above), His Majesty’s&lt;) Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district. ihe Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902): “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it “ only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit ” (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries.' The phrase “ its boundaries' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our obligation extends,' and “ whether they accepted ' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied : “ We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory; (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. . . .' 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) :— “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Larimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits. His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their ‘ good offices ’ in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term ‘ good offices ’ is a very vague one. which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably our prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...' 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.' 12. In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against I 935 1—1] cm 10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the dOth October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : 4 As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good' offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit ” shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. bheikh Salim s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn the 1 olitical Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts contrary to the interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928, the question of the precise extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office,'when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict readmg, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole The history of the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix L, to the conclusions of which attention is invited. Conclusion. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) lar consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditnapparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); (d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and .have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British 'protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of “ British protection ” in this connexion; and, while prima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Government under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit(a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from theResident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall* be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.' As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty’s Government are anxious, however, that— ^ (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as^ unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty's Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit “for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: “Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Kow^eit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No. 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.(^ J. G. LAITHWAITE. India Office, February 6, 1934. ( x ) [Note. —The paragraph referred to runs as follows: — “The 1914 agreement states that in return for the Sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks ‘ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.’ This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word ‘ principality ’ and not ‘ town ’ being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit Sheikhdom on'His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note, that ‘ on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.’ It is true, as pointed out in the note, paragraph 16 (d), that neither the present Sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardlv relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Govern ment’s obligations relieve the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The Sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, in fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the Sheikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns, which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air Force as machine-gunners.’’] 6 t.211!1 5000 8 33 decision/ 1 Minute Paper. political Department. The subject of the relations of H.M.G. with Koweit was discussed with sir Andrew Hyan, the Ministei at Jedda, and Colonel Fowle, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on Thursday, 5th October 1933. The record of the meeting which is very full, and, it is hoped, self-explanatory, is flagged on P.Z.6555. By arrangement, Colonel Powle took back a copy of the record with him on his return to the Persian Gulf on 16th October and discussed it with Lt.Col. Dickson, the Political Agent, Koweit. Colonel Powle‘s reconmendations in the light of his discussion with Colonel Dickson (who is a very experienced officer with long service both in Iraq and injfoweit, and whose relations with the Sheikh of Koweit are close and friendly) will be found in the Resident's despatch No.1365-S of 25th October, on P.Z.7540/33. Sir Andrew Ryan, who saw a copy of that despatch before leaving, expressed general agreement with the views contained in it, subject to the caveat stated in Foreign Office letter of 25th November on P.Z.7683/33, flagged.

The main questions for view of our responsibilities in respect of the fcX (Xk (X* rJXrCCid-i.2. decision now are the following (a) whether it is advisable to declare a British protectorate over Koweit. Alternatively, (b) whether it would not suffice to adopt a policy of tightening up our control over the Sheikh as opportunity offers by filling in the gaps which at present exist in our agreements with him, qnri (c) whether, if so, one of the gaps to be filled should not be that constituted by the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn Saud; (d) the exact extent of the obligations of H.M.G. for the protection of Koweit. 3. As regards the first of these questions - the declaration of a Bri tish protectorate - Colonel Fowle and the India Office representative^ at the meeting at the Foreign Office were inclined to see definite objection,for the reasons stated in the record of the meeting. Colonel Fowle's hesitations have been confirmed as the result of discussion with Colonel Dickson and I submit that in the light of his report (paragraph 3 of his despatch) we may agree tnat the question of a protectorate should not be further pursued at this stage. There are certain very ether definite advantages from our point of view in the establishment of a protectorate (particularly if, as is suggested below, we have already assumed a responsibility for the protection of Koweit as a whol$) But difficult political quest ion s^rise; tde Sheikh would he most reluctant to assent, and the cost would he likely to he very much greater than the advantage. I submit that in these circumstances ana subject to the/the views of the Foreign Office, the idea of a protectorate (which is one which has always found support in the Foreign Office rather than here) should he abandoned. 4. On this assumption, the answer to question (b) in paragraph 2 above would appear to be in the affirmative. There would be much to be said at some later stage, if a convenient opportunity could be found, for placing our relations with Koweit, which are at present based on a series of letters of a rather informal character, on a more regular footing, by means of a formal treaty similar to that vhich was made with the oheikh of ^atar in 1916, ana the possibility of some such general revision of arrangements (possib ly to be accompanied and made palatable to the Sheikh by a slightly more categorical! expression of our willingness to protect,from which &gt;71*.

C* yy h* The question of the direct correspondence which has grown up between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud tro is examined in detail on pages 9 and 13 of the record of the meeting at the Foreign Office, and in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle's despatch now under examination. Of the two alternatives to which the Resident refers we should, I think, on the whole, definitely prefer the first.

Moreover, Colonel Dickson, who speaks with authority, is of opinion that the Sheikh might object more or less strongly to such a procedure. In these circumstances I suggest that the best course would be: the adoption, if the Foreign Office agree, of alternative ( 1 ) in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch, and an approach by Colonel Dickson to the Sheikh on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 , with the modification proposed by Sir Andrew .Ryan and recorded in Foreign Office d.o. letter of 25th ^November, on P.z.7683/33. 6/5.

Laitiiwaits. A ^ ^ ^ ^ 4. ' The question of the obligations of H.M.G. for the protection of Koweit, to which the Resident refers in paras. 7-11 of his despatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B.427/P.Z. &lt;3535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign . Office. The S/3 agrees with the Political Resident that the agreement of 1899 ana 1907, containing as they do merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are e /i ^ not of ^material importance inilthis Li C*VV44 -i**^ connection. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the Sheik in 1914 in return for the cooperation of his predecessor agains the Turks.4 . N * * 4 N * * 4 6/ 5. subject to Sir John Simon's views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Col. Powle's view that the phraseology of this undertaking ana the use of jijp ^ k.(» ° the word tprinoipatlty^ and not '’town* would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole oneikhaoa* of Koweit on H.M.G. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if H.M.G. now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the Sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence and that 'the Sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from H.M.G. in the case of more serious incursions.' Such a construction would, as Colonel Powle, suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by H.M.G. after the Akhwan operations of 1928/29, though it is relevant that no close examination/was^ (Und ertaken at that timey plTthe precise obligations in the natter of H.M.G.’v should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph, Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly.5.

While the 3/3, as stated above, would 'be opposed to tne declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of H.M.G. can he sufficiently secured hy indirect tightening up of our control over the Sheikh, he is at the same time impressed hy the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit* sss£, jj\ This would probably involve a reiteration and by H.M.G. of their responsibility for ' protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the I»0. notefOTTlEis subject, the assurances at present given to the Sheikh are in practice renewed to acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good only so long time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the possibly a more formal specification each successor in return for his as/6. t as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on H.M.G. without correspondingly binding the Gheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by H.M.G. of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous Sheikhs coulu be regarded as bindJng on either party. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as^to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal and that the liability of H.k.G. held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the Sheikh of his obligations under the treaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view it suggested In paragraph 5 abov$, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principality of Koweit as a whole should already be regarded as resting on H.M.G., no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make/Draft Paper. Department. nuke it easier to obtain the consent of the oheikh to a consolidating agreement. The 3/3 would welcome Sir John Simon*s views on this point. 7. subject to the views of the 3/3 for P.A., the 3/3 would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendat ions of the interdepartmental wma-ittso of 5th Octobe^^ the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle Past Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have oeen sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that Committee.

On a cursory reading of that letter, Ryan concurred generally in the proposed instructions, except for the opening clause which states that Ibn Saud intends to reduce Koweit to the same sort of position as Asir. In Ryan’s view it is undesirable to say anything to the Sheikh in the sense of that clause as it might conceivably come to the ears of Ibn Saud, whether through the Sheikh or indirectly, with unfortunate effect on our relations with him.

P.Z. 6555/33, dated the 13th October 1933, enclosing a cony of Jhe record of an Interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on 5th instant, Note by Sir Andrew Byan on Ibn Baud’s attitude towards Tbrwait, and India Office Provi sional hote, dated the 11th October 1933, on the obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait. I discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Kuwait, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. 2. One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs 7 and 8) discus red at the meeting was briefly whether, ~ith a view to maintaining our control over Kuwait, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that Sbaikhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a noli cy of tight ening up our control over the Shaikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agree ments with him. 3. As will be seen from the record, nrima facie 1 favoured (b) rather than (a}, and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Hickson, who agrees with me, has cc nfirmed/ His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, r l‘h e l nd i a Cf f i c e, LOUDON, (V 20 NOV_ o_ cor? firmed me in that opinion. The ohjectioms to (aj are that, in our - (i.e. Colonel Dickson and my^, opinion a protectorate v^ould most probably meet 'with considerable opposition from the Shaikh, who while valuing his British connection values epually highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arab rulers, and the outside world in general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other Shaikhs on the Arab Coast of the Gulf. It might also involve His Majesty's Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Kuwait which can at present be avoided. i*he question of slavery in Kuwait, for example, as part of the Slavery question in the Gulf generally, will doubtless be raised m the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no Slave Agreement with the ^uler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local Political Ap-ent can manumit slaves, the Kuwait aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Kuwait remains ’independent 1 His Majesty’s Government’s responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the Shaikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the Shaikhdom, His Majesty’s Government might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Binall3 r it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Kuwait protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other governments of ’land grabbing’ and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas.■HH 1—| 4, An examination of the alternative polic^r ('bj shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relation ship with the Shaikh may he, (as was pointed out at the meetingJ, we have a certain control over the ^tuler* (see India Office hote - Obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwaiti, and where ouf Agreements show gaps, these can to a large extent he filled up. Thus control of aviation through Kuwait, whether military or civil, would he in the hands of His Majesty’s Government under the proposed Air Agreement (vide correspondence ending with India Office letter Ho.l^.Z.4434/33, dated the 11th August 1933, to the Government of India, foreign and Political Department) with the Shaikh, while the proposed amendment of the Kuwait Order in Council (vide correspond ence ending with Government of India, foreign and Political Department Express letter Ho.^.364-^/33, dated the 21st August 1933, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Kuwait in the hands of the Political Agent. 5. A third ’gap’ is the hahit of direct correspond ence which has grown up between the Shaikh and ihn Saud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. -'he outcone of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows. There would appear t o he two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence. (1) By informing the Shaikh that before despatch ing any official communication to Ihn Saud he should show it to the olitical Agent , and should take similar action with communications received from ihn Saud. This has been the Shaikh’s custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his/-4- his outv;ar&lt;5. correspondence; v;hether he has shov;n all -i-hn Saud^ official letters to Colonel Dickson we do not, of course, know. After the Shaikh had received our communica tion, which would, of course, he tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the -oractice which he already observed, he would not he able to quote officially an.y letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent, if for instance, in order to present his Majesty’s Government with ^ fait accompli on some point agreed upon between ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could* ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and 1 think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence but to treat the matter on general grounds• Dhe above refers, of course, to official corres pondence: nothing we can do will prevent ’private and personal’ letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that the official correspondence between/Shaikh and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Kuwait [ or perhaps the Resident, Persian Gulf;. This is already the procedure in force (at the Shaikhis own request; in regard to the Shaikh’s correspondence with the ’Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Kuwait has with His Majesty’s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly/-5- Particularly needed at the uresent juncture. ^ tide Gonc-i-usicn 1 of the Meet in g) • As against this advantage Colonel Jiick- son is of the opinion that the Shaikh, who regards ihn Baud, in spite of the latter’s treatment of Kuwait, in a somewhat different light to ’Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. 6. Considering all the circumstances 1 would suggest that l he authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the Shaikh verbally on the following lines. That His Majesty’s Government have had it recently brought to their notice that ibn Baud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Kuwait to a position of dependence on him; similar - for instance - to that of Asir; that it is possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him - the Shaikh - and ibn Baud vhich has grown up of late, even though he - the Shaikh - shows the correspondence to the --'olitical Agent, \ has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Baud the fact of Kuwait’s special relations of protection, etc. with His Majesty’s Government; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the ’Iraq Government, i.e. through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives; that in addition an intimation to this effect to ibn Baud would bring sharply to his notice Kuwait’s relations with His Majesty’s Government; and that finally His Majesty’s Government would be glad to learn confidentially and in formally what were his - the Shaikh's - reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon/- 6 - soon as possible, and when the Shaikh’s attitude has bee cm e known I will snake recommendations as to which alternative should be adopted. (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 above;, was the exact extent of His Itajesty’s Government’s obligations to protect the interests of Kuwait* '-he most importan1 of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Of]ice Note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty’s Government’s Agree ments with the Shaikh are three in number: concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the Shaikh and his successors, merely promised M the good offices” of His Majesty’s Government, ‘’whatever that may mean” as hord Landsdowne later remarked. Our construction of this Agree ment appears to have been the convem ent one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, pro tect Kuwait in any particular crisis that arose, the exact- area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. Majesty’s Government that ”the town of Kuwait and its boundaries” belonged to the Shaikh of that day and his successors. This Agreement in no way added,in principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Kuwait, 7 That of January 1899 That of October 1907 X 'hat of -November 1914 The Agreement of 1899, as far as ’protection’ is 9 The Agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His tho ugh/-7- though possibly read with that of 1899 it might increase these responsibilities up to the 'boundaries’* 10. The 1914 Agreement states that in return for the Shaikh’s co-operation against the 'Mrks 'Kuwait shall be recognised as an. independent principality under -British protection”. This, unlike the phraseology of the previous Agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word 'principality’ and not ’town’ being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Kuwait Shaikhdorn on his Majesty’s Coverrment. Personally I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office -Note that 'on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Kuwait and that we are not called upon to protect Kuwait as a whole”. It is true, as pointed out in the hote Ipara graph 16 (d), that neither the present Shaikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this Agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves hs fran our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Government's obligations relieve the Shaikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The Shaikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty's Government in the case of more serious incursions. This in fact v/as presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928 when the Shaikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen ?ord vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and aranunition, and when some of his men received training from the Hoyal Air Force as machine gunners.11 . In conclusion 1 venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government, for the protection of Kuwait, he investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious.

LMTHWAITE suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty^ Government than it had heen at any time since it had hulked so promin ently as the terminus of the Baghdad railway Before the war. This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia* v/hich had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air standpoint as was the Suez Canal, for naval reasons* and secondly owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that countryo So long as Iraq had heen 'under British control, there had heen a natural tendency to give it prior con sideration and the less important question of Koweit had heen kept comparatively in the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence* the position was changed and Kov/eit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically* Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf* and one from which the Gulf could he controlled^ In the event of war we could prohahly safely assume that Kov/eit would he on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value to the use of which* on the assumption in question, no objection could he raised on the ground that we were violating her neutral!ty 0 Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. COLONEL F0\vLE/COLONEL FOWLE suggested that in point of fact it night one day 'be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit* as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route in creased# MR. RENDBL concurred with Mr» Laithwaite s estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country night have to be modified and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful# On the general point at issue, he observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally inde pendent from either the geographical cr the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free comnunication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply v/as not derived from its own territory, but had tc be imported from Iraq. It was for considera tion therefore whether it would in fact be practicable for Kis Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its leighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. COLONEL FOYyLE/4. ' 76 i) COLOi r EL FOV/LE concurred generally in Mr» Rended' s description ox“ the economic position of the Sheikhdom. He pointed out ; hovieverj that Koweit ha'i adv.-ays 'been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrain was the port of Central Arabia* In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vrs of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit's fresa-water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit ever, for Instance, the question of smuggling* MR. SENDEE agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia wore 4 .n a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to j-iiciease, umess of course Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak and oir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Sand could exert. The question therefore was whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had in fact been suggested that it night be more advantageous to convert our present treaty lerarionship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, tut analogy of the Iladramaut, which was now regarded as part o Li.o Aden Protectorate but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than these we had towards Koweit. would not a Protectorate ensure Koweit mere effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the oheikhdon as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf, MR. LAITHWAITB drew attention to three points:- (a)/(a) At present the obligations of His Majesty's Goyemment to Kowelt were represented by their undertaking to grant 'good offices' in respect of Kowelt under the 1899 Agreement, by their premise of 1907 that “the town of 'Kowelt and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us- “Suba, Huler of Kcweit, and to his heirs after him' and their undertaking of 3rd November 1914 that Koweit, in the svent of a victory over -the mrka, would be recognised by us as an independent principality under British protec- tlon. Th«j' were ttea vary general in terms, and, in ac cordance with our boeisI policy on the Arab littoral, which dated frem a period In which it was possible to protect a cm port by action from ihe sma., but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit cur obligations save as regards “good offices' to Koweit town and the Immediately ad joining area. Recent experianc* had, however, shown that in cases of Intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to acme extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to -the suggested establishment of a Protectorate it was necasmry to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, end also what offset the proclama tion of a Protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the (Ailf. it wculrt in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature since both in Bahrain and in Qfitar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouse apprehensions....6. y s apprehensioas and might even cause the local Sheikhs to turn av/ay from His Majesty's Government and consider sub mitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud,, (c) Tile basis of His Majesty's Government's present treaty relationship with Kowoit was uncsvtisfactory. In the first place it did not rest, as n&amp;s the case with Bahrein, Mas cat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of foraial treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century or, as in the c%ae of f on a compre hensive traaty, hut ms bas«d cnly o.i a comparatively brief corrospondaoce exchanged b 2 tween Uic&gt; Sheikhs and His Majesty's Goveizmecut since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still prosumabiy hindlug since Oiey had not been abro^ri^d, entered jute in i*,onn$xlm frith the lease of Bunaer Shw^Ikh in 19GT; 3 con fly thero were cer'bain gaps, o*g. we i&amp;d no 0 ]. a very agreement wl*lh Koweit. It migiit, he suggested, be possible to fill In the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in W&amp;t my n An example was cur recent raqusst to the Blieikh for certain undertakings in regard to air- facilitios in his Bhoiirhdom, one result of which would be to cone strata effective control of such facilities, T/he‘ther military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty's Gov^mmaat. Another instance was *ihQ roc tat proposed omemment of the Koneli Order-in-Council so as to place responsibility for juris diction over non-Mo-slom foreigners in hands of His Maj e-siy 5 s Govsnimente A gradual tighton^g of our control of this c2iarac'ber t particularly if pursued ae a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid tha difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate smd would make it very rri.ich simpler.. CGLCNEL. „ „ 07. COLO IEL LOl'JLE expressed the view that there did not ^eern to he any intermediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the jheikh on the present lines and a full Protectorate, The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling- to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a iorma! protectorate, and prij^. jaci^. he (Colonel lov/le) v/as not much in favour of it 0 He agreed, however, that it woulu be advisable on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being Questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted nosition vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weak ness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficul ties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control o\/er the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Govern ment, to tell tho Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. MB. RENDEL drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovernment by the Ruler of Koweit such as orejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit ws might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis the foreign power concerned, MB. LAITHWAITE said that on this ooint he thought that Bahrain might be regarded as locus claspicus,, He had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last in our view became intolerable we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh 0 ThereOo 'here were obvious arguments^for doing' so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain ^ v pitch it would be most difficult for us to justify a re fusal to allow foreign governments which migkt be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals* e did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a Bheikh who was abusing his positioxi, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Gaud and Koweit. SIR ANDREW RYAN stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty's Government’s position vis-a-vis of Ibn Baud with regard to Koweit. His T pjesty's Government were not strongly placed, when it became necessary to warn Ibn Saud to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintain* ing that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. COLONEL FOWLE pointed out that in fact our treafy engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Lowers from dealing direct with the Sheikh, Ion Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the sheikh and His Hajesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that infart little trouble was likely to he experienced with foreigners in Koweit,so long as it remained a Beduin town ruled by a Beduin Sheikh and not, like Bahrain, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If,however,cil were discovered within the bheikh- dom, it was possible that difficulties night arise.9 0 Ivir?, RENDEL pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly* If Iraq were to adopt an anti* foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there 0 We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit, We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the Sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own centre.] 0 MR, LAITHWAITE agreed and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control t but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declara tion of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrain and of the Trucial Coast and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the Sheikhdom, Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweit.L relations, SIR A-M3RMW HfAM drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand, This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit t and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Baud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh* What was desirable was that we ...10 0 v/e should oe able to tell Ihn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh's interests in any given dispute. IIS, LAITlt.VAITS said that the explanation of the system of direct correspondence between the Sheikh and ion Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since oecome and when we had oaken the view that it was un necessary to take too strict a view of correspondence beoween Sheikh and Sheikh. That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty's Government conducted the foreign relations of Xoweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasize our own special position in Kov/eit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while Iraq was still under British control. He suggested that we might; (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming ^oo far with regard to Kov/eit - a policy which we were in ract now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade, and (b) enforce stricter regula tions on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence COLOHjl.u FOWLS agreed. Such action would show both the^oheikh and Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be nr cl ei our direction. if v/e did not take some such step as this ? we might be in danger of finding ourselves .j-acecl with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the bneikh ana Ibn Saud. He ought, therefore, to write to the ... ■out &gt; o o (zioj 11 . 'the Sheikh in the cerise that we noted that his private correspondenc.e. with Ifcn Baud had assumed an incre as r ng importance end tell him ihat that correcporidence must now cease, MR« RENDEL concurred, A straightforward control of this nature would he easier to maintain and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ihn Saud had recently tried, to detach the Sheikh of Kuweit from his connexion with His Majesty’s Government, SIP. Ao BYAN also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ihn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally ahsoro Koweit and was hound to do sc sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit c The meeting then discussed what point in the corres pondence hetween the Sheikh and Ihn Saud could most suit ably he taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to hath par ties 0 MB. LAITHIVAITE suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ihn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Kov/elt Neutral Zone, this might he an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose what action could he taken if tho United States Government, in dealing with whom His Maj ‘.sty’s Government had consistently emphasized the Sheikh’s independence 3 were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zonc 0 It was, however, agreed that His Majest ;’s Govern^ ment could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant with12 c without our knov/ledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government c At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A 0 RYAN raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia., or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty’s Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question therefore was what real force there was in Ibn Saud’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. COLONEL FOWLE suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinterland, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. COLONEL FOWLE suggested that on his return to the Gulf ...A (znz &amp;*) i ^ .-\Gulf on 16 th October ho should discuss the edtuation T 7ith Colonel Dickson P Politico.l .\gent, Koweit P who had great experience oi the sheIkhdom^ hi the light oi the conversa tions at the present meeting, and should submit a compre hensive report. It was agreed that this course should he adopted, and that in the light oi the resident’s report and oi the conclusions oi the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the I riddle East Official Sub-Committee c The conclusions of the meeting were as follows: (1) That in dealing with Ibn Baud, His Majesty’s Government should incressingly emphasize the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh 0 (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Baud on official matters was to ceaseo (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Govern ment on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Kcweitc (4) That on receipt of the despatch premised by Colonel Powle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub committee 5 to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting* and setting forth the arguments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate.. ..i ■.v. hlii . ~ VA~* • i f ^ ''S ~ ) LaA &gt;&amp; / 27? .iilDIX A. Note b y S ir ^iclrew Ryan « Itn Sand's attitude towards Kowait&lt; 14. I have been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Baud's policy to reduce Kowait to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of asir from 1926 to 1950. This is in the nature of a pure speculation but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty’s Government. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda but he understands very well the implications of the words therein 'who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government”. On the other hand he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh in 1952, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud’s corn idential messenger to the Sheikh early this year and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes into Nejd last February, when Colonel Dickson sunaised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s274 - »6) 15. 3 ajesty' s Gov .raneat should not concern theuselvos with affair's between Sawli Ai’aMa and lie wait.

You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Kail si', '-a another occasion Auu oey, in rather light conversation, ashed me vny we concerned ourselves in miters between his Government and «owoit. 4. rhe personal relations between the two rulers are pcculi.tr. Ibn Gaud grew up at howait and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is saiu •-■y others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that mbarak treated Ibn Baud very badly. - nyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Gaud from enforcing tne embargo on trade but the embargo on trade’ has not destroyed the Sheikh's ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Gauc. iney are '.ireades wfbo' -.s I once wrote and they both ccEioine some real friendship for His majesty’s Govsrnaent and a wealthy tear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, n mio Sheikh of howait wore at all willing to be '-sirized', Ibn Gaud could make the proposalquite attractive on the following linos, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort oi language he could use:- (a) ’’You are not really inlepcndont, i-iy dear fello v . r . -on ’’are under the thurib 01 the .nglish. oney uignt aiaiex you at 'any16. /^^ny moment or even present you to Iraq* If you must 'be ’’dependent on some one, v/liy be dependent on those untrustv/orthy ’’imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly ’’dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow ’’Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia”* (b) ”1 don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that ’’embargo. As things are at present I have co think of my ovm ’’interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily ’’have an understanding, n sort of 'Zollverein' as they s&amp;y: ’’same duties levied in our ports; free competition between ’’yours and mine; free trade over our land border. ■That have ’’the English done about it? Nothing, because they cannot get 'at me. Sois non frere, et je te f ais vivre. . _Sq _is le leur^ ”et je te tue ” &lt;&gt; (c) ”1 should not mop you up of course. You would rule ”your state under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you 'were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of 'yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back* 'Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement 'with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. 'I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such 'a mess that he asked me to in 1950. I did not hit him on the 'head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with 'me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck 'from me' . (d) 'You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. ' '/'hat has England been able or even willing to do for you? 'If I had the right to protect you against tnird parties, you 'would find that I knew how to see you through.' (e) 'Then there's oil. People are after it in iny country 'and in yours and in the Neutral Zone. 'hy not have an agreed 'policypolicy and present a conuiion Iront to the '.'/est« You knov/ what tne a.P.

'Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don't trust him ’and remember that in the long run your best policy would be 'to deal like me direct with American interests, using the 'others to put up the price'. 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud's parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration* They may, however, be worthy ol some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation, except that Ibn Saud continues to shew a marked anxiety to avoid all complications, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments.

By the Agreement of 23rd January 1899 His Majesty’s G-ovemment formally assured the Sheikh ’’of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said Bond”, under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any power or government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government and not to cede, sell, lease, or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the government or subjects of any other power without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. 2, By Article IX of the Secret Agreement of 15th October 19Q7 for the lease of the Bunder shweikh foreshore, the political Agent intimated that he was “duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise and do hereby promise that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh JVbbarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Ivbbarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs etc. aid all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and...” In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs cues in excess of 4% on goods imported or exported by “the subjects of the aforesaid English Government' save with the approval of that Government. 3/4 4 P.2^31/ 02 - 2 - 3. The undertakings given in writing to the sheikh on 3rd November 1914 in return lor his cooperation against the Turks contained an assurance that '‘Koweit shall he recognised as an independent principality under British protection. w B. Construction of the undertakings Riven to the Sheikh . 4. As will he seen, the engagements entered into hy His Majesty’s Government with the Sheikh are in rather general terms and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times hy His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No.45 of 4th December 1901, P.1417/01) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise' (to respect the status quo) 'and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh and will not tolerate an attack hy Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The sheikh should not leave Koweit and should continue to observe his engagement with us'. The assurance given is clearly limited hy the words 'in these circumstances' to this particular case. Moreover, it is not conditional on and is independent of the sheikh’s observance of his Agreement of 1899. 6* On 21st larch 1902 Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a Memorandum on the situation in Koweit remarked that our obligations towards the Sheikh were 'as ill-defined as the boundaries of his Principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection'; on the other hand we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our 'good offices' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking/thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing,and not of Boohyan or other outskirts over which the oheikh has rights of one sort or another...We might it seems to me explain (1) to the Porte (2) to the Sheikh, and (3) to the foreign Powers inmediately interested the objects of our policy. I should he inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district...” 7. Later in 1902 it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s friend, and the Sheikh was v/arned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the sheikh a informed us that Ibn SatKi had with him a gun presented by the Turks and asked for a gift of 2 or 3 guns which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against .2639/02 land attach. The Viceroy (telegram Nb*39 of 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted, 'but that provided he c omplied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of 4th December 1901 (see paragraph 5 above) His Mijesty's Government would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.” The Secretary of State after consultation with the Foreign Office (F*0. letter of 13th October 1902) replied (telegram No.133 of 14th October 1902) 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc , and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government# 3/3 t* G/I.telm. 31.3.11* 3/3 for I. to Viceroy telm. d/- 18.3.11.

The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907 and quoted in paragraph 2 above may be regarded as to some extent corrmitting us in respect of 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 1 . The phrase n its boundaries' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the iirmediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911 and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911, in connection with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. . ^ The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne*s Memorandum of 1902 to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to 'define the region to which* our obligation extends, and 'whether they accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1059 etc;' replied 'We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh’s territory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion...' 10. The Secretary of State for India in the light of the Government of India's views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (P.594/11, 8th April 1911); 'Viscount/r- Vk. — ^ ^ - 5 - ’ 1 W V is count Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of 21st March 1902 is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by His Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India T s telegram of 6 April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extorct. to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol.II pp.1059-1061 of LorimBr^a Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs: that is to say he thinks that in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks . ' - # . or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, H.M.G. could not abstain from using their 'good offices' in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term ’’good offices” is a very vague one, which H.M.G. are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. • It would, however, in His Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions and could not fail to affect our unfavourably^prestige in the Persian Gulf....” P.3489/^ 11. The F.O.replied on 9 May 1911 that Sir E.Grey concurred ”in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh as described in the passage of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.' 12./12. In Aug: 1911 the G-overnrnent of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P.Cox) recommended that H.M.G. should communicate to the Turks a copy of the Agreement of 1899 with a note that H.M.G.had subsequently informed the Sheikh that so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the 1 11 Agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against attack by land or sea.” The Secretary of State for India, on closer consio-eration, found himself unable to accept this proposal, India Office letter to the Foreign Office of 30th October,1911, P.1446/11, remarked: 'The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquis of Crewe’s opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh*s territory as described in Lorimer 1 s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 8th April last, the term n good offices' (which by Colonel Meade’s letter of 23rd January 1899 we undertook to accord to the Sheikh)is a conveniently vague one and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by H.M.G. in 1901/02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. 'His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: 'As regards No.1, H.M.G. have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors/- 7 - i^7 P.G.13, p.75 para.15. P.G.13, p .76 para.18. P.G.13, p.76 para.20. successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, H.M.G. undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,' with perhaps the addition that H.M.G. reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The Foreign Office (F.O.letter dated 1st November 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition and a communication in this sense was made to Tewfik Pasha in Sir Edward Gray's letter of 24th October 1911(42135). 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a v/ho le. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed in March 1916 on his accession by the Viceroy that 'so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim’s conduct was unsatisfactory and it was found necessary to warn him,through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of 3 Nov. 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour and that should acts 'contrary to the interests of (His Majesty's Government' 'unfortunately be committed in future' he would be held personally responsible. 15. In connection with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the ■obligations of H.M.G.for the defence of Koweit was considered innthe India Office, when the view was put forward that 13,p. consideration of our engagements suggested that on a strict 82 para. 40- reading our liability could be confined to the protection- 8 - U&amp;J V -V5’.^ of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. Conclusion. 16. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good oehaviour of the Sheikh; (b) secondly, tfcat subject to this reservation, we are committed to 'good offices' in respect of 'Koweit', an assurance which has since 1911 been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the Sheikhdom, but which would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support; (c) thirdly, *thspt we have promised 'that the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 'belong to ' the heirs of Sheikh Mobarak; (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikhr site was terminated in 1907, the Agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that Agreement should apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. We communicated Article IX of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928: and in 1933 the P.A.Koweit and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to Customs duties(para.2 above) under Article X of the Agreement) (d) fourthly,that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of tne meaning of 'British protection' in this connection; and while prirra facie the Sheikh might apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either bv the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. INDIa OPFICE. 11 Qct.r933. ^ J.G. LAITHV/AITE.question of liability for the protection of Koweit against aggression from outside, 1 9 28/29. (c) The Akhwan Menace. 40. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925,J but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair Iribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the Principality.§ At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on 27th January 1928, | and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again successfully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Govern ment under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit” (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument^), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive, cp. para. 47 below), was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that His Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars.'** On 15th August 1928, the A.O.C., Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air reconnaissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of 22nd August 1928, P.4527/28) w The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory In connection with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly and immediately threatened* Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant/ r2 m grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from the Resident...so far as may he practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a permanent base in Koweit territory.' As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the A.O.C. was authorised on 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. 'H.M.G. are anxious, however, that (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) that the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsibility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the A.O.C. in acting under the authority now given him'. (C.O. telegram to Baghdad, No.306, dated 25th September 1928). 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit 'for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month'(c.O. telegram to Baghdad No.76 dated 23rd February 1929, P.1724/29). 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary,V 3 of military force , the nature and extent of which should he determined hy the A.O.C. Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory (P.2966/29). On the 8th toy 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: 'Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Jheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by for the defence of Koweit territory if this can at all be avoided...It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if....such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur...' (P.3167/29). The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Comnissioner on the 11th toy (P.3424/29). 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928/29 is perhaps best stated in the(India Office letters of 22nd August 1928, p.4527, and 8th toy 1929, P.3167, quoted In paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not, investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally/- 4 - generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No.1365-3 of 25th October 1933, on P.Z.7540/33 flagged. lt~l 3 +rizM COPY Or omcE.

TOWARDS THE SHEIKH OP KQWEIT . By the Agreement of 23rd January 1899 H.M.G. formally assured the Sheikh 'of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said Bond', under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs ana successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any power or government at Kowelt without the previous sanction of the British Govt, and not to cede, sell, lease, or mortgate, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the government or subjects of any other power without the previous consent of H.M.G. 2. By Article IX of the Secret Agreement of 15th October 1907 for the lease of the Bunder Shwelkh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was 'duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise and do hereby promise that the town of Kowelt and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Jtobarak-us-Suba, Buler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Itobarak's arrangements in the matter of customs etc. and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of sheikh tobarak-us- Suba/Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and. In consideration of this promise the Sheikh gave-eertaiB undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4% on goods Imported or exported by 'the subjects of the aforesaic English Govt.' save with the approval of that Government. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on 3 rd Nov.1914 in return for his cooperation against the Turks contained an assurance that 'Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection'. 3. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by H.M.G. with the Sheikh are in rather general terms and the construction placed upon them at various times is important. 4. From 1901 to 1907 H.M.G. were committed merely to 'good offices' in general. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit the Viceroy was informed (secretary of State*s telegram of 4th December 1901) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan*s promise' (to respect the status quo) 'and In these circumstances H.M.G. are prepared to support the Sheikh and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit and should continue to observe his engagements with us.' The reference appears to be to Koweit/Koweit tom and not to Koweit Principality. Apart from this, the assurance given is clearly limited by the words “in these circumstances'* to this particular case* Moreover, it is not conditional on and is independent of the Sheikh's observance of his Agreement of 1899. 5. In 1902 it was reported that Ibn Bash id was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn daud, then the Sheikh of Koweit's friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn 3a,ud had with him a gun presented by the Turks and asked for a gift of 2 or 3 guns which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted,'but that provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of 4th December 1901 (see para.4 above) H.M.G. would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State replied (14th v^ctober 1902) 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance further admits of being readas an assurance ad hoc , and it is relevan that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made hy the secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition In question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh they replied that presumably it had, but that it 'only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn ftashid who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit* (telegram of 6th April 1911, P,594/H)» 6. The undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweik lease andqioted in paragraph 2 above may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of 'the town of Koweit and its boundaries'. The phrase 'its boundaries' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. It may be noted that the payment of the rent for the Bunder Shweikh site was terminated in 1922, but that the Agreement does not appear to have been abrogated, the and that/reciprocal pledges embodied in it so far as they are not affected by other apparently subsequent instruments should therefore/he regarded as still binding. It may be noted in this connection that in 1928 we communicated Article IX of tne Bunder Shweikh lease to Ibn Saud and that in 1933 the sheikh^ obligations under Article X of that lease in the matter of customs (paragraph 2 above) were brought to notice by the Political Agent, Koweit and the Political/political Resident as still subsisting, in connection with tbe negotiations with ibn Saud over the Kowelt blockade. 7. In 1911,in connection with the Anglo-Turklsh negotiations, the yueatlon of our obligations was examined in some detail. The G.of I. had proposed to communicate to the Turks a copy of the Agreement of 1899 and to say that 'H.M. G. had subsequently informed the Sheikh of Kowelt that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, H.M.G. undertake to support them and to protect Kowelt against attack by land or sea.' The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of 30th October 1911, P.1446/11, remarked: 'The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902, on which the G.of I. appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea in the Marquis of Crewe's opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh's territory as described in Warriner's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any spe cifid method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Itorley in this Office letter of 8th April/April last, the term 'good offices* (which by Colonel Meade's letter of 23rd January 1899 we undertook to accord to the ^ieikh) is a conveniently vague one and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by H.M.G. in 1901/02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the port in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. 'His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: *As regards No.L, H.M.G. have Informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, H.M.G. undertake to support them and accord them their good offices.* with perhaps the addition that H.M.G. reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their d1scretion.' The Foreign Office (F.O. letter dated 1st November 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition and a comiiunlcation In this sense was made to Tewfik Pasha in Sir Ldward Gray's letter of 24th October 1911 (42135). 8. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit *shall be recognised as an Independent principality under British protection' may be regarded as imparting a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 9. On the death of Sheikh ivobarak his eldest son was informed in March 1916 on his accession/accession by the Viceroy that *so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir's death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in «&amp;rch 1917. Sheikh Salim's conduct was unsatisfactory and it was found necessary to mm him, through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour and that should acts 'contrary to the Interests of (His Majesty's) Government* 'unfortunately be committed in future* he would be held personally responsible. 10. In connection with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of H.M.G. for the defence of Kowelt was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. Saflcluglop. 11. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above we have consistently taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the atelkh; secondly, that subject to this reservation, we are committed to good offices in/in respect of 'Koweit', which may he regarded as covering the whole territory, hut would not commit us to anything further than diplomatic support* thirdly, that we have promised 'that the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 'belong to' the heirs of Sheikh toobarak; fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and have since in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of 'British protection' in this connection* finally, so far as outside powers are concerned we have coirmunicated to Ibn Baud the undertaking of 1899 to grant good offices, and the more specific undertaking of 1901 in respect of the town of Koweit and its boundaries, while the fact that we regard Koweit as an Independent principality will be evident to him from the terms of the Treaty of Jedda, which speak of our special treaty relations with the Sheikh. But nothing was said in connection with the Treaty of Jedda of the vague undertaking as regards 'protection' given In 1914.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l, £ S95(o U^\. 7th October, 193^ My dear Gilbert, I enclose a draft record.prepared by Ken Johnstone, of our meeting of October 5th on Koweit, Both Andrew Ryan and I have hurriedly read through it, and made a few amendments and additions, but I think there are several points where further amendment or expansion may be needed, so please do not hesitate to suggest alterations, not only in the record of your own remarks, but in any other part of the record. As it is possible that the record may have to be circulated to the Middle East Sub-Committee, it is important perhaps you may also be able to show the draft record to Fowle and obtain his observations on it.

It wa* for consideration therefore whether It would In fact be practicable for His Majeaty’a Government to maintain the independence of Howeit as against Its neighbours, at any rate on the present basits of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty's Government. COLON v . FOWL ; concurred generally in Mr. Rendel's description of the economic position of the hellchdom. He pointed out/Must Koweit had * always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrain was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Kowelt vib-6-via of Iraq, he added that best at* the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling JCowelt's fresh-water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Kowelt over, for instance, the question of Mr.B NLiL agreed that both Iraq and audipressure on Kowelt* This being so, th« riyai ^between them orer Kowelt waa likely to Increase, unless of course *audl Arabia disintegrated* The present position of Koweit betveen these two states was weak and air Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn *aud could exert. The question therefore wa* whether His Majesty's Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had in fact been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for Instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Kowelt. Would not a Protectorate•fctabliHhment of a Protectorate it wa^s 3157 necet \ry to consider what the reaction^ of the sheikh would be» and al&amp;o what effect the proclamation of a Protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf* It would In any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature since both In Bahrain and elwowherevlt would probably rouse apprehensions and might even cause the local heikha to turn away from His Majesty's Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn mud.
