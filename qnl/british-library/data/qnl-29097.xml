I^-King Ali and about Beni Atiya caae. I ha?e considered your ei^gestion that I should ask Amir to agree forthwith to recognise Ibn Saud and to conclude a treaty oi friendship. It is of course certain that he would be moot reluctant to I take any such action particularly at the present time and I should prefes not to make suggestion to him if it is going to be open him to turn it down or pro eras tinatdunduly. I propose therefore not to raise the subject with him unless I hear from you that E«M 0 Government are prepared to use compulsiono I anticipate that nothing short of compulsory measures such as direct threat of deposition would cause Amir to agree at present time to recognise Ibn Saudh Another subject which I should like to raise in my conversation with the Amir is desirability, in ligjht of recent developments, of making a further increase in British personnel of Arab legion. I have recently come to conclusion that a fourth British officer is required and I shall be addressing you by despatch on tins subject. I regard thk f as a particularly favourable time for telling the Amir who will not relish the proposal that a fourth British officer is to be appointed.

Addressed to Trans-Jordan No.?0« Repeated to Jedda No.81. 1. My telegram No.68* Your telegram No.56 and Jedda telegram to Foreign Office No.104. In spite of views expressed in your telegram and by High Commissioner for Iraq (see his telegram 26th June) as to innocueueness of All’s visit to Abdulla, His Majesty’s Government feel some anxiety that visit should be taking; place at present juncture. Bee in this connection my telegram No.62 containing text of very confidential report from Cairo. As to Ali 1 * lack of resources is it safe to assume that he and Abdulla could not raise funds for 3 venture which might ultimately bring them a big return? Or might ^*7 least make attractive promises to possible rebels in regard to their future treatment should territory involved in rebellion at any time change its allegiance? 2. It is for consideration whether anything can be done at this stage to minimise possibility of intrigue and to improve relations between Trans-Jordan and Hejas-Nejd. Under Article 5 of Trans- Jordan Agreement Amir has pledged himself tc be guided by advice of His Majesty’s Government in matters of foreign policy and fact that Trans-Jordan Government are financially dependent upon grant- in-aid from His Majesty’s Government gives hold over Amir. It is realised that pressure on Abdulla will not necessarily have same resultresult as pressure on All and that Abdulla might (if in fact he is disposed to intrigue) shelter himself behind Ali* In any case Abdulla cannot divest himself of responsibility for Ali s s behaviour while in Trans-Jordan* 3* Following suggestion is made for your consideration* You might summon Amir to Jerusalem to discuss political questions or on any other ground which you think suitable* You could then point Hit to him character of his obligations under Trans-Jordan Agreement and hint at his dependence upon His Majesty’s Government in the matter of grant-in«aid. You could draw his attention to suspicions which have been expressed not merely in Hejasi quarters as to his connivance in Ibn Rifada incursion and you could point out that he cannot divest himself of responsibility for Ali ! s behaviour while in Trans-Jordan and that His Majesty's Government would take a serious view of the matter if any grounds for suspicion were to arise in connection with All *3 present visit* If as seems probable Mir protested complete innocence and loyalty you could reply that in these circumstances best way in which Mir could make patent his good faith would be for him to agree forthwith to recognise Ibn Saud by concluding general settlement with him or at least a treaty of friendship* 4. Amir’s previous refusal to recognise Ibn Saud as King of Hejaz«Nejd is understandable. It is however anomalous that while His Majesty’s Government are in normal diplomatic relations with Hejaz~Nejd Amir should continue in despite of his obligation under Article 5 of Trans-Jordan Agreement eo refuse to accord recognition of Ibn Saud* During their visit to London Hejaz-Nejd Mission emphasised Ibn Saud s s keenm&amp;sto conclude with Trans-Jordan treaties Of friendship and extradition on simlar lines to those recently concludedconcluded with Iraq, Ihile there ;ore difficulties in the way of negotiation and operation of extradition treaty it may be possible to make some practical arrangement to cover this ground. In any case a. simple treaty of friendship should present no real difficulty 5. In considering suggestion in paragraph 3 you will no doubt gi s due weight to the position in Trans-Jordan and Palestine and ts possible reaction upon relations of Amir with the mandatory power. Among other things Amir might try tc use his consent to conclusion of a treaty of friendship in order to press far revision of Trans-Jordan Agreement. 6 , Bespaton follows upon details connected with proposed treaty, but if you consider that you can smr aon Abdulla to Jerusalem as suggested this interview would appear to present a convenient opportunity which may not soon recur of raising with him general question of conclusion of a treaty a id should not he delayed for mi' despatch which does not affect main question at issue.With the compliments of the Secretary of the Admiralty. ^ a* tV^W, The Under Secretary of State* MwiraUz/ Eef.No* Your Ref .Wo.

Tou may also mention assistance which British naval authorities in ^ed Sea are endeavouring to render in same direction.

If this interpretation is right, answer is that Kis Majesty’s Government would act just as vigorously in preventing a Transjordan attack against Hejaz-Nejd as in preventing a Hejas-Nejd attack against Transjordan. 5.

Department. 85a We have received since the 26th May a very large quantity of correspondence dealing with an incident arising out of an incursion of certain Hejazi malcontents from SgcedM* across Transjordania into the Northern Hejaz with a view to organising a rebellion in that area against Ibn Saud. The question is of interest to the India Office only in so far as its handling may prejudice relations with Ibn Saud, and it has not been thought necessary to make a submission regarding it hitherto* As, however, it is now beginning to attract some attention in the Press, a brief statement of the position may be of interest* It appears that there are in Syria and elsewhere in a certain number of Hejazi refugees who are anxious to overthrow or to embarrass the existing regime in the Hejaz-Nejd, and in their efforts to achieve this end can hope for sympathy from the Shefirtni family, and more particularly from the Ruler of Transjordan. The Egyptian Government,whose relations with Ibn Saud have not always been of the best, would probably also be not unwilling to talee advantage (without burning their fingers) of any attempt to embarrass the King of the Hejaz. 3^ The history of the actual incident, which is still unsettled, is as follows. On the 14th May the Hejazi Foreign Minister informed the Charged*Affaires at Jeddah that one Ibn Rifada,^as ih^Egypt under instructions fronf~ the Ameer Abdullah of Transjordan, that he was giving fugitives from the Hejaz money to return and instructions to await operations in the Hejaz, that the Ameer would help them with money and troops when necessary, and that there were special parties of Bedouin^Akabia who had been told/ 3000 5 31told to prepare for operations to disturb the peace in the Hejaz. These were serious charges and general in character and Mr.Hope&amp;Lll contented himself with reporting; them and informing the Hejaz Government that, in view of their nature, their yawcf inn-s. could not he accepted mmrntmaewiiMimumm without further investigation. 4 On the 20/21 st May Ihn Rifada,with a force of some 300 to 400 Hejazi, crossed Transjordan territory into the Hejaz. The force appears to have been armed / but it is not yet clear whether they collected their arms in Egypt and crossed the border in small detachments (as seems more probable), subsequently collecting in the Northern Hejaz, or whether they obtained arms in Transjordan and crossed that country as a single force. As Mr.Hope^ill had not, on the date of this event, reported his conversation with the Hejaz Foreign Minister, our position was felt to be rather delicate when on 26th May formal representations were received from the Hejaz Government regarding the incident. The position was not rendered easier by the fact that the Resident in Transjordan received information only on t the same date and that a communique issued on his advice by the Ameer repudiating any connection with the rebel forces was so worded as to constitute an admission that the rebels were in expectation of help from the Ameer ’’for some evil purposes in Hejaz”. Prompt action was taken by the High Commissioner in Transjordan to guard the Transjordan frontier both on the Egyptian and on the Hejazi side. The fullest possible explanations and apologies were made to Ibn Saud who seems satisfied of the bona fides of His Majesty’s Government. Steps were also taken to ascertain', and if so to what extent, whether the Egyptian Government were involved and ooouro that L if/ f' V|!.Wj\(?} Minute Paper. Department. if 'tlisy wsi*© in f*9,ct iii'vol'V’Sd. to do wliat was possit&gt;l© to sggupg that no activ© assistanc© should he given to the rebels from Egypt. Finally, one of sloops in the Bed Sea v/as sent to patrol in the Afefcsr area with a view to impeding, if necessary, any concentration of rebels. While the incident is still unliquidated,and the situation is complicated by the fact that in the last few days a further small detachment of 30 or 40 rebels has succeeded in making its way from Egypt into the Northern Hejaz, the crisis may probably be regarded as having for the moment passed# Ibn Saud has had time to organise counter action against the rebels. The rebels * activities do not seem to have attracted any marked degree of popular support in the Northern Hejaz. The Ameer of Transjordan has been frightened by the active and energetic steps taken by H.M.G.j and the Egyptian Government, the question of whose complicity is discussed below, as is that of the Ameer, have taken pains wholly to dissociate themselves from any anti-Saudi activities. We have the more reason to be thankful that matters have turned out as well as they have, £sE?,had active operations been necessary, very difficult questions might have arisen in into connection with the surrender of future Transjordan. It was decided at an earlier stage that in the event of rebels escaping across the border it would not be desirable to surrender them, but that they should be disarmed, removed from the frontier, and, in the case of the rank and file,returned to the country in which their families were located^ the leaders, if captured, (and every effort would be made to capture them) being detained in custody. 35a 3000 5 31 Two/Two points of interest are the degree of complicity of the Ameer of Transjordan and of the King of Egypt. As regards the first,the circumstantial evidence both frouji secret and other sources certainly strongly points to a degree of interest in,and a close connection with, the activities of Ibn Rifada and his followers, for which it is difficult to account satisfactorily. The hostility of the flteefirini family to Ibn Saud is a byword. The ex-King Ali and the Ameer Abdullah have consistently expressed this hostility even more strongly than and it has never been possible to persuade the Ameer to recognise Ibn Saud as King of the Hejaz. We have a serious responsibility in Transjordan,for the Ameer is our puppet and Transjordan is under our mandate. While ♦ **'•'*- we have ridden the Ameer on a loose rein up to now we could not fescape^^responsibility were our protege to be convicted of having stimulated a rebellion against a friendly country to which we have renewed our protestations of friendship in a marked manner only three c or four weeks ago, in connection with the visit of the heir to the throne to London. ^ As regards the Egyptians, reference is invited to Sir Percy Loraine’s secret telegrams No.67 of 15th June on P.Z.3584/32. It would appear that the initiative came from the ex-King Ali and that the Egyptian Government behaved prudently. Lau^ ^ .

Fuad Bey remarked that it was useless to disguise that there had 'been considerable difficulties between Hejaz-Hejd and Transjordan. The mission was charged by King Abdul Aziz to declare his readiness to make with Transjordan similar arrangements to those recently made with Iraq. x x x x x x In regard to point IV, Transjordan, Sir L.Oliphant said that there was no use disguising the fact that relations on the frontier had given rise to considerable friction, and that in .1930 they were very bad indeed. He did not wish to go into detailsat the moment. It was, however, in his opinion, a very good sign that King Abdul Aziz^iould now have declared his readiness to make with Transjordan similar agreements to those made with Iraq. The matter was not, however, quite plain sailing; as he had already mentioned, Transjordan was not a colony, but a man dated territory , and there were quarters in which difficulties in this matter might arise.

(2) It is perhaps not realised that it is forbidden to carry arms in Sinai. Any Bedouin seen carrying arms is at once arresteda Governor^ control of the peninsula is even sufficiently close to make it impossible for more than three or four unarmed men ait a time to slip across the frontier without permits 0 (3) Our information is as follows:- Ton Rifada has been living in Cairo and Benha 0 About eight months ago he paid a visit to Transjordan. He returned to Cairo about two months ago and recently proceeded unarmed to Akaba having sent ahead some twenty to thirty unarmed How(?eitat) from Egypt proper, He gaveTS 7^ Zo gave them no money but only a few seeks ox rice, Hs was short of money end rumours regarding poynmnuw by him were spread with the idea of encouraging recruitment.

(5) There is no official Transjordanian ngeno in Egypt (see Jedda telegram No,67) and I presume reference is to some private agent oi Abooulxah, (6) The Hizb-Al-Hejazi is supposed to he a social club the president of which is Abdel Hamid A1 Khctio Hejoz agent in Cairo during Hussein’s rule. It is nou known that the society has any direct contact with Sinai but its president is reported to be in contact with Amir Abdullah, It is not a serious institution and seems ill qualified to organise any serious movement (7) Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs Starnes that main point is that Egypt had allowed Ibn Rifadu to organise an expedition in her territory. As Sir A° Ryan in reply pointed out no government can prevent plots being hatched in its capital. Blame lies on organisers outside Egypt, There is as yet no evidence of3. of responsibility of Egypt’s complicity with plotters; crmed trnds could not be orgrnised in Sinai end sent across the frontier without the knowledge of Jervis 0 (8) w ith reference to your telegram no.106 it is unlikely that any Bedouin will return armed (see paragraph 2 of above). Should any do so they will at once be arrested end disarmed in accordance with permanent prohibition against carrying of arms in Sinai, All will be shepherded into their respective tribal areas more than fifty miles from the frontier. Steps have already been t 'ken to prevent supply of foodstuff and arms to rebels. They cannot have received any from Egypt except in insignificant quantities. Our information is that such raiders as came from Egypt were supplied with arms just outside Akaba, 'E' ends, (9) In view of the fact that foregoing information conflicts somewhat with statement made to Kejazi government regarding passage of Ibn Rif ado, and party from Sinai to Hejaz (see first paragraph of communication contained in your telegram no.48 to Jeada) I must leave it to you to decide what if any part of this telegram should be communicated to Hejazi governmentc Addressed to Foreign Office Noe, 70 and 71, repeated to Jedda mid Jerusalem*[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be r etnmed to the Foreign Office if not required for official iisip j) y ^ &lt;95 a- j Prom iD,JAZ-imTii.

Minister for Foreign Affairs sums up under four headings measures described in my note and expresses thanks for the care shown in dealing with action which he repeats has involved hostility to His Majesty’s Government as well as to his Government and which violates Article 2 of Treaty of Jedda besides Hadda Agreement and principles of inter national iaw c He nevertheless considers the promised measures insufficient as rebels are only a few hours’ journey from Akaba and will, if threatened with attack by Government „,.2 Government force^ find it easy to escape if frontier is sot closed* They will have the guarantee of safety and escape penalty of rehellion against Kejazi Government. Aiter developing these considerations further in order to show the need for severity. Minister for Foreign Affairs suggests that difficulties to he overcome hy mutual assistance can only he met hy (a) preventing the rebels from crossing the frontier and expelling them hy force if they enter Transjordan, (h) arresting them on entry and surrendering them or (c) permitting limited pursuit into Transjordan which is authorised hy Hadda Agreement subject to the con sent of the other side 0 Adoption oi these measures or of some of them will help in the solution o± the uixf.iculty, will end criminal activites; and will destroy the hopes of evil doers. Minister for Foreign Affairs reverts to the question of alleged two car-loads of supplies and arms and maxes capical cut of the admission that rebels were able to obtain 25 rifles at Akaba notwithstanding the prohibition of arms traffic in Transjordan 0 He goes on to represenu the importance of investigation and fixation oi respor.is3.oilxby as a means of solving present and future difficulties and discouraging enemies of good relations* He suggests the improbability of a fugitive like Ibn Rif ada having had means of his own to procure one month’s supplies ano. rifles mentioned by the High Commissioner, He asks His Majesty's Government to suggest a method of investigation so that it may be undertaken jointly and couples the request for early reply on this point with an offer to produce all evidence s 0 o3. evidence in the possession of his Government, Minister for Foreign Affairs says the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Transjordan is clear.

Sidky when talking to me yesterday about Hedjaz rebellion spontaneously told me the following stoiy in strictest personal confidence asking me to make no use of it. Early in May Egyptian Consul in Bagdad telegraphed for per mission to come at once to Cairo by air in order to make a very important and secret communication the nature of which was not indicated. He was told that he could just as well send a cypher telegram. He again urged that he must come in person and said it was a message from the ex-King Ali to King Fuad. Permission was again refused as neither King Fuad nor Egyptian Government wished to receive any secret communication from Ali. Consul was told that if there was any concrete message he could send it by post. Ali declined to make any written communication to Consul and latter reported by letter giving gist of message to the effect that there was much discontent and effervescence in Hedjaz, that moment was propitious for wresting its possession from Ibn Saud and that the matter could be put throughthrough successfully If adequate funds were made available. Sibley said that neither the King nor the Egyptian Government had slight est intention of being drawn into any intrigue or adventure of this sort. Ho answer was sent to Ali and Consul's report was merely fi led. Sidicy sumised that, it being a matter of common Icnowledge that King Fuad was not well disposed towards Ibn Saud and that Egypt had not recognized Nejd Hedjaz Kingdom, Ali may oe in. agree ment with other members of Hashimite family, was trading on this in the hope of securing King Fuad’s assistance in this clandestine adventure. He added that then, as now, Egypt regarded herself as being under the ordinary international obligations of a neigh bour to Hedjaz, even though she had not recognized Ibn Saud, and that the King held exactly the same view. I said to Sidicy that I was glad he had told me this - tor ; It was rather important. There was as a matter of fact suggestion in my correspondence incriminating King Fuad. Story might be useful for refuting the suggestion if I was authorized to use it later on. Sldky said he would speak to the King. This morning Sidky has let me know that the King is willing that I should make discreet use of the story and he encloses a copy of telegram of June 9th sent by Egyptian Minister for Foreigr Affairs to the Consul at Bagdad as follows:- 'Your confidential letter May 31st. It is undesirable that either Egypt or her Sovereign should be mixed up in the question which forms the subject of proposal. Make suitable use of these instructions and in future avoid receiving acting as intermediary for any similar message.' This seems to take Xing Fuad out. Since receipt of your various telegrams I have been in lose touch with Egyptian Government who are mklng a searching .nvestigation. Report will be sent me and X hope to be able to telegraph its substance. shortlyx •7120) Wt 18117/2750 10,000(2) 12/31 H &lt;fe S?

I have thought it best to include in my note paragraph 5 of your telegram under reference with slight verbal embroidery only. Before receiving your instructions I had received another urgent communication and had had conversations with Minister for Foreign Affairs. His letter alleges departure from Maan on 51st May or the 1st June of official cars with supplies apparently identical with those already mentioned, and pur chased by Abu Kabarti, of 100 rifles for rebels. Reference is made to visit by Glubb to Ale aba; to departure for Amman with Sheikhs; to belief amongst tribesmen that he is concerned in (?grp.omtd.) and to expectations of two raids towards Tebuk an along the coast. Piemainder is not worth telegraphing. I told Minister for Foreign Affairs that activities ascribed to Glubb were exactly such as might be expected of a frontier officer performing his duties and that if accusations '■ere being insinuated I should prefer them to be made frankly,. ne disclaimed any such intention but suggested that tribesmen -ought Glubb was pleased with turn of events. 4-U U I said thatHigh Conrni^&amp;i 01101 v/cis rnostj 0.,iixiouB 'to coll bJo orG,ij g wltli nojcis auulioi x ux6s ou.u L/iiO/tj latter seemed, to ( 2 r' 0 g omtcl«) everyttiing irom us, VJh.at were they themselves doing to guard frontier end with whom was he to collaborate?

Your Excellency, When in Jerusalem on the 23rd instant I had the honour to inform you that Lieutenant Colonel Peake had, some days previously, received a warning from Sinai that there were rumours of a move of tribes to fight Ibn Saoud; that on the 18th information was received from Ma’ an that a rumour was current that a Shereef from Cairo was offering £2 a head to certain Beduin in Sinai to join against Ibn Saoud and march, via the north of Aqaba, into the Hejaz; that on the 21st it was reported from Ma 1 an that on the night of the 20/21st 300 men had passed north of Aqaba and established themselves, under the leadership of Sheikh Hamid Ibn Rafadah at a place some 7 kilos to the south thereof. 2. As I had certain information which confirmed the possibility of such a movement and as Lieutenant Colonel Peake thought the matter of importance it was arranged that Plying Officer Domvile of the Royal Air Fore© Intelligence Service should go to Aqaba to investigate. 3. On the morning of the 24th the following report, which had been obtained from Flying Officer Domvile by Flight Lieutenant Pendred who had flown from Aqaba, was conveyed to me. Two His Excellency, The Higji Comnissioner for Trans-Jordan, JERUSALEM.m 5 . Two hundred and fifty men, mainly Billi and Taquiqat, were collected at el Sherieh some 7 kilos South of Aqaba. These men were without women or children and had left these with their tents in Sinai and Palestine. They had been entertained on their way through Aqaba by the Mayor and had bought some arms with Egyptian money of which they had an unusual supper in notes. It was said that each of them had been given £2 or £3 by Hamid Ibn Rafadah. As the men passed through Aqaba they informed the Royal Air Force Intelligence Agents that they would await arms and provision which would be sent them by the Amir. Small parties of men, unaccompanied by women or children, were seen moving to join those already collected. On the 19th an Agent of the Amir had telegraphed from Amman to Obeid el Kebriti at Ma f an telling him to buy food and presents and send them by lorry to Aqaba. The car started but broke down on the way (on the 25th it was reported to have arrived in Aqaba on the 24th and to contain £40 worth of provisions). Hamid Ibn Rafadah was reported to have left Aqaba by camel on the 22nd with the intention of taking car from Ma*an to visit the Amir so as to get the promised money from him. 4. On the 25th information was received from the Headquarters, Royal Air Force, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, that Hamid Ibn Rafadah expected to be relieved of his command by the Amir Shaker and Hamid el Wadi (the Amir’s Secretary).5. A search of the telegrams sent from Amman to Ma*an shows no trace of any such telegram as that referred to above being despatched on the 19th. The following telegram, however, was despatched on the 21st from Abdurrahman Madi at Amman to Obeid Kabarati at Ma'an:- H We did not receive a money order the truth will reach you by first opportunity', and the following from the same source to Madi Ma f an on the 23rd. H The question of Aqaba is temporary do not send goods on your account.' 6. I am of opinion that the story about the Amir Shaker and Hamid Pasha el Wadi (vide paragraph 4 above) is without foundation because these two men are much too sensible to engage in such a hair brained scheme and because Shaker was told by Mr. Kirkbride some ten days ago that no attack on Ibn Saoud emanating from Trans-Jordan could be allowed. 7. On the strength of the above I decided that the movement might best be ended if I told the Amir the substance of what is set out in paragraph 3 above, if I pointed out that a rumour which was current here that the Amir was mixed up in the movement must very quickly come to the ear of Ibn Saoud, and if I advised him that the wisest thing for him to do would be to immediately issue orders that suspicious characters were at once tobe removed from the frontier. 8. This I did on the morning of the 26th instant. The Amir denied all connection with the affair, said that if Ibn Rafadah arrived he would kick him out and said he would issue orders to his Government and Lieutenant Colonel Peake as proposed. Immediately after I had left himhim he sent his Secretary to enquire what form his order should take. I suggested the following which he adopted after inserting the words shewn in brackets 'It has come to ray ears (from the British Resident) that a number of tribesmen, without their children and women, have passed through Southern Trans jordan and are assembled south of Aqaba under the leadership of Hamid Ibn Rafadah. It is said that these people expect help from me for some evil purpose in the Hejaz. I order you to cause these people to return to their families in Sinai, Palestine or Trans-Jordan and to prevent the passage through Trans-Jordan of any persons whose movements give cause for suspicion that their intentions are not wholly peaceful.' 9. It is the intention that Lieutenant Colonel Peake should fly to Aqaba on the 27th and take what steps may be necessary and possible to carry this order into effect. If the assistance of Imperial Troops is later deemed to be necessary i will so inform Your Excellency. 10. On the morning of the 26th the following telegram was received from Air Headquarters (Trans-Jordan and Palestine):- 'The following is the latest report received from Aqaba. There are 400 rebels here. Fifty Billi and Tahama tribesmen arrived from Beersheba on Tuesday and joined forces, and on May 24th the rebels sent messengers into the Hejaz to seek support in their revolt.' I have, etc., (Sgd.)

Your Excellency, I have the honour, in continuation of my letter No. 192/Sec oi the 27th May, 1932, to report that Lieutenant-Colonel Peake flew to Aqaba on the 27th instant. 2. On arrival there, he sent a messenger to summon Sheikh Hamid Ibn Rafadah to Aqaba to see him. ^s the Sheikh did not come in another messenger was sent to repeat the order and returned with news that the whole party had moved off southwards. Their strength was some 400 men. 3. It is rumoured that the Egyptian G-ovemment is lending assistance to the movement. 4.

Vu ©fe meeting of the Middle last Sub-Commit tee is arranged for 3 p.m. tomorrow the 9th June to consider the situation which has arisen consequent on the raid under Ibn Rifada from Sinai across Palestine and Trans-Jordania in the .northern Hedjaz with the apparent object of raising a rebellion in that area against Ibn Saud. A summary of the note on the subject presented by the Hedjaz Minister is contained in Foreign Office telegram to Jedda 1st June on P.Z.3|g385/32 (Flagged), while the representations made by the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office will be found in their letter of the 3rd June on the same paper. The observations of the High Commissioner of tSfee Trans-Jordan are contained in his telegram of the 7th June, Ho.43, of which an advance/ copy is immediately below. Mr. Rend£,l^ tells me that the Foreign Office are disposed to suspect the Amir Abdulla of complicity in this raid i and I understand from the Colonial Office that are not disposed to dissent from this view tbrv hov that complicity can be proved. J The matters for consideration tomorrow will be, \ first, the terms of the reply to be sent to Ibn Saud and secondly, the steps to be taken in regard to the surrender of such rebels as may escape into Trans-Jordan territory. If, We are only very remotely concerned (to the extent that a breach with Ibn Saud^more particularly a breach, the responsibility for which could, to some extent, convincingly be laid at our door, is undesirable,)and subject to your agreement I propose merely to follow the course of the discussion. // Much/^ Much must turn on the supplementary infoxmation which may he forthcoming from the other more interested departments. It is most unfortunate that this incident should have occurred immediately after the visit to this country of the Amir Feisal and the reiterated assurances of goodwill and friendship on the pait of H*M*G. extended to him, and it is clearly desirable, more particularly if there proves to be any foundation for the suggestions that Abdu^is not entirely innocent, to do all we can to meet the Hedjaz Government. We are not altogether on sure ground as regards the most difficult point of effecting the surrender of escaped rebels. a tjhz* —-* Prom ’y 1 on page 2 of the telegram f?rom the High Commissioner in Trans-Jordania it will be seen that in the absence of an extradition agreement the surrender of such rebels would be illegal in Palestine and Trans-Jordan Law. On the other hand Ibn Saud may be expected to invoke the precedent of 1929 when we agreed in principle to round up and surrender rebels operating in Northern Nejd who might escape into Iraq territory and tted: we ojsrgfccfc in fact actually surrender Ibn Mashhur (the fact that he managed to escape in Syria when in process of being handed over does not affect the principle)^ C&gt;vW“w\A f But we mi ^it I think, without’ altogether wommi t-ting our^elv-e«^ - 523 ^that the cases are not strictly parallel^and the legal position as described above in Palestine and Trans-Jordania go some way to strengthen our case. If we cannot hand over we can at any rate undertake to intern and keep in custody such rebels as may be apprehended and we can make play with the other steps which are being taken by the Trans-Jordan authorities, though I fear that will hardly console Ibn Saud for our failure to detect and intercept this roboLs Ibn Bifada and his party in the first instance.B 12b Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Un'der Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted : Reference to previous correspondence: n 2 i ^ (* .

In this connexion my Government wish to bring the follow ing to the notice of the British Government; 1. The Beni T Atiya only went into the territories of Trans Jordan because they found that they could plunder and raid in our territories and than seek refuge in Trans-Jordan. The Beduin of Trans-Jordan used to raid oar subjects and take much loot and remain safe from all ■vanishment, until the British Arbi trator came and the result was th t of which the British Govern ment are aware. 2. e do not care inch about the question of the Beni ‘Atiya but what we do care about is peace and security between us and Trans-Jordan. Go if th© British Government - os we believe - are interested in this matter, the line of conduct followed in Trans-Jordan should be changed and its present hostile nature be transformed into a peaceful one. 3. The Government of Trans-Jordan have not only encouraged the Beni 'Atiya Beduin to remove to Trans-Jordan, but by accenting them they have also encouraged them to raid• On the 9th/ . Chargd d'affaires. J1DM91»1i &amp;&amp;&amp; 1 (^pril six cs.xaelia@n raided ohaj* 1 ! ibn duv^oyn abh-biiarari of 1 &amp;i Hsiiz^a iisar TajUo.8.a stud i oo]l awa'y from him 15 camels. The raiders have not yet been fully identi- tied, utiu most of the evidence goes to show that they were Beni V&amp;tiya. On the lath Bha *1 Hijja (April B5th) eight «mardaf« camalmea ( - mounted two and two) raided ptghioh al B'imsh and his Beduin at Hawlaaa and toofc a\¥ay from them some camels, 'but the owners of the camels pursued the raiders with 55 riding camels; we have not yet received information as to the place which they reached. The raiders are moat probably of the Bani 1 Atuya. On receipt of definite information regarding the raiders, I will communicate it to you. 4. My Government protest against these raids and request that the criminals be punished and the loot be returned as soon as possible. 5. From the above the British Government can clearly see the results of the policy which the Government of Trans-Jordan are following. It is to be expected that this state of affairs, if left as It is, will lead to unfortunate results between the two countries; this is not in the interests of the good relatione existing between Hejd and Britain. It is not wise to afford to those who do not care about tlase relations between the two cou tries an opportunity to disturb them, while the two parties interested in the matter stand and do nothing to hasten a settle ment. 6. The matter is not confined to this, for we learn further that Hteid ibn Blft&amp;a al A f w&amp;r has gone to Egypt and settled there on instructions from the Amir 1 Abdullah; that\ ibn Bifada pays to certain fugitive Be chain of our country su s of money, sends them bach to T Aqaba so that they may return to \ \ their homos, and instructs them to wait in order to undertake h op©rationsoperations in those regions. We learn also that the mtt '*Ahdnllah will help them with money and troops when necessary, and that there are special parties of Beduin there at , Afaba to whom sums of money are being given for that purpose and for preparing the way for operations which they intend to take with a view to disturbing the peace in our country* ?• If, as I have already explained to you, the matter was between us and I'rans*Jordan only and the British Government had no concern in the case, we should not care; and if the British Government wo -Id see good to leave the matter between ua and Trans-Jordan we should act and they would act and the matter could soon be settled between us by the Might and Bower of God. If however the British Government cannot abandon their position in Trans-Jordan, we should like to draw their attention to the following suggestions* First* k Decision can be taken regarding the Beni ’atiya, namely whether they belong to our country and should be driven out of Trans-Jordan, or whether they belong to Trans-Jordan and should be driven out of our country.

With highest respects, For Minister for Foreign Affairs, (Signed) YD3UFBBITISH iMOiJnon, JIDDA. May 2End, 1933. Tour Excellency, After CompliBientB, In your note Mo. 7/2/5 of the 8th Muharram (May 14} you have requested me to bring to the notice of my Government 7 items of information and 3 suggestions concerning frontier relations between Trans-Jordan and the He jas/Hejd. I shall of course be happy to do so, but I have the honour to request that Your Excellency will first supply me with fuller infor mation on the following points, without which I fear that it would be difficult if not impossible for His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United kingdom to do justice to the matters which you raise. 2. In the first place, Your Excellency .makes the fol lowing statement: ”the Beni 'Atiya moved into Trana-Jordan only because they could plunder and raid in the Rejaz/Mejd and then seek refuge in Trans - J or dan ,f . is it not true, however, that the habitual grazing area of this tribe ranges from the Kerak and Ma 9 &amp;n districts in the North to Bar al Bamra in the South, and does not the tribe normally spend a part of each year in the northern districts of its dtra? Moreover, is it not true that there has been practically no rain this winter in the southern districts, whereas the northern districts have been more fortunate? Is it not a fact, too, that some of the Huweytat at-Tihama and the Billi have also moved north ward in search of grazing and that a 'art of the Beni ’Atiya themselves have ©scaped the effects of the drought by moving southward out of their dira in search of the grazing beyond Taim&amp;? If, as I h^ve reason to think, these factors are true, is it not more probable that the recent movement of a part of the Beni ’Atiya into Trans-Jordan was both customaryand natural, being essentially a gracing moYe.ment within their dlra, uade somewhat earlier in the year than usual because of the drought in the Northern Hejas? i should like to be in a position, when communicating to them the contents of your note to inform my Government whether the Kojaai Government definitely exclude the probability which I have deduced from the informa- tion at my disposal and whether they wish to maintain that the northern tents of the Beni ^itiya moved only in order to take refuge or to raid with impunity, if they do not exclude the probability that the move was seasonal, then it would seem cor rect to admit it and to entrust to the frontier representatives the task of cooperating for the settlement of any question of loot, which these Beni hitiya may have with them, I understand, however, in this connexion that the Governor of fab&amp;k himself took action for the recovery of each loot end completed his police measures and returned to n^ab&amp;k before the first tents of the Beni ’Atiya crossed the Trans-Jordan frontier* 3* With regard to the second sentence of item 1 of Your Excellency's note, I am. at a loss to understand why you intro duce, at this late stage, the statement that ,T The Beduin of Trans-Jordan used to raid the subjects of the Hejas/Hejd and take much loot and remain safe from all punishment, until th© British Arbitrator came and the result was that of which th© British Government are aware”. It would be open to me to reply if I so wished, that th© Beduin of the Bejas/Hejd used to raid the subjects of Trans-Jordan and take much loot and remain safe from all punishment, even when the investigator appointed by the British Government came, and the result was that of which the Hejazi Government are aware - but I have no intention of carrying over the differences of the oast into the cooperation of the present and future. I should like to be in a -position to inform His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that the HejaziHe jazi Gove rumen t are of the &amp;m* mind and that you therefore wish to withdraw the above-quoted statement. 4. Under item 2 Your Excellency has stated that the present hostile character of the frans-Jordan Governments attitude should be changed* fhis statement assures hostility towards the He jaz/K®jd on the oart of the T*rans-Jordan Govern ment. I therefore have the honour to enquiry upon precisely what evidence, apart from the points raised in the remainder of your note under reply, you base this assumption, which cannot, I fear, fail to displease my Government. 5. Under item 3 of Your Excellency *s note you state that 'the Government of ra ran8-Jordan have not only encouraged the Beni ‘Atiya to remove to Trans-Jordan but by accepting them they have also encouraged them to raid 5 ’. My own informa tion being entirely tq the contrary, I shall be grateful if Your Excellency will inform m , so that I may be in a position to advise my Government, exactly what means and measures are alleged to have been taken by the Trans-Jordan Government to encourage this tribe to begin to move northward, and will also explain in precisely what way the Trans-Jordan Government are held to have encouraged them to raid* This explanation seems to me to be all the more necessary since I stated to you in my note of the 22nd April thmt it was in order to minimise the risk of trouble arising on the frontier th- t the Trans-Jordan authorities took measures to control the Beni ’Atiya as soon as they crossed the frontier and ensured that they all moved Horth of Ma 1 in where, according to the local British authorities they then remained* 6. Ae regards the two raids of the 9th and 19th Bhti*! Hijja (April 15th and 25th ), which you assume on incomplete evidence to have been made by Beni 'Atiya, apparently raiding from cover in Trans- Jordan, I have the honour to enquire whetherwhether r, al Eaizaa near Taim^a fl ( ) aXl $ n al Hawizaa* ( ) are one and the saia© place and identical with that shown on the maps as 'sir Hainan” near Taimi ( which ...tatter lies to the eastward of Bar al Haaira. if so, it would seem that the scene of these raids was in the Southern Be jag and nearly 200 miles from the nearest part of the rn ra.ns- JorJan 1 ro^aticr« May those raids, then, not have heen carried out hy the Beni ’Atlya who moved to the South of fatmt in search of grazing? 7* In so far as item 4 of Your Excellency's note is con cerned, I will bring this protest to the notice of my Grovernment* I presume, however, that this formal procedure through the diplomatic channel will be accompanied by 1 practical co-operation between the frontier representatives, initiated in this instance bp Sheyich 'Abdul 'Aziz ibn 2eyd* I shall he glad to learn whether this presumption is correct# 8. hith regard to item X have no doubt thet His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom will be able to see and judge more clearly of the results of the policy which you see fit to impute to the Trans-Jordan Government, if Your Excellency will be good enough to furnish the additional information for which X ask. 9. Item 6 of pour note raises an entirely new issue, as stated in its present form I fear that it does not admit of very serious investigation. In the belief, however, that my Government will wish it to be properly investigated, X have the honour to request that Your Excellency will furnish the following additional information which at first sight appears essential: who B&amp;mid ibn Rufida al a 1 war is, where he has settled in Egypt, and on what grounds it is supposed that he is acting under instructions from His Highness the Amir Abdullah; the names of any Beduin who are known to have received money from him, what Bams they received,and whether they have yet returned to their homes; on what grounds it is asserted that His Highness the mtr ''will help them with wone y ana troops when necessary”; and what indications exist that there are special parties of Beduin at 'Aqaba who are being suborned with a view to hostile operations in the Hejaz, together with their approximate numbers and their identity lour ixoellenoy will certainly not fail to realise that when a serious charge of this nature it preferred against a friendly neighbour, it can only be investigated on the basis of the .. im or mat ion froia your Go v® rara© n't • 10* fhe thr#e suggestIons contained in the latter part of item 7 of Your Excellency’s note will no doubt be considered in due course by my GoTernment, but in order that there shall be no doubt as to the exact meaning of the first part of item 7, I must enquire whether it is intended to convey the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should abandon the mandated territory of ^rans-Jordan in order that such differences as exist between Trans-Jordan and the Hejaa-N©j&amp; be settled forthwith by force of arms.

I have received information today from a reliable source that from 200 to 400 tribesmen of Billi and other Frontier tribes have passed recently through Akaba from Sinai an riding camels not accompanied by their families and are travelling southwards into the Hejaz. Local reports (especially from Akaba) say that the object of this expedition is to raise the Hejazi tribes to revolt against their King.i.Lilli CfiAIiLi'/iAN said that the meeting had been summoned at the instance of tne i- ; 'oreign Office^ which wished to review the situation m the light of possible developments, ile did not chink it necessary to summarise the papers which had been circulated; but he drew attention to a telegram from SIR A 0 RIAN at Jedda 9 Ho e 69 of the 8 th June, 19oS, (circulated with Paper M.E a (0) 62) reporting in formation received from the Hejaz Nejd Government to the effect that Ibn Rifada had gone to see the Amir Abdullah in Transjordan. The Colonial Office had telegraphed to the High Commissioner for Transjordan to ensure the detention of Ibn Rifada, if he should enter Transjordan. MR* RENDEL stated that the Foreign Office wished to consider the probable action by His Majesty’s Government in vie?f of future developmentso Our hitherto friendly relations with the Hejaz had been confirmed on the occasion of the recent visit of an official mission from the Hejaz Nejd Government, headed by Ibn Saud’s son, to London, and the situation that had arisen placed His Majesty’s Government in a very awkward position. He stated that His Majesty’s Government had a definite obligation under the mandate to control the foreign relations of the Amir Abdullah. Hostile incursions into He.jaz territory from or thro ugh Trans Jordan country had taken place and, in the Foreign Office view, His Majesty’s Government were, to some extent, responsible. The revolt, started by the incursion of Ibn Rifada, might very well bring on a very serious situation and there were reasons to suspect that the Amir Abdullah was, to a certain extent, responsible for this incursion. Should this premise prove correct, the obligation of His Majesty’s Government to remedy the situation and prevent any assistance, open and otherwise, from being gi/on to Ibn Baud’s enemies was all the greater. He noted from SIR AJtTHUR WAUCHOPE’S telegram Ho. 43 of the 7th June2 cinculacea as M,E t (o) 61b thst -i + K J 5 tiiat xt evident that the Amir had some previous Anowledsp n-p rh-n T --p ^ f fo-^ °i a-bn RiPadaVs ineursion Circumstantial evidence in r^nonr- viuonce m possession of the Foreign Office 9 confirmed by renoctc? 4 .-. ^ P-its from authoritative sources 9 indicated an extensive -Poo-^ -1 4 S.idnfean plot against King Ibn Saud GROUP CAPTAIN PEIHSE stated that the Air Ministry had received information on the 7 th June, that, as long ago as 3rd April, considerable intrigue was taking place between the Amir Abdullah and certain other personages ■ They had also received information that Ibn Kifada had visited the Amir at Ammam on the 8 th May and that it was then proposed that the real leader of the revolt against Itn Saud was to be Abdullah’,s cousin, the Amir Shakir. MR. REUDEL considered it was important, in framing the policy to be adopted, to know whether the Amir Abdullah, for whose action we were morally responsible, had connived at the plot or not. THE CHAIRMAN said that he could not accept it as a fact that the Amir was implicated. it must be noted that the raiders had come from Sinai which was in Egyptian territory, d'hey had crossed by night over the narrow strip of Transjordan country near Akaba where it is only some fifteen miles broad, i«e 0 , a two hour journey. A party of raiders could easily do this in such country without Teing detected. As to future action* he suggested that it was impracticable entirely to close to individuals the Transjordan Hejaz frontier which is an arbitrary line through desert and difficult country and he did not think it reasonable to expect the Transjordan Government to do so. Definite action had* in fact* been taken to stop and disarm suspicious persons* vide telegram ho. P.A„ 740 of the 8 th June* 193% from the A.0 o C* Palestine (M.E, (0) 63.) Short of wiring the whole frontier* which was obviouslymore could 'be done impx ac ui^able, i't wo.s nol cleg.r whs-ti than the Transjordan authorities were already attempting to do. He asked if the Foreign Office could suggest any further me enures likely to prove effective and in this connexion, he referred to the nuce-ssity of action hy the Egyptian Government in Sinai. that MR, RENDER saiq/he had noted in SIR ARTHUR WAUCHOPE f S telegram No. 43 of 7th June, 1932, that all possible steps would he oaken to assist the Hejaz authorities, hut that infiltration was still going on. He suggested the possi bility of the Egyptian authorities being asked to block the frontier between Sinai and Transjordan in the vicinity of Akaba. He suggested also that SIR ARTHUR WAUCHOPE should be asked whether he required more forces in order to control the A.kaba area and to indicate what further military action he proposed to take. The Foreign Office could then point out to Ibn Saud that some definite action had been taken. He expressed the opinion that if this movement had been merely an ordinary case of raiding, the measures taken would no doubt have been adequate. Should, however, this raid be the beginning of a widespread movement, further measures sould seem desirable, and he considered it essential to make sure that no precaution was neglected. He had been instructed to suggest that SIR ARTHUR WAUCHOPE should definitely be asked whether he required further troops. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSS considered that the High Commissioner had sufficient forces at his disposal and if he required further military assistance he would certainly ask for it. He said that the High Commissioner had two problemsj one was to stop people going from or through Transjordan into Hejaz, and the other was to4 ~ stop any rebels entering Transjordan from the Hejaz. The High Commissioner evidently proposed to deal with both problems by disarming ail suspected persons. The Air Officer commanding Transjordan and Palestine had been asked to give an appreciation of the situation together with a plan of action both for the control of the Transjordan tribes and for dealing with such rebels as escape to our side of the border from the Hejaz. MR. REKDEL felt that^ in view of our moral res ponsibility, more should be done. He further stated that it would be very useful if the Foreign Office could indicate to Ibn Sand the precise nature of the measures , . , „ . , no as which were being taken,/to establish the good faith of His Maj.esty r s Government and in order to reassure Ibn Saud that any recurrence of such an incursion would be prevented. GROUP CAPTAIN PSIRSE considered that the extent of our obligations could be pointed out to Sir ARTHUR WAITCHORE and that he might be asked to take effective measures to stop any infiltration across the border in either direction. These measures would be indicated in the plan which was expected from the Air Officer Commanding within the next few days. He said that the disarming of Arabs on the frontier and the stopping of food supplies referred to in the Air Officer Commanding's telegram of the 8th June (M*E„ (0) 63) demonstrated that some specific action had been taken MR. LAITEWAITE suggested that His Majesty’s Govern ment had a good reply to Ibn Saud in regard to whau had already happened. The difficulty of preventing inroads5 from Egypt via AkaEa could be pointed out to Ibn Baud and at the same time he should be informed of the measures that we are taking to close this bottle-neck. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSS considered that the High Commissioner should be informed of the opinion of His Majesty’s Government on the question, but that the actual measures to be taken should be left to him. It might also be conveyed to him that it was considered most important that rebels should not be permitted to obtain refuge on Transjordan territory, and that they should be disarmed and removed to some safe place. THE CHAIRMAN made it clear that -the.dis-.. position of troops and police must be left to the High Commissioner and his advisers, w r ho alone could deal with that aspect of the matter. THE CHAIRMAN said that SIR ARTHUR WAUCHOPE had been requested to ensure that Ibn Rifada v^as detained, should he enter Transjordan territory. The question would then arise as to what was to be done with him. MR. RENDEL took the view that Ibn Rifada had been engaged in acts of open rebellion and should be treated as a criminal and not as a political offender. ibn Saud had specifically asked that Ibn Rif.ada should bo handed over. As he felt that His Majesty’s Government were to some extent responsible for not having antici pated this movement and nipped it in, the bud, he thought it might help to remedy the situation vis a vis Ibn Saud if we promised to hand over Ibn Rifada should he fall into our hands. He thought that in converse circumstances we should claim that any such offenduishould be handed over. He did not quite understand paragraph (f) of SIR ARTHUR WAUCHOPE ? S telegram No. 43 of the 7th June to the effect that the surrender of rebels would be illegal. He suggested that further explanation should be called for. At all events he considered it most undesirable that Ibn Rifada, if caught ? should be detained in the hands of the Amir Abdullah who might prove to be, in the Foreign Office view ? a fellow conspirator. MR GRIEVE took the view that our omission to prevent Ibn Rifada from undertaking this raid was no reason for his being handed over if caught. Such a course of action was a matter of principle to be settled according to law or established practice. MR. RENDER- after further discussion, said that he realised the objections to guaranteeing to surrender Ibn Rifada and that he would not press the suggestion^ But he considered that it w r as the duty of His Majesty's Government to ensure that Ibn Rifada and other leaders were effectively detained and not allowed to escape. The question of surrender could thus if necessary be reconsidered in the light of the circumstances preceding the arrest. It could be pointed out to Ibn Saud that we would guarantee to detain the leaders and also to disarm any rank and file Of rebels found in Transjordan. THE CHAIRMAN drew attention to the point made by •the High Commissioner that the onus of preventing the rebels from returning to Transjordan rested on Ibn Saud. At the same time, the Transjordan Government must do what they could to assistMR, WARNER referred to the danger of Akhwan forces overstepping the frontier owing to the difficulty of identifying it. MR. RENEEL said that on a previous occasion, in connection with the operations against the rebels in N.Eo Nejd ? Ibn Saud had sent representatives to act as liaison officers with the British fcr ces guarding the frontier in Iraq. He thought that if a suggestion on these lines could he conveyed to the High Commissioner, co-operation between Transjordan and Hejaz forces in rounding up the rebels would be faci litated. THE CHAIRMAN drew attention to the High Commissioner^ clear statement that Ibn Sand’s troops could not be allowed to enter Transjordan, but he saw no objection to asking the High Commissioner what actual steps he in-., tended to take to implement his proposal to assist the Hejaz authorities, vide paragraph (d) of his telegram No. 45 of the 7th June. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE and MR. WILLIAMS both considered it desirable that Ibn Saud should be told that the presence of his forces on our side of the border could net be tolerated. MR. RENDER said that in view of our moral obliga tions and of our failure to nip the incursion in the bud, it would be very difficult to make a major point of this question in any representation? to Ibn Saud, particularly if we were unable to exclude fugitive rebels.CONCLUSION 1 IT WAS AGREED;- That a telegram should he sent from the Colonial Office to the High Commissioner as in the attached draft (Appendix A,) which was prepared in the light of the discussion which had tauen place. MR* RENDER said that cumulative circumstantial evidence, confirmed by reports from other sources, indicated that the Amir Abdullah was involved in the preparation of this rising. He would suggest that the High Commissioner might be instructed to summon the Amir to Jerusalem and give him a severe warning on the subject. THE CHAIRMAN asked that the Foreign Office should first prepare a memorandum in support of tteir allegation for communication to the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner MR. RENDER suggested that if the Amir Abdullah were now taken to task, or even informed that he was suspected, in certain quarters, of being concerned in this plot, it might prevent him from giving further assistance to the movement. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Colonial Office could not take action unless reasonable evidence were forthcoming. On receipt of the Foreign Office memorandum, the question of asking the High Commissioner to make some communication to the Amir could bo considered CONCLUSION IT WAS AGREED;evidence for their ■ir ? s complicity. ? prepared at prepare a general sett lement . MR c 3RENDEL s ai d said tnat he had 'been instructed to raise the Question of the proposed general settlement between Transjordan and Hejaz-Kejd on the lines reach by the latter country with Iraq. This agreement had cleared up a constant source of friction in that quarter and the conclusion of a similar settlement reached with x ransJordan was in every way desirable. The Amir Abdullah who was known to have designs on northern Hejaz ? was reluctant to tie his hands by any such settlement. He had ? however, formally undertaken, by his Agreement with us-, to be guided by us as regards foreign policy. The present occasion appeared a favourable one to bring pressure to bear on the Amir to induce his acceptance, as a refusal by him v/ould suggest his complicity in the present rising, while he could have no better way of clearing himself of suspicion than by agreeing to negotiations on the lines proposed. THE CHAIRMAN agreed that the present position was unsatisfactory and the Foreign Office suggestion certainly deserved careful consideration. CONC LUSION 3 . IT WAS AGREED:- That the present occasion might be found to afford an opportunity for the conclusion of a general settlement between Transjordan and the Ilejaz-Nejd and that the''Colonial Office would consider this possibility in their reply to the letter they had recently received from the Foreign Office on the subject of such a settlement. ‘w Whitehall Gardens, S.MGl, 9th June, 1932. - 9indication of good faith.

Hejaz Government on May 14th sent long and somewhat ——— m—nn strongly worded reply to my Beni Atiyanoto of April 22nd. Translation went by bag due London 4th June and Jerusalem via Residency, Egypt. Besides dealing with Beni Atiya and asking for agreement with Trans-Jordan similar to that with Irak it asked for explanation of 'arrangement made by Amirate of Trans-Jordan to provoke disturbance in Akaba-Maan area' alleging that Hamid Ibn Rifada A1 Awar was in Egypt under instructions from ,1mir Abdullah, that he was giving fugitives from the Hejazi Beduin money to return and instructions to await operations in the Hejaz, that Amir would help them with money and troops when necessary, and that there were special parties of Beduin at Akaba who had been paid to prepare for operations to disturb the peace in the Hejaz. I replied on May 22nd (copies by same bag) stating that these were serious charges which in present form did not admit of very serious investigation. In belief that His Majesty’s Government would wish them to be properly investigated I had to request further necessary information such as - here I asked a numoer of pertinent questions - since charges o±. this nature couldV 1 f 1 11 3 - 1' 1 only investigated on 'basis of the fullest information from the Hejaz Government. This was followed on May 25th and May 26th by interviews with acting Minister for Foreign Affairs who laid himself out to convince me that Amir was hostile and not to he trusted. He promised more information especially about Awar who was a trouble some refugee of long standing. I should not have telegraphed this but for serious nature of reported|raid and its potential consequences and possible connexion with both Hejasi allegations. I should like to know date of passage of raid through Akaba so that I may give Hejaz Government friendly warning if you agree and if Captain Glubb has not already given it to Ibn 3eyd.

We are accustomed to give British Government warnings of impending risings which they doubt at first but afterwards find to be true.

Policy of His Majesty’s Government towards situation which appears to be developing may have to be urgently considered early next week ? and it is essential that I should be in full possession of your views at earliest possible moment* particularly on following points: (a) Do you consider that there is any justification for allegations of complicity or connivance on part of Amir or leading Transjordan Arabs or for statements .that Ibn Rifada purchased arms in Akaba and obtained money from Transjordan sources(b) Can you supply any information regarding control measures in force ? particularly in Akata district * prior to Rifada incursion which could be effectively quoted to show that reasonable measures were in force to prevent Transjordan territory in this . area being used in connexion with subversive activities against Ibn Saud? (c) Please report fully as to measures taken to prevent assistance being given to possible rebels by persons in Transjordan, since Amir’s order of May 26tho (d) Po you consider that if serious rebellion should develop in Northern Kejaz and rebel Nejazi subjects attempt to escape from Ibn Baud’s forces into or through Transjordan, it would be possible to close frontier against them?

Repeated to Jeddah No. 29, Your No. 41 of 4th June. (a) It is believed that movement has been engineered and financed by Hizb A1 Hijazi whose headquarters are in Cairo, The Amir was probably aware of it but is not believed to have given financial assistance. His proclamation (see my telegram No. 40 of 26th May) can be quoted against allegation of his complicity. Leading Trans Jordan Arabs are not believed to be implicated and concentration which is in Hejaz Territory is composed almost entirely of Hedjazi tribesmen. No money has been obtained from Trans Jordan sources but some 2D rifles are resorted to have been purchased in Ababa, (b) Prior to Rifada concentration there were no special measures in force as no abnormal situauion was anticipated. There is a small police post at Ababa but concentration of Ibn Rifada in Egypt and his passage through Palestine and Trans Jordan were unknown to the Governments of Trans Jordan and Palestine till after he had entered Bejaz Territory. In spite of orders to prevent further Hejazis passing it has not teen poss^ole ^o stop infiltration. (c) The Beni Atiya have been effectively prevented-9- from joining nis movsinGntj and. ^i.to.ns.ntiSGs Iiq'v'g 'boon 'tcikon from other Trans Jordan Sheikhs in southern area(s). (d) I am advised that it is impracticable to close the frontier and suggest that Ton Saud should be informed that onus of preventing escape of his rebels from Kejaz rests with him. All possible steps will however be taken to assist Hejazi authorities. If rebels were to attempt to pass near Akaba they could probably be stopped but if (corrupt?) they move north and/attempt to cross at night it would be difficult to stop thenu (e) The rebels except for possible isolated individuals corrupt have not come from Trans Jordan they have passed through (?) Trans Jordan and Palestine from hgypt picking up Eejaz tribesmen en route. Fugitives returning or entering Trans Jordan will be disarmed and removed from (the) frontiers). (f) ho guarantee for surrender of escaping rebels should he given since under Palestine and Trans Jordan Law(s) in absence of an extradition agreement their surrender would be illegal. If however it is decided to adopt the policy described in your telegram and this I strongly deprecate I do not consider that any kind of guarantee could be given that fugitive rebel leader(s) would be surrendered because it might m practice prove difficult if not impossible to honour any guarantee however limited its terms. (g) The strip(s) of Trans Jordan Territory over which these people pass is very narrow near the coast. Every possible police measure will be taken in Palestine ana Pr&amp;ns Jordan and should still more so be taken in Sinai. Owing to lack of food this year in Hejaz I considerthat food scarcity may go far to check any rebellion,; I am now energetically taking all measures possible to prevent food supplies being sent from Palesti or Trans Jordan to the rebels and I have no doubt that similar measures will be adopted by “Egyptian Government, It is suggested that in any reply sent to Ibn I Saud it should he made quite clear that the presence of his forces in Trans Jordan Y/ill not be tolerated* \(JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJ E'STY r S GOVERNMENT). 1- flj C R B T. 62 .

I sent formal message in prescribed sense to Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs last evening. I had already had two long conversations with him, main points of which were as follows: he said that his government had known of Ibn Rifada’s activities for about ten months. They were connected with a plot having ramifications in Cairo, Bagdad and Amman. Egyptian Consul here (now on leave) had tried to create secret committee to upset Hejaz government and had on his return to Egypt encouraged Ibn Rifada. Others im plicated were Amir of Transjordan and Iraqi representative here, whose secretary was a creature of King Ali and whose efforts to promote success of plot had included insistence on being allowed to reside in Mecca etc. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to secret source of information in Egypt more particularlyevidence of a refugee from Vejh. named Mahmoud Abu Togeyga who had been associated with Ibn Rifada. This man had received twenty pounds from Transjordan agent in Egypt and had gone to Amman but finding out scheme was not properly organised had disclosed facts in letter to the Amir Dhaba dated 30th May 0 The Amir Abdullah had given one thousand pounds to Ibn Rifada* Invading party was said to have included a person said to be an Egyptian or according to others a British officer. Bedouin were reported to be saying that the enterprise had British and Egyptian support. Suspect Egyptian launch had been detained at Y/ejh s The King was satisfied that His Majesty’s Government v/ere not concerned. He had not anticipated danger from country like Transjordan where British officers were stationed. He had now ordered forces from various village settlements to proceed to the frontier area and had sent cars from (? grp.cmtd,) as well as large loads of arms and supplies. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs was notifying these preparations in accordance with Hadda agreement. The King desired advice of His Majesty’s Government in regard to particular incident and as to whether he should regard Egypt, Transjordan and Iraq as enemies or friends, I deprecated hasty conclusion. His Majesty’s Government desired stability in Arabia and would certainly not wish Transjordan territory to be used for purposes hostile to Ibn Baud. All British officials in Transjordan were above suspicion but they could not know every Bedouin movement at moment of its occurrence© I discounted evidence against the Amir and TransjordanGovernment pointing out worthlessness of such (? word) of &amp; man line Abu -LSgeyga. and emphasised immediate action taken by the Amir, Transjordan government could not be accused of breach of international law unless they had been accomplices or so negligent as to have thereby facilitated passage of Ibn Rifada, I described the whole sequence of events since Hejaz note of May 14th and drew familiar moral that incident like this could only be averted by personal collaboration on frontiers. I asked for elucidation of King t s request for advice as regards neighbouring governments whereupon Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he was not accusing governments but persons in the capital e.g» he drew distinction between King Feisal and King Ali„ He asked me to await further conversations before telegraphing. In second conversation acting Minister for Foreign Affairs pressed me for my personal view of position of Egyptian Government and probable attitude of His Majesty’s Government if his government used retaliatory measures to meet breach of international law' involved in toleration of hostile activities. I expressed in ability to answer latter question but said as from my self everything I could think of to dissuade Hejaz Govern ment from ascribing guilty knowledge to Egyptian Government or precipitating rupture over the present incident. He definitely asked whether as there had been violation of Transjordan territory by forces organised in ngypt* His Majesty’s Government would not take Miematter up vvit-li iLgypt-ian GrOYernirL6n't on behalf boish of Transjordan and oi Hejaz Nejd. I promised to put the question but was guarded as to your probable reaction. cle asked me to collaborate in communique designed to prevent distorted rumours. I refused on ground of delay which would be entailed by necessary reference to you. I advised Hejaz Government to prepare their own statement but to confine it to actual facts and not to envenom the situation by controversial attribution of responsibility. He said the King intended to evacuate all tribesmen from area south of Hejaz-Transjordan frontier as a temporary measure of military necessity . I made no comment but criticised as being contrary to Hadaa agreement a decision of which he had spoken earlier to require Atun and (?Ibn) Huweitat to settle definitely on one side or other of the frontier. I understood him to say this was superseded by plan to evacuate whole area provisionally. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs put forward on behalf of King request that (a) Transjordan force should repel any criminals attempting to cross the frontier and should not allow them to approach frontier authorities. He wished to avoid difficulties when his forces approached frontier and danger of their overstepping it in ignorance. (b) His Majesty’s Government should conclude or cause Transjordan to conclude agreement with Hejaz Nejd similar to those between latter and Iraq. I could get no information of magnitude of situation in affected area. According to acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Ibn Rifada is still near frontier and is not getting assistance for which he had hoped from Transjordan. My impression is that his adventure may possibly have misfired but that in any case King is pursuing definite aim as follows.~ 4.(a) to crubii ary movement great or small so mercilessly as to intimidate tribes complete!/. (b) T o impress Amir of Transjordan and others of futility of efforts to upset Ms {c; To use incident as means of pressure on His Majesty 1 s Government to bring about new treaty settlement between him and Transjordan. a. agree that last named question is separate from immediate issue but in present circumstances ary attempt to evade it or treat it as entirely independent will breed suspicion. Diplomatic atmosphere is completely friendly so far. Will you give necessary telegraphic information to Cairo ana Bagdad? I will send them record of above conversation.

It reaffirms 'brigands, guilty of aggression against His Majesty 2 s Government as under tuo headings, viz;~ A. Joint measures to he taken 'by 'both sides and 'by authorities under direction of His Majesty’s Government in Transjordan and B. Investigation regarding responsibility and means of 'bringing it home to instigators. Minister for Foreign Affairs sums up under four headings measures described in my note and expresses thanks for the care shown in dealing with action which he repeats has involved hostility to His Majesty’s Government as well as to nis Government and which violates Article 2 of Treaty of Jedda besides Hadda Agreement and principles of inter national law. He nevertheless considers the promised measures insuffi cient as rebels are only a few hours* journey from Akaba and will, if threatened with attack by Government forco, find it easy to escape if frontier is not closed. They will have the guarantee of safety and escape penalty of rebellion against Hejazi Government. After develop ing these considerations further in order to show the need for severity, Minister for Foreign Affairs suggests that difficulties to be overcome 'by mutual assistance can only be met by /IV u ^ I (a) preventing the rebels from ornq-i n . -lx um crossing the frontier and expelling them by force if they enter Irensinr*xor, n ^ j -Liuci iransjordan, (b) arresting them on entry and surrendering them or ( o \ nn-n-m, + + ^ i • . j , r ° ux Permitting limited pursuit into i. i ails Jordan v/hich is a,uthori°en hrr ^ , uunox i^ca oy Had da agreement subject to the consent of the other side.

He asks His Majesty’s Government to suggest a method of investigation so that it may be undertaken jointly and couples the request for early reply on this point with an offer to produce all evidence in the possession of his Government. Minister for foreign Affairs says the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Transjordan is clear. They would defend it by force against attack. nhat would be their attitude and what steps would they take in converse case of aggression by Transjordan? He asks for a clear answer.

Your Excellency, I have the honour to convey to Your Excellency the following information which has been given to me by uhe Mutessarrif of Ma'an, who ivas in AQaba last Thursday, the 2nd instant. 2. The first party to arrive at Sherieh (7 kilos south of Aqaba) was composed of 100 men under Sheikh Hamid Ibn Rafadah who had corns direct from Suez and had with him some £1500. Almost at the same time 130 men came through from southern Palestine. The concentration was then augmented from day to day by small parties of 5 or 6 coming from Sinai and Palestine, until a few days ago it had increased to some 500- As already reported, the concentration moved south to the neighbourhood of Haikl on the 27th and on last Thursday, the 2nd, was joined by a further body of 300 men who had come from ralestine and had marched by the North of Aqaba. All the above men are Billi and Howaitat el Tihama and none of them have come from tribesmen who have been grazing in Trans-Jordan. A further 2 q 0 of the Jaheina are ready to join between Wejh and Dhaba and part of the force which was concentrated at Haikl has been sent forward to Bada (near. Makna) and to between Dhaba and Tebouk. His Excellency, The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, JERUSALEMoThe supplies oh the garrison at Tebouk, which normally ooire from Dhaba, haye been cut off and it is believed that the garrisons of these two places will lay doym their arms, if called upon to do so, without resistance . rue C-o oernor of Teima, mbdul Kerim, who is a local man and is in opposition to Ibn Saoud, is in agreement with Sheikh Sultan el Paqir of the Aneisa. The belief is held by Ibn hafadah and his men that help will be given in any rising by the Beduin of the femen. Hunger is the immediate incentive and all the Beduin who normally reside in the area from Medina to the North are ready to join in any enterprise the leader of which v/ill feed them. Supplies are arranged by Obeid el Kabareti of Ma'an who has been instructed by his brother Alawi el Kubareti, of Suez, to carry on since funds are available. It is said that only some 500 of those concentrated at Haikl are armed. Sheikh Hamid Ibn Bafadah, though a capable man, is not regarded as of sufficient standing or personality to successfully conduct any combined operation of Beduin tribes.

Mo st c onf i dent i al Silky when talking to me yesterday about Hedjaz rebellion spontaneously told me the following story in strictest personal confidence asking me to make no use of it. Early in May Egyptian Consul in Bagdad telegraphed for permission to come at once to Cairo by air in order to make a very important and secret communication the nature of which was not indicated. He was told that he could just as well send a cypher telegram. He again urged that he must come in peison anu said it was a message from the ex-King Ali to King Fuad. Permission was again refused as neither King Fuad nor Egyptian Government wished to receive ary secret communication from Al-• Consul wa s told that if there was ary concrete message he could send it post. Ali declined to make any written communication to Consul and latter reported by letter giving gist of message to the effect that there was much discontent and effervescence in liedjaz, that moment was propitious for wresting its possesaicn from Ibn Sand and that the matter could be put through successfully if adequate funds were made avaixaDic. SiaJqy- said that neither the King nor the Egyptian Government had slightest intention of being drawn into any intrigue or adventure of this sort. No answer was sent to Ali and Consul r s report was merely oiled. Sidky surmised that, it being a matter of common Knowledge that King Fuad was not well disposed towards Ibn saud and that Egypt had not recognized Nesd Hodjas Kingdom,: ,li may be in agreement with other members of Hashiiaite family, , 7 as trading on this in the hope of securing King Puad T s assistance in this clandestine adventure. He added that then, as now, Egypt regarded herself as being under the orainary international obligations of a neighbour to Hedjaz, even though she had not recognized I bn 3 and, and that the King held exactly the same view. I said to Sidky that I was glad he had told me this story; it was rather important. There was as a matter of fact suggestion in my correspondence incriminating King Huad. otory might be useful for refuting the suggestion if 1 was authorized to use it later on. sidzy said he would speak to the King. This morning Sidky has let me know tlicit the King is willing that I should make discreet use of the story and he encloses a copy of telegram of June 9th sent by Egyptian Minister for foreign .affairs to the Consul at Bagdad as f oIIoy/s : - 'Tour confidential letter May 31st. It is undesirable that either Egypt cr her Sovereign should be mixed up in the question which forms the subject cf proposal. Make suitable use of these instructions and in future avoid receiving or acting as intermediary for any similar message.' Shis seems to take King Euad cut. Bince receipt of your various telegrams X have been in close touch with Egyptian Government who are making a searching invest!gation. e-oort will be sent me and I hope t, o b e *le shortly to telegraph its substance-3 No. 70o and 71 ’'R 1 ' begins. My immediately preceding telegram 0 (1) Egyptian government ? s reply is a epitome of detailed information supplied by Jarvis Bey who was summoned to Cairo, Examination of reports was conducted in close co-operation by frontier districts administration and Residency and I am satis fied that Egyptian government's reply is justified, (2) It is perhaps not realised that it is forbidden to carry arms in Sinai, Any Bedouin seen carrying arms is at once arrested. Governor's control of the peninsula is even sufficiently close to make it impossible for more than three or four unarmed men at a time to slip across the frontier without permits. ( 3 ) Our information is as follow's:- Ibn Rifada has been living in Cairo and Benha. About eight months ago he paid a visit to Transjordan 0 He returned to Cairo about two months ago and recently proceeded unarmed to Axaba having s^nt aheaJ some twenty to thirty unarmed How (?eitat) from a gyp 1 p.coper, he gave them no money but only a few sacks of rice. he was short of money and rumours regarding payments by him were spread with the idea of encouraging recruitment. Erora Sinai , , . o+ , 0 +ln . t r ,n a sib Iv 50 crossed the frontier unarmed direct Jarvis estimates that possiogy ^ rn-i o'-rntion to loin in incursion in the ordinary course ol Bedouin migration but there is a regular passage of unarmed Bedouin even of whole tribes across the frontier for harvest work and grazing and it_4 is impossible to distinguisii between bona fide travellers and would-be raiders* ( 4 ) No evidence is available here of any contract between Hafez Amir and Ibn Rifada* there is no official Transjordanian agent in Egypt (see Jedaa telegram No, 67) and I presume reference is to some private agent of Abdullah, ( 6 ) The Hizb-Al-Hejazi is supposed to be a social club the president of which is Abdel Hamid A1 Khatib Hejaz agent in Cairo during Hussein*s rule, it is not known that the society has any direct contact with Sinai but its president is reported to be in contact with Amir Abdullah, It is not a serious institution and seems ill qualified to organise any serious movement, (T) ; Kejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs states that main point is that Egypt had allowed Ibn Hifada to organise an expedition in her territory. As Sir A, Ryan in reply pointed out no government can prevent plots being hatched in its capital. Blame lies on Organisers outside Egypt, There is as yet no evid enee of responsibility of Egypt's complicity with plotters; armed bands could not be organised in Sinai and sent across the frontier without the knowledge of Jarvis. (8) With reference toyour telegram No, 106 it is un likely that any Bedouin will return armed ( see paragraph 2 of above). Should any do sc they will at once be arrested and disarmed in accordance with permanent prohibition against carrying of arms in Sinai, All will be shepherded into their respective tribal areas more than fifty miles from the frontier. Steps have already been taken to prevent supply of foodstuff and arms to rebels. They cannot have received any from Egypt except in insignificant quantities. Our information is that such raiders as came from Egypt were supplied with arms just outside Akaba.

The area in Trans Jordan and Palestine through which rebels pass on their way from Sinai to liejaz is small and can be covered in two hours at night. The police are cross-examining all natives crossing this area and if their intentions appear dubious, arms are taken from them and they are being turned 'back, PART^ Time of Origin 082C ) Time of Receipt 1056 GMT) 8.6*32. bo far it has been unnecessary to reinforce police with military forces hut we may be required to assist in stopping movement of supplies. Although I think it is impossible to predict accurately the date when Ibn Baud’s forces are likely to come in contact with rebels, in my opinion this will he about a fortnight hence. I attach the utmost importance to Ibn Baud being informed that:- (a) It is his duty and not ours to prevent rebels return to Trans Jordan and (h) that entry of Akhv/an forces into Trans Jordan will not be tolerated under any circumstances. 2, Whitehall Gardens, SoW.l, 9th June, 1932.i THI3 ■UO CP'wBIiT IS TH E PiiOBSnT Y OF HI a BItllJJvJIIC fci EjTY 1 S GO^BKNMEFT ) ‘-Ol EC HE T , M.B.(O) M - EJN-^CL , T^l CO IT NO JMPERIAl TiTi:i?MP TO SUB-COIigjlTBEBI K)H c COHC EBKI 3G TH3 IvlIDBLE EAST .UBSTICWS :s*' HM jiSJGhL^E - mm *7. . ivitiA-i.

While, therefore, I recognise the impossibility of closing the frontier entirely, I feel confident that you will take all possible measures, especially at such danger points as Akaba Pottle-neck to prevent passage of rebels to and from Sinai, and I presume that you are satisfied that forces at your disposal are 03equate for this purpose.

On the morning of the 24th the following report, which had been obtained from Flying Officer Lomviie by Flight Lieutenant penured 'who had flown from Aqaba, was conveyed to me. Two hundred and fifty men, mainly Eiili and Taquiqat, were collected at el Sherieh some 7 kilos South of .qaba. These men were without women or children and had left these with their tents in Sinai and Palestine. They had been entertained on their way through pqaba by the Mayor and had bought some arms with Egyptian Excellency, The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, J j uR tj S.&amp;X jJLu •i ♦ ■ inione;/ oic \ : Y.iiicli triey iiad an unusual suj. ply in nodes.

On dne 25dh information was received from the Headquarters •Royal Air Force, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, that Hamid Ibn Rafadah expected to be relieved of his command by dhe Amir Shaker and Hamid el Wadi (dhe Amir's Secretary). 5. A search of the telegrams send from Amman do Ma ? an shows no trace of any such telegram as dhad referred do above being despatched on dhe 19th. The following telegram, however, was despatched on dhe 21st from Abdurrsliman Msdi ad Amman do Obeid Kabarati ad Ha 1 an .— tn'g did nod receive a money order dhe di udli ’will reach you by first opportunity', and the following from dhe same source do Uadi m'an on dhe 23rd. 'The question of Aqaba is temporary do nod send goods on your account.' i -4- rsSZ-x6. I am of opinion that Shaker and Hamid Pasha el tne story about the Amir V1 d-i- ( v ide paragraph 4 above) is wionout foundation because these two men are much too sensible to engage in such a hair brained scheme and because Shaker was told by Mr, Kirkbride some ten days ago that no attack on I bn S.aoud emanating from Trans jordan could be allowed, 7, On the strength of the above I decided that the movement might best be ended if I told the Amir the substance of what is set out in paragraph 3 aboveif I pointed out that a rumour which ?;as current here that the Amir was mixed up in the movement must very quickly come to the ear of Ibn Saoud, and if I advised him that the wisest thing for him to do would be to immediately issue orders that suspicious characters were at once to be removed from the frontier. 8. This I did on the morning of the 26th instant. The Amir denied all connection with the affair, said that if Ibn Rafadah arrived he would kick him out and said he would issue orders to his Government and Lieutenant Colonel Peake as proposed. Immediately after I had left .^im he sent his Secretary to enquire what form his order should take. I suggested the following which he adopted after inserting the words shewn in brackets:- n It has come to my ears (from the British Resident) that a number of tribesmen, without their children and women, have passed through Southern Trans jordan and are assembled south of Aqaba under the leadership of Hamid Ibn Rafadah. It is said that these people expect heir from me for some evil purpose in the Hejaz. I order you to cause these people to return to their fa mi lbs in Sinai, Palestine or Trans-Jordan and to prevent the passage through Trans-Jordan of any persons whose movements give cause for suspicion that their intentions are note wlio 1 lj p e a o e till , n I ^ intention that Lieutenant Colonel Peake sLouu.d lip uo Aqaba on the 27th and take what steps map be necessary and possible to cany this order into efleet.
