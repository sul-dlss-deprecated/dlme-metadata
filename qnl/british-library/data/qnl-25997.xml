Persian minerals We agree that if suitable mining engineer can be found he should collaborate closely with you and concentrate on those minerals which you indicate should be developed. 2 . The most important mineral from point of view of the war effort likely to be obtained from Persia in reasonable time and significant quantities is coal. We are sending you as saving‘‘am extracts of reports on Persian coal v/hich seem to indicate that the deposits might be turned to valuable account at least to meet requirements of Allied Forces in •Persian Gulf area. 5. Consequently P we suggest the mining engineer should primarily have experience of coal mining. We propose you endeavour to secure suitable man from India where pressure on experienced personnel is at present less than in South Africa. Experts of 'Suitable qualification can ill be spared at presont. 4* Persian metal ores, especially copper, are in general too small, too poor, or too remote to justify expenditure of much labour and material. V/e know of no new information which would lead us to change our views expressed in my telegram No. 1245 Mast Esmid (of 5th May) paragraph 1 and concurred in by your telegram No. 773 Mast Mides.

I received full assistance from -the Officials of the Bombay Government and also from the Iranian Consul in Bombay. The following results have so far been achieved. Firstly, it is necessary to obtain a special export permit for the export of any class of goods and this is obtainable from the Indian Government. Before committing myself to purchasing anything I first applied for the necessary export permits of the Export Control at ^ombay and after endorsing my application this was sent up by them to New Delhi so that the official permit should be issued to me. I am now awaiting this permit, but in order to expedite matters I propose to proceed to Delhi next week. Secondly investigations made by me in the market and amongst various commercial firms in Bombay show that there should be no difficulty in the purchase of goods provided these are obtainable in the market, but generallly speaking prices are very high. Actually I have already purchased the matfor portion of the goods, especially ZAARI (?), and I am now awaiting the permit when I shall take deliveiv and ship the goods. • l /Thirdly, —X / _ / ✓ X Thirdly, spare parts for silk weaving are not .available hut I will do my utmost to find.quantities of carding, shuttles, etc* Needles for knitting stockings are unobtain able because in the whole of India there are no facilities for manufacturing silk stockings owing to the fact that the climate throughout the year is hot and ladies do not use stockings. • 1 * Fourthly, spare parts for jute machinery can only be ^Cdlrtained in Calcutta and I propose to go there myself* In conclusiog I beg to point out that I am over anxious to complete my mission as soon as I can but the formalities take a long time and for this reason it has not been possible to complete any shipments up to the present time. I am hopeful, however, for shipments to be made for the ma;)or portion of the goods by next month and I am confident that _..I shall be able to obtain most of the goods and ship, them* I would mention here that up to the present time a credit of only £10,000 has been opened and that the £1000 which it was arranged should be remitted for the purchase of loaf sugar factory requirements has not yet been received. I request you to make a move in the matter of this remittance immediately because I have already applied for a permit to export, and only the remittance is need to close the matter. *-T_. 'X.

Potential development of these industries and their importance to both local and Middle Eastern industry warrant strenuous efforts to find suitable expert immediately.

It is felt however that the progressive investigation of the majority of the industries by experts will be necessary at an early date. Soap and glycerine is a good example: India are refusing coconut oil, yet South Africa want glycerine.

The arrangements for obtaining the staff originally considered necessary for the survey of Persian industries were entrusted by the Government of India to the U.K. G. C. representative in Bombay who made considerable progress towards obtaining the services of qualified people. These activities were, however, suspended as a result of Tehran telegram No. 5 Encom of 9th February to Bombay. 3. The reason for this was not apparent at the time but as the arrival of I.r. Kinninmonth from Persia was awaited it was agreed that 1urther action should be deferred until after he had reached this countr * In the meantime a telegram No. 2211 of 2lst j..nrch arrived from India saying that in view of .the lack of progress,” their Supply Department were no longer *:s£^^on7(ftv/^ng supplies from Persia for their military requirements. 4. This, of course, does not affect the desirability of increasing Persian production in order that Persia ml ht become more self-supporting and an informal meeting was held here on 22nd April oO aiscuss the question. it will be seen from the minutes below that the lack of progress in Telman previously was due to the desirability of awaiting the appointment of a new Commerce Minister before proceeding further in this matter. As a result of the information ijr. Kinninmonth was able to give us, it was agreed at the meeting that the idea of a general survey should be abandoned but that action might usefully be taken in certain specific instances. 5. The draft of a telegram which has now been sent to Tehran bythe Foreign Office is below. Jhis suggests the examination of the cotton and wool industries by experts and it is proposed to ask the Government of India k; they are still able to supply teclmical men qualified to under take this task, a draft telegram to the authorities in India in this sense is accordingly submitted, iSWc-. oe ^ Mo &gt; &lt;T^ V O- 6. The recommendations of my informal meeting of 22nd April came before the Middle East Supplies Committee for approval on 6th May. After a good^deal of discussion they were approved subject to the following €&amp;*ditions:- (a) The Var Office asked that samples of Persian produced blankets and canned fish should be sent by the U.K.C.C. to the Military Authorities in the Midale East so that they could say whether they came up to their specifications. (b) The Committee recommended that irrespective of the acceptability of Persian blankets to the Army the U.K.C.C. should place an order for them. If the Amy do not want them we will resell them to the Poles either for use with the Polish forces now in Persia or for despatch to the million odd Polish refugees in Russian Turkistan. (c) General Whittarn (who appears to be a civilian General with a roving commission on behalf of the Ministry of Supply and who is about to leave for the Middle East) said that he thought' a good deal of engineering capacity existed in Persia which was not fully used. I pointed out that Mr. Harrison had already inspected a substantial proportion of this and that for the rest the bottleneck in the development of Persian engineering capacity will be the provision of skilled personnel to teach the Persians^ Nevertheless the Committee decided that the Foreign Office should send a telegram to our Legation at Tehran asking them to collect as much information as they could about Persian engineering capacity so that it may be available when General Whittam arrives. I doubt whether anything will come of this. 7, ^ to-c vvetd ocV-V&amp;cAa v^ucX vv&gt;C\&gt;&lt;&gt;lYa*'Cc.

We have discussed with Kinninmonth question of survey of Persian industries and understand that delay has been due to the fact that you advised Kinninmonth not to approach Persian Government until former Minister of Commerce was changed. Our conclusion is that the general purvey originally proposed, is unnecessary but that it would oe useful if experts of managerial status could examine cotton and wool industries with view to increasing quantity and^improving quality of output. Our idea is that cotton products should find market m Persia and we are investigating possibility of further orders for blankets being placed by Army, possibly for the Poles. 5, If experts can be found from India, arrangements for their visit will be discussed by Kinninmonth after his return with the owners of the industries. Meanwhile we feel that it would be useful to obtain Persian Government’s agreement in principle. If you and Middle East Supply Centre see no objection please approach Persian authorities and inform me of result.

Mrs. B.E. Heddy, Ministry of Supply. It.was explained that the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation Representative in Tehran had been authorised in January 1942 to carry out a survey of Persian industrial capacity which had been suggested by the Government of India both for political reasons and in order that such capacity might be fully utilised in our war effort and to reduce Persia's dependence on imported goods. The Government of India had offered to assist in finding experts to carry out the- survey.The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation Representative had reported in February that he had hopes at arranging for the survey to he made through the P Llan Ministry of Comraerce hut that in the meantime technical experts should not he sent to Persia 0 No progress had however heen made and it had not heen clear in London what was holding matters up 0 A telegram from the Government of India received in March indicated that in view of the delay their Supply Department had despaired of getting supplies from Persia to meet Army requirements; Advantage was therefore being taken of Mr, Kininmonth’s presmoov in London to consider what could he done. 2. Mr. Kininmonth explained that Persian industries are largely state-owned and that owing to the ixn-co operative at-titude of the former Persian Minister of Commerce he was advised by the Legation in Tehran to postpone any approach to the Persian Government regarding a survey of Persian industries until after a change of Commerce.Minister had heen effected. This change had now heen brought about and he saw no reason why a survey should not he instituted. 5.

The present high price of sugar should act as an incentive to as big sowing as the available supplies of seed permit and the F.O, considered that Consuls are adequately alive to the desirability of doing what is possible to encourage local authorities to stimulate production. The fact that, for transport reasons, the crop can he grown only in the immediate vicinity of the factories, is a limiting factor on production.

Your Ref Dear Rurnbold, I am sorry to have been so long In offering comments on your draft note of the meeting about the development of Persian Industries. Actually I have only one point to make and that is under Paragraph 9.I doubt very much whether any supply of potassium chlorate from Afghnniotcm is likely to be available in the immediate future for Persia. I understand that the present rate of production is only about 1 ton per month which is barely sufficient for local needs. I think it would be wise to limit our comment to a statement that attempts were being made to obtain potassium chlorate from the United States but It was not quite certain whether these attempts would succeed. I may add that there seems very little prospect indeed of any being made available from here. Yours sincerely. H. A. P.

Dear Rumbold, You will remember that at the meeting held to discuss Persian industries it was decided that a telegram should be sent to the Legation, suggesting that an approach might now be made to the Persian Ministry of Conunerce with a view to having a survey made of the Persian cotton and wool industries. You may by now have seen Tehran telegram No. 526 of uhe 23rd April. (This telegram, though addressed to the Foreign Office, is from Jackson and is intended for the Ministry of War Transport, who will presumably be distributing copies*) In parafirraoh 2 of this telegram Jackson says:- 'It is very desirable that responsibility for exploring local industry and raw material position of Persia should be clearly defined. At present the U.K.C.C. are nominally responsible, but co-ordination is necessary between M.E.S.C., Eastern Group and the army, who are all acting independently at present. I will report further after discussion with G. H. Q. Middle East, 10th Army and Nixon.’ 1 In view of this message, do you agree that it would be better to await Jackson’s further report before saying anything further to Tehran ourselves?

Mr. fi.£.ijB£uen, ministry of j&amp;onoraic Warfare. Mrs. B.B.Heddy, m inistry of Supply. It was explained that the U.K.C.C. Representative in Tehran had been authorised in January 1942 to cany out a ; survey of Persian industrial capacity which had been suggested by the Government of India both for political reasons and in order that such capacity might be fully utilised in our war effort and to reduce Persia's c dependence on imported goods. The Government of India had - offered to assist in finding experts to carry out the survey. The U.K.C.C. Representative had reported in February that he had hopes of arranging for the survey to be made through the Persian Ministry of Commerce but that in the meantime technical experts should not be sent to Persia. No progress had however been made and it had not been clear in lin d en &lt; what was holding matters up. A telegram from the Government of India received in March indicated that in view of the delay their Supply Department had despaired of getting supplies from Persia to meet Army requirements. Advantage was therefore being talcen of Mr . Kininmonth * s presence in London to consider what could be done. 2. Mr. Kininmonth explained that Persian industries are largely state owned and that owing J;o^ the ^non-co-operative attitude of the former Persian ionisiei^lie was advised by the Legation in Tehran to postpone any approach to the Persian c Government regarding a survey of Persian industries until after a change of Commerce Minister had been effected^ This change had now been brought about and he saw no reason why a survey should not be instituted. .V i . ^ C V', •_ V v - V . 3.

This would have to be remedied if increased production was to be expected. - 4. The various industries were then considered individually. ILi. G-I (:i) Canning. The small fish canning industry, which was run by Danes, depended on imported supplies of tinplate for its continued operation. It was suggested that a good case might be made out for supplies of tinplate from the U.S.A. if the canned goods could be used by the Army, thus reducing their need of shipping for food imports. : •■y- -• .© f '&amp; ‘io v» jiv * (ii) 3oao &gt; The manufacture of soap was dependent on the import &gt; of caustic soda. J There was no difficulty about the supply of this from the United Kingdom from 1.0.1, stocks, if shipping space could be made available* It was thought that the cargo space needed could probably be- found. The Persians had also asked for coconut oil, to enable them to produce a better quality soap than they had hitherto produced with local oilseeds, Coconut oil would be necessary if the Persians were to produce glycerine as was at one time hoped, but the price asked by the Persians for glycerine was much higher than the world price. Although coconut oil might possibly be made available from India without affecting the quantities available from India and Ceylon to the Ministry of Food, it was recommended that no supplies should be sent to Persia/ * •)&gt; rJfr foe.. I }*■ ■ yPersia, although if agreement was reached at any time regarding the price of glycerine this could be reconsidered. x -■ . v ■- i-- ■ v i - v o. v c- .' ' Persian reeling capacity is inadequate for the Persian production but reeling could be done in India or Syria although it is not entirely desirable from the aspect to send cocoons to the last named country for reeling. Mr.Kininmonth promised to endeavour to arrange, on his return, for Persian silk ©ocoon production to be increased, for reeling if necessary outside Persia. ^ c-cr ev.:o ao./j. (iv) Cotton. In view of the small proportion of Persian cotton which can at present be absorbed by the Persian cotton industry and the lack of markets for the remainder, there is obvious scope for development of the industry to increase supplies'of textiles to the Persian people and reduce imports. An examination of the industry by an expert of the manager type would be useful for this purpose and it was recommended that pending ilr.KinimaonWs return, the Commercial Secretary at H*M.Legation might be asked to prepare the way for a survey of the industry. It would net be possible to 5 supply machinery from the United Kingdom for the purpose of increasing production but spare parts might be available.' (v) Wool . Owing to the texture of Persian wool, all Persian woollen textiles included a certain amount of cotton. Ibr this reason and owing to their colour they did not come up to the British Amy specifications. They are also more expensive. It is however desirable to encourage the Persian woollen textile industry in order to maintain employment and because the amount of wool which might have to be bought for pre-emptive reasons would thereby be reduced. It was suggested that the Any authorities might be asked to relax their specifications in order that Persian made blankets might be accepted for the use either of our own troops or of the Polish troops or civilians in Persia. An expert of the manager type might be useful in helping the mills to improve the quality of their products. As the woollen textile industry in Persia is privately owned, any approach in this direction could best be made by U.K.C.O., but the Commercial Secretary night usefully mention the matter to the Persian Commerce Minister. (▼i) Jute . The Persian Jute factory is operated most efficiently by a Dundee manager and increased production was impossible in the absence of increased cultivation of raw Jute. No action oan usefully be taken in this direction. Glass. The glass factory has asked for the services of anexpert to assist in the production of window giass rj In view &gt; of the apparent lack of any benefit to the war effort to be ^ deriTed from the development of the glass industzy in Persia it was considered that this matter should not be pursued. w S *i_ - - -C 'O , j. a..—&gt; i x*—/ (viii) Sugar * $he. Persian sugar factories are operated for a few months only each year owing to the shortage of supplies of sugar beet* ‘ Difficulty had been experienced in obtaining supplies of sugar beet seed and any seed which could now be obtained would h . . • ‘ao _ • .. . .. « . _v~ v L-a S.- • - -- ° be too late for the' 19^-2 crop which had to be sown in April. The present high price of sugar should act as an incentive to as big sowings as the available supplies of seed permit and the F.O. considered that Consuls are adequately alive to the desirability of doing what is possible to ezicourage local authorities to stimulate production. The fact' that, for transport reasons, the crop pan be grown only in the iianediate vicinity of the factories,7 is a V limiting factor on production. ! ‘ ~ ^ (^*) etches .

T'he stimulation of local production of civil supplies including raw materials for War industries is clearly within the terms of reference of M.E.3.C,, which has alreadygiven the matter serious attention.

For above reasons, we doubt wisdom of establishing new Board on lines suggested. Please let us know, however, after discussion with M.S.S.C. whether the objective of your memorandum could be facilitat ed by the creation of a new section in M.S.S.C. to deal with local industrial development, and if so, please request M.S.S.C, to indicate to M.W.T. the number and qualifications of additional staff required, and whether local recruitment is possible. appreciate the fact that you may have in mind some body not only encourage local production by persuasion or, as in M.E.P.O., by the placing of orders, but which would be in a finance new production, which M.S.S.C. cannot do under its present terms of reference. We sgggest, however, that the financing of production for which demand is assured can usually be arranged locally in Egypt and Palestine. If this is impracticable and a well supported case can be made out for Treasury assistance, we will take the matter up again here. We think it premature to do so on the strength of your memorandum v\hich does not give us sufficient material from w ic to build up a case.

Approximately 47000 tons were shipped or railed during period 1st December to 28th February or is at Karachi earmarked for the Persian Gulf.

Government of India telegram- No. 15 Saving. i P P P Your telegram No. 472 of 1941 to Spears Mission.- Your sixth paragraph: Persia is normally self- sufficient in maize and barley but cannot export. At present the Persian Government are short of 10,000 tons of barley which the U.K.C.C. are trying to secure. Corporation have also asked London and India for 600 tons sorghum and 300 tons maize for seed, urgently needed for immediate sowing. 2. Sugar beet seed is not l\ormally imported but in view of serious sugar shortage Persian Government need 1,000 tons and also 20 tons so-called ’’mother beet seed” for the year under review. U.K.C.C. have asked London for 250 tens seed for immediate sowing. 3. Rice: normally about 30,000 tons out of a crop of 210,000 tons are exported, but the Russian occunation of the Caspian littoral has involved short collection from cultivators, blocking (possibly confiscation) of stores in the North, and decrease of acreage sown. Exports next season are most unlikely and small imports to South East from India may be necessary. However, Persian Government have permitted formerly prohibited sowing near Isfahan which must be regarded for present purposes as satisfying requirements of the South East. 4. Vftieat remains major problem. Figures which follow are based on estimates supplied by Persian Government and are quite unreliable. Normal peace-time crop about 1,500,000 tons, of which about 300.000 collected by Government for tov/ns and export (about 30,000 tons). Last year's crop about 1,200,000 tons of which about 170,000 collected by Government: 120,000 tons required from us before harvest 1942. Y/e have delivered 36,700 tons up to the end of FebruaryT^^^™ 5. Percentage of decrease of acreage this year unknown but believed to be considerable. Government have offered increased price for wheat in spite of bad political effect of dearer bread and it is therefore possible that the 1942 crop will reach 1941 figures. On the other hand Government will alnKpst certainly not collect more than 150,000 tons for consumption in towns. They estimate import requirements between 1942 and 1943 harvests at 150,000 tons. I agree and would say absolute minimum is 120,000 tons, which would allow for no reserve or possible shortage owing to bad '-harvests.2, 6, Your fourth paragraph* Adulteration is already practised but not scientifically.

We realise that you must have good reason for hesitating in engaging experts for Survey of Persian Industry but in absence of reply to our Encom 307 we do not fully understand the position. 2. Authority has been given by His Majesty's Government for the survey subject only to prior reference to us as to terms on which experts are engaged and it is desirable to press on with the matter quickly. 3. The first essential is to have reliable answers to _ questions in paragraph 4- of Foreign Office telegram No. 17 of 2nd January to Tehran and for this an investigation by our experts seems necessary. Until the sort and quality of goods which Persian industry can produce is known in broad terms, it is difficult to say what purchases can be made. In any case some industries (e.g. cotton textiles) can best be developed to supply civilian market in Persia itself without any purchases by us being necessary although they may need assistance of other kinds. 4-5 Government of India are being asked to send you samples and specifications but you should not await these before submitting your recommendations regarding experts. 5. We contemplate experts should not be engaged for more than a few months at the outset except for industries which you are already satisfied are worth developing and require expert assistance permanently. 6.

In that event we shall write again. t/v Meanwhile wte ^umterstand that a survey of Persian industries by technical experts from India is being arranged through the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and Government of India. I have spoken to Eumbold at the India Office, and he thims.8 that when the Indian technical experts visit Iran, they might well include the Bandar Abbas factory in their tour. They might then be able to say whether a suitable man could be found in India. Rumbold agrees with me that the best plan would probably be to refer the matter to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, at Tehran and asK them to their viewa as soon as possible.

CT^ 1 You may be interested to see these papers# The Government of India suggested in November that a survey should be made of Persian industries with a view to seeing how. . far they could be used for supplying Russia or our own troops in Persia and Iraq, or for meeting the essential needs of Persia's civil population and thus reduce*cthe quantity of goods which must be landed at congested Persian ports. The principal industries in question are:- (a) A woollen factory which is well spoken of. (b) A cotton textile factory which produces only poor quality goods. These would, however, probably be very useful to the Persian civilian population, who, owing to the shortage of cotton goods in the East at present, are likely to be a bit thread-bare. (c) Leather factories at Tabriz and Tehran which we probably cannot survey because the Russians are contracting direct for their production. (d) A cement industry. (e) A soap and glycerine factory which could probably be very useful as the Ministry of Supply have asked the Eastern Group Supply Council to expand Persia's glycerine production to the maximum for supply to South Africa. (f, A match factory. The shortage of matches in the Middle East is likely to be as severe as in this country. (g) A jute factory which has a certain production from locally produced fibre. J (h; A canning industry which is not believed i/u ue mucn use. (i) A copper refinery pfi which Kr. Harrison, who was sent to by the Government of India to look at the armament factories reported/reported well on and in which the Ministry of Supply is interested (j) A silk reeling factory. This may be very important because reeling capacity is a great bottleneck in the production of silk for our military requirements. A survey would incidentally assist us in gauging how much imported raw materials it is necessary to send to these factories (e.g. coconut oil for the soap factory). These requirements must be gauged rather finely owing to the congestion at Persian Gulf ports. •. .t i - » The idea.of a survey was generally approved in all quarters. Terms of reference are included in Foreign Office telegram No. 1? of 2nd January to Tehran. This telegram is based on a draft prepared in this Office.

Note by the Un'.ted Kingdom Commercial Corporation * His Majesty’s Minister in Teheran and the Government of India are in favour of Persian industrial capacity being utilized and developed in order to:- (a) assist in the solution of supply problems; particularly in regard to Russia; (b) conserve shipping space; (c) exert a favourable political effect by reducing local unemployment. The industries in question are Leather, Textiles (Wool and Cotton), Soap and Glycerine, Cement, Canning, War Materials (including Machine-Guns, S.A.A., Bofors Guns, and Aircraft), Glass, Chemicals, Copper, Silk and others as yet unspecified. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation has, pending a decision on general policy, confined itself to sunulying or facilitating the supply of materials required by'certain factories (e.g. tanning extracts and hides for leather factories; chemicals for the soap and glycerine factories; and copper rollers for the cotton mills) and to the nurchase of manufactured goods (e.g. blankets from the woollen mills). At the suggestion of the Indian Government the Corporation has in addition agreed to make a survey of Persian industrial capacity provided the necessary technical staff can be supplied from India. In order to make the best use of Persian factories, assistance beyond the provision of raw materials and the nurchase of output will be required. Germans have hitherto been largely employed as technicians and will nrobably have to be replaced. Capital will no doubt be needed to develop to capacity such industries as are approved. It would appear necessary that a special organization should be created' in Persia to undertake 'the handling of these industrial nroblems. The form, scone and resources of this local organization will be the concern of those charged with the nolitical and military administration of the country. The problems involved (industrial management, the provision of working capital, etc.) are of a nature rri uh which the United Kingdon Commercial Corporation is not equipped to deal; but the Corporation will be glad to assist whatever body is set up in any way it can, and in particular would continue, as it has begun, to endeavour to supply the raw materials that may be needed and to help in the sale of the finished products. If a Board or Committee were created to supervise industrial development in Persia, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation would be ready, if asked, to furnish a member of such Board or Committee,The extent to which His Majesty's Government is prepared to assist in the organization of Persian industrial capacity is a matter for consideration by the interested departments. Both His Majesty's Minister in Teheran and the Indian Government urge a speedy decision, and until this is reached the potential value of Persian resources to the Allied war effort will not be realized. 22nd DECEMBER, 1941 . 2-P j bO^Jzif S' s' [Cyv^r], FROM TEHR AN T O FOREIGN OFFICE .

Survey has not been recommended as the Soviet trade delegation have stated they wish to organise this industry and acquire the output. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have undertaken to supply raw material. As the majority of these factories are in Russian occupied zone it would appear undesirable to interfere in view of the Soviet decision. 4-.

Before a final decision is taken in regard to sending of experts, United Kingdom Commercial Corporation Tehran request that decision should be taken as soon as possible as to the form and nature of technical assistance proposed namely, whether it will be merely a question of supplying machinery and or raw materials . needed for development or whether some form of technical control-^ and management or co-operation is envisaged. Control and management will probably meet great opposition and co-operation could only be assured by financial inducements.

With the Compliments of UNITED KINGDOM COMMERCIAL CORPORATION LTD.H. A. F. Rumbold, Esq. OJ^U. fu -Je^ \ , FHN/SD l6th Decerober, 1941. Dear Fraser, l decision is rather urgently required about r the aevelopaant of Persim industries referred to in • •• Government of In i No. 6^1. I en L&gt; Tarious Eiiebm cables on t i*; subject. X 4 , We feel th?t it is proper for us, as the »m*id- Ox-all-work^, to do all we csu to heln this matter * forward, pending a more general decision, and as you il^ see, we are therefore prepared to supply raw mater ials, to*purchase isanufactured v *oo&amp;5, ^nd to undertake the economic survey requested by the Government of India. But the n ®aid^o.f-all-worJc ,, &gt; should hot attes t , we think, to do the work of the •cmuk*’, .and the General problem of developing the industries of Persia is not we consider, within cur province. A somewhat similar question has .already arisen in occupied enemy terri tories in Afrioa. These cues-ions a re ; to &gt;; l^rre extent, outside th® scope of U.K.C.C., and they asy involve questions that concern othc^r &lt;le 0 ? rtsonts of the Treasury, or even other departments of'H.II. Government . The 'right lin »», a3 it seems to iae, is to avoid the creation or utilisation of any central British Cor ora tion for the handling of these industrial problems'. They are essentially local problems which mst be solved by those responsible for the administration of each terri tory in the light of their resources, possibilities, and NOT ENCLOSED X Arfar umicoin 582 to Tehran ) F.O.

As to the policy, they will no doubt receive guidance from various depart ments of H.M. Government. Thus in Persia it would be desirable, I think, to create straightaway some Persi n Company or Department of the Persi n Admini stration whom ^ouldbe allotted from time to time such funds as may seem justifiable for the development of approved industries. This body oul . have to take responsibility for deciding which industries should be assisted, and for satisfying itself that those indus tries were* ade u&amp;tsly managed. This is particularly important In Persia, where the management, foremen* etc., have probably been largely German in the past. One of the first things that ajjyoae who wishes to develop these industries will have to do, r so it seems to us, is to find adequate managerial and techni cal staff for the factories concerned. &lt; o - i - o 5 1 .5 i&lt; i. We should glint t^ assist where wt could., by supplying rnw materials, and helping in the sale,of the products of the chosen industries. If a Persian Industrie 1 Development Company were created, and we were asked to put/a represantative on the Board, we should be very gled ’to do so, but I do not see that we can go further. ■ - -• .Tv v# o-v The matter is of.^roat interest, not only to our o«n milit ary authorities, and ; ossibly from, the point oi view of suqply&amp;OK • , b iw to the Indian Government, and vihilst Iccan imagine that that Government roiild not wi«h the Persian [odustri/1 Develop ment Company to be overtly connected with India, they might be very glad to h^ve e say in soan.lOf the appoint ments, ida J O-. . 4 •...d f nsiiieT od moon.i xqIpa X nAixieT moil .0.^ nAPileT moil fGQ.ol4 .0 ( flB'ixi&amp;T od ibIiA xiBiiiaT iiioal laoona. iiBifleT moil inoond ns'ideT od qb moonS.If, as I think you will, agree with this general view, you aay feel that steps should be taken fairly urgently. There is a great danger that if nothing else is done, we the only other Government traders on the spot, may be ressed to take more and more action of an industrial character, which we all here are agreed in disliking, and we feel we have already gone quite far enough in undertiking the survey of the industries. sending a copy of this to Rumbold at the India Office, but will leave any further action with you.

Dated New Delhi 01.45 hrs. 6th Dec. 194l. Received 05.15 hrs. 6th Dec. 1941. 6921 Addressed to the Secretary of State for India repeated to Tehran 548. We are still closely interested in the matter of the organisation of Persian industry and the efficient utilisation of its full service to which we referred to in our telegram number 6206 November 7th. Information necessarily Oi ver general nature included in Harrisons report, indicates the existence of small but useful industrial potential particularly in cotton and wool textiles. We understand that Harker of the United Kingdom C.C. is at present engaged in survey of the textiles industry and we note taat the United Kingdom C.C. proposes to place order for 550,000 blankets from the Persian woollen mills. This appears to indicate the acceptance of the non-official principle of our contention that the United Kingdom C.C. in Persia should assume the additional functions of supply organisation. But it appears that there is still much to be done before e.g. General Iraq can be authorised to place demands on* the IT.K. C.C. Tehran for Persian manu factured goods to relieve the strain on Indian production. 2. We have discussed the matter with Stones of E.D. Sassoon and Company who is the technical’ adviser at New Delhi supply department on xiiastern textiles and also has knowledge of woollens and there is little doubt that India could find -Ox the U.K.C.C. in Persia say 2 cotton and 1 woollen tex tile technicians who should be able to assist in bringing existing factories to maximum output and in organising expansion. We could probably arrange also for temporary expert^assistance on the business side if required and in providing the mills stores urgently required.5. We should be glad to be informed with the least possible delay of the decisions reached on the suggestions ''K contained in our telegram nttmber 6206 whether the U.K.C.C. vwish to avail themselves of the offers made in paragraph number 2 above and whether similar assistance in respect of the other industries such as cement and leather is required. We wish to stress once more the importance we attach to this whole question particularly from the angle of conserving shipping space and providing relief however small for the strain on Indian production caused both by the increasing military demands and by the • cessation of Japanese trade. Effect in reducing un employment in Persia should also be valuable.i ;/ ’ | « ( A [CODE] (R) E N C 0 M. FROM TEHRAN TO UNITED KINGDOM COMMERCLYL CORPORATION. Rc Bullard, No. 150 Encon.

Although it appears that Harrison^ survey has been more extensive than was originally proposed, we are inclined to agree with the Government of India s view that a further and more detailed survey might usefully be undertaken as soon as possible, to enable us to make the best use of Persian industrial resources. We understand from Jago that he thinks the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation would be able to undertake this extra task if necessary technical and administrative assistance could be supplied from India. Subject to anything Jago may have to say, I would suggest that our next step should be to ask Sir Reader Bullard for his observations on the Government of India’s telegram. I enclose a tentative draft, which will probably have to be revised or expended in the light of Jago’s comments. I should perhaps mention that a proposal was made a little time ago to appoint an Economic Attach^ to the staff of the Legation at Tehran to take in hand the work now under consideration. This proposal was put to Bullard, who replied that he did not welcome it and that the work was being done already as well as circumstances allowed. I do not /think, H.A.F. Rumbold, Esq.think, however, that he would see any objection to the staff of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation in Persia being reinforced for this purpose. I am sending copies of this letter to Jago and McEuen* \ f^VW*fi 7403/6027/34. Sir R. Bullard, Tehran • Telegram. No Cypher.

I would be grateful for your comments on the question of developing Persian industries. Mr. Harrison, who is a technical adviser to the Eastern Group Supply Council was recently deputed to visit Persia to report on the Bren gun plant owned by Skodas at Tehran. He was also asked to enquire generally regarding other industrial equipment in Persia and his report should be available to the Government of India by now (vide their telegram of 7th November. ^ 1 jjUc fc. 0 Celt The Government of India have suggested that a fuller survey should be made by the U.K.C.C. The Corporation are agreeable but ask that India ‘should provide the men necessary and I think that this is a sound stipulation. The first step however is, I think, to extract some views from H.M. Minister, Tehran with instructions to consult Mr. Kininmonth before he replies. In this connection there appears as yet to have been no reaction from Tehran either to Foreign Office telegram No.910 of 15th October or to Hr. Caroe^ telegram to Mr. Squire No.496 of 13th November. No doubt it is difficult for the Legation to express any views until we know whether the Persian Government are going to accept the treaty. v v -'In telegraphing Tehran I think that we should sound a note of warning with reference to paragraph 3 of the Government of India's telegram No.6206. The congestion at the ports in the Persian Gulf is likely to be terrific. On the present schedule there will be no capacity for the despatch of supplies to Russia through these ports until March if the full requirements of the British Forces in Persia and Iraq and the essential requirements of the civilian populations are to be met at the same time. Consequently it is I think impossible to contemplate developing industries in Persia requiring imported raw materials except insofar as the products of the industries would be essential for supplying Russia,Telephone: Avenue 5011.

Dear Rumbold, Plantation House, (Rood Lane Entrance), Fenchurch Street, 26th November, igfii. • c?- i 21023 ' ! 1941 j Tmrr Please refer to yoiir letter datep November 14, enclosing cooy of telegram 6206 Delhi to the Secretary of State, regarding proposals for the development of certain Persian industries. 2 . We are willing to make ourselves responsible for tbe survey mentioned in naragraph 4 of the telegram; but Kininmonth is already so overburdened with the urgent problems that he is at present handling that even for tbe survey he will almost certainly require extra assistance. In the event of the survey indicating that it will be oossible to make additional use of Persian industries, it is quite certain that his staff will have to be substantially reinforced, although the precise requirements in this respect will not be known until the survey has shown what is possible and the lines of policy have been laid down. 3 . For the extra staff involved we can look only to India, so that our answer at this stage is that, while we are anxious to comply with the Indian Governments wishes in this matter, they will have to supply the men to do the work under the aegis of Kininmonth. This course will probably be agreeable to the Government of India in view of the possibility (mentioned in paragraph 3 of the telegram) of integrating Persian production to that of India; while they would probably prefer a^y men they send to be attached to the U.K.C.C. for the purpose rather than to work openly ^s emissaries of the Indian Government.

We have been considering what contribution India might maize towards the reorganisation of Persian economy and industry. As you are aware Military and Supply Department demands on India's reserves of experts in all technical fields have been extremely (? heavy) and it would be out of the question for us to suggest that we might be in a position to replace Axis technicians in the majority of activities in which they were engaged. Our general view is that apart from aid in the provision of food-stuffs the best prospect of progress lies in energetic pursuit of proposals made in our telegram No. 6206/ 481 of Nov. 7th but at the same time India v/ould be in a position to offer services of one or two irrigation and agricultural experts if Bullard considered their employment in Persia advantageous on a long view. As you knov/, Indian rates of renumeration are high and (? probably) beyond anything that the Persian Government themselves would wish to pay. The question of subsidies to individuals would therefore .o.a.vQ to be laced and this is not one which we should be anxious to raise unless we received strong lead from Tehran. 2.

As regards cotton piece goods, I have told the Indian Trade Commissioner that we will, if necessary, pay India for about £100,000 of goods against rials from the Persian Government as these will be required for road transport. 5 - I am mailing preliminary list of medical supplies required. 4. In addition Persia requires woollen piece-goods, but owing to recent uncertainties I have not continued on previous plan. 5- Now that the exchange question is clarified, the position is simpler. I suggest that you may v/ithout risk purchase from woollen goods exporters enough to make up in quantity their last years export of similar qualities and ship them to Irano-British Trading Company^immediately.

T he leather factory . I understand that a reply (v/hich I have not seen) has been received from Moscow saying that the Russians are proposing to buy up the stocks of semi-manufactured goods now held by this factory and-to place further orders. Clearly, therefore, it is desirable for us to keep the factory supplied with raw materials. The quantity of hides asked'for from India is big as compared with past exports, but there will be no dilticulty in providing them. The demands for tanning materials are so big as to suggest that they are incorrectly quoted. In any case. Quebracho is not produced in India.

VK. f k/~% a _ »JHides Exports of raw hides from India to Persia during the last 3 pre-war years averaged 135 tons and during this period buffalo hides averaged 118 tons of the whole. Exports of raw hides rose to 246 tons in 1939-40 and 295^ tons were licensed during 1940-41. In June the Government of India were asked to restrict exports to normal and it was afterwards suggested that exports should be kept roughly to 25 tons a quarter (which was the proposed ration). No tanned hides are normally exported from India to Persia. Raw buffalo hides average about 93 to the ton so that the figure of 50,000 hides mentioned in Tehran telegram No.902 could be expressed otherwise as about 540 tons. Tanning materials . It is understood from the M.E.W. that, having regard to the quantities of other commodities mentioned, some doubt is felt regarding the figure of 1,500 tons of quebracho mentioned. It is possible that 1,500 tons of myrobolans extract is intended. There are no Indian statistics available regarding exports of myrobolans to Persia. Persian statistics show exports of 161, 46 and 52 tons respectively during the three years ending 1939-40. It has been suggested that exports from India should be restricted roughly to 12 tons a quarter (based on the proposed ration). Glycerine and soap factory . No exports of oil seeds are normally made from India to Persia. Exports of vegetable oils during the three pre-war years averaged 7 tons. 46 tons were hov/ever exported to Persia during the year 1939/40. On the recommendation of E.M. Minister Tehran, the Government of India were asked in April last to refuse export licences for Persia for cocoanut oil and all other kinds of vegetable oils. This ban is still effective. The Government of India have, however, apparently been making enquiries regarding the possibility of obtaining supplies of glycerine from Persia. It has been hinted to them that if they attach considerable importance to supplies from this source the ban on cocoanut oil might be modified. In connection with the activities of the glycerine and soap factory (and incidentally of the suger, glass and wool factories), supplies of soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and caustic soda are necessary. Normal imports of these commodities are 623 tons, 371 tons and 110 tons a year respectively but none is normally imported from India. In June the Government of India reported that large exports of soda ash and sodium bicarbonate from India to Persia had been noticed/noticed by them. The M.E.W. have however reported that these latter substances are relatively harmless as they cannot be used for soap production with a glycerine residue. In connection with an application by I.C.I. to export 795 tons of caustic soda and 90 tons soda ash from the U.K. to Persia, the Government of India have been asked to state (a) v/hether supplies could be made available from India and (b) whether they attach importance to the supply of glycerine from Persia. No reply has yet been received. It is understood however that supplies of all of i the three sodium compounds referred to above have to be \ imported into India from the United Kingdom and it is somewhat remarkable that the Government of India have been permitting 'large' re-exports to Persia. Supplies to India from the United Kingdom are now being rationed. The Government of India have asked that the proposed rations for caustic soda and sodium bicarbonate should be increased. They are apparently satisfied with the soda ash ration; this may be due to the fact that there is some indigenous production.allotted to i3 a &amp; QoDepartments - - I -f-- - - r - - I I - [ • - u 1 VI - ,DEGYPHER T E L SGR A M, rrora Government of India^ External Affairs to Baghdad and repeated by the former to Secretary of State for India* Dated Simla, 20^50 hours, 9th October, 1941, Received 2.%16 hours, 9th October, 1941, XXX 5565 B Addressed to Baghdad repeated to Secretary of State and Tehran Telegram No,409 7 It is proposed to depute Harrison Munitions Adviser Eastern Group Supply Council to inspect Rifle Factory in Iraq, and Penang factories in Persia with view to reporting on best methods of operating them so that their capacity can be used to fullest advantage for (l) satisfaction of needs of forces (? operating) in Iraq, and Persia and ( 2 ) subject to (l) provision of components needed for supplementing production in India* He will be required to (? report) in consultation with Embassy at Baghdad and Legation at Tehran what arrangements are (? possible) and necessary to give effect to his r e commanda 11 ons» 2a Harrison and assistant will leave Karachi air (corrupt group) October Grateful if such facilities as he' may require can be arranged* lv, m[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be kept [Cypher]. under Lock and Key.] MERAL DISTRIBUTION .

In addition to leather factories mentioned in my telegram under reference, textiles, glycerine, soao, canning, machine-gun, aircraft ana other \ factories might be developer topfull capacity, thereby A saving valuable shipping space, Owing to the inability of local Russian representatives to take any decisions without reference to Moscow,it would be of the greatest value if a member of Lord Beaverbrook*s Mission ana a^corresponding Russian official with full power could visit Persia to explore these possibilities. Development of the existing industries on these lines would not only assist our immediate war effort but would give profitable employment to the local population and thereby create conditions of prosperity ana stability before the coming winter which should go a long way to counteracting the present disruptive tendencies. •[Code rf].
