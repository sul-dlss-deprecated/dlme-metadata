I. 13th February, 1946. Dear Donaldson, With reference to the enclosed copy of Hay’s letter dated the 26th January, 1948, I see no objection to the Foreign Office paying the staff from March, 1948 inclusive instead of from April, 1948 and, subject to any observations you may wish to make, I propose to arrange accordingly. The question of providing funds is already under consideration. E.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office,COPY D.O. NO. 205-61/1) XF02?( 6/48)) Dear Donaldson, One point has emerged from conversation with the Foreign Office party who are at present visiting us and that is the urgency of making provision for the pay and allowances of all the staff of the Persian Gulf Residency for the month of March, 19U8. 2. Under the Indian system provision is made for pay and allowances for the month of March in the budget of the new financial year. 3. I have prepared my budget for 1948-49 which was forwarded to you under my letter No.2319-61/1 dated 4th November, 1947 on the old lines but Caccia points out that the Foreign Office do not take over responsibility until April and if arrangements have not already been made to meet this charge it is extremely doubtful whether the Foreign Office have any margins for taking care of it. The sum involved is roughly Rs.60,000 or £4,600 of which approximately Rs.22,670 or £1,700 is on account of the pay of A grade officers. 4. I am naturally concerned that my staff should receive their pay punctually at the beginning of April and whatever may eventually be decided about the incidence of expenditure I should be grateful if you could kindly make arrangements to ensure that this will be the case. 5* I have already reported a saving in the 1947-48 budget of Rs.18,000 under Secret Service, vide ray Express Letter No.207-61/2 dated 26th January, 1948 and expect an additional saving of Rs.12,000 under various heads. It will however be difficult to appropriate this towards the expenditure as under the Government of India rules the pay for March cannot be drawn before the expiry of the month and the Accountant General Central Revenues would not accept the bills. 6. I should also be grateful if you could kindly ensure that instructions for the drawing not only of pay but money required for day-to-day expenditure reach me before the end of March otherwise we shall find it difficult to carry on.

Bahrein.— ■ —— ' V—— CQir/ TXS03/34K2(3/48)G) Office of the Political ResideM, The Persian Gulf, (BAHRAIN)* 28th January, 1948* My dear John, In the past the 'budgets for the Persian Gulf posts have included an item for “Secret Service Funds'. Before the war the Political Resident was allowed 1,000 rupees and each Agency 300 rupees. During the war it was greatlv increased being at one time as high as 90,000 rupees. In 1947 the figure was 33&gt;000, which has been cut to 15,000 rupees in the budget submitted by the Political Resident. This money was not in fact spent on what we should normally regard as secret service activities, although a certain amount of intelligence was obtained and a number of contacts kept up which would otherwise lapse. It covered thre: types of expenditure: (a) presents to Arab Shaikhs who called or were visited; (b) tips to the servants of Arab dignatories whom the officers visited, and (c) various miscellaneous items, including charities to local hospitals, to hard and deserving cases, etc. When we absorb the Persian Gu2f into our system, item (b), tips to servants, will not present any difficulty; either it will properly be chargeable as travelling expenses or provision can be made for it in the officers 1 budgets, when their allowances are being calculated. Equally there should be no difficulty about item (c). for these miscellaneous items should be a charge on the officer’s allowances which would be geared to meet it and not presumably on the Mission Fund. Povision for items (a), presents for Arab Shaikhs is going to give us Hiore difficulty under our normal system. It falls into two parts: first, when an officer stays with a Shaikh, as he sometimes does, custom requires him to give a present. We may dislike this, but it is the local custom and we must comply. We could cover such expenditure for the Political Resident while he is on tour, by including it in the item allowed to all Heads of Missions for 'tours'. For the Political Agents the best solution would probably be to include it as part of their C element. A more difficult problem is that it is also local custom for a higher ranking authority to give a present to any Bedu Shaikh who visits him. Nautrally these Shaikhs do not come to stay with the Political Agents but they will call at his office to exchange gossip and collect their present; if we do not conform to local custom, we shall be cut off from contact with these Shaikhs and lack information about what is happening in the interior. This may not matter very much to us at the present time, but it may become important, e.g. if Ibn Saud t s death were followed by a period of confusion;a n d contacts once broken cannot quickly be restored. So far as we are competent to judge, this sytem of contacts should, so to speak, be put on a care and raainenance basis; we should do just enough to keep in with contacts who might be useful sources of infomat!cm if we needed them. But this raises political issues on which will no doubt consult Eastern Department. It is a good deal more difficult to estimate the minimum expenditure necessary to achieve this, but fortunately there should be a little time for/ A.J. Gardener, Esq., C.B.E., Foreign Office, o, Carlton House Terrace.for trial and error, uur guess is that this item (a) # expenditure, might oe done on as little as £500 for the whole Gulf, but it might be wiser to allow initially for a little more, say £ 750 , on the understanding that the money would only be spent if the Political .Resident was satisfied that the expenditure was really necessary. There would remain the question of the form in which we should cover this expenditure when our system comes into force. We think that it should be a special fund allocated to the Political Resident, who would at the beginning of each year allocate it between the Political Agencies; these could then draw up to the stipulated amount, reporting to the Resident quarterly the sums spent. The Resident should have authority to switch allocations between the various Agencies within the total allotted to him. For the moment this might be called the Mission Fund and it could be explained that whereas in other areas it is the custom to give or return hospitality to the local dignitaries whom one meets, in the Arab world some of the dignitaries are not entertainable and expect by custom to be given small presents in money and in goods. So much for the future after our system has come into force The immediate problem is however how to cover this expenditure now when our system is not in force and wnen the scales of pay and allowances fixed for the Resident and the Agents do not include any element to take account of this expenditure. At the same time we must bear in mind that if politically we wish to maintain our position without diminution in the Guif these items must be covered. On this we should of course realise that our position differs in the Gulf from that at any Diplomatic post, for here we are involved in Administration. What is more entertainment must cover the foreign as well as the local community and a great number of the local community cannot be entertained in the normal way to meals and they can only be u entertained ,, by the customary method of giving presents. Our recommendation therefore is that for an experimental year we should obtain Treasury approval for something to the order of £1,000 as included in the Resident’s budget for 8.S. Fund; we should call it by some more anodyne title, e.g., Mission Fund; and we should lay down that the moneys spent should be accounted unaer the separate items set out above. So far as item (a) goes we should ask the Resident to allocate an amount to himself for tours and to each of his Agencies in the way described. If (b) can be charged as travelling expenses from now on that would solve that item. If not these expenses must for the time being be charged against the Fund as must (c). The Resident should be asked to impress on his officers that the expenditure should be kept as low as possible and should be told, if this is agreed, that the object is ,f care and maintenance”. Before the end of the year and in the light of experience gained we should ask for a report to enable us to judge better how to handle this special Gulf problem in the future.

Sir ■ I have the honour to forward herewith the budgets for this Residency and its subordinate Agencies for the year 1948 - 4&amp; 2* The budgets hove been prepared in the form in which they have hitherto been submitted to the Government of India. In the abstracts I have given brief reasons for savings and excesses. 3. I have not made nny provision under the head 'Central Contract Grant' which is intended for ordinary repairs to buildings. If it is considered desirable that responsibility for such ordinary repairs and maintenance of buildings should be left os in the post in the hands of the Political Resident and the Poll tied Agents the following additions should be r.ade to the budgets under the head 'Central Contract Grant'. Residency ... te.25|000 v Kuwait ... 5,000 Bahrain ... 5,000 Muscat ... 5,000 1 4. The following are some explanatory comments* a) I have allowed for officers on the basis of the posts sanctioned by the Government of India either permanently or temporarily. The cost of t' e two officers whom the Foreign Office propose to send for training will be met from the provision made for Under Secretary to the Political Resident and Assistant Political Agent, Muscat. b) I have also provided for the ministerial staff on the present basis. All our Indian sta^f will have to be placed on a contract basis by August 15th 1948, and it is possible that the budget provision will be exceodod as a result but until the contract terms have been worked I cannot give even an approximatefigure. If there is any substitute of Indian by British personnel additional expenditure will almost certainly be involved. c) The Office Allowance Grant has hitherto been non- auditable. It covers the pay, liveries, and travelling allow ance of menials, cost of electric current, telephones, hot and cold weather charges, rent of Residency Rest House (at Muscat only), cost of electrical equipment, office equipment, repairs to office furniture and equipment, books and publications, expenditure on dispensaries (in Agencies only) and a multitude of minor contingencies. d) The Launch Grants have also hitherto been non-auditable. I have made a small provision in the Residency budget for the maintenance of the 'Diana' which has been taken over from the Bahrain Agency. The cost of maintaining this launch during the current financial year is being met from Office Allowance. e) There are certain other grants which also have been non-auditable in the past viz., the truck grants, the Residency medical contract grant, the Sharjah 'Other Contingencies' grant and the Kuwait 'Tour Charges' grant. f) The bull of the stationery required by offices has hitherto been supplied by the Government of India on indent and no provision has been made for it in our budgets. I am assuming that it will be supplied in future by His Majesty's Government on the same basis. g) Before the war fe*1,000/- was allowed to the Residency and Ite.300/- to each of the Agencies for Secret Service expendi ture. At the outbreak of the war the Residency was given an additional allotment of te.50,000/- about 80# of which was expended on the Arab side of the Gulf. This was reduced at the end of the year and the allotment for 1947-48 was FIs.33,200/-. I have now made provision for Rs. 16,000/- in the Residency budget only and if this is approved propose to make allotments as I think proper to the Agencies. I will endeavour to keep expenditure un&amp;gr ifflafis head as low possible but it is3 necessary from time to time to pay for information regarding the tribal situation in the interior and to give presents in 5, Hitherto the Political Resident has had unlimited powers of reappropriation from one head to another with the exception of the Secret Service grant, and certain grants for specific purposes, e.g., for the Muscat subsidies. I recommend that if possible at any rate while the Gulf administration is in a state of transition he should continue to exercise this power. The budget is a very rough one based on past experience and it is difficult to estimate in what way expenditure will fre affected by the changed conditions resulting from the transfer of control to His Majesty*s Government. If the Political Resident retains his powers of reappropriation much correspondence and delay will be avoided. 6. I hope to submit a rough works budget after the forth coming visit of Mr. Walters of the Ministry of Works office at Cairo. cash or kind to tribal Shaikhs I have the honour to be.
