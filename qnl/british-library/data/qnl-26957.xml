The reason for the withholding of Muafqat ^amahs (deeds of approval) for the import of tea from India seems to 'be that the Iranian Government have not yet fixed the percentage of Lahijan tea which importers must 'buy at the same time. The Lahijan tea crop is said' to 'be poor and stocks available for sale are small.

The National ^ank of Iran at Zahidan started purchasing Ttupee drafts early in the month which resulted in a marked increase in exports to India. (e) It is reported that the Iranian G-overnment hare not issued any “Miafqat Namahs* (deeds of approval) for the import of tea from India during the last six weeks. The reason for this seems to he that the Government hold large stocks of Lahijan tea at their disposal and that Muafqat Namahs will he issued in future subject to the importer purchasing Lahijan tea to the value of 30# instead of 15# as hitherto of the value of the tea for the import of which a permit has been appliedfor.

Each hale is said to weigh about 30 Tahriai mans(nearly 200 lhs)« This cotton is the produce of Khorasan Province mostly from Sabzewar and goes direct to Bajgiran* It is being sent with all possible speed as there is a rumour that no more goods by this route will be accepted after March 15th. (d) 150 Bales of cotton piece goods, mostly of Japanese manufacture| arrived recently from Bandar Abbas for the Zahidan branch of the Shirkat-i-Qumash. (e) The Eastern Bank at Karachi is reported to have refused to accept demand drafts for rupees forwarded from Iran unless accompanied by Bailway Beceipt for the goods exported. The object of this is to ensure that the goods have actually arrived in India. These steps have been taken in compliance with the requirements of the law recently passed by the Government of India in conneo tion with the control over foreign exchange. The National Bank at Zahidan therefore proposes to cancel the present orders under which the Railway Receipts are sent to the Bank at Zahidan before being forwarded to the consignee in India. As a result, this form of pressure on the exporter which is aimed at forcing him to sell his foreign exchange before the goods exported had been released by the Railw/ay in India, has been relaxed.

The Bailway receipt thus delivered will te returned to the exporters only after the foreign exchange has been sold to Government for the consignment concerned. This will entail considerable hardship as exporters may have to incur heavy demurrage charges for delay in the relaese of the consigmment owing to the late receipt of the railway receipt in India.

It is still not known for certain whether the consignment of 3000 'bales previously reported as held up on the Iranian frontier at Bajgiran has since 'been forwarded to Germany or not* ft) The Russian Bank in Meshed stopped all 'business after the outbreak of the 'War. A new Manager, Mr. Loginowsky has now arrived 'but may not do any 'business until receipt of further instructions from Tehran. (c) The fixation »£ by the Iranian Government of the value of the £ sterling at Rials 67 instead of 80, caused consternation in the Meshed bazaar for a few days and brought what little business there is,especially the carpet business, to a temporary standstill. The black rate also fell in sympathy, and in Zahidan touched Rials 1100 per Rupees 100 at one time but it soon rose again to the normal figure of Rials 1200.

The firm has received in advance 70% of the value of the consignment from Herr Semper, the Grerman Agent at Meshed. Several other Iranian firms are also exporting wool to Germany from Meshed. (*&gt; Three Germans who arrived in Meshed from Tehran during the last week of the month are purchasing skins through the Shirkat-i-Mish-Timach. There is a rumour that English and French agents have arrived in Tehran in order to purchase skins; this has resulted in a 150# increase over normal prices. (c) Para 7(c) of last month's diary. The Atikoh Sugar factory is now working regularly. Beet is plentiful and about 100 lorries are engaged in transporting it to the factory. The entire crop is believed to be sufficient to keep the factory going for another two months. The factory pays 30 Bials per Kharwar of 650 lbs and a further 2 BiaLs for transport up to 40 miles. For distances over this limit the additional transport costs have to be paid by the cultivator* (d) I&amp;ra 7(b) of diary for September 1939. Orders have since been issued that all purchases of tyres by owners of vehicles should be recorded on their ownership documents. Further supplies can only be obtained on the production of a certificate from the Revenue Department to the effect that the tyres in use are unserviceable. (e) The black rate rose to Rials 1325 per Rupees 100 at Zahidan during the month but later dropped to Rials 1275. &lt;f) The Indian white carraway seed crop has failed badly. Although price of the commodity has doubled in Iran, exporters to India still hope to make substantial profits.(g) Tea supplies for the whole of Iran are at present 'being imported from India t&gt;y the Nok Kundi - Zahidan route. Beports have 'been received of consider - a'ble delays in passing consignments through the Indian Land Customs post at Nok Kundi with the result that the time limit of the import licences held 'by the importers in Iran expires. Consequently importers have to pay heavy storage charges to the Iranian Customs while they obtain extensions from Tehran.

The Shirkat now proposes to open a mobile agency which will tour throughout Iranian Baluchistan to sell cloth to the local Baluch population at cheaper rates and incidentally to discourage the smuggling of foreign cloth into Iran by making it less profitable.

The cotton crop in Khorasan has been a partial failure this year, 55,000 hales only having heen produced as against 80,000 hales produced last year. This has led to a slump in the price of shares of the Shirkat Sahami Gin and some shares are now on offer at a discount of 25 to 30$. The Shirkat-i-Ghomash Khorasan are reported to he closing down and it is said that the Shirkat is to he 1 iquidated. Retailers are at present being supplied with cotton prints by the Meshed branch of the Shirkat-i-Kul Tehran. It is said that this Shirkat will open its own retail shops in Meshed. The tone of the local market for soft wool is somewhat heavier because of the continued glut on the Hambourg market. It is reported that the Khorasan Customs Department prohibited twentyone merchants (of whom twenty are Jews or Jadids) from exporting Iranian products on the grounds that their exports-of wool to Germany have been of inferior quality. The merchants concerned appealed against this decision to the Ministry of Finance and it is understood that the order has since been withdrawn. The cultivation of opium has been prohibited in Khorasan this year. His Majesty *s Consul-General for Khorasan.No:452-T/15 British Consul flt Q— ^r q^-j-nx yi-L-- 1 .

These amount to Rials 5,000,000. (t&gt;). The market for Russian piece-goods has 'been active throughout the month. 180 Pales were received from the U.S.S.R Py the Shirkat-i-G-homash and 25 Pales were received from Tehran for local merchants. (c) . Reference paragraph 7(a) of the last Commercial Diary. The undertaking to deliver 4,300 tons of wool to the U.S.S.R has Peen reduced to 3,000 tons. The Shirkat-i-Markazi has arranged to deliver the Palance of 1,300 tons from the Dasht-i-Gurgan. (d) . Reports have Peen received that the 60 wagon loads of soft wool shipped for HamPurg some three months ago are still lying at Saturn. As a result of local representations the U.S.S.R authorities have promised to arrange early onward shipment. The market meanwhile is guiet. (e) . The export of soft wool mixed with wool has Peen prohiPited Py the Iranian Customs Department, with the result that nrices have failed Py Rials 5 ner 6£ IPs. (f) . The Balance Sheet issued Py the Shirkat-i-Gin (Cottoi Ginnery) for the year ended the 20th SeptemPer 1937 has shown a profit of Rials 410,000 on a capital of Rials 4,489,000.(g) . The transport of sugar 'beet from the villages and suburbs of Meshed to the sugar factory commenced from the 7th October. It is expected that it will take twenty lorries three months to bring in the entire crop. In 1936 the entire crop was collected in thirty-eight days. The sugar factory commenced working from the 19th October. (h) . New lorries and tyres are unobtainable in Meshed. It is understood that the Automobile Monopoly Company of Tehran has increased the price of motor vehicles by 20$. The difficulty in obtaining tyres and the increase in the price of motor vehicles has resulted in an all round increase in the rates of hire. (i) . The export of dried fruits is now permitted under a licence from the Monopoly Company through the Ministry of Commerce. This Dried ?ruit Company was dissolved some time ago, but it now appears that it is still in existence as a licencing office. The traders who had purchased dried fruits on receipt of the news that the Company had been dissolved (vide paragraph 7(c) of my last report) are now faced with heavy losses. (j) . Since the release for export by individual traders of the commodities classified as Class II consider able quantities have been exported. Caraway seeds alone valued at Hials 1,413,243 were exported during October. The withdrawal of monopolies in fact seems already and inspite of the continuance of exchange restrictions to be having a beneficial effect on trade by the land route to India.

Reference paragraph 7(c) of the last Khorasan Commercial Diary. AS the Shirkat-i-Tujarati Khorasan are unable to fulfil their wool contracts under present conditions, the representative of the Shirkat-i- Markazi Tehran, at a meeting held at the Chamber of Commerce, stated that if merchants were prepared (i) to take over the shares of the Shirkat-i-Markazi in the Shirkat-i- Tujarati Khorasan, and (ii) to undertake to deliver to the Russians the balance of wool due to them under their contract, the Government would grant them a monopoly for the purchase and export of soft wool (koork), goat hair and camel hair to compensate them for the loss they would incur on wool transactions. As this proposal would have involved an outlay of some Rials 6,000,000 no merchants were prepared to consider the offers. (b) . It is reported that the contract made last year by the Shirkat-i-Mishan wa Timaj and the Shirkat-i- Harkazi Tehran for the supply of 600,000 goat and sheep skins to the Russians is not being renewed. The prices of skins are firm and considerable purchases have been made. It is said that the Shirkat-i-Poost-i-Naram intend to dispose of their stock locally by auction. They hold 256,000 ordinary lamb skins and 17,000 gharakol skins. (c) . On the 24th September news was received in Zahidan that the Dried Fruit Company had been dissolved. The result was a sudden rise in the prices of all exportable commodities. Since the local Customs have received no official intimation on the subject, however, they have declined to accept consignments by individual traders for export. (d) . The Iranian Customs officials at Zahidan under stand that the Government is considering proposals to authorise foreign exchange for imnorts against exports of items under Class II up to 70$. The balance (30#) realised by sale J/alroad is to be sold to the Government. In anticipation of this /newsne^s l)©ing proved correct there is once again ^ activity in the Customs House. While only a few days ago there was not a single package for export, the Customs house is now full of poppy seeds, almonds, silk cloth, etcetera, for export to India. The smuggling of silk cloth has decreased as its price (Bials 10 a metre) is not attractive.

(a)* At the Peginning of the month the Shirkat-i-ahomash Khorasan notified merchants that they were pre pared to accept applications for Russian, British, Indian, Japanese and G-erman cotton prints to meet the needs of the Khorasan Province. Applications were to Pe accompanied with deposits of Rials 150 a Pale for Russian and Indian prints and Rials 200 a Pale for others. Applicants were also reauired to give undertakings not to sell at aPove 5^ profit and not to send the piecegoods to others centers for sale without the specific permission of the Shirkat-i-Ohomash. It is understood that applications for some 20,000 Pales of cotton prints have Peen received Py the Shirkat. (P). The Balance Sheet of the Shirkat-i-Ohomash Khorasan for the Iranian year ended 20th March 1937 shows a net profit of Rials 320,000 on a capital of Rials 2,000,000 of which 75% was paid up. This profit is to Pe applied in reducing the uncalled liaPility on shares and the remaining liaPility will then Pe called up. (c). There has Peen a good demand for wool for the EamPurg market. Prices advanced following a notification Py the Revenue Department that permits were no longer reouired for transporting wool from one center to another. As the Shirkat-i-Tujarati were unaPle to make any purchases the Revenue Department again prohiPited the movement of wool. It is understood that the Shirkat-i-Tujarati has contracted to supply the Russians 4,300 tons of wool during the current year, Put have oonly Peen aPle to deliver 300 tons. / 3 . * ■(a) • The Balance Sheet issued 'by the Shirkat-i-Sahami Noosh (Iraq and Alcohol) for the Iranian year ended the 20th J^arch 1937 shows a net profit of Rials 220,000 on a capital of Rials 600,000, two-thirds of which has Been paid up. (e) . Two new Branches of the National Bank of Iran are to Be opened in Khorasan at Bujnurd and Nishapur. (f) . The monopoly of saffron was cancelled By the Iranian Oovemment with effect from the 27th August 1937. (g) . New regulations puBlished on 4.6.16 (26th August 1937) apparently have the effect of allowing traders to export certain natural products in exchange for non-monopolised imports of an equi valent value. These imports will take the place of the foreign exchange which formerly had to Be surrendered. Though the new rules are cumBer- some in the extreme the relaxation of the previous restrictions has given a tremendous fillip to the market and prices had risen all round Before even the details of the new regulations had Been puBlished. It was at first understood that poppy seeds were included in the scope of the rules and the price rose rapidly from 200 to 300 Rials per kharwar (650 IBs), at which figure much Business was done. It now appears that poppy seeds are not so included and the price has again fallen. His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan..0 tNOEX*- D 3 ■ [ 'if? 1 : V I N , yl :1198-5/4S.

The fate of the remaining 5% is still unsettled. Deports have reached Zahidan fron Tehran that applications for import licences will only he accepted on condition that no foreign currency is required. This report has^had a depressing effect and it is hoped that it is incorrect. German rubber goods have taken the place of British in Iran. They are said to be inferior in quality and the public asks for British goods. The German Government has recently imposed a 10 ,^ duty on all rubber goods imported into Germany. If a corresponding export bounty is not given then German rubber goods are likely to compare unfavourably in price as well as in quality with British. The result may be an increase in the smuggling of British tyres etcetera into Iran. The smuggling of Bussian made sewing machines is on the increase. It is suggested that this item should also be included in the list of articles the import of which into India is prohibited via the Sahidan - ITok Kundi land route.

The inability of the Exchange Control Commission to provide foreign exchange has practically ousted the British made 'Hercules' bicycle from the Meshed market in favour of bicycles of G-erman manufacture. An Indian trader of meshed, who deals in 'Hercules' bicycles, deposited an advance of Hials 42,500 with the Exchange Control Commission six months ago but has so far been unable to obtain the necessary foreign exchange to pay for the 200 bicycles ordered by him. The British bicycle, though more expensive, is more popular than other makes as it is more durable. (d) . It is understood that repeated demands by merchants in Tehran for either foreign exchange or for a refund of their rial deposits has resulted in the Exchange Control Commission having authorised a refund of deposits to the extent of 45$ to traders in Tehran. Traders in 3ahidan are hoping to receive similar treatment. One result of the inability of the Exchange Control Commission to provide foreign exchange has been a drop in imports from India via Zahidan to below 200 Indian maunds. Lorries from Nok Kundi to 2 ahidan are running practically empty. (e) . Commission agents purchasing Iranian products on orders from abroad have been to a large extent exempted from the impossible regulations regarding export formalities. Indian traders in Zahidan are taking advantage of this and the volume of export trade is increasing. (f) . The Khosrovi Spinning Mills are in difficulties. Material for the boiler and power plants is lying at Askabad where demurrage amounting to 14,000 Tomans is said to be due. Meanwhile the boiler staff recruited in India are idle and it is possible that they will be returned to India as they are very dissatisfied with the conditions of their employment.

The price of skins in Meshed is now reported to he Eials 8 and the Company has therefore to huy at this price to fulfil the terms of its contract. (c) . The price of tea has fallen somewhat during the last month, partly owing to the fact that credit has heen very much restricted owing to the close of the Iranian year and traders have therefore heen forced to release their stocks. (d) . It is reported that the Iranian authorities are issuing foreign exchange to their own nationals at the rate of £.100 for travellers to Europe and £.50 for travellers to India. Efforts on the part of Indians to obtain similar facilities have so far heen unsuccess ful. (e) . As a result of the new regulations for secur ing the whole of the foreign currency realised from the sale abroad of exports of Iranian origin, a Trader in Eahidan who had a quantity of caraway seeds lying in the Customs for export to India withdrew it. No exports under the present regulations are possible. (f) . In view of the establishment of a Customs Post at Nok Kundi from the 1st April 1937, traders are rushing through consignments of silk and some 543 parcels were despatched to India during the month.

The agency for the sale of motor cars, lorries and motor accessories in the districts of Yezd, Kerman, Randar Abbas and Zahidan was secured by an Iranian trader of Zahidan from the Central Monopoly Company, and Messrs Manaksingh Ujjarsingh are presumably partners of the agent as they have secured the agency for Zahidan. &lt;e).The Iranian Carpet Monopoly Company issued a notice on the 3rd February to the effect that from the 21 st February 1937 the export of carpets from Iran will be solely through the Company to their agents abroad. (f).The Auto Supply Company which was dealing in •Japanese motor tyres are closing down at Zahidan as they have been unable to obtain permission to import t^res of Japanese manufacture even on pay— ment of the monopoly charges.

(d).Deference paragraph 7(f) of the last Liary. On the 5th January information was received at ^ahidan that many licenses for the import of tea had been granted, as a result large orders were placed in Calcutta and it is reported that several thousand cases of tea are at present lying at Nok Kundi, but traders are unable to clear them as they have not yet received foreign exchange. Traders are also experiencing groat difficulty in recovering their 75% deposits. In some cases their goods have already been released from the Customs but the refund of the deposits is withheld, ken while they have to pay 9;G to the banks as ' interest on the loans taken by them to finance their transactions. Traders complain that their 75% deposits have been utilized by the Exchange Control Commission to finance the (e) .The Iranian Government appears to have withdrawn the privilege given to traders that they could obtain foreign exchange against permits held by them as soon as a consignment entered the local Customs. The banks now refuse to issue foreign exchange before the expiry of the 90 days noted Ifi the permit to purchase foreign exchange. This entails further hardship. (f) .The monopoly Company released pistachio nuts for export by individual traders on the 23rd January without previous warning. This has caused a heavy fall in prices in India and has resulted in a large loss to those traders who had obtained permission earlier from the Mono poly company to export pistachios.

The reports were produced by the British Government’s representative in the region, referred to variously as: the Consul General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorassan; the Consul General, Meshed; the Consul General for Khorassan (Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Charles Johnson Barrett; Major Clive Kirkpatrick Daly; Captain Everard Huddleston Gastrell; Captain Giles Frederick Squire).The monthly reports, which begin as one-page written summaries and evolve over time to become comprehensive statistical surveys, provide an overview of the region’s trade. They contain remarks on the trade in various raw and manufactured goods, including: carpets, wool, cotton, skins, tea, sugar, rice, dried fruits, almonds, opium, piece goods and haberdashery. The reports also contain remarks on: rates of exchange, transport rates, the activities of foreign agents and manufacturing companies, manufacturing production, the general mood amongst traders, the state of the market. Later reports contain statistical tables on trade, including imports and exports via Zahidan [Zahedan]. Up until mid-1935, minute papers are included in front of most reports, containing report summaries written by India Office staff.Some topical issues affecting trade are touched upon in the reports: changing relations between Persia [Iran] and Russia, including a trade boycott in late 1932, and a trade agreement in 1940; the Persian Government’s creation of monopoly companies in the mid-1930s; Second World War trade, including lists of goods reported to have been sent to Germany.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Zahidan</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul-General, Khorasan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul General, Meshed</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khorasan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Meshed</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003ba#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
