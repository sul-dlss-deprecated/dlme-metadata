Bunder Shwaikh. The wirelass buildings and the Pier, are unquestion- -abl: : |within the boundaries of the Bunder Shwaikh land. The Pier is (corrupt group) useless owing to abandoning of the coal depot, but we must retain the land on which the wireless buildings are built. Present rent^ at four rupees a cubit^ is R® 60,000 (for 15,000). We can terminate the whole lease at will by clause three, but I am not sure whether this portion of land entitles us to relinquish and retain portion at the same rent. If it does I suggest that we relinquish all except say 1500 cubits which would equal plot 225 yards by 150 yards at a rent of F s 600CI The remaining clauses of the agreement appear to require consideration. As regards the subsidy. I ss should be inclined to wait until he asks for one, which he undoubtedly will do when he loses this rent, otherwise he will regard it as his right. I think that the subsidy, if one is given, should be paid in arrears and preferably through me, rather than through an / » agent in India, and clearly subject to his good behavior. I suggest that the subsidy should ^ small, since with his miserly nature the fear of losing even a small sum would be a wholesome deterrent to Sheikh Salim, and it is useless to expect gratitude from him.

Unless the pier has been washed away or badly damaged, or its enclosure would make the area rented too large, I th^nk we might include both foreshore near pier and land occupied by wireless houses and outbuildings in new reduced area to be rented; or if Sheikhs coal godown is between (as to best of my recollection it is) we might rent each seperately. I do not think that after cancelling lease under clause 3.,we can claim any right to rent portion of ground at same figure; on the other hand ground rent at ^ 4. per cubit peems to me to be very high under present conditions. p.a., might make quiet enquiries as to the other grounds id in the vicinity; I should think they will be found to be quite small. If so I think we might tell the Sheikh that H. i # G,,have decided to cancel lease under clause 3.,but wish to retain wireless buildings and foreshore near pier, that the old rent was fixed under totally different conditions and that as he is aware the value of the land has greatly come down, but that Government is prepared to pay ground rent at market rent. If Sheikh objects to this and wants more as is probable we might tell him that if he is prepared to re-affirm clauses of the old lease, give us right of pre-emption of land mention- -ed in it,and behaves in a friendly manner, we are prepa-ed to pay him at the old rate for the land ( if this does not exceed say ^10,000 per annum), subject to proviso that Sheikh must understand not more than ( whatever is found to be market ground rent) is his by right , and that the balance xa in the nature of a subsidy which will few be paid in arrears (or with- -held) by P.A. according as Sheikhs behavior has been good or otherwise TrevorPolitical Bushire.

Pier is between it and Sheikhs coal shed, but close to latter and nearly a mile from the wireless. As ' cubits' of an area apparently are sum of its four sides 5 rent of a long strip like this would be prohibitive as however narrow it was it would come to over 7,000 cubits. On the other hand if we rented it separately and took 1,000 cubits in a souare each side being 250 Cubits or 125 yards, its rent plus that of plot suggested in my telegram no.,61-C.,would come to 1^10,000 at the present rate. I shall make enquiries on the quiet regarding market rent of ground rent. Four rupees per cubit certainly does seem enorm- -ous but Sheikh will realize that w^nust have land and it seems ra t e possible will try bluff and ask a higher jseikb, so certainly offer our best course is perhaps to start bluff first and xsk loss.

The most expensive I have heard of is a small plot on the sea front near the west end of the town, estimated to be about 100 cubits long by 40 broad, which is valued at Rs, 5,700/-, or roughly • cubit ( but this include# a small building of little y~tUcc£. • T o plot of ground which the late Shaifch Mubarak sold to the American Mission is 200 cubits long by 170 wide, and the price paid was Rs. 3,700/-, or Rs. 5/- per cubit, whieh he told o ,ou a e .. o was half its proper value, A square plot 200 3 cubits each way, situated a little way from the sea, recently changed hands for Rs. 1,600/-, or Rs. 2/- per cubit, which is said to be a very average price.

In addition to it there are two or three one storied outhouses which would do for all deck passengers including women. I do not consider buildings would ever do for Agency without a town office owing to the distance which is now greater than when my predecessors used them as town will Bntails a considerable detour.

My idea simply is that if Agency is really in danger- * ous condition or likely to need extensive repairs wireless buildings would make temporary habitation for Political Agent, But I do not think there is any chance of Govemmeitit building new Agency for some time. Executive Engineer says he ^ not examine Agency building thoroughly last time but could go over early in June and do so if necessary. Had he better do this? If so his report might be awaited, ot? in the meanwhile perhaps arrangement suggested in Government of India telegram No.629-S could be adopted'.

A copy of the agreement is at slip L, Baghdad file 11/4/20. The actual lease of land was terminated in 1922 but the remaining provisions of the agreement are still in force. The reasons why the agreement was not communicated to the Turkish Govt, in 1911 are given in the correspondence at pp. 354-7, 343-5 and 356-7 of Vol. D. 19. Apart from other reasons, Shaikh Ahmad may be as averse to its communication to Ibn Saud at present as he was to its coiomunication to the Turks in 1911, and he appears to have the right to be consulted. Incidentally, Govt, of India having print- -ed it in a cofidential collection of Treaties etc. I had suggested including it in the revised edition of Aitchison's. &lt;V /, J . ,oSa) CU, » i* Bandar ahuwaikh Lease. '''he point for decision is whether by cessation of payment of rent in 1922 the agreement has lapsed in toto or not. Examining the terms of the lease: Clauses 1-b . There is no doubt that the right to the under this agreement use of the land, and the right/to prevent the Shaikh from granting, selling or leasing any portion of his territories to a foreign Power was in consideration of the rent paid (it is specifically so stated) and lapsed with its cessation. Clause 6 . ■djln The right .of pre-emption grantecyin this is clause not ppecifically mentioned as made in consideration of the rental but as the lands to which the right refers are those adjacent tc the land leased, and the right of pre-emption would be futile if we did not hold the: Bandar Shu^waikh land, it may be argued that this right also is dependent on the payment of rent and lapsed with its cessation, when we ceased to hold the Bandar Shuwaikh land. Clauses 9. 10 and 11 . The British guarantee in clause 9, the second part of which refers to any lands in the Shaikh's territory, is the consideration for the Shaikh's promises regarding customs dues in clauses 10 and 11, and is independent of any question of rent. Clause 12 . Similarly, the Shaikh's promise not to permit other powers to exercise authority in his territories and the British assurance of non-interference in his internal affairs appear to be the consideration for each other,k'l equally independent of the payment of rent. (Incidentally, the second sub-clause of clause 12 contains the Shaikh's promise to keep the agreement absolutely secret until H.M.G. permits its disclosure.) The same remarks apply to the corres^ond- -ing clauses of the Acceptance. To sum up, with the cessation of payment 01 rent we have lost the right to the use of the Bandar Shuwaikh lands, possibly the right of pre-emption over the adjacent lands, and the right under this agreement to prevent the Shaii-ch from gran ting, selling or leasing any part of his territories to any other foreign Power. (The last mentioned right, however, is secured by the Agreement of 23rd. January 1899, which is still in force.) The remaining undertakings of either party would appear to be still in force. In amplification of my note of 29th Aug. I give the reasons why the Shaikh of Kuwait was averse in 1911 to the communication to the Turkish Govt, of the text of the Agreement. They were, firstly, because places in regard to which he had rejected overtures from other quarters were referred to by name; secondly, because the agreement contained provisions which were framed as a safeguard against poss- | -ible contingencies which might never arise; If thirdly, because the publication of details would in any case have caused inconvenient gossip among his subjects, ana would also have greatly increased Turkish hostility to him should the Anglo-' urkish negotiations have proved abortive.The Shaikh's views were supported by the Resident and the Govt, of India and the Turkish Govt, were merely informed that H.M.G. held a lease of land from fhe Shaikh. With the lapse of time and the disappear- -ance of the Turks from this arena, the cogency of these reasons would appear to have consiaer- -ably diminished if not disappeared in entirety. However, as the Shaikh is under promise not to disclose the terms of the agreement with the permission of H.M .G. and as he was consulted in 1911, he would appear to have the right to be consulted. ,£ ' 3 /J c f COMginiliTI al .

Letter from the India Office, London to the Foreign Office, London, No. P.-3429, dated the 26 th J uly 1927. T am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of the 7tli July, No. E.-2585|119!91 relative to the request of Ibn Saud that he should be supplied with copies of all existing* treaties and agreements between His Majesty's Government and the various Kulers and Chiefs in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf. The Earl of Birkenhead agrees that there is no objection to supplying Ibn Saud with copies of the treaties and agreements with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs which were communicated^ to the Turkish Representative in London on October 24th, 1911. He considers it eminently desirable that a statement should be made at the same time to Ibn Saud in the sense of paragraph 5 of your letter Vy. Kitj), but with reference to all the Persian Gulf Chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat. As regards the secret agreements with the Sheikh of Koweit, dated the 15th October 1907, the reasons for which this agreement was kept secret before +Jie war no longer exist. On the other hand the lease of the Bander Shweikh 'binds, for which provision was made by the agreement, was terminated in 1922 (reference Colonial Office letter No. 40693(22, dated 22nd August 1922, of which a copy was apparently not sent to the Foreign Office), and although the agree ment itself does not appear to have been abrogated at the time the greater part of it has necessarily lapsed during the termination of the lease. There remain, however, the undertakings given by the Sheikh in Clause ;&gt; (which amounts to a reaffirmation of an undertaking given in the 1899 treaty), and b&gt; Government in Clause 9. It is not indeed clear whether even these—or indeed aI1 y.—clauses of the agreement are still to be regarded as. operative, and Lord Birkenhead would be glad to learn the views of Sir A. Chamberlain on thi&gt; point. But in the meantime, and seeing that the agreement has been kept secret hitherto, it does not seem necessary to supply Ibn Saud with a copy, and it is suggested that instead he should be informed that in 1907 His Majesty's Government gave the Sheikh an assurance as stated in Clause 9 of the agree ment. He should also be informed of the undertaking given by His Majesty's Government as described in the first sentence ot paragraph -r ot \oui lettn. Lastlv, certain special assurances^ were given to the Sheikh on the 3rd November 1914 (Foreign Office reference 64214:14, No. 12), ot the third ot which it seeias desirable that Ibn Saud should be informed, namely that ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under Biitish piotection The Treaty/' concluded with the Sheikh of Katr in 1916 is still in force, and a copy of it should, in Lord Birkenhead's opinion, be communicated to Ibn Saud It appears hardly necessary, however, and possibly undesirable, m view of tlie comparison that Ibn Saud might draw between the attitude adopted towards slavery in Katr and Sir Gilbert Clayton's attitude in the recent negotia tions—to communicate to Ibn Saud the letter ot the 3rd N a\ ember 1J16 to ie Sheikh of Katr. It is suggested that Ibn Saud should also be supplied with existing agreements with the Sultan of Muscat, which might include, in addi ion to those published in Aitchison's Treaties, the latest agreement lor the renewal of the Muscat Commercial Treaty. His Lordship agrees that, in the circumstances stated in paragraph 9 of vour letter, there is no need to communicate to Ibn Saud a copy of the agree- ment^of February 19th, 1915, with the Sheikh of Mavia. With regard to the two treatie^of 1915 and 1917 with the Idrisi Lord Birkenhead feels that, as the Government of India no longer share the control of British policy in South-West Arabia, he is not called upon to express an &gt; h M • is &gt; i , o.

T am directed to refer to your letter No. E.-2585|119|81 of the 7th of July in regard to a request made by Ibn Sand during the treaty negotiation that he should be supplied with copies of all existing treaties and agreements between His Majesty's Government and the various Rulers and Chiefs in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf. 2. Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for India, the Secretary of State agrees to the action proposed in paragraphs, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 of your letter. As regards paragraph 7 of that letter hSrrml.Xn IrHi), the Secretary ot State sees no reason, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for India, to communicate to Ibn Sand the text of the secret agreementN with the late Sheikh of Koweit, dated October 15th, 1907. 3. The Secretary of State has no observations to offer upon the question of communication to Ibn Sand of the Agreement\ of February 19th, 1915, with the Sheikh ot Mavia, referred to in paragraph 9 of your letter. 4. As regards the treaties^of April 30th, 1915, and January 22nd, 1917, with the Idrisi Sayyid, the Secretary of State considers that it would n(5t be possible, nor indeed desirable, tor His Majesty's Government to state definitely that the two treaties are no longer operative. He agrees therefore that copies of these treaties should be communicated to Ibn Sand. ^ 5. At the same time, if these documents are communicated with comment, the extent of His Majesty's Government's obligations to the Idrisi may not be clear to Ibn Sand and misunderstandings may arise. 6. The Secretary of State would therefore suggest, for Sir Austen Chamberlain's consideration, that copies of the two treaties should be com municated to Ibn Sand and that he should be informed that the Treaty of 1915 is regarded by His Majesty's Government as having expired, except in so far •PTTr^r-T»rHT-trrTITT7l9^ + £ro. 1915.

The enclosures to your letter are returned herewith. 8. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office.(Received on 25th September 1927, with Political Secretary's letter No. S6, dated nth S evfe mher 1927.) iign Office, to India Office, No. E.-33821119191, dated the' 3rd September 1927.

It will be seen that the suggestions contained in the two letters mentioned above have (with certain exceptions indicated below) been embodied in the draft. 3. The Secretary of State has now reconsidered the question concerning the validity of the treaties of 1915 and 1917 with the Idrisi in the light of paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Colonial Office letter and paragraph 7 of your letter. 4. Sir Austen Chamberlain agrees with Mr. Amery that the treaty of 1915 must be regarded by His Majesty's Government as having- lapsed, and he pro poses to inform Tbn Saud accordingly. He is not, however, disposed to qualify' pnis stalemont with the words ' except in so far as an obligation still rest's upon ±iis Majesty's Government to adjucate between the rival claims of the lansi and the Imam if and when an opportunity offers '. The 1915 treaty provided for such adjudication ' at the conclusion of the war ' ; and it can not, in oir Austen Chamberlain's opinion, be contended that this obligation still persists m 1927.

To ^oucnsaio Jmn ^nnous commercial f.-icilities, and to offer him asylum in the event or a ensis m ms country. The Idrisi with whom the agreement was signed is no jongei 1;u 1 in ■ r, and has had more than one successor. When the present dusi appealed to His Majesty's Government to implement their undertakings;5% ■ s# I ^ ■ 162 and to assist him with material against the Imam, His Majesty's Government took the line that their engagements only applied in the event of aggression by an European Power. They have on various occasions declined to help the Idrisi, with the result that that ruler, threatened by the Imam and the Italians, was driven to place himself under the protection of Ibn Sand, a step which he now appears to regret. He can therefore hardly be expected to retain any illusions regarding the validity of his agreement with His Majesty's Government, the original object of which was to keep the Italians out of the Farsan Islands ; and he has ceased to serve the purpose which His Majesty's Government had in view, since he has virtually surrendered his sovereignty over the Farsan Islands (as well as the rest of his dominions) to Ibn Saud, and His Majesty's Government have reached an understanding in regard to those islands with the Italian Gov ernment. Ibn Saud having now as'jimed towards the Idrisi the engagement to protect his territory and seaboard, it h questionable whether the similar en- gagement of His Majesty's Government can persist, more particularly since His Majesty's Government have, in the Idrisi's view, declined to carry it out. It can, on the other hand, be argued that if His Majesty's Government formally denounced the agreement, the Idrisi would be absolved from any obligation not to make over the Islands to a foreign Power, namely Italy, which i'Si now endea vouring to detach the Idrisi from Ibn Saud and to bring his territory under the control of the Imam. It is thus conceivable that His Majesty's Government might at some future date wish to appeal to the Idrisi's engagement not to cede the islands, although he would have some justification for repudiating it in view of recent events. In these circumstances, Sir Austen Chamberlain considers it best to leave the 1917 treaty in its present condition of suspended animation, without endeavouring to solve the problem whether it has or has not actually ex pired, and to continue to formulate their Arabian policy in accordance with the necessities imposed upon them by the constant changes in the political situa tion. 6. As regards the question raised in paragraph 3 of your letter, it is not al together clear whether the Political clauses (5 and 9) in the secret agreement of 1907 with the Sheikh of Koweit are or are not' to be regarded as still in force. This question depends on whether it was the intention of the parties that their continuance should be dependent on that of the lease provided for in the treaty. The text of the agreement appears, however, to indicate that clauses 5 and 9 were not intended to have that effect, and that those clauses (and also any other provisions of the treaty which can continue to operate despite the termination of the lease) are still in force. The Secretary of State gathers that it is desired to regard the state of affairs created by clause 9 as still continuing ; and that position seems to be almost identical with that resulting from the assurances given to the Sheikh on November 3rd, 1914. In these circumstances the action proposed in paragraph 3 of your letter appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain ap propriate ; and instructions in the sense indicated have been embodied in para graph 3 of the draft despatch to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. 7. A similar letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office. E.-3382lll9|91. Sm, September 7. . During Sir G.

In communicating these documents to Ibn Sand you should give him the following explanations. His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligation's under the agreement of 1899, His Majesty's Gov ernment undertake to support them and accord them their good offices, but at the same time His Majesty's Government have reserved to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty's Government have also assured the Sheikh that they recognise (1) that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to him and to his heirs after him ; (2) that all his arrange ments shall remain in the hands of himself and his heirs, ; and (3) that they will not take customs or anything in any lands they may rent, or in which they may dwell, within the limits of Koweit. Finally His Majesty's Government have assured the Sheikh that Koweit shall be recognised as an independent princi pality under British protection. 4. You should further remind Ibn Sand that British rights in the Perteian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements which have been con cluded, but on the custom, consent and long established relations of all the Persian Gulf Chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat with the Government of India. 5. As regards the treaties with the Idrisi of Asir, you should inform Ibn Sand that His Maje^y's Government regard the treaty of 1915 as having expired and that, as regards the treaty of 1917, His Majesty's Government hold the view that the expression ' Foreign Power ' employed therein does not in clude Arabian rulers.
