He produced a document from Shaikh Ibrhaim bin Fhalid giving indefinite boundaries. A small part of the land claimed showed signs of cultivation, the rest was open land. The claim was examined by the Land department and the Bahrain Court, the seller, Shaikh Ibrahim oin ^alid appeared and showed the boundaries which included only the cultivated piece. The claim for the large open area was not proved by the petitioner and he was told that only the cultivated land could be registered. He refused registration unless the whole area was proved for him. As the sale was by one of the ^halifah Shaikhs, His Highness’s opinion was obtained. His H-ighness approved the decision of the Land department.

I return herewith Land Department Case No. 824/1346. It seems evident that when the Land Department found it necessary to refer the dispute in this case to a civil court for decision, the case should have gone to the Joint Court as the applicant is a Saudi subject. The best course would now seem to be to take this case on to the Senior Joint Court register for final decision. 3. The sale deed contains references to boundary points which one would have expected to be determinable even after this length of time and I suggest that before the case comes up before His Highness and myself an investigation oj^ the ground be made by the Assistant Political Agent accompanied by the Superintendent of the Land Department and the two parties to the case. If you agree I will instruct the Assistant Political Agent to communicate direct with the Land Department in order to arrange this. Political Agent, Bahrain.0 GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. LAND DEPARTMENT.

Mohammad bin Abdullah the claimant was present but the three sons of Shaikh Ibrahim bin Khalid were not present although served with notices. 2. A rough plan is placed below. The western boundary is stated in the sale deed to be A1 Mirzaz at the northern end of Has al Sabana. Has al Sabana is locally understood to mean iLrising stony ground to the west of the road and towards the north of this y a pile of stones exists. The pile is small and it is impossible to say whether it has been placed in position recently or whether it is in fact the pile of stones referred to in the sale deed. 3. The northern boundary is stated to^ be a ditch. Two ditches exist running parallel to each other with some 30 yards between them. In my view only one of these, the southern^nost, appeared old enough to be the ditch mentioned in the sale deed. There were no signs on the land of any other ditch or of any ditch having been filled in. 4. The southern boundary is stated in the deed to be Al Kaukab as the claimant has pointed out. It consists of a few big black stones reached by the sea at high tide. Enquiries from the people at Askar showed that these stones were known by all by the name of Al Kaukab and that no other place existed within the vicinity of Askar with this name AtU Ctu~- as long as the inhabitants rememberad. There can be little doubt that these stones mark the southern boundary of the land. 5. The Eastern boundary Iml fef the sea. 6. The only uncertain boundary is on the western side and as the road which has been in existence for a large Av IhZ i •A Utc*/ number of years has not been mentioned it can be presumed br^iL ? LL$ * that the e^t^at bf the land was to the &lt;east of it. The western boundary might be considered to be a line marking the end of the stony ground of Has al Sabana the ’ ,beginning of cultivable ground to the &lt;east of it. ilth May 1940.GOV^RFMHIFr OF BAHRAIN LAND DSPARTMSNT Tapoo No.824/1356. © ft No. tiS-7 Dated, c,/t R/Thani, 13o9. 13# May, 1940.

However#1 propose to inform I uiianad bin ibcullah that it v/as impossible for him to acciuire by purchase any more extensive rights than Ibranim bin a-Iialid was in a position to sell. Ibrahim bin Khalld most definitely had no rirht*either at Askar or elsewhere* to sell anything but houses, gardens* cultivated J.onds or bazar property.

They approve of your decision that only the cultivated pieces should be registered in the name of the applicant.

There was a notice from the Land Department asking all property owners to register their properties. Twelve years ago I applied for registration. I bought it from iSbrahim bin Khalid Al-Khalifa. The Land Department put up notices relating to the registra tion of the said land for 90 days at all conspicuous local places. After the e^iry of which 1 was summoned and asked to pay the registration fees which I did. Then I was sumoned again and was informed by the Superintendent Land Department that my conveyance was ready in Court. When I went/L Court I was refused delivery of the document. I beg to assert that the buying transaction was proved before and attested by Sheikh hamad. Had it not oeen so attested I would not have paid the value.
