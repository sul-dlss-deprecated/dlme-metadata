John, while employed as Vice-Consul, Bushire^ in addition to his duties as Under Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sir, With reference to your letter No. P.Z.2485/39, dated the 2nd May 1939, on the above subject, I am directed to say that Mr. R.S.T. John was relieved of the duties of Under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 21st February 1939 and that he is holding exclusive charge of the post of Vice-Consul, Bushire, with effect from the same date. The representation allowance is therefore admissible to Mr. John for the period from the 11th June 1938 to the 20th February 1939 during which he held charge of the post of Vice-Consul, Bushire, in addition to his own duties as Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. His emoluments from the 21st February 1939 have already been sanctioned by His Majesty*s Government - iM- /s vide Secretary of State's telegram No. 196, dated 30th January 1939# 2. As regards paragraph 3 of Foreign Office letter of the 18th April 1939, I am to say that the post of Vice-Consul, Bushire, is borne on the cadre of the Levant Consular Service ... • •\ a - 2 - Service and that it is only filled at the moment by an officer of the Indian Political Service because His Majesty f s Government were unable to spare one of their own Consular officers. This post can hardly be regarded as an effective charge on the Government of India merely because it happens to be filled for the time being by an officer of the Indian Political Service. 3. The pay and allowances of Mr. John from the 21st February 1939 have been provisionally adjusted against Indian revenues. For the reasons given in the previous paragraph, it is proposed to debit Mr. John’s pay and allowances, for so long as he is employed solely as &amp; Vice-Consul Bushire, together with leave, pension and passage contributions thereon, to His Majesty’s Government through the Remittance account. I am to request that the concurrence of His Majesty's Government to the above proposal may be intimated at an early date. The moiety payable by India may be recovered in the annual adjustment in due course. I have the honour to be.

Our papers do not indicate the period in respect of which Watts is claiming.

For the whole of his absence he was relieved by Mr. Vice-Consul Gamble and there appears to be no question of a representation allowance being available for Mr. Watts.

I approached Jcott, the Head of the Foreign Office Consular department, who after consulting Seymour, wno had arrived in Htogland on leave, informed me that the fenran Legation could not provide me with a substitute from inside Persia, and that the Foreign Office were equally helpless with regard to providing me with a substitute from outside Persia. 3 I talked the matter over with wait on and then Sir Aubrey ietoalfe, l.X. ,il.V.O. secretary to the Government of India in the external Affairs department, Simla.

I have now made enquiries into the question of the Levant Vice-Consul at Bushire about which you wrote to me on April 23rd. I find that it was only as a result of an almost unprecedented staff shortage that the Vice-Consul was moved. Owing to the war in the Par East, the situation in the Mediterranean and the Near East and recent events in Central Europe, to say nothing of our requirements in the United States in connexion with the Trade Agreement and the World*s Pair at New York, we have been confronted with a series of unforeseeable and pressing demands for extra consular staff with which we have been unable, even by denuding quite important posts, to cope: and like the Government of India we too have had unexpected casualties resulting from the strain under which our people have been v/orking and seem likely to have to go on v/orking for some time owing to world conditions. We naturally sympathize with Fowle but as in the past/ Sir pindlater Stewart, G.C.I.E., K.C.B., C.S.I.Foreign Office, S.W.l. past we have, I believe, almost invariably met his requests that there should be no intervals as a result of leave or transfer between the departure of one Levant Vice-Consul and the arrival of his successor, I hope you will not think us unreasonable, confronted as v/e are with the series of difficulties in connexion with staff such as I have mentioned, v/hen we feel that on this occasion the Government of India, rather than the Foreign Office, should come to Fowled rescue. I really do not know how we can find anyone to fill the post.Foreign Office, S.W.l. 26th April, 1938. Dear Stewart, I am looking into the question of the staffing of our Residency at Bushire, about which you wrote to me on the 23rd April, and will let you have a considered reply as soon as I can. Yours sincerely.23rd April, 1930. Fowle# who, ns you know, is Political Resident in the iersian Gulf and Consul-'enernl, Bushire (and who is now in London on short deputation in connection with the negotiation of a new treaty with the Sultan of Muscat), has approached me in regard to a very real difficulty which has somewhat suddenly arisen in regard to the staffing arrangements at Bushire. I should be most grateful for any help which you can give in the matter. The position is as follows. Powle’o staff at his headquarters at Bushire normally consists of three officers, a Secretary and on Under Secretary, drawn &gt;om the Indian Political Service, and a Vice-Consul from the Consular Service.

Cadogan, R.C.M.G., C.B., difficulties/difficulties in i^ard to the supply of officers, owin&amp; to unexpected casualties and the necessity of providing for special posts in connection with Federation and so on, find it impossible owing to these temporary difficulties , to replace the Under Gecretary until the autumn. This was had enough from Fowle'e point of view, but in the circumetances he has wil ingly made the best of it. On the top of this, however, he now finds that the Foreign Office have removed his Vice-Consul to China. seen Geott in regard to the replacement of this officer, but the latter, after consulting Seymour, tells him that it will not be possible to find a substitute from within Persia and that the staf^ demands ^rom other parts of the world make it impracticable to aend him anyone from ou ulde* If the Vice-Consul cannot be replaced, the result would be that Fowle would be left with only one officer instead of three. This would necessitate the Gecretary bein left single-handed with a volume o^ work which he should not be ca led upon to perform; it would, moreover, tie this o ficer to Bushire for the whole o' the hot weather instead o' his being able to get a change o* 1 eir at Shiraz £. (the/(the official recess stotion for Bushire), and would leave no margin whatever 'or sickness, which, in view o the climate o r ' Buehire, is by no means unlikely. :;ueh a reduction of staff would, Powle considers, render the position at Bushire an impossible one. The number and importance of the problems arising in the Peraian Oulf have, as you are aware, greatly increased in recent years not only from the point of view of India but also, and mainly, from that of His Majesty's Government. The volume of work has, of course, increased correspond^ ly, and I eel sure that you will agree that it would be most undesirable to run the risk of a breakdown by leaving a totally inadequate staff to cope with it during the coming summer.

'Fowle, who as you know is Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and who is now in London on deputation in connection with the making of a new treaty with the Sultan of Muscat, has approached me as follows. His staff at his headquarters at Bushire consists of a Secretary, an Under Secretary (officers from the Indian Political Service) and a Vice Consul from the P.0.Consular Service. The G.of I., owing to a shortage of officers, are unable to replace his Under Secretary, who has gone on leave after four consecutive hot weathers either in India or the Gulf, until the autumn and the F.O. have just removed his Vice Consul to China. Powle is therefore left with only one officer. In vie?/ of the amount of work involved and of the importance of the Gulf in these days - as much from the P.0, point of view as from that of the G.of I. or the India Office - Powle considers that the situation is an impossible one.

As you are probably aware we are at present in rather a desperate cadre position owing to unexpected casualties and the necessity for providing officers for special posts in connection with federation, etc. The position has deteriorated even further just lately owing to Wylie’s selection for the Central Provinces and I have now heard from Ryan, our Consul-General in Pondicherry, saying that he must have 8 months* leave immediately on medical certificate. The result is that a number of posts on the internal side have had to be doubled up and many officers who have fully earned leave have had to be refused it. r^' ■ J -t Howes 1 Wo. P 0 ‘_ V 71 JAN IS. iND'A OFFICE i SC *( c,.£I r n Homes, mho goes to Bahrain as .Assistant Political Agent, has had no leave since he joined the Department in 1935 and I understand that for two years before that he was with his Regiment in this country. Cotton's case is no doubt nearly as bad, but the remedy for Fowle's dixfaculties about an Under Secretary would seem to be to keep Cotton until the autumn when another officer can be made available. Howes is at present doing his administration training in the United Provinces and will in all probability be available in May. We cannot agree to break off his training three months earlier in order to let him go to Bahrain in February to relieve Galloway. Te hope that the position will clear up in a year or two, as we have plenty of good young probationers coming on, but their adequate training is of supreme importance both to themselves and to the Department throughout their career and I am sure that it would be a mistake to interrupt the process merely in order to solve temporary difficulties. If you agree with Fowle that other Departments ••••••Departments of His Majesty's G-ovemment should he informed in this sense, we should have no particular objection. But I am myself very doubtful whether it is desirable to advertise at.any rate to the Foreign Offic the difficulties which we are now experiencing but hope will be merely temporary. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle. J.G.

As you doubtless know, wnen Todd met Butler at Busnire last Autumn, he told him tnat his health had not stoo® up very well to the climate of the Gulf and that he would be very grate ful if arrangements could be made for him to go on leave this Sumner with a transfer at the end of it. 2. 'tie )»ve now had a telegram from the Foreign Office to say that they are endeavouring to arrange this. They seem doubtful, however, whetner they can send out Todd’s successor before he leaves, and express the hope that if they are unable to do so, you would be able to tide over a bit of a gap. 3. I see from paragraph 5 of your telegram of January 20th to the Government of India, repeated to me number 7, that you are expecting a new Under-Secretary, Cotton, in June. I have an idea that he was formerly attached to our Legation at Addis Ababa, if so, he should nave some Consular experience. I wonder therefore whether it would be possible for him to take over ’odd’s Vice-Consular duties and to carry on till Todd’s successor arrives, supposing tne threatened gap material is es. I appreciate that you would want the gap to be as short as possible and would urge the Foreign Ofxice to d 0 all they could to make it so. II you feel that you could nonage for a bit with a temporary arrangement of this sort, it seems tnat Todd could go oil on leave as soon as ne nad handed over to Cotton. 4. I am afraid that it would be definitely impossible for me to let you nave anyone from here this Sumer. Fyman hasto go to Kermanshah in April to take charge there, ani as I am losing my Oriental Secretary that same month, I must keep Gamble The Hon’ble here / Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, CHS., - ^ ^ , V#iAOt. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bus hire.here to tide over the gap till his successor arrives and for a while after tnat to assist the newcomer into tne saddle. At the end of July he’s got to taice charge once more of the Consulate here. 5. I do hope that the arrangement suggested above, or something on those lines, will be satisfactory to you. I realise that it is not ideal from your point of view, but 1 do not see how to devise a better? and, as I nave said, I will do all I can to get the Foreign Office to send you a new man as soon as possible. 6. r ould Jfiou be so good as to send me a wire to say whether you agree that you can spare Todd in June and whether you can manage for a while if his successor can't get there before he leaves.

I quite agree tnat Todd should *iave his leare but I am afraid that I cannot agree to tiding over the gap in tne way you suggest. It is essential that having regard to local cliraatic conditions here in the hot weather both the Secretary and the Under Secretary (as well as the Vice-Consul) should be able to get away as much as possible on recess and if there is to be no Vice Consul here this is impossible. 2.

My telegram No.21# Foreign Office state that there are no Vice Consuls available outside Iran for leave reliefs and that a successor for Todd cannot arrive for several months. 2. Loxley* s early move will leave us still more short-handed. Unless therefore Vice Consul can be dispensed with or substitute can be found from Indian cadre, I very much regret that there seems no other alternative to suggest (? except) Told postponing his leave. - SSYMOUR.Telegram &amp; /pom Pol it ici'l Htetdeuit Buehire, et ^iaurain* To Hie uajeety’a iiinieter, Tehran, Copy by eir to Ooremment of Indla t Kee Xielhl# } wi m copies oi ; relerant • .« * « uj b ^ajeety f e Becretary of State) oorreapondence. for India, London* ) lo.T/30, Sated the 10th April 1937, Your tel^raifl »o,r?a of 30th aarch, VIC?
