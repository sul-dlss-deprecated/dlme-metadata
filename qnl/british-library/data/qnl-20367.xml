Sir, Jedda, August 3, 1936. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith the annual report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz for the year 1936. It has been prepared on the same lines as the report for 1935, enclosed with my despatch No. 223 of the 4th August, 1935. 2. I should like once again to record my appreciation of the excellent work of the pilgrimage officers of the Legation, from whose exhaustive reports this general survey has been compiled. The intimate knowledge and an experience extending over many years of pilgrimage affairs of Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, the Indian vice-consul, have been invaluable, and my thanks are also due to Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer, Dr. Abdul Hamid, the Indian medical officer, and Mr. C. Ousman, pro-consul, for their most useful contributions to the report. I am indebted to their respective staffs, in particular to Shah Jehan-al- Kabir, principal assistant to the Indian vice-consul, for much laborious work undertaken in typing this report. 3. As in the past, copies of this despatch and enclosure are again being sent only to the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department), the Grovernment of India (Department of Education, Health and Lands) and the Government of the Straits Settlements. It will doubtless be circulated in print to other authorities interested in the pilgrimage. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure. Report on the Pilgrimage of 1936 {A.H. 1354). Index.

NOTHING has occurred, in the twelve months since the last report was written, to disturb the general serenity of the internal situation in Saudi Arabia. Neighbourly relations have been maintained with adjacent States ■ with the Yemen, delimitation of the frontier provided for in the Treaty of Taif was carried out by a joint commission; with Iraq, relations became ever more cordial and were cemented by the conclusion of a Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and 8795 [13777] bAlliance, signed at Bagdad on the 2nd April, 1936; with Transjordan, a visit by Amir Saud, on his return from his European tour, to Amir Abdullah served to emphasise the improvement in general relations in the north-west. Ibn Saud also successfully placed his relations with Egypt on a more regular basis by the conclusion of a treaty with that country, signed at Cairo on the 7th May, 1936, by which, although difficult questions, such as that of the Sacred Caravan, were postponed, important matters of concern to pilgrims and the Moslem world generally were tftalt with {vide paragraph 14). The Italo-Ethiopian dispute, in which the Saudi Government assumed an attitude of neutrality, cast its shadow over the latter part of the year—its influence on the pilgrimage generally is discussed later in this report. 2. The visit of the heir apparent to Europe, referred to at paragraph 2 of last year's report, was one of the more interesting events of the summer of 1935. During His Royal Highness's stay of some five weeks in London, conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza were held at the Foreign Office on a number of questions of common interest. Sir Andrew Ryan continued these discussions later in the year, both at Riyadh, where he paid a memorable visit as the guest of Ibn Saud, and at Jedda. 3. The Saudi Arab Government, in the enjoyment of tranquillity, internal and external, were thus able to devote their attention even more closely to questions concerning the pilgrimage. Unable this year to predict a ' Haj-al- Akbar,' or a Friday Haj, and desirous of reinforcing the efforts of mutaw T wifs, and other agents, in their efforts to recruit larger numbers of pilgrims from abioad, the Government announced, as was anticipated in last year's report {vide paragraphs 17 and 129), a reduction of 25 per cent, in the pilgrim tariff for 1936. This reduction will be examined more closely in a later section (para graphs 113 //.), but broadly the reduction was effected in respect of transport charges only, other items, e.g., mutawwifs dues being slightly increased. 4. The energetic Minister of Finance, under whose segis all pilgrimage matters come, visited Egypt, now an important theatre of propaganda for the Haj, and was reported to have utilised the wireless for broadcasting purposes on occasion. As a result of all this propaganda, and in spite of the influence of the Italo-Ethiopian war, which aroused certain misgivings as to the safety of travel in the Red Sea, the number of overseas pilgrims, including those who travelled in motor vehicles by the overland route via Iraq, was 33,830, as against 33,898. This may be considered to be very satisfactory in view of the adverse factors already described, but the Saudi authorities were disappointed, having expected a larger pilgrimage than last year as a result of the 25 per cent, reduction in the tariff. 5. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhu'l Hijja, fell this year on Tuesday, the 3rd March. The congregation on Arafat numbered some 60,000, inclusive of all elements, according to Legation estimates, 10,000 less than last year. The decrease can be chiefly attributed to a drop in the number of Yemenis and pilgrims of other and poorer nationalities, as well as to economic distress in this country. For the first time the Saudi Government omitted to publish their estimate of the number of the congregation ' standing ' on Arafat. 6. Climatic conditions were excellent, and the general health was good. There was a welcome shower of rain, which served to reduce the temperature and lay the dust. Health conditions deteriorated after the Haj {vide paragraph 56 below). 7 Due perhaps to the incident during the 1935 pilgrimage, when an attack was made on the life of Ibn Saud {vide paragraph 8 of last year's report), Ibn Saud was reported to be circumspect in his movements. The Holy Haram was cleared of all foreign nationals when Ibn Saud, well attended by guards and soldiers, performed the circumambulation of the Kaaba. Even the Sai,' which it is customary to perform on foot, running, between the two hills of Safa and Marwa, was performed by the King in a well-guarded motor car. 8. There was little change evident in the general economic situation. The slight signs of improvement noticed last year were hardly maintained, and the chronic causes of complaint in the Hejaz, in regard, for example, to dilatoriness in payment of official salaries, and the exaction of payment to Government in gold at advantageous rates, endured. Trade received little fresh stimulus, and well- to-do pilgrims were scarcer than the year before. No further attempt was made by the Saudi Arab Government to reduce their foreign indebtedness, althoughcurrent liabilities continued to be met. There were satisfactory falls of rain, and in consequence good grazing, particularly in northern districts. Prices, however, showed a tendency to fluctuate upwards owing to panic created by the Italo- Ethiopian crisis, and increased customs dues on tea and sugar (see under ' Customs,' below) also bore hardly on poorer consumers. The sale of a number of camels, stated to be about 1,000, to the Italians in Eritrea, at a fancy price brought a small but welcome addition to the Saudi revenues, and to camel dealers. Distress remained severe in Medina, but was alleviated by the iual distribution of the Egyptian wheat, and some cash, to which a reference was made at para graph 12 {a) of last year's report. 9. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company made further progress in Hasa, but their activities proved less immediately beneficial to the Hejaz than those of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, whose operations have given employment to townsfolk and bedouin alike. Amongst other projects initiated or proposed during the year, the following deserve mention :— {a) The Nizam of Hyderabad has expressed the desire to supply electricity for the Holy Mosque of Medina, and representations have been made to the Saudi Government to this end. (6) A concession has been granted to a local Arab firm for the supply of electricity to Jedda. (c) Proposals have been made by the Banque Misr to carry out certain works of a beneficial nature in the Hejaz. {d) The piastre project, described in paragraph 11 (5) of last year's report, appears to have made little further progress. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance, however, several companies have been floated, e.g., The Printing and Publishing Company, whose shares are held in a limited and influential circle. {e) Nothing further was heard about the establishment of a charitable dispensary at Medina, mentioned in paragraph 12 (c) of 1935 report. 10. {Vide paragraph 13 of last year's report.) A shortage of silver currency became apparent in the summer of 1935, and during the period May to December, about 2 million rupees were imported by the Saudi Government from India. This was followed by a further development, for early in 1936 the Saudi Ministry of Finance placed an order with Banque Misr for 1 million new riyals to be minted in Birmingham. The new coins arrived in May and June 1936, and proved to be similar in size and silver content to the Indian rupee. They were to be stabilised at 20 to the English gold pound, and their appearance caused a temporary flurry in the market. New and old riyals circulate side by side at the time of writing, but old half and quarter riyal pieces are being withdrawn as from the 23rd June, 1936. 11. The aeronautical society, mentioned in paragraph 14 of last year's report, collected subscriptions from leading pilgrims. The ten Hejazi student pilots returned from Italy in 1936 and were acclaimed as ' Eagles.' They are still under instruction and fly daily in the machines presented by the Italian Government. Latterly, funds were being raised for the purchase of four aeroplanes, to bear the names of Mecca, Medina, Jedda and Riyadh, whilst the French and the Italian Governments have presented the Saudi Government with one and three aeroplanes respectively. The Banque Misr were reported to have obtained permission for an air service between Egypt and Jedda, and Jedda- Medina. Both the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate employ an aeroplane for their own purposes. 12. {Vide paragraph 15 of last year's report.) Further Saudi exiles returned to the Hejaz during the period under review, some of whom have been given important Government posts. 13. The activities of Indian and other propagandists (see paragraph 16 of last year's report) appeared to be more vigorous during the year. Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan, and his lieutenant Choudhury Muhammad Amin of Amritsar, were prominent, as of course was Ismail Ghuznavi, though the relations between these two parties were thought to have become embittered. One particularly pernicious report was published in India to the effect that Ibn Saud had invited 1,000 Indians to make the pilgrimage as his guests, and had promised to pay all expenses from landing to re-embarkation. This was taken up by the organisers [13777] b 2&gt; ■ %■* ' Ik 4 of the Khaksar movement, encouraged by Ismail Ghuznavi and probably other seditionists, and the propagators of the lie persisted in it for a time, though an official Saudi dementi was eventually published. Dr. Shafi Ahmed of Delhi again came on Haj, but is believed to have returned home without the solatium he had come to receive. Indeed, Ismail Ghuznavi appeared to be the sole Indian recipient of Saudi monetary favours, and the Indian vice-consul expresses the belief that Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman showed a tendency to cultivate influential Egyptians, Syrian and other pilgrims to the neglect of those from India. 14. During the year a notable improvement in Saudi-Egyptian relations has taken place, culminating in the conclusion of the treaty already noticed at paragraph 1. Amir Sand visited Egypt for a day or two on his return from his visit to Europe, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman also visited Egypt, where he was handsomely entertained by the Banque Misr. Talaat Pasha Harb again came to the Hejaz before the Haj, and was reported to have secured for Banque Misr the right to collect from intending Egyptian pilgrims all Saudi pilgrim dues, transport charges, &amp;c., and to settle these charges direct with the Saudi Ministry of Finance. He was also stated to be interested in other projects, e.g., the Jedda- Medina air service already mentioned, water and electricity supply and perhaps roads, though he considered these to be too expensive to make at present. By the Saudi-Egyptian Treaty, the following matters of pilgrimage interest were dealt with, viz., the Saudi Arab Government agreed to the reconditioning by the Egyptian Government of the mosques at Mecca and Medina, and to their under taking other works in the interest of pilgrims, including road construction, the lighting of the mosques and the provision of water. 15. In this friendly atmosphere and as a result of the vigorous propaganda carried out by the Banque Misr, fears engendered by the Italo-Ethiopian war proved no deterrent to Egyptian pilgrims, whose number increased from 5,361 last year to 5,723 this. Amongst a number of distinguished personages from Egypt was Princess Khadija Abbas Halim, who arrived by the steamship El Kawsar, but flew to Medina from Jedda the day after the Haj, and returned to Egypt by air, but had to put in the regulation period of quarantine at Tor. This was the first occasion of its kind in the annals of the pilgrimage, and it is noteworthy that a pilgrim could thus return home after completing the Haj, when other pilgrims were still awaiting at Mecca the permission of the Saudi Govern ment to proceed to Jedda to sail for their respective countries. The Banque Misr Navigation Company again provided two large barges for the conveyance of their pilgrims between ship and shore. Unlike last year, this arrangement proved satisfactory, specially on one occasion when the sea was very rough and ordinary dhows were unable to remain alongside the ship in the outer harbour. This year, a steam launch was used to tow the barges from the outer harbour to nearer the quarantine quay, whence local launches were employed. The Banque Misr were stated to have decided to open their hotels in Medina also, but this development may be expected to await the next pilgrimage. 16. Although objections were not raised to the visit of non-Moslems to Taif {vide paragraph 19 of last year's report), the attitude of the Saudi authorities grew more restrictive as regards the Moslem members of foreign missions. The curtailment of this privilege, to which no objection was taken in the past, may be partly due to an incident which occurred recently when the Afghan Minister rented a house at Taif for the season. A somewhat aggravated misunderstanding arose, and the house was taken away from him for the accommodation of a relative of the Viceroy, Amir Feisal {vide paragraph 163). 17. There was no halt in the rush of Saudi ' legislation,' The more important items, from the pilgrimage point of view, were the regulations regarding foreign dispensaries, doctors, compounders, &amp;c., by which a measure of Saudi control was introduced in respect of these institutions and their personnel (see paragraph 67 below); revised regulations regarding the practice of medicine, dentistry, midwifery, &amp;c., were introduced; pharmaceutical chemists and sanitary affairs generally received legislative attention; and a 'National Humane First-Aid Society' was established. Little or no consequences appear to have followed the communique respecting the International Sanitary Conventions of 1926, noted at paragraph 20 of last year's report. 18. No improvement was noticed in the local quarantine station. A certain obstructiveness in the attitude of local officials was evident in respect of visits by officials of foreign Legations to incoming pilgrim ships. The Indian vice-5 consul and the Indian medical officer report that they were hampered in their access to these ships in consequence. Some interest attaches to an article which appeared in the Saudi press in June 1936, in the guise of an appeal to the Egyptian Minister of Health, attacking the International Quarantine Board and its arrangements for the Haj. 19. There was not this year the same tendency to exploit the pilgrimage as a platform from which to ventilate political grievances {vide paragraph 21 of last year's report). Nevertheless, the presence of numerous Arab and other Nationalist leaders, newspaper editors and the like, no doubt resulted in a fairly extensive exchange of views. The unofficial Saudi mission to Palestine and India, referred to in that paragraph, did not in the end leave this country. A meeting was reported of a body styled '' The Young Men of Saudi Arabia' at Muna during the Haj, which is stated to have been attended by representatives of all nationalities except Indians. 20. A technical conference, attended by British, French and Saudi repre sentatives, was held at Haifa in October 1935, to consider matters connected with the reconditioning of the Hejaz Railway, as a through line to Medina. The conference adopted five resolutions, but the concrete result was small owing to difficulties over the question of expense of reconditioning. 21. No Japanese came on Haj this year, though three of the four who came last year were reported to have got as far as, but no further than, Egypt. 22. Strict rules were adopted early in 1936 to prevent occidentals professing Islam from going to Mecca without satisfying the authorities that they had been practising Moslems for a stated period. These rules were modified later by Ibn Saud himself, and it was proposed for the future to require pilgrims of this kind to spend three months in Jedda under tutelage of a religious committee. An American woman named Mrs. Sterling, who arrived in February, was refused permission and left some weeks later. Mr. Abdur Rahman MacBryan, an Islamised Briton, of whom more at paragraph 182, was given permission at the last moment before the Haj. Two other European Moslems, a Hungarian and a Pole, came to notice this year and performed the pilgrimage. 23. Besides the hotels of the Banque Misr, those of the Government were fully booked during the season. The rest houses on the road were not patronised, and, as usual, the Government opened their hotel in Medina. No other develop ments, either in respect of the scheme of Sir Nizamat Jung or others, came into being this year. The Hejaz motor service underwent a radical change after the last pilgrimage season, as was foreseen in the 1935 report (paragraph 94). Individual private companies were required to surrender their vehicles at a valuation for amalgamation into one single corporation, in return for shares in the combine. The assessment was carried out by the directors of the corporation, amongst whom were some of the motor owners themselves. Many owners were reported to have suffered owing to irregular assessment, and there was no provision for appeal against it. Actual transport arrangements under the corporation proved unsatisfactory, and pilgrims were often faced with hardship on the Mecca- Jedda road, where vehicles were unduly delayed owing to, inter alia, shortage of petrol. Greater difficulties were experienced by pilgrims travelling to Medina, where a considerable number were held up for days on the road. Touring cars occasioned unusual difficulties, as they were too few, were inadequately equipped and badly repaired. Spare vehicles were maintained as usual, but the assistance rendered to the pilgrims. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah reported, lacked sympathy and goodwill, and he compared general arrangements unfavourably with those of pre-corporation days. The mismanagement of the corporation culminated on the evening before Arafat Day in an apparent breakdown of the service, for although they had paid motor hire in advance several days before the Haj, many distinguished Indian pilgrims were unable to obtain vehicles for their conveyance to Muna. Interested persons, however, were not wanting in eulogising to the King the success of the corporation in affording comfort and convenience to the pilgrims. A report on the mismanagement of the corporation, in which embezzlement of the funds was alleged, was submitted later on to the King. A half-hearted attempt was made to repair certain of the worst portions of the Mecca road, branches of trees and plants being used, with a covering of earth. The Medina road was the scene of many mishaps, which were aggravated by heavy floods. On this road, shortly before the Haj, serious floods took place and a number of fatalities, involving five Punjabi Indians, two Bahreinis and one38. At the end of 1935 the Saudi press announced the appointment of an official commission for the 'delimitation' of Arafat and Muna. It is believed that the idea is to allot different areas to different nationalities. The work of the commission received the approval of the King, but no effect could be given this year to its decisions. This is promised for the next Haj. 39. The Afghan Minister in Cairo, mentioned in paragraph 39 of last year's report, closed his office in Egypt and took up permanent quarters in Jedda. The Afghan Government deputed an Indian doctor, in their employment, named Dr. Noor Mohammad, for medical work in Mecca {vide paragraph 164 below). 40. Foreign residents in this country were not troubled this year so far as the question of landed property in the Hejaz was concerned. But they had to pay a somewhat higher motor fare for the journey to Medina during the non- pilgrimage season, and, in addition, the cc Koshan' during that period for the same journey was double that payable by Saudi subjects. Indian chauffeurs were again allowed to work in this country and no objection was raised to their employment as mechanical engineers. 41. As last year, the 'Kiswa ' or the Holy Cover for the Kaaba was woven locally. It was also reported that a 'Kiswa' for the inner portion of the Holy Kaaba was sent by the head of the Bohra community in India. 42. No case of enslavement of pilgrims came to the notice of this Legation during this season, as last year. 43. The following tables give the usual statistical information. The figures given are those prepared by the quarantine authorities, but it should again be pointed out that discrepancies occur between these figures and those supplied from other sources. The official figures given below represent, therefore, the total number of pilgrims who landed at Jedda, Yanbu and Lith (no pilgrims landed at Qunfida this year), during the period the 30th October, 1935, to the 1st March, 1936, viz., 32,423, as against 33,898' for 1935. It may be noted that there was a regular motor service by the overland route from Nejef to Medina (vide para graph 85 below), by which route 1,829 pilgrims were transported to the Hejaz, as against 398 last year. The total number of pilgrims who arrived from foreign countries to the Hejaz in the year under review, either by sea or land routes in motor vehicles, therefore, amounted to 34,252, as against 34,296 in 1935 (made up of 33,898 sea-borne plus 398 overland pilgrims). It will appear from these figures that, in spite of the Saudi Government's announcement of a 25 per cent, reduction in all dues and charges, there was no improvement in the number of pilgrims arriving in the Hejaz during the pilgrimage under report. Table (A) shows the increase or decrease in the number of separate nationalities. From this Indians, Persians, North Africans and Palestinians were less by 2,674; 667; 751; and 663 respectively over the previous year, whilst British Malays, Javanese and Egyptians showed an increase of 289; 548; and 363 respectively over last year. 44. It is worthy of remark that while there was a decrease of 4,188 pilgrims in Indians, North Africans and Palestinians, who are among the wealthier sort, an increase was noted in the number of the following nationals • (2) Statistics. Increase over Nationality. West African Somali ... Sudanese Hadhrami last year. 1,386 366 330 168 Total 2,250 who represent a poorer class of pilgrims, from whom the Saudi Government derive little pecuniary benefit. As an offset to this, the increase in the numbers of Egyptians and Javanese must have brought some compensation to Saudi revenues.29. Security was as excellent as in past years. Cases of pilferage occurred at Mecca, Arafat, Muna and Muzdalfa. This was especially the case at Muzdalfa, where pilgrims stay for a portion of the night on their return from Arafat. Hundreds of cases of loss and theft were reported at this place. 30. The King, as usual, gave his annual pilgrimage dinner on the 29th February. Although he was present at Mecca, the Indian vice-consul was not invited to the function this year. The more cordial relations established with the Egyptian Government were emphasised by the latter's representative at Jedda occupying an important place at the dinner. Otherwise, the only other foreign representative present was the Afghan Minister in Jedda. Egyptian nationals, who were shown special consideration, delivered speeches eulogising Ibn Saud. There was nothing new in the King's speech which followed the lines of that of last year. Ismail Ghuznavi interpreted the royal speech in Urdu. 31. With regard to the reforms respecting the pilgrimage to Medina {vide paragraph 31 of last year's report). Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah was unable to pursue them this year. But with His Majesty's Minister's permission he had private conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza on matters of pilgrimage concern. It may partly be as a result that Fuad Bey it was understood submitted a scheme to the King, which aimed at the abolition of the various offices of the Sheikhs ul Mutawwifin (who are three in number, i.e., for Indians, Javanese and other Moslems), and the establishment instead of a Director of Pilgrimage, who would be a paid official of the Government (see paragraph 104 below). 32. Though less numerous than last year a number of highly-placed Indian personages attended this year's Haj. Among them were:— The Hon. Khawaja Sir Nazimuddin/K.C.I.E., of Bengal; his Excellency Amir Abdul Majid Didi, ex-Prime Minister of the Maldive Islands; Captain Nawab Bahadur Abdus Sami Khan of Talib Nagar (Aligarh); Sirder Bahadur Captain M. Habibur Rahman, C.I.E., of Delhi; Mr. Hafiz Abdul Majid, I.C.S., of the Punjab; Mir Jafar Ali, brother of his Highness the Nawab Ruler of Rampur State (U.P.); and Mir Ghulam Husseyn, a near relation of his Highness the Mir of Khairpur (Sind). There were also a number of Khan Bahadurs from the North-West Frontier Province, Government officials, non-officials and intellectuals. 33. In addition, other distinguished pilgrims this year were Princess Khadija Abbas Halim, sister of the late Khedive and widow of the late Abbas Halim Pasha; Sheikh Abdus Salam-el-Qureishy, Sheikh-ul-Islam and Minister of Justice in Morocco; Fawwaz-bin-Shaalan; Sheikh Abdullah and Sheikh Hassan, sons of Sheikh Muhammad-al-Khalifa and members of the ruling family of Bahrein; Moulad Pasha of Iraq; Mr. Abdul Wahid, O.B.E., member of council, Kenya, and manv leading Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi nationalists and journalists. 34. Apart from Hasrat Mohani (paragraph 34 of last year's report), who is an annual visitor and travelled this year by the overland route via Iraq, and Ismail Ghuznavi, other Indian agitators who performed pilgrimage this year were Moulana Husseyn Ahmed-el-Madani, Ali Muhammad Mori Baluch, president of the Sind Khilafat Committee, and the ' Ahrar ' deputation consisting of Moulana Mazhar Ali, M.L.C., of the Punjab and Daud Ghuznavi. Mohammad Khan Ghazi Khan, who is now employed on a propaganda mission in India, also performed the Haj and left again for India. 35. Arrangements for the dispersal of the Indian pilgrimage worked, on the whole, satisfactorily this year, except in regard to the sailings of the steamship Alavi and steamship Islami on the 28th March and the 12th April respectively. Three hundred and fifty pilgrims were left behind on the sailing of the former, and 778 pilgrims arrived at Jedda two days after the sailing of the latter. These pilgrims had to wait here for a period of nearly fifteen days on each occasion. They became a source of trouble to the Legation, demanding maintenance, which was not permissible under the laws in force, as ships arrived just in time to embark them. No compensation allowance was therefore paid by the shipping company to pilgrims for detention at Jedda this year. 36. H.M.S. Londonderry (Captain H. B. Jacomb, R.N.) visited Jedda for the Hai week. Twelve Moslem ratings performed the pilgrimage. 37. The Indian vice-consul discovered one forged 10-rupee note at Jedda this year, but could not trace any other specimens either at Mecca or Jedda. The individual guilty of forging rupee notes in Beirut (vide paragraph 25 of the 1933 report) was released from prison this year.38. At the end of 1935 the Saudi press announced the appointment of an official commission for the 'delimitation' of Arafat and Muna. It is believed that the idea is to allot different areas to different nationalities. The work of the commission received the approval of the King, but no effect could be given this year to its decisions. This is promised for the next Haj. 39. The Afghan Minister in Cairo, mentioned in paragraph 39 of last year's report, closed his office in Egypt and took up permanent quarters in Jedda. The Afghan Government deputed an Indian doctor, in their employment, named Dr. Noor Mohammad, for medical work in Mecca {vide paragraph 164 below). 40. Foreign residents in this country were not troubled this year so far as the question of landed property in the Hejaz was concerned. But they had to pay a somewhat higher motor fare for the journey to Medina during the non- pilgrimage season, and, in addition, the 'Koshan' during that period for the same journey was double that payable by Saudi subjects.

(3) Quarantine. 45. Quarantine measures in respect of the overland motor route for pilgrims between Nejef and Medina (paragraph 44 of the 1935 report) showed little change for the better in Saudi Arabia this year. The increased number of pilgrims travelling by this route this year has already been mentioned, but except for the maintenance of a similar quarantine post outside Medina to last year (where quarantine dues and mutawwifs' fees were collected) and the appointment of a Syrian doctor to Hail, no other measures came to notice. 46. The usual quarantine measures were again instituted at Kamaran, Tor and Suakin during the year under review.11 Kamaran. 47. The pilgrimage season opened with the arrival of a pilgrim ship from Singapore on the 30th October, 1935, and ended with the departure of the steamship A khar on the 25th February, 1936. During this period, 16,586 pilgrims were dealt with. The introduction of compulsory vaccination and inoculation at the port of Aden proved satisfactory. The directqr of Kamaran Quarantine Station reported that the health of pilgrims was very good, and with the exception of an Indian member of the crew of steamship Khosrou, who was landed with smallpox at Kamaran, where he died, no other case was reported. For the first time in the history of Kamaran, not a single pilgrim was required to be landed at Kamaran for disinfection purposes. Sixteen deaths and one birth were reported on Indian pilgrim ships. 48. It was noticed that the steamship Rizwani embarked 256 uninoculated and unvaccinated pilgrims at Hodeida in February after leaving Kamaran for Jedda, where they were treated on arrival. 49. In view of the declaration of the Saudi medical authorities, verified by the Indian medical officer and the representative of the International Quarantine Board, that the pilgrimage was clean. His Majesty's Minister was able to dispense ships returning to India and Malaya from calling at Kamaran. Similar precautions to last year (paragraph 49 of 1935 report) were observed regarding vaccination and inoculation of returning pilgrims. An Indian destitute pilgrim was refused embarkation on the steamship Alavi on the 29th May, as he was suspected of being in an infectious condition, and was again refused on the steamship Jehangir on the 16th June. 50. In returning Indian pilgrim ships the following cases occurred during the voyage :— Steamship Islami, the 20th March : 1 smallpox; 1 chicken-pox. Steamship A khar, the 3rd April: 3 chicken-pox. Steamship A lavi, the 10th April: 1 chicken-pox. Fifty-three deaths occurred on eight homeward-bound Indian pilgrim ships between the 12th March and the 9th May, 1936. T07\ 51. Returning pilgrim ships, as well as the aeroplane carrying Princess Khadija (paragraph 15), were subjected to the usual detention of three (and in case of the aeroplane five) days. The Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage clean on the 16th March. Suakin. 52. Pilgrims returning to Africa via the Sudan underwent the usual five days' detention at Suakin. A number of cases of suspected smallpox were rejected by the Khedivial mail ships, but all turned out to be chicken-pox. About fifteen Sudanese contracted smallpox coming from Medina, and, of ten who were admitted to the Jedda hospital, nine died. Those who did not enter the hospital recovered. Telegraphic notification of this outbreak (which did not amount to an epidemic) was given to all British ports of destination of pilgrims, and the period of quarantine at Suakin was for a time increased to fourteen days. Jedda. 53. No quarantine measures were necessary, or were applied, in respect of pilgrim ships or pilgrims this year. After the pilgrimage was over, the ships arriving from Suez from the 14th June onwards remained in quarantine and their passengers were sent to the local islands, owing to a reported case of plague at p ort Medical Service was maintained by two doctors, Dr. Yahya Bey and his assistant. Dr. Ibrahim Adham. There was again cause for complaint regarding the latter's attitude in respect of the launches of the Legation, which he^prevented from going alongside pilgrim ships, whilst the quarantine flag was up (vide paragraph 18 above). _ , 55. Dr. Muhammad Saleh again came to Jedda as the representative oi the International Quarantine Board at Alexandria. [13777] c 212 (4) Health. General. 56. The health of pilgrims and general climatic conditions were as satisfactory as last year. The Indian medical officer of the Legation reported that the health of the local inhabitants was bad during the months of April and May. Malignant malaria was very prevalent and is, at the time of writing, still common. Many deaths have occurred. The algid form of malaria was suspected to be cholera. There were a few cases of mumps among children. Generally, it may be said that health conditions deteriorated considerably after the Haj. The fifteen cases of smallpox amongst Sudanese pilgrims from Medina have already been noticed (at paragraph 52). Saudi Medical Service. 57. The following is the distribution of medical personnel during the Reason, based on a list supplied by the Indian medical officer, except for transfers to Mecca for temporary service at the height of the pilgrimage :— Mecca. —No change (vide paragraph 58 of last year's report), except for the addition of one new Syrian doctor. One doctor returned from leave after the pilgrimage. Jedda. —Four doctors, two at the hospital and two quarantine. One midwife. Bahra. —A dispensary in charge of a temporary dispenser of doubtful qualifications. Medina. —One doctor—no change. Yanbu. —One doctor—no change. Taif. —One doctor—no change. Riyadh. —One doctor in place of the royal physician who returned from abroad after the pilgrimage. Abha. —The Indian Unani doctor who was in Najran last year. Excluding 2 midwives and the Unani doctor, the total this year was 18, consisting of 13 Syrian, 2 Turkish and 1 Saudi doctors and 1 Syrian dentist. There has been little change in private practitioners and pharmacists (concerning whom legislation was introduced). The Italian doctor was replaced by another, Dr. Fea, whose relations with his Legation appeared to be closer. 58. There has been little development in Saudi hospitals {vide paragraph 61 of last year's report) :— Mecca. —The central hospital is undergoing repairs, where a ward is to be named after Amir Saud. The X-ray plant arrived, but is not yet in use. Four students were sent to Egypt to be instructed in the use of X-ray appliances. No surgeon or X-ray specialist was appointed during the year. Jedda. —Repairs to the hospital still go on. £200 gold was donated for the purchase of beds, but these have still to be acquired. Isolation arrangements are still defective. A quantity of vaccine was imported this year. Medina. —The project for a new hospital fell through. Taif. —The hospital under construction is not yet finished. 59. Saudi medical services showed little improvement over last year and were very far from justifying the glowing account of them given by the Director-General of Public Health to the Paris Health Office at the October meeting. A piquant instance of defective supplies and personnel occurred when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, a determined adversary of foreign Government dispensaries, was obliged to send his little daughter to the Mecca dispensary for treatment for gangrene. Dr. Abdul Hamid prescribed and sent the prescription to the Saudi hospital, but a reply was received to the effect that the required medicines (even glycerine) were not in stock. 60. The formation of the National Humane First-Aid Society has already been referred to (at paragraph 17). In order to secure funds for this society, the reimposition of the 1-piastre stamp tax was suggested. A motor ambulance,' the gift of Talaat Pasha Harb, was in service during the Haj week.13 Number of Cases. Deaths. 3,077 75 113 77 264 103 3,059 20 50 35 3 1 58 44 38 2 4 53 11 90 156 5 2 4 3 61. The following statement of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals for the twelve months the 1st June, 1935, to the 31st May, 1936, has been prepared by the Indian medical officer from weekly returns published in the local press :— Disease. Dysentery ... Smallpox Consumption Syphilis Typhoid Chicken-pox Puerperal fever Leprosy Mumps Whooping cough Dengue Influenza Diphtheria ... Meningitis ... These figures are given for what they are worth and at best can only give a partial idea of the prevalence of disease in a country so poorly provided with hospitals. 62. Compared with the last year, dysentery and syphilis show a heavy increase, whereas smallpox appears to have diminished, perhaps due to compulsory vaccination. Leprosy, for which there is no special accommodation, shows an increase. Diseases during the Pilgrimage Season. 63. Smallpox appeared to be less than last year, although a number of cases occurred among the Sudanese {vide paragraph 52) and Javanese, but none amongst Indians. Influenzal catarrh was a serious complaint during the actual pilgrimage, and malaria was prevalent as usual. Diarrhoea and dysentery were less common during the pilgrimage days, but cases were numerous amongst pilgrims returning from Medina. Mortality. 64. The death-rate amongst pilgrims as a whole is estimated by the Indian medical officer to have increased to 0-8 per cent. At Arafat there were three deaths due to senility, and for the three days of the Haj there were about twenty- six deaths, or several less than last year. General Sanitary Conditions. 65. Dr. Abdul Hamid saw no improvement this year at Mecca, Arafat or Muna. At Jedda some improvement was evident in the method of keeping vegetables clean, bread and meat well protected. Temperatures were much the same as last year. Water Supply. 66. There was no change in conditions this year. At Jedda the Waziria Committee appear to have remained inactive, it is said on account of a controversy between them and the Ain Zubeyda Committee of Mecca. They have issued pamphlets in Urdu with the object of collecting money from Indian pilgrims. Government of India Dispensaries. 67. Reference has already been made at paragraph 17 above to the intro duction of Saudi regulations regarding foreign Government dispensaries and their personnel (also vide paragraph 74 of last year's report). The strong insistence of the Saudi Government on their right to regulate by domestic legisla tion the position of these dispensaries proved difficult to resist, and His Majesty's Government confined their efforts to an attempt to secure improvements in the regulation, a draft of which had been privately communicated to the Legation.14 Something, though unfortunately less than was desired, was secured. The regulations were promulgated on the 4:th October, and His Majesty s Government agreed to their enforcement in the case of the Government of India dispensaries early in January 1936. The Saudi authorities were still inclined to create difficulties, especially over the opening of the branch dispensary at Mecca, which was delayed, and the issue of permits to certain of the personnel to perform their duties. The Mecca dispensary was eventually opened on the 9th February, and Dr. Abdul Hamid found his reception, on going to see the Director-General ot Public Health at Muna, more cordial than for some years past. 68. The Jedda dispensary remained open as usual throughout the ye ar - Dr Abdul Hamid went on study leave to the United Kingdom in September, returning the 5th January, 1936, and Dr. Muhammad Khan was left m charge. The annual supply of medicines and stores was received as usual, and after some delay in customs was cleared, no dues being charged. ^ ^ t ? u 69 The opening of the Mecca dispensary was delayed until the ytli ± ebruary, 1936, as explained above. Dr. Hamid Husseyn was in charge as sub-assistant surgeon, and remained until the dispensary closed on the 1st May, lyob. Arrangements in respect of Muna and Arafat followed the usual lines oi previous years. At Muna, Dr. Abdul Hamid had to hire accommodation for three days at his own expense. Cases Treated in the Indian Dispensaries. 70. The total number of cases treated at the Jedda dispensary from the 1st June, 1935, to the 31st May, 1936, was 41,886, as compared with 43,535 last year Of these the number of Indian pilgrims treated at Jedda was b,d«U as compared with 6,841 last year for a similar period of six months The number of cases treated at Mecca from the 9th I ebruary, 1936, to the 30th April, 1936, was 18,331, as compared to 20,306 last year. Patients of any and all nationali les were given free medicines and treatment. During three days at Muna 260 cases were treated. „ , ,i • . 71 Indoor cases this year totalled twenty-four, as compared with thirty-six of last year Dr. Abdul Hamid performed 160 major operations, and Dr. Muhammad Khan sixty during the Indian medical officer's four months absence. Minor operations amounted to 2,640. ^ . A 72. The following table shows the percentage of the various diseases treated in the Indian dispensaries during the year ended the 31st May, 1936 Medical- (1) Malaria and its complications (2) Other fevers and infectious diseases (3) Urinary diseases, including syphilis and gonorrhoea (4) Digestive troubles (5) Circulatory diseases (6) Respiratory diseases (7) Nervous diseases...

The practice noted in paragraph 65 of the report for 1933 m respect of a charge of 5 rupees for cost of transport made to patients visited m their own quarters was followed again this year. About forty visits were made free to indigent persons.15 Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 74. There was no change this year in the Dutch and Egyptian medical missions, though Dr. Abdul Hamid was much impressed by the up-to-date equipment of the former. A new Afghan doctor arrived, with a stock of medical stores, but was reported to have worked in Mecca for one month only. There was no Russian doctor here this year. An Algerian doctor accompanied the pilgrims from that country. 75. The Italian Legation opened a dispensary in Jedda with one doctor. Dr. Fea already mentioned above, and with accommodation for four indoor patients. The doctor recently left for Rome, and it is rumoured that on his return he will be bringing with him an X-ray plant and nurses for a hospital which it is stated the Italian Government propose to establish in Jedda. Medical Arrangements on Pilgrim Ships. 76. Medical arrangements were generally satisfactory. The recommenda tion referred to at paragraph 88 in last year's report has been incorporated in the Indian Pilgrim Shipping Rules. Publicity. 77. An article by the Indian medical officer on Medical Hints for Pilgrims was again published in India, in which it was stressed that doctors and other medical men coming on pilgrimage should not attempt to practise in the Hejaz unless they first obtain a permit from the local Government to do so. Also, the local Government did some publicity work by holding a first aid demonstration before the pilgrimage at Mecca. In addition, when malaria was seriously prevalent at Mecca, three articles on the subject were published by the U mm-al-Qura. Legation Medical Staff. 78. Dr. Abdul Hamid proceeded to the United Kingdom in September on study leave. It is recorded with pleasure that he obtained a well-merited diploma of tropical medicine in the School of Tropical Medicine of the University of Liverpool. There were certain changes in the subordinate staff, all of whom worked with their accustomed zeal. (5) Internal Transport. 79. As was anticipated in paragraph 94 of last year's report, the King issued a Royal decree sanctioning the amalgamation of the various motor companies into a single corporation. The new corporation consisted of two sections: {a) comprising vehicles surrendered by the companies; and (&amp;) consisting of Government vehicles. Two-thirds of the total number of pilgrims were to be allotted to section {a), and one-third to (&amp;), and they were to work independently of each other and be responsible for their own profit or loss. 80. The first year of the corporation's operations proved so unsatisfactory that after the pilgrimage a considerable agitation was raised against it by the shareholders. A Royal Commission was appointed as a result, and it is reported that its investigations led to stricter enquiry into the accounts. One welcome feature of the new corporation is that an attempt was made to place before the public a statement of its operations, for general information. In brief, the report published by the corporation shows that in the year under review the corporation (including both sections) carried a total of 24,444 pilgrims and others, as follows From Mecca to Medina and back From Jedda to Medina and back From Mecca to Jedda (single) From Jedda to Mecca (single) From Yanbu to Medina (single) From Yanbu to Mecca (single) From Medina to Mecca (single) ( 4 )From Medina to Mecca and back to Medina 6,062 2,226 4,051 10,320 42 221 172 1,350 24,444 ( 4 ) The number of overlanders by the Nejef-Medina route.16 The report, however, gave no account of income, expenditure, profit and loss in respect of the Government section of the corporation. E-ather surprisingly, a dividend of 121 per cent, for the year was declared. The following table sets forth the sources of income of section (a) of the corporation — No particulars are afforded in the report of the last item in the statement of income, but it is believed to have been derived from the hiring of vehicles to pilgrims for performance of the ' Umra,' which would mean that this amount also is derived from pilgrims. It would, therefore, appear that 92 per cent, of the income of section {a) of the corporation was derived from pilgrims. 81. The Indian vice-consul deplores that pilgrims, who were the source ot so large a proportion of income, should have their interests and comfort so little studied. The difficulties, and often the hardships, undergone have been mentioned at paragraph 23 above. He is severe in condemnation of the corporation, and insists that minimum requirements should be : (1) that rolling-stock should be properly repaired and adequately equipped; (2) proper arrangements for the comfort of pilgrims should be made in case of accidental detention, &amp;c., on the road; and (3) arrangements should be made for an adequate supply of water, petrol, spare parts, &amp;c., at road stations. 82. On the dispersal of the pilgrimage from Mecca, the Minister of Finance was credibly reported to have granted permission to leave first to those pilgrims who were proceeding to Medina, at the expense of those who, in some cases, had performed the pilgrimage to that sacred city earlier, and who in any case were anxious to leave for Jedda as early as possible. As a result, the pick of the motor transport was taken for Medina, and the sorry remnants left to those from whom, their pilgrimage over, the custodian of the Saudi revenues had less to expect. Additional expense and further delays were a natural consequence for these unfortunates, and Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah draws a moving picture of stranded pilgrims on the Mecca-Jedda road, and, even where all were bound for Jedda, of stalwart Egyptians, Arabs and others ousting weaker brethren from their seats in such motor transport as was available. 83. The proportion of poorer pilgrims was again greater this year, as would appear from the fact that only 10,072 pilgrims, or about 33 per cent., travelled to Medina by motor this year, while the number of Indians alone who visited Medina, either by motor or by camel, can again safely be estimated to be about 60 per cent. . . n i -i • • 84. The same difficulty was again experienced by well-to-do pilgrims m securing motor transport to Arafat. The charges were the same as last year, viz., £1^ gold a head by bus and gold a head by car. Overland Routes. 85. It is pleasing to record that no motor vehicle came with pilgrims from India this year by land all the way. This may be attributed to the fact that the agreement over the Nejef-Medina route prohibits the passage of motor cars conveying pilgrims, other than those of the concessionnaires, who this year were Abbud Shallash and Co. of Bagdad. This route was the only one recognised by the Government of Iraq, who declared in January 1936 that they had adopted the necessary measures to prohibit the transport of pilgrims from or to Iraq via any other overland route; 1,829 pilgrims travelled by car by this route in the year under review, including about 200 Indians. Those who desired to visit Kerbela before the Haj were enabled to do so. Many Indians travelling by this route would have preferred to return home after the Haj by sea from Jedda, but as by Government of Iraq regulation they had been obliged to take return tickets, and as the Iraqi company were not prepared to refund the cost of the return journey, nor the Saudi Government to permit single journeys from Piastres Miri at 110 to a gold 'pound. From pilgrims ... From natives From Government Miscellaneous sources 9,385,2041 534,818i 309,4461 247,0891 10,476,55817 Medina to Mecca by motor vehicles (although the contrary would appear to be indicated in their guide), the pilgrims for the most part were unwilling to incur the loss involved, and so returned to India via Iraq. The fares were as follows :— Nejef to Medina and hack. LD. 1st class ... ... ... ... ... 18/500 2nd class 14/500 3rd class ... ... ... ... ... 10/250 Pilgrims were loud in their praises of the comfort of the Iraqi vehicles, and the arrangements made for safety, water supply, &amp;c., within Iraq. In Saudi Arabia security on the road was as good as ever, whilst at Hail a strict examination was made by the Saudi authorities of pilgrims' effects. 86. It was reported that 250 Syrian pilgrims came overland from Damascus by camel, taking one month to reach Medina. Two motor vehicles, carrying Indian pilgrims, also arrived in Mecca direct from Basra via Hasa and Riyadh, in spite, it would seem, of the Iraqi Government's measures referred to above. 87. King Abdul Aziz is believed to be still most desirous of opening over land routes from the Persian Gulf for pilgrim traffic. With regard to the route from Uqair via Riyadh to Mecca, it was reported that the King was anxious to promote the establishment of a motor service on this route, under conditions and terms of a favourable nature. A reference will be made below to destitute pilgrims travelling by this motor route on foot, and also at paragraph 218 to some 200 pilgrims who came overland from Koweit, mainly by camel. Camels. 88. Saudi officials brought pressure to bear on mutawwifs to induce the pilgrims in their charge to travel to Medina in motor vehicles. As a result, the number of pilgrims who travelled to Medina remained almost the same as that of last year, in spite of the greater number of poorer pilgrims on Haj. The camelmen were recipients of a small share of the hire of their beasts for pilgrim transport to Arafat and Medina, and, accordingly, were reluctant to employ their animals. On the evening before Arafat Day, camels were not available, and mutawwifs had to pay a few riyals from their own pockets to arrange conveyances for their pilgrims. A similar situation arose in respect of camel conveyance to Medina. Further, the Government prohibited the sale by cameleers of ' shuqdufs ' (litters) to pilgrims, preferable to the latter as being cheaper, and instead fixed a sum of £1 gold for ' shuqduf ' hire and other expenses, e.g., mats for the litter, wages of servant, &amp;c. Cabs. 89. The same practice as last year was followed in respect of the use of cabs in the town of Mecca. Dhows. 90. The arrangement of last year (paragraph 105 of the 1935 report) was again renewed between the Government of India and Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. for the conveyance of pilgrims and their luggage between ship and shore and vice versa. Though extortion by dhowmen was still practised, fewer complaints were received this year and an improvement in this respect took place. The presence of a representative of the local shipping company to supervise embarkation was useful. General. 91. No attempt was again made this year to prevent pilgrims from travelling on foot between Mecca and Jedda, but stringent measures were adopted on the Medina road, and hundreds of pedestrian pilgrims were brought back to Jedda from Rabigh. A number of pedestrians were returned to Mecca from very close to Medina. A special police officer was deputed from Jedda, with a posse of constables, to reinforce the police at Rabigh for the control of pedestrian traffic on the Medina road. Those who could pay the sum of 69 rupees were allowed to [13777] d18 continue their iourney on foot to Medina (vide paragraph 25 above). ^ Pedestrians who attempted to cross Arabia from Ujair on the Hasa coast will be dealt with under ' Destitutes ' at paragraph 156 below. (6) Customs. 92. (Paragraph 110 of the 1935 report.) There was no improvement evident this year in regard to smuggling and venality. The Director of Customs at has caused high walls to be constructed all round the quay, but the evil is dimcuit to check with a customs staff virtually unpaid for long periods. ^ f 93. Indian pilgrims were subjected to a new duty this year. It a party oi pilgrims was in possession of more than one bag of rice, duty on the remaining bags was charged at the full rate instead of being exempted as m past years. Javanese pilgrims are exempted from the duty under this head, as they come under an arrangement whereby a maximum sum of 5 piastres miri is recovered from each of them for any amount of rice they carry. 94. Pilgrims experienced some difficulty this year on passing through the Jedda customs on their homeward journey. Unlike previous years, only one door of the customs gate was opened, and at a late hour of the morning, when serious overcrowding took place. Many pilgrims received injuries in the struggle which ensued, and some Afghan pilgrims used force and left the quay without showing their passes. 95. After the pilgrimage season was over the Government announced a further reduction of customs duties on a number of articles, the publication of which would indicate less sensitiveness on the part of the Saudi Government to charges by strict Wahhabis of tolerating the import of articles of luxury. The reduction affected artificial silk, thread, perfume, wood, cement, jewellery and Egyptian rice. On the same day (the 27th March) the Government announced the imposition of a licence system for the importation of tea and sugar. This turned out not to be, as at first thought, a monopolistic development, but in the nature of a disguised surtax (of 1 piastre miri) on these commodities. The tax may be expected to be felt by the poorer classes. (7) Religious Policy. 96. Committees of virtue existed in name only and their functions were again carried out by the constables. The permission to use radio sets in the coastal towns, mentioned in paragraph 113 of last year's report, was extended to Mecca, but their use was limited to receiving the news bulletins, lectures, religious discourses, &amp;c. Music was to be taboo, but this was observed in the breach. The Crown Prince used a radio set, it is stated, in his residence at Mecca, which was just opposite to the Holy Haram, and pilgrims were not a little surprised to hear the melodious notes of Egyptian singers invade that sacred atmosphere. The Government adventured even further into modernism by allowing music in the army, thereby shocking Indian pilgrims, particularly when music was played in front of the Holy Haram itself, against which they protested to the King. 97. The Nizam of Hyderabad approached Ibn Saud for permission to repair the walls of the cemeteries at Mecca and Medina. The chief engineer of the Hyderabad State, who came here with the special mission of obtaining permission for the installation of electricity in the Holy Haram of Medina, was also said to have tried to obtain permission for the building of a library on the spot where the Holy Prophet was born. The result of his effort was not known. A wealthy Indian merchant also applied to Ibn Saud for permission to build a mosque over the Holy Spot, but was unsuccessful, as the Government stated that they were considering the question of constructing a library there themselves. 98. With all this show of tolerance the Saudi authorities, nevertheless, were as restrictive as ever regarding visits to tombs and shrines. An Indian pilgrim who went to visit ' Jebel Tor ' (in Mecca) was seriously injured by the Saudi guards on duty. Yet, on the whole, pilgrims had again less reason to complain of excessive religious zeal shown by the Wahhabi authorities. The action of the Saudi authorities in returning a party of Indian pilgrims from Mecca to Jedda for non-payment of dues (already mentioned at paragraph 25 above) was a source of great regret to Indian pilgrims generally. 99. The greater religious tolerance evident did not prevent the occurrence of isolated incidents, as when after the pilgrimage the tomb of a venerated19 Yemeni saint, which was within a private house at Jedda, was opened and the body exhumed for reburial in the public graveyard. 100. The attitude of the Saudi authorities to recent converts to Islam is dealt with at paragraph 22 above. (8) Mutawwifs. 101. The activities of agitators and seditionists like Ismail Ghuznavi and Mohammad Khan Ghazi Khan {vide paragraph 122 of last year's report) have unfortunately met with a measure of success, and the good and harmonious relations between the Indian vice-consul and the various Saudi authorities concerned in the pilgrimage have been for the time being prejudiced. The agitators were able to influence Ibn Saud, it is thought, by forwarding to him copies of inflammatory articles published in the Indian vernacular press (these articles often being of their own composition), in which pilgrims, returning from the Hejaz, are described as carrying away the impression that the British authorities here exercised a predominant control in pilgrimage affairs. The Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs first took the initiative in raising the question of the black-list system maintained by the Government of India in respect of mutawwifs. The Sheikh-ul-Mutawwifin, joined in the campaign by encouraging mutawwifs and their wakils not to lend themselves to the old practice by which the Indian vice-consul was able to redress many of the grievances of pilgrims by his private efforts, 102. The number of complaints against mutawwifs made by pilgrims was perhaps in consequence larger and of a more serious nature than last year. Articles appearing in such organs of the Indian vernacular press as the Aman of Delhi and the Mukhtoo-i-Alam of Moradabad, depicted the misconduct of mutawwifs in no uncertain terms. 103. There was undoubtedly a tendency to place obstacles in the way of the Legation in matters connected with the welfare of the Indian pilgrimage, and this tendency may be expected to increase. The Saudi authorities may develop an attack on the following lines : (1) Pilgrims should not be allowed to deposit their return tickets with the Legation; (2) the Legation should not have any con nexion with the arrangement of accommodation of pilgrims in homeward-bound vessels; (3) the black-listing system of the Legation should be abolished; and (4) the pilgrims should not be allowed to ventilate their grievances to the Legation, and should any complaint reach them, the Legation should direct the pilgrim to approach the local authorities. This corresponds with the thesis of Ismail Ghuznavi that from the moment of the pilgrims' arrival in Saudi waters till their departure for home, they should have no concern whatsoever with the Legation, and must look to the Saudi Government for help and assistance during their stay in the Hejaz. 104. In contrast to the above, it may be noted that, on the expiry of the Haj, Fuad Bey Hamza, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, sought the advice of the Indian vice-consul on certain matters of pilgrimage reorganisation. His Majesty's Minister assented to this exchange of views, but the ill-health of Fuad Bey and his subsequent departure from the Hejaz limited the scope of the discussions. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, however, suggested that the present system of having three Sheikhs-ul-Mutawwifin for Indians, Javanese and other nationals, should be abolished, and in their place a Central Pilgrimage Office should be established, attached to the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. It is reported that the question of establishing a Central Pilgrimage Office is receiving the consideration of the King, though it may be expected to meet with the united opposition of the three Sheikhs-ul-Mutawwifin. 105. No improvement other than that referred to in paragraph 118 of last year's report took place. Further instances of intrigue to secure agencies were reported. It is more satisfactory to note that wakils generally displayed no opposition to the Indian vice-consul this year. 106. The other recommendation of the Indian vice-consul (paragraph 119 of last year's report) requiring the personal presence of wakils at Jedda to meet incoming pilgrims, was not carried out this year. 107. In spite of the efforts of the Saudi Government, the conduct of the pilgrim guides whilst in India and during the Haj remained as unsatisfactory as last year {vide paragraph 120 of 1935 report). Even cases involving the [13777] d 220 modesty of Indian women came to the notice of the Indian vice-consul, although they proved difficult to follow up. Some mutawwifs complained direct from India to the Legation against fellow-mutawwifs for improper competition in securing their pilgrims and also to the Saudi Minister of Finance, but action by the Saudi authorities appeared to be confined to the despatch of a cable by the Sheiikh-ul-Mutawwifin to mutawwifs in India warning them to behave properly. The procedure regarding the visits of ' Sabees ' to India remained the same as last year, and though mutawwifs were free to visit India, ' Sabees ' could only do so as representatives of those mutawwifs who were unable to go in person. 108. The hopes anticipated in paragraph 121 of last year's report were not borne out. Many mutawwifs, it is alleged, paid up to £1 gold or 22-8 rupees to acquire each pilgrim when in India, a significant matter when their income amounts to 26 rupees per pilgrim as prescribed by the tariff, including their share in the Medina transport. Not only do mutawwifs batten on pilgrims, but the Government are themselves severe not only to pilgrims but to mutawwifs, when their revenues are affected, and collect the full amount of dues from mutawwifs, even on account of their destitute pilgrims who are unable to pay. Mutawwifs sometimes are required to pay for the destitute pilgrims of the Sheikh-ul- Mutawwifin, a case in point having arisen this year, when a number of destitute pilgrims arrived in the name of the sheikh, but were allotted by him to different mutawwifs for the payment of Government dues. 109. Despite all, the mutawwifs are still very much alive and active, though they may be in debt and not so contented as formerly. They exploit the pilgrims by various means, including those of appealing to their charitable instincts, and to their religious feelings by the practice of Haj-i-Badhal, whereby quite ordinary articles are invested with great religious value as souvenirs, &amp;c. 110. (Paragraph 124 of the 1935 report.) The payment of dues in advance again was the source of considerable trouble, and it would not be surprising if the Saudi Government were to adopt more stringent measures in future in dealing with this question. The hardship of being detained at Jedda for a considerable time has been referred to at paragraph 25 above. 111. There was no change in the ' Taqrir ' system. The question of its restoration has, however, been raised by interested parties, who point out to the Saudi authorities that if Moslem countries are divided under the ' Taqrir ' system and allotted to prescribed mutawwifs, increased revenue would accrue to the Treasury. The matter is now under the consideration of the Government, but in the meantime they have directed mutawwifs to present their old documents granting them the ' Taqrir ' under the Turkish regime. 112. No attempt could be made to pursue the question referred to in para graph 126 of last year's report, in connexion with the proposal to have Indians of the Shia faith under the care of the Indian Sheikh-ul-Mutawwifin. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 113. In paragraph 129 of the 1935 report it was anticipated that the Saudi Government would make a reduction of 25 per cent, in their pilgrim tariff for the following year. When it appeared it was seen that the reductions related to charges for transport of pilgrims by motor and camel, as well as on the ' Shuqduf ' hire. An unfortunate feature, however, was the consolidation of a number of items into one lump sum which was to be paid in advance at Jedda on landing. This year, therefore, no details of the component charges and dues under this one item were shown in the pilgrimage tariff, but in their stead the consolidated amount of £2-695 gold was given as representing certain particularised items as for last year, with the addition of tent hire for Arafat. This sum, at the prevailing exchange rate during the season, amounted to about 59 rupees, against about 54 rupees of last year, an increase of about 5 rupees. As a result of the reduction of 25 per cent., the aggregate amount which a pilgrim had to pay was less this year, though the actual reduction was not so great as had been anticipated, and was criticised as it was accompanied by more stringent provisions for collection. 114. Another unfortunate feature of the enforcement of the revised tariff was that the poorer classes of pilgrims, e.g., Sindhis, Afghans and Malabaris, who formerly used to enjoy concessional rates, had the privilege withdrawn this year •md were made to pay full tariff alike with other pilgrims. It created considerable SJ « , r21 difficulty not only for the pilgrims, but for the Legation. The Government instructed wakils not to allow pilgrims to proceed to Mecca, unless their dues had been paid. It proved difficult for wakils to exercise control, as some pilgrims managed to evade their notice and walked to Mecca. This led wakils to attempt closer supervision, and one of them went so far as to place a party of Bengali pilgrims under lock and key for fifteen days, until released on the intervention of the Legation, as already recorded at paragraph 25 above. Sudanese pilgrims had to pay this year a sum of 141^ piastres miri against a variable but smaller sum last year (vide paragraph 194 below). 115. The Legation again prepared this year a tentative estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred by a pilgrim during his pilgrimage, on the lines of last year, based on the revised Saudi tariff. Ismail Grhuznavi also published a guide in India, in which he stated that a sum of 440 rupees would be required for a third-grade pilgrim travelling in the Hejaz by camel, against the sum of 540 rupees estimated by this Legation for the same grade. The most mischievous feature of his propaganda was in giving a misleading estimate of expenditure for a third-grade pilgrim using buses for transport in the Hejaz. 116. Indian pilgrims, who arrived by the overland route of Iraq-Medina, were not allowed to take single tickets for their journey from Medina to Mecca, though apparently permissible under the regulations contained in the manual published by the Saudi Government. In addition full taxes were collected from them, as in the case of pilgrims arriving at Jedda by sea, including boat hire, coolies' charges, house rent at Jedda, &amp;c.—items which do not arise where pilgrims travelling overland are concerned. 117. Pilgrims who travelled overland on foot via Hasa were detained at Buraida, and were charged a sum of 45 rupees. Pedestrian pilgrims travelling to Medina from Mecca were detained at Rabigh and made to pay a sum of 69 rupees a head before being granted permission to proceed further, though no item on this score was shown in the Saudi schedule of dues and charges. 118. In the past the Saudi Government used to permit pilgrims to travel to Medina direct from Jedda (without visiting Mecca) on payment of the motor hire equivalent to the fare between Mecca and Medina plus the amount of ' Koshan ' for the journey from Jedda to Mecca. But this year a different and rather curious procedure was adopted, as from the 21st January, in that for the above journey a pilgrim was charged the usual motor hire plus the full motor hire for the journey to Mecca from Jedda. For instance, a pilgrim who visited Medina from Mecca had to pay £7^ gold only, while those who visited Medina from Jedda were to pay £7^ gold for the journey from Jedda to Medina and back plus a further sum of three-quarters of a sovereign for the journey to Mecca from Jedda, i.e., a total of £8J gold. The Legation was bombarded with enquiries by puzzled pilgrims over this novel procedure. 119. The facilities referred to in paragraph 130 of last year's report again proved of great help to pilgrims. 120. In view of the difficulties created by Indian agitators like Ismail Ghuznavi and others, the Indian vice-consul was unable to pursue the recommendations referred to in paragraph 131 of the 1935 report. 121. The same inability of pilgrims to realise that Saudi dues are fixed in terms of gold was observed this year. The difference between the estimate and the actual amount was very small. 122. Again the published tariff of the Saudi Government did not include the charge for motor transport to and from Arafat. The rates were the same as last year and are given at paragraph 84 above. 123. Transport charges for the journey to Medina in motor vehicles during the non-pilgrimage season were as follows :—- For Saudi subjects— £ Gold. , Koshan from Mecca to Medina and back ... ... ... 1 Motor hire for the above journey ... 11 For foreigners— Koshan from Mecca to Medina and back ... ... ... 2 Motor hire for the above journey ... ... ... ... 2 The total charges payable by a Saudi subject for the above journey were £2^ gold; by a foreigner £4 gold.22 (10) Indian Pilgrimage. 124. The Indian pilgrimage began this year with the arrival of the steam ship Islami on the 13th November, 1935, and arrivals ended with the steamship Alzbar on the 27th February, 1936. 125. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India and from Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation :— British Subjects. Province. Total Number of Pilgrims in 1935. In 1936. Bombay. Karachi. Calcutta. Total. Bengal and Assam 1,121 633 28 362 1,023 Punjab ... 2,537 64 2,273 2,337 Bombay Presidency 1,739 1,004 53 1,057 United Provinces 1,579 856 368 7 1,231 Madras Presidency 316 181 1 182 Sind Province 870 1 866 867 Behar and Orissa 266 250 8 4 262 Central Provinces 820 292 68 360 Beluchistan 226 17 352 369 N.W.

The discrepancy between the foregoing total and that given in paragraph 44 above is due to the fact that the figures in that paragraph include Indian pilgrims from embarkation ports other than those in India, and the present statement has been compiled from the lists of pilgrims sent to this post by the various Port Haj Committees in India, whereas those in paragraph 44 have been compiled from information supplied by the quarantine authorities. This table puts the total number of pilgrims from British India, the Native States, Ceylon and other foreign possessions in India at 8,487 (excluding 27 miscellaneous), as compared with 10,730 of last year. In order to facilitate comparison between the number of pilgrims this year and last, the figures for 1935 have also been shown in the above table. It would appear that the arrivals from each province of India, with the exception of Beluchistan, showed a slight decrease this year, whilst the Presidency of Bombay, Central Provinces and Hyderabad State (Deccan) showed considerable decreases in the year under review. 127. The following list shows the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports ;— Chinese (Turkestan), Chinese Afghans South Africans Russians (Turkestan) Persians Hejaz-Nejd subjects Malayans Arabs from Persian Gulf Tibetans Miscellaneous 1936. 1935. 383 1,668 3 3 4 272 2 44 6 7 2,392 Bombay. 33 77 16 1 106 3 22 7 14 279 Karachi.

Any difficulty in reconciling the foregoing figures with those in paragraph 44 above is due to causes similar to those indicated in paragraph 126 above. In order to facilitate comparison between the number of pilgrims this year and last, the figures for 1935 have also been added. Arrivals from Afghanistan showed a decrease, whilst a considerable increase is noticed in the number from Chinese Turkestan. It may also be noted that, besides the above number, a further 322 pilgrims from Chinese Turkestan arrived in the Hejaz by a Turkish steamer direct from Istanbul (reference paragraph 27 above). 129. According to information from the Deputy Naqib of Wakils at Jedda, the numbers of Indian pilgrims who arrived from other than Indian ports, as well as of those who left by other routes, were as follows :— Suez Port Sudan Aden ... South Africa ... Dutch East Indies and Malaya Zanzibar and East Africa ... Beirut Hodeida ... A rrivals. 89 29 17 13 11 13 Departures. 34 3 6 40 18 172 101 In addition to the above, about 200 Indian pilgrims arrived by motor vehicle overland from India via Iraq, and, with one or two exceptions, returned by the same route, and 635 on foot via Nejd, Yemen, Iraq and Palestine, who were repatriated eventually at the expense of the Government of India. 130. The Mogul Line fleet of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. was again the only line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. 131. The following table shows the movement of return traffic, with details of the number of ships available on given dates for repatriation of pilgrims, the number of pilgrims awaiting repatriation and the number actually repatriated :— Dates. Number of ships in port. Pilgrims awaiting embarkation. Pilgrims despatched. Pilgrims remaining. Remarks. 1936— March 12 4 3,963 1,637 2,326 Rizwani. March 14 ... 3 2,576 1,394 1,182 Khosrou.

Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of ships. voyages. pilgrims. ships. Voyages. pilgrims. 6 11 10,466 ( 5 ) 6 9 10,508 ( 6 ) Homeward to India. ( e ) The discrepancy between this figure of pilgrims arriving in the Hejaz and that given in Table (B) of paragraph 44 above is due to the difference between the Quarantine Department and the shipping company in the manner of their enumeration. The former includes all souls including infants, while the latter shows only the number for whom quarantine dues have to be paid. ( 6 ) This figure includes 662 destitutes, who came overland, &amp;c., but returned by steamer at the expense of the Government of India. There was also a number of pilgrims who came from India, during the non-pilgrimage season, and returned after the Haj : 547 return tickets are still held in deposit with this Legation.nnHHBP^ xu 24 133. The following table shows the distribution of the totals given in the preceding paragraph by ports of embarkation and destination. In the circum stances mentioned in paragraph 124 of the 1934 report, it has again been possible this year to give the exact number of pilgrims who returned to Bombay or Karachi :— Pilgrims Pilgrims Port. embarked. returning. Bombay 3,995 3,973 Karachi ... ... ... ... 6,081 6,535 Calcutta 390 10,466 10,508 134. The following is a statement of the number of pilgrims who purchased single and return tickets in India, or deposited the amount of return passage :— Port. Deposit. Single. Return. Total. Bombay 165 3,830 3,995 Karachi... 92 60 5,929 6,081 Calcutta 2 16 372 390 94 241 10,131 10,466 135. The remarks at paragraph 148 of last year's report regarding the desirability of encouraging pilgrims to avail themselves of the deposit system still apply. Karachi showed a welcome increase, being ninety-two as against twenty-two of last year. It is satisfactory to note that the number of single-ticket holders was again small, considering that the total of 241 includes mostly pilgrims travelling first or second-class. i Return of Pilgrims to India: General. 136. Although the number of arrivals this year from Indian ports was less by 2,633 than last year, arrangements made by the shipping company for the return journey occasioned some difficulty this year. On the sailing of steamship Ahhar on the 23rd March, 1936, 234 pilgrims were unable to obtain accommodation. They created a lot of trouble during the period of detention at Jedda. Steamship Alavi, which arrived a few days later, sailed from here on the 28th March, 1936, but unfortunately could not accommodate the total number of pilgrims waiting at Jedda, and accordingly on her sailing some 350 pilgrims were again left behind. They had to wait here for almost fifteen days for the steamship Islami. The latter was detained for twenty-four hours in the harbour, in the expectation of picking up further arrivals from the interior, but had to leave with about sixty-two pilgrims less than her capacity. Within a couple of days of her departure, however, 778 pilgrims arrived from Medina, and had to wait here for about fourteen or fifteen days for the steamship Alavi. Although there was detention of pilgrims at Jedda for about fifteen days on these two occasions, the company were not called upon to pay the detention allowance as the pilgrims embarked within the prescribed period. 137. As mentioned in paragraph 150 of the 1935 report, the Indian vice-consul was again confronted with persistent requests from all manner of ^ % pilgrims for the reservation of their passages by telegrams, &amp;c., in advance. As a contravention of the established rotation system would have been involved, these requests could not be acceded to, in justice to the rights of other pilgrims and in the interests of the shipping company. 138. The two homeward-bound voyages of steamship Islami proved a great convenience to first-class pilgrims, who were not greatly incommoded this year Four first-class pilgrims travelled voluntarily as second-class passengers by the steamship Jehangir on the 9th May, 1936, and four second-class pilgrims as deck passengers by the steamship Islami on the 17th March, the Islami having no second-class accommodation.139. Some difficulties were experienced this year on the arrival of pilgrim ships from India. On the outward journey pilgrims who had handed their heavy luggage to the shipping company for storage in the hold were granted metal discs as receipts. On arrival at Jedda difficulty was experienced, as no one was found to deliver luggage on presentation of the discs. All luggage was deposited on the quay, where the pilgrims helped themselves to their own property, with the result that many packages were lost. Food, Accommodation, &amp;c. 140. There is little change for the better to record this year over last {vide paragraph 154 of the 1935 report) in this respect, and Amirs-al-Haj, both on the outward and homeward voyages, had much fault to find with the food supply system. The introduction of the cabin food system for first and second-class pilgrims helped to reduce the grievances of these classes of pilgrims, although some of the first-class pilgrims on board the steamship Islami were not willing to take the cc cabin food ' supplied under the rules, and the master of the ship was good enough to arrange for their catering, without any extra charge, from the European food prepared for the crew. This privilege was also accorded to a few other pilgrims by the masters of one or two other pilgrim vessels. Apart from the food question, almost all Amirs-al-Haj and other leading pilgrims directed their criticisms, as last year, against baths and latrines, accommodation and storage of heavy luggage, attendants and doctors to be Moslems. Committee of Pilgrims, &amp;c. 141. (Paragraph 155 {a) of the 1935 report.) During this season Amirs-al-Haj replaced Committees of Pilgrims, in accordance with arrangements sanctioned by the Government of India. The shipping company's experience was that ' £ Committees of Pilgrims '' were less conducive to discipline on board ship and affected the authority of the master. Accordingly, pilgrim ships from Bombay or Karachi direct to Jedda had one Amir-al-IIaj on board, while those coming from both the ports had two Amirs-al-Haj, one appointed by each of the Port Haj Committees. In spite of the difficulty one man must have in dealing with so many pilgrims and their problems, the majority of the Amirs-al-Haj carried out their duties efficiently, furnishing valuable reports on the working of the system and suggesting improvements. One criticism, however, was made by certain pilgrims against one or two Amirs-al-Haj, appointed from amongst deck-class pilgrims, for their having been granted first or second-class cabins, special food and attention, without extra charge. In fact, one Amir-al-Haj compiled a report of a few lines only, and that devoted to appreciation of the ship's staff and the catering company. 142. On return voyages the Legation also appointed one or two Amirs-al- Haj, as the case arose, on board the homeward-bound pilgrim vessels. Care was taken as far as possible to make the appointments from first or second-class pilgrims, though on some occasions it was difficult to adhere strictly to this principle in view of the dearth of English-speaking pilgrims. 143. Amirs-al-Haj did not again confine themselves in their reports to the duties required of them by the terms of their letter of appointment (para graph 155 {c) of the 1935 report). The reports were, as usual, larded with suggestions for improvement which comes within the scope of the new Pilgrim Ships Rules and the Merchant Shipping Act. Pilgrim Passes. 144. Difficulties were again experienced in handling the existing form of pilgrim passes, especially during the height of the season. The Indian section of the Legation issued 123 duplicate passes to pilgrims, who had lost their original pilgrim passes, and a further 604 emergency passes to those who travelled overland on foot or who had remained in the Hejaz for more than two years and had lost their pilgrim passes. Refunds on Defosit-Paid Passes and Return Tickets. 145. The system, mentioned in paragraph 142 of the 1934 report, was again followed and proved of great help to pilgrims concerned, who were not required to wait for months as in the past. Some question, however, arose in respect of [13777] e26 the procedure of obtaining refunds on return tickets. At the close of the season the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs raised unofficial objections to the require ment that return tickets of non-British subjects should be presented to this Legation for endorsement under section 208 (c) of Indian Merchant Shipping Act, on refund being claimed, the Ministry being inclined to contend that the local shipping agents should have the full authority to refund the amount of return tickets, belonging to non-Indians, without reference to this Legation. The matter had not recently been pursued further at the time of writing, but may be so later. Registration. 146. The Legation arrangements continued to work satisfactorily, and 8,243 Indian pilgrims of the 8,439 shown in Table (A) of paragraph 44 above as having arrived by sea, registered at this Legation, the deficit being accounted for by the reasons mentioned in paragraph 143 of the 1934 report. 147. Thirty-eight unclaimed or unused return tickets or deposit-paid passes of 1935 are still lying in the custody of this Legation. They will be forwarded to the Port Haj Committee, Bombay, in one batch after the expiry of a period of eighteen months from the date of issue of the last of each season's batch. This amended procedure has proved of great utility and convenience to pilgrims in claiming refunds under article 209 (2) of the amended Indian Merchant Shipping- Act, 1933, and, administratively, to the Legation itself. 148. Six Indian pilgrims who had not deposited their return tickets at this Legation and fourteen foreign pilgrims reported the loss of their return tickets. Arrangements similar to those described in paragraph 179 of the 1932 report were made for all cases to enable them to obtain passages. Local Haj Committee. 149. It will be recalled that in 1927 the Indian pilgrimage officer was able to inaugurate a Haj Committee, with the assistance of the then Kaimakam of Jedda, with a view to controlling the booking of pilgrims for their homeward journey. An account of this committee was given at pp. 8 and 9 of the annual pilgrimage report for 1927. This committee again worked in 1928, details of which will be found at pp. 12 and 13 of the report of that year. The committee functioned thereafter each year as usual, and carried out its work satisfactorily till 1935, as may be seen from annual pilgrimage reports, although on two occasions there were reasons for doubting its permanency. 150. The situation underwent a sudden change at the close of the pilgrimage of 1936. Intrigues in which Ismail Ghuznavi and others were concerned eventually succeeded in bringing about the abolition of a most useful pilgrimage organisation. Although after the pilgrimage, the Saudi Government at first allowed the formation of the committee, as usual, they suddenly recalled their representatives and instructed them not to sit on the committee. The Indian vice-consul was left alone with the representative of the shipping agents to arrange the departure of the remaining pilgrims, two homeward-bound vessels having been already dealt with by the committee before it broke up. The apprehension of such a development had been felt since 1932, and consequently section 137 of Indian Pilgrim Ships Rules, 1933, proved of great help, as was expected, in dealing with the situation. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah therefore found no difficulty in coping with the situation, and was even able to see advantages before the work was completed, in that the greater opportunity for devoting personal attention enabled the work to be carried out more efficiently. 151. Special care was taken this year to warn pilgrims not to pay any gratuity to mutawwifs' wakils, &amp;c., for accommodation on board ships obtained in preference to the rightful claimants. Efforts were made to bring home to them that pilgrims are booked in accordance with the strict order of their arrival in Jedda after the Haj, and no departure from this rotation system is permissible. Hyderabad State Caravan. 152. The newly appointed Director of the Ecclesiastical Department of the Nizam's Government effected a very useful reform in the State pilgrimage by doing away with the monopoly of a single mutawwif. The system of appointing only one mutawwif for the whole caravan (consisting of 736 pilgrims in 1935) was one under which the interests of the poorer classes of pilgrims in the party27 were apt to suffer. The mutawwif used to extend hospitality and personal service to well-to-do pilgrims, whereas poorer pilgrims were often neglected. This year, therefore, the Hyderabad caravan was not confined to one mutawwif. On the conclusion of the pilgrimage, Nawab Sir Nizamat Jung, the late Political Secretary of the Nizam's Government, who is unofficially interested in State pilgrimage and other affairs in the Hejaz connected with the State, made private enquiries from the Indian vice-consul of his views regarding the change referred to above. In reply, Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah welcomed the reform, but pointed out that if the pilgrims in the caravan were divided amongst a large number of mutawwifs, the leader of the caravan would find it impossible to cater for the caravan and arrange for their accommodation at Arafat and Muna, besides being hampered in leading a well-organised party to Medina and Jedda. The Nizam s Government would be advised, he suggested, to select three mutawwifs at the most for the caravan, thereby leaving no opportunity for other mutawwifs to bargain with the State pilgrims. The selected mutawwifs should be required to follow the rules and regulations which the Ecclesiastical Department of the State may frame to organise the journeys, &amp;c., in the Hejaz under the leadership of the ' Kafila Salar,' and strictly to comply with the latter's instructions both in Bombay and on board the ships. It was also advisable, he said, that the Kafila Salar ' of the State Caravan should not be changed every year if possible. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah reported in terms of warm appreciation of the work done by the ' Kafila Salar ' this year, both in the organisation of his caravan, and in his collaboration with the Indian vice-consul in his work. Destitutes. 153. There was, unfortunately, an increase in the number of destitutes this year over 1935, the figures being 662 as against 562. The number of those who came overland was again greater in proportion to the total, being 617 out of 662. The following table gives an analysis of the figures for this year by (a) provinces of origin, and {h) routes of access to the Hejaz : — {a) Provinces of origin— Bengal Sind ...

The authorities in India were again able to get a quotation of 40 rupees a eaa, excluding food and conveyance charges, direct from Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co., for the repatriation of destitutes. A sum of 780 rupees was collected from twenty-three of the individuals repatriated, who seemed able to contribute, m part, to the cost of their return. The actual amount expended od benair ot the Government of India was 30,820-8 rupees. .^ e , us ual precautions were taken to guard against fraud, to provide the authorities m India with the lists of the persons repatriated, and to take from eacn an undertaking to repay the money expended. 156. It was apparent in the light of the figures of destitutes travelling overland across Arabia cited above, that measures have still to be devised to stem this most undesirable movement. The Saudi Arab Government in November last refused to allow some 500 Indian destitute pilgrims to proceed further than Hasa where they had arrived en route for Mecca and the Government of India with the co-operation of the authorities in Bahrein, were eventually able to repatriate them to India. The attention of the Government of India was again invited to this question m order that a repetition of this incident may be avoided and ' ' indeed, the number of destitutes generally be reduced. ' Publicity. 157. {Vide paragraph 168 of the 1935 report.) The Bombav Port Hai Committee again published the Manual of Instructions for Pilgrims to the Heiaz for the year under review, but its issue was, however, delayed. Comment was r w y t P nf g T S • 0n . the ; nnovatl T on of including advertisements, interleaved ^th the text of the instructions. It was stated that it would be better if the advertisements were placed together at the end of the manual.

(11) Afghan Pilgrimage. 161. There was a decrease in the number of Afghan pilgrims, in the year under review, being 1,498, as against 1,707 last year. 162. Out of 1,498 Afghans, who travelled to the Hejaz by the sea route, 1,107 came via Indian ports and the remaining 391 via Suez. It shows that they are now developing an increasing tendency to visit the other Holy Places of Islam in Iraq and Palestine. Although the number of Afghan pilgrims was less by 209 than the previous year, the number of those who travelled to the Hejaz by sea, other than from the Indian ports, increased from nineteen to 391 this year. All those who came from Indian ports were either return-ticket holders or deposit-paid pilgrims. Of those who travelled by sea via Suez or by overland routes via Nejd, &amp;c., no less than twelve cases of destitutes came to the notice of this Legation, through their endeavours to pass themselves off as British subjects and so be repatriated at Government of India expense. The Afghan Minister at Jedda as usual paid little attention to them, and eventually the cost of the passages of thirty-three Afghan destitutes in all was borne by local charity. 163. During the year the Afghan Minister here ceased to represent his Government in Egypt, closed the Legation in Cairo, and took up his permanent residence at Jedda. He was stated not to have concerned himself unduly with questions affecting the welfare of Afghan pilgrims. He considered it unnecessary to depute a representative to sit on the local Haj Committee, declaring his faith in the Indian vice-consul's impartiality in operating the rotation system, no preference being given to Indians over the non-Indians. Muhammad Sadiq-al- Mujaddidi, on the other hand, did a disservice not only to his own nationals, but to Indian pilgrims also, by protesting to the Saudi Government against the prevailing arrangements for recovering transport charges from pilgrims visiting Medina from Jedda direct, a protest which ultimately led to the imposition of the extra amount, referred to in paragraph 118 above. After the Haj, the Afghan Minister intended to spend the summer at Taif, and rented a house there without assuring himself that the Saudi Government would allow him to reside there. It was eventually occupied by a relative of Amir Feisal, and in reply to his protests the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed him that, though members of foreign missions could visit Taif for short periods, they were not allowed to take permanent residence there. He subsequently retired to Egypt to spend the summer, leaving behind a clerk in charge of the Legation. 164. A new doctor, named Noor Muhammad (an Indian), was deputed this year as medical mission from Afghanistan. He arrived at Jedda on the 21st January and left for India on the 23rd March, 1936, having carried out his duties until after the Haj. He earned an excellent reputation for his diligence in visiting free of charge patients of all nationalities. 165. No notable Afghans came on Haj this year. It was rumoured that ex-King Amanullah was to visit the Hejaz again this year, and the visit of Mir Rahmatullah Humayun, a Punjabi by origin, who was formerly private secretary to the ex-King, to this country during the pilgrimage season was made on the chance of meeting the ex-King. (12) Malayan Pilgrimage. Shipping {Outward from Malayan Ports). 166. The season under review commenced with the sailing of the steamship Teiresias of the Blue Funnel Line from Singapore on the 13th October, carrying 557 pilgrims, and with its arrival at Jedda on the 1st November, 1935. Three other ships followed, all of the same company, and altogether they carried a total number of 1,881 pilgrims, who consisted of not only British (Malayan), but also, as usual, Dutch (Javanese), American (Philippines), Chinese and Saudi Arab nationalities. It might be mentioned that pilgrims from Colombo (Ceylon) were also included in the above total, and this for the first time.30 Number of Pilgrims. 167. The number of registered pilgrims from British Malaya was 906, composed as follows :— Straits Settlements— Singapore 37 Penang and Province Wellesley ... ... 53 Malacca ... ... ... ... ... ... 12 Labuan ... ... ... ... ... ... 0 Federated Malay States— Perak Selangor ... Pahang ... Negri Sembilan Unfederated Malay States— Johore Kedah Kelantan ... Trengganu Brunei Perlis Total 131 40 48 72 168 92 190 62 1 0 906 168. This total is an increase of 47 per cent, on last year, when the number was 617. The Malay pilgrimage officer considers that had it not been for the Italo-Abyssinian conflict, with its attendant uncertainties, the number of pilgrims might have been larger than it actually was. In any case, it is satisfactory to note that the improvement which has been evident over the past three years has been maintained this year. Issue of Pilgrim Passes and Tickets. 169. Haji Abdul Majid reports that the issue of 'collective' pilgrim passes i.e., passes containing the names of more than one pilgrim, became more general this season. He again deprecates this practice as causing complications not only m registering these pilgrims in the Legation at Jedda, but also in carrying out the necessary formalities with the Saudi Arab Government when cases ot death occur or when, for example, one of the pilgrims on a ' collective ' pass wished to return home while another wished to stay on in the Heiaz 170. As regards the issue of single tickets, two found this season, an improvement over last year (vide paragraph 180 of last year's report). Charges and Cost of Pilgrimage. 171 The general nature and effects of the Saudi pilgrimage tariff are aeain discussed m a separate section of this report. The approximate rate of exchange 801,1 = 1 ' lTO ° '■ 50 st ~' ■&gt;'«'' '&lt;1 ' 172. The cost of a return ticket Singapore-Jedda, inclusive of quarantine dues was the same as last year viz., 181 dollars. Haji Abdul Maiid estimates that the minimum cost of the pilgrimage for the Malay pilgrim was (a)To Mecca only—about 340 Straits dollars (&amp;) To Mecca and Medina-about 400 Straits dollars, exclusive, in both cases of cost of maintenance whilst in the Hejaz. Mutawwifs. -.r}]?- Several cases of overcharging by mutawwifs were successfullv settled with the co-operation of the head mutawwif in Mecca Sheikh Hamid A M I Mannan. The case of Sheikh Abdullah Rawa Dara'orfmli i t , report) has not been pursued by the Sandi aXrits^foSe t me As a Sit of this case, however, Haji Abdul Maiid reports that fhp o ^ taken steps to prevent mntawwifs of littleTno suLtance from WTnf 5 haVe paid as advances by Malay pilgrims When snnh prh™™ handling money received by the heaiof the^dla31 mutawwif for Javanese and Malays in Mecca, who doles money out to the mutawwifs concerned as and when required. Haji Abdul Majid also reports that in Malaya notices have been issued by the Government warning intending pilgrims not to make advance payments to mutawwifs before reaching the Hejaz. General Conditions during the Pilgrimage Season. 174. These again have been treated fairly fully in other parts of this report. Haji Abdul Majid refers more particularly to the fact that the prices of food-stuffs and water remained about the same as in last year, so that pilgrims did not pay exorbitantly high prices during the season. He again alludes to the general security of the country for purposes of travelling, but mentions that the number of thieves seemed to have increased, particularly during Haj days at Arafat. One or two cases were reported where the victims were assaulted and even killed. Happily, writes Haji Abdul Majid, these victims were not Malays. 175. Torrential rains of extraordinary violence occurred during the season (already noted at paragraph 23 above), and in one case the route to Medina in certain parts was flooded, causing cars and caravans to be swept away. There were some fatalities among pilgrims, but here again fortunatelv the victims were not Malays. Hostels for Students in Mecca. 176. The managing committee of the new school, ' Darul-'Ulum' uddiniyah,' referred to in paragraph 187 of this report for last, season, decided to send a deputation to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies for the purpose of collecting donations from well-wishers towards the building of a school house and a hostel for the students, who, by the way, have increased from 100 in number, when the school started last year, to more than 400 this year. Mortality. 177. The total number of deceased pilgrims among Malays who arrived this season, as reported to the Malay pilgrimage officer up to the 5th April, 1936, was twenty-seven. This approximated to 3 per cent, of the total number of arrivals, and compared with last year, when the percentage of deaths was per cent., was slightly higher. Effects of Deceased Pilgrims. 178. (Vide paragraph 193 of the 1935 report.) A reply was at last received by the Legation from the Saudi Arab Government to the effect that the effects of (1) Abdul Eahman-bin-Tambi, and (2) Abu Seman-bin-Mat Noh, two deceased pilgrims from Province Wellesley, were lost trace of after they had been handed over to the official of the Beyt-al-Mal at Jedda, who committed suicide some time in 1932. V A ssistance to Pilgrims. 179. Pecuniary assistance was withheld during this season as the few applicants were those who had been warned that they would not be repatriated by the Legation if they sold their tickets. It was observed that these individuals succeeded in getting assistance from their friends. 180. One case of loss of luggage, whilst being handled by the servant of a certain sheikh, was also successfully dealt with, and refund therefor obtained, thanks to the system of the black list maintained by the Legation. Notabilities 1 from Malaya. 181 Fewer notables from Malaya came on pilgrimage this season than usual. They included :— Inche Busu (Yusuf)-bin-Noh, a Trengganu civil servant; Tuan Haji Mohammad-bin-Haji Hasan, a philanthropist from Malacca. 182. A British convert to Islam, Mr. G. T. M. MacBryan (Moslem name, Abdur Rahman), formerly in the service of the Government of Sarawak, arrived at Jedda via Egypt in January 1936. He managed to have an audience of Ibn Saud, and, after considerable delay in Jedda, permission was granted to him to enter the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina on the 1st March, two days prior to the Assemblage at Arafat.y*- 32 Miscellaneous. 183. Haji Abdul Majid reports that several cases of houses being bought recently by Malays for Wakf purposes came to notice. It was stated that as the donors had not had them registered with the Committee for Wakfs, as required by Saudi law, the houses were being used by interested persons for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. 184. A sum of £152 7^. 4 g ?. was received by the Legation towards the end of 1935 from Sungei Ujong, Seremban, for distribution amongst the poor and needy of Medina. After consultation with the Government of the Straits Settle ments, this money was officially remitted to the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs for disposal by the authorities. No information as to the manner of its disposal had been received at the time of writing. Staff. 185. The Malay pilgrimage officer, Haji Abdul Majid, arrived at Jedda on the 1st November, 1935, and left, not by the last pilgrim ship of the season ^ on the 5th April, through unavoidable circumstances, but on the 26th April, 1936. He was satisfactorily assisted by Haji Muhammad Jamil throughout that period. (13) West A frican Pilgrimage. 186. Statistics published by the Saudi authorities show that 2,550 West Africans arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year. They are, as usual, described in the return under the somewhat vague heading of ' Takrunis,' a loose term applied locally to all natives of West Africa, irrespective of nationality. No figures are given for West Africans who disembarked at the ports of Qunfida and Lith this year, although it is known by the Legation that at least two dhows, carrying between them 250 odd West Africans, arrived at Qunfida from Massawa. Although it is impossible to estimate with accuracy the percentage of British or British-protected persons included in the above figure, it may be assumed that they do not exceed more than 65 per cent, of the total. 187. The position with regard to dhow traffic from Massawa was still difficult to estimate, but military activity in Eritrea due to the Italo-Abyssinian , war would appear to have caused a diminution in a traffic which, however, still goes on. According to one informant no restrictions were placed in the way of Mecca-bound pilgrims. 188. Up to the time of writing this report no applications for repatriation have been received. With the development of the operations of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, Limited, the labour market has become much healthier with a steady demand for cheap labour. 189. In the light of the past two seasons the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme 1.8 not enjoying the measure of success it deserves. This year only twenty-six pilgrims travelled under its auspices as compared with fifty-eight last vear and sixty-nme in 1934. By the 14th April all pilgrims, who had travelled under this scheme, had collected their return tickets and the sums due to them and all but one had left the country by the 15th June, 1936. (14) Somali Pilgrimage. 190. This year Saudi returns differentiate between Somalis and Eritreans, and under this heading 403 pilgrims are shown as having arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage, as compared with thirty-seven last year. It is estimated that not more than a third of them were British-protected persons. A small number of availably 0 S OVerland ' but ' as llsua1 ' 110 fi g ures regarding them are w ^TV f Thl f S nffi ar t ^D irt u en Somal1 ? travelled on official pilgrim passes, issued of Ms d^posTt Berbera J one of whom applied for and received the refund 192.

' 033 % (15) Sudanese Pilgrimage. 193. According to Saudi quarantine returns 1,195 Sudanese pilgrims entered the country through the port of Jedda this year, an increase of 329 on last year's figure. They were, as usual, carried to and from the Sudan in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. Emergency certificates were issued to a number of pilgrims who had lost their travel documents, and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) were again good enough to provide them with free steamer tickets. 194. This year the Saudi authorities appear to have agreed to standardise mutawwifs' dues at £1 gold 31-J piastres, fixed for collection purposes at £E. 2-150 mms., for all Sudanese pilgrims who arrived at Jedda via Suakin, irrespective of whether they came from town or countryside (see paragraph 203 of the report for 1933). This sum is half the full mutawwifs' dues which are scheduled at £2 gold 63 piastres. The reason given for fixing the rate at £E. 2 150 mms. was that in previous years mutawwifs had experienced great difficulty in collecting full dues from those who were scheduled to pay them, and in the large majority of cases had to be satisfied with what they could get, which was usually a sum in the neighbourhood of £E. 2. 195. In spite of the reduction described in the previous paragraph, the Legation was again inundated during the return season by pilgrims requiring monetary assistance. After careful elimination, 58 pilgrims were each advanced the sum of £E. 1 • 500 mms. In most cases the loans were required to tide pilgrims over the waiting period between homeward-bound ships. Following corres pondence with this Legation the Sudan Government this year agreed to fix the sum of £E. 1 • 500 mms. as a standard loan, and furnished a supply of printed receipt forms, which, coupled with the adoption of the suggestion that the Suakin authorities should insert the markaz and province of the Sudanese bearer of the Suakin Pilgrim Pass, has simplified considerably the clerical work hitherto involved in this connexion. 196. Shipping arrangements during the return season were again far from satisfactory. Numerous complaints were lodged by pilgrims who, financially embarrassed, had to wait from fourteen to twenty days for a homeward-bound ship. The first Khedivial sailing from Jedda to Suakin after the Haj (4th March) was on the 14th March; the next ship left fourteen days later on the 28th March. 197. A notable who performed the pilgrimage this year was Barakat Ghuwinim, Omda of Eashayda, accompanied by 134 followers. He returned to the Sudan with 130 followers on the Khedivial mail steamer which left Jedda on the 14th March, 1936. 198. During* the return season fifteen Sudanese pilgrims arrived from Medina suffering from small-pox, ten of whom were admitted to the Government hospital at Jedda, where nine of them died. The other five cases were treated locally, and eventually recovered. All those who recovered have since returned to the Sudan {vide paragraph 52 above under ' Quarantine '). This question was the subject of subsequent correspondence between the Legation and the Sudan Government. 199. One Sudanese pilgrim, Haj Merghani Ali Bilal, of Tangar, near Shellal, is reported to have lost his life in the floods which occurred on the Medina road between Rabigh and Medina during the month of Ramadhan (see para graph 23 above). He was buried by the local authorities at Rabigh, 200. Repatriation of Sudanese; position on the 15th June, 1936 :— (а) Applications deserving of consideration (б) Applicants repatriated ... (c) Applications still under reference 2 1 Nil (16) Zanzihari and East A frican Pilgrimages. 201. Saudi returns show that twenty-five pilgrims entered the country via the port of Jedda this year, a decrease of 114 on last year's figure of 139. 202. A notable who performed the pilgrimage this year was Mr. Abdul Wahid, O.B.E., a member of the council, Kenya Colony. 203. No Zanzibari or East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. [13777] F34 (17) South A frican Pilgrimage. 204. According to Saudi returns, forty-two South African pilgrims entered the country via the port of Jedda on pilgrimage this year, as compared with fifty-nine last year. Most of them were of Indian extraction, and people of means who required no other assistance than the endorsement of their passports. 205. No South African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (18) Palestinian and Transjvrdan Pilgrimage. 206. According to official returns published by the Saudi quarantine authorities, 770 Palestinian and Transjordan pilgrims entered the country through the ports of Yanbu and Jedda, a decrease of 662 on last year's figures. 207. As the number of registered pilgrims exceeded 500 (see paragraph 205 of the report for 1934), the Government of Palestine seconded Wasfi Aret Abdul Hadi, a clerical officer of the Palestine Health Department, for service with this Legation for a period of six weeks. He arrived in Jedda on the 1st March and proceeded direct to Mecca on pilgrimage, returning to take up his duties at the Legation on the morning of the 12th March. Although the clerical work in connexion with this section of the pilgrimage was considerably lighter this year than in 1935, Wasfi Aret Effendi performed his duties with great efficiency, and to the entire satisfaction of the officer under whom he worked. He left for Palestine on the 15th April. 208. During the return season fifty-one pilgrims were each advanced the sum of £4, and two pilgrims, owing to exceptional circumstances, were each advanced the sum of £4 10^. This year applications were received from four pilgrims alleged to be destitute at Yanbu, requesting that refunds of their deposits be made to their mutawwif at Jedda, who would transmit the money to them. To obviate possible hardship the refunds were made. The pro-consul calls attention to the apparent increase in the popularity of Yanbu as a port of embarkation for pilgrims homeward bound from Medina, and the possibility of similar applications in future. 209. This year an attempt was made to regularise the overland route via Ma'an and Tebuk, and also via Jauf. Twenty-three pilgrims, all of whom were in possession of regular passports, who had travelled on the Ma'an-Tebuk route, called at the Legation and asked for assistance, but when informed that their cases would have to be referred to the Government of Palestine, decided to return whence they came. According to their statements, the authorities at Tebuk had levied dues ranging from £1 gold to £5 gold, the actual amount payable depending it would seem, on the apparent means of the pilgrim. Only one pilgrim, a Transjordanian, who had used the Jauf route came to the notice of the Legation. 210. Shipping arrangements again worked smoothly, and no complaints were received from Palestinian pilgrims. 211. Repatriation of Palestinians and Transjordanians :— {a) Applications deserving of consideration ... ... 2 (&amp;) Applicants repatriated ... ... Nil (c) Applications still under reference ... ... ... Nil (19) Pilgrimages of Adenese and Natives of the Aden Protectorate. 212. According to Saudi returns, 404 Hadhramis and natives of the Aden Protectorate arrived in Jedda this year on pilgrimage, and forty-eight Hadhramis are shown as having landed at the port of Lith. No figures are available regarding those who came overland. 213. The number of emergency travel documents issued during the return season to Hadhramis of the semi-settled class was relatively small (see para graph 224 of last year's report). During the period under review only 155 such documents have been issued, as compared with 212 over a similar period last year and 270 in 1934. 214. Shipping arrangements on the whole worked smoothly this year. A few complaints were received from pilgrims who had booked return passages on Besse steamers. These were satisfactorily dealt with when the local agents made refunds which enabled the recipients to take passages on steamers of the Turner, Morrison Line.y\ J 2X A 35 215.

Under the heading ' Muscat and Persian Gulf,' Saudi returns show that 107 pilgrims arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year, and fifty are shown as having landed at the port of Lith, an increase of sixty-eight on last year's recorded total of eighty-seven. 217. Two Bahreinis were officially reported by Saudi Government to the Legation to have been drowned in floods near Rabigh a little while before the pilgrimage {vide paragraph 23 above). 218. No figures are given in the returns regarding those who came overland. But according to the ' Koweit Intelligence Summary,' No. 4 of 1936, 202 Koweitis proceeded on pilgrimage this year by the overland route : 198 by camel and 4 by car. 219. Bahreini notables who performed the pilgrimage this year were Abdulla and Hassan, sons of Muhammad A1 Khalifa, relatives of the Sheikh of Bahrein. ... 220. No Muscati, Bahreini or Koweiti pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (21) Sarawak Pilgrimage. 221. The manager of the Jedda branch of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Limited), who acts as Sarawak pilgrimage officer, reports a heavy increase of fourteen from Sarawak performed the pilgrimage this year. This figure probably includes an Islamised Briton, Mr. Gerard Truman Magill MacBryan. ah ex-official of the Sarawak Government, and a recent convert to Islam under the name of Abdur Rahman (vide paragraph 182 above). *THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S uV?.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the annual report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz for 1937. ^ 2. As I did not reach this post till nearly two months after pilgrimage day, I have no personal knowledge of the events described. I have had the advantage, however, of being supplied with most careful and elaborate reports from the Indian vice-consul and pilgrimage officer, Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, from the Indian medical officer. Dr. Abdul Hamid, from Mr. Ousman, pro-consul, and from Eaji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer. I have prepared my report almost entirely from information supplied by them. I have been careful to adhere strictly to the general lines of the previous report. 3. As this is, unfortunately, the last occasion on which that energetic and indomitable officer. Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah, will appear as a contributor to this report, I should like to take this opportunity once more to draw your atten tion and that of the Government of India to his signal services. Throughout the whole of his eleven years' service at this post he has shown great zeal in upholding the interests of pilgrims against the many authorities and individuals here who thrive on exploiting them; he has been a veritable malleus mutowwiforma; and he has now retired, leaving it to his successor to carry on the hard struggle. 4.

THE political situation of Saudi Arabia during the year ending with the 1937 pilgrimage was very peaceful and satisfactory. King Ibn Saud, disturbed by no internal insurrections, was able to cement his friendly relations with the Yemen, Iraq and Egypt, and to further the cause of Arab brotherhood. The visits of three sons of the Imam of Yemen on pilgrimage, the visit of the Iraqi Foreign Minister to Riyadh, and the subsequent journey of an Iraqi deputation to Mecca, followed by the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Bagdad, were all factors in this consolidation of interests. 2. The Treaty of Friendship with Egypt was a great triumph. Following on a visit to Egypt by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Talaat Pasha Harb was able to carry out a vast propaganda in Egypt, urging the faithful by broadcast appeals to perform the pilgrimage. The delicate question of the ' mahmul' was also the subject of propaganda by Talaat Pasha, and the President of the Egyptian Senate, Basyuni Bey, accompanied the sacred carpet in person to the Hejaz on its first visit for many years. The reception of the sacred carpet at Jedda was more in accordance with the Wahhabi tenet that it is just an ordinary framework of wood covered by a carpet than with Egyptian ideas. Ibn Saud appears to have scored a diplomatic victory; the number of Egyptian pilgrims was about double last year's figure. 3. Saudi propaganda for the pilgrimage was not confined to broadcasts in Egypt. An army of 'mutawwifs' was despatched to Moslem countries. A good deal of broadcasting was done in Java. Ismail Ghuznavi, the Indian agitator, employed the medium of the wireless for the first time this year, when he broadcast a sermon on the Haj from Delhi. World events in Abyssinia and Spain also brought grist to the Saudi mill; for the new self-styled ' Protector of Islam ' caused about 2,000 Abyssinians and Somalis from Italian Somaliland to be sent on pilgrimage with a Government subsidy. General Franco followed suit and sent a Spanish pilgrim ship from Morocco. The visit of the Chief Priest of the Bohra community from India resulted in an increase in the number of Bohra pilgrims from 300 in the previous year to 1,500 this year. The 25 per cent, reduction in pilgrimage tariff dues, announced first in 1936, was continued this year, though (as explained later in this report) it did not reduce the total cost of the pilgrimage by that percentage. A special Government department of propaganda, directed by an ex-Minister of Education, Sheikh Ibrahim Shura, and housed in an office on the main road opposite the Haram at Mecca, was inaugurated; mutawwifs were specially instructed to induce leading pilgrims to visit that office, where they were entertained and told of the glories of the reign of King Ibn Saud. It is known that a sum of about 10,000 rupees was received by Ismail Ghuznavi in April 1937; this is believed to represent Ibn Saud's annual subsidy for propaganda in India. Interpreters and translators of Indian and Javanese languages were busily engaged in the great work. Better economic conditions in Malaya and Java resulted in a striking increase in pilgrims from those countries. All these causes assisted in raising the total number of overseas pilgrims from 32,423 last year to 49,957 this year. 4. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhul Hijjah, fell this year on Saturday, the 20th February. The concourse on Arafat numbered no less than 80,000 pilgrims. Yemenis were perhaps the only class of pilgrim whose numbers did not come up to last year's figure; the attack on the King's life in 1935 caused the Saudi authorities to take precautionary measures, as to the entry of Yemenis, and the negotiations with the Yemen to allow pilgrims from that country to attend the pilgrimage without paying taxes were much delayed, so that only a few Yemenis came on pilgrimage at the last moment. 5. Climatic conditions this year were again excellent. The general health of the pilgrims was exceptionally good. Showers of rain at Muna incommoded some of the poorer classes of pilgrims, but lowered the temperature. 6. The measures taken last year to protect the King during his circumambu- lation and the ceremony called Sai ' were similar to those reported last year (paragraph 7 of the 1936 report). Certain pious theologians, incommoded by such interference from the secular arm, expressed the view that it was contrarv to the Moslem religion. 7. The general economic condition of the country remained unchanged The increased revenue from the large number of pilgrims did not appear to findits way into the disbursing channels, as salaries of Saudi officials remained in arrear. The Motor Transport Company, however, flourished. A good fall of rain in November later supplied cultivators with satisfactory crops. Among economic factors, the following may be specially noted :— {a) The California Arabian Standard Oil Company continued to employ a good many men on the other side of the peninsula in Hasa. (&amp;) The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate did the same in various parts of the Hejaz. (c) Egyptian engineers, teachers, and other specialists were despatched to the Hejaz as a result of the closer relations consequent upon the new treaty with Egypt. (d) The Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Company (Limited) commenced operations in certain areas along the Red Sea, thereby causing a certain amount of employment. 8. The Nizam of Hyderabad's scheme for repairs to the cemeteries in Mecca and Medina, the Medina water supply, a new library on the spot where the prophet was born, the paving of the Ka'ba, and other works, was estimated to cost 11,52,800 rupees; the whole scheme is still under consideration in the Ministry of Finance. 9. The ' piastre project ' (paragraph 9 of the last report) was pursued this year with greater zeal, especially during Hamadhan, and pilgrims, when leaving Medina, were asked to contribute 1 piastre towards this fund. 10. No shortage of currency was reported this year. The English gold pound remained the ultimate criterion, and represented 20 riyals, more or less. 11. Funds for the Aeronautical Society were, as usual, raised in various ways. Pressure was brought to bear upon some pilgrims to contribute a rupee to this fund. Saudi officials were announced to have surrendered one month's salary to the fund. The truth appears to be that they had given up all hope of ever getting that month paid, and so agreed to its being absorbed by the Aeronautical Society, on the understanding that they would receive subsequent months more punctually, a hope which was not realised. 12. The Banque Misr opened this year an air service between Jedda and Medina, and a number of pilgrims availed themselves of it. The fare was £18 gold return, half of which represented the Government ' f koshan '' tax. 13. As for the Saudi exiles, mentioned in paragraph 12 of the last report, it is reported that the last of them, named Sheikh Bakri Gazaz, returned to the Hejaz this year. 14. Indian propagandists were again prominent. Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan was somewhat eclipsed by his rival, Ismail Ghuznavi. The latter declared that the former was a British spy. As a result, Muhammad Khan not only had no influence on the King, but lost what influence he had had with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. Ghoudhury Muhammad Amin still appeared to enjoy the confidence of the Saudi authorities, and is said to have received a refund of 2,000 rupees on account of travelling expenses. Ismail Ghuznavi continued his policy of opposition to all British interference with pilgrims, and more especially to the work of the Indian vice-consul. It was largely due to him that the mutawwifs and their wakils refused to co-operate in the Local Haj Committee this year. A deputation of the ' Khaksar ' Society visited the Hejaz during this pilgrimage under the presidency of U.M. Ghani of Rangoon, but appear to have cut very little ice. Moulana Mazhar-ud-Din of the El A man paper of Delhi, is said to have received Saudi money and various facilities. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, as was foreshadowed in the last report, turned more than ever to the Egyptians instead of to the Indians. During an interview granted by him to Miss Fatmah, an inspectress of schools at Bombay and her brother, editor of the Indian vernacular paper Paisa Akhhar of Lahore, he praised the Egyptians, who, he said, had raised £40,000 for the Hejaz, whereas the Indians had done little but 15. Saudi -Egyptian relations have been mentioned above. A number of distinguished Egyptians were transported to Egypt by the Banque Misr aero planes this year; they had to undergo quarantine at Tor. The Banque Misr Navigation Company again provided two large barges for the conveyance of their [15823] B 24 pilgrims between ship and shore, an improvement which was very popular with the pilgrims from Egypt. It would perhaps be worth Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co.'s while to arrange to borrow these barges for the comfort of their pilgrims from India when the ship anchors in the outer harbour owing to rough seas. The Bank Misr Hotel at Medina is not yet ready, but at Jedda a newly-built hotel has been rented by them from Messrs. Haji Abdullah Alireza, with a charge of £1 Egyptian per day; their old hotel, charging three-quarters that sum, is also still in use. A grand hotel at Mecca is said to be under construction by the Banque Misr. 16. The legislative zeal of the Saudi Government has not abated. One new law has imposed a tax of 50 piastres on each pilgrim who dies in the Hejaz, for burial expenses. 17. The local quarantine station remains the same. The quarantine doctor seemed to discriminate between various nationalities in his treatment of pilgrim ships. Launches of the Egyptian consul and his friends were allowed to go alongside Egyptian pilgrimage ships, but in the case of Indian pilgrim ships the doctor, at loggerheads with the Indian vice-consul, usually made difficulties. 18. King Ibn Saud was again very prudent in his political declarations Such propaganda as was made was directed towards attracting as many pilgrims as possible. A good many newspaper editors and other notables of neighbouring Arab countries were the recipients of presents; but the attitude of the King in the Palestine troubles was friendly and helpful to the forces of order and reason. The visit of the Grand Mufti on pilgrimage was a success for the King and perhaps a blow for the Amir Abdullah, but the King's influence with the Mufti was on the side of moderation. The Grand Mufti's idea of a pan-Arab congress at Mecca for ventilating his views on Palestine made no progress. The ' Young Men of Saudi Arabia ' again convened a large conference at Muna during the pilgrimage, attended by many nationalities, including Indians. But no discussion on Palestine was allowed. On the other hand, one speaker accused the Saudi Government of exploiting the Hejaz. 19. The rules preventing new converts to Islam from performing the pilgrimage seem to have been tightened up again this year. At least one such person was kept at Jedda and prevented from visiting Mecca. 20. Accommodation arrangements this year were rather'better than those of last year. The Government hotels were fully booked. The Government hotel at Medina was well patronised. The Hejaz motor service imported eighty new vehicles which were styled ' Mumtaz ' (superior). Passengers by these more glorious cars were charged 25 per cent, extra. Nevertheless, the shareholders were chagrined to receive only the same dividend, 10 per cent., as they had received last year. A commission of enquiry is said to have discovered some points for criticism but the directors were not changed. Mecca enjoyed a motor-bus service tor the first time in history; these buses were used during the rush period for the transport of pilgrims to Arafat, and, after the pilgrimage, to Medina. ndian pilgrims complained bitterly that Egyptian pilgrims were given preference to them in returning to Jedda. 0 1 21. The overland route between Najaf and Medina, referred to later in the report, functioned as before, but was used by a smaller number of pilgrims, i ndian pilgn mswho used this route complained of slowness of travel (ten days to Medina sometimes) and lack of consideration The direct motor route from Uqair via Riyadh is said to be one of the King's pet schemes still though nothing much seems to have been done yet. A caravan of ten buses is reported to have travelled from Basra direct to Mecca via Koweit and Riyadh. 22. The orphanage at Medina, mentioned in paragraph 25 of last year's report, continued to function and did good work for the destitute and very poor pilgrims. The founder of the orphanage visited Hyderabad (DeccaS and endeavoured to arrange that his orphanage should be amalgamated with the Hyderabad Industrial Institution at Medina. Finally a new oommittpp wae formed at Hyderabad under the presidency of Nawab Ahsan Yar Jung Bahadur chief engineer of the Nizam's Government. The new committee sent a representative to Medina to run the orphanage on more satisfactorv Hn^ with the support of the notables forming the committee in Hyderabad. Mor^r the Poor House mentioned in the last report, extended its scope, as it opined an orphanage and received contributions from various sources, including a more orless forced levy on pilgrims. Destitute pilgrims were accommodated in this orphanage instead of in prison. 23. A certain number of Indian pilgrims again performed the pilgrimage without sufficient funds. They had secured return tickets, but could not pay the mutawwifs' dues in advance—a sum of about 59 rupees this year. In cases of this sort the mutawwifs, or their wakils, usually imprisoned the pilgrims in the mutawwifs' houses till they could find the money somehow. Finally they usually managed to get off to Mecca at the last moment. Then on return a few of them were usually kept back, until in the end representations from the Legation to the Saudi authorities resulted in the mutawwifs' letting them go without payment in full. Such unfortunates should not, of course, undertake the pilgrimage at all. But as long as such indigent people persist in doing the pilgrimage, and as long as the Saudi rule that no pilgrim is allowed to proceed to Mecca unless he pays his mutawwif's dues at Jedda in advance exists, this problem will have to be faced. Anything which increases the power of the mutawwifs is of course to be deprecated; the Indian vice-consul draws a lurid picture of the abuses and oppression which used to go on in Turkish days when the mutawwifs were very powerful. 24. There is little new to report concerning pilgrimage shipping. A Spanish steamer arrived at Jedda bringing a few hundred Moroccan pilgrims. No Turkish steamer came from Istanbul this year. But a band of some 120 pilgrims from Chinese Turkestan, who travelled by overland routes via Russia and Turkey, missed the pilgrimage as they arrived at Jedda a few days late. 25. The rate of exchange against gold pounds showed no change. Prices of food-stuffs were, however, somewhat higher. Security was again maintained. Some petty pilfering was reported at Mecca, Arafat and Muzdalifa. 26. Instead of holding a general pilgrimage dinner, attended by pilgrims of all nationalities, the King held four separate banquets, as follows :— {a) On the 17th February, Indians were invited to a lunch. (5) On the same evening, Egyptians were invited to a dinner. {c) On the 18th February pilgrims of other nationalities were invited to a lunch. {d) On the same evening pilgrims of Arab nationalities were invited to a dinner. 27. The Indian vice-consul was not invited to any of these functions. Hardly any Javanese or Malayan pilgrims were present, but an individual called the &lt;c Amir of China ' was invited to the lunch on the 18th February. The King presided at each banquet, and delivered his usual discourse, stressing the unity of Islam, and his services to that cause. He finished by saying that he was a member of the Hanbali sect of Sunnis, and not a Wahhabi. Ismail Ghuznavi interpreted, translating the speech into Urdu for the benefit of Indians. 28. The scheme suggested by Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah whereby a Director of Pilgrimage should be appointed instead of the three Sheikhs-ul-Mutawwifin (see paragraph 31 of the last report) did not bear fruit. Vested interests were too great. The only result was the intensification of the general campaign against the Khan Bahadur whereby his prodigious efforts on behalf of the Indian pilgrims were blocked and he himself was subjected to a personal boycott. 29. Fewer notables than usual performed the pilgrimage this year. The following personages may be noted :►— Their Highnesses the Khan and Begum of Kalat; Sirdar Bahadur Nawab Sa'dullah Khan of Baluchistan; Mullah Tahir Saifuddin, Chief Priest of the Bohra community; the Pir of Pagora (Sind); and other Indians. Among non-Indians there were Muhammad Basyuni Bey, president of the Egyptian Senate; Talaat Pasha Harb from Egypt; His Highness the Amir of Kano from West Africa; Seyyid Amin-el-Husseini, the Grand Mufti from Palestine; three princes from Yemen, sons of the Imam, named Hussein, Qasim and Abdullah; Amir Nuri Shaalan, Kamil Qassab, and Riyad Bey Es Sulah from Syria; and finally the Chinese Amir mentioned above. A deputation of four or five Arabs from Tripoli is also reported. The Italian propaganda caravan of about 2,000 pilgrims from Eritrea, Italian Somalilandu\ 6 and Abyssinia has already been mentioned; it was led by Hassan Bey Muhammad Selim Ba Tooq of Massawah. Each pilgrim received a substantial sum, in return for which he was to sing the praises of Mussolini. The other caravan of propaganda, sent by General Franco from Spanish Morocco, was led by Qadhi Seyyid-el-Rahoona, an ex-Minister of Justice; and by Seyyid Abdullah-bin-Omar. Hasrrat Mohani (paragraph 34 of the last report) did not come this year. 30. Arrangements for the return of pilgrims worked as usual, but a good number of pilgrims were left behind on the sailings of the three ships for India during the period the 22nd March to the 16th April, 1937. 31. H.M.S. Londonderry, Captain H. B. Jacomb, R.N., visited Jedda for the Haj week. The ships' officers arranged the usual regatta; and thirteen moslem ratings performed the pilgrimage. 32. No forged rupee notes came to hand this plgrimage. 33. No further progress was made with the proposal for the delimitation ' of Arafat and Muna. 34. As mentioned below, the Afghan Minister did not bother himself very much about the pilgrimage; he evidently preferred Cairo or Alexandria to Jedda, and only came to Jedda for a few days at pilgrimage time. The Indian doctor deputed to look after Afghanis went sick himself and spent most of his time in hospital. 35. No further trouble about the ownership of landed property was reported this year in connexion with pilgrims. There were, however, the usual difficulties about the Government road tax or £C koshan,' which was imposed in such a way that foreign subjects had to pay more than Saudi nationals. 36. The ' Kiswa ' or woven cover for the Ka'aba was sent this year with the mahmal from Egypt, as in the old days. The e£ kiswa ' which had already been woven locally was placed in store. 37. No case of enslavement of pilgrims came to the notice of this Legation during the season. 38. Pilgrims returning to Karachi by steamship Alavi during June complained that the company insisted on landing them at Bombay instead of at Karachi, in spite of the fact that they had booked return tickets from Karachi. These pilgrims had stayed at Medina in order to take advantage of the lower 'koshan' (road tax) which applies after the pilgrim season is over. The shipping company, however, contended that their rules said that, if the number of pilgrims in any one ship did not reach 100, the ship could not be sent to Karachi, but was obliged to land all passengers at Bombay. (2) Statistics. 39. The following tables, compiled from information furnished by the quarantine authorities, give the usual statistical information. They differ to some extent from figures compiled from other sources. They give the total number of pilgrims landed at Jedda, Yanbu, Lith and Gunfida during the period the 3rd October, 1936, and the 17th February, 1937. A large increase will be noted in almost all nationalities, the chief exceptions being apparent rather than real; e.g., the Iraqi and Palestinian figures are less, but this may be counter balanced by the fact that some pilgrims of those nationalities came by overland routes. The well-known reluctance of the Iranian Government to see good Iranian money spent outside Iran has had its effect this year, no Iranians being shown as making the pilgrimage, though a few are included under '' Persian Gulf,' and some came overland. The total number of pilgrims increased from 34,252 in 1936 to 51,142 in 1937; these figures include 1,829 overland pilgrims in 1936 and 1,185 in 1937. The most remarkable increase in the national categories is the Egyptian, the number rising to nearly double that of last year (10,226 against 5,724); this was due no doubt to the Egyptian Government's sending the mahmal this year, for the first time for many years.Table (B).

(3) Quarantine. 40. The overland pilgrim route from Najaf in Iraq to Medina was again supervised medically. The Iraq Government maintained a quarantine station at Rahbah, a place in Iraq about 50 kilom. from Najaf, and took precautions that no cars containing pilgrims, either outwards or inwards, should escapeexamination at that post. A second quarantine camp was also established at Najaf adjacent to the Najaf hospital. 41. Arrangements on the Saudi side were not so satisfactory. A Turkish doctor, Adil Bay, was stationed at Hail in order to inspect pilgrims going and returning, and an Indian doctor named Hamid Hassan was stationed for three months a few miles from Medina with similar duties. 42. The usual quarantine measures were again established at Kamaran, Tor and Suakin. Kamaran. 43. The pilgrimage season opened with the arrival of steamship Teucer from the Straits Settlements on the 17th October, 1936, and closed with the departure of the steamship Akhar on the 14th February, 1937. During the season 24,002 pilgrims were dealt with, making an increase of 50 per cent, in comparison with the previous year. The most remarkable increase took place in the pilgrims from i^den, Jibuti and Mukalla; an Italian ship from Mogadiscio (Italian East Africa) brought 473 pilgrims from that port, this being the first occasion in recent years that pilgrims have been landed from this port Pilgrims from the Straits Settlements were more than twice as numerous as last- year; those from British India and the Netherlands East Indies also showed a substantial increase. The health of the pilgrims was very good, and last year's record was equalled in that no pilgrim had to be landed for disinfection purposes. The lady doctor reported that satisfactory arrangements were in force for women on pilgrim ships; she notes that educated women are increasing in numbers and on one ship formed a feminine bridge-club for the voyage. The women on the whole enjoyed the thrill of being on board ship. Inoculation and vaccination had to be carried out on one ship, from Aden. 44. The number of indigents of various nationalities arriving at Kamaran appears to be on the increase. They arrived by dhow or coastal steamer, and were all given prophylactic treatment before departure. 45. The Saudi medical authorities again pronounced the pilgrimage clean; His Majesty's Minister was therefore able, after the usual confirmatory steps, to dispense returning ships from calling at Kamaran. The cases of chicken-pox and two of smallpox were, however, diagnosed on returning steamers, and twenty-three deaths took place, mostly from dysentery, pneumonia and old age. Tor. 46. This station functioned as usual, pilgrims for Suez having to land. No traces of cholera being found, the pilgrimage was declared clean by the Alexandria Quarantine Board on the 6th March, 1937. All passengers and pilgrims for Suez had to produce certificates of vaccination and inoculation. Suakin. 47. This station functioned as usual. Certain cases of. chicken-pox were rejected by the Khedivial mail steamers, but there was no case of smallpox. It was noticed that the vaccine used on certain Sudanese was so potent that they developed large ulcers on their arms. Jedda. 48. The port doctors continued as last year. The Alexandria Quarantine Board was represented by Dr. Abdul Hamid Qasim. Dr. Mahmud Hamoodi, the director-general of the Mecca hospital, showed his keenness by going on board one of the Indian steamers in order to ' see whether the pilgrims had actually been vaccinated and inoculated, or whether they had only false certificates.' He also asked why Indian pilgrims were not inoculated against typhoid. (4) Health. General. 49. Pilgrims' health this year is reported to have been much more satis factory than in previous years. In Jedda, however, many deaths took place [15823] c10 between June and September 1936 from mumps and from a disease at one time thought to be cholera, but finally diagnosed as a form of malaria. Saudi Medical Service. 50. The Saudi medical service during the year ending the 31st May, 1937, was roughly as follows :— Mecca. —Mahmud Hamoodi was director-general; Adib Habal his assistant; and there were also one dentist, one analyst, one eye specialist, a physician for tropical and women's diseases, and another for abdominal and children's diseases, and a midwife; a new surgeon, named Rashid Firaun, was appointed for the pilgrimage. All these, with the exception of the Egyptian midwife, were Syrians. Jedda. —Three Syrian doctors and the Egyptian midwife remained, but the fourth doctor, a Turkish bacteriologist, named Salah-ud-Din, resigned. Medina. —A Turkish doctor, named Adil Bay, who was previously at Hail, was appointed to succeed Saeed Mustafa, who resigned. Taif. —One doctor. Yarihu. —No doctor. Bahra. —A dispensary as in past years, no doctor. Hail. —Adil Bay, now at Medina, was at Hail as quarantine officer during the pilgrimage. Riyadh. —A Syrian doctor, named Yasin, and a Hejazi X-ray specialist were reported at Riyadh, together with a midwife. Dr. Midhat, the Royal physician,, a Syrian, went to Europe with the Crown Prince. Ahha. —No doctor. Gunfida. —A Hejazi doctor named Mahmud-as-Sugari. Jizan. —A Hejazi doctor. Military Service. —One Turkish doctor named Ramzi Bay. Trans-Desert Quarantine, near Medina.—One doctor, an Indian named Hamid Hassan, employed on quarantine work during the pilgrimage to examine pilgrims from Iraq before their arrival at Mecca. Local Government Hospitals. 51. Jedda. —The Jedda hospital continued to function, though local inhabitants make little use of it. In-patients are confined to persons of the poorer classes. The secret of its failure is lack of money. Rumours of the proposed foundation of an elaborate Government pharmacy costing £2,000 with pharmacists, assistants, refrigerators, &amp;c., are offset by the sad fact that the one municipal pharmacy has been closed. Mecca. —The repairs to the central hospital are not yet finished, though the X-ray plant is working. The four students of X-rays, mentioned in the last report, are still studying abroad, and no X-ray expert has arrived yet. On the other hand the bacteriological department is reported to be functioning well. The operating theatre is satisfactory, but lacks electric current. A donation of £1,000 to the hospital by Taher Saif-ud-Din eased the financial situation. The National Humane First Aid Society, mentioned in paragraph 60 of the 1936 report, began to function fairly well and helped in the task of transporting diseased pilgrims; the society was supported by voluntary contributions; its headquarters were at Mecca, with a branch at Medina. Medina. —Apart from the branch just mentioned, there is nothing to report; nor has there been any progress at Taif. Work at Medina goes on in the old hospital; and the Taif hospital is still unfinished. 52. The Director-General of Health issued regulations during the year concerning questions related to health and the import of drugs; letters posted in Saudi Arabia had to bear a special ' Relief ' stamp, the proceeds of which were to be devoted to the First Aid Society's funds; importers of drugs have to obtain the director-general's prior permission; imported medicines were made liable to customs duties which might, in certain cases, be waived; foreign dispensaries must submit an annual return of cases treated.it 6? 11 53. The Indian Medical Officer's return of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals during the year ending the 31st May, 1937, is as follows : it is compiled from the weekly reports of the local health authorities :— Disease. Dysentery ... Consumption Puerperal fever Typhoid Mumps Chicken-pox Dengue Influenza Diphtheria ... Leprosy Smallpox Cases. Deaths. 900 7 345 81 42 41 11 7 11 10 6 3 5 2 3 3 1 1 54. It will be observed that syphilis, which accounted for nearly half the total cases treated last year, has been omitted altogether this year. It would also appear that, whereas last year about 4,000 cases (apart from syphilis) were treated, this year the number was less than 1,400. The percentage of deaths to cases treated, however, was slightly higher this year, being 10 -6 against 9-1. In view of the much smaller number of cases treated it appears useless to endeavour to draw any conclusions as to the prevalence of various diseases as compared with last year. Diseases during the Pilgrimage Season. 55. The health of the pilgrims was exceptionally good this year. No cases of cholera, plague, typhoid, or paratyphoid were reported; diarrhoea and dysentery were negligible, and the only case of enteric fever recovered. Influenzal catarrh was common amongst pilgrims, all of whom were obliged to swallow vast quantities of dust; and malaria was as prevalent as usual. A European distinguished himself by falling ill with a disease diagnosed as blackwater fever; the first case recorded from Jedda. Mortality. 56. Mortality among pilgrims resembled that of last year; at Arafat there were two deaths; in Muna twenty-four deaths during the three days' stay. General Sanitary Conditions. 57. Conditions in Jedda are much better than they used to be. Meat and vegetables are well protected in the newly built market. Dustbins have been provided by the municipality. Sweepers remove rubbish and see that no pools of stagnant water form. At Mecca things are much the same; the Egyptians are endeavouring to make some sanitary improvements; a slaughter-house has now been built outside the city and meat is transported in closed lorries to the city. At Arafat the banian trees are growing and will eventually give protection from the sun. At Muna (as well as at Mecca) the roads were sprinkled with phenyl for three days, though latrines and slaughter-house arrangements showed no improvement. The water supply remained the same. Government of India Dispensaries. 58. The Jedda dispensary worked as usual, and the annual supply of medicines and stores was eventually cleared through the Customs free of duty. 59. The Mecca dispensary was open from the 1st January, 1937, to the 9th April, 1937, and was served by Sub-Assistant Surgeon Ghulam Hussein and Dispenser Taj Muhammad, both paid by the Government of India. Dr. Abdul Hamid went to Mecca with the rest of his staff for the rush period. At Muna a house was hired by Dr. Abdul Hamid, and at Arafat tents were set up. The Government of India have sanctioned a rent allowance for a house at Muna, beginning in 1938. [15823] c 212 Cases Treated in the Indian Dispensaries. 60. The total number of cases treated in the Jedda dispensary in the year ending the 31st May, 1937, was 54,021, as compared with 41,886 last year. Of these, 8,540 were Indian pilgrims, as compared to 6,380 last year. At Mecca 13,500 cases were treated, as compared with 18,331 last year. No charges for medicines were made. Three hundred and seventy-four cases were seen at Muna and nine at Arafat. In-patients numbered sixteen this year; only one bed is kept, for special cases needing a few days' treatment. Three hundred and twenty-eight major and 3,461 minor operations were carried out. 61. The following table shows the percentage of the various diseases treated during the year in the Indian dispensaries :— Malaria and its complications 26 -50 Other fevers 0-60 Digestive troubles ... 9 10 Urinary diseases ... ... ... ... ... 7-08 Nervous diseases ... ... ... ... ... 7-27 Diseases of the locomotory system 0 -90 Respiratory diseases ... ... ... ... ... 4-40 Children's diseases 0-26 Women's diseases ... ... ... ... ... 1-60 Diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat 6 -30 Deficiency diseases ... ... ... ... ... 0-80 Circulatory diseases 0-30 Skin diseases ... ... ... ... ... ... 4-40 Wounds, ulcers and sinuses 30-20 Cystitis and stone 0-12 Hernia and hydrocele 0 -17 100-00 About thirty visits were made to patients in their houses, without charge. Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 62. The Egyptian Legation continued to maintain one doctor, without any dispensary. At Mecca the Egyptians keep two doctors permanently; and during the pilgrimage season the Egyptian Government sent a medical mission, consisting of four doctors and two assistant dispensers, to work at Mecca and Medina. 63. The Dutch keep a doctor at Mecca, but made no special arrangements for the pilgrim season. 64. A new Russian doctor arrived about April 1937 and opened a dispensary. 65. An Afghan medical mission, directed by an Indian doctor named Abdul Ghani, maintained a dispensary at Mecca for one month. 66. After being closed since June 1936 the Italian dispensary reopened in May 1937, with a new doctor and an old stock of medicines. Sanction for the new hospital, with fifteen beds, was not granted till June 1937. 67. Two Algerian doctors obtained permits to accompany the Moroccan and Algerian pilgrims to Mecca; they treated their own compatriots only. Legation Medical Staff. 68. Dr. Abdul Hamid and his staff worked with their usual diligence and skill, assisted this year by a new Government sub-assistant surgeon, Ghulam Hussein, and a new dispenser, Taj Muhammad. (5) Internal Transport. 69. For the first time in history aeroplanes were employed for the transport of pilgrims this year. A small number of pilgrims travelled by air from Egypt to Jedda; and an air service between Jedda and Medina was allowed after the pilgrimage day. The fare for the flight from Jedda to Medina and return was £18 gold, one-half of which represented cc koshan ' or road tax. The air service was organised by the Banque Misr.13 70. The Hejaz motor transport corporation, referred to in paragraph 79 of the 1936 report, worked fairly satisfactorily during the 1937 pilgrimage. There were, of course, a good many breakdowns, mostly in the inferior type of vehicle charging 25 per cent, less than the standard rate of hire; the superior class, called ' Mumtaz,' gave better service. This year it was noticed that a smaller number of Indian pilgrims travelled to Arafat by motor transport, and a larger number by camel, than last year. The Indian vice-consul thinks that this was arranged by the mutawwifs who get more chance of fleecing pilgrims travelling by camel, owing to the longer time taken. 71. The motor corporation survived the investigations of the Royal Com mission, and the same managing body was re-elected for another year. It purchased a fleet of eighty new motor vehicles, and was able to show a profit of 41^ per cent.; a dividend of 10 per cent, only was paid to shareholders, the rest being placed in reserve or charity funds. The number of pilgrims transported was more than double that of last year, as will be seen from the following figures; it is presumed that half a pilgrim means a child :— From Mecca to Medina and back From Jedda to Medina and back From Mecca to Jedda (single) From Jedda to Mecca (single) From Yenbu to Medina (single) From Yenbu to Medina and then to Mecca . From Medina to Mecca (single) ( 5 )From Medina to Mecca and back to Medina From Mecca to Arafat and back to Mecca From Mecca to Taif and back to Mecca 14,790 3,80U 6,817 25,197^ 46 380 170 774 6,191i 58,1711 72. The shareholders of the new corporation complained bitterly that the market price of their £10 shares had depreciated to £6. No figures are available of the income of section (b) (Government vehicles) (see paragraph 79 of the last report), but from the following statement of the total income of section (a) (surrendered vehicles) it appears that the total receipts were about four times as much as they were last year :— Piastres Saudi. Paragraphs. Balance of fares due during year 1354... Claim for repairs during year 1354 Fares due from Government for the year 1355 Piastres Saudi. Paragraphs. Fares received from pilgrims- Fares 23,107,309 30 In respect of stay at Medina... 230,826 Fares for Arafat and Medina... 2,242,423 30 Fares for Joorana, Umrah 233,083 15 Fares received from natives— Fares to Mecca 1,049,587 15 Other districts ... 91,709 35 Miscellaneous revenue— Interior roads ... 174,657 30 Price of materials 22,600 20 Cost of repairs ... 6,347 Price of cases, tins and tyres... 18,429 25 Radiators 22,824 30 Exchange of coins 206,960 20 392,578 305,690 1,743,737 35,813,642 1,141,297 15 35 10 451,820 Total 39,848,765 30 73. It is true that the last items grouped under the heading '' Miscellaneous revenue '' appear to be more like expenditure than revenue; but even allowing for possible mistake, the total is not seriously affected. In spite of large profit and huge increase in revenue, it does not appear that any improve ment was shown in the three points mentioned in paragraph 81 of the last report. ( a ) The number of overlanders by the Najaf-Medina route.u'A 14 74. The usual wrangling took place concerning precedence in returning to Jedda after the pilgrimage was over. Theoretically, those pilgrims who had done their pilgrimage and were not going to Medina were allowed to leave first, those who were bound for Medina remaining behind. But of those who had to return to Jedda, the Indians were subjected to some discrimination; Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Minister of Finance, appears to have been the real source of the trouble, as he was able to see that Moroccans and Egyptians were allotted places first. 75. The proportion of poorer pilgrims appears to have been less this year, for no less than 25,197 pilgrims travelled from Jedda to Mecca by motor vehicles. This is a little more than 50 per cent, of the total number of pilgrims, as compared with 33 per cent, last year. The proportion of Indian pilgrims who visited Medina this year seems to have been about the same as last year&gt; i.e., 60 per cent. 76. In view of the fact that pilgrims generally preferred to travel to Arafat by camel, there was less difficulty this year than last for well-to-do pilgrims in securing motor transport to Arafat; the charges were £1^ gold by bus and £3 gold by car. Overland Routes. 77. No motor transport appears to have come direct from India to the Hejaz this year. About 100 Indians came via Najaf, being transported by an Iraqi motor company. They complained, however, of many privations and some returned by sea, forfeiting their return fare to Najaf. The number of pilgrims who came overland this year is given as 1,185, about two-thirds of the number who came last year. Rates of transport are reported to have been cheaper. 78. A few vehicles are reported to have come from Basra via Koweit, but none from Syria. 79. As for the King's projects for a motor service from Uqair via Riyadh to Mecca, nothing definite seems to have been done yet, though rumour says that the King has paid £5,000 gold to Toweel Bey, Director of Customs in the Sheriffian regime, with instructions to purchase forty-two cars and organise an operating company with local shareholders. Camels. 80. It was a good pilgrimage for camelmen. Camel-hire remained the same, though an additional sum was imposed as ' road tax '; but this year, in contrast to last, the pilgrimage to Arafat was done usually on camel-back, not in motors. Cabs. 81. The practice this year at Mecca was the same as previously. But in Jedda the ingenious wakils conceived another plan for turning a dishonest penny. They persuaded the Government to prohibit motor vehicles in the town of Jedda during the rush period, so as to force pilgrims to take cabs to the houses of the wakils, who live, for the most part, very close to the quarantine office. Dhows. 82. The Government of India again renewed the arrangement with Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. whereby a pilgrim is charged in Bombay a sum which represents the cost of transporting his baggage from the ship to the shore and vice versa. Nevertheless, complaints were received from several pilgrims that they had to pay extra fees to the dhowmen who took their luggage between the ship and the shore. Representations were made to the Saudi Government, but it is doubtful if it is advisable in future to make a similar arrangement with Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co., for it has proved impossible to control the dhowmen, and it seems better that the pilgrims should be robbed by the dhowmen once than that they should pay in Bombay and still be robbed by the dhowmen at Jedda. General. 83. No interference was reported this year with pilgrims travelling on foot between Mecca and Jedda. As for the Medina road, those who paid the15 :r~ ^ Were not interfered with and were permitted to visit Medina (6) Customs. aDDe^ed S Q hH 1 ^Lf Ild Vena l , Iit y' the concomitants of bad administration, appeared to be much the same this season. . .Jf. Near tf : e beginning of the season the Customs instituted a system of detainer] effeCtS ^ each P 1 '® 1 '™; some Javanese pilgrims were detained three days in this way. But a simplified procedure was brought into effect before the arrival of the first pilgrims from India. g im0 o change in the customs schedules has been announced this season.

Even the women of the Bohra community, who were treated as guests of the Government were not allowed to visit the Jannat-ul-Baqieh cemetery at J ^rvW to T m prleSt named Mulla Tahir Saif-ud-Din was allowed to hold a service for his own congregation in a Medina mosque after the night prayer- though this privilege was not extended to other religious leaders. ' 90. Many complaints were received concerning the attitude of the Saudi Government to poor Indian pilgrims who could not afford to pay their mutawwif's dues in advance on landing at Jedda. These poor people were detained in the houses of the wakils until they produced the money. The Indian vice-consul reports that he was besieged by numbers of India/ moslems, including Sa lawyers, graduates, &amp;c who took the view that Ibn Saud had no right to fS a Pilgrim to complete the pilgrimage once he had got as far as Jedda. 91. Ihe attitude of the Saudi authorities towards new converts to Islam has been dealt with m paragraph 19 above. (8) Mutawwifs. ^ con duct of mutawwifs has been just as unsatisfactory as in past years. In tact, owing to various intrigues, they succeeded in consolidating their position and m frustrating most of the efforts which the Indian vice-consul made 0f pl fe rims V 1 Tlle two agitators from India, Ismail Ghuznavi and Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan, made common cause with the more venial of the mutawwifs and succeeded in practically isolating the Indian vice-consul Wakils who were friendly with him were threatened with dismissal- the Sheikh- ul-Mutawwifin, who looks after Indian pilgrims, gave orders that mutawwifs and wakils must keep away. The Khan Bahadur's control over those responsible for malpractices therefore became very weak and all kinds of trickery were attempted Certain mutawwifs neglected to perform the function from which they are named •' the duty of guiding their pilgrims in their circumambulation of the Ka'aba' Charges for rent of the land on which tents were pitched, excessive charges forluggage, failure to return money advanced in India, &amp;c., were the subjects of frequent complaints. 93. After the Haj things became even worse. The rate of exchange for conversion of pilgrims' dues was fixed at an anna or two more than the Indian vice-consul thought it should have been. Rent for the sojourn at Jedda pending the arrival of the returning ships was collected in advance, and only refunded with difficulty. Excessive charges for luggage were sometimes made. 94. The attitude of the Saudi Arabian Government in respect of the points mentioned in paragraph 103 of the last report has not yet crystallised into definite shape. Registration of pilgrims was still carried out; the rotation system by which the Legation controls the return passages of Indian pilgrims also functioned; the black list was still maintained, though the number of mutawwifs thereon was cut down as much as possible; and pilgrims still vented their complaints to this Legation. Nevertheless, whenever the Legation endeavoured to obtain redress in cases which 'prima facie seemed worthy of every consideration the stock reply from the Saudi Arabian Government was that the aggrieved person ought really to bring his grievance to the notice of the local Haj Committee. And the obstructive attitude of the mutawwifs and wakils, mentioned above, made it much more difficult to maintain the excellent 'registration' and 'rotation' systems. The Legation hears that Ismail Ghuznavi will not rest till he has short- circuited this Legation completely from its interest in the pilgrims; in other words, till Indian pilgrims are deprived of all right of recourse to this Legation while on Saudi soil. 95. The suggestion of the Indian vice-consul that a central pilgrimage office should be established to take the place of the three Sheikh-ul-Mutawwifin was not proceeded with. Vested interests were too great. 96. Mutawwifs in India are still unlicensed and the Indian vice-consul reported many abuses committed by them while on Indian soil. The practice of purchasing pilgrims continued; loans and advances were collected against false receipts; undue space was sometimes reserved on ships taking pilgrims at Indian ports; and certain mutawwifs were even suspected of trying to evade the regula tion as to vaccination and inoculation. The Saudi Arabian Government do not, of course, take any interest in the matter, as long as the pilgrims come. 97. As mentioned above, many complaints were received from indigent pilgrims, who found themselves unable to pay the whole of the mutawwifs' fees in advance. Such persons were searched and more or less kept prisoner in Jedda till a few days before the actual pilgrimage. After the Haj they were detained till the 30th April or later, the last four of them being allowed to embark in the beginning of July. 98. Efforts are being made to revive the 'taqrir' system for the whole of India. This really amounts to a kind of farming out of various areas to various mutawwifs. Certain vested interests, however, such as mutawwifs who have connexions in India and who always look forward to roping in more and more pilgrims each year, are opposed to such a scheme; and on general grounds it seems more desirable to have the present scheme of free choice for pilgrims, in spite of its present abuses. Under a 'taqrir' system, all pilgrims from one area would be absolutely in the hands of one mutawwif. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 99. The 25 per cent, reduction referred to in the previous report was theoretically maintained. The consolidated fee of £2-69^ gold was, however, increased this year to £2 * 81} gold; an increase of 12^ piastres. This increase was explained by the Saudi authorities as being on account of house rent at Jedda on the arrival and departure of pilgrims. Nevertheless, when the pilgrims arrived it was discovered that the charge only included one night at Jedda, and that additional nights would be charged at the rate of 1| piastres Saudi per night. 100. The 25 per cent, reduction was counterbalanced by the following innovations:— {a) New motor vehicles were purchased by the transport company, and all who could afford to do so were encouraged to travel by them. The fare was 25 per cent, higher than that for the old cars.17 (b) Certain transport charges were increased, as follows : t — T Pts. G. (i) Journey by car or bus either from Jedda to Medina and back or Mecca to Medina and back, per pilgrim ... 44 (li) Journey by car or bus from Jedda to Mecca, or vice versa, or from Medina to Mecca, or vice versa, single .... journey 11 (m) By camel from Mecca or Jedda to Medina and back, per pilgrim 22 (iv) By camel to Mecca from Jedda or from Jedda to Mecca, single journey 5^ pts., double journey 11 101. A small reduction was, however, made in the motor hire from Yanbu to Medina and thence to Mecca; the amount of the reduction being 27J piastres gold by bus and 12 piastres gold by car. This reduction would benefit almost exclusively the Egyptian pilgrims, who are no doubt popular with the local Government now that the mahmal has returned. 102. In paragraph 118 of the last report it was mentioned that pilgrims who wished to travel from Jedda to Medina found that they had to pay more than if they had travelled from Mecca to Medina (though the motor road from Mecca to Medina goes through Jedda); the theory being that the Saudi Government thereby lost what they ought to have received and would otherwise have received in the way of road-tax from Mecca to Jedda, amounting to £f gold. A similar anomaly is to be recorded this year, in the following shape; the bus hire from Medina to Mecca and back was shown in the tariff as £8 • 27^ gold, though the hire from Mecca (or Jedda) to Medina and back to Mecca was only £7 55 gold, i.e., 82J piastres gold less. The theory in this case seems to have been that pilgrims who arrive in Mecca by an overland route and return to their country by the same route cause the Government to lose the sum payable by an overseas pilgrim on his arrival at Jedda in respect of motor hire between Jedda and Mecca. It must also be recorded that pilgrims who arrived at Medina by the overland route found it very difficult to purchase single tickets to Mecca; and many who finally purchased return tickets and then changed their minds and decided to go home by sea were unable to obtain a refund; not only so, but they found they had to pay £2-63 gold consolidated charges, though this sum included services such as boat hire, porter age charges/rent at Jedda, &amp;c., which apply only to pilgrims landing by sea. 103. The Saudi Pilgrim Guide this year contained one useful item; it was the rate of motor hire for the journey to Arafat and back, the amount being £1-| gold by bus and £3 gold by car. 104. Small increases were announced in this year's tariff in the rate of camel hire from Medina to Mecca, and from Mecca to Arafat. The shuqduf (camel- litter) hire from Mecca to Medina, which was not fixed last year, was fixed at 61-35 piastres miri gold; and shuqduf hire from Mecca to Arafat and back was fixed at 8| piastres instead of 5\ piastres in 1936. A new road tax of £2 gold was imposed on cars entering the country. The Legation again prepared a statement of the approximate cost of the pilgrimage for various classes of pilgrims; for pilgrims travelling on deck and by bus the estimate came to 829 rupees; the estimate of the propagandist Ismail Ghuznavi came to about 440 rupees, but he seems to have omitted a good many items which could not well be avoided. 105. The following charges were reported by returning pilgrims to have been more or less compulsorily levied during the 1937 pilgrimage :— {a) A new tax of 3 rupees per head on all pilgrims who entered the special inner room of the Ka'aba. (6) Rupees 1/4/- were collected by the mutawwifs for the construction of an aerodrome at Jedda. {c) A tax of rupees 6/12/- for the construction of roads. (10) Indian Pilgrimage. 106. The Indian pilgrimage began this year with the arrival of the steam ship A lavi on the 30th October, 1936, and arrivals ended with the steamship A kbar on the 16th February, 1937.18 107. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India, from Burma, and from Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation British Subjects. Province. Total Number of Pilgrims in 1936. In 1937. Bombay. Karachi. Calcutta. Total.

The discrepancy between the foregoing total and that given in the chapter on '' Statistics '' above is due to the fact that the figures in that chapter chapter include Indian pilgrims from embarkation ports other than those in India. The present statement has been compiled from the lists of pilgrims sent to this post by the various Port Haj Committees in India, whereas those in chapter 2 have been compiled from information supplied by the quarantine authorities at Jedda. This table puts the total number of pilgrims from British India, the Native States, Burma, Ceylon and other foreign possessions in India at 10,041, as compared with 8,514 of last year. In order to facilitate comparison between the number of pilgrims this year and last, the figures for 1936 have also been shown in the above table. The number of pilgrims from Bengal, Bombay, Madras and Central Provinces and Burma, showed an appreciable increase in the year under review, while the other provinces showed little change. 109. The following list shows the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports :— Chinese (Turkestan) Chinese Afghans South Africans Nepalese Russians Persians Hejaz-Nejd subjects Far East Arabs from Persian Gulf Arabs from Hadhramaut Tibetans Miscellaneous 1936. 509 33 1,107 16 2 2 171 3 106 ''7 14 1,970 Bombay. 21 44 4 12 9 139 9 13 4 18 273 1937.

Any difficulty in reconciling the foregoing figures with those in chapter 2 above is due to causes similar to those indicated in paragraph 108 above. In order to facilitate comparison between the number of pilgrims this year and last, the figures for 1936 have also been added. There is a slight increase in the number of pilgrims from Chinese Turkestan and Afghanistan, while there was a remarkable difference in the number of Russian pilgrims this year, as compared with that of last year, there being eighty-eight against two of 1936. The number of Hejazi-Nejd nationals increased from 171 last year to 247 this year. This gives an idea of the growing army of propagandists despatched to India from Jedda. 111. As for the number of Indians who arrived for the pilgrimage by routes other than the ordinary ones, no statistics could be obtained for this pilgrimage. It has been mentioned elsewhere that about 100 Indians are said to have come from Najaf overland. 112. The Mogul Line of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co. was again the only line engaged in the pilgrimage traffic from India this year. 113. The following table shows the movement of return traffic, with details of the number of ships available on given dates for repatriation of pilgrims, the number of pilgrims awaiting repatriation and the number actually repatriated : Dates. Number of ships in port. Pilgrims awaiting embarkation. Pilgrims despatched. Pilgrims remaining. Remarks. 1937— March 1 4 4,914 1,650 3,264 Rahmani.

It will be observed that the steamship Alam sailed on the 22nd March leaving behind 303 pilgrims, who had to wait till the 27th March before obtaining a passage; again, on the 27th March, 571 pilgrims had to remain behind, and did not get a ship till eight days later. Similarly, 329 pilgrims were left behind by the steamship Jehangir on the 16th April; some of them had been waiting for eight days by that date. When, therefore, they finally sailed on the 30th April, they had been waiting about twenty-two days. These pilgrims, were not however, entitled to compensation for delay, as they arrived in Jedda after the expiry of six weeks from the date of the Haj. 115. The following table gives the number of ships run, voyages effected, and pilgrims carried by the Mogul Line :— Outward from India. Homeward to India. Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of ships. voyages. pilgrims. ships. voyages. pilgrims. 6 13 12,833 ( 6 ) 6 9 12,560 ( 7 ) ( 6 ) The discrepancy between this figure and that given in Table (B) is due to the fact that the figures in the table include infants, while the shipping company's figures, given above, only include those for whom quarantine dues were payable. ( 7 ) This figure includes 242 destitutes, who came overland, &amp;c., but returned by steamer at the expense of the Government of India. Some pilgrims also came from India, not during the pilgrimage season, and returned after the Haj : 659 return tickets remained in deposit with this Legation. [15823] d 220 116. The following table shows the ports of embarkation and destination of the Indian pilgrims mentioned above :— Pilgrims Pilgrims Port. embarked. returning.

It will be seen that the only deposits were made at Karachi, the figure being forty-one instead of ninety-two. Return of Pilgrims to India: General. 119. Mention has already been made of the number of pilgrims who were left behind on the 22nd and 27th March, and on the 16th April. The usual attempts were madfe by the richer pilgrims to circumvent the ''first come, first served '' rule by purchasing tickets from poorer pilgrims; the Indian vice-consul, however, took steps to ensure as far as possible that tickets were not transferred; and he suggests that it would help in checking the pilgrims' pass with his ticket if the former bore a photograph of the pilgrim. The local agents of the shipping company exposed themselves to strong criticism by sending steamship Alavi on the 16th March with pilgrims to Hodeida, in view of the fact that the number of Indians was not, by that date, sufficient to make up a full complement. The aggrieved Indians who had the mortifying experience of seeing steamship Alavi go off to Hodeida without them were persuaded by the Indian nationalist Ismail Ghuznavi to air their grievances by a telegram to King Ibn Saud; the royal answer, however, arrived too late to interrupt arrangements. 120. Many pilgrims expressed the natural desire to know the exact dates of sailing of Haj ships for India in advance. This question has been dbalt with separately ; practical difficulties seem insuperable. Food, Accommodation, &amp;c. 121. Complaints were again received this year of the quality of the food on board the pilgrim ships. Reports rendered by the medical officer of steamship Jehangir were brought to the notice of the Bombay Port Haj Committee. It seems that certain problems connected with the storage of heavy luggage have still to be solved. 122. Suitable persons were again appointed as ' Amir-al-Haj ' by the Port Haj Committees and by the Legation, on the outward and the return journeys respectively, on the same lines as last year. Their reports, rendered at the end of the voyage, contained useful matter for consideration.21 Pilgrim Passes. 123. It is understood that the Government of India is considering a proposal, made by this Legation some time ago, that each pilgrim pass should bear a photograph of the pilgrim. If this proposal is adopted, it will be much more difficult for impostors to travel on passes to which they are not entitled. The Indian Section of the Legation issued 65 duplicate passes to pilgrims who had lost their original documents, and a further 217 emergency passes to pilgrims who had travelled overland on foot and, having remained in the Hejaz for a long period, had lost their original passes. Refunds on Deposit-Paid Passes and Return Tickets. 124. The system mentioned in the last report was continued and functioned satisfactorily. Nothing further was heard of the Saudi Government's views as to refunds on the return tickets of non-British subjects. Registration. 125. The usual arrangements for registration of pilgrims worked satis factorily this year, in spite of the increased friction with the local authorities. Of the 10,588 Indian pilgrims shown as arriving by sea 9,816 registered at this Legation. 126. Fifty-five unclaimed or unused return tickets or deposit-paid! passes dated 1936 were left in the hands of this Legation, and will be forwarded as usual to the Bombay Port Haj Committee after eighteen months. 127. Suitable arrangements were made as usual to obtain passes for the five Indians who had not deposited their return tickets at this Legation, and for the fifteen foreign pilgrims who reported the loss of their return tickets. Local Haj Committee. 128. The local Haj Committee, moribund in 1936, expired finally this year. The representative of the shipping company, a Saudi subject, was forbidden to attend. The result was that pilgrims had to attend themselves at the Legation pilgrimage office instead of leaving everything to their wakils. The ' Rotation System,' whereby chits bearing serial numbers in accordance with the order of reporting at the pilgrimage office are issued, worked rather more smoothly as pilgrims by attending personally got to know by direct enquiry in what ship they would sail. On the other hand, more work was cast on the Indian pilgrimage office; and the previous system had the advantage that wakils, who are all local residents, could be made responsible for safe custody of passes, tickets, &amp;c., more readily than the individual pilgrim, often a feckless and irresponsible person. On the whole the Indian vice-consul considered that the elimination of the wakil was a good thing. Hyderabad State Caravan. 129. The Director-General of the Ecclesiastical Department of the Nizam's Government again made excellent arrangements for the State caravan of pilgrims. They were transported in a special train from Hyderabad to Bombay. The same leader of the pilgrimage or Kafila Salar,' Moulana Abdul Qader Mohi-ud- Din was again appointed and made elaborate and efficient arrangements for the welfare and orderly conduct of the pilgrims under his charge. Friction with the mutawwifs, however, made the task of the ' Kafila Salar ' more difficult than it should have been. The Indian vice-consul proffered a suggestion that a certain mutawwif named Muhammad Eafi, resident in Hyderabad, for some time and in receipt of a salary from that Government, might be appointed mutawwif for the whole Hyderabad State pilgrimage. He would have to engage a reasonable number of ' sabees ' for the season; perhaps one sabee for twenty pilgrims. This suggestion is being brought to the notice of the Government of the Nizam.130. Destitutes this year were much fewer than last year. Of 242 (against 662 last year) all but ten came overland.

A quotation of 40 rupees per head having been obtained, as last year, for repatriation of destitutes, they were sent home at the cost of the Government of India. Rupees 411/4/- were collected from those able to contribute. The net cost to the Government of India was rupees 11,357/12/-. Full lists were forwarded, and the usual undertaking to repay was obtained from each person. Lists this year were made out for each province separately. 132. It is satisfactory to note that the number of destitutes this year was so much less. Some destitute persons, however, still seem to travel to Arabia in dhows from Bombay or Karachi, and then walk from whatever place they find themselves in. The Saudi authorities seem to realise that destitute pilgrims are to be discouraged. Publicity. 133. The Bombay Port Haj Committee again published a Manual of Instructions for Pilgrims. The Saudi Arabian Government were as usual some what late in publishing their approved schedule of charges; as a consequence supplementary sheets, showing the alterations, had to be hurriedly attached to the old list; an arrangement which did not make for clearness. An attempt is being made in the summer of 1937 to secure the new schedule at an earlier date.23 Banking Facilities. that thp am ^ntr^ arks ! n last JT' 8 re P 0 , r ! ; a PP 1 y equally well to this year, except to 900 rupees only sur P s cas ^ 1 deposited by pilgrims at this Legation amounted Indian Staff. ^r.i 135 ^ Tw .?

The number of Afghan pilgrims this year showed a moderate increase as compared with the previous year; the figures being 1,756 compared with 1,498 seventeen of the Afghan pilgrims travelled by sea. Hardly of them appear_to have been destitute; for only two or three tried to pass themselves off as Indian destitutes; these two or three were repatriated by local C ari i oo Tif Afghan Legation took little interest in its destitute pilgrims. i Afgh'Y 1 Minister resided during the year in Egypt.

(12) Malay Pilgrimage. 1^1: pilgrimage season under review started with two ships, the steamship Teucer and the steamship Neleus of the Blue Funnel Line, despatched from Singapore m quick succession, the first on the 1st October and the second on the 3rd October 1936, carrying 445 and 1,340 pilgrims respectively, the latter including those from Penang. Five other ships followed, all of the same line bringing m all a total of 4,970 pilgrims. 142. Of this number, 2,524 were British Malayan pilgrims according to the renter, the rest being Dutch (Javanese), Siamese, Chinese, American (Philippmo) and persons of other nationalities. The Malayan total was made up as lollows it—• ^ Straits Settlements—&gt; Singapore Penang and Province Wellesley Malacca Labuan Federated Malay States^— Perak Selangor Pahang Negri Sembilan Unfederated Malay States—■!

It will be observed that the number this year was not far from three times that of last year (906)24 Pilgrim Passes. 144. {a) The fee for a pilgrim pass was raised this season from 1 to 2 dollars each in every Colony and State with the exception of Penang, Province Wellesley, Kedah, Kelantan and Trengganu. (&amp;) In spite of repeated reminders in the past, two or more pilgrims continued to be entered on one pass in the districts of Krian, Teluk Anson, Sitiawan, Ula Selangor, Sabak Bernam and Batu Pahat. One pilgrim put down in his pass as under 12 years of age was found by the shipping agents at Penang to be 15. Jedda Customs. 145. As a result of representations early in the season the Saudi Arab Government issued revised Customs Regulations whereby certain quantities of pilgrims' clothing, food-stuffs, &amp;c., were allowed free through the Customs at Jedda, much to the satisfaction of all concerned. One or two cases of pilferage, however, occurred during the Customs examination of the pilgrims' luggage. Conditions on Board Pilgrim Ships. 146. Some dissatisfaction was expressed by Malay pilgrims about the food, or rather about the way the food was prepared on board the pilgrim ships, but there was no official complaint. At the same time it was gathered that some Dutch (Javanese) pilgrims travelling in these same ships addressed complaints to the shipping agents in Singapore on this matter. The Cost of the Pilgrimage. 147. {a) Haji Abdul Majid estimates the total cost of the pilgrimage this year to have been approximately as follows ; figures are taken from the Saudi Arab Government's tariff : they do not include fares from Malaya or return :— (I) the whole pilgrimage including the visit to Medina :— {a) (b) (o) (d) (e) By camel .., By bus (old) By bus (new) By car (old) By car (new) £G. 14 18 22 23 27 G.P.

Favouritism and intrigue interfered this year with the rotation system to a noticeable degree : Haji Abdul Majid and his staff had a good deal of difficulty in ensuring that pilgrims who arrived first should return first. Notables—Malay Pilgrims. 150. The season under review was remarkable for the number of Malay notables who came on pilgrimage. They included :— From— (1) Singapore— {a) Tunku Mansur. (6) Tunku Abdul Kadir. (2) Penang— A. K. Muhammad Ibrahim, I.S.M. (3) Perak— {a) Raja Kechil Sulong and (6) His wife, Raja Metra. {c) Seyyid Nurdin, M.C.S. (4) Negri Sembilan— (a) Inche Abdul Aziz, M.A.S. \h) Raja Tachik. (5) Pahang— {a) Inche Som, mother of H.H. Sultan of Pahang. {h) Inche Fatmah, widow of a former Sultan of Pahang. (6) Kedah— {a) Tunku Dakiah. (&amp;) Tunku Kalsom. Both daughters of H.H. Sultan of Kedah. (7) Trengganu— {a) Tunku Khadijah bint, late Sultan Ahmed. (8) Johore— {a) Dato Abdullah-bin-Abdul Rahman, D.P.M.J., P.I.S. \h) Inche Nasir, J.C.S. Assistance to Pilgrims. 151. No financial assistance for repatriation was applied for during this season, although forty-six emergency certificates were issued, which meant that there were forty-six pilgrims who had disposed of their tickets in one way or another, and were therefore without tickets to return home with. 152. The luggage left behind by seven pilgrims travelling in steamship Mentor was forwarded by the next pilgrim ship, steamship Perseus, to Penang. 153. As a result of notices distributed among pilgrims regarding the Saudi Arabian Wakf Law, some enquiries were received and attended to; a few persons were thus deterred from entering into negotiations to purchase houses for purposes of 4 c wakf '' by the old and dangerous method of registering them in the names of the sheikhs. Deceased Pilgrims. 154.—(1) The total number of deaths among the pilgrims this season, as reported to the Malay pilgrimage officer, up to the 30th March, 1937, was 118 (?), seven of which occurred before their arrival at Jedda. This represented a percentage of about 4^ per cent, of the total number of arrivals, which was higher than the 3 per cent, of last year. Enquiries elicited the fact that most of these deaths occurred during the pilgrims' visit to Medina during a very cold spell. [15823] e26 (2) The effects of deceased pilgrims unaccompanied by relatives collected by the Saudi Treasury during last season were collected by the Malay pilgrimage officer this season for distribution to the respective next-of-kin. Suggestions. 155.—{a) The suggestion, made in 1930, that second-class accommodation on board pilgrim ships might be provided for better-class pilgrims was revived this season, and the local agents of the shipping company concerned promised to take the matter in hand. (&amp;) An interesting suggestion was made by a few pilgrims, namely, that bicycles might be used as a means of transport during the pilgrimage. (c) The Saudara of Penang in several editorial leaders suggested that arrangements might be devised whereby pilgrims might be saved the trouble of spending lengthy periods in ports of embarkation waiting for pilgrim ships; and though enquiry elicited that the victims of such long waits were mostly Patani (Siamese) pilgrims, this suggestion might be well worth looking into. Staff. 156. Haji Abdul Majid, the Malay pilgrimage officer, arrived at Jedda on the 22nd October, 1936, and left on the 12th April, 1937. Haji Muhammad Jamil, temporary clerk, employed now for the eighth season, assisted him from the 19th October, 1936, until the 6th April, 1937. (13) West African Pilgrimage. 157. According to Saudi quarantine returns 4,586 West Africans came on pilgrimage this year via Suakin and Jedda, an increase of 2,036 over last year s figure. In addition, 201 West Africans are shown as having disembarked from dhows at the port of Gunfida. Most of them were in possession of return tickets to Massawah. A number of pilgrims who satisfactorily proved the loss of their travel documents were issued with emergency certificates and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. were good enough to provide them with free passages to the Sudan. 158. The comparatively small number of 79 travelled under the auspices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme this year; all of them arrived in the country in time to perform the pilgrimage. At the time of writing this report, sixty-five of these pilgrims have collected this return tickets and the balance of their deposits. The scheme did not work smoothly this year owing to the late receipt of the nominal lists from both Nigeria and the Sudan. The lists, together with duplicate passes and return tickets in respect of seventy-five pilgrims were eventually received from the Sudan on the 15th March, twenty-three days after the pilgrimage. Further delay and considerable confusion was caused through the misnumbering of passes and tickets by the authorities at Suakin. By a very slow and tedious process of elimination sixty-five pilgrims were eventually disposed of by the 20th March and sailed for the Sudan the same day. 159. The dhow traffic from Massawa is believed to have continued in 1937, but no precise information is available. 160. The Amir of Kano, accompanied by thirty-five followers, arrived in Jedda en route for Mecca and Medina on the 5th February. Whilst in Mecca he ran short of funds and was advanced the sum of £125. 161. No West African applied for repatriation this year. (14) Somali Pilgrimage. 162. Saudi official quarantine returns show that 1,214 Somalis of all nationalities disembarked at Jedda on pilgrimage this year, as compared with 403 last year. The increase is largely in respect of pilgrims from Italian Somaliland. 163. Thirteen Somali ratings of H.M.S. Londonderry, on a visit to Jedda during Haj week, performed the pilgrimage to Mecca. 164. During the return season twenty-five pilgrims were advanced the total sum of £91 17s. 6^. 165. No application for repatriation was received this year.27 L (15) Sudanese Pilgrimage. 166. According to Saudi quarantine returns 1,658 Sudanese pilgrims disembarked at Jedda this year, as compared with 1,195 last year. No fewer than forty-two emergency certificates were issued to Sudanese pilgrims who claimed to have lost their Suakin pilgrim passes, together with their steamer tickets during the pilgrimage. As in previous years, Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) Limited very generously provided most of them with free passages to the Sudan. 167. The reduced scale of mutawwifs' dues, standardised last year, remained unaltered; and no differentiation was made between townsfolk and countryfolk (see paragraph 194 of last year's report). All Sudanese pilgrims who arrived at Jedda direct from Suakin were required to pay only half dues, which were again fixed for collection purposes at £E. 2 150 mm. ^Despite this concession, made by the Government only under pressure from the mutawwifs, on the grounds that it was almost impossible to collect the full dues of £2 • 63 gold piastres from indigent pilgrims, the mutawwifs experienced the greatest difficulty in collecting their dues. In many cases they had to be content with the standard advance of £E. 1 500 mms. which the pilgrims collected from the Legation after the pilgrimage. (See paragraph 195 of the 1936 report.) 168. Applications for advances were more numerous this year. During the return season 161 pilgrims were each advanced the sum of £E. 1 500 mms. In almost every case the entire sum was handed over to the pilgrim's mutawwif in settlement of dues. It became evident this year that the loan is regarded as a right by the large majority of pilgrims, and that an increasingly large number of Sudanese firmly believe that they can perform the pilgrimage equipped with a return steamer ticket and a few piastres to cover subsistence, fully assured that any additional monetary requirements will be duly attended to by the Legation at Jedda (see paragraph 207 of the report for 1935). 169. Complaints regarding the inadequacy of shipping facilities during the return season were, as usual, numerous. This is a recurring problem which could be partly solved by the enlargement of the quarantine accommodation at Suakin, which would then permit of Khedivial steamers making immediate return trips and consequently help to relieve the heavy pressure which occurs during the first fortnight after the pilgrimage. Again this year a large number of pilgrims had to wait fourteen days for a homeward-bound ship. The first ship to depart after the pilgrimage was over-booked, consequently many pilgrims who had returned to Jedda on the 28th February had to wait for the next ship, which left on the Mth March. 170. Prominent among Sudanese pilgrims who performed the pilgrimage this year were Sultan Muhammad Bahr-el-Din, Sultan of Dar Masalit, Darfur Province, and Sheikh Barakat Ghuwainin, Nazir of Eashyda, Kassala Province. 171. Twelve pilgrims are reported to have died oii pilgrimage; eight at Jedda and four at Mecca. 172.

According to Saudi quarantine returns 100 Zanzibari and East African pilgrims arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year, an increase of 75 on last year's figure of 25. 174. No Zanzibari or East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (17) South African Pilgrimage. 175. Saudi quarantine returns show that 105 South African pilgrims entered the country this year through the port of Jedda, an increase of sixty-three on last year's total of 42. They were mostly of Indian extraction, and people of means who required no assistance other than the necessary passport endorsement. 176. No South African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. [15823] f28 (18) Palestinian and Trans]ordanian Pilgrimage. 177. Official returns published by the Saudi quarantine authorities show that 428 Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims entered the country this year through the ports of Yanbu and Jedda : 116 via Yanbu and 312 via Jedda. This figure falls short of the total of 447 given by the Palestinian Government as having registered with the Palestine Health Department as intended pilgrims, and shows a decrease of 342 on last year's total of 770. 178. No figures are available regarding pilgrims who came overland, but their numbers would appear to be slightly on the increase. Thirty-nine pilgrims in this category came to the notice of the Legation this year, five of whom were natives of Transiordan. Twenty-eight of the Palestinian contingent travelled via Amman and Tebuk, and six via Garayat-el-Malh. The five Transjordamans travelled via the Ma'an-Tebuk route. According to the pilgrims' statements, the Saudi authorities at both Garayat-el-Malh and Tebuk collected dues equivalent to £5 gold from each person. Thirty-three of these pilgrims were in possession of regular passports, and returned home by sea via Egypt; two of them were repatriated at the expense of the Government of Palestine. Of the remaining four persons, none of whom were in possession of any form of identity papers, three have since been repatriated. 179 As the number of registered pilgrims was not expected to exceed &amp;UU (see paragraph 207 of last year's report) it was not considered necessary to apply for the services of a clerk from Palestine. The Palestinian Government were, however, good enough to accede to the suggestion that a clerk should be engaged locally for service over a period of six weeks. Hassan Effendi Kamel, a budam, was employed in this capacity and proved to be of great assistance to the omcer under whom he worked. . 180. Applications for refunds of deposits were more numerous this year; probably as a result of the increased cost of living during the pilgrimage Ninety pilgrims were each advanced the sum of £4, one Transjordanian £4 lO 5 -? an d two pilgrims from Hebron district were advanced the full amount of £5, to enable them to settle debts contracted locally. 181. During the return season numerous complaints were received from Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims who held return tickets on Misr Line steamers. The first two Misr steamers to return after the Haj were filled with Egyptian nationals, to the complete exclusion of non-Egyptians. And in many instances accommodation was allotted to Egyptians who had travelled from Suez in Khedivial Mail Line steamers. This form of discrimination naturally gave rise to an acute feeling of dissension in a large party of Palestinian and Transjordan pilgrims who, anxious to return home as soon as possible, were amongst the first to arrive in Jedda after the Haj. For two days they packed the courtyard of the Egyptian consulate, loudly protesting against such untoward treatment. However, representation made by the Legation to the local Egyptian authorities achieved the desired result, and the entire party left a few days later. 182. A notable who performed the pilgrimage this year was Seyyid Amin-el- Hussaini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. 183. Repatriation of Palestinian and Transjordanians (а) Applications deserving of consideration 6 (б) Applicants repatriated 5 (c) Applications still under reference 1 (19) Pilgrimages of Adenese and Natives of the Aden Protectorate. 184. Saudi official quarantine returns show that 573 Hadhramis and natives of the Aden Protectorate disembarked at Jedda this year on pilgrimage, and eighty-eight Hadhramis are shown as having landed at the port of Lith, an increase of 169 and 40 respectively on last year's figures. As usual, no figures are available regarding those who came overland. 185. There was a slight decrease in the number of emergency travel documents issued during the return season to Hadhramis of the semi-settled class. Only 140 such documents have been issued as compared with 155 last year and 212 in 1935.29 186. Complaints were again received from a number of pilgrims who held return tickets on Besse Line steamers. In most cases the local agents made refunds which enabled the pilgrims to return in steamers of the Turner, Morrison Line. 187.

According to Saudi quarantine returns forty-five Muscati pilgrims arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year. No figures are published regarding those who came overland. But the ' Koweit ' Intelligence Summary No. 1 of January 1937 shows that a caravan of some 400 pilgrims left Umm-al-Amara en route for Mecca on the 11th January. Other pilgrims left at a later date by car, but no figures are available regarding them. 189. No Muscati, Bahreini or Koweiti pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (21) Sarawak Pilgrimage. 190. During the 1937 pilgrim season thirty-eight Sarawak subjects visited Saudi Arabia to perform the Haj. All departed from this country in due course and their health was excellent. No outstanding Sarawak personality was among them. 191. It is interesting to record that this total of thirty-eight is the largest since 1927.Mr. Trott to Viscount Halifax.—(Received Auqust 29.) (No. 165.) 1 My Lord, Jedda, August 16. 1938. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith the annual report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz for 1938. 2. I was again unable to report from personal knowledge of the actual &gt; \ pilgrimage at Jedda, as I was on leave when most of the important events of the pilgrimage took place. I have therefore again had to rely largely on reports and records left by the departmental officers concerned. Mr. Lai Shah Bokhari, the new Indian vice-consul, Dr. Ghulam Rasul and Haji Abdul Majid have supplied full and carefully compiled materials for the Indian pilgrimage details, the medical remarks and the Malay pilgrimage details respectively. Mr. Ousman has dealt with most of the other nationalities who make the pilgrimage in some numbers. I have again adhered strictly to the general lines of the previous report. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to the same authorities as last year, viz., to the Government of India (External Affairs Department), to the Government of India (Department of Education, Health and Lands) and the Government of the Straits Settlements. I have, &amp;c. A. C. TROTT. Enclosure. Pilgrimage Report , 1938. (1) Introductory and General. THE Saudi Arabian Government have reason to be satisfied with the 1938 pilgrimage. Numbers were greater than last year; there were no disasters or epidemics; in fact, everything worked quite smoothly. The internal political situation during the year ending with the pilgrimage had been peaceful and satisfactory: King Abdul Aziz had consolidated his relations with his neighbours by means of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood with Iraq and the Yemen, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had visited Iraq and Syria, and the Iraqi Finance Minister came on pilgrimage. The Amir Saud visited Bahrein before the pilgrimage, and the Sheikh of Bahrein came on pilgrimage with his family. The stalemate which appears to exist with Koweit over the blockade did not prevent Koweitis from making the pilgrimage; in fact more than usual came this year. Rumours of troubles with Transjordan were denied by King Abdul Aziz, and a good many pilgrims came over the Transjordan frontier, including a number of I Syrians. 2. The Egyptian pilgrimage passed off well. Talaat Pasha Harb carried out extensive propaganda through the Banque Misr, and, in spite of a general election in Egypt, nearly 10,000 Egyptians made the pilgrimage. The mahmal came only as far as Suez; the kiswa, or sacred covering for the Kaaba, was sent on to Mecca, though the Saudis seem to have thought it was not as good as Ms was used to be in the good old days. At any rate, the Egyptians appear to have deferred to Saudi views about the mahmal. 3. The usual propaganda is Moslem foreign countries in favour of the pilgrimage went on, except in Turkey and Iran, both of which countries appear 10037 [17847] B2 as a rule to make it impossible for intending pilgrims to obtain foreign exchange for their journey. The vagaries of the Moslem calendar seem to make it impossible to forecast on what day of the week the Haj day will fall; full advantage was again taken of this convenient fact this year by the^ spread of statements that this year the pilgrimage would be a ' c Haj-i-Akbar ' with its tenfold blessing. In point of fact, however, Pilgrimage Day fell on a Wednesday and not on a Friday. Saudi propaganda was not confined to attracting pilgrims; when they arrived in the country they were again subjected to propaganda exalting the achievements of the present regime. Economic conditions in Java and Malaya appear to have been even better this year, and the number of pilgrims from those countries increased by about 50 per cent. A similar increase took place in pilgrims from India; this fact is probably due in large part to the intense rate war between the Mogul Line and their new rivals, the Scindia Navigation Company. The Italian ' Protector of Islam ' does not appear to have protected quite as passionately this year as last; however, it is reported that nearly 500 pilgrims came from Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland at Government expense. Eight hundred and fifty-nine pilgrims arrived from the Spanish Zone of Morocco in a vessel flying the Franco flag; 520 of them were said to be Riffians who had been subsidised to the extent of being allowed to purchase their exchange at a very cheap rate, and they arrived full of praise of the insurgent regime, with rumours that a consul-general was to be appointed; perhaps a rival '' protector is about to manifest himself. 4. Pilgrimage Day, which had been announced for Thursday, the 10th February, was finally, by an announcement made on the 7th February, fixed for Wednesday, the 9th of the month. The sudden change of date caused great discomfort and confusion in transport arrangements. There were some murmurings among the sufferers from this curious alteration of date; pilgrims were heard to remark that the date of the Haj was being fixed by Wahhabi mullas, not from the lunar calendar. But the pilgrims assembled at Arafat to the number of about 125,000. Precautions were taken to prevent attacks on the King, and a Bengali pilgrim who attempted to kiss the hands of the King in the mosque at Arafat was arrested on suspicion, but afterwards released. Climatic conditions were good, and the general health of the pilgrims at this favourable time of the year was excellent. 5. At the time of the visit of the Sheikh of Bahrein it was noticed that the same measures were taken in respect of the sheikh as had been taken to protect the King against attack : when the distinguished visitor made the circumambula- tion, the ordinary pilgrims were brushed aside and made to interrupt their devotions. This gave rise to some complaints from those who felt strongly about the Islamic conception of the equality of all believers before God. An Indian physician, named Hakim Seyyid Ahmed Sasawani, who had come on the pilgrimage bearing a special present of ingenious locks for the King, was arrested as the result of an anonymous letter declaring that he would attempt to murder the King; all was eventually explained and he was released and compensated. An equally respectable pilgrim from the Sudan was similarly arrested on suspicion that he was intending to murder the King with a dagger in the mosque. 6. No changes are to be recorded in the general economic condition of the country. The American Oil Company in Nejd and the Petroleum Development Company in the Hejaz employed some labour, and the former seem to have struck much more oil than they expected; the consequent royalties are beginning to be paid, and may, in the end, enable the Saudi authorities to reduce the present high rate of fees for pilgrims. Four Arab companies were operating in economic matters, according to the newspapers, but their precise functions were very obscure. The road project, from Jedda to Mecca and also from Jedda to Medina, was the subject of a good deal of talk, and is evidently to be financed partly out of the Egyptian waqf funds and partly by Saudi funds; but nothing has actually been done yet. 7. Sir Nizamat Jung visited the Hejaz again after an interval of two years, but does not seem to have arranged to his satisfaction details of his schemes for repairs and improvements. He put a sum of 12,000 rupees at the disposal of the Minister of Finance for the construction of a rest-house at Rabigh; whether such a building will be useful is doubtful, as the pilgrims seem to prefer to frequent wayside coffee-shops than rest-houses.3 8. No great fluctuations of currency were noticed. 9. The aviation fund is thought to possess vast funds, but it makes little use of them. The Italian air mission is still in Jedda and flights are made whenever there is petrol, which is not often. A flight to Yanbu was written up with much embellishment in the press, and if there had been enough fuel the intrepid flyers might have gone on the Wejh. A new French aeroplane, a Caudron-Renault, was brought by a French officer and is treated with great respect. 10. The Banque Misr again ran an air service for the pilgrimage, and among the first to fly were the Minister of Finance and the Kaimakam of Jedda. Just before the pilgrimage one of the two machines met with an accident near Medina. The other was chartered by Princess Khadija Abbas, who arrived from Egypt, a day before the Pilgrimage Day, left by car for Jedda immediately after the pilgrimage, then flew to Medina and Tor, and then on to Egypt after doing the three days' quarantine. An Indian contractor named Majid made some enquiries about the prospects of starting an aeroplane service from the Persian Gulf for Indian pilgrims, but he seems to have come to the sensible conclusion that the practical difficulties were too great to make it worth while. 11. Indian propagandists were again prominent; Ismail Ghaznavi, Mohammed Khan Ghazi Khan and Mohammed Amin were again among the pilgrims. It is pleasant to be able to record that they were not at all obstructive to the new Indian vice-consul; in fact, they were helpful to him whenever he invoked their aid. One of their principal activities was applauding the adminis tration of the local government. Ismail Ghaznavi, one of the promoters of the Scindia Line, devoted most of his energy to promoting that line and making difficulties for the rival Mogul Line. He left for India as soon as he had obtained a cheque for 10,000 rupees for himself and 2,000 rupees for his assistant, Abdul Aziz, editor of the newspaper Klnadim-i-Ka'ba. The Finance Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, did something for the Indian pilgrims after the Haj; the Indian vice-consul had brought to his notice the preferential treatment accorded to Egyptian pilgrims in the matter of transport last year; the Finance Minister promised not to repeat this discrimination this year, and was as good as his word. In fact, in some respects Indian pilgrims did better than others; owing to a shortage of transport, pilgrims were ordered to stay only three days in Medina instead of the usual eight; at the instance of the Indian vice-consul this rule was relaxed in favour of the Indian pilgrims. 12. The Banque Misr again made use of their barges in landing pilgrims. There is still no Banque Misr Hotel at Medina; the new hotel at Jedda (paragraph 15 of the 1937 report) was again used for pilgrims; and the Grand Hotel at Mecca was finished and opened for pilgrims' use ten days before the Haj and was very popular. The King is said to have been shown round it and to have been greatly interested, especially in the electric lift; brushing aside an objection by one of the Nejdi staff that it must be an invention of Satan, he expressed an intention of building a palace at Mecca with similar fittings. 13. Two new taxes have been imposed and have given rise to the complaints which were to be expected. One is the registration tax on foreigners of 10 riyals per head; after the observations of this Legation were received, certain modifi cations were introduced in the application of this nex tax. The other tax was one of a quarter riyal on each animal sacrificed at Muza. 14. No discrimination in the quarantine arrangements for pilgrims was noticed this year. Dr. Ibrahim Adham has been removed from the post of quarantine doctor, and his successor has kept things going smoothly. 15. The King has continued in his very correct attitude as regards Palestine; the pilgrimage has not been allowed to be used as propaganda against the British policy in Palestine. All that a group of pilgrims from Palestine were able to do was to distribute a certain amount of inflammatory literature amongst the pilgrims. False rumours of trouble at Aqaba alarmed those interested in the pilgrimage from that district, but they, were soon contradicted by the King. 16. Converts to Islam from other races are still the object of great suspicion. When Lady Abdul Qadir visited Jedda to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina out of the usual season, she brought with her an Englishwoman who had professed Islam for ten years. Nevertheless, this convert had to be examined again by the local Qazi, whose report had to be considered by the Qazi of Mecca, who had to consult the King, and so on; what finally happened was [17847] b 2•K ■ ' 1 that the lady waited in Jedda until Lady Abdul Qadir completed her pilgrimage in Mecca and Medina, and then went off to India with her. 17. Accommodation arrangements were similar to those of last year. The Hejaz Motor Service imported some thirty cars and 170 lorries, which were driven recklessly in all directions over the places where the roads ought to have been. More cars are constantly arriving, as the depreciation rate is enormous. 18. The overland route between Najaf and Medina functioned well this year. 19. Haji Abdul Ghani Dada, who founded the orphanage at Medina, has died, but his orphanage continues to do good work there. Sir Nizamat Jung's opinion was that it was time for the Saudis to take over its management. 20. The vexed but ever-present question of destitute and semi-destitute pilgrims is alluded to in detail below. Such persons are to be divided into two main categories : those who arrive here with their fares paid and with their return tickets, but without sufficient money to pay the local dues for mutawwifs, &amp;c. These persons are subjected to various indignities, though all of them seem to be released at the last moment from durance vile at Jedda as so to be just in time to do their pilgrimage. Finally, they either borrow the money for the fees, or get some kind person to pay for them, or are let off—though this is difficult, because the mutawwif or vakil has to pay two-thirds of the dues in cash to the Saudi Government when the pilgrims arrive. The second category consists of persons who manage to cross from Baluchistan to the Arabian coast in a dhow with neither papers nor money, and then beg their way to Mecca. The Saudi Arabian Government tries its best to keep such persons out of the Holy Land by a cordon of guards on the Yemen frontier, but some of them manage to get through. Some return in a similar way, while others make false declara tions to this Legation, saying that they have lost their passes, &amp;c., and are repatriated at the expense of the Government of India. The goodwill of the Minister of Finance, the Kaimakam of Jedda, and the Sheikh U1 Mutawwifin or head mutawwif, has to be invoked for these destitutes, and, although in the end they manage to do their pilgrimage, they cause endless trouble. 21. There was no Turkish steamer this year. The resurrection of the old shipping rivalry for Indian pilgrims had a great effect on fares; the El Medina and the Englestan, which formed the fleet of the Scindia Line, competed with the Turner Morrison boats of the Mogul Line, the result being a fierce rate war; some pilgrims were actually taken for the return journey to India at an inclusive charge of 25 rupees, very much less than the net cost to the carriers. 22. Security was good. The full severity of the barbarous penalty for stealing was said to have been applied to three Bedouin, and no others risked losing their hands. Pickpockets were at work in the haram, however Fewer complaints of lost baggage reached this Legation. rn , | 3 - The King held three banquets this year for distinguished pilgrims. Ihe nrst Wcis for Indians. Invitation cards in three separate colours distinguished the sheep from the goats; the most favoured ones sat at the King's table lesser lights at the Amir Saud s, and the least of all at the Amir Feisal's Ismail (jnaznavi was not invited, though he was in Jedda and could have attended; nor was the Naqib of the Indian wakils honoured with an invitation. The Indian vice-consul at this Legation was invited but could not attend. The second banquet was tor Javanese, and the third for pilgrims who spoke Arabic The King made a speech at each ceremony, the burden of his remarks being the same as last year-—«■«., that he was a Hanbali, and therefore as good as orthodox a Moslem as any adherent of the other three recognised sects. The speech at the first banquet was translated into Urdu by the chief representative from Hyderabad State, Seyid Qadir Muhiyuddm. J 24. A good many notables made the pilgrimage this year. Among the mast important were the following:— ^ &amp; k - i . ^^ykeikh of Bahrein and his family. Chaudhury Muhammad Ismail Khan, M.L.A Pir Seyyid Jamayat Ali Shah (Punjab), Nawabzadeh Mir Saeed Alam Khan of the Indian Political Service, Masud Ali Khan, M.LA. (Bengal), Nawab Sir Nizamat Jung Bahadur (Hyderabad). Princess Khadija Abbas came from Egypt; and Seyyid Idris-el-Idrisi from the Sudan. The Sultan of Tajura and Sheikh Omar-el-Azhari came from French Somaliland. Two pro-Franco propagandists, named Hainan Muhammad-ben-Amer, and Saiyid Ahmad-bin-Sadiq-al-Ghaman came, but did not stay long.Arrangements for the return of the Indian pilgrims worked much more smoothly this year than last. Within the first two weeks after the Haj nearly half of the Indian pilgrims were got away; and during this period, when so many complaints used to be heard in the past, no pilgrim had to wait more than a day or two in Jedda. 25. H.M.S. Londonderry (Captain W. K. D. Dowding, D.S.O.), visited Jedda for the Haj week. Arrangements were made for a regatta on Haj day on the same lines as last year. The French ship won most of the prizes. 26. The Afghan Minister paid a flying visit to Mecca and Medina, attended a few parties, and rushed back to Cairo at the earliest opportunity. An Indian doctor was sent to look after Afghan pilgrims; he did not stay long. 27. Foreigners again had to pay the road tax known as ' Koshan/' from which Saudi subjects are exempt. So what with koshan and the new registration tax foreigners felt oppressed, but these things made no difference to the pilgrimage numbers. 28. The proposal mentioned in paragraph 38 of last year's report, that ships transporting Indian pilgrims should land the Karachi pilgrims at that port instead of taking them to Bombay even if the number of Karachi pilgrims did not quite reach 100, was not agreed to. 29. A few refugees from Sinkiang came on pilgrimage this year. General Mahmud Si Jang (Shih-chang), alias Mohiti, travelled from Karachi with three companions witE Chinese passports, and left in April for Alexandria, with the intention of visiting Turkey and Syria. Twenty-five Tungen refugees from Sinkiang also visited Mecca and appeared to intend to settle down there. 30. The Iraqi Government reduced the amount of the deposit demanded for their pilgrims from 8 Iraqi dinars to 7 Iraqi dinars, and a similar reduction was authorised in the deposit extracted from Indian pilgrims from Iraq. 31. As a result of complaints from Palestinian pilgrims that they were made to give precedence to Egyptian pilgrims on Egyptian boats returning after the pilgrimage, it was ascertained from the Palestinian Government that Palestinian pilgrims are only permitted to travel on Egyptian pilgrimage ships as an act of grace, and that they have no claim to prior consideration over Egyptian pilgrims. 32. Three hundred and sixty Tunisians sailed from Tunis in January in a French ship with a representative of the Bey on board; they returned in March, all save one, who died at sea. 33. Seventeen Persians came on pilgrimage this year, having received special permission from the Shah, probably through the intercession of Hassan Esfandiary (Muhtashim-es-Saltaneh). A brother of Seyyid Zia-ud-Din (Prime Minister of Persia in 1920) also came via Palestine. 34. The Japanese Government, according to a published report dated the 30th January, 1938, are maintaining close contact with Japanese students of Islam. The motive for this interest was declared to be the hope that the geographical distribution of Mahometans would form a barrier against the spread of communism. Seven Japanese pilgrims were seen performing the pilgrimage this year. But the most important symptom of Japanese interest in the Islamic antidote is the opening of the new mosque in Tokyo. Invitations to the opening were sent to the Egyptian and the Yemen Governments, as well as to the Saudi Arabian Government, who sent Sheikh Hafez Wahba. 35. Eeports from Aden say that one Muhsin Tchapan Oglu, a Turk, resident in Japan, visited Sana at the end of March; he was the president of the ' Japanese Moslems Federation.' His interviews with all the leading personalities of the Yemen were not confined to invitations to the opening of the mosque; he tried to do some business connected with the sale of arms. 36. Chinese Moslems were even more to the fore; a &lt;c Chinese Moslem Near East Goodwill Mission, under one Captain Naji Djelaleddin Wanzinshan, visited Jedda early in March with the object of enlisting sympathy in Moslem countries for the sufferings of China at the hands of the Japanese. (2) Statistics. 37. The following tables, compiled from information obtained unofficially, give the usual statistical information. They differ to some extent from figures10 6 compiled from other sources. They give the total number of pilgrims landed at Jedda, Yanbu, Lith and Gunfida during the period the 14th September, 1937, and the 9th February, 1938. A large increase will be noted in the number of Indian and Javanese pilgrims. The total number of pilgrims increased from 51,142 in 1937 to 67,224 in 1938; these figures include 1,185 overland pilgrims in 1937 and 3,436 in 1938. The remarkable increase in the Indians can be attributed mainly to the keen competition between the two rival shipping companies, while that of the Javanese reflects the rise in the price of rubber. The increase in the number of Persian Gulf pilgrims was due no doubt to the arrival of his Highness the Sultan of Bahrein to perform the Haj this year. Table (A).

There was no report of any large number of pilgrims from Koweit ' ( 8 ) This year separate figures for Yanbu, Lith and Qunfida could not be obtained /dP a 7 Table (B).

The apparent decrease in the number of British voyages is explained by the fact that the Khedivial Mail (or rather the ' Pharaonic Mail ') boats were registered under the Egyptian flag this year for the first time. Consequently, the number of Egyptian voyages went up from eleven to forty-eight, and the number of pilgrims they brought went up to twice the previous figure. Nevertheless, the British boats must have been fuller, on an average, than last year, as the thirty-nine voyages brought more pilgrims than the eighty-two of 1937.8 (3) Quarantine. 39. Arrangements for the medical inspection of pilgrims from travelling by the desert route Najaf-Medina were similar to th o®® of j The Iraq Government maintained a quarantine post at Rahbah, where all outffoing and incoming pilgrims were examined. On the Saudi side . ^ Faraoun was in charge of the examination of these pilgrims ; he was assisted b&gt; an itinerating doctor and, on the whole, the arrangements they made worke satisfactorily. Kamaran. 40. As far as Kamaran was concerned, the pilgrimage season opened with the arrival of mail steamship Polyphemus from the Netherlands Indies on the 14th September, 1937—almost a month earlier than the previous year—and closed with the departure of the steamship Akhar on the 3rd February, -Uurmg that period 37,543 pilgrims were dealt with, again an increase ot 50 per cent, as compared with the previous year. Twenty steamers came from British India, 13 from the Netherlands Indies, 9 from the Straits Settlements and 4 from Arabia and Africa. Great increases were recorded in the number of pilgrims from the Netherlands Indies and from the Straits Settlements. The health of the pilgrims was very good. The following cases of infectious diseases were reported : one case of measles and one case of modified smallpox from the Straits Settlements, and one case of modified smallpox and two cases of chicken-pox from British India No ct infected ' or ' suspected ' steamers put in at Kamaran during the season- all steamers were therefore dealt with according to the measures prescribed for ' healthy ' ships in article 20 of the Anglo-Dutch Agreement of 1926. All the steamers calling at Kamaran were exempted from landing their pilgrims. The system of mustering pilgrims on deck for inspection proved easy and efficient. An Italian troopship named steamship Sannio brought 616 pilgrims from Mogadiscio. The hospital on this ship was very large and well equipped : shower baths and porcelain wash-basins were provided for the use of the pilgrims. 41. The Government of India have decided to reduce the quarantine fees in future from the present rate of 8 rupees per head to 3 rupees. They have approached the Netherlands East Indies Government with the suggestion that that Government should bear some of the resulting loss of revenue, but in the last resort they are prepared to bear it all themselves. 42. The Anglo-Italian Agreement of April 1938 agreed to the presence of an Italian doctor at Kamaran; he has not arrived there yet, and there is a difficulty about accommodation. 43. His Majesty's Minister was able to dispense returning ships from calling at Kamaran in the same way as was reported last year. Tor. 44. This station functioned in the same way as last year, except that for the first time returning pilgrims landed from aeroplanes and did their five days' under observation in the lazaret before being allowed to proceed to Egypt; that the Permanent Commission of the Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the return pilgrimage clean on the 24th February, 1938 : and that the health of the pilgrims this year was exceptionally good, there being no single case of infectious illness. The Tor station closed on the 30th March, and the Alexandria Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage closed on the 15th April, 1938. Suakin. 45. The Sudan Government maintained, and improved in various ways, their quarantine station at Suakin. All pilgrims coming from or through the Sudan were concentrated at Suakin where they were vaccinated against smallpox and inoculated against cholera. In addition, owing to the prevalence of relapsing fever amongst West Africans, delousing was carried out where necessary this year, in order to protect the Hejaz from infection with this disease. Certain modifications were also introduced in the arrangements for returning pilgrims; facilities were improved and certain unnecessary routine measures omitted. For instance, the preliminary medical inspection of pilgrims on board ship was discontinued, as there is a doctor on board ship. New sheds including a separate examination room for the women were built. Clean pilgrims were exempted from9 bathing and delousing. The quarantine period was reduced, first from five days to three days, and then to a little over twenty-four hours. The examination of pilgrims for bil-harzia was discontinued. And finally the quarantine dues were reduced from 500 to 300 milliemes. J edda. 46. At Jedda Dr. Ibrahim Adham-al-Jazaerli acted as quarantine medical officer and port health officer in the absence on sick leave of Dr. Yahya Nasri. But after the pilgrimage both Dr. Adham and his assistant were removed from their posts by command of the King : it is reported that this was in consequence of complaints made against them by Egyptian pilgrims. (4) Health. General. 47. The health of the pilgrims was very satisfactory. The diseases which were most prevalent were malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea : most of the deaths were due to these diseases, or to old age. Some of the Indian pilgrims had gangrenous ulcers 6n their arms arising from vaccination at Bombay. After the pilgrimage a great number of pilgrims were treated for influenzal catarrh, due to inhaling the dust of Muna and Muzdalifa. Saudi Medical Service. 48. Mecca. —The staff at Mecca resembled that mentioned in last year's report. There were two hospitals there, and the staff, all Syrians except the Egyptian midwife, included a surgeon, a specialist in abdominal diseases, midwifery and women's diseases, and a chemist and bacteriologist. A veterinary surgeon is to be engaged and attached to one of the Mecca hospitals next year. Jedda. —Dr. Akram Shooman was director and surgeon, assisted by Dr. Taufiq-al-Qiseibati as medical officer, a dispenser, and a midwife. The dismissal of the Acting Director of Quarantine has been mentioned above: he was succeeded by Dr. Adil Mahish from Medina. Medina. —Dr. Adil Mahish as director, who was later on transferred to Jedda, Dr. Euad-al-Mahroos as medical officer, Fauzi-al-Safaai as compounder and Mile. Nabeehah-al-Safadli as midwife. Taif. —One doctor. Yanbu. —One doctor, and one dispenser. Wejh. —One doctor and one assistant dispenser. Jauf. —The same establishment as Wejh. Hail. —One doctor. Riyadh. —Dr. Midhat is the private doctor to the King. Dr. Rashid is a surgeon and X-ray specialist, and Dr. Ahmed Yasin is a medical officer in the Riyadh hospital: and there is a midwife. There is also one itinerating doctor, who has visited Rabigh, Medina, Hail, Bureida, Aneiza and Shaqra. Local Government Hospitals. 49. J edda. —A few poor patients and soldiers and policemen visit the local Government hospital for treatment. But the foreign dispensaries are much more popular: these include the Indian dispensary maintained by the Government of India, the Italian and the Russian dispensaries. A Syrian specialist trained in France in surgery is reported to have returned to Jedda and to be prepared to perform operations : if so, he will be able to supply an urgent local need. Mecca. —Dr. Ghulam Rasul reports that the X-rays department of the main hospital is working well and is very popular. The Syrian doctor in charge appears to know what he is doing. The operating theatre is tidy, but the instruments are few, and operations rare. The hospital is equipped with a high pressure steam sterilizer. The outdoor dispensary was well attended. A disinfection plant exists and was working. The First Aid Society has done good work in rendering first aid to pilgrims who collapsed : their ambulance cars were prominent during the Haj. Medina and Taif. —There is nothing to add to last year's report except that the X-ray machine for Taif is to be installed soon. [17847] c10 50. The Director-General of Health issued instructions to the public regarding measures to be taken for the limitation of malaria. This step in the right direction was supported by regulations allowing the importation of quinine and other anti-malarial medicines duty free. 51. The Indian medical officer's return of cases treated and deaths in Government hospitals during the year ended the 31st March, 1938, compiled from the weekly reports of the local health authorities, is as follows :— Diseases. Dysentery Consumption Puerperal fever Typhoid ... Mumps Chicken-pox Dengue Influenza ... Diphtheria Leprosy Smallpox ... Measles Whooping cough Erysipelas... Tetanus Syphilis Total 1,519 139 Cases. Deaths. 1,166 47 78 26 60 40 39 8 30 2 24 10 3 1 4 1 1 • 79 14 17 1 4 1 1 1 52. It looks from these figures as if dysentery and puerperal fever had been more, and consumption less, prevalent than last year. But these figures really give no real indication of the prevalence of diseases in this country, as a very large number of local inhabitants prefer to trust themselves to one of the Legation dispensaries than to make use of a Government hospital. The percentage of deaths to cases treated is 9-15, as compared to 10-6 last year. The inaccuracy of the figures is reflected in the inclusion of only one case of syphilis. General Sanitary Conditions. 53. The Indian medical officer is more impressed with the defects than with the recent improvements in general sanitary conditions in this country. Little attempt is really made to cover vegetables and meat from flies, though the Director of Health seems to do his best to persuade shopkeepers to do so. Arrange ments for the slaughtering of animals at Muna show some improvement. But apart from the main streets, most of the town of Mecca is soiled with human excreta, and at Muzdalifa and Muna almost every inch of the ground becomes covered with human dejecta : in fact, no attempts seem to have been made to solve the difficult problem of latrine accommodation for pilgrims performing the observances prescribed by the prophet. Government of India Dispensaries. 54. The Jedda dispensary worked as usual, and the annual supply of drugs was cleared through the customs without payment of duty. 55. The Mecca dispensary remained open from the 19th December, 1937, to the 26th March, 1938, being directed by Dr. Ghulam Hussein and served by Dispenser Mohammad Ali. Dr. Mirza Ghulam Rasul went to Mecca with the rest of his staff for the rush period. At Muna the dispensary and the staff were accommodated in half of the house hired jointly with the Indian vice-consul, the rent being paid by the Government of India. Cases Treated in the Indian Dispensaries. 56. The total number of cases treated in the Jedda dispensary during the year ending the 31st May, 1938, was 44,573, as compared with 54,021 the previous year and 41,886 the year before last. Of these 8,763 were Indians, as compared with 8,540 last year. At Mecca 18,444 cases were treated, of which 4 590 were11 Indians. Three hundred and six cases were seen at Muna. In-patients numbered 14. Thirty-nine selected surgical operations were performed and 3,037 minor operations carried out. 57. The following table shows the percentage of various diseases treated during the year in the Indian dispensaries :— (1) Malaria and its complications ... ... ... 16 00 ^ (2) Diseases of digestive system ... ... ... 16-50 (3) Respiratory diseases ... ... ... ... 8-75 (4) Urinary diseases ... ... ... ... ... 1*75 (5) Circulatory diseases ... ... ... ... 1'75 (6) Nervous diseases 1'50 (7) Diseases of the locomotory system ... ... 1*50 (8) Diseases of the areolar tissue ... ... ... 5-00 (9) Skin diseases ... ... ... .•• ... 7-75 (10) Eye diseases ... ... ... ... ... ... 5-50 flit (11) Ear diseases 4-00 (12) Nose diseases ... ... ... ... ••. 0-60 (13) Disease of the lymphatic glands ... ... ... 0 03 (14) Diseases of the liver ... ... ... ... 0-25 (15) Injuries ... ... ... ••• ••• ••• 3-65 (16) New growth ... ... ... ... .•• ••• 0-25 (17) Eheumatism 6-25 (18) Ulcers 9-20 (19) Gonorrhoea ... ... ... ... ••• ••• 5-00 (20) Syphilis 0-85 (21) Infectious diseases 0*26 (22) Diseases of generative system 1 • 00 (23) Diseases of blood ... ... ... ... .•• 2-75 (24) Deficiency diseases ... ... ... ••• ... 0-01 Total 100 00 ^ About 110 visits were made to patients in their houses without charge. Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 58. The Egyptian Legation continued to maintain one doctor without a dispensary. At Mecca the Egyptians kept two doctors permanently; and during the pilgrimage season they sent a medical mission in the same way as last year. 59. The Dutch maintained one doctor at Mecca, with one dispenser. 60. The Soviet Legation kept one doctor at Jedda. 61. The Italian Legation kept one doctor. 62. The Afghan Government kept open a dispensary for one month at Mecca during the days of the pilgrimage; this was looked after last pilgrimage by Dr. Seyyid Rashiduddin, an Indian. Legation Medical Staff. |*4| 63. Dr. Mirza Ghulam Rasul, M.B., B.S., D.P.H., D.T.M. and H., of the Punjab Civil Medical Service, took over charge from Dr. Abdul Hamid on the 26th October, 1937. He was assisted by two new dispensers. Dr. Ghulam Hussein with a dispenser worked at Mecca. N (5) Internal Transport. 64. Air transport for pilgrims was not a great success this year. As has already been reported, one aeroplane was damaged before the pilgrimage and the only other one was engaged by Princess Khadija for her journey to Mecca and back; it then took spare parts to its damaged sister-plane, and that was the end of air transport for pilgrims this year. The high fare of £18 gold for the journey Jedda to Medina and return again applied. 65. The governmental monopoly of motor transport, which now has the name of ' The Arab Motor Company,' must have made huge profits from the pilgrimage. Transport arrangements were no worse than in previous years, though there were [17847] c 212 the usual breakdowns and complaints of being stranded. The number of pilgrims who travelled by car exceeded last year's figure by 10,818, but less pilgrims used cars for the journey from Mecca to Arafat; for such short journeys it was more popular to take a camel. The Government endeavours to discourage pilgrims from taking camels, in the hope of getting more revenue from road taxes; but a large number of the faithful, having tried cars already, preferred entrusting themselves to camelmen than to chauffeurs. 66. During the year the Government had bought about 100 new Ford cars, and had made over about 250 cars to the Arab Motor Company, at a valuation of £g.23,870. The Government received in payment 2,387 £10 shares in the company and thus became the biggest shareholders. The company are reported to have had 644 cars in running condition during the year, and to have sold back some to the Government. The tendency is for Government officials to run the company; the Finance Minister and his friends hold a number of shares, and ordinary share holders are being squeezed out by depressing the market price of shares to a good deal less than £10. 67. The following table showing the number of pilgrims who were conveyed by motor transport shows that the total number of pilgrims using this method of transport increased by more than 10,000, as compared with last year :— From Mecca to Medina and back From Jedda to Medina and back From Mecca to Jedda (single) From Jedda to Mecca (single) ... From Yanbu to Medina (single) From Yanbu to Medina and then back to Mecca From Medina to Mecca (single) From Medina to Mecca and back to Medina and from Medina to Mecca only ... 1,706 From Mecca to Arafat and back to Mecca 6,191 J 5,002 From Mecca to Taif and back to Mecca 4 From Medina to Mecca and back to Medina 774 In 1937.

The income of the company this year is given as 54,183,681 piastres miri, as compared with 39,848,765 last year. The bus service continued last year. The Saudi Government exempted all Saudi subjects from the payment of 'koshan' tax this year, a discrimination which caused a good deal of complaint from foreign pilgrims. But perhaps it was inevitable that the motor company should reduce their fares after the Haj was over. 69. A good deal of trouble arose over the shortage of local drivers. Hejazi chauffeurs resented the Government's action in importing 100 Sudanese drivers, and when the latter lost their way or broke down, as they frequently did, the Hejazis refused to go to their assistance. There were also frequent vague complaints of extortion on the part of the chauffeurs, who would slow down and stay a long time at villages on the way on purpose, till stimulated by an appro priate tip to get to Jedda in time to catch a ship. 70. A new transport company called the Nejd Company ' was formed this year, ostensibly for the transport of passengers from Nejd to the Heiaz with a capital of £15,000 gold, made up of 3,000 shares of £g.5 each However no shares were allotted to private hands: the Government took half and the Arab Car Company the other half; and its operations are shrouded in mystery 71. A large garage is under construction in Mecca, to be paid for out of the profits of the car company. Its cost is estimated to be £12,000 gold. 72. The Jedda-Mecca and Jedda-Medina roads remain in their pristine scate, and the car company's statement that repairs have been made is not confirmed by those who have tried to travel on them. Nothing has yet been done13 about the construction of proper tar-sprayed roads, though the Egyptian Govern ment is certainly in active negotiation with the Saudi Arabian Government on the subject. The waqf funds, together with the proceeds of the Saudi road tax, will provide the funds necessary to start. Overland Routes. 73. About ninety Indian pilgrims, mostly Shias, came on pilgrimage via Najaf. Adequate transport arrangements were made by the Iraq Motor Company, but the journey was long and tiring. The total number of pilgrims coming overland from Iraq was 1,898. No pilgrims came overland direct from India in a through car. A contractor named Majid, from Calcutta, visited the Hejaz with a view to arranging an air service for pilgrims from India. Camels and Cabs. 74. The same remarks as in last year's report apply. No cars were allowed inside Mecca during the pilgrimage this year, so the cab drivers of Mecca flourished as well as those of Jedda. Dhows. 75. As the result of representations from this Legation the Government of India discontinued this year the arrangement whereby boat-hire from the ship to the shore was payable in advance when the pilgrim bought his ticket at the Indian port. Collection had therefore to be arranged at Jedda. The sheikh of the dhowmen first endeavoured to collect the fares from the pilgrims at the quay; this proved difficult as pilgrims never had the proper change. Eventually, the Naqib of the wakils was ordered by the Government (which is interested in collecting the dues, as it claims a part of them) to arrange collection through the wakils, together with the mutawwifs' dues. This pleased nobody, as wakils were unable to collect dues from some indigent pilgrims, and neither the dhowmen nor the Government received their full payment. The local authorities then issued instructions to the local agents of Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Company to effect collection; but they replied that they had orders from their principals in Bombay not to do so. It is for the local authorities to think out some suitable scheme; the interest of the Government of India and of this Legation is confined to seeing that pilgrims are not overcharged, or charged twice, as they sometimes used to be. No representations have yet been made in the matter by the local authorities to this Legation. But Egyptian, Javanese and Italian pilgrims all pay their boat hire as part of an inclusive charge when they buy their ticket at the port of departure. General. 76. Pilgrims who had paid the Government dues were not interfered with, but those who had not were prevented from leaving Jedda for a long time. It is believed, however, that all, or almost all, of these indigent persons were released to make the pilgrimage just in time to get there for the Haj ceremonies. A party of fifty Afghans who objected to paying dues caused a good deal of trouble to the police. Eventually they paid pilgrimage dues for Mecca. But at Medina they had a minor battle with the local police and 'muzawwirs,' and finally got away without paying. 77. A good many destitute pilgrims visited Mecca and Medina on foot. Some came over the Yemen border; Saudi guards were posted on the frontier to stop them, but some got through the cordon. A good many devotees were of weak physique and absolutely without resources; many must have died on the road. (6) Customs. 78. There is nothing new to report about venality and smuggling. The examination of pilgrims' baggage by the customs authorities was often accelerated by a present of a rupee or two.u 79. Indian pilgrims, especially those from Bengal, continued to arrive with large bags of rice. This was charged a heavy duty; the transport charges to Mecca were about 5 rupees per maund; and the result usually was that the pilgrim, sold his rice in Jedda at a loss. 80. The new customs sheds were a great improvement and facilitated the examination of pilgrims' baggage. It meant, however, that the pilgrim was separated from his baggage for some time, and in consequence some baggage went ^ astray. Compensation or recovery was always arranged. 81. There was no change in the customs schedule this year. (7) Religious Policy. 82. There is little to be recorded this year under this head. Wahhabi tenets still apply. A rich Memon who applied for permission to build a mosque at the birthplace of Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, received permission in the first place, but was afterwards told that it could not be sanctioned, as his mosque k ^ might some day be looked upon as a monument. 83. Similarly, Sir Nizamat Jung's proposal to build a library at the birth place of the Prophet was not acceptable to the Government, as they would not permit books other than those approved by Wahhabi ulema to be kept at such a library. 84. The rules against gramophones and drinking still apply, though there is a great deal of gramophone playing in both Jedda and Mecca. 85. The Grand Qazi was responsible for the strict enforcement, under penalty of a fine, of a rule prohibiting the shaving of the chin; but even this rule was more or less forgotten before the pilgrimage really started. 86. The treatment of indigent pilgrims who could not pay their mutawwifs' dues has been reported elsewhere; in effect the same thing happened as last year ; after long detention such persons were released just in time to attend the Haj. (8) Mutawwifs. 87. It is pleasant to be able to record an improvement this year in the general attitude not only of the mutawwifs but also of Indian agitators to this -y Legation in its efforts to look after the Indian pilgrim. Mohammad Khan Ghazi Khan, Chaudhury Mohammad Amin and Ismail Ghaznavi showed no hostility to the new Indian vice-consul, and even went out of their way to help him on occasion. 88. However, mutawwifs have been oppressing ignorant pilgrims for more than 1,300 years and it is too much to hope that they will stop. Rich pilgrims come before poor; the Indian who cannot make himself understood is always liable to exploitation. One complaint, against a certain Seyyid Jamil Abu Saud, was taken up, but could not be brought home to him; there was cause to suspect that he was guilty of speculation, however, and the matter was reported to the Govern ment of India. 89. Only three cases of overcharge were made; though there were many complaints against the artificial rate of exchange which was fixed by a committee controlled by the Naqib on the arrival of each boat. Pilgrims coming from India could evade this difficulty if they changed their money into English sovereigns in | India as advised in the Manual of Instructions. 90. The registration and the rotation systems for Indian pilgrims worked satisfactorily this year. On the request of the Indian vice-consul a representative of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Seyyid Jamil Daud) directed the wakils to assist him in carrying out the details of these systems. The wakils were ^ very willing to assist, once they were given permission to do so. It is true that a confidential circular letter was issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Saudi officials just before the Haj requiring them not to associate with or visit any foreign representative in the Hejaz during the pilgrimage. It looked as if the boycott of previous years would be repeated. But on the intervention of His Majesty's Minister an exception was made in the case of pilgrimage work, and the routine went on normally. 91. The mutawwifs who visited India seem to have behaved as they have usually done in the past. The Saudi Arabian Government are not likely to discourage them from visiting India, as they would expect that the number of pilgrims would decrease if these visits did not take place.92. The rivalry between the Mogul Line and the Scindia Line caused under cutting of rates and enabled many poor persons to come on pilgrimage. The last two boats, in particular, brought a number of semi-destitute beggars, as anyone who could raise 25 or 30 rupees could buy a return ticket from Karachi during the latter half of January 1938. Such persons were unwilling and often unable to pay the Saudi dues, and were detained on arrival and on departure; it is believed that all of them managed to perform the pilgrimage. A separate report has been addressed to the Government of India on the question of destitutes. It may be noted here that the Indian vice-consul was able to take advantage of the low rates prevailing to save the Government of India a considerable sum in fares for returning destitutes; he was also successful in discovering that a considerable number of the so-called destitutes had a certain amount of money; and they were made to pay all or part of their fares. 93. The ' taqrir ' system, whereby one mutawwif has the monopoly of supervision over pilgrims from one district or belonging to one community, still persists in the case of the Memon community and one or two others. The Legation has received a spate of complaints from that community against the neglect which is shown to them by their mutawwif; and a report on the matter has been submitted to the Government of India. There are signs that certain interested persons are seeking similar monopolistic rights over pilgrims from other districts of India, such as Assam and Chittagong. 94. It is an unfortunate fact that the Saudi Arabian Government still look with jealousy and suspicion on the work of the Pilgrimage Office at Jedda. They also realise that without the active co-operation of the mutawwifs it is difficult for the Indian pilgrimage section to carry on their routine work. The situation calls for great tact and diplomacy on the part of the Indian vice-consul. 95. Although the matter is somewhat outside the scope of a report on the annual pilgrimage, it is of interest to record that five pilgrims arrived at Jedda from Karachi on the 23rd September, 1937, having obtained a reduced rate for their passages on the grounds of indigence. Their idea was to travel to the Hejaz in the off-season in order to avoid extra expense. On arrival at Jedda they were surprised to find that mutawwifs' fees had to be paid. They, therefore, applied to this Legation for assistance, stating that it was with the help of the Port Haj Committee that they obtained reduced rates for their steamer fare. Subsequent correspondence elicited the fact that when in Karachi these pilgrims possessed enough funds to pay their mutawwifs' dues, though not enough for their steamer fare. Meanwhile, the pilgrims had, after much argument, managed to obtain permission to go on to Mecca, and have since been lost sight of. 96. Such persons usually conceal their proper financial position in the hope of receiving charity. The Government of India in the course of the corres pondence stated that they proposed to give wide publicity to paragraph 3 of the Manual of Instructions for Pilgrims to the Hejaz, which warns pilgrims failing to pay the taxes and dues that they may have to return to India without performing the Haj. It seems that the local authorities at Jedda are in the habit of asserting this right and of threatening to deport the indigent pilgrim; but that in practice they rarely do so. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 97. The consolidated fee payable on arrival in Jedda remained at £2-81J gold, as last year. 98. The extra charge for travelling in new or ' mumtaz ' vehicles was not maintained this year. 99. All bus fares were alike. 100. The additional charge on account of the ' Eoad Development Scheme ' was maintained, though nothing was done to the roads. Other charges remained unaltered, e.g., car charges between Jedda, Mecca, and Medina; charges for overland pilgrims from Iraq via Medina; charges to Arafat and back; and camel hire to Medina and Arafat. 101. A charge of 3 rupees per pilgrim was collected from almost everyone who entered the inner room of the Kaaba. But no special collection was made for an aerodrome at Jedda. 102. It will thus be seen that the tariff of charges was practically the same as that of last year. The tariff for next year, however, which has been issued&lt;&amp;&gt; 16 much earlier than usual (in July 1938), shows that certain increases of importance are to be made next year : the Saudi Arabian Government will realise from tnem an increase of revenue amounting to some £30,000 gold, assuming that the numbers and itineraries of pilgrims are the same as they were m the 19^0 pilgrimage. (10) Indian Pilgrimage. 103. The Indian pilgrimage began with the arrival of steamship Jehangir on the 25th October, 1937, which also brought the new Indian vice-consul and the new Legation doctor. Arrivals ended with the steamship Akhar on the 5th February, 1938. . . 104. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India and from Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation Province. Total Number of Pilgrims in 1937. in 1938.

These figures were compiled from data supplied by the various Port Haj committees in India. It will be seen that the total number, 16,038, is 800 more than the total number of Indians shown as landing at Jedda in Table (A) of section (2). It is possible that the Jedda authorities have entered 800 Indians as Afghans or Javanese. At any rate, it is clear that the total number of Indian pilgrims rose rather more than 50 per cent, this year. The explanation is partly the extremely low fares which the rate war between the Mogul and the Scindia Lines caused. Ismail Ghaznavi and his friends carried out an intensive propaganda for the Haj, and took full advantage of low fares. Numbers from Bengal and Assam, from the Punjab from Sind, from Baluchistan and from the North-West Frontier Province went up considerably. Pilgrims from Bombay, however, were not quite so numerous as last year : the 1937 figure was abnormally swollen by the visit of the chief priest of the Bohra community. rs X17 106. The following figures show the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports for the 1938 pilgrimage :— 1938. 1937. — 1 j Bombay, j Karachi. Calcutta, j Total.

These figures have also been supplied by the Port Haj Committees.^ It will be seen that the number of Afghans leaving Indian ports is given as 2,677; now most Afghans travel via India, so it appears that the figure given in the Saudi statistics (section (2), Table (A)) for Afghans, viz., 3,709, is probably too large and may contain some Indians; which accords with the supposition mentioned above. At any rate, it is clear that the number of Afghans and Arabs from the Persian Gulf increased considerably, probably owing to the cheaper fares. The visit of the Sheikh of Bahrein also affected the numbers from the Gulf. Chinese from Turkestan were much fewer this year, as the unsettled conditions in the Far East would lead one to expect. The number shown as Saudi (Hejazi- Nejd) subjects represents for the most part returning mutawwifs and similar propagandists; the number of such persons has been increasing steadily in the last three years. 108. The number of Indians who travelled overland is not known. It is thought that it exceeded 300. Pilgrims from Najaf overland via Medina are said to have numbered ninety. 109. Two lines of steamers dealt with the Indian pilgrim traffic this year: The Mogul Line, owned by Messrs. Turner Morrison and Co., and the Scindia Steam Navigation Company (also known as the Haj Line), a new venture, the capital of which is said to be held to some extent by Hindus. 110. The details of the return traffic to India can be seen from the following table :— Dates. Number of ships in port. | Pilgrims awaiting embarkation. Pilgrims despatched. Pilgrims remaining. Ship or ships sailing. 1938— February 17 8 6,994 1,612 5,382 Tslami. February 18 7 6,561 1,388 5,173 Akbar. February 19 6 5,441 2,501 2,940 Rizwani and El- Medina.

It will be seen that the Mogul Line had a steamer sailing from Jedda on almost every one of the first ten days of the departure of pilgrims. The first boat of the Scindia Line, however (steamship Englestan), did not leave till the 2nd March. A good many pilgrims were obliged to wait for a boat in Jedda for as long as twelve days. However, such congestion is very difficult to avoid, and more than half of the pilgrims were got away within the first two weeks after the Haj. No difficulties were encountered this year in booking passages : this duty was carried out under the supervision of the Indian vice-consul. 112. The following table gives the number of ships run, voyages made and pilgrims carried by the two lines outward and homeward :— Outward from India. Homeward to India. Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of Number of Ships. voyages. pilgrims. ships. voyages. pilgrims. 9 20 19,733 9 18 • 18,535 113. The figure of arrivals from India, 19,733, is less than that given in Table (B) of section (2), because the latter figure includes infants, while the shipping company's figures, given above, include only those for whom quarantine dues were payable. The homeward figures include about 250 destitute Indians, who came overland but returned by steamer at reduced rates. Some of those who returned had arrived in the Hejaz some time before the pilgrimage. Eight hundred and forty-six tickets remained on deposit with the Legation. Of the 19,733 arrivals, the Mogul Line brought 16,560 and the Scindia 3,173. About 12,000 of the pilgrims brought by the Mogul Line were on full rates : in the case of the Scindia Line more than 50 per cent, travelled at reduced rates. The Mogul Line employed seven ships, the Scindia two. The former line made sixteen voyages out and thirteen voyages back to India; the rival company made four out and five back. Of the 18,535 returning pilgrims, the Mogul Line took 15,787 and the rival line 2,748. A certain number of pilgrims brought by the Scindia Line at prices similar to 25 or 30 rupees per head for a return ticket were sent back by a Mogul Line boat at full rates, paid by the rival company; it is clear that the Scindia Line has taken a number of passengers at a loss : in fact, to accept pilgrims at 25 rupees per head means really to take them free, as the company has to pay the Kameran fee of 8 rupees as well as the Saudi quarantine and sanitary charges, amounting to 23 rupees, out of the passage money. 114. The following table shows the ports of embarkation and destination of the Indian pilgrims mentioned above :— Pilgrims Port. emharked.

The Indian vice-consul was able to arrange passages without a hitch this year, as he had the full co-operation of the rival shipping agents. Nevertheless, the Scindia Line, having only two ships and dealing with only about 3,000 pilgrims, has perforce to wait longer in port to get their ships full than the Mogul boats had. The latter boats began to sail on the 17th February, while the first Scindia boat did not leave till the 2nd March, just within the fifteen days' limit imposed by the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, section 209 a . It was no doubt galling for Scindia passengers to watch the Mogul boats leaving : the remedy is for them to purchase deposit-paid tickets which will enable them to select the line they fancy for the return voyage. 117. It again proved impossible to run returning boats to a schedule announced in advance. As much notice as possible was given of the departure of each steamer, but the cars of the transport company are always liable to break down, and several unfortunate pilgrims missed their boats in this way. Food, Accommodation, &amp;c. 118. Few complaints about food were received this year on outward voyages from India. Complaints on the return journeys, however, were numerous. It is no doubt extremely difficult for the ship's caterers to cope with the many different tastes of the various classes of pilgrim. Moreover, a number of pilgrims are of some age and unused to travel. With the help of the Amir-ul-Haj and with goodwill from the cooks most of the complaints were dealt with satisfactorily. The problem of the storage of heavy luggage in the hold was dealt with by the despatch of a sub-inspector of Bombay police on one of the ships in order to persuade the pilgrims to let their luggage be stored below. But as this Legation had not been warned of his arrival, the Saudis charged him pilgrim dues, and the Indian vice-consul only obtained exemption for him. 119. As for the collection of baggage of departing pilgrims, M. Sayyid Lai Shah Bukhari was able this year to make a more convenient arrangement than the haphazard system hitherto in force. Instead of all luggage, whether for Egypt, Syria, India or Java being heaped up in the same place and sent out in the same lighters, Sayyid Lai Shah arranged that the luggage for each destination should be stacked and despatched separately. 120. The director of the Kameran Quarantine Station has drawn attention in his report to several instances of overcrowding in certain ships of the Mogul Line. He gives the following instances of excess numbers ; steamship Khosrou carried 1,402 pilgrims when sanctioned for only 1,396; steamship Rahmani took 1,664 when licensed for 1,651; steamships ^4 Mar, Rizwani and Islami carried 10, 23 and 49 extra pilgrims respectively on certain voyages. He considers that children take up a great deal more room than might be expected. The director also noticed that the amount of baggage brought by pilgrims is increasing : he saw camp beds, bicycles, sacks of rice and flour, rolls of carpets, &amp;c., stored between decks; it is evidently advisable that such luggage should be stored in the hold and should not be allowed to take up space allotted for the pilgrims to breathe. . 121. In the year 1937 the Government of India investigated the advisability of issuing return tickets with food to pilgrims proceeding to the Hejaz during the non-pilgrimage season; but the number of pilgrims from whom it was impossible to recover food charges was found to be very small, and the proposal was abandoned. ,1^.1. 122. The usual complaints of lack of space on board pilgrim ships were made by various Indian pilgrims, and proposals for the revision of section S 193 of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923, with the object of providing more room for each pilgrim were reported to have been brought before the Central Assembly. . . 0 1 .,, . . . 123. There would be more room for pilgrims if they could be persuaded to let their heavy luggage be stowed away in the hold. It would be better to endeavour to change the mentality of the average pilgrim in that respect than to increase the space allowed on deck : for the latter would presumably increase the cost of a passage. . cc a • i xt • 124. The usual arrangements about persons acting as Amir-ul-Haj on each boat were made. Of course, they did not please everybody, but the [17847] d 220 system seems a useful one, and provided a useful channel for the ventilation of grievances and for their adjustment by the ships' officers. Pilgrim Passes. 125. The Government of India, for reasons of religious susceptibilities, have decided once more not to agree to a proposal to affix photographs for each pilgrim on his pass. One result has been that it is in practice impossible to check fraud. Anyone who can steal a pass manages to make use of it. As long as local wakils co-operate with this Legation such fraud can be kept within limits : but such co-operation is always liable to break down, as it did in the 1937 pilgrimage. The Indian Section issued 200 duplicate passes this year to pilgrims who had lost their documents, and 191 emergency passes were issued to pilgrims who had travelled overland on foot and had no documents with them. The increase in the number of duplicate passes this year is explained by the greater number of indigent pilgrims : the mutawwifs confiscated their passes on arrival, and when they were released from a long confinement, their passes, having no photographs, could not be identified or were in some way missing. Refunds on Deposit-paid Passes and Return Tickets. 126. The established system worked satisfactorily. Certain pilgrims having come on one line desired to return via another line, and claimed refunds on their tickets booked by the first line. In accordance with article S 208 C of the regulations such refunds had to be refused. Registration. 127. The established arrangements continued to work well this year, owing to the co-operation of the local wakils. Out of 16,038 Indian pilgrims who arrived by sea, 15,367 registered themselves at this Legation, i.e., only 671 failed to deposit their return tickets in the Indian Section. Allowing for a certain number of these who had only single tickets, it will be seen that there were only very few who did not register. Fifty-nine unclaimed return tickets or deposit-paid passes remain in the Legation and will be forwarded to India in due course. 128. Ten Indian and seventeen foreign pilgrims reported the loss of their return tickets. Passes were made out for them as usual. Rotation System. 129. His Majesty's Minister discussed this system with Fuad Bey Hamza before the pilgrimage, and as a result the Jedda wakils gave their full support to the Indian vice-consul in carrying out the details of the rotation system, whereby the principle of 'first come, first away' was rigidly applied. It meant that the booking arrangements had to be made under the strict supervision of the Indian vice-consul, and the two shipping agents lent their aid in working out the details. Hyderabad State Caravan. 130. Moulana Abdul Qader Mohi-ud-Din was again the ' Kafila-Salar ' or commander of the State pilgrimage. He made excellent arrangements for his pilgrims. But he expressed his dissatisfaction with the mutawwifs. Destitutes. 131. About the same number of destitutes as last year applied for repatria tion. The Indian vice-consul was, however, able to deal with them at a much lower cost than last year. He had noticed from certain indications, and also by inference from the statements of Indians he met on the road to Medina and who talked to him not knowing what his position was, that some of these so-called destitutes really possessed a certain amount of money. On his offering to send off these persons without delay as soon as they arrived, provided they would pay something towards the cost of their ticket, 'he was able to send off the first batch of eighty without cost to the Government of India. Some pilgrims were sent off after having paid 10/- per head; and, finally, the last batch of eighty- three, who had no money at all for their fares, was sent off by steamship Jehangir on the 15th May, the Mogul Line having very generously agreed to take them at 20 rupees per head.21 132. Details of the persons repatriated in this way are given below {a) Provinces of origin— Bengal Sind Punjab Assam United Provinces North-West Frontier Province ...

These 177 persons do not include the eighty who were sent off first at no cost to Government. The total cost borne by the Government of India in respect of repatriation of destitutes this year was'1,836 rupees 4^ O. 134. A full report has been rendered to the Government of India this year on the subject of destitutes. It has been shown that there are two main sorts of destitutes : (1) those who take their ticket at the Indian port but who when they land at Jedda have no money to pay the local dues, and (2) those who travel somehow by dhow to the southern shores of the Arabian peninsula usually without passes or money, and who beg their way, walking, to the Yemen'frontier and thence (if they succeed m avoiding the Saudi guards who lie in wait for them) to Mecca. Category (1) might be eliminated by requiring such pilgrims to deposit a sum equal to the Saudi dues at the Indian port when they purchase their ticket at the Indian port of embarkation. Category (2) might be controlled or reduced by a stricter supervision over dhows leaving the shores of Baluchistan lor ArciDici. Publicity. , 0 135 -.

Sayyid Lai Shah Bukhari, M.A., of the Punjab Civil Service, took charge of the pilgrimage section on his arrival in October 1937. He has had a very successful first season, and has handled the various problems with much energy and resource. The two clerks, Mr. Shah Jehan Kabir and Mr. Iqbal Din, again did excellent work, their past experience being of great value, and Munshi F. A. Qazi was employed during the rush period. (11) Afghan Pilgrimage. 138. More than twice the number of Afghans came on pilgrimage this year than last. The number this year was 3,709, and last year 1,756. The cheap fares prevailing in Karachi and Bombay owing to the rate war had a good deal to do with the increase. 139. The Afghan Legation here took little interest in its destitutes, who were numerous this year. Those who could not pay their dues were not financed by their Legation. 140. The Afghan Minister continued to reside in Egypt, although he is accredited to Saudi Arabia and not (it is believed) to Egypt as well. He paid a hurried visit to Medina after the Haj and rushed back to Cairo, leaving his first secretary in charge. 141. An Indian doctor named Dr. Rashid-ud-Din, M.B., B.S., from the Punjab came to the Hejaz a few weeks before the Haj as medical officer for Afghan pilgrims; he returned to Kabul shortly after the pilgrimage. (12) Malay Pilgrimage. 142. The pilgrimage season from the Malay point of view started with the departure of the first ship from Singapore on the 8th September, 1937, and ended with the departure of the last ship to leave Jedda for Singapore on the 18th March, 1938. The Blue Funnel Line took all the traffic, there being nine journeys outward and six homeward. 143. The total number of pilgrims of the usual mixed nationalities (Malays, Javanese, Philippines and Saudi Arabs) who arrived at Jedda from Malayan ports was 7,868. Out of this, according to the register, 4,589 were Malays (excluding infants), made up as follows :— Straits Settlements— Singapore Penang and Province Wellesley Malacca Labuan Federated Malay States— Perak ...

Assistance to Pilgrims. + . • I 45 ' No finan oial assistance was granted through the Legation to pilgrims amLntine^oTn^fir f or; but grants from the Government of Perak amounting to 1,118 dollars were distributed among their nominees Quite a rpQnt' GOT '®™ men t officers and Government servants, together with their pemSwn toTavc thTn reco , mmended , to the Saudi Arab authorities for permission to leave the Hejaz by an earlier ship than the ones bv which thev were entitled to leave, according to the local ' rule of rotation,' that iT the rule whereby pilgrims were released from Mecca according to the order in which they arrived m this country. This was done in order to enable the applicants to resume duty before the expiry of their leave; but in some cases wherecSltes eave were not available, the statement had to be accepted on the applicant's word. Refunds on 109 tickets of deceased pilgrims were received from the s ippmg agents at Jedda and paid to their respective next-of-kin in Mecca during the season Medical assistance to Malay pilgrims remained as in the previous years under the control of the Dutch Medical Mission in Mecca whose aXhrMX™ii aPPear t0 6 fUlly taxed by attending t0 both the Javanese Cost of the Pilgrimage. . 146 : The only shipping company dealing with Malay pilgrim traffic raised toTJddlaJf y ®? r / 0l ; a f retur n de ck Passage, including food, from 181 dollars to 215 dollars.

In assessing rates for children, the Saudi Arabian Government followed a new plan this year: children under 5 years of age were chareed rates ^ be tween 5 and 10 were charged half-rates, and those over 10 full24 Deceased Pilgrims. 149. The total number of deaths among Malay pilgrims this year was 223 r including ten who died on the voyage out. This works out at 4-7 per cent, of the total number. The effects of twenty-five pilgrims who died last year without having any friend who could take charge of their effects were handed over by the Saudi authorities to the Malay vice-consul during this season. Among those who died was the Hon. Engku Mohamed-bin-Khalid of Johore, a cousin of his Highness the Sultan of Johore. He died at Mecca. Pilgrim Passes. 150. This year, for the first time, a pass was issued to each pilgrim above the age of 1 year. Miscellaneous. 151. The revised Merchant Shipping Ordinance of the Straits Settlements Government affecting changes in the amounts of refunds on unused and on deceased pilgrims' tickets proved to be an important factor, among others, in bringing about the removal (as an experiment) of the control on the issue of return tickets to the pilgrims this year; otherwise, owing to the large number, an extra assistant to the Malay pilgrimage officer might have had to be engaged to cope with the work. For the first time, gratis tickets were issued by the shipping company to babies under 1 year of age accompanying their parents on pilgrimage. 152. The Malays residing in the Hejaz exhibited a good deal of indignation at the imposition of a registration charge on foreigners residing in this country. A deputation which waited on the Malay pilgrimage officer whilst at Mecca was informed that the Saudi authorities were entitled to impose such a registration fee, which is similar to those levied on foreigners by many other countries. 153. The secretary to the Government of Kedah, Haji Muhammad Sheriff, C.B.E., in an interview with His Majesty's Minister, raised the point that the Hejaz custom of classing together the inhabitants of Malaya and of the Nether lands East Indies as &lt;£ people of Java ' is not always agreeable to Malayans. It happened that the local newspaper, in reporting the departure of Mr. Sheriff, referred to him as belonging to Kedah, 'one of the parts of Java.' His Majesty's Minister took advantage of this sad ignorance of geography to write to the Amir Feisal on the matter. The Amir replied that no superiority or inferiority was implied by this long-established terminology. However, he said that all Hejaz newspapers had been informed that they should call everyone by the name of his own nation. Staff. 154. Staff arrangements were exactly the same as last year; Haji Abdul Majid and Haji Mohammed Jamil again applied their long experience to the problems of the pilgrimage with pronounced success. (13) Sudanese Pilgrimage. 155. According to Saudi quarantine returns, which this year tend to err on the side of generosity, 2,054 Sudanese pilgrims disembarked at Jedda, as compared with the total of 1,851 computed by the Sudan Government as having embarked at Suakin. The latter figure shows an increase of 193 on last year's total of 1,658. The relatively small number of fourteen emergency certificates were issued during the return season to Sudanese pilgrims who claimed to have lost their travel documents, and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. were, as usual, good enough to provide them with free passages to Suakin. 156. Mutawwifs' dues remained on the reduced scale which was standardised in 1936, and the sum fixed for collection purposes this year was £E. 2 170 mm. Again this year the mutawwifs experienced great difficulty in collecting their dues, which all pilgrims, irrespective of nationality, are required to pay immediately on landing at Jedda. A large number of Sudanese pilgrims25 applied to the Legation for monetary assistance on landing, to enable them to pay their mutawwifs' dues; not one of them had more than 75 Egyptian piastres in his pocket, and many of them possessed only 40 to 50 piastres. Their applications were refused, but to enable them to perform the pilgrimage, their mutawwifs were promised that a loan of £rE. 1,500 mm. would be advanced to their indigent charges after the pilgrimage (see paragraphs 167 and 168 of last year's report). 157. It has been suggested that the adoption of a suitable form of paid-up pilgrim pass scheme, whereby an intending pilgrim would be required to deposit a fixed sum of money with the authorities in the Sudan, which would be refunded to the pilgrims at Jedda after the pilgrimage, would help to eliminate the possibility of indigent pilgrims embarking at Suakin. This question is now the subject of correspondence between this Legation and the Sudan Government. 158. During the return season the large number of 212 pilgrims were each advanced the sum £E. 1,500 mm., which, in the large majority of cases, was immediately handed over to their mutawwifs. 159. This year's pilgrimage was unique in that no serious complaints were received by the Legation from returning pilgrims regarding the inadequacy of shipping facilities. The enlargement of the quarantine accommodation at Suakin, and the reduced period of quarantine from five to three days, which was still further reduced towards the end of the pilgrimage to about twenty-four hours, were mainly responsible for this highly satisfactory state of affairs. The Khedivial Mail Line were also more accommodating in their allotment of steamers, thanks largely to the untiring efforts of the commissioner at Port Sudan. 160. Prominent among Sudanese pilgrims were: Hussein Abdel Aseem Khalifa, a native District Commissioner, Sheikh Ahmad Eabih Abu Ku', a section sheikh of the Kenana tribe, and Sheikh Saboonabi, a religious notable of the Fung tribe, who was accompanied by a large number of followers. 161. Repatriation of Sudanese : — (a) Applications considered (b) Applicants repatriated (c) Applicants assisted (d) Applications still under reference ... 162. The Sudan Government proposed during the year that a medical mission from the Sudan might with advantage accompany the Sudanese pilgrims to the Hejaz. His Majesty's Minister did not welcome this suggestion : he pointed out that the delegate of the International Quarantine Board at Alexandria was already charged with the duty of collecting and transmitting to the Board information of medical interest concerning the pilgrimage, from his arrival some weeks before the Haj to the moment when his board declares the pilgrimage clean. Sir Reader William Bullard considered that a Sudan mission would not be able to glean much more information than this delegate, and that as the Saudi Arabian Government did not welcome such missions, it was doubtful whether in present circumstances the proposal was worth following up. The Sudan Government agreed. (14) West African Pilgrimage. 163. According to Saudi quarantine returns, 6,046 West African pilgrims arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year via Suakin, an increase of 1,460 on last y ear's total of 4,586. The large majority of these pilgrims were natives of British West Africa. They were, as usual, carried to and from the Sudan in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. No West Africans are shown in the Saudi returns as having disembarked this year at the southern ports of Lith and Qunfida. Some fifty-six emergency certificates were issued to pilgrims who satisfactorily proved the loss of their pilgrim passes, and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Go. were &lt;again good to provide most of them with free passages to Suakin. 164. Only ninety West Africans travelled under the auspices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme this year, compared with seventy-nine last year. At the time of writing this report sixty-two of them have collected their return tickets and the balance of their deposits. The scheme worked smoothly this year, and nominal lists together with return tickets and duplicate pilgrim passes were received from the Sudan by the same ship on which the pilgrims travelled [17847] E 1 Nil 3 Nil26 165.

This decrease is mainly in respect of pilgrims from Italian Somaliland. 167. The Somali ratings of H.M.S. Londonderry, which was visiting Jedda during the Haj, were unable to perform the pilgrimage this year owing to the early departure of the vessel from Jedda. 168. During the return season thirty-one Somali pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £120. 169. Repatriation of Somalis :— (a) Applications deserving of consideration ... 3 \b) Applicants repatriated ... ...

According to Saudi quarantine returns 736 Palestinian and Trans- Jordanian pilgrims entered the country this year; 600 through the port of Jedda, and 76 via Yanbu. This figure closely corresponds with the total of 725 given by the Government of Palestine as having registered with the Palestine Depart ment of Health as intending pilgrims, and shows an increase of 308 on last year's figure of 428. The large majority of Palestinian and Trans Jordanian pilgrims travelled to and from the Hejaz in ships of the Misr Steamship Line. 171. As usual, no figures are available regarding those who travelled overland. Only four persons in this category came to the notice of the Legation, when they applied for repatriation on the grounds of destitution. 172. The Government of Palestine were again good enough to sanction the local engagement of a clerical assistant. Hassan Effendi Kamel, a Sudani (see paragraph 179 of last year's report), was again employed in this capacity, and although the clerical work involved was considerably heavier this year he discharged his onerous duties to the complete satisfaction of the officer who deals with this section of the pilgrimage. 173. Applications for refunds of deposits during the return season were proportionately high. A total of £590 105. was advanced to 142 Palestinian, and four Transjordan pilgrims. 174. The preferential treatment accorded to Egyptian pilgrims by the Egyptian Legation, and the officials of the Misr Steamship Line in the matter of the allotment of accommodation during the return season has already been alluded to in paragraph 31 above. To obviate possible misunderstanding in the future, pilgrims will be informed before their departure from Palestine and Transjordan that if they are permitted to travel on steamers chartered by the Egyptian Government, prior consideration will be accorded to Egyptian pilgrims during the return season. 175. A comparatively unsuccessful attempt was made by the Palestine Islamic Committee to use the pilgrimage as a vehicle for the circulation of anti- British propaganda. Large quantities of pamphlets, illustrated to show the alleged desecration of religious literature and other similar acts by the British in Palestine, and said to have been printed in Syria, were brought to the Hejaz from Beirut by Taha Abu Saud, of Jaffa, a member of the Islamic Committee, and others. A few pamphlets were discreetly distributed in Jedda, and some in Mecca, but most of them were confiscated by the King, who forbade their distribution in this country. 176. Repatriation of Palestinians and Transjordanians :— {a) Applications deserving of consideration ... 4 (&amp;) Applicants repatriated ... Nil (c) Applications still under reference Nil27 177. A number of Transjordanians made the pilgrimage overland, instead of making use of the recognised route via Palestine or via Maan and Aqaba. The Transjordan Government is in process of organising facilities for pilgrims via Mudawara : 267 outgoing and 652 returning pilgrims used that route this year. Some were inoculated at Muaqqar, a few miles east of Amman; and adequate arrangements were made by a medical officer at Mudawara on return for control and quarantine measures, and for the feeding of destitute pilgrims. This route, not being recognised at the pilgrimage conference at Beirut in 1929, was not open to Syrians. Nevertheless, certain parties of Syrians attempted, some successfully, to cross Transjordan territory via Kaf on their way to the pilgrimage. (17) Muscati, Bahreini, and Koweiti Pilgrimages. 178. Saudi quarantine returns show that 146 Muscati pilgrims arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year, and 134 are shown as having disembarked at Lith and Qunfida. No figures are available regarding those who came overland. 179. According to the ' Koweit Intelligence Summary ' No. 17 of December 1937, some 380 pilgrims had left Koweit for the collecting point at Jahara village. A not altogether successful attempt was made this year by the newly formed Nejd Car Company (a quasi-Government concern) to carry pilgrims from Koweit via Riyadh to Medina and Mecca, and from Ujair via Hofuf and Riyadh to Mecca, but no figures are available regarding the number of passengers carried. 180. The Ruler of Bahrein, His Highness Sir Hamad-ibn-Isa-al-Khalifa, K .C .I .E., C.S .I., &amp;c., accompanied by eighteen followers disembarked at Jedda from H.M.S. Londonderry on the 22nd January. He was met on board by His Majesty's Minister and the Amir Feisal, Viceroy of Hejaz, and on shore by His Royal Highness the Amir Saud. His Highness left the same afternoon for Mecca. After the pilgrimage His Highness accompanied by some ninety followers embarked at Jedda on the steamship Islami on the 17th February for Karachi. 181. No Muscati, Bahreini or Koweiti pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (18) Pilgrimages of Inhahitants of the Colony and Protectorate of A den. 182. According to Saudi quarantine returns 559 natives of the Colony and the Protectorate of Aden arrived in Jedda on pilgrimage this year, and thirty-one pilgrims are shown as having disembarked at the southern port of Lith. As usual, no figures are available regarding those who travelled overland. 183. During the return season 203 emergency certificates were issued to natives of the Aden Protectorate, as compared with 140 over a similar period last year. There has been a greater exodus of Hadhramis of the semi-settled class this year, owing to the tax imposed on foreign residents under the recently promul gated Residence Regulations.' 184. Shipping arrangements during the return season worked relatively smoothly, and the few complaints received by the Legation were satisfactorily dealt with. 185. Repatriation of natives of Aden Colony and Protectorate :— {a) Applications deserving of consideration ... 39 (&amp;) Applicants repatriated Nil (c) Applicants assisted 29 (19) South African Pilgrimage. 186. According to Saudi quarantine returns seventy-six South African pilgrims entered the country via the port of Jedda this year. They were, as usual, people of some means, who entered and left the country unostentatiously. 187. No South African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (20) Zanzibari and East African Pilgrimages. 188. Saudi quarantine returns show that 247 Zanzibari and East African pilgrims disembarked at Jedda this year, an increase of 147 on last year's total of 100.28 year. 189. No Zanzibar! or East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this (21) Sarawak Pilgrimage. 190. No less than 111 Sarawakis came on pilgrimage this year ; a record figure for the last ten years. Ninety-two of them returned to Sarawak alter the pilgrimage; sixteen elected to stay in the Holy Land for a year or so, and at least one of the remaining three has had the privilege of dying at Mecca. (22) Abyssinian and French Somali Pilgrimage. 191 A magnificently equipped Italian troop-ship, steamship carry ing a regular naval officer, brought 616 pilgrims from Mogadiscio She had a very large hospital, shower-baths, and porcelain wash-basins : her pilgrims were very happv though two of them died. A few further details gathered from reports from Harar may be added here. The Italian authorities organised the pilgrimage throughout. Each pilgrim paid 3,000 lire to the Government before his departure, and incurred no further expenses. It is evident that that sum was not enougn to cover all the services rendered, so that Italian Government funds must have made up the difference. Generous rations of tea, sugar, rice, butter and other tood were distributed daily; one cook was allotted to every ten persons; m the Hejaz one sheep or goat was issued to every six persons, and each pilgrim received a dollar a day for personal expenses. A few boys under 12 years of age were taken tree of charge 192. The total number of pilgrims brought by the Sannio was reported to be 660 from Mogadiscio and 560 from Massawa. 193. The retort of the French authorities at Jibuti was the despatch ot an organised party under the Sultan of Tajura, accompanied by Sheikh Omar-al- Ashari, an Italophobe notable, but according to local reports only twenty-eight French Somalis came in this party.A \ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS^BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOYERNMENT E ASTEBN (A rabia) . iNFrDENTIAL. ;— BUSHIRE RESIDENCY■ A V&gt;.,. ...

My Lord, _ ^ Jedda, September 5, 1939. 1 HAVE the honour to forward herewith the annual report on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places of the Hejaz for 1939. 2. I am indebted to the same officers as last year for reports on the various aspects of the pilgrimage, i.e., to Mr. Lai Shah Bukhari, the Indian Vice-Consul, for the Indian pilgrimage, to Haji Abdul Majid for the Malay pilgrimage, to Dr. Ghulam Easul for the quarantine and health sections, and' to Mr. Ousman for most of the nationalities other than Indian and Malay. I have again adhered strictly to the general lines of the previous report. 3. I venture to draw attention to the confidential nature of the report. It contains certain critical reflections on Saudi policy which, if seen by certain mischief-makers in India, might be reported by them to Saudi authorities to the detriment of our good relations with them. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to the Government of India (External Affairs Department), the Government of India (Department of Education, Health and Lands), and the Governor of the Straits Settlements. I have, &amp;c. A. C. TROTT. Enclosure. P ilgrimage R eport, 1939. (1) Introductory and General. SINCE the last report was written several indications have shown, even more clearly than before, that the chief interest the Saudi Arabian Government have in the pilgrimage is to make money out of it. The most direct proof of this is a statement made by Dr. Hamouda, the second official representative of the Government at a recent meeting of the International Health Office in Paris. Dr. Hamouda, after stating his country's desire that the international require ments for pilgrims as regards air space should be rendered more rigorous still so that less persons could travel on any one ship, explained that they did not mind the resulting increase in fare for each pilgrim, because what they wanted was not more pilgrims of every sort, but more rich pilgrims, in order that they could spend more money in Saudi Arabia. It is true that the speaker also stated that every pilgrim on landing was inoculated against typhoid, a statement which is completely untrue, and that the first delegate, Khalid-al-Hud, was sent with Dr. Hamouda largely in order to curb the latter's tendency to prevarication; but the first delegate did not deny the astonishing confession that the Wahhabis look upon the pilgrimage primarily as a means of making money. The treatment of destitute pilgrims bears out the same theory; these unfortunates seem to be treated more and more severely as the years go on; during the last pilgrimage they were made to beg till they collected enough money to pay the large pilgrimage dues. A third indication of a desire to make sure of having fees paid in advance is the proposal, hitherto abortive, to make all shipping companies collect in advance the Saudi fees for each pilgrim at the same time as he purchases his ticket. [20207] bqu 2. Of course, there is a good deal of criticism from the pilgrims, especially from Indians, Iraqis and Egyptians, all of whom are beginning to realise what good government ought to mean. It is often stated that pilgrims were really better treated in the bad old days when there were Bedouin lying in wait for them on all the roads; the misery of those days is forgotten, and present taxation is remembered instead. It is said that in the old days mutawwifs who oppressed pilgrims used to be punished, but that there is now no check on them. The Minister of Finance, who has a pretty free hand in pilgrimage matters, is said to listen to no complaints, but to confine himself to insisting that all dues must be paid by every pilgrim. It is impossible to deny, what every thinking pilgrim must see for himself, that the transport charges are enormous and the roads execrable; apologists of this regime may say that the sums accruing from &lt;c kushan ' or road taxes are accumulating somewhere and will be spent on road construction soon, but that is small comfort to the man who has paid them and seen nothing result. 3. On the other hand, it is known that the King takes an interest in pilgrimage matters; he makes a special journey to the Hejaz and holds several banquets; the Minister of Finance always says he will investigate thoroughly all complaints; and some pilgrims must be very tiresome to deal with. Moreover, now that considerable sums are coming in to the Royal exchequer from the new Hasa oil royalty, it is to be hoped that the hint that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin once threw out, that the King Would gradually reduce taxation of the pilgrims whenever he could, will be fulfilled. Nevertheless, the opposite tendency, that new resources create new appetites, may come into play. At any rate, it is clear that at the present moment the Saudi Arabian Government are exploiting their monopoly in a pretty harsh manner. 4. As for the political situation, there is no change to report. The new oil concession has been referred to above; the port of Ras Tanura is rapidly being developed and exportation of oil is going on rapidly, with royalties of 4^. (gold) per ton accruing to the Government. The German Minister in Iraq has been accredited to Saudi Arabia and visited that country about pilgrimage time. The Japanese Minister to Egypt also visited the King. The Sheikh of Bahrein received a cordial visit from his Saudi cousin, and most cordial relations exist between the two. 5. Prince Mohammad Ali, heir presumptive to King Faruq of Egypt, performed the pilgrimage returning by aeroplane, and a good deal of propaganda was made to increase the number of Egyptian pilgrims; but actually the number was lower than last year. 6. The usual army of propagandists invaded the Moslem world, with the exception of Turkey and Iran; but the total number of overseas pilgrims fell short of last year's figure by about 5,000. This decrease is attributed to less favourable economic conditions in the East Indies and Egypt. Pilgrims from Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland came at Government expense, as last year, but do iiot seem to have done much good in regard to propaganda for the Duce. 7. Difficulties about the Moslem calendar seem inseparable from the pilgrimage. This year the Government announced, a day or two in advance, that the official Haj date would be Monday, the 30th January. So the hopes of a Haj-Akbar, when the great day falls on a Friday, were again unfulfilled, as they have been for about ten years past. Some 100,000 pilgrims assembled at Arafat, and in spite of showers of rain everything passed off as usual and there were few casualties or illnesses. 8. Measures to protect the life of the King and other important members of the Royal family were taken in the haram and outside it At Muna when pilgrims were ushered in to file past the King they were made to pass through a double row of Saudi officials, who, under pretext of leading them to the King, felt their clothes and pockets lest they should be armed. 9. The improvement in the general economic condition of the country has been alluded to already. Oil royalties and payments by the flourishing gold mine at Mahd Dhabab must have swelled the Royal income by several thousands of gold pounds; but no relief to the poor pilgrim has yet been observed. 10. Sir Nizamat Jung's present to the Saudi Arabian Government of 12,000 rupees for the construction of a rest-house at Rabigh on the road to Medina, was entrusted by the Government to the son of the Amir of, that place;but as yet there is no rest-house. The chief engineer to the Hyderabad State, Nawab Ahsan Yar Jung Bahadur, had a strange experience of Saudi taxation; by order of the Nizam he brought with him a well-made model of a library which it was proposed to erect at the birth-place of the prophet; he was charged customs dues for importing the model. His proposal to light Medina at the expense of the Nizam's Government was discussed, but the Saudi Arabian Government laid down certain conditions about guaranteeing running costs which have caused, at any rate, a temporary hitch. 11. The Nawab of Banganapalle is reported to have performed the pilgrimage this year via Iraq. He appears to have approached King Abdul Aziz, through the Iraq ulema, for permission to reconstruct, at his own expense, the tombs of a few Imams buried in the Jannat Baqieh at Medina, which were razed to the ground when the Wahhabis established themselves in the Hejaz. Nothing happened, and it is doubtful if the message even reached the King; it is very unlikely that such a request would have been granted. 12. The Saudi currency, which is supposed to be pegged to gold at the rate of 20 Saudi riyals to 1 pound gold, varied a good deal at pilgrimage time, and cannot be said to be stabilised. It appreciated during the rush time of the pilgrimage when everybody wanted riyals : and in the slack times it sank to about 24 to the gold pound. 13. Saudi aviation is in a state of quiescence. The Italian mission has been sent away, and several semi-trained pilots are now being instructed in Egypt. The Saudi aviation fund still appears to exist, for the Mehtar of Chitral gave a donation to it. Allusion will be found in section (5) to the absence of an air service run by the Banque Misr from Jedda to Medina. The Saudi road taxes, payable by vehicles which use the air as well as the roads, proved prohibitive. 14. More Indian propagandists than usual came on pilgrimage this year. Ismail Ghaznawi came accompanied by Abdul Aziz, the editor of Ghaznawi's paper the Khadim-i-Ka'ba. No privileges were given to them on arrival; they were not exempted from payment of customs dues or Saudi pilgrimage dues; nor was Ismail Ghaznawi invited to the King's banquet. However, he seemed to be on good terms with some of the Saudi officials. And he was not obstructive to the Indian vice-consul. He is reported to have received his present from the king, but his request for a car in which to carry on propaganda in India was not granted. Mohammad Khan and Mohammad Amin were also present; they endeavoured to neutralise Ismail Ghaznawi. Dr. Shafi Ahmed of Delhi also came, after an interval of some years. His line was to advise pilgrims not to take their complaints to the British Legation in case they might suffer in con sequence from the resentment of the local authorities; however, such intrigues had little or no effect. Maulana Hasrat Muhani, a prominent member of the Moslem League, went to Syria after the pilgrimage in order to interview the Mufti, but his efforts failed. It is reported that the Saudi Arabian Government paid his passage to Syria. Maulana Obeidullah Sindhi, a Moslem of note who had resided in Mecca for ten years, was finally allowed by the Government of India to return to India, and he did so after the pilgrimage. 15. The relations between the Finance Minister and the Indian vice-consul were excellent, and current questions were settled without difficulty by direct reference to the Minister. Other Saudi officials, including those of the quaran tine, also co-operated with Seyyid Lai Shah in various ways. 16. The Black-List system is still maintained, the names on the list being decided on by the Government of India. A certain control is also exercised in this way on Malay mutawwifs. One, Muhammad Ali Yamani-al-Zamzami, convicted of assault in Singapore, has been refused a visa, and his petition, in which he made the untrue statement that he had a wife and children in Singapore, has been rejected. 17. The Banque Misr barges were not used this year : the reason being that the Saudi authorities insisted on collecting the dhow charges in spite of the fact that the Banque Misr was paying for the barges. The new Banque Misr Hotel in Mecca was patronised by the rich class of pilgrim. The upper part was reserved for Prince Mohammad Ali and his sister Princess Khadija Abbas during their short stay. [20207] b 2C\lfl 4 18. Foreign residents still have to pay the annual registration fee of 10 riyals : a charge t© which the considerable number of foreign Moslems settled in this country violently object. They also object to paying the koshan tax levied on all foreigners who use the roads. 19. Little attention seems to have been paid to the Palestine question during the pilgrimage, though subscriptions for the Arabs of Palestine were collected. The Government permitted no meetings or other outward manifestations of anti- Jew feeling. 20. The complications caused by the arrival of destitute pilgrims have been dealt with elsewhere in this report. The Saudi Arabian Government officially requested this legatiop this year to restrain destitutes as far as possible : however, owing to the cheap fares about 500 more or less indigent persons, more than last year, eventually arrived from India. Not one was refused permission to land—the Saudi Government cannot risk such obvious interference with religious observance—but all were subjected to various kinds of pressure, and either found the money somehow or were released at the last moment. The next move was the issue of a circular to the legations announcing that the Saudi Arabian Govern ment had ' decided ' that in future shipping companies should collect pilgrimage dues at the ports of embarkation : the new tariffs on that basis were actually prepared and despatched to Malaya. Although the Italians accepted and the Egyptians were already working on a similar scheme, there was great opposition from the Far East, from India, from the French, &amp;c. The shipping companies in those countries take the reasonable view that {a) such a ' decision ' cannot be legally binding outside Saudi Arabia; (h) to put up the apparent fare in this way would greatly affect the volume of traffic, always sensitive and elastic to financial considerations; and (c) the companies were being made to collect Saudi charges to their own hurt. Faced with determined criticism from the Dutch and the French as well as from this legation, the Saudis eventually agreed to postpone their plan for a year. 21. Security remained good throughout the country ; though a few cases of pilfering at Mecca were reported by the Malayan pilgrims. 22. The King held two banquets for distinguished pilgrims, and more than 200 Indian pilgrims managed to get invitations. At one of them an Indian barrister from Peshawar name Abdul Aziz made an unexpected speech; the King followed it by a religious oration, and the Hyderabad ' Qafila Salar,' or leader of the pilgrims, Abdul Qadir Muhi-ud-Din, made a speech in praise of the Saudi management of the pilgrimage; some of his flock had hoped that he would seize the opportunity to point out a few home-truths, but the mellowness caused by a good dinner, together with the awkwardness of criticising the host, restrained the orator and a unique opportunity of ventilation of grievances was lost. 23. Among the important persons who made the pilgrimage this year were the following: — His Highness the Mehtar of Chitral, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Hassan Suhrawardy, Syed Hassan Ali, M.L.A. (United Provinces); Raja Mohammad Akram (Punjab), Nawab Ahsan Yar Jung Bahadur of Hyderabad, Prince Mohammad Ali of Egypt and his sister Khadija Abbas, and the brother of the Afghan Minister. 24. Arrangements for the return of Indian pilgrims worked very smoothly this year. 25. H.M.S. Weston (Lieutenant-Commander Segrave) visited Jedda the Haj week, and the usual regatta was held. 26. The Afghan Minister stayed in the Hejaz for a longer period than usual, perhaps because he felt it might be his last chance. He was seldom seen at Jedda, and the number of Afghan pilgrims was less than usual, a fact which the Saudi Arabian Government were inclined to attribute to the Minister's obstructive policy. It, at any rate, appears that the Afghan representatives here are more concerned to catch out persons who have wrongly declared themselves Afghan subjects at Bombay than to help Afghans out of difficulties. 27. With regard to the proposal referred to in paragraph 28 of the 1938 report, it has now been decided that ships transporting Indian pilgrims shouldland the Karachi pilgrims at that port instead of taking them to Bombay if the number bound for Karachi reaches eighty. 28. There is now quite a colony of ' Bukharis ' or refugees from Central Asia settled at Mecca, where their native shrewdness has made them such serious competitors of the more indolent Meccans in various departments of business that it has been proposed to confine them in a separate colony on the outskirts of Mecca. 29. An extraordinary story about 1,000 pilgrims from Bokhara or Hsinkiang has been heard from more than one source: it is that all of them save one were murdered by Russians before they reached India or Afghanistan. 30. Nearly 2,000 pilgrims came via Najaf by the overland route, and nearly 1,000 were entered as Iranians. It might be supposed that this increase in the number of Iranian Hajis showed the influence of the recent Egyptian matrimonial alliance. Actually, however, most of the Iranians came from outside Iran, or had got out of Iran on other pretexts than that of the pilgrimage. 31. A good many Japanese propagandists visited the country and endeavoured to explain what their country's ' new order ' really meant. Their efforts were countered by a deputation of Chinese students from A1 Azhar University, Cairo, who told a very different story. The principal Japanese propagandist from Japan was a certain Tang Yi-chen, and he seemed to be anxious to avoid a ' Bokharan ' pilgrim guide's son named Yahya, who is also understood to be in Japanese pay. 32. Correspondence again passed between the legation, the Government of India, and the Saudi Arabian Government concerning the space to be allotted to children under 1 year of age. It will be remembered that article 100 of the International Sanitary Convention of Paris, 1926, reckons such infants as accountable in assessing the space available in pilgrim ships ; whereas the Indian Merchant Shipping Act states that children under 1 year of age need not be reckoned in. The Saudi Arabian Government finally agreed to prolong, for the present pilgrimage season, the existing informal arrangement whereby such infants have not been reckoned, and it is understood that the Indian Merchant Shipping Act is being amended so as to bring it into line with the Paris Conven tion on that point. 33. The text of an agreement between the Egyptian and the Palestine Governments concerning the transit of Palestinian pilgrims through Egyptian territory was published in the Bulletin Quarantenaire of the 21st December, 1938. As far as this legation is aware arrangements for this transit traffic worked smoothly this pilgrimage. The vexed question of precedence in returning Egyptian boats was not heard of this year, perhaps owing to a decline in the number of pilgrims ; it seems that the Egyptian Legation was being generous to the Palestinians and was not applying strictly a principle which we could hardly have contested, viz., that since the shipping arrangements are made by the Egyptian Government, Egyptian pilgrims are entitled to return-berths before Palestinians. (2) Statistics. 34. The following tables, compiled from information collected unofficially by the Indian Vice-Consul, give the usual statistical information. The increase in the number of Indian pilgrims is no doubt due to the extremely low rates charged towards the end of the pilgrimage season by the rival Indian shipping companies. But the total number of pilgrims from over-sea is more than 5,000 less than last year. The item ' Javanese ' is this year split up into two cate gories, Malayan' and 'Dutch East Indies,' though it would not be safe to assume that all the former are British-protected persons, or all the latter Dutch.Table (B).

This may not be quite accurate, but it enables a comparison to be made with last year's figures. O Table (C).

The chief items of interest in Table (C) are the following : The number of pilgrims brought in British bottoms was slightly less than before, but the number carried in Italian ships increased a good deal; the number of voyages by Italian ships also increased, though the average number of pilgrims carried per voyage was only about 100, much less than the corresponding British figure. (3) Quarantine. 36. For the pilgrims travelling overland from Iraq, quarantine arrange ments were similar to those of last year. The Iraq Government maintained a quarantine post at Rahbah, while the Saudi post was at Hail. Pilgrims returning to Iraq after the pilgrimage were detained for one night at the Iraq post at Rahbah, after which, the pilgrimage having been declared clean, they were allowed to proceed to their destinations in Iraq. The Saudi personnel in charge of preventive and curative measures on this route were Dr. Taufiq Qassaibati and one dispenser. Kamaran. 37. As far as Kamaran was concerned, the pilgrimage season opened with the arrival of the M.S. Kota Baroe from the Netherlands Indies on the 6th September, 1938, and closed with the departure of the steamship Rahmani on the 24th January, 1939. During that period 34,537 pilgrims were dealt with, a slight decrease as compared with last year's figure of 37,543. Twenty-three steamers came from India, thirteen from the Netherlands Indies, five from the Straits Settlements, and seven from the Arabian and African coasts. More pilgrims than last year came from the Netherlands Indies, but fewer from the Straits Settlements, British India and Arabia and Africa. The health of the pilgrims was very good once more. Only four cases of infection of infectious disease were reported : one case of modified small-pox on a ship from India, and three cases of measles, also on an Indian ship. One of the three cases had proved fatal before arrival at Kamaran, and a second death occurred on the way to Jedda. None of these cases were landed at Kamaran for treatment; adequate precautions for isolation were taken on board. In view of this healthy record all steamers were dealt with according to the measures prescribed for healthy ' ships in article 20 of the Anglo-Dutch Agreement of 1926. All the steamers calling at Kamaran were exempted from landing pilgrims. The inspecting staff at Kamaran noticed the interesting fact that more camp beds were in use than ever before; a practice which is to be encouraged, though it takes up more space than sleeping on the deck. None of the ships were reported to be full except the El Hind. All pilgrims reached Kamaran duly protected against cholera and small-pox. The Italian troopship Sannio again brought pilgrims from Mogadiscio, to the number of 398, a considerable reduction on last year's fio-ure. A great improvement was noticed in regard to baggage, as much more than in previous years was stored below. 38. The quarantine fee remained at 3 rupees per person. His Maiestv's Minister was able once more to dispense returning ships from calling at Kamaran m the same way as was reported last year. 39. More pilgrims than previously are beginning to land at Kamaran under arrangements made by the Civil Administrator; those who landed matlv appreciated the opportunity of a few hours ashore. Tor. t ? ( l u f r . ant ^ ne controlled by the International Quarantine Board 01 Alexandria was maintained in the same way as last year The board's delegate for the Hejaz this year was Dr. Aly Abdel Wahid Aly The return pilgrimage was declared clean on the 13th February, 1939, the health of the returnmg pilgrims being good; the Tor station closed soon after the 15th March and the Quarantine Board declared the pilgrimage closed on the 31st March. The statistics kept at Tor give the total number of pilgrims proceeding to the Heiaz as 13,479, made up of 7,960 Egyptians, 85 Palestinians and 5,434 pilg-rims of other nationalities. r &amp; •n u 0A ' \ is t00 earl y t0 sa y exactly what the future of the Tor station will be now that the Quarantine Board is disappearing and its functions are being9 taken over by the Egyptian Government; moreover, the views of the Saudi Arabian Government, as put forward by Khalid-al-Hud and Dri Hamouda at the Paris Office of Health in March, 1939, may result in some changes. Suakin. 41. The Sudan Government quarantine station at Suakin was maintained on the same general lines as previously; all pilgrims were vaccinated and inoculated for small pox and cholera before they left for Jedda, and delousing as a precaution against relapsing fever was also carried out where necessary. The health of returning pilgrims was good, the only cases of epidemic disease being fifteen cases of chicken-pox. The pilgrimage having been declared clean, the period of quarantine on return was reduced to twenty-four hours. 42. Great improvements, costing £E. 6,000, have been carried out in the quarantine camp at Suakin. The quarantine jetty has been reconstructed and widened, a lorry and a hand trolley for the transport of baggage have been supplied; the first-class and third-class accommodation has been increased, while the former has been made more popular by the reduction of first-class charges from 50 pt. to 30 pt. The total capacity of the third-class accommodation has been increased to 1,560 persons, so that two boat-loads of pilgrims can be accommodated at the same time. Electric light has been extended in such a way that the work can go on at night; and the water supply and the latrines have been extended and improved. Jedda. 43. At Jedda Dr. Yahya Nasri performed the functions of quarantine medical officer and port health officer, though, owing to preoccupation with his private practice, he left most of the work of visiting ships to his assistant, Dr. Izzat Faraoun. They were assisted by one dispenser and one vaccinator. (4) Health. General. 44. There were no epidemics and the general health of the pilgrims was quite satisfactory. The most prevalent diseases were malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea and dysentery. One case of the sub-tertian form of malaria was successfully treated. A few diabetic Indian pilgrims developed gangrene of the extremities and carbuncle. The Afghan Minister, having partaken of fish at Kabigh on his way from Medina to Mecca, developed alarming symptoms suggestive of cholera; he was treated successfully and it was finally decided that he has been suffering from fish-poisoning. Heavy rainfall at Arafat was the cause of a good many cases of pneumonia, owing to exposure and chill. 45. A good deal of publicity has been given to the activities of the Saudi First-Aid Society, which is supposed to treat ugent cases of accident or illness among the pilgrims. Its annual report publishes a balance sheet, from which it appears that its income is derived from private subscriptions, from the sale of charity stamps and from the Taif Hospital. On the expenditure side we see that 85,000 Saudi piastres are spent in wages, 80,000 on buildings at Mecca and Muna, 58,000 on motors and motor cycles, but only 12,000 on medicines and surgical instruments. The ambulance was sometimes to be seen dashing about, but whenever it was urgently needed {e.g., on one occasion when a lorry containing a party of Persian pilgrims overturned just outside the Medina gate at Jedda), neither the ambulance nor the doctors could be found. The annual report also reveals that 2,062 Saudis were treated, but only 1,706 foreigners. In fact, the more or less forced contributions from local notables do little more than maintain a couple of doctors and some chauffeurs in affluence. But no doubt much will be heard of this society in the coming Medical Conference next winter. Saudi Medical Services. 46. The organisation of Saudi medical services remained similar to that of previous years, and the following list only draws attention to points of interest peculiar to this year's pilgrimage :— Mecca. —The veterinary surgeon was duly engaged and employed at Mecca. He was an Egyptian, as were the lady doctor and the midwife. All the rest of the staff were Syrians. [20207] c10 Jedda.—Dv. Akram Shooman was assisted by Dr. Ibrahim Adham, who appears to be coming back into favour; these two Syrian doctors were assisted by a dispenser and a midwife, both Egyptians. a ^ Medina. —'The same as in the previous pilgrimage, save that Dr. .baud-ui- Mahroos does not seem to have been employed. Bahra. —A first-aid post was maintained under one official. Taif, Jauf and Yarribo had the same staff as last year; Wedj had one doctor, and Hail one doctor and one dispenser; and in addition to the itinerating doctoi there was the following staff at places not mentioned last year ; at Rahigh one first-aid official; at Al Massajid the same; at Jizan an Indian doctor and an assistant dispenser; and the same at Abha. There was also Dr. Ramzy, the Turkish army surgeon, and the following Indian staff on the Persian Gulf side : at AlHasa, Dr. Syed Bashir Hussein with one dispenser, and at Qatif, Dr. Abdul Latif also with one dispenser. Local Government Hospitals. 47. Jedda. —The local Government hospital continued to function as last year, Dr. Akram Shooman being the surgeon on the staff. He and the British Legation doctor performed some successful operations. The equipment of the hospital is very poor, and the medical wards were usually empty. A Syrian eye surgeon named Dr. Qusaibati has done some operations on eyes, for very large fees. The foreign dispensaries continue to be much more popular in view of the better and cheaper treatment they give; though one of them, the Eussian, has been closed; the Russian doctor, however, Dr. Stepukhoff, having refused a summons to return to his native country, continues to treat patients on his own account, principally venereal diseases cases. 48. Mecca. —The X-ray plant continues to receive great publicity, though it is doubtful whether its results are trustworthy. Some operations have been successfully performed, and the out-door dispensary was well attended this year. The Saudi medical authorities endeavoured to have orders issued to all mutawwifs that their proteges should be medically attended, in return for high fees, by a Syrian doctor; this rule was, however, relaxed when Indian indignation made itself felt, and Indians were after all allowed to go to their own doctors. Medina and Taif. —No change from last year. 49. A new feature of the pilgrimage this year hassbeen a series of lectures given by the Syrian doctors to pilgrims on the various subjects, such as venereal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, &amp;c., in which they are supposed to be specialists. These lectures all formed part of a publicity campaign by the Society for First-Aid to the Injured and the Sick. Actually the lectures were little more than self-advertisement of the lecturer's profound knowledge, and an excuse to collect money. Collections of this sort were also made at the posts where the Koshan tax is collected, in the Haram itself, and by personal visits to prominent pilgrims. Whenever an accident happened, however, or a destitute person applied for treatment, either the ambulance could not be found, or it had gone out for the day, or the destitute sufferer was sent away. 50. The Indian medical officer's return of cases treated and deaths from infectious diseases in Government hospitals during the year ended the 31st May, 1939, compiled from the weekly reports of the local health authorities, is as follows ;— Diseases. Cases. 1,731 Deaths. Dysentery ... Whooping cough ... Puerperal fever ... Typhoid fever Measles Chicken-pox Leprosy Mumps Influenza ... Consumption Small-pox ... 143 68 47 18 7 5 4 4 3 1 19 Nil 37 10 5 Nil Nil Nil Nil 3 Nil Total 2,031 7511 51. Not much reliance can be placed on these figures. Diagnosis is probably wrong; diseases such as all venereal maladies, which are extremely rife, are not mentioned, and many patients are treated by the three legation dispensaries. Even if there had been a serious epidemic it would certainly have been called something else, or all mention of it suppressed. General Sanitary Conditions. 52. Dr. Ghulum Rasul has not observed any improvement in general sanitary conditions. Flies on meat and vegetables were just as common. The mutawwifs' houses at Jedda and Mecca were grossly overcrowded, the cubic space per head being much less than is allowed in Indian jails. There is no proper latrine or bath arrangements for the pilgrims. The state of Mecca and its surroundings remained the same. Dr. Ghulam Rasul was able to visit Medina this year, and he reports it to be comparatively free from flies and mosquitoes, the main streets being washed with water daily. It must be remembered, however, that fewer pilgrims visit it than was the custom in the past. Government of India Dispensaries. 53. The Jedda dispensary worked as usual throughout the year, except for a fortnight during the rush season when all the staff were employed at Mecca. 54. The Mecca dispensary remained open from the 25th December, 1938, to the 7th March, 1939, the opening being slightly delayed as the temporary doctors' diplomas did not arrive from India at the proper time. The temporary doctor, sub-assistant surgeon Dr. Syed Ali Noor, together with the temporary compounder, Mohammad Hussen, came from the Bihar Subordinate Medical Service. One of the three Jedda dispensers, Bashir Ahmed, was also detailed to help during the busiest two months at Mecca, and Dr. Mirza Ghulam Easul himself, with his two remaining dispensers, were at Mecca for the rush period. The arrangements at Muna were the same as those of last year. Cases Treated in the Indian Dispensaries. 55. The total number of cases treated in the Jedda dispensary during the year ending the 31st May, 1938, was 50,034, as compared with 44,573 the previous year. Of these, 9,392 were Indians and 115 Europeans. At Mecca 11,952 cases were treated, of which 6,746 were Indians. Three hundred and ten cases were treated at Muna. Forty-seven surgical operations were carried out, and 3,616 minor operations. 56. The following table shows the percentage of the various diseases treated during the year in the Indian dispensaries :— Percentage. Ulcers 17-54 Digestive system ... ... ... ... ... 11-40 Malaria ... ... ... ... ... ... 11-32 Eye 10-56 Respiratory system 8-69 Skin diseases ... ... ... ... ... ... 6-29 Rheumatism 5-75 Injuries ... 5-61 Gonorrhoea and its sequelce ... ... ... 1-83 Teeth and gums ... ... ... ... ... 1-75 Urinary system ... ... ... ... ... 1-54 Nose diseases ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-32 Diarrhoea ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-34 Nervous system ... ... ... ... ... 2-07 Other diseases, including dysentery, syphilis, sand fly fever, measles, pneumonia, and deficiency diseases, &amp;c. (less than 1 per cent, in each case) 12 • 99 100-00 57. About 300 visits were made to patients in their houses without charge. [20207] c 212 Other Foreign Medical Assistance. 58. The Egyptian Legation maintained a doctor without a dispensary for about seven months. At Mecca the same arrangements were made as last year. At Medina an Egyptian dispensary was opened for the first time. 59. The Netherlands Legation maintained one doctor at Mecca, with one dispenser. 60. The Italian Legation doctor was here throughout the year, and is a Fascist propagandist, with friendly feelings towards the Syrian doctors, who appear to share his views. 61. The Russian Legation having been withdrawn from Jedda, no official Russian doctor was in practice : but, in fact, the legation doctor, Stepukhoff, refused to be sent back to Russia, and remains at Jedda, where he treats a considerable clientele, mostly of venereal cases. 62. The Afghan Government again engaged a doctor to be in charge of their dispensary at Mecca for one month; he was a British Indian subject. Legation Medical Staff. 63. Dr. Mirza Ghulam Rasul continued in charge, assisted by three dis pensers. Sub-assistant surgeon Dr. Syed Ali Noor, with one dispenser, worked at Mecca during the pilgrimage season. (5) Internal Transport. 64. The only pilgrim who travelled by air was Prince Mohammad Ali, who, after arriving by boat, flew in a specially chartered plane from Jedda to Medina, and thence back to Egypt. The Banque Misr did not run any air service for pilgrims; previous experience had shown that it was expensive and trouble some to arrange. Nor was it popular with pilgrims. The heavy landing charges exacted by the Saudis were sufficient to make pilgrims avoid this method of travel. 65. The chief means of transport was again by motor buses and cars. The Arab Motor Company does not seem to have done quite so well out of its monopoly this year as in 1938, if any reliance can be placed on its returns. It was prophesied in last year's report (paragraph 102) that if the same number of pilgrims were to come this year, and were to travel in the same way, the Government stood to gain £30,000 gold. They did not do so. The income of the company is given as about 8 million piastres miri (equivalent to about £73,000 gold) less than that of last year, in spite of the fact that the total number of pilgrims who travelled by car exceeded last year's figure by 6,181. The explanation is that the real increase in fares for those who went to Mecca first and then to Medina via Jedda resulted in a great decrease of travellers by motor to Medina. The demand was, in fact, very elastic. The alternative method, which received an unexpected boom, was camel transport; and some who could not afford to hire a camel to Medina walked. The number of pilgrims who travelled between Jedda and Medina by car fell by 4,409, as compared with 1938. The number of travellers by motor transport to Arafat also fell by about 1,000. 66. The Ministry of Finance purchased a further lot of 140 shares in the Arab Car Company at £ 105. gold per share. There cannot be very many private shareholders left now. 67. The Car Company purchased twenty-four new cars and ninety-two new lorries for this season for £24,439 gold. They sold twenty-six vehicles for £3,604 gold. In all the company had 605 vehicles in working order during the pilgrimage season, of which 492 v were lorries. These figures are taken from the company's own returns. 68. The following table shows the number of pilgrims who used motor vehicles for transport during some part of their pilgrimage, last year's figures being given for comparison 1938. 1939. From Mecca to Medina and back ... 16,478 From Jedda to Medina and back From Mecca to Jedda (single) ... From Jedda to Mecca (single) ... From Jedda to Mecca and back ... From Yembu to Medina (single) 5,069 18,744 8,700 31,764 52,169 76 24713 From Yembu to Medina and then back 1938. 1939. to Mecca 195 From Medina to Mecca and back to Medina, and from Medina to Mecca only 1,706 From Mecca to Arafat and back ... 5,002 3,951 From Mecca to Taif and back ... ... ... 60 Total 68,990 75,171 69. It will be observed that while the single fares from Mecca to Jedda. and Jedda to Mecca, disappeared, return fares more than took their place; but. on the other hand, the total number going from Mecca to Medina and back and from Jedda to Medina and back in 1938 was higher than in 1939; and passengers from Medina to Mecca and back to Medina, and from Medina to Mecca only, amounted to 1,706 last year, but nil this year. 70. No Sudanese drivers were employed this year, though there was in fact a shortage of chauffeurs in the rush period. Complaints of extortion and incivility from chauffeurs were legion; those made by Indians were dealt with by the Indian vice-consul, and some of the drivers were punished as a result. 71. The doings of the ' Nejd Car Company '' remain as mysterious as before. Its main function is to organise transport for the King and the tribes of Nejd. It runs a service between Riyadh and the Hejaz. As for the interest of the Arab Motor Car Company in this company, the accounts of the former show that a further sum of £6,600 gold was paid to the Nejd company this year. According to the current rumour, the Arab Motor Company pays for the upkeep of the Nejd company, which has no other income; nor, in all probability, does it ever produce any account. 72. The large garage at Mecca, referred to in paragraph 71 of the last report, has been completed. 73. No road construction worthy of the name has been done. The negotia tions with the Egyptian engineers for a properly built road to Mecca have had absolutely no practical result up to the time of writing this report. Overland Routes. 74. The Iraq Motor Company again made adequate arrangements for the transport of pilgrims travelling from Iraq via Najaf to Medina. The latter place was the terminus beyond which the Iraq cars were not allowed to go. From there pilgrims had to travel by cars supplied by the local monopoly, and pilgrims complained that such cars were greatly inferior to those of the Iraq company. 75. The total number of pilgrims travelling overland from Iraq was 1,800 as compared with 1,350 the previous year. Of these, forty-eight were British Indians. The monopoly for the Medina route was granted this year by the Iraq Government to Haj Omer-bin-Othman, Najm Abood-al-Mukhtar and Ahmed-al-Haj Hussein-al-Behbahani. The fares charged were as follows : First Second T hird class. class. class. ID. ID. I.D. 15-750 12-500 8-150 15-250 12-3000 7-950 (A) Bagdad-Najaf, Medina-Najaf- Bagdad (B) Najaf-Medina, Medina-Najaf ... During the conversations which took place at Riyadh in July 1939 the Iraqi Government accepted in principle the Saudi proposal that the dues and fees leviable from pilgrims travelling overland should be collected in advance through a bank in Iraq and remitted to the Saudi Government in a lump sum. Camels and Cabs. 76. The same remarks apply as last year. Dhows. 77. Last year's arrangements continued. The vexed question of the non-collection of dhow fees in India was not again raised; the local authorities arranged matters through the mutawwifs and their subordinates.14 General. 78, There were the usual difficulties about pilgrims who failed to pay their dues; such persons were detained in Jedda, but the Saudi Arabian Government did not venture to keep them away on pilgrimage day. Those who had paid were allowed to go to Mecca on foot if they wished. To Medina it was forbidden to go on foot owing to the long distance; but a judicious tip could get round this regulation. Nearly 200 Indians came on foot via the Yemen and reached Mecca in a state of destitution. Those whom the Saudi frontier guards caught were detained at Jezan till they had paid their dues. I S (6) Customs. 79. The only new feature to report this year in regard to the customs is the dismissal of some of the notoriously corrupt customs officials. They were replaced by rough, uneducated Nejdis, who were not very careful in handling ^ baggage. Moreover, there seems to have been as much venality as ever. Indian pilgrims continue to arrive with ghee, rice and flour of their own. They have to pay heavy customs duty and very high transport charges, unless they leave this food behind at Jedda, in which case when they return they find that some of it has been stolen. It would be an advantage if Indian pilgrims could be advised at the port of embarkation not to bring these food-stuffs with them. There was no change in the customs schedule this year. (7) Religious Policy. 80. On the whole Wahhabi intolerance has shown signs of diminishing. One of the Qazis at Taif is reported to have been expelled from the Hejaz by orders of the King for excess of zeal in smashing gramophones and stopping smoking. As for drinking alcoholic liquors, the laws are still strict, but when an illicit araq still was discovered at Jedda by the vigilant Mehdi Bey, chief of the police, it was found that several very highly-placed persons were customers. 81. The dislike which the Wahhabis always have had for memorial v buildings and monuments still persists. Nawab Ahsan Yar Jung Bahadur endeavoured to persuade the local authorities to let him erect a mosque and a library according to his own design at the birthplace of the Prophet; but he was no more successful than Sir Nizamat Jung last year (paragraph 83 of the 1938 report). 82. As for destitute pilgrims who cannot pay their pilgrimage dues, they fared even worse than last year. They were detained for long periods and made to beg from richer pilgrims in order to get enough to pay the dues. They were all permitted to attend the pilgrimage at the last moment. As time goes on it becomes clear that what the Saudi Government want is rich pilgrims, in order that they should make money out of them. Three indications of this fixed policy have been observed this season. In the first place, the Saudi Arabian Government requested the Government of India officially, through this legation, that no destitute pilgrims should be sent. In the second place, an attempt was made, and is still being pursued, to make the shipping companies collect Saudi pilgrimage dues from each pilgrim before he embarks in the foreign port. But the third 4 * instance was the most remarkable of all: at the International Sanitary Office in Pans the two Saudi delegates, Khalid-al-Hud and Dr. Hammouda, declared quite frankly that the Saudi Arabian Government's desire was to attract more rich pilgrims and prevent the arrival of destitutes; in fact, the main idea of their * attitude about the International Sanitary Convention seems to be that present regulations do not make the pilgrimage expensive enough. 83. The disposal of deceased pilgrims' estates became a question of some importance m connexion with the estate of the late Sahebzadi Begum of Baroda. She was more a resident in Mecca than a pilgrim; and she left explicit directions that her personal estate was to be handed over to this legation as a deposit in order that the bequests in her will could be carried out. The Saudi authorities however, have argued with some emphasis that according to local law and practice the Beit-al-Mal or Treasury is the only competent authority. The matter is under discussion. A(8) Mutawwifs. 84. The mutawwifs and their agents behaved as they always have done in the past. Large numbers of them visited the areas from which pilgrims come and brought along as many persons as possible. Once the pilgrims were in the holy land they had to pay all the .Saudi taxes. This year mutawwifs appear to have been more ruthless than previously in their exactions. However, each mutawwif has to render an account to the Government of the number of pilgrims he controls, and the fees in full have to be paid by the mutawwif to the Government; it is not, therefore, surprising that the mutawwif does his utmost to get his pilgrims to pay. The indigent and destitute ones were imprisoned and detained, and hardly any of them were released until they had raised the money somehow. 85. Two mutawwifs were accused of definite irregularities. One of them, Seyyid Jamil Abu Saud, was refused a visa for India. His fault had been that he swindled a dying pilgrim of some money. He has now offered to pay back the sum in question. The other, named Ali Mahmud, was put on this year's black list by the Government of India at the suggestion of this legation, for refusing to return to a woman pilgrim a sum of money she deposited with him. From the vociferous applications which Ali Mahmud has made to have his case revised it appears that the black list has a salutary effect. 86. The sustained agitation by the Memon pilgrims against the taqrir system, whereby one mutawwif only is detailed to look after that community, has had an effect. As the result of correspondence with the Government of India representations were made by the Indian vice-consul to the Minister of Finance on this subject. The latter assured Seyyed Lai Shah that he had warned the mutawwifs concerned, and that if they abused their privileges he would have them removed. Moreover, the Saudi Government have refrained from pursuing a policy which they favour, i.e., a policy of extending the taqrir system to other parts of India; no doubt mutawwifs would have to pay large sums to the Government for such a monopolistic position. However, in one case the taqrir system was extended : the private secretary to the Finance Minister had been promised rights over the Assam pilgrims. That province was, however, divided into three parts according to the Moslems in it, and only one-third of the province was allotted to the deserving secretary. 87. The mutawwifs and their underlings were not instructed to refuse co-operation in the registration and the rotation systems, which therefore worked excellently, a tribute to the tact and efficiency of the Indian Vice-Gonsul. 88. Although the Saudi Government representatives always protest that they keep a stern eye on the mutawwifs, it does not appear that they really bother about their activities at all, provided they pay their dues to the Government. A good many small grievances were brought to the notice of Government authorities by pilgrims, but in no case was a mutawwif openly punished. But we know already that the Government is not interested in poor pilgrims : it only wants rich ones. 89. The conduct of mutawwifs in the ports of embarkation of pilgrims left much to be desired : they, as usual, acted as touts for shipping companies, invaded camps of hajjis, and misled the ignorant pilgrims in many ways. The interests of the pilgrims would be better served if these parasites could be kept out of pilgrim camps. (9) Pilgrimage Tariff and Cost of Pilgrimage. 90. Although the official statement issued by the Government claimed that pilgrimage fees had not changed in any essential point, it will be seen from the following that the Saudi Government received more, and the average pilgrim had to pay more, than in the previous year: — 91. By a clever manipulation of the tariff rates for journeys to Medina, almost every pilgrim who visited that place had to pay £1| gold more than he would have the previous year. In previous years the fare from Mecca to Medina and back to Jedda or Mecca by bus (the method by which most pilgrims travel nowadays) was £7^ gold. This year this charge was made for the journey from Jedda to Medina and back to Jedda. Indian pilgrims who like to land in this country in Ihrams and go straight to Mecca were affected by this revised charge. To go to Mecca and return to Jedda they had to pay separately, and the net increase for such pilgrims was £1^ gold.wtm \e^ 16 92 In the second place, camel fares were increased : a fact which was in the official tariff. The explanation given was the increased cost of fodder. However, it appears that the extra charge was not allowed to beneht the camel- men, but was taken by the Treasury. The consequence was that the camelmen went on strike, and about 1,000 Indian pilgrims had to wait at Mecca for some time, thereby missing a returning boat. • ^ i 93. In the third place, the additional charges for overstaying the usual period at Medina were increased by j of a piastre per day. 94. Mention should also be made of the tax of nearly 4 annas per animal which was collected from each pilgrim who slaughtered an animal at Muna As nearly 400,000 animals were slaughtered the Saudi Government must have realised a considerable sum from this tax. o * 95 The tax known as kushan constitutes about three-quarters ot the actual fare paid by the pilgrim, though this tax is not mentioned in the official tariff. 96. The fares from Medina to Mecca charged to pilgrims coming overland from Iraq via Najaf were also raised slightly, from £4-13f gold to £4-55 gold. 97 One tax which did not alter was the so-called quarantine fee for almost non-existent quarantine services at Jedda, amounting to £1 • 10 gold per pilgrim. This charge, oppressive and unjustified as it is, is not more extraordinary than the high fees paid for motor transport: these fees are so high that it-is reckoned that one journey from Jedda to Mecca and back m a lorry filled chock-tull ot pilgrims will almost pay for the capital cost of the lorry. ,, -n 98 Then there is the tax called ' Road Development Scheme Tax. Every pilgrim travelling from Jedda to Mecca and back in a motor vehicle had to pay over 2 rupees and for the journey to Medina and back 5 rupees. Pilgrims who travelled by camel had to pay half fees. No accounts have been seen of the large sums which this tax ought to have by now produced, but what is certain is that no appreciable amount of it has ever been spent on road development. Egyptian engineers engaged through the Banque Misr are always supposed to be arriving very soon with the mission of making a proper road from Jedda to Mecca, but they have not arrived yet. (10) Indian Pilgrimage. 99. The first Indian pilgrimage boat, steamship Jehangir, arrived on the 1st October with 139 pilgrims ; a small number because pilgrims hoped that me competitions with the rival line would result in lower fares later on. Con sequently, out of a total number of 19,670 pilgrims embarking at Indian ports, 15 386 of them arrived in the last month, i.e., between the 24th December, 1938, and the 26th January, 1939. Some 13,000 of the latter were British Indians and had to be dealt with according to the normal routine : the staff of the Indian section, however, proved equal to the emergency. In actual fact, fares were not reduced very much. Pilgrims who deferred their arrival till the last month, but on arrival at Karachi found that the rates had not been substantially reduced, usually paid up and came on pilgrimage after all. 100. The following table shows the number of pilgrims from each province of India, from Burma, and from Ceylon, classified according to ports of embarkation ;— British Subjects. Province.

In the chapter on Statistics ' above it will be seen that 19,817 pilgrims sailed from Indian ports; the discrepancy between the latter figure and that given above is explained by the fact that some of those sailing from Indian ports were not Indians. The ' Statistics ' section also gives the number of Indians making the pilgrimage as 17,669; no doubt some of that number came from Egypt or other countries apart from India. The figures in the ' Statistics ' section were compiled from Jedda sources, while those in this section came from lists of pilgrims sent to this legation by the various Indian Port Haj Committees. 102. It will be seen that about 1,000 more Indians made the pilgrimage this year than last. A comparison of the figures for the two years does not give any striking results. This year no pilgrims were registered from the Rajputana States; there was an increase in Burmans and pilgrims from the Central Provinces. Pilgrims from the Punjab and United Provinces increased a little, while those from Bengal and Assam were a little less. 103. The following list shows the number of non-Indian pilgrims who travelled to the Hejaz via Indian ports :•— 1938. In 1939. Bombay. Karachi. Calcutta. Total.

Numbers are generally less than last year. The Afghan figures are discussed later in this report. Chinese from Turkestan were very much less; it is surprising that even seventy managed to get to Indian ports m these troublous times. The number of Saudi subjects increased still further; they are for the most part returning pilgrimage propagandists. Arabs from the Persian brui 105. No exact statistics of the number of Indians who travelled overland exist. It is thought that the number was about the same as last year, 300. 106. The same two steamship lines dealt with the pilgrimage tramc irom India as last year, and no arrangement has been arrived at between the two rival companies about rates. The Scindia Steam Navigation Company (otherwise known as the Haj Line), still a Hindu concern, replaced steamship Englestan by steamship El-Hind. The Mogul Line, managed by Messrs. Turner, Morrison and Co., had seven ships in the pilgrimage traffic, while the rival line had two. 107. The details of the return traffic to India may be seen from the following table, which gives the number of ships in port on various dates, as well as the number of pilgrims awaiting return, together with the number actually shipped back to India :— Dates. No. of ships in port. Pilgrims awaiting em barkation. Pilgrims despatched. Total. Pilgrims remaining. Remarks. Mogul Line. Haj Line. Mogul Line. Haj Line. Mogul Line.

Between the 10th February and the 26th February there was no Scindia Line boat, and that line had therefore to pay compensation to its pilgrims, who were forced to spend more than a fortnight in Jedda watching the rival line taking away their friends. The last Scindia Line boat left on the 24th March, and all pilgrims by that line who wished to return after that date had to do so by the boats of the rival line. 109. The following table gives the number of ships employed, voyages effected, and pilgrims carried by the Mogul and the Scindia Lines :— Lines. Outward from India. Homeward to India. Number of ships. Number of voyages. Number of pilgrims. Number of ships. Number of voyages. Number of pilgrims. Mogul Line ... Haj Line Total 7 2 17 6 15,104 4,566 7 2 12 5 14,173 4,208 9 23 19,670 9 17 18,381 110. In the same way as happened last year (see 1938 report, paragraph 113), the discrepancy between the figure of 19,670 given above and that of 19,817 given in Table (B) of Section (2) above is due to the fact that the19 latter figure includes infants, while the shipping companies' figures, given above, only include persons for whom quarantine dues are payable. The homeward figure includes about 298 destitutes who came overland and by devious routes, but who were returned by steamer at agreed rates sanctioned by the Government of India. Some pilgrims also came from India not during the pilgrimage season, and returned with other pilgrims. Eight hundred and thirty-four return tickets remained in deposit at this legation. The figures given above bring out the fact that the Haj Line brought 358 more pilgrims than it took back; the persons it did not take had to travel by Mogul Line boats at the expense of the Haj Line. 111. The following table shows the ports of embarkation and destination of the India pilgrims mentioned above :— Pilgrims Pilgrims Port. embarked. returning. Bombay 6,327 7,215 Karachi ... ... 11,025 11,166 Calcutta ... ... ... ... 1,780 19,132 18,381 112. The number of pilgrims who purchased single and return tickets in India, or deposited the amount of the return passage, is shown in the following table :—- Port. Deposit. Single. Return. Total. Bombay ... 14 296 6,017 6,327 Karachi 2 34 10,989 11,025 Calcutta ... 31 1,749 1,780 16 361 18,755 19,132 113. The decline in the number of deposit-paid fares (sixteen as compared with 400 last year) is attributable to the cheapness of the return fare. Return of Pilgrims to India: General. 114. The rules of the rotation system were strictly observed this year; the Indian Vice-Consul, helped by the local agents of the shipping companies, was able to ensure that return passages were booked according to the order of arrival of the pilgrims in Jedda. Some pilgrims, knowing this rule, attempted to get round it by sending on their friends to seek passages for them before they arrived themselves. With the co-operation of wakils ' this practice was stopped and the offenders had to wait their turn. It has already been mentioned that Scindia Line passengers had sometimes to wait at Jedda much longer than passengers by the other line; some of them threw away their Scindia ticket and bought a cash return fare by the Mogul boat. 115. The Indian vice-consul has this year attempted to solve the perennial problem of congestion of returning pilgrims at Jedda by persuading the rival companies to open publicity offices in Mecca and Medina with the object of informing pilgrims of the probable date of sailing of any particular boat. Even so, as long as Saudi transport arrangements are so unreliable, it is impossible to ensure that pilgrims always catch the boat they want. The Indian vice-consul hopes to improve publicity arrangements at Medina in future years. 116. The strike of the camelmen for higher fares has been mentioned elsewhere in this report. Pilgrims who had paid their return fare by camel before the haj were stranded and missed their boats. Some of them arrived at Jedda so late that they missed the compensation which is payable to waiting pilgrims during the first six weeks after the haji day. Representations were made to the Saudi Arabian Government, who promised to look into the matter, though in actual fact the maim difficulty seems to have been that, while camel fares were put up, the increase was taken by the Government. Some Indian pilgrims [^02071 d 220 were stranded on the Medina road for several days; when this legation heard of their plight they approached the Saudi Arabian Government, who sent out lorries to bring the sufferers in. Food, Accommodation, &amp;c. 117. Food supplied on ships was, on the whole, better than in previous years. It is understood that the Mogul Line is proposing to remove their present contractor and to do their own catering. 118. Few difficulties were recorded about the baggage of returning pilgrims. The customs authorities were not obstructive. 119. Complaints about lack of space were again heard. A Bill on this matter is said to be in course of preparation for submission to the Legislative Assembly. But the real difficulty is not that the present legal allowance of air is too small, but that the mentality of most pilgrims is such that they insist on having their heavv baggage with them on deck instead of stowing it in the hold. If all such baggage, not wanted on the voyage, were put in the hold, the problem would be solved. 120. The system of appointing an unofficial '' Amir-ul-Haj ' for each pilgrim ship was continued and resulted in f\ series of reports, some of which contained useful matter. 121. The question of the attachment of a photograph to each pilgrim-pass made little progress. As long as Indian pilgrims, alone of all the many nationalities of pilgrims in the world, are not obliged to have their photographs affixed to their passes, fraud and traffic in passes is bound to go on. 122. The Indian Pilgrimage Section issued this year 178 emergency certifi cates to pilgrims who had lost their original documents, and a further 268 emergency certificates to pilgrims who had travelled overland on foot, but possessed no travelling documents. Refunds on Deposit-Paid Passes and Return Tickets. 123. It was noticed this year that refunds on the unexpired half of a return ticket had in certain cases been claimed, and received, by pilgrims who had stayed on in the Hejaz for eighteen months : and that these persons had had merely used the refund to keep themselves going for a few more months, until complete lack of funds finally obliged them to seek repatriation at Govern ment expense, which was granted. Under section 208 C (2) of the Pilgrimage Regulations this legation is empowered to withhold such a cash refund until eighteen months after the pilgrim left India. One object of this provision was doubtless to discourage pilgrims from getting their half-fares back soon after they had done the pilgrimage, on the theory that if a pilgrim stays eighteen months in the country, that long sojourn raises a presumption that he intends to settle down in this country. But in the cases cited above, the men just lived by begging, &amp;c., for eighteen months, then got their refund, and lived on that as long as possible. Registration. 124. Out of 16,898 Indian pilgrims who arrived by sea, only 427 failed to register : these included persons who held single tickets and need not register, and also some Shi's Moslems. The latter kind of pilgrim is now alloted to mutawwifs who deal with Persians, and the Indian vice-consul has succeeded in arranging with those mutawwifs that Indian Shias should next year be registered at the legation and their return tickets deposited. It is clear that the registration system is working well. 125. One hundred and six unclaimed return tickets are at the legation and will be forwarded to India in due course. 126. Twenty-one Indians and fourteen foreign pilgrims reported the loss of their return tickets. Suitable arrangements were made to repatriate them by obtaining embarkation tickets from the shipping companies. Rotation System. 127. As mentioned above, this system worked well this year : the rule '' first come, first away ' for returning pilgrims was rigidly observed.21 Hyderabad State Caravan. 128. Arrangements were the same as last year. The Qafila Salar, Adbul Qadir Muhi-ud-Din made a speech at the King's banquet praising the Saudi management of the affairs of the pilgrimage. Destitutes. 129. The number of destitutes repatriated at the expense of the Government of India this year was only eleven more than last year, the number this year being 188. But as the Government had sanctioned a flat rate of 40 rupees per pilgrim plus food expenses, the net expense of Government was much higher than last year. The total cost was 8,911-8-0 rupees. All these destitutes were rounded up and sent off by steamship Alavi on the 1st May, 1939, in view of the grave European situation then threatening. The Indian vice-consul also despatched on earlier dates a number of more or less destitute pilgrims, with the aid of funds which he was instrumental in collecting from rich pilgrims. 130. The following tables analyse the repatriated persons by provinces of origin and routes of access :— {a) Provinces of origin- Bengal ... Assam ... Punjab ... Sind Baluchistan North-West Frontier Province * United Provinces Hyderabad (Deccan) ... Madras Bombay ..*. (&amp;) Route— (1) Overland— Via Gwadar-Muscat-Mokalla-Yemen Via Gwadar-Hasa-Nejd Via Karachi-Basra-Nej d Via Persia-Nejd Via Palestine-Medina Via Karachi-Aden Via Karachi-Muscat-Mokalla-Yemen Via Mandvi-Muscat-Mokalla-Yemen Via Bombay-Muscat-Mokalla-Yemen (2) By sea— Bombay (steamer) Karachi (steamer) Mokalla (dhow) • Aden (dhow) 74 14 24 24 16 3 10 3 13 7 — 188 37 15 11 1 1 1 28 4 76 174 14 188 131. The general question of destitutes is referred to in paragraph 20 of the introductory section. A further side-light on the question is thrown by the fact that certain pilgrims travelling via Iraq to Saudi Arabia, proceeding by overland route, held pilgrim passes endorsed to the effect that a deposit ot 100 rupees had been made in India to cover eventual repatriation expenses. As they had deposited this sum they were exempted from the payment of the basic deposit of 7 Iraqi dinars which is normally taken from pilgrims from Iraq using this rOUte i32 The chairman of the Karachi Port Haj Committee, Mr. Haji Muhammad Hashim Gazdar, who himself made the pilgrimage this year, wrote an article containing some outspoken criticisms of pilgrimage conditions, and made the courageous suggestion that the problem of destitutes should be solved22 by a regulation under which intending pilgrims should have to deposit the sum of 500 rupees to cover their minimum expenses. 133. The Government of India have this question under careful considera tion. To impose an additional cash deposit in India would involve the amendment of section 210 of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, which would be ditiicult. The Government is therefore considering an alternative suggestion that a rule should be inserted in the Indian Pilgrim Ships' Rules, 1933, empowering the pilerrim pass-issuing authorities to refuse passes to persons who cannot satisty them that they have sufficient means to meet the full pilgrimage expenses Control over country craft sailing across the Persian Gulf from ports m Smd and British Baluchistan is also being considered. Publicity. 134 The usual Manual of Instruction was not extensively distributed this year, and the copies sent to the legation arrived long after the pilgrimage day. Banking Facilities. 135. A sum of 7,570 rupees was deposited for safe keeping at this legation by a few pilgrims. Indian Staff. 136. There was no change to report except the replacement of Mr. Iqbal Din, after five years' service, by Mr. Abdul Rahim Khan, B.A., of the Civil Secretariat of the North-West Frontier Province, who arrived on the 10th December, 1938. All the staff worked efficiently. (11) Afghan Pilgrimage. 137. Less than half the number of pilgrims in 1938 came to the present pilgrimage. The number last year was 3,709 and this year 1,451. The reason given is the fall in Afghan currency. 138. The Afghan Minister attended the pilgrimage and stayed longer than is his wont. His longer stay was not marked by any greater interest in the welfare of Afghan pilgrims. 139. Dr. Abdur Rahman came on pilgrimage as a medical officer for Afghan pilgrims. He visited Medina during his short stay here and then left on return to Kabul. He cannot have done much doctoring, as he brought no medicines and had no dispenser. When the Afghan Minister fell ill in Mecca, he was treated at the Mecca dispensary of the Government of India. 140. The Afghan Charge d'Affaires requested this legation shortly after the pilgrimage to decline to endorse the return tickets of Afghan subjects for a refund of fares under section 208 C (2) of the regulations unless the return tickets were first certified and endorsed by the Afghan Legation. His point appeared to be that he could, therefore, keep track of fraudulent persons, who either passed themselves off as Afghans without possessing regular Afghan passports, or impersonated other people. His request was acceded to, though it was made plain to him that His Majesty's Minister was not legally bound to comply with his request. It appears very probable that some pilgrims who obtain passes at Indian ports as ' Afghans ' are not really Afghans in the strict sense of the Afghan Nationality Law. It is also very likely that there is a traffic in passes, owing to the absence of photographs, so that it is difficult to check whether the holder is the person to whom the pass was originally issued. (12) Malay Pilgrimage. 141. The Malay pilgrimage season started with the sailing of steamship Menelaus from Singapore on the 6th September, 1938, and ended with the departure of the last pilgrim ship on the 26th March, 1939. The reduction in the number of pilgrims this year is shown by the fact that there were only five ships on the outward journey and four on the homeward. All the ships were of the Blue Funnel Line.iliT 23 142. The total number of pilgrims from Malayan ports, inoludmg Japanese, Philippinos and Saudi Arabs, arriving at Jedda was 3,728 Of the ®?'T®'® Malays (excluding infants). According to the register kept here, this g made up as follows —' Straits Settlements— Singapore Penang and Province Wellesley Malacca • Labuan Federated Malay States— Perak Selangor Negri Sembilan Pahang Unfederated Malay States ~ Johore Kedah Perlis Kelantan... Trengganu Brunei Total 2 ' 059 This shows a decrease of about 55 per cent, as compared with last year. 143. The above figures do not include the few Malayans • Indians who came on pilgrimage during the season via Egypt and India , t exact number is unknown. The Saudi returns quoted o-ive the total number of pilgrims from Malayan ports as 3,750, this is very close to the above-quoted figure 3,728; the extra 22 were probably from the Dutch East Indies. Notable Malay Pilgrims. 144. From Kedah— Tunku Eshah. Tunku Ahmad Tajudin. From Johore— Captain Wan Ngah. Inche Esa-bin-Abdullah. i c n i. Inche Mohamad Said-bin-Mohamed Salleh. From Perak— A , , n t vi x? td n Raja Marthiah, widow of the late Sultan Abdul Jahl of Perak. Inche Mohamed Zin. From Negri Sembilan Dato Panglima Sutan and Paduka. Besar Hassan. From Singapore— The ex -Sultan of Trengganu (Tunku Kichi Muda). Assistance to Pilgrims. 145 Two pilgrims were assisted with loans of money on the guarantee ot their relatives in Malaya. Three others were given advances against their . and salaries due from Government departments in Malaya. A few Government servants, who proved by the production of their leave P a P^ rs that they ha^To return at the earliest possible moment were allowed to proceed sooner than thev were entitled to according to the strict rule of rotation. The Dutch Medical Mission at Mecca again looked after the health of pilgrims, though that 38 96 76 3 439 189 119 149 400 164 19 254 97 1824 mission had to give precedence to Javanese, and to natives of Saudi Arabia. A Royal party from Kedah was accorded special facilities on landing by the Saudi authorities, at the instance of the British Legation. Cost of the Pilgrimage. 146. The rates for return first-class and deck passages by the Blue Line, the only line in the traffic, remained the same, namely, f605 • 88 and §215 respectively, including quarantine dues. The fare for third-class ^thed accom- modation, provided this year for the first time, was fixed at IThe rates for ' all-inclusive ' services in the Hejaz, including road-tax, as fixed by the baudi Government (converted from gold pounds at the rate of f 15 • 40 to £1 gold) were as follows :— With Medina Without Medina Visit. Visit. $ $ By camel 299*85 o? By bus ... • • • ■ • • 298 * 00 177 • 34 By car 383 -40 197 15 147. Flats for first-class pilgrims, who wanted better accommodation than that allotted to the ordinary pilgrims, were paid for at rates ranging between £15 gold and £30 gold each. . * -p . . 148. Children under 5 years of age were exempted from payment oi tares . those between 5 and 10 paid at half rates, and the rest at full rates. Deceased Pilgrims. 149. From the arrivals this season there were seventy-two deaths reported, up to the date of departure of the Malay pilgrimage officer : making 3-5 per cent. of the total. , l . , , 150. The effects of deceased pilgrims were dealt with as usual; they were first handed over to the Beit-ul-Mal, whence they were transferred to the relatives; the effects of those deceased persons, who left no relatives, were eventually handed over to the British Legation for disposal. Miscellaneous. 151. The smaller number of pilgrims this year may perhaps be due to the unpopularity of the residence-permit, for which the annual fee of 10 nyals (Saudi) has to be paid. At any rate this, together with the travelling taxes or ' Koshan ' levied on foreigners, caused large numbers of Malays, who had been in the Hejaz for years, to return to Malaya. 152. Passes were issued for each Malay pilgrim, one pass for one pilgrim, except where there was an infant under 1 year of age, when its photo was stuck on its parents' pass, and its name inscribed thereon. 153. A pilgrim from Trengganu ran amok on the 25th January, 1939, and was detained for observation. 154. Instead of a ' second-class ' the Blue Funnel Line this year supplied on certain ships a class called ' third-class berthed '; it was, however, ribt very well patronised. 155. The arrangements made this year for providing first-class pilgrims with Malay food instead of English as hitherto were universally appreciated. 156. The employment of Malay-speaking dressers to help the ships' doctors was also a very welcome innovation. Staff. 157. The same arrangements were made as last year, Haji Abdul Majid and Haji Mohammad Jamil again applying their long experience with great success. (13) Sudanese Pilgrimage. 158. According to Saudi returns (see section (2), Table (A)) 1938, Sudanese pilgrims arrived this year in Pharaonic Mail ships from Suakin, as compared with 2,054 last year. The official figures published by the Sudan Medical Service show that 1,255 pilgrims embarked at Suakin this year, as compared with 1,851 in 1938. Emergency certificates were issued to thirty-six pilgrims, who reported the loss of their Suakin pilgrim passes.25 159. For many years past large numbers of Sudanese pilgrims have arrived in this country with insufficient funds to cover the cost of pilgrimage. After the pilgrimage of 1938 the relatively large number of 212 indigent pilgrims were each advanced the sum of £E. 1 • 500mm. In most cases the money was required to enable them to pay their mutawwifs' dues. As a result of further correspondence between the Sudan Government and this legation (see paragraph 157 of last year's report), a scheme was evolved which required all Sudanese pilgrims to deposit the sum of £E.l '500mm. with the authorities at Suakin as a guarantee against destitution. The deposit could be refunded either at Jedda after the pilgrimage, or by the authorities at Suakin on the pilgrim's return to that port. The scheme was brought into operation this year, and proved highly successful so far as this legation was concerned. During the return season 640 pilgrims were refunded their deposits by this legation. The work of the quarantine camp at Suakin is described under section (3), ' Quarantine.' 160. Shipping arrangements, both before and after the pilgrimage, were satisfactory and no serious complaints were received. The traffic was dealt with entirely by steamship Talodi and steamship Taif. 161. Nine Sudanese pilgrims, including one Arab Sudani, are reported to have died during the pilgrimage. 162. Repatriation of Sudanese :— {a) Applications considered 2 (&amp;) Applicants repatriated Nil {c) Applicants assisted ... ... ... 1 (d) Applications still under reference ... Nil (14) West African Pilgrimage. 163. According to Saudi quarantine returns, 4,217 West Africans arrived for pilgrimage by sea this year, a decrease of 1,829 on last year's total of 6,046. Although the ports of entry are not mentioned, it is safe to assume that the large majority of West African pilgrims entered the port of Jedda from Suakin. The Sudan returns give 4,268 as the number of West Africans leaving Suakin for Jedda; it is unlikely that any of these went to ports other than Jedda, so the Saudi figures appear to be too low. Since the Saudi authorities have instituted controls at the southern ports of Lith and Qunfida the route between Massawa and those ports has lost much of its attraction. Fifty-nine emergency certificates were issued to pilgrims who satisfactorily proved the loss of their Suakin Pilgrim Passes. 164. Ninety-one West Africans travelled under the auspices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Scheme this year, as compared with ninety last year. By the end of May eighty-seven of them had collected their return tickets and the balance of their deposits, and most of these had left the country by the 15th June. 165. Eepatriation of West Africans :— {a) Applications considered ... ... ... 3 (5) Applicants repatriated Nil \c) Applicants assisted ... ... ... 1 {d) Applications still under reference ... Nil (15) Somali Pilgrimage. 166. According to Saudi quarantine returns, 289 Somalis arrived for pilgrimage by sea this year, as compared with 771 last year. There were also forty-two Zanzibaris and 'East Africans' (see section (18)). Probably not more than 60 per cent, of the total were British-protected persons. No figures are available regarding those who came overland. 167. No advances were made to Somali pilgrims during the return season. 168. No Somali pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (16) South A frican Pilgrimage. 169. Saudi official quarantine returns show that 130 South African pilgrims disembarked at Jedda this year, an increase of fifty-four on last year's total of seventy-six. They were, as usual, mostly of Indian extraction and people of some means. [20207] eW— K-. \\ % 26 170. Two South African subjects applied for repatriation this year on the grounds of destitution. Their application has been referred to the authorities in the Union of South Africa. (17) Palestinian and Transjordan Pilgrimage. 171. According to the figures published by the Government of Palestine Department of Health, only sixty-four Palestinian and Trans Jordanian nationals were registered this year as intending pilgrims, as compared with 725 last year. The Saudi returns (see section (2)) show the number of Palestinians and Transjordanians who entered this country through the ports of Yanbu and Jedda as ninety-three. Palestinians and Transjordanians do not appear in the Saudi returns relating to pilgrims who travelled overland, and it is doubtful whether any pilgrims used that tortuous route this year. 172. Applications for refunds of deposits were relatively few, and during the return season eleven pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £44 ICte. 173. No complaints were received this year regarding shipping facilities. 174. According to the quarantine authorities, no Palestinian or Trans- jordanian pilgrims were reported to have died on pilgrimage this year. 175. No applications for repatriation were received by the legation this year. (18) Zanzibari and East African Pilgrimages. 176. Saudi official quarantine returns show that only forty-two Zanzibari and East African pilgrims entered the country via the port of Jedda this year, as compared with 247 last year. 177. No Zanzibari or East African pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (19) Muscati, Bahreini and Koweiti Pilgrimage. 178. According to Saudi quarantine returns, 226 Muscati and Persian Gulf pilgrims arrived for pilgrimage by sea this year, but the ports at which they disembarked are not mentioned. No figures are published this year regarding Koweiti pilgrims who travelled overland. 179. No Muscati, Bahreini or Koweiti pilgrim applied for repatriation this year. (20) Sarawak Pilgrimage. 180. Only fifteen Sarawakis made the pilgrimage this year, as compared with 111 last year. 181. One Sarawak! pilgrim is reported to have died at Mecca during the pilgrimage. (21) Pilgrimages of Inhabitants of the Colony and Protectorate of Aden. 182. Saudi quarantine returns show that 553 ' Hadhramis ' arrived for pilgrimage by sea this year. No reference is made to pilgrims who travelled overland from the southern ports of Lith and Qundida, or of those who used the overland route from the Yemen. The latter routes appeared to be less frequented this year than in previous years. 183. During the return season the comparatively small number of 129 emergency certificates were issued to natives of the colony and protectorate, as * compared with 203 last year. 184. Several complaints were received from Hadhramis regarding trans port and road conditions between Jedda and Medina. Accidents on that road were more numerous this year, and were mostly due to negligent driving and excessive speed. A bus full of pilgrims returning from Medina overturned, injuring a number of its passengers, only half a mile from Jedda. Consequently', the authorities have issued a warning that severe action will be taken against the driver of a vehicle which is involved in an accident through negligent driving. 185. Prominent among pilgrims from the Aden Colony and Protectorate were Sultans Hussem-bm-Ahmed and Jibil Muhammed, who arrived at Jedda27 in the steamship Rizwani on the 25th January, accompanied by ten followers. They were in possession of letters of recommendation from the Aughali Sultan and from Colonel Lake. During the pilgrimage they ran short of funds, and after reference to the authorities at Aden were advanced the sum of £40. 186. Few serious complaints were received regarding shipping arrange ments during the return season. 187. Two natives of the colony and protectorate are reported to have died during the pilgrimage. 188. Repatriation of natives of the Aden Colony and Protectorate :— {a) Applications deserving of consideration ... 30 {h) Applicants repatriated Nil {c) Applicants assisted... ... ... 26 (22) Italian Pilgrimages. 189 The Italian Government made all arrangements, as in the previous pilgrimage. All the pilgrims had to do was to pay a fixed sum in advance, and the Government released the necessary exchange. 190. The Italian arrangements were similar to those of last year, instead of 616 pilgrims in 1938, steamship Sannio only brought 398 pilgrims from Mogadiscio. From Massawa the number appears to have been about 530, making 928 pilgrims altogether. In the Saudi returns of persons landing for the pilgrimage these pilgrims appear to be entered under the three categories of Somalis (289), Abyssinians (469), and Senegalis (159), totalling 917, which agrees fairly well, except that ' Somalis ' ought to include some British Somalis. 191. As for pilgrims from Tripoli, steamship Sicilia sailed from Tripoli on the 11th January with 470 pilgrims from Tripoli and Misurata, and was due to pick up 200 more at Benghazi. This makes the total number of Italian pilgrims about 1,600, as follows :— Italian Somaliland (Mogadiscio) ... ... 398 Massawa ... ... ... ... ... 530 Tripoli and Misurata ... ... ... 470 Benghazi ... ... ... ... ... 200 1,598 (23) Spanish Pilgrimage. 192. Steamship Marques de Comillas left Ceuta early in January bringing about 1,200 Moors, including many important notables from Tetuan and the Spanish Zone of Morocco. She left Jedda on return on the 19th February. The pilgrims were in charge of a person who called himself honorary Spanish consul,' though the Saudi authorities knew nothing of such a rank. (24) French Pilgrimage from Algeria, &amp;c. 193. No precise statistics or details are available concerning these pilgrims. From the Saudi returns it appears that 3,704 pilgrims arrived from North Africa in the steamship Sinaia; deducting 1,200 for the Spanish pilgrims from Ceuta, we gather that 2,504 other pilgrims came from North Africa, most of them no doubt from French Morocco, Algeria and Tunis. (25) French Somali Pilgrimage. 194. Fifty pilgrims left Jibuti on the 15th January by the Besse Line steamer El Hak. They included Arabs, Somalis and Dankalis. They were under the supervision of Hoomud Benoita, a Dankali, uncle of the Sultan of Tajura, of Gadi Amare, a Somali Aqil, of Muhammad Daleita, a Dankali notable, and of Sheikh Haj Mohammad Shami, a local Yemeni. It is understood that the pilgrimage was subsidised to the extent of 50,000 fr. This was considered a successful pilgrimage, all the more remarkable because of local economic distress.Telegram Inter 'From To Senior aval Officer, Persian Gulf Political Resident, at Shiraz.

Consequently temporary accommodation for hundreds of them would be required at disembarkation point. This puts Ras Taaura out of the question. If they land and wait at Bahrain or Kuwait I foresee innumerable complications with Saudis with delays involving serious inroads on food stocks. Furthermore we should require funds for temporary camp including considerable quarantine and control staff. We could however probably arrange immediate launch and dhow transhipment from Bahrain anchorage to Oqair and Jubail provided Saudis had reasonable arrangements for food accommodation and onward . if - ' I transport. But latter is crux of situation vide correspondence regarding diversion of Jedda food ships, we could anticipate breakdown of motor transport which in any case would be most expensive while camels for large numbers are out of question owing to time taken and fodder shortage in Eastern Arabia. tReturn journey would involve even greater complications. 3 # Moslems have been led to believe that Haj would — /be1 i-Lf- -2- be safe by normal routes and diversion to difficult and expensive journey might have serious effect on our prestige# If nevertheless pilgrim ships cannot use Red i&gt;ea possibility of transhipment from Aden by dhow (offering little temptation to Italians) might be considered* Wtightman,1 61/IS Telegram S» From Political Resident at Shiraz.

Kuwait- Riyadh -- Mecca route. I am directed to refer to your express letter No.141/38/8, dated the 8th July 1936, and enclosure to your endorsement No. 2014/38/8-II, dated the lat October 1936, and to state that the Government of India propose to issue a detailed preas communique for the guidance of pilgrims from India who desire to proceed to the Hejaz by the overland routes during the ensuing pilgrim season They would be grateful for up to date information about the safety bf the Kuwait - Riyadh - Mecca route, the cost of i)heceeding by it and the medical and other formalities to be gone through by chooslr it. It will be convenient if the information can be given on the lines of that furnished by His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, in 1936 in respect of the Nejaf - Medina - Mecca route and in this connec tion I enclose for information an extract from his memorandum on the subject. (Jedda Memorandum on overland pilgrimage routes to Mecca) The following routes will be considered from the s^nd«pointi of (l) security (ii) probable cost and (iii) health, or any other formalities:~ A. Nejaf-Medina-Mecca. Ne.laf-Medina-Mecca route . (i) Security - Internal security in Saudi Arabia has been genera throughout the Kingdom for some years past, and is as good now as at any time past. The route is difficult in parts in Saudi Arabia, and travel ling is rather arduous. Little is believed to have been done, to improve conditions though the Saudi press announced early in 1936 that repairs were being undertaken between Jumeyma and Medina, and that a .vater reservoir was being made at 'Idha. The Medina-Jedda section is still unsatisfactory. Indian pilgrims during the late pilgrimage were lound in their praises of the Iraqi motor service from Medina to Nejaf, but perhaps this was partly due to the contrast between those vehicles and the less efficient Saudi vehicles in which they were obliged to continue their journey from Medina to Mecca. Certain favoured individuals were premitted by the Saudi authorities at Medina to travel through to Mecca in their private cars, in which they had travelled from Nejaf. Time taken on the journey varied from 5 to 8 days between Nejaf and Medina, and 2 to 7 days between Medina and Mecca. (ii) Probable cost.

The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. , Foreign Office.(1) INTRODUCTORY AND GENERAL. With the entry of Italy into the war the Red Sea 'became unsafe to shipping and it seemed doubtful at one time whether it would 'be possible for any pilgrims to come hy this route at all. The Saudi Arabian Government therefore started making complicated arrangements for the transport of pilgrims across the desert from the Persian Gulf; but in October 1940 His Majesty's Government, undeterred by Mussolini's offer to let British ships pass in safety if the same privilege were granted to Italian ships, announced that they would afford all possible facilities for the performance of the pilgrimage by British Moslem subjects, and the arrangements were cancelled* At the same time the Government of India, in order to encourage Indians to brave the Italian menace, generously undertook that the cost of the journey by ship from India to Jedda should be the same as the year before, the difference caused by the inevitable rise in price being paid by the Government. As a result four pilgrim ships arrived from India bringing 4,891 Indian pilgrims. After the Hajj some one hundred leading Indian pilgrims met at the Mecca Hotel and recorded their gratitude to the British Government; the resolution was moved by Ismail Ghaznavi, hitherto a critical opponent of the Government of India. The thanks of the Saudi Arabian Government were also due to General Wave11 who had successfully chased the Italians out of Egypt before the date of the pilgrimage. This so encouraged the Egyptians that eventually 2,096 arrived at Jedda by sea, Lack of shipping made it impossible for any pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies and Malaya to perform the pilgrimage. There were, however, nearly three thousand from the Sudan and Nigeria so that the total of foreign pilgrims arriving by sea was 9,664. But this, compared with the 32,152 of the year before - itself a serious decline - was a big falling off and a sad blow to the finances of Saudi Arabia. Between five and six thousand pilgrims arrived overland from the Yemen, the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Syria, the Lebanon and Trans-Jordan. There were no pilgrims from Spanish territory nor from French North Africa. As a piece of propaganda the Italians sent five Abyssinians and one Libyan by air from Massawa. But the plane had not received permission to land and was looked on with suspicion by the Saudis. Having performed the Hajj the six Italian-protected pilgrims set off Medina, but the King refused to allow the plane to leave 'and come back for them later so that they were*unceremoniously recalled without ever having set eyes on the City of Light, and left immediately. There were between forty and fifty thousand pilgrims at Arafat, consisting chiefly of Nejdis and Hejazis who were present in greater numbers than usual. / Shortly\ oc Shortly 'before the pilgrimage the Saudi Arabian Government announced a reduction of 25 per cent on all Saudi charges, including quarantine dues; 'but as these still had to be paid in gold, which had risen about 25 per cent in price from the previous year, this generosity was more apparent than real* InV^act, only those Indians who brought gold with them from India - a concession specially made by the Government 'of India - benefited from this reduction. The Saudi Arabian Government ! s project for collecting dues in advance through 'the shipping companies at the port of embarkation is still dormant. The King's speech at- the Pilgrimage Banquet dealt exclusively with Arab.brotherhood and unity, instead of with the unity of Islam, as in the past. Non-Arab pilgrims were disappointed. Per the first time the speech was not translated into Urdu* The following prominent pilgrims attended the pilgrimageAbdullah bin Thani, Amir of Qatar; Abdullah bin Jablr, secretary to the Sheikh of Bahrain; Abdul Aziz el Kas'sab and Khan Bahadur Mogal Baz Khan a member -of the Punjab Public Service commission; Mr. Muzaffar Ahmed, -retired District and Sessions Judge of Bengal. Saad Abdul. Railing Chinese Vice-Oonsu 1, in Gair©, came - ' ^o''help Chinese pilgrims. ^ Neither Afghanistan or Iran sent consular officials to the Hejaz-thls year, but some 200 Afghan subjects are reported to have performed the Hajj passing themselves off aa British Indians- There were n^ Japanese propagandists. Gountless delays in the construction of the »ew Jedda-Mecca road compelled pilgrims to bump through the sand and boulders along the old track as in the past. One enterprising Indian thought to avoid Keshan tax on camels by chartering a donkey, a means of transport apparently seldom used. The Saudi Arabian Government, presumably considering that the difference between the two animals was so slight that it would be a mere legal fiction if the pilgrim avoided the tax, made him pay. (2) STATISTICS ., The following tables have been compiled from information obtained from Saudi sources. The Mogul Line, the Pharaonic Mail Line and the Misr Line were the only shipping companies engaged in pilgrim traffic during this season. Besides Indians and Egyptians, pilgrims from West Africa came in surprising numbers considering that the war in Eritrea and Abyssinia must have interrupted normal traffic through those countries. /TABLE (A)I' Nurnber of Pilgrims arriving TABLE (B) . in the Hejaz by sea. of Embarkation Country of Embnrknt-i ^ , ^India and Far East - 'ndla and Alen Malaya Butch East Indies Africa - llorth Africa Egypt Sudan uakin Eritrea Soma li land East Africa South Africa irranged by Countries 1940 6?'03 61 680? 1564 9319 1779 2167 1217 444 1941 5096 . ♦ i 2#?1 18% 01 Arab countries - Syria Aden Hadhramaut j I acellanecus - By dhow from different places but landed at Lith 716 1085 291 32,152 9664 (l) As in 1940 Suakin seems to ' , ' 1 separate country from the - pilgrims from the Sudan this distinction is immaterial. considered by the Saudis as a ' ?

Government of India Dispensaries . The Jedda dispensary remained open throughout the year to .jhe general public, except during the performance of the pilsrimaffe when all the staff went to Mecca for a fortnight. The Mecca dispensary was opened from December 14th. 1940 to VJanuary 31st. 1941. Dr. Mohamed Yunis assisted by Dispenser Inayat Beg were sent from India to take charge of the Mecca dispensary. Arrangements at Muna were the same as last year. Gases treated in the Indian Dispensaries . During the year ending May 31st. 1941 the total number of cases treated in the Jedda dispensary was 43564; 4820 of these being Indians, 90 Europeans and the rest Arabs and others. 256 cases were treated at Muna.

Whc S ame on Pilg^i^age in great numbers, were exempted om Saudi taxes. Some of them followed the coastal route from Yemen to the Hejaz via Jizan while others came up the 'Incense Soad' across the Heoaz mountains via Taif. The majority of them walked. It is q^o 63 ^ 1 ' 13 ?! ^ a m ao ' le two thousand Arabs from Iraq, Palestine and Syria, Kuwait and Trucial Sheikhdoms used the two ancient overland routes, Bagdad-Nejef-Medina and Kuwait-Riyadh-Mecca. The former route was more popular during the pilgrimage but the Kuwait-Riyadh route has since been considerably developed and the Saudi Arabian overnment hope to attract more pilgrims to use this route next year thereby indirectly helping the Nejdis at the expense of the Hejazis. Other forms of local transport . As compared to previous years a greater number of Indian pilgrims travelled on foot t« Medina. On the whole, the camel owner tared better than the motor transport company as pilgrims preferred to use camels. / (6) RSLIGIOJS POLICY.(6) RELIGIOUS POLICY. ( M-Qiemo ? lgne of greater tolerance towards non-Wahhabl T ^ e onl S exception to this was the action taken against certain members of the Qadlan school of the Ahmedla sect who, cn f 0 '®!!? 8 '? iJ rns X Pretexts, were taken Intr custody and deported, tn* + n ?f oham ed, a Qadianl missionary, was arrested In Mecca ana lorced to leave the country. Tws others were arrested and deported from Jedda. Reports have been received that five Indians employed at Hasa who are Ahmedls were dismissed from their iohs on the Saudi Arabian G-overnment' s instructions. ihe morals of Meccans appear to have deteriorated as the re f U Z^ or poverty and unemployment. Many complaints were made and the Director General of Police, after investigation, came to tne conclusion that all 'bad characters should he forced to marry and that the State should help them with dowry money. The King agreed to^these proposals and over one hundred marriages were arranged in one week by the police. It is doubtful whether these forced marriages will improve matters. The prejudice against music is disappearing and Ihn Saud himself is reported to be a regular listener to the delightful songs of Um Kalsum whe regularly broadcasts from Egypt. However, during the pilgrimage the playing of gramophones is discouraged. (?) MUTAWWIPS. In view of the interruption of traffic in the Red Sea, the baudi Arabian Government did nrt permit mutawwifs or their agents to leave the Hejaz this year, though some of them had stayed on in Moslem countries from the previous year. This reduction in the number of Saudi agents was beneficial to pilgrims whc were not subjected tc malpractices on board the steamers or at the ports of embarkation. Only one serious complaint was made, against Shakir Medni, the agent of mutawwif Omer bin Saleh Bahu, who swindled two Indian pilgrims at Karachi out of a thousand rupees. The pilgrims landed penniless at Jedda. The amount was however recovered by the Indian Vice-Consul from Shakir Medni f s mutawwif in Mecca and the case was reported to the Government of India. Crmplaints of general neglect and maltreatment by mutawwifs and other Saudi officials connected with the pilgrimage were •common as in the past. Several complaints of the previous year which had been taken up by the Legation with the Saudi Arabian Government dragged on till the beginning of this year. Only in very few cases was satisfaction obtained. The Sheikh el Mutawwifin, who is a mutawwif himself, continues to adjudicate between pilgrims and mutawwifs, so that his decisions can scarcely be expected to be impartial. The only cases in which speedy justice was secured for pilgrims were those in which the Indian Vice-Consul was able t® intervene directly. It is suspected that the Sheikh el Mutawwifin laauoo instructions to mutawwifs not to visit the Legation, but he seems to have been disregarded so far for all Saudi officials connected with the pilgrimage continue to co-operate with the Indian Vice-Gonsul. The Taqrir system by which the members of certain sects are automatically in charge of particular mutawwifs, has not been extended but is continues t-o irritate those pilgrims who are subject to it. / ( 8 ) PILGRIMAGE T ARI FF AND COST OPh ^ The drop in the number of 3audi suhjeots is due to the fact that the mutawwifs and their agents were not allowed to visit India this year. Thus only those sailed from India who were there before the entry of Italy in the war. ^Once again the Mogul Line alone brought pilgrims from India. The rival Scindhia Line made no attempt to compete. The following tahle shows the movement of return traffic, the number of ships available on given dates, the number of pilgrims waiting to embark and the number actually embarked:- Dates. |Number off Pilgrims ( ) Pilgrims ( f Pilgrimsj 8 ships injj awaiting j despatched jremainingj | Remarks 5 pert 5 embarkation! 1941 - January ' 27 th. 1 1649 1527 122 Rahmani February 27th. 2 3217 3008 209 lalaml March 21st. 1 507 507 o t • Rahmani April 8th. 1. 17 17 Akbar The Mogul Line employed three of their best ships to take back the pilgrims. S.S. Islami was the most popular.

The total number of pilgrims who returned by ship to India is slightly greater than those who came from India. This is explained by the fact that 166 destitutes who had come by everland routes, as well as a few return-ticket holders of the previous year, were repatriated and their number is included in the above figures. The ports of embarkation of the pilgrims mentioned in the preceding table are given below - Port Pilgrims embarked Pilgrims returninp; Bombay 1435 2721 Karachi 2299 2339 Calcutta 1310 WM 5060 The following table compiled from Port Hajj Committee returns shows the distribution of the purchases of single tickets, return tickets and deposits ; Port Deposit Single Return Total Bombay Karachi Calcutta 2 29 10 2 1406 2287 1308 1435 2299 Jtsip 2 41 li 5001 5044Return of Pilgrims to India * No satisfactory arrangement has yet 'been devised to regulate the return of Indian pilgrims from Medina to Jedda. Most Indians visit Medina after the Hajj and return direct to Jedda without passing through Mecca again as it is cheaper and quicker. The Saudi Arabian regulations, permit each pilgrim to stay in Medina for eight days only, a longer stay 'being conditional on the payment of one gold pound to the motor transport company. The result of this is that pilgrims come to Jedda in large numbers before steamer accommodation can be found for them and they have often to wait in Jedda for prolonged periods. Accommodation and sanitary conditions are much worsck at Jedda than either at Mecca or Medina and the pilgrims, who have spent all their money^ by this time, become restive and bad tempered at the enforced wait at Jedda. In normal years the matter is of no great importance as there is usually adequate shipping accommodation, but this year, with the restrictions on shipping imposed by the war, there was considerable congestion. Pilgrims became discontented, andugly scenes were only averted by tactful intervention of the Indian Vice-Consul. The local agents of the shipping company, arguing force majeure, refused to accept responsibility for the payment of compensation to return ticket holders not accommodated within the period fixed by the Indian Shipping Act. The Legation could not but accept the argument, and accordingly had to expend Rupees 11750 in respect of subsistence allowance paid to pilgrims while awaiting embarkation at Jedda.. When the Indian Vice-Consul next visits Medina he will examine the question thoroughly with the local authorities there. There is little hope, however, of persuading the Saudi organisations to regulate their traffic according to the shipping space available at Jedda. Pood, Accommodation etc . Pood arrangements on the whole were satisfactory and there were not many complaints against the catering on the Mogul Line ships. Bengal pilgrims, however, insist on special Bengali cooks on all pilgrim boats on which they travel, to prepare their special diet. The 3.S. Rahmani and Islami were authorised by the Legation to carry 40 and 36 pilgrims respectively in excess of their normal comple-ment when returning to India. This was done at the urgent re q- U 0 S -5 0 f the pilgrims themselves who would have otherwise suffered still longer delays in Jedda. The Legation issued 61 Emergency Certificates to Pilgrims who &gt; lost their pilgrim passes and 145 to those who came by overland routes to the Hejaz and had no travel documents: Registration Out of a total of 4894 British Indians fes-fe came in Indian pilgrim ships 4743 were registered at this Legation. Only 27 return tickets remained unclaimed at the Legation from, the previous year and these have been forwarded to India as usual. Only 4 Indians reported the loss of their return tickets. The necessary steps were taken to prevent their use by unauthorised persons, and duplicate return tickets were issued. The Hyderabad State Caravan did not come to the. Hajj this year. /■r -st-'t-vf.Destitutes. cj q D v destitute pilgrims were repatriated by the Legation in T ' ! &amp; l:n D nl 0 °?- he . 21st Mar ch 1941 at a cost to the Government India of Rs.9890. A further sum of Rs.982 was distributed as stjdsi stance allowance. The tables given 'below, which have 'been prepared from the records kept at the Legation, show that half of the destitutes repatriated came from Bengal. They seemed to have used the Bomhay- ^kalla-^men route to reach the Hejaz. Only twenty of them admitted that they had applied for repatriation after having drawn the refunds payable on their return tickets, hut in lact there were almost certainly more than this.

The Indian Vice-Consioil lias, accordingly, sunraarised tine most important points that everj pilgrim should know and the Government of India lias 'been addressed on the subject with the hope 'Mbat handbills giving the most essential information on the lines suggested will 'be given to each pilgrim in future when he applies for a pilgrim pass. Banking facilities * None of the pilgrims availed themselves of thjs facility this year and no money was deposited with the Legation for safekeeping. Indian Staff. No change occurred in the staff. Munshi Fazlullah Qazi was the only temporary clerk employed this year. The tahle A in section 2 compiled from Saudi returns, shows that only eight Afghan pilgrims arrived 'by sea to perform the Hajj. In actual fact about 200 Afghans came 'but they travelled as British ladians and the Saudi Arabian Government,had no alternative but to classify them as British subjects for they did not hold Afghan passports. Neither the Afghan Minister nor any representative of his visited the Hejaz this year. Mohamed Ishaq in charge of the Afghan Rubat in Mecca takes an interest in Afghan pilgrims in the absence, of any other representative of Afghanistan. According to Saudi quarantine returns 156 Sudanese pilgrims entered the port of Jedda from Suakin in ships of the Pharaonic Mail Line, as compared with 851 last year. During the return season 145 pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £E.216.000 mms., and 80 pilgrims were advanced the sum of &amp;E.41.500 mms. while waiting for a ship.

By the end of April, 28 of them had collected their return tickets and the 'balance of their deposits. It is estimated that some two thousand West Africans are destitute in Jedda and Mecca, most of whom travelled to this country from Massawa just prior to the entry of Italy into the war. Steps are 'being taken to arrange for the repatriation of those who can satisfactorily prove their national status. (13) SOMALI PILGRIMAGE . According to Saudi quarantine returns only 20 Somali pilgrims are shown as having landed at Jedda, as compared with 230 last year. These 20 were well kept in order by a certain Sheikh Musa, previously a clerk in the service of the Somali Government. No advances were made during the return season, as, though at the time British Somaliland was in Italian occupation, Somalis were 'being supervised in Aden and a ship sailing for that port left Jedda at just the right moment.

Repatriation of Adenese and natives of the Aden Protectorate Applications considered 25 Applicants assisted 15 (19) ITALIAN PILGRIMAGE , The last Pilgrimage report says that the number of Italian pilgrims was small because the Italians were unwilling or unable to let them go. This year there can be no doubt that they were simply unable. Mussolini offered to let British pilgrim ships pass freely up the Red Sea provided that their names, route and date of sailing were communicated in advance to the Italian Government, and Provided that Italian ships were allowed to pass freely hy the British. H.M.G, considered, however, that they were perfectly capable of protecting /theira their pilgrims from attack and it was left to the Italians to do the same for theirs. There were a number of Italian ships idle in Massawa hut none ventured to cross the Red Sea. As stated elsewhere, the only comparatively safe method of travel from Eritrea was consid- ^ ered to he by air, and one Italian plane carrying six pilgrims - arrived unannounced at Jedda from Asmara. I'here were no pilgrims, even by air from Libya for obvious reasons. (20) F RENCH NORTH AFRICA AND 3CMALILAND . There were no pilgrims from French Somalilaiid or from French &gt; North Africa. (21) MALAY PILGRIMAGE . There is little to report this year as no pilgrims came to the Hejaz from Malaya. There were, however, several hundred Malay pilgrims in the country who had remained over from previous years. As the result ©f delays in the transmission of money and of •ther difficulties caused by the war Malay pilgrims in the Hejaz had a very difficult time. In order to help them the Government of Malaya author ized the Legation to repatriate destitutes and to relieve distress generally. It was thought that in these circumstances all Malay pilgrims ^ would wish to leave for their homes as soon as shipping was available for the purpose. In the event, this proved to be incorrect and only 354 pilgrims availed themselves of the opportunity offered during the summer of 1941 by three ships proceeding from Jedda to Singapore. Of this number, 45 were repatriated at Government expense. Remaining pilgrims were informed that as they were staying on in the Hejaz at their own wish they could expect no further financial assistance from the Legation. After the sailing of the last ship for Singapore the Legation was informed by Messrs. A. Holt &amp; Co. that the Company, seeing no prospect of being able to send other ships to Jedda, proposed to terminate its responsibility towards all return ticket holders by refunding the value of the return tickets at onc6^. The Legation agreed, subject to the approval of the Malay Government, and the latter was informed of the ^ proposal by telegram. At the time of writing no reply has been received* No Malay Pilgrimage Officer v/as sent to Jedda this year, Haji * Mohamed Jamil, the Malay pilgrimage clerk, carried on alone and was of great assistance to the Legation. During the summer of 1941 charitable Moslems in Malaya collected the sum of 3.0 .2522 which was sent to the Legation for the purpose of relieving distress among Malays in this country.

The extension of the war during l94l to South-East Europe and Russia was offset^ so far as the pilgrimage was concerned^ 'by the collapse of Italian power in East Africa which made the Red Sea safe for maritime traffic. pilgrims from India, therefore ? in spite of the rapidly growing menace of war in the Far East, travelled to Jedda in surprisingly large numbers It was at first estimated that a maximum of 7,500 persons would require shipping accommodation, but, in the event, no less than 10,712 Indians made the journey and extra shipping had to be made available at short notice« From Egypt 3,6i3 pilgrims came to the Hejaz, encouraged to do so, no doubt, by British successes in Lybia during Novembero The threat of war in the Far East kept Malays and Javan ese at homeo Persian pilgrims were seen again this year in the Hejaz after an interval of many years, the ban on the Persian pilgrimage to Mecca having been lifted after the abdication of Reza Shah pehlvio Disturbed conditions in Persia, however coupled with lack of transport, kept the number lowe They travelled overland by the Nejaf-Medina road in old and inefficient vehicles provided by an Iraqi company and they suffered much hardship en route from their cars constantly breaking down in the desert e Indeed, if it had not been for the action taken by Ibn Saud, who sent all his available motor transport to the rescue, the majority of them would not have reached Mecca in time. As it was, two hundred were too late to perform the Haj* A Persian Vice Consul came from Cairo to keep an eye on his compatriotsc A number of Tragi pilgrims, also, travelled overland in transport furnished by the same company and with the same results. The Saudi and Iraqi Governments are, it is be lieved, still squabbling as to who should pay the expenses of the rescue pa^ty sent by Ibn Saud« The Italian defeat in East Africa cleared the way for thousands of Sudanese and 7 /est Africans of whom over 8,000 visited the Hejaz* The Axis powers were not represented at the pilgrimage this year except for some Moslem ratings from the crews of Italian warships interned in Jedda who were allowed to go to Mecca as an act of grace. There were no pilgrims from French and Spanish poss essions j-n T\T 0 r&gt;+'h A-Pr^ca, but some hundreds came from Syria where the i?'Tee Frenc' o n ^ &lt;=&lt;3 9 in T 1. th the Z made the necessary arran^^v^os. A Syrian piicrrnlm- age officer was sent for a short time to assist Syrian pil grims, He was attached to the British Legation in Jedda. /Arafatn Arafat Day fell on Saturday Dscember 27th. The weather was fine. The congregation numbered about seventy-five thousand of whom about twenty-three thousand had come from overseas. For the first time since his conquest of the Hejaz His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Jbn Saud did not come on pilgrim age. This decision was dictated by the need for economy. His Royal Highness the Amir Feisal ? Viceroy of uhe Hejaz pre sided in his father's stead at all the functions. The following prominent persons from abroad attended the pilgrimage:- M. Hasrat Mohani. Inam Majid, the Indian Trade Commissioner for Egypt. Muhammed Muhammed Si Amin Tirik C.B.S., Nazir Umum or the Hadendowa. . Sultan 1 Abdulla bin 'Uthman A1 Fadhli, Treaty Chief of the Aden protectorate. Shukri Quwatley? the Syrian Nationalist Leader. (2) STATISTICS .

The Saudi Arabian quarantine staff were the same as last year^ No cases of small-pox or other infectious disease were notified*. 4 HEALT H, The Saudi Arabian Public Health Department declared the pilgrimage clean. The Indian Medical Officer neither noticed nor heard of any case of infectious disease at Mecca or Muna during the pilgrimage days. As usual5 most of the Indian pilgrims were old and infirm? Diarrhoea and other troubles of the digestive system were more prevalent than last year. In some cases Diarrhoea was so severe as to cause alarming symptoms. Malaria, pneumonia, bronchitis and other chest troubles and dysentery were common, as usual. A few pilgrims contracted small-pox while waiting for steamers in Jedda« They were admitted to the local hospit al and the Indian Medical Officer detained them, after dis charge from the hospital, until it was certain they were free from infection^ Ail of them were Bengalis and it is evident they had not been properly protected. The Public Health Officers concerned should, it is suggested, be more careful regarding vaccination and vaccination certificates.

Hundreds of old vehicles which had been discarded as unservice able were reconditioned arid brought into use to meet the un expected demand which rose to three times that of the previous year. The Company thus made good profits without incurring- much expenditure. The completion of the Jedda-Mecca road before the pilgrim age season^ simplified the journey from the main pilgrim port to the Holy City. But breakdowns in old and ill equipped vehicles on the Medina track were frequent and at times caused real hard ships to pilgrims. The Company could not be blamed as they, like every one else, had not anticipated so large a pilgrimage and they were unable to import new vehicles* It is the opinion of the Indian Vice-Consul that really serious troubles will arise during the first pilgrimage after the war. Then the Company, will find itself without any vehicles in good repair, while there will ? no doubt P be a bumper pilgrimage season, and a very, great demand for motor transport, . , r ' '..v This year ? also the Company failed to publish any state ment of accounts, and sl-nreholders naturally continue, to gl?ui&amp;le^ 10 ■ ri ^ se f n ' c - e of the Company's stock of motor vehicles r 1 - c.ooencs of any major expenditure has? however, greatly improved the Company's financial condition* ' Each : shar eh-.i cler ■ has already received a dividend at the rate of ten -oer-cent per share ,5 and more is. to fo^lowa ' ' ■ ' ^ % Last year it was reported that the Saudi A r ab?a$ Government ■- had placed an order-for three hundred motor vehicles wnich they expected to receive in time for this year 1 s pilgrimage.

As mentioned above the Jedda-Mecca road was completed in time for this year f s pilgrimage. Some difficulties aro^e with the^Egyptian Government on the question of payment of annual instalments due from the Saudi Arabian Government. The latter complained that the road was uneven- and had been poorly oon- structed, A settlement was eventually reached. In view of the shortage of motor transport, camel owners this year obtained a fair share of the money spent by 'oilrims on transportation. ~ '' /QJL* 1 # and Rout e s.Overland routes. The effoi'ts of the Saudi Arabian Goverment to induce _ greater numbers of pilgrims to use the Kuwait-Riyadh route m •preference to the Nejef-Medina track met with little success. The first convoy that followed the former route was caught in rain and floods. Most of the vehicles stuck in the mud and a few were washed away. Although adequate relief arrangements were made by the King, the news of the mishap discouraged others. The pilgrims who travelled by the Ne jef-Msdina track in the el and broken down cars of an Iraqi company met with many hard ships. Some two hundred vehicles failed in the desert far from Medina. Nearly five hundred pilgrims owe a special debt of gratitude to King Ibn Saud who ordered all^available Govern ment and private cars to be sent to their relief. In spite of these efforts nearly two hundred Persians arrived too late for the Haj. The Saudi Arabian Government blamed the Iraqi Government for this® Yemenis, as usual came, in thousands. Most of them walked but some used donkeys which they later sold at good prices. They were exempted from Saudi taxes as usual. 6 'RELIGIOU S POLICY. The compulsory marriages arranged for bad characters in Mecca last year in the hope of improving the morals of the inhabitants of the Holy City have had little effect, and the King must have been grievously shocked to hear from the police that a p11grim guide had raped his own daughter. Under royal orders the'culprit was shot dead in a public street. Then His Majesty composed a sermon on morality which was read to a ■-a the ring of all influential Hejazis by the Amir Peisal. To the Hejazis the sermon was like water on a duck s back, and uhey reacted similarly to Morality Committees which were subsequently formed in the principal towns of the Hejaz. wahhabi preachers in Riyadh have once again^stiffened their attitude towards music, but they are fighting a losing battle. Shias who come on pilgrimage are enjoying increased toleration. 7 MUTAW¥IFS.. The 8audi Arabian Government advanced money to Mutawwifs this year to enable them to travel to India and canvass for the pilgrimage. It is largely due to the Mutawwifs ? efforts that so^many Indians made the pilgrimage at a time when India was threatened with war and conditions were disturbed all over the orient. The Mutawwifs, after two lean years and with the prospect of other bad years ahead, made the most of their opportunities. In order to ensure that a pilgrim will not fall into the hands of rivals on reaching Jedda, it is common practice for a Mutaw- wif in T-^ia to bind pilgrims to himself by cajoling them to lend him money against a promise of repayment by his agent /whenwhen the pilgrim arrives at Jedda® The Mutawwif only returns to the Hejaz hy the last ship, hut his victims who have gone ahead of him frequently find that the agents in Jedda refuse i^o honour their principals 1 promise. There were innumerable cases of this kind this year and the Indian Vice-Consul was oe- seiged 'by pilgrims wishing to regain their money e The c &amp;se o' Mutawwif Seraj Abdul Majid was particularly heinous as he obtained, loans from no less than eleven Assam pilgrims knowing uhat^sucn pilgrims came under the Taqrir system and th^t' they could m no circumstances select him as their Mutawwif. The Indian Vice-Consul by the exercise of a mixture of tact and firmness was able to obtain satisfaction for all or moso of the pilgrims in question. proper publicity in India advising pilgrims to refrain from giving loans to Mutawwifs would put an end to these malpractices. The Taqrir system continues to operate in spite of its un popularity both with pilgrims and with Mutawwifs who do not enjoy the monopoly. In reply to an enquiry from the Legation the Saudi Arabian Government stated that the provinces of Madras and Assam with their dependencies ? except the district of Sylhet in Assam, are held by a particular Mutawwif or family of^Mutawwifs as a persons! hereditary beneficej this means ohau pilgrims^ coming from those regions have no choice in selecting Mutawwifs. They are automatically grabbed by the holder of the monopoly. Memons as a community also suffer from this abnoxious system, monop'i ov holder is r-ure of his flock of, pilgrims without any ^x— ertions%y himself. He is thus not concerned with* the welfare of pilgrims under his charge. A typical case arose this year when four Behar pilgrims complained against Sayyid Ahmed Sheikh, ' whose son had declined to refund several sums of money that had been advanced to him. Sayyid Ahmed, when confronted by the Indian Vice-Consul, admitted one of the claims but refunded on_.y a portion of iu 0 The other claims he declined to admit. La. f -o these complaints were officially referred to the Saudi Arabian Government, but Sayyid Ahmed Sheikh denied the claims and ask.a for documentary evidence to be produced in proof against ninu Pi]^rims seldom ask for proper receipts in such cases_and one matter ha d to be dropped. An ordinary Mutawwif coulo. hav^ b^.n brought to books by the Black List system, but this system aovS not jorli in the case of monoploy holders as they do no u nee - travel to India. 3 vjjjr ^TViAmi Am C OST og P imEIMAGB.. T ast year the Saudi tariff was in gold 'but payments were accented at a fixed rate of thirty-six riyals to a gold pound. 'Ph-s' Hr-aee -Riyal-£Gold exchange caused difficulties, and pilgrims ^morance was exploited by money changers. At the request ox the Tndian Vice-Consul and the leading Indian pilgrims the Saudi 'Tnistrv of Finance announced their tariff this year for the i n piyals instead of gold pounds. Last year s tariff o into rivals at the rate of thirty-six riyals per -—a roiv - and having once fixed the charges at this high level, +'- Srnli Arab1-11 Government is not likely to be persuaded to lower tt-m wh- -old —turns to normal, Two concessions were, however, ci'tained from the Saudi Arabian Government who were once again induced to agree to a twenty-five percent reduction in_ the charges and who also agreed to accept rupees as equivalent oo ny- a' s in par. .nt -of pi? xrim dues.In the light of the new tariff 9 the Indian Vice-Consul prepared the revised estimate of the total cost likely to be incurred 'by a pilgrim in the Hejaz for a pilgrimage to Mecca including a visit to Medina. After allowing twenty-five per cent reduction the total cost in riyals for 1st, Grade pilgrims came to Rupees 1163, for the 2nd, Grade Rupees 749 and for the 3rd, Grade Rupees 425, The Saudi Arabian Government directed the agents of the Mogul Line to collect boat hire of three rupees per pilgrim in advance when collecting the cost of the steamer tickets# As by this measure the Saudi Arabian Government were requiring a British firm to collect Saudi Arabian taxes in India, the question was taken up by His Majesty 1 s Minister with the Saudi Ministry of Finance who agreed that the jedda agents of the shipping companies should collect the boat hire on board the pilgrim ships in Jedda harbour before the pilgrims land, ' The Government of India, however, to the surprise of the Legation, decided that, as a temporary measure during this pilgrimage season, boat hire should be collected by the shipping companies while issuing tickets as the Saudi Arabian Government wished. As due public ity was given by the Government of India about this collection of dues in advance, no serious complaint of extortion came to the notice of the Indian Section, The last two pilgrim ships, 'Rahmani ,? and 'Alavi' did not call at Kamaran so that the Kamaran Quarantine dues, paid in advance by pilgrims, were refunded in Jedda by the Mogul Line agents upon the instructions of the Government of India, The Indian Vice-Gonsul superintended the repayment of Rupees 3 to each pilgrim travelling on the two ships in question, 9 IN DIA N PILGRIMAGE . The pilgrimage season opened with the arrival of s/s ,! Rahmani ,f on November 25th, , 1941, which brought to Jedda one thousand four hundred and eighty-seven pilgrims* The following table shows the number of British subjects from each province (including Burma and Ceylon) who embarked from Indian ports. These figures are based on the returns oP. the port Haj Committees. Thirteen pilgrims died en route to Jedda, The total number of Indian pilgrims shown in Table A of Chapter 2 differs from the total shown below. The difference is explained by the fact that the former was compiled from Saudi returns which are never very accurate* / BRITISH SUBJECTS.For the third year in succession the Scindhia Line did not participate in the pilgrimage traffic. The Mogul Line employe all their ships except s^s n Islami ,, • The following table gives the number of ships run, voyages effected and pilgrims of all nationalities carried by the Mogul Line 0 ft nn tv/a pd from India, !

Pilgrims 1 nervousness was increased by the propaganda of local Axis agents who put it about that Britain was no longer capable of protecting her merchant ships and suggesting that pil grims would have to wait in Jedda until the end of the war. This led to a mild panic and pilgrims on several occasions formed into large mobs, marched to the Legation and clamouied for immediate repatriation. The Indian Vice—Consul* however handled the situation with his usual tact and resourcefulness. Bv several speeches to the mass of pilgrims and by private talks /withwith their leaders, he succeeded in calming them down and in counteracting the efforts of enemy propaganda. The arrival and departure of s/s 'Rizwani' and s/s 'Akbar' with full loads of pilgrims in the middle of February finally convinced pilgrims that they had nothing to fear* The situation was further eased when the Indian Vice-Consul prevailed upon the Saudi Arabian authorities to allow pilgrims to return to Mecca at cheap rates to await in the Holy City the arrival of further ships. Hajjis always prefer Mecca to Jedda as the conditions of life are much better there. After waiting for fifteen days for ships, pilgrims became entitled to the usual subsistence allowance of one rupee a day and the large sum of over rupees fifty-three thousand was paid out by the Legation in this respect this year* Ag the blame for the delays could not be attributed to the shipping company, this expenditure was charged to the Government of India. Urged by their anxiety to return home at the first opportunity, several pilgrims unscrupulously tried to evade the operation of the rotation system by bribing the Mutawwifs 1 agents to get their passages booked in advance before leaving Mecca# The Indian Vice-Consul detected three such attempts to deceive made by batches of pilgrims. The attempts were punished by detain ing those responsible for some time in Jedda and at the same time the Mutawwifs* agents were made to pay fines ranging from Rupees twenty to Rupees eighty, the proceeds of the fines being spent in assisting poor pilgrims. The Indian Vice-Consul, while in Medina in April, 1942 examined the question of the return of pilgrims from Medina in the hope of synchronising the arrival of pilgrims in Jedda with the shipping space available from time to time. Unfortunately under the present Saudi transport arrangements no help can be expected from the Saudi Arabian Government, The track to Medin is bad and it causes much wear and tear to vehicles* The transport company has either to detain their vehicles indefinite ly at Medina till pilgrims are required to return, or send them back empty to Mecca, and then again despatch them to Medina when it is time for Indian pilgrims to leave for Jedda, with the result that either the company has to suffer financially or pilgrims mst pay more. ^he solution would be to provide ships in time to repatriate pilgrims from Jedda as soon as they collec there, a solution which is practically impossible at present. This year, unfortunately the engine break-down of s/s 'Khosrou' added to the delays experienced in the repatriation arrangements of Indian pilgrims. The distribution of over fifty-three thousand riyais amongst four thousand pilgrims, the majority of whom had to be paid several times, entailed much laborious work on the part of the already over-worked Indian Section. Thousands of payments had to be made every day, and proper receipts obtainefU Fo od, A ccommodati on, etc^ There were very few ccmplai.nts about the catering arrange ment of the Mogul Line# However, the flour used for chapatis /wasof the Mogul Line were informed in time to prevent their use by unauthorised persons. The pilgrims concerned sailed on duplicate tickets issued by the agents on the authority of the Legation* Once again the Hyderabad State Caravan did not come to the Haj, The old Kafila Salai% Sayyid Qadar Mohiyuddin* came to the Hejaz, with a sum of ten thousand rupees that had been entrusted to him by authorities in Hyderabad for distribution amongst the poor in the Hejaz. Destitutes* A total of one hundred and thirty-two destitute Indian pilgrims were repatriated by the Legation in steamships, 'Khosrou', '^izwani', 'Jehangir 11 and ,f Akbar% on January 29th. February 19th. March i8th, and April 9th, , 1942. The repat riation cost the Government of India seven thousand three hun dred and twenty-six rupees, and one hundred and ninety and a half Saudi riyals. The tables given below have been prepared from the records kept at the Legation. It is clear from these tables that, as last year, half of these destitutes hail from Bengal and Assam. Sind comes second. Out of these, twenty-one admitted that they had drawn refunds payable on their return tickets, and spent the money. In the course of interrogations the Indi; Vice-Consul discovered that five of the destitutes had said in their statement that they had come to the Hejaz by the overland route, v/hils in fact they had travelled by sea and had obtained refunds on their return tickets. ia) gr ovinv e s of Origi n.

Very few pilgrims brought bags of food stuffs with them# It is regretted that some pilgrims still continue to advance or lend money to Mutawwifs or their sabees# Banking Facilities # » Seven thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine rupees were deposited by Indian pilgrims with the Legation for safe custody.

Table A in Chapter 2 shows only two Afghan pilgrims as having arrived by sea to perform the Haj. As last year, these figures are absolutely misleading# The number of Afghan pilgrims was not less than two hundred, but they travelled as British Indians on Indian pilgrim passes as the Afghan Government has declined to permit their subjects to undertake the journey to the Hejaz during the war#/13 11 PALESTINE AND TRANSJORDAN PILGRIMAGES . No mention is made of pilgrims from Palestine and Trans- Jordan in the returns published this year 'by the Saudi Quarantine authorities and the figures relating to them are probably in cluded in the total of four thousand five hundred and sixteen under the heading 'Egypt'. (See Statictics; Table 'B'). But according to the Government of Palestine Department of Health nine hundred and twenty-five persons had registered by December 10th. , 1941, as intending pilgrims; an increase of five hundred and forty on the previous year f s total of three hundred and eighty-five. No figures are available regarding those who travelled overland. Shipping facilities were totally inadequate and caused much trouble and anxiety to pilgrims and officials alike, both before and after the pilgrimage. Two small Khedivial Mail Line steam ers which were called upon to transport nearly four thousand souls from Suez to Jedda in addition to some three thousand from the Sudan in the relatively short period of five weeks preceding the pilgrimage5 failed to accomplish the task. Following representations from the Government of Palestine His Majesty's Minister prevailed upon Messrs. Turnerj Morrison &amp; Co. j of Bombay ? to place the s/s 'Rizwani ' which was en route to Suezj at the disposal of some six hundred Palestinian, Transjor- danian and Egyptian pilgrims who would otherwise have missed the pilgrimage. During the return season the position was much more serious. Egyptian pilgrims were, as usual, given priority passages and travelled at considerably reduced rates* This doubl form of discrimination was greatly resented by the large numbers of Palestinians who had to wait in Jedda under the most trying conditions and in reduced circumstances for nearly a month® During the return season three hundred and eighty pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £il,572« 0 o 0. 12 SUDANESE PILGRIMAGE. According to Saudi Quarantine returns, one thousand three hundred and ninety-six Sudanese pilgrims arrived at Jedda from the Sudan, as compared with one hundred and fifty-six in the pre vious year* Shipping facilities were totally inadequate. During the five weeks preceding the pilgrimage the two small Khedivial Mail Line steamers were wholly engaged in transporting pilgrims from Egypt, and it was fortunate that ships of the Mogul Line were available for the transport of pilgrims from the Sudan. During the return season the position became critical, and much distress and suffering was caused to hundreds of indigent Sudanese and Nigerians who had to wait several weeks for a steamer. During the return season eight hundred and ninety-six pilgrim were refunded the total sum of £E. 1,339.500mm.15 TOST AFRICAN PILGRIMAGB. Saudi Quarantine return show that seven thousand and forty- eight 7est African pilgrims of all nationalities arrived for the pilgrimage from the Sudan via Jedda, as compared with one thousand eight hundred and eighteen in the previous year# During the return season a total sum of £S.64 t 640ram was refunded to sixty-four pilgrims who travelled under the aus pices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Control Scheme* 14 SOimLI PILGRIMAGE. According to Saudi Quarantine returns seventy-two Somali and Sritreans arrived at Jedda for the pilgrimage# Of that number at least thirty-nine were Somalis who travelled on paid- up pilgrim passes. During the return season thirty-eight pilgrims were refunded the total sum of two thousand nine hundred and twenty-five rupees. 15 PILGRIMAGE OP INHABITANTS OP THE COLONY AND PROTECTOR- AT E OF ADEN According to Saudi Quarantine returns one hundred and seventy-two Hadhrami and Adenese arrived at Jedda for pilgrim age 9 as compared with forty-one in the previous year# No figur es are available regarding those who travelled overland via Yemen and Asir« Treaty Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate who performed the pilgrimage were Sultan Abd'ulla 'bin Uthman A1 Fadhli, who was accompanied by his son and eight followers; Sheikh Qasin Abdur rahman A1 Maflahi and Sheikh Saleh bin Sayed A1 Alawi.

Political, HWD.i HELGRimaE' COSTS BY CiUfEL. w &gt;o1 (a) Probable cost of 1943 pilgrimage to Mecca and back by camel from Kuwait, for outside pilgrims, say ex India. (b) How many camels were likely to be available this year 1943, 2o I liave made careful enquiries on the subject and my observations' given below: (a) Cost per each foreign pilgrim proceeding to Mecca from Kuwait and back should be in the vicinity of Rs. 1200/-. This includes the feeding of the pilgrim with plain food i.e. dates, flour, rice, coffee and carrying his tentage and light baggage. The pilgrim must provide himself with little luxuries like tea, sugar, dhal, spices etc. (b) It is not possible to say how many camels will be available for the pilgrimage but all reports say that there will be an ample supply (up to 1000). 3. Enlarging on above Under (a) The figure Rs.lEOO/- is undoubtedly high as compared with normal years, but is due to the high?xuling for camels today (they fetch Rs.400/- to Rs.600/- a piece now), also the prohibitive cost of foodstuffs for the journey, and the very high cost of water skins, ropes, leather buckets, camel litters, requisites for the journey. It should be borne in Blind that the business of conveying pilgrims whether local Kuwaitis or foreigners, to Mecca, is not undertaken by any of the big Sharif desert tribes of the interior such as the Mutair, Ajman, Harb etc. They are only sellers of camels to those arranging the pilgrimage. This latter work is done by recognized Nejdis, Agailis, Hashaida and Awazim semi tribesmen, domiciled in Kuwait town. The procedure is that the prospective pilgrim, with family or otherwise, gets into touch with one of the above Pilgrim Contractors, and^after^ coming to an agreement with him, signs a deed whereby the carrier undertakes to convey the party to Mecca and back for a certain fee and supply plain food all along the route. Every year and for a month prior to the pilgrimage^these contractors start purchasing camels for the Haj journey from the tribes, and in kwb general make preparations for the number of pilgrims whom they know or estimate will be going. It is' essential therefore that if pilgrims are likely to come from India in any numbers, this fact should be made known officially as early as possible in the town. Another very important point is the fact that a Kuwaiti allows 40 days in which to reach Mecca, an Indian will certainly need about fS^to 50 days, bein^ unused to the hardship of riding a camel. Several Kuwaiti families, whom 0 I know, have already made their arrangements, and at^this early date have contracted to pay R3.rl000/- per head for the round trip. Another important point is that the prospective Indian pilgrim (and this applies also to Iraqis, Afghans, Persians etc.) must be ready ^ Kuwait as soon after the Id al Fitr following Ramadhan (i.e. 1st. October 4o) as possible, so as to enable him to make all his arrangements in good time, for the latest date on which he can leave Kuwait is probably 15th October (Kuwaitis 20th October). . ^ -n It follows that the later the pilgrim arrives, the more he will have to pay for his journey. The contractor will see to this all right. Under (b) all my information goes to indicate that^any number of camels up to 1000 can be made available this year, provided, and 'Ghis proviso is all important, early notice is given go i:he camel contractors of the number of pilgrims they will have to provide for. Their custom is only to make advance purchases of camels for the persons they know are going. Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary Mo. 15 for the period from 1st August to 15th August 1943. 234.

OW o» xa uxitsac were aaacu unejLpeuii* Palestinians and Transjordanians (ov,^ .30QO) 1000). There were also about 8000 - W* lc The presence of the Axis Artr^r within the 'borders of Egypt during the summer of 1942 made the prospects of the 1942 pilgrim- &gt; age look very black indeed. When, later, the Government of India f announced that there would be no Indian pilgrimage on account of f the danger to shipping in the Indian Ocean, despondency in Saudi Arabia was complete. The best that could be hoped for was some hundreds of overland pilgrims from the North and some thousands of Sudanese and West Africans from Suakin, neither of whom bring any appreciable profit to this country. 2. In the event, however, the worst fears were not fulfilled and the pilgrimage assumed quite respectable proportions, much greater, indeed, than the most optimistic 3audi Arabs could ever have been justified in expecting* This was the direct result of British victories in Egypt and North Africa which enabled Egyptian^ enriched no doubt by the enormous sums of money spent by the British forces in Egypt, to visit the Holy Land in record numbers K- (13,000), W 3. To these Egyptians were added unexpectedly large,..numbers of and Syrians (over and West Af «ic ,ans. r#' 4. Pilgrimage day^the ninth day or,, DnuX Hijja, was Thursday, 17th December, 1942. Climatic conditions were again excellent and the general health of the pilgrims was exceptionally good. The concourse on the famous hill of Arafat was estimated to 'be in the region of 100,000 persons of whom about a quarter had travelled by sea. The balance was made up of Saudi Arabians (especially Nejdis), Iraqis, Yemenis, Hadramis and Adenese who had come by overland routes, 5. The general economic condition of the country was as good as could be expected. His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud did much to alleviate distress by ordering the free distribution of bread to destitutes and sometimes money and clothes/as well, Saudi Arabian officials were less inclined than usual to batten upon pilgrims because of the surprising fact that, for the first time in several years, their salaries had been paid more or less up to date. Merchants, hoping to profiteer from hoarded stocks- of foodstuffs were, happily, frustrated by the King who ordered the opening of Government shops where the principal foodstuffs were sold to. the public at reasonable prices, 6, Many Egyptian and Syrian pilgrims endeavoured to have audiences with the King for the purpose of discussing the war and the attitude which Moslems should take towards the Allies and the Axis, Ibn Saud was able to avoid this and once again made it clear that he would not tolerate the pilgrimage being used for political purposes# He expressed his own views, with his usual force and lucidity, at the great annual banquet given to prominent pilgrims when he made a speech a large part of which was devoted to praise of the British for thejjnceasing care and assistance they always'afford to Moslem pilgrims travelling to Mecca from British territories, and indeed, since the war started, to all^ Moslem pilgrims with whom they have anything to do. This plain speaking was unpalatable to many Egyptians and Syrians who sub sequently were heard to criticize the King for his pro-British attitude.7* It Is worth noting that the so called holy carpeti the ^Kiswa 11 , which is sent annually and ceremonially from Egypt- as a cover for the Ka'aha, contaihed this year an innovation in one of the texts woven into it* The King of Bgypt was therein J' e title of'Mutawwakil 'Ala Allah' (he who relies upon God) which is a title once used by the Abbasid Caliphs# Ibn Saud surprisingly does not appear to have objected. S* The Iraqi and Persian pilgrims, who travelled overland exper ienced much difficulty and hardship arising from insufficient and inefficient motor transport• Their sufferings, however, small compared to those of some Palestinians and Syrians who elected to travel by camel. Many of the camels died by the way and their riders were reduced to desperate straits in the waterless deserts, some even dying as a results It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the Palestine and other governments concerned should take every possible measure to put a stop to this practice. 9. The large numbers of pilgrims from Egypt, Palestine, Syria and the Sudan found considerable difficulties in obtaining return accommodation on the steamers of the Khedivial Mail Line which brought them here. As usual this Egyptian company showed its in competence to carry out satisfactorily such an undertaking as the transport of large numbers of pilgrims. Muddles, desire to save expense, favouritism towards Egyptians, incompetent officers, etc.. make this company one to be avoided as much as possible by British authorities who have the welfare of their Moslem pilgrims at heart. 10, Ho Moslems from Axis controlled countries visited the, ^ejaz this year, and there was a similar absence of Ha j J is from ^ench and Spanish North Africa. No pilgrims came from the Par East. Ho The following prominent persons from abroad attended the pilgrimagei- Mohammad Abdullah Zaqloul Bey, nephew of ths late Zaqhloul Pasha; Admiral Mohammad el Khatibi Bey Hakamdarj Salahuddin Bey Ash Shawarbi; Sayyid Mursi Bey; Ahmsd Bey Kamel; Gait Bsy; t „ J Honourable Shamsuddin of Nairobi. (2) STATISTICS . Th^ following tables have been compiled from information unofficially obtained from the Saudi Quarantine^ authorities. The Mogul Line and the Khedivial Line were the only two shipping cdmpanies engaged in the pilgrimage traffic this year# It will aik^aJ? from the tables that the number of overseas pllgrime was a little higher than that of last year, which was mainly due to the remarkable increase in the number of Egyptian pilgrims ana the arrival of Palestinian and Transjordanian pilgrims also in large numbers. / TABLE (A)(3) QUARANTINB * The quarantine arrangements for pilgrims coming overland and by sea were similar to last year. The Saudi Arabian Government did not maintain a quarantine station at Al-Arid for Iraqi pilgrims coming overland this year. Kamaran &gt; Steamships coming from India were not required to call at Kamaran as no pilgrims came from India by sea. Suakin. The arrangements were on the same lines as before. A Sudani woman succeeded in embarking her child suffering from small-pox, concealed in a basket, during the return journey to Suakin and as a result of it, all the pilgrims carried by that ship had to be detained in quarantine there for fourteen days# which caused delay in clearing Sudanese and Nigerian pilgrims from Jedda. jedda . No cases of small-pox or any other infections diseases were notified. General arrangements were the same as last year f Br f Yehia Nasri^ director of quarantine was promoted to be Director General of Public Health, in November 1942, and the vacancy thus caused was filled by his assistant Dr. iszat Faraon# ( 4 ) health . The Saudi Arabian public Health Department declared the Haj clean and the Indian Medical Officer confirmed this# Malaria, diarrhoea, dysentry, bronchitis and other chest complications were common amongst the pilgrims as usual. Niger ians, Sudanese, Yemenese and some other pilgrims contracted small pox during their stay in Hejaz after the HaJ, although they were supposed to have been vaccinated before leaving their countries. Saudi Medical Service# Dr. Mahmud Hamdi Hamuda, the Director General of Public Health for some years past, has died and Dr. Yehia Nasri has been appointed to succeed him, The new Director General appears to be an energetic man and is reported to be re-organizing the Saudi Medical Services* Local Hoapitals # There is nothing new to report about the Jedda hospital.

Government of India Dispensaries * Jedda. As usual the Jedda dispensary was open to the pub lic throughout the year except during the pilgrimage when all the medical staff went to Mecca for a period of two weeks. During the Haj season Palestinians* Iraqis^ Sudanese, Nigerians, Egyptians and all other classes of pilgrims attended the dispensary in large numbers although there were not many Indian pilgrims this year The daily dispensary attendance remained high throughout the ye ai% » due to shortage of medicines etc. especially quinine in all other local dispensaries and hospitals. The Government of India supplied medicines and other medical necessities as far as possible in spite of the wart Mecca. No sub-assistant surgeon and no extra^dispenser^were sent from India this year as no pilgrims came from India. The dispensary however functioned from November 27th., 1942 to January lOth. » 1943 # Dr. Ghulam Hussain the Indian Medical Officer opening the dispensary returned to Jedda as usual but one of the Jidda dispenser! was kept in Mecca, and was instructed to treat Indians only (Indian pilgrims remaining from previous years, some newly arrived from South Africa and other British Indian subjects there)* It was open to all communities as before from December 13th. , to December 27th. , 1942 during Haj daywhen ^.

This was a necessity and will prove very useful both for the general public and pilgrims. Unlike previous years the Iraqi pilgrims were not accompanied by a doctor* Most of them requiring attention attended the Indiah dispensaries. Dr. Mahmud Hamad Nasir was sent by the Sudan Government to look after Sudanese and Nigerian pilgrims# He treated over 1,300 patients of different diseases and vaccinated about 4 f 000 pilgrims in Jedda before embarkation. He worked in conjunction with the Indian Medical Officer, and showed great zeal and enthusiasm in rendering medical aid to pilgrims he was responsible for# Legation Medical Staffs Two new dispensers, Ohaudhari Mohammad Shafi and Mohammed Yasin Qureshi, arrived in Jedda from India on February 20th« , 1943, and took charge as head dispenser and second dispenser from Sayyid Abbas Ali Shah and Ohaudhari Ahmed Ali respectively on the afternoon of April 12th# » 19413, when Sayyid Abbas Ali Shah proceeded on eight months leave and Ohaudhari Ahmed Ali sailed to India* They had to wait after the arrival of their successors as no suitable ship for India was available till April i2th# /(5) internal@ (5) TKTERNAIi TRANSPORT . The unexpectedly large numbers of pilgrims P r ? v f^® d . ( ? . ^ number of problems for the Saudi Arabian Government and the Arab Motor Transport Company for the reason that in recent ^ has been impossible to obtain new paasenger *-ryi^ vehicl^ Most of the old ones were either unworkable or m very baa re pair. The Government and the Company, however, managed as well as could be expected and only on one or two occasions did the arrangements break down. One of them was when, a few days he- fore pilgrimage day,, the Jedda population started competing with the pilgrims for accommodation in lorries to go ^P ^ Then a seething mass of humanity with bundles of luggage, filled the streets of Jedda and attested ^ force to get on board any passing car or lorry. Another ^ightmblockln the traffic took place between Mecca and Arafat when all the 100,000 Haj^is tried to obtain transport at the same time. The situation was saved by the King who placed lOO of his own vehicles at the dis posal of the Transport Company. Thp outlook for i943 is bad because a much larger pilgrimage is expected and the transport situation is likely to be worse. At a meeting of the shareholders of the Transport Company at the end of the season a dividend of 10^ was declared. Investigat ion of the Company's accounts revealed a large surplus because ex penditure on nlw cars and equipment has, by force of circumstances been very sSaU while income has not diminished in proport- ion. There were many accidents -U the ^edda-Mecca road and the King was forced to threaten with dire penalties any drivers who were found at fault. At this the drivers threatened to stiike but tS were intimidated by the announcement of even severer penalties for the strikers (includmg flogging) to employ all the royal and government drivers (numb-ring many hundreds) in their place. Qnm&lt;= rampls w=re employed for transport, but the drought of vpars has crsatly fieduced their numbers and efficiency. It is thought that all the best camels are sold outside the count ry where there is a good market for them. (6) Tm.TflTQOS POLICY . The Committees of Virtue still function but they have become a narody of their former fanatical selves. This may be attrib utld to the fact that most of the committee men are now local TeiLls without the fanatical religious fervour of the Nejdi Wahhabis who formerly served on these committees. Qnwp tpndencv to prosAitize for the Wahhabi sect has heen noted in the person of the Grand Qadhi of the High Sharia Court at M°cca who is a zealous Wahhabi Alim. He is stated to have had some Sccess, principally ^/^^Sxng for converts to ob tain all sorts of concessions and privileged treatment. On the anniversary of the prophet's birthday a well known Jeddawi arranged to give a large celebration in honour of the- even ^ Hosttand Lefts were arrested and taken to the police station but were let off with a caution. One of them, however, the headmasteriM @ of the Government primary school at jedola # was dismissed from his post. (7) MUTAOTIFS - The absence of Indian pilgrims caused the Indian Mutawwifs much pecuniary loss. This may have a salutary effect in future# There is nothing further to report in this connection* ( 8 ) FILGglMAGB TARIFF . There is little to report under this heading# The tariff was the same as in 1941, and, as in that year the Saudi Arabian Government granted a reduction of 25^ on all charges. 'Poor pilgrims 11 enjoyed the usual remission of Government dues and taxes. (9) IKDIAN PILGRIMAGE . There was no official Indian pilgrimage in 1942. Nevertheless there was in the country a residue of pilgrims from previous years, some of them destitute, and a few Indians did reach the Hejaz travel ling 'by land via Nejaf and Medina or from the Persian Gulf# Some Indians also came from ^Sast Africa and from Egypt. Return ticket holders from previous years returned to India on February 19th. f on board s/s 'Akbar'* They had previously been instructed by the Legation at the request of the Company to come to Jedda for the departure of s/s 'Jehangir' on January 22nd. , but at the last minute the master of this vessel refused to embark them as he claimed his ship was not authorized to carry them# This caused great hardship and much natural indignation among the pilgrims and necessitated the payment of subsistence allowance to them while waiting in Jedda to the total of Riyals 5,839. S/S 'Afcbar', in addition to return ticket holders, embarked 11? destitute Indians, and the remaining destitutes (6 in number) were embarked in the same ship on her next voyage on April 12th.

As there was no Indian pilgrimage this year, the post of the first pilgrim age clerk was not filled, and Mr. Ali Gawhar discharged all the duties of this post* in addition to his own, conscientiously and with his usual efficiency. As the need for filling the post of the first pilgrimage clerk has been felt essential, and sufficient knowledge of pilgrimage work is necessary for the incumbent of this post it has been proposed to the Government of India to promote Mr. Ali Gawhar, and send his successor on three years* deputation from any of the provincial secretariats, preferably Madras. Munshi Fazlullah Qazi was once again employed as a temporary clerk and found very useful. It is fitting on this occasion to record the debt owed to Khan Sahib Sayyid Lai Shah by all Indian pilgrims who visited this country during ills tour of service here. His efficiency /and // (16) There is, however, no solution to this problem at pre sen i. because the Sudan insist upon pilgrims embarking and disembei ^ r at Suakin where the entrance to the port ia so narrow and diff.iLt that only small ships can use the port. The only vessele of ta,.o Size at aresent available for pilgrim traffic are those of the Kh^divial Mail Line. If it were possible to use Port Sudan, fand be11er) ships under British Control could no doubt be found for this purpose and this would solve many problems connected with these pilgrims. Great difficulty and much hardship was occasioned to these pilgrims this year as the result of a case of small-pox which was discovered on board a Khedivial ship on arrival at Suakin. This necessitated an increase in the period of quarantine at Suakin which threw the whole shipping schedule out of gear and thereby caused considerable delay to returning pilgrims. The Quarantine accommodation at Suakin i® clearly handle large numbers of pilgrims and _ t ^ i6 .^ ccentua ^ e ?. culties already referred to in regard to the use of this port by pilgrims. This vear the Sudan Government seconded Doctor Mahmoud Hamid waqir of th 0 Sudan Medical Service, and an assistant, for services SSlSg tte JlWW.'..

After discussion with representatives of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance at present in Cairo have expressed opinion that as ? numbers from Kuwait^Bahrain are not expected to be large and as a sufficient quantity of Saudi Rials is thought to be available in these countries, pilgrims ? should provide themselves with Saudi currency. They should pay pilgrims dues and quanantine fee (166.3 Rials) to Saudi Officials on frontier and pay them transport charges in Hejaz as and when they travel. 3.

J* .R .B .M • Minstat^I ,i Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary No ,21 for period froniy^''^^ 1st-15th November 1943, A / i ('? ' ; 330, The removal of the Persian Government restrictions on the pilgrimage has resulted in an explosion of pent-up religious fervour this year. An estimate places the number of Persian pilgrims now in Kuwait at 8,000. In fact, the t^6n seems full of drab figures in 'European' clothes form ing an unpleasant contrast to the picturesque Arabs. However, if wealth redeems them, the Persians are saved. The majority seem to be well supplied with funds the release of which has forced up the cost of all but the mere necessities whose prices are controlled. iimongst the latter a less secular dispensation would include transport to the Holy Places; instead there has been an unholy alliance between profit and piety. A seat in a lorry for the round trip Kuwait-Mecca- Medina-Kuwait now costs Rs.4,000 (lorries take 20 passengers); an extra Rs.1,000 secures a place in a five seater car. These fares do not include pilgrims food or lodging during halts at the Holy Cities. As might be expected the already inflated price of motor vehicles has soared. Here are some examples (i) Colonel Dickson's 10 year old Ford (erroneously reported as 7 years old in the last summary) first sold for Rs.30,000 and resold for Rs.47,000. (ii) One Dodge car sold for Rs.64,000 Two lorries ' ' Rs.1,50,000 (iii) Offer made for one Packard car (not accepted) Rs.80,000. All these vehicles are, of course, second or third-hand. Two convoys of 500 pilgrims each left for Mecca during the period under review, and others are expected to leave shortly. In view of the condition of some of their costly transport their arrival at their destinations and, even more so, their return here, are matters in which speculation would be vain, and, for unbelievers, improper.M (,&lt;] 3.

Yusuf Behbehani, a merchant of some repute here, agreed to pay itbdul Razzak Shami, a Syrian by birth and motor contractor S c /o of the fare to and from the Holy Places paid by every pilgrim produced by the latter. The respons-ibility for finding transport for the pilgrims in return for their fares was onerous and difficult and, as a result, seems to have been bandied about between the two parties. Abdul Razza]i Shami lost his head and, as the number of- pilgrims increased to unprecedented proportions, be/bought old lorries for prices in the neighbourhood of a lac of rupees each. These were purchased from the proceeds of fares at Rs. 2000/- per pilgrim and from capital advanced by Behbehani, but even though fares 'ere raised to Rs. 4000/- und Rs,5000/- per seat the receipts did not cover the cost of sending thei. to I ecca where however they were despatched. No transport was available for t e original pilgrims who had paid Rs. 2000/- per seat, and they clamoured to Sheikh Abdullah Mubarak, the Security Officer for the return of their money. The Sheikh handled the case with the greatest fairness and ultimately gave Behbehani two days in which to refund Rs. 9,00,000; this he managed to do by means of loans from the Imperial Bank of Iran and from various Kuwaiti merchants. The Rpler of Kuwait obliquely refused to help. him.

Cooperation of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait is therefore sought to any measures proposed to him by Government of Iraq for controlled entry and exit of vehicles into and from his country. It is considered probable that an Iraqi;* official will visit Kuwait for discussions. 6 # i shall be grateful if you will prepare way with His Highness so that he may be receptive of any approaches. 6 # Will Tehran and Baghdad arrange to initiate action by their Governments accordingly.

No. T/470 Dated 7th September 1944. ^ Your telegram No. 13 August 29th. 1944 Pilgrimage# 2. Proposed visit of Iraqi official to Kuwait is welcomed and everything possible will be done to secure co- operation of His Highness to any practical measures that official may propose; but the following facts should not be overlooked (i) That all the Iraqi vehicles which returned to Kuwait after the 1943 pilgrimage were impounded by the Kuwait Government a&amp;t offered back to the Iraq Government at purchase price. The Iraq Government did not take them back. (ii) Full particulars of all impounded vehicles were given to the Iraq Government who could presumably have traced owners through vehicle registration and prosecuted them. As far as is known here this was not done. (iii) Vehicles were sent out of Iraq with connivance, if not active participation, of Iraqi officials. Indeed, export on such a scale would not have been possible without this. (iv) All these facts are well known to the Shaikh of Kuwait. He has not spared himself in war effort and, while he has recently recovered ( unasked ) two British military vehicles whose loss had not even been reported, it will be difficult to persuade him to spend money and go to considerable trouble to carry out Iraqi regulations which the Iraq Government itself does not enforce. (v) Kuwait's vehicle position is considerably worse than Iraq's or for that matter Saudi Arabia's and, ^ although Kuwait*has a quota of shipping space from the U ; S.A and is anxious to import her minimum requirements of vehicles, she has been prevented from doing so by the M.E.S.C (my telegram m.Tkn of Sthi^b*, 7* to M.E.S.C. Cairo, refers). As long as this state of affairs continues there will be a strong Yfv, S vehicles wherever they can be obtained• Activities of Shaikh Fahad As Salim in Cairo are evidence of this. Ambassador, Cairo s telegram No. 3 of September 1st refers.. (vi) While I am continually approaching Shaikh on behalf of Iraqi authorities I find their attitude^ ( which has varied from open hostility and attempts to oust the present ruler ^ to a policy of pin pricks ) singularly unhelpful. A recent instance is the retention by Iraq of cargoes ^ or Ku ^ ai ^ assistance and off-loaded at Basrah instead of Kuwait through _ misdirection of consignors. Although such cases may seem unimport ant. they cause very real resentment in Kuwait and make the Shaikh's cooperation with the Iraq Government correspondingly difficult to secure.

Jackson*s visit to discuss certain matters in which I feel that urgent action is required by Your State, and in which I am being pressed from :iiany sides* The first is piece-goods. The Government of India have recent ly informed me that they will not allow the export of piece-goods at controlled prices to areas where the price is not controlled and they have also said that they will either cease the supply coapletely His Highness Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, K«C»S«I*^ K«C*IoK#| .'iUlftK u£.or they may continue to allow it at greatly enhanced rates. It is clear therefore that a ration ing scheme for the ivhole of the piece goods quota Is urgently re quired which will ensure that ex cessive rates are not charged for I cannot ask India to sell articles at controlled rates so that Gulf merchants may sell them at uri~ controlled prices• The second is the smuggling of gold from India for which Kuwaiti dhows have earned an um&amp;^lable reputation and which has jcaused much annoyance# As you are aware we are entirely dependant un India for many things whereas Kuwait exports nothing to India and itwould not hurt them in any way tc prohibit t^ie visits of Kuwaiti dhows. I feel therefor® that it is only retASonable to ask Your Highness to give whatever help is possibl© in checking this tradfe* It is carried on quit© oponly in Kuwait and it wotild be easy to detect eases• The third Is the export of cars from Iraq, There is every sign that they are going to place further restrictions on the un licensed export of vehicles espec ially at the time of the .pilgrimage# I have been asked by Lord Moyne, the Resident Minister in the Middle East to invite Your Highness cooperation in preventing the irre gular raovements of vehicles ( allMiddle Kaatorn countries are betog similarly approached ) and so if the Iraq Govermant iaalc« an attempt to control their vehicles I £mX that ainco it is also an allied inters t overy aa sis time© should be given ';hem* This is what had to he, said*61/iti &amp; M.O Telegram G.T.C.

Pilgrimage waa reopened after lapse of seven years and certain classes of Persians had enjoyed exceptional prosperity and were anxious to exploit hi^i value of Eiyal in which they had little confidence. This year (quite apart from national ban) severe slump has set in and Haj is no longer novelty. There is no movement in Shiraz or Bushire compared with flood of pilgrims last year and Kuwait reports only 200 arrivals.(probably from small ports) as compared with estimated figure of 8000 for same period of last Hijri Year. 3. Figure of 200 is negligible and I feel certain that there can be no question of repetition of last year«s scenes. I have however asked Shaikh to prevent landings of rif pilgrims as far as possible but doubt efficacy of any measures taken as it is difficult to distinguish them from large numbers of Persians who come and go throughout year. Shaikh may well resent being asked to take this step vftien he hears (which he presumably will) that Iraq are transporting Persian pilgrims. 4.

In view of the difficulties and troubles which the Oovernment experienced during last year's pilgrim season as regards assisting.pilgrims who came by the overland route in cars or on camels, and in view of the fact that the transport position will this year be more difficult than last year, the G-overnment consider it their duty to inform the Oovernment concerned of the new measures taken, with a view to avoiding any difficulties or dangers which the pilgrims who may come by the overlaid route may encounter. The Government therefore request the other Govermnents concerned for their part to take the necessary measures which may help to realize this object:- Firstly:- Persons not in possession of proper passports endorsed by consulates shall on their arrival at the frontier posts be prohibited from crossing the frontiers. The frontier authorities will then be obliged to return such persons by the route by which they came regardless of the dangers to which fchey will be exposed on their return. It would therefore be advisable that warnings should be given, and a strict control exercised in order to prevent such persons from leaving their countries in an unathorised manner. Secondly:- The Saudi Arabian Government cannot afford any assistance to strended cars which may break down on the way owing to a particular defect or shortage of spare parts. The G-overneinnts concerned are therefore requested to effect careful inspection of cars carrying pilgrims from their territories, and not to permit cars to carry pilgrims unless they are in a good condition and carry sufficient spare parts for the journey. Thirdly:- Pilgrim, cars together with their wheels and other parts will be inspected'and registered at the frontier posts on their ent^ into this country. They will also be inspected on return, and in case the cars carry with them tyres, tubes or other parts in excess of those already registered on their entry into this country, such extra tyres, tubes or parts shall not be permitted to leave the country. ; Fouthly:- Gars carrying pilgrims should in no case be allowed to proceed alone, but should travel in caravans of at least 5 cars each accompanied by one car as a reserve. Each caravan should be accompanied by a person appointed by the competent authorities of the country from which the cars departed with the pilgrims. The said person or the chief of the caravan should be in possess ion of a detailed list showing the names of all passengers either adults or infants, and the names of the drivers and their assistants. This list should be endorsed or certified by the proper authority of the place from which the cars proceeded. Any person whose name is not to be found in the list shall then be created in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 above. Fifthly:- In no case should cars be loaded in excess of their capacity either with passengers luggage or effects. Sixthly:- Pilgrim cars shall be inspected at the frontier posts by officials of the Public Security and Customs Departments. Another inspection shall also be made at the posts situated midway between the frontier oosts and Mecca. Pilgrims should, therefore make a statement showing all dutiable articles including printed matter etc which are subject to the Public Security regulations. SKY•NTLY:- These regulations fehall be equally applicable to those who travel by camel.\ ✓ '5 Copy of l_etter No,290-24/7 dated the 16th September, 1944, from the Political A^ent, Kuwait, to His Hishness 'the Ruler of Kuwait.

I wish to thank Your Majesty for your favour and kipdness, and wish Your Majesty all happiness wherever Your Majesty may go. I have also received t-he letter regarding the pilgrims,.and wish to thank Your Majesty for the noble purpose and magnanimity of intention and kindness of Your Majesty to the pilgrims who come to the House of O-od and how great is the care taken of those pilgrims to ensure peace and confort to them. May God grant a good reward on behalf of 'Dhe Islam and the Moslems. My Lord the King, we are very careful in watching the pilgrims and not to allow any Kuwait to act against the rules ordered by Your Majesty. Te shall watch more carefully and prevent any action which would be against the arrangements followed, this is in respect of the Kuwaities. As to the pilgrims who come here from the neighbouring countries, most of them come without passports and without the knowledge of their respective Governments. /e used to avoid any action of preventing them from proceeding on their journey after having come in such a way and the purpose of the journey being to visit the House of G-od, and in fact we used to assist all and every Moslem coming to Kuwait and do our best to facilitate their 'ourney and we used to consider the interest of our both countries, and we believe that Your Majesty is well aware of this fact. As to Your Majesty's instructions that all the persons proceeding via Kuwait should, ^ive an undertaking, it is very difficult to do so, because most of these people have no passports or reliable references, and besides that they are afraid of being punished •by their Governments in c ase those Governments find out that their subjects have travelled in this manner. I therefore found it necessary to draw Your Majesty's attention and to seek your adtiee to the best arrangements to be made for the safety of the pilgrims and to save them all the troubles which may stand in their way. 7e, at any rate will do whatever pleases Your Majesty and will jbLlow your advice. 7e pray God to keep and protect you. ++++ +++++++++++++++ +++. +o kji'b i y Q&gt;O.No.C/7^ -24/7.

It is not clear why His Majesty King Ibn Saud addressed His Highness direct when our Minister at Jedda also sent me an extract in translation from the Umm-al-Qura. However, His Highness received the King*5 letter when I was in Shiraz and had answered it by the time I got back. V 3. His Highness 1 ^eply in translation appears rather ambiguous. It is probably meant to be, for, in effect, Ibn Saud has asked His Highness to take upon himself the denial of the Pilgrimage to Persians and others who come without passports — quite obviously because His Majesty is himself being pressed to do so by the Minister Resident. I gathered in conversation that His Highness has no desire to be put in the position of actively preventing Moslems from obeying God's command to the pilgrimage, just to pull Ibn Saud's chestnuts out of the fire for him; and, between the lines, 'Che meaning of his reply is: T If you have to deny the pilgrimage to those without passports you should use your own frontier guards for the purpose and yourself incur the odium for doing so 1 . fw.

After reading S.59A it is difficult to see Y/hy the Kuwaitis are evading return of the lorries.
