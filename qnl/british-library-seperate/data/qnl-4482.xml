Enclosed with the letter is a typewritten extract of an article originally published in the
                           Iraq Times, dated 31 August 1946 (f 3). The newspaper extract concerns proposals to launch a new shipping company in Iraq, with details of share issue and managing committee. In his letter the Secretary to the Political Resident informs that while His Majesty’s Government has no objection to the formation of a new Iraqi shipping company, it should not be encouraged, given the strong competition it will face.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iraq Times</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><subject><topic>Share dealing</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000f3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000f3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
