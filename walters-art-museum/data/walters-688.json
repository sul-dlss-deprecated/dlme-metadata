The painting is in the style of the artist Mu'in Musawwir (Mu'in the painter), who was active in Isfahan from 1044-1109 AH/AD 1635-1697. The illuminated landscape motifs are found in other paintings associated with this painter, who produced both single-leaf compositions and manuscript illustrations. The handwriting is also comparable to that found on Mu'in's accepted and signed works. The subject of couples embracing was a popular theme of single-leaf compositions in Isfahan of the 11th century AH/AD 17th, repeated by Mu'in's contemporaries and students.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/37186", "Keywords": "Islamic; Persian; Safavid; Illustration; Miniature; Painting; Iran", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Safavid Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Style of Mu'in Musawwir (active 1044-1109 AH/AD 1635-1697)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.690.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.690.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.690.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.690.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.690.a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667", "ExhibIDs": "2289, 709, 3084", "Images": "CPS_W.690.a_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
