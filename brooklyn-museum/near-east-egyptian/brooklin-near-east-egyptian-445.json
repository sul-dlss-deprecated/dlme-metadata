These charms were intended to provide protection from specific dangers. Amulets of birth-gods, for example, were believed to protect women during pregnancy and childbirth and to watch over a newborn in the first years of life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Eighteenth Dynasty, certain amulets began to be placed within mummy bandages to guarantee life after death. The most common included <i>wedjat</i>-eyes, signifying the restoration of wholeness; <i>tyt</i>-amulets, emblems of the goddess Isis, who restored her dead husband Osiris to life; and flowers, traditional symbols of fertility. Beads inscribed with a person&rsquo;s name ensured that the memory of the individual would survive throughout eternity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo-called heart scarabs, known since the Thirteenth Dynasty, are frequently found on New Kingdom mummies.
