This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. 1901. MUSCAT. The connection between the Government of India and the Sultans of See ^ Aitchi- Muscat dates hack to 1798. when the first agreement between Saivid Sultan f,? 11 s . ' , 1 FGtttlGS (who was killed in 1801), and the East India Company was executed at a time Vol. XL, when Napoleon I. was believed to contemplate making Muscat a base for p. 39. attacking India. Since that date material assistance has repeatedly* been given to successive Sultans to enable them to hold their own against the piratical Arab tribes, as well as against their own rebellious subjects ; treaties of friendship and commerce,f and for the suppression of the slave trade,J have also been concluded with them on several occasions. Saiyid Sultan was succeeded by his two sons, Salim and Said, reigning jointly. Saiyid Salim died in 1821. Saiyid Said reigned till his death in 1856, when he left, amongst other issue, four Sons: Majid, Sultan of Zanzibar, Thoweyni, Sultan of Muscat, 1856-18G0. Turki, Sultan of Muscat, §1871-1888.

Since his death the Government of India has. on several occasions, assumed the role of protecting power, and no Sultan lias been able to establish his authority since that date without obtaining the recognition of the British Government. It was by the arbitration of Lord Canning that the dispute between Sultan Said's sons as to the independence of Zanzibar was settled in 1861; and when, on the death of Saiyid Thoweyni of Muscat in 1866, Saiyid Majid of Zanzibar refused to continue to Saiyid Salim and his successor the subsidy awarded by Lord Canning, the Government of India (though they never formally relieved Zanzibar of the liability) undertook, in 1873, to be Enclosure i responsible for the sum (10,000 crowns), subject to the observance by the better |[Sultan of Muscat of his treaty engagements, and of a friendly attitude India, towards Great Britain.

These treaties, as well as our own, all provide for ' most-favoured-nation ' treatment. In 1862, in consequence of Lord Canning's award, it was considered to be necessary that France, having a treaty with Muscat, should consent to recognise the separate independence of Muscat and Zanzibar. The immediate ^ 1 ' 1 7/99. cause which induced Her Majesty's Government to become a party to the Joint Declaration which was signed between Great Britain and France on the 10th March 1862, appears to have been an apprehension of French aggression in Zanzibar.

This declaration, so far as Zanzibar is concerned, was abrogated in 1890; but, so far as Muscat is concerned, remains still in force. The present ruler of Muscat, Saiyid Paisul, was recognised by the Govern ment of India in 1890, and the subsidy was continued to him. He at that time gave most satisfactory assurances that he would be bound by his father's engagements, and be guided by the advice of the British Government, whose approbation he desired to secure. In the following year he executed a new commercial treaty with Great Britain, and gave a formal undertaking ' never ' to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the ' British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman, or any of their ' dependencies.'* The position which Great Britain had thus acquired in Muscat in 1891 was part of a larger policy which had for its object a predominance along the whole of the Arab coast from Aden to Bahrein; and, in pursuance of it, protectorate engagements had been entered into with the coast tribes from Bab-el-Mandeb to Ras Sair, viz., the Subaihi, Akrabi, Eadthli, Aulaki, Wahidi, Dhuyaibi, Irka, Kaieti and Mahri, up to the boundary of Dhofar, which latter had been an integral part of Muscat dominions since 1879. In 1890 the Government of India had proposed to assert a virtual protectorate over Muscat, of which at least five-sixths of the trade was in the hands of British subjects, but the Declaration of 1862 was considered to stand in the way. 1895. —Early in 1895 a rebellion, which promised at first to be successful, broke out in Oman, probably iu the interests of the Sultan of Zanzibar, The Government of India sent a ship of war to protect British subjects, but, in accordance with the lines of policy which had been indicated by Lord Kimberley in his Despatch, No. 25, of the 31st March 1880, an attitude of the strictest neutrality towards the rival parties was adopted ; and, when the revolt finally collapsed, they insisted upon the Sultan levying from the re bellious tribes an indemnity for losses sustained by British traders, and, it was eventually arranged, by others. At the same time, however, a loan of Rs. ( d O,000 was made to the Sultan. For the protection of our interests against similar risks in the future, three alternative courses were subse quently suggested by the local authorities, viz., (1) annexation; (2) a protectorate; and (3) an intimation to the leading Sheikhs that Maskat and Mattrah must not be attacked. The first two courses were held to be barred by the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, the abrogation of which it was not considered opportune to propose to the French Government. The third course Avas approved by Her Majesty's Government. It is probable that the attitude of the Government of India on the occasion of the rebellion in 1895 may have had something to do with a change in the disposition of Saiyid Faisul, to which attention was drawn by Major Hayes Sadler early in 1896; but another influence also was at work, which has since that time caused much trouble. In the year 1881 the French Government had availed themselves of their right to appoint Consuls (secured to them by their Treaty with Muscat of the 17th November 1844) to the extent of appointing a Consular Agent at Muscat; but in 1894 they established a Vice-Consulate, and transferred M. Ottavi from Zanzibar to fill the new post. In 1893 there had arrived in Muscat a certain Arab named Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad, Buwaihi, a native of Semail in Oman, who had been confidential secretary to Sultan Seyyid Ali of Zanzibar and had been deported by Seyyid Ali's successor, Seyyid Hamid, for anti-British intrigue. This man was taken into Saiyid Faisul's service as munshi; and, on the arrival of M. Ottavi, whom he had known in Zanzibar, he was permitted by the Sultan also to enter the service of the French Vice-Consulate. Another sign of the increased interest taken by the French Government in Muscat affairs, was the visit of a French gunboat on the occasion of the rebellion, though it did not actually interfere. • This engagement was regarded as a Secret engagement Salisbury mentioned its purport to M. Cambon (1781/99). until early in 1899, when Lord2 3 1896. —In 1890 on the occasion of the Dhofar rebellion, when it was proposed to send a ship-of-war to assist the Sultan, Her Majesty's n .C. 273/96. Government found it necessary to give to the French Government an assurance ' that the action which it is proposed to take implies no intention ' on the part of Her Majesty's Government of establishing any Protectorate ' over Muscat' (27th March 1896). The elt'ect upon the Sultan of French activity began soon to be felt. At ludia Letter, the commencement of tho troubles in Dhofar, in his anxiety to restore his 123, and authority, he was ready to accept our advice and assistance. Suddenly. however, he changed his mind ; and Major Hayes Sadler reported that the Letter, Sultan's replies to the British C ousli I 's communications were drafted by dated 30th Abdul Aziz, through whom, there was good reason to believe, the correspon- June 189G - dence had been shown to M. Ottavi. At the same time intrigues, in which H.C. 060/96. the Sultan was said to be concerned, were reported to be taking place between M. Ottavi and certain of the Trucial Chiefs of the Pirate Coast. The question 590196. of a British Protectorate was, in consequence, again raised by the India Office in a letter to the Foreign Office of the 1st July, but the reply (dated 9th July) still was to the effect that ' present conditions are very far from favourable to the prospect of ' an ' arrangement with France by which an exclusive British Protectorate should be established over Oman.' Notwithstanding the unfriendly attitude assumed in the early part, of the year by the Sultan, when, in December 1896, he showed signs of a desire to take action against the Dhofar rebels, the Government of India again offered g ecl . et their assistance and advice, Her Majesty's Government having previously Despatch, instructed them to endeavour to maintain influence over, and amicable No. 38, relations with, the Sultan. An offer of further financial assistance was also made to him, provided he would manifest confidence in British goodwill'. k e,) ' 1897. —In the middle of January the Sultan became more favourably Pol.200/97. disposed, and he asked for the assistance of a British ship of war for the reduction of the Dhofar rebellion. This request was complied with, subject 1728/97. to conditions, imposed by the Foreign Office in order to meet French susceptibilities, that she should help only with her guns and not land any force, and that nothing should be done which would imply encroachment on 848/97. the independence of the Sultan ; moreover, a further sum of Rs. 60,000 was subsequently lent by] the Government of India towards extricating Saiyid Faisul from his embarrassments. It may be mentioned that immediately after this arrangement had been made a French gunboat arrived at Muscat, and her services were understood to have been offered to the Sultan and declined by him. Finally the mere presence of H.M.S. 'Cossack ' at Dhofar 398/97. proved sufficient to secure a bloodless victory for the Sultan, who was cordial in his acknowledgments. This temporary (as it proved) change in Saiyid 583/97. Faisul's attitude was probably due to the influence of the Wazir, Seyyid Saeed, whose sympathies were in favour of the British Government. In May 1897 he had (at the instance of the British Consul) induced the Sultan to protest against the French claim to jurisdiction over Suri dhows Hying the French flag. It may be convenient here to state briefly the modus operandi of the Enclosure 2 French authorities in this matter, as described by Captain Cox. The captain of a dhow, whether he be owner or not, presents himself at a French Consulate or to the authorities in a French possession, e.g., Obokh, Jibuti, dated Madagascar, Zanzibar or the Comoro Islands, even in some instances 26th July at Muscat. He applies for a French flag, and is told that he must qualify 19u0 - either by acquiring a house or land in a French possession, or else by producing security in the person either of a French protected resident or of an Arab in possession of a French flag. The latter is the alternative usually adopted. When the flag and titre de navigation have been granted, the dhow enjoys immunity from being overhauled by British cruisers* ; and in the case of anything happening to her, the French authorities claim to protect the captain, if he produces his titre de navigation, whether he is the owner or not. * On the other hand, the Law Officers of the Crown are of opinion that in territorial waters the vessels maybe scnrchrd and proceeded against for slave trading; and that, if the French Gcvenunent fail to stop the abuse of their protection, the vessels may be treated even on the high tees as not entitled to the protection of the French flag. (2488/98.)4 Secret This practice had been a subject of complaint by the Indian Government ' ever s ^ llce when the Erench Government made a promise to discontinue dated tth it ' 1)ut on] y, Jis they subsequently (16th October 1897) explained, so far as their Dec. 1891. Consulate at Aden was concerned. The ground of complaint was, primarily, that it threw grave dilTiculties in the way of carrying out the Act of the Brussels nJJ'n .ii Conference in regard to the Slave Trade. Though discontinued at Aden, AV 47, '' the practice was reported in 1892 to continue at Madagascar (India Letter dated 24th No. 46), at Obokh (Nos. 66 and 98), and (No. 231 of 1892) it was stated that Xov. 1899, its discontinuance would be even more effectual than systematic cruising in Lnc. 4. stopping the slave trade. Pol. 803/97. 1^93. it was proposed that the Sultan of Muscat should be invited to subscribe to Chapter IV. of the Act of the Brussels Conference; but the proposal was not carried out, partly because it was at the time understood that the Act was not to apply to the Persian Gulf, and partlv for fear of em- S- ntch barrassment with the Jbrench. In 1894 the Government of India instructed to India, 1 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to advise the Sultan to inform No. 48,' the French Vice-Consul that the assertion of French protection over Suri dated 19th boats in Oman waters would be a contravention of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. Her Majesty's Government approved these Secret instructions. In September 1896 the question was brought prominentlv Despatch, forward owing to the seizure by II.M.S. 'Sphinx' of two dhows fiyin 'o- Jht 121] i ^ renc ^ colours, which were found to be full of slaves. They were handed \piii 1897 over ^ ie ^ renc h Consul at Muscat for adjudication; and a repre sentation was made to the French Government, who, while stating that Pel. 1815/97. these cases would be dealt with, denied that they had ever had any intention No 117 of of discontinuing the grant of French papers to Suri dhows. The Government 1897. ' India thereupon revived the suggestion that the Sultan should adhere to the Act of the Brussels Conference ; but the Foreign Office preferred a pro- No ^fof P osa ^ Sultan should be advised to institute a distinctive flag for the 18 x) 7 1 0 use of vessels belonging to his subjects. 1898. —On the 1st January 1898 an incident occurred which seemed to show that the Sultan was again assuming an unfriendly attitude. He declined to hoist the British flag as usual on that day, at the instance, it was said, of the French Vice-Consul, in order to show his independence of the Govern ment of India. (The Resident, who was present, had, however, no difficulty in inducing him to apologise, and the flag was hoisted with a salute on the 3rd January.) He agreed Without difficulty to issuing a proclamation with regard to the arms traffic; but he was obstructive in the matter of adjudi cating on the arms seized in the' Baluchistan.'' His attitude in this matter 1747/98. also was attributed to French intrigues. Again a proposal was made to him that he should appoint a British officer to control his customs, with a view to remedy grievances under which British Indian traders were suffering. Nothing, however, was done, nor were any steps taken by him to remedy the grievances. ^y 8 o9 of I n March the Government of India reported on the proposal to induce the Sultan to institute a distinctive flag for his subjects to the effect that, Pol. 460/08. ' so long as facilities for obtaining French flags and papers exist, no ' distinctive flag can successfully be introduced by the Sultan among his ' subjects at Sur.' A strong representation was then made by the India Office to the Foreign Office with a view to Her Majesty's Government taking up the question with the French Government (23rd May 1898). This the Foreign Office eventually (20th December 1898) declined to do, on the ground that Her Majesty's Government had no locics standi, as ' Muscat is not a British Protectorate,' and Her Majesty's Government had ' received No. 48 of no request from the Sultan to do so.' The Government of India were then 1898 - instructed to revert to the proposed prescription of a distinctive flag. Meanwhile, in October, the French gunboat 4&lt; Scorpion ' visited Muscat, 1022/98, bringing presents for the Sultan, who took the opportunity to make a great 114b;98. demonstration in honour of the French. Coincidently with this visit an outbreak occurred at Sur, but it was not of a serious nature and subsided before the end of the year. About the same time, the Sultan dismissed his TTazir, Seyyid Saeed, to whom reference has already been made. This step was, it was believed, taken at the instigation 2488/98.5 of M. Ottavi, a\1io resented the action of the TVazir in May 1897; and it left 2490/98. the Sultan practically in the hands of the French, acting through Abdul Aziz. In November Colonel Meade recommended that he should be empowered to insist upon the Sultan dismissing Abdul Aziz; but before orders could be given on this proposal it was reported in a French newspaper (' Journal des Debats' of 20th November 1898) that a French man-of-war had established a coaling station at Bender Gissah in the Gulf of Oman. It subsequently transpired that the Sultan had consented to this arrangement in Marcli 1898. This was regarded by the Government of India as a breach of the engagement entered into by Saiyid Faisnl in 1891; and Her Majesty's Government, with a caveat as to observance of the Declaration of 1862, approved any measures which the Government of India might think 1162/98. likely to be effective, provided they should not require French concurrence. (Tel. 3rd January 1899.) 1899. —In January M.' Ottavi was specially promoted by the French 5(54/99, Government to the rank of Consul. On the 19th January the Viceroy reported (1) that the Sultan had 15 g. 99 admitted that lie had promised the French- a place for storing coal, but denied that the locality was settled ; (2) that, there being no doubt Bunder Gisseh was the place, H.M.S, ' Sphinx ' had landed a boat's crew there, with instructions to hoist the British flag if a French man-of-war appeared in the harbour; (3) that he proposed to withhold payment of the Muscat subsidy. These proceedings were approved, subject to the proviso that hoisting the British flag did not mean appropriation of territory, but merely prevention of an infringement of the Sultan's Agreement of 1891. The neces sity for hoisting the flag did noc arise; but on the 2r)th January the Government 180/99. of India were authorised to instruct Colonel Meade on the occasion of his approaching visit to Muscat to present an ultimatum to tiie Sultan. This document was to demand from the Sultan a revocation of his agreement with 238/99. the French regarding Bunder Gisseli, the dismissal of Abdul Aziz from his em ployment by the Sultan (but not his deportation), the cessation of unauthorised taxes on British trade, and payment of interest on the overdue indemnity for the losses incurred by British subjects in 1895. The Sultan was also to be advised to order his subjects to use a distinctive flag. The ultimatum was presented to the Sultan by Colonel Meade on the 9th February with a demand for a reply within 4-8 hours. His Highness procrastinated ; but on 345/99. the 14th February Admiral Douglas arrived in his flagship, having been authorised to enforce Colonel Meade's demand, if necessary, provided that there must be no personal collision with the French. The Sultan was summoned to attend on board H.M.S. 'Eclipse'' on the 15th, and after some hesitation decided to obey. He had previously sent to Colonel Meade a notification revoking his gift to the French Government; but he now consented to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Govern ment and to comply fully with all their demands. It may be mentioned that the demands actually made upon the Sultan differed in two respects from those which had received the previous sanction of the Government of India (1) Colonel Meade insisted upon a public announcement of the cancellation of the French agreement. His acting in this respect without 345/99. instructions was not approved by Her Majesty's Government; (2) He insisted not only on the dismissal of Abdul Aziz by the Sultan, but on His Highness promising no longer to receive that individual. Colonel Meade had proposed to add another condition, viz., that the Sultan should agree not to receive representatives of other Powers. This was understood to 190/99. mean Powers which had no treatv rights and to refer to a rumoured intention on the part of Russia to establish a consulate at Muscat; but he was instructed that, under the Declaration of 18f32, we had no right to require the Sultan not to receive representatives of other Powers. On the 251/99. 18th February Colonel Meade reported that the Sultan had fully complied with the demands made uj;on him, including cancellation of the French agreement, prescription to his subjects of the exclusive use of a distinctive flag, and an intimation to the French Consul that he would not receive Abdul Aziz as French Agent. Colonel Meade was authorised to assure the Sultan of. our 251/99. S. 13. B6 effective support, if necessary, provided he should continue to follow our advice, hut not to hoist the British flag for that purpose. [The revocation, under pressure from the British Government, of the Bunder Gisseh concession hy the Sultan led to a lon^ diplomatic negotiation with the French Government, which was not finally settled until August 1900, when an arrangement was arrived at, under which the coal depot at Makalla Pol. 923/00. Cove, which had since 1875 been used hy the British Government, was divided into two approximately equal parts, one of which was accepted by the French.] On the 1st March the Viceroy reported that the attitude of the Sultan was again becoming unfriendly, and that he continued to receive clandestine visits 331/99. from Abdul Aziz, who was endeavouring to cause trouble with the Sharki- yeh tribes. The question of our position at Muscat, under the Declaration of 1862 and the Sultan's engagement of 1891, was therefore submitted for the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown. Their opinion was to the elfect that (1) the Declaration of 1862 does not require the British Government to abstain from exercising a preponderating influence, so long as that influence is not exerted in any way inconsistent with the independence of Muscat; (2) that the British Government would not be precluded from punishing or even deposing any individual Sultan f(5r breaches of engagements, provided the independence of his successor were recognised ; (3) that whilst the question whether the Sultan could bo required to dismiss a particular adviser must depend on the special circumstances of the case, it would hardly be compatible with the independence of Muscat to compel the Sultan to accept ministers and advisers who are acceptable to the British Government. It was, however, decided merely to continue to withhold the subsidy. Towards the middle of 564/99. the month the Sultan became more amenable, but the Government of India preferred to make no further formal demands upon him for the time, although the Customs question and that of the payment of interest on the indemnity remained unsettled, and the maintenance in the office of Wazir of Saiyid Muhammad bin Azzar, who was a creature of the French Consul, caused embarrassment. Before, however, instructions to this effect (dated 660/99. 25th May) reached him. Colonel Meade had already pressed the Sultan to apply for the loan of a British official to manage his Customs (23rd April) and had received from the Sultan a refusal (9th May). His Highness also continued to evade every attempt made by Major Fagan to induce him to undertake to pay due regard to the advice of the British representative. 714/99. Trouble began to arise in May with the tribes, owing to the Sultan's inability to pay them the usual cash presents; and a project was formed by them to dethrone Saiyid Faisul. This, however, came to nothing. Mean while the Sultan declined to take any practical steps for enforcing the 732, 80o, adoption bv his subjects of a distinctive flasr. He appeared to dislike the QQO _ 'I IjQQ ^ ^ • • • idea, though he objected strongly to the French claims to jurisdiction over 4^9 1900. jj-g su }3j eC k S} anc [ i ;e professed to think that the French Government were likely to remedy the existing state of things. 1096,2081, In June the French Government complained that the Political Agent at 2392 of 1899. Muscat had endeavoured to persuade the Sultan to order the discontinuance by his subjects of the use of the French flag, and had offered a British ship of war to enforce compliance. This was denied by the Political Agent, and the matter eventually dropped. 2331/99. In August the French Government, in reply to a note by the Charge d'Affaires at Paris, repeated their declaration (made 16th October 1897) that their undertaking in 1891 to discontinue the issue of their flag to Arab vessels, referred only to their Consulate at Aden; but they admitted that in some cases the flag had been granted without sufficient examination, and stated that they proposed to revise the regulations governing the practice. In 2466/99. November the Secretary of State, with Lord Salisbury's concurrence. No. 47 of forwarded the correspondence to the Government of India, and suggested 1899. for consideration three possible courses which that Government might adopt, Pol 9 398 99 V] ^ Z •' i n ^ uce ^ ie Sultan (1) to insist upon all vessels belonging to his subjects being registered and flying his distinctive flag; or (2) to declare that, alter a specified date, he would not recognise in his territory any protection or naturalisation thereafter conferred on his subjects otherwise than with his7 sanction or under treaty. lie referred also to a suggestion (3) that an extended issue of the British flag might he practised, hut indicated that difficulties would arise from the provisions of the existing law. In an earlier Despatch (No. 37 of the llth August) the Secretary of State 660/90. referred to the question of the subsidy, and suggested, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, that an early resumption of payment of the subsidy would be likely to make forthe re-establishment of a good understanding with the Sultan. On the 80th September Captain Cox, who had been specially selected for the appointment of Political Agent, arrived at Muscat. lie at first abstained from broaching important questions, and confined himself to endeavouring to obtain the Sultan's confidence. In this he met with considerable success; and the Government of India felt justified in autho- ^98/99. rising (13th December) the resumption of payment of the subsidy, with effect from October, the question of the arrears being left in abeyance. The outcome of this step was that the Sultan felt himseli to be in a position to assume the direct control of his Customs, which had previously been farmed out to contractors. This was regarded by the local authorities as a step in the direction of meeting the wishes of the Government of India in this 21^/1901. respect, and the first year's working of the new arrangement proved to be very satisfactory. In November a certain Prenchman, M. Croguyer, who had arrived at 033,949, Muscat earlier in the year and proceeded thence to Bahrein, returned to Muscat and had an audience with the Sultan. He was evidently in close 330'357' relations with M. Ottavi, but his actual business was mysterious. It 456' 1200 subsequently transpired that he was contributing Anglophobe letters to the of 1900 French newspaper ' La Depeche Coloniale,' and also endeavouring to 1017/1900. promote the introduction of French trade goods into Muscat. [A suggestion •' Jf) i^Ol. that the Sultan should take certain steps to put a stop to M. Goguyer's inter ference in Muscat affairs was referred to the Foreign Office on the lOth May 1901; but action of this kind on the part of the Sultan was considered inadvisable, at all events until the Foreign Office had ascertained whether or 1993/1901. not he was an official of the French Government ] 1900. —The Sultan's behaviour during this year continued to be friendly. He co-operated with Captain Cox in carrying out the arrangement with the 1137/1900. French regarding the coaling station in ilakalla Cove; he reinstated Seyyid Saeed as Vizier ; he requested that certain scurrilous leaflets containing lalse 573 1900. information and malicious comments on British policy, which were being disseminated in Muscat, should be suppressed in the post office ; and, further (as reported by the Viceroy in his telegram of the 22iid May), he offered to sign a letter requesting Her Majesty's Government to discuss the flag 543/1900. question with Hie French Government on his behalf. The Foreign Office were indisposed to do more than to offer friendly representations to the 2152/1900. French Government, which, moreover, they did not expect to be ot much practical use. But, before orders were issued, the Sultan visited Sur, in the 039/1900. second week of June, in 11.M.S. Sphinx,' and obtained from three dhow owners the French papers which they held, and from the remainder of the Suri French-protected dhow owners, a solemn undertaking to return their flags and papers to the French authorities on the occasion of their next visit to their port of registry. On his return to Muscat, the Sultan sent the three sets of papers which had been surrendered to him, to M. Ottavi, who, however, refused to accept them. He also issued an edict to the following effect:—' We have 684/1900. ' observed that subjects of ours have ignorantly taken flags and articles from ' a Foreign Government, whereunder they pretend to claim their protection. ' This has taken place in the past, but there must be none of it in the future ' and you must understand that such procedure is contrary to the duties and ' obligations of subjects (to their sovereign). You are hereby informed that we *' do not recognise in our territories {i.e., in the hands of our subjects) such flags and protection papers, and will not pardon anyone who takes them &lt;c otherwise than with our written permission and sanction in accordance 2245 1900. ' with the terms of the treaties between us and Foreign Powers. Let this be &lt;( clear to all.' This edict he communicated to the Consuls on the 15th June; and it was approved by Her Majesty's Government on the clear understanding that it referred only to cases of the issue of flags subsequent to the date of its notification to Foreign Consuls. S. 13. ' Cs Meanwhile the French Government had taken exception to the Sultan's action in this matter, of which they had received an account which differed from Pol. that furnished to Her Majesty's Government hy the British Consul. On the 2195/1900. 25th June, M. Camhon stated to Lord Salisbury that the dispute was one between the Sultan and the French Government, who would have to insist upon restitution ol' the papers, and, if necessary, an apology. He subsequently (26th June) requested Her Majesty's Government) to instruct their Agent toa(l\ise the Sultan to comply. Lord Salisbury declined to commit himself in the absence of full information, and pressed the invalidity of the French claim to grant their protection to the subjects of another Power. M. Cambon stated that the practice would be discontinued for the future, and that existing papers would be examined. Lord Salisbury promised all due respect for French rights and susceptibilities, and suggested the removal of M. Ottavi, who had shown a partisan spirit and caused irritation. On the Oth July the India Office suggested that M. Cambon should be 684 1900. informed that Her Majesty's Government would advise the Sultan to await an examination of the French papers already issued to his subjects before repudiating them, and to arrive at no decision regarding them pending further reference to the Governments of France and Great Britain. The 2245 1900. Foreign Office (17th July) preferred not to again raise the question with the French Government, who would probably decline to admit our right to take part in the examination of doubtful cases promised by M. Cambon, but they approved generally the proposed advice to the Sultan, ihe Viceroy was 2247/1900. ' instructed accordingly (20th July). On the 17th July M. Cambon announced that the French Government were sending a ship partly to establish their new coal depot at Muscat, and partly to enquire into the question whether any dhows flying the French flag were implicated in slave trading. On the 11th August the India Office, in forwarding further papers received from India, suggested that the o2nd Article of the -Brussels Act -o^O/ m ight have some application to the probable objection of the French Govern- ment to our assistance at the examination of papers; and on the 2iith August and 6th September, Lord George Hamilton proposed that the 841, 58 of attention of the French Government should be drawn to certain definite 1900 ' cases of slave trading under their flag reported by Captain Cox, and to 1299/1900. admissions of irregularities under the Brussels Act by the Commander of the *' Drome.' 899 1900. Meanwhile on the 18tli August, the E. F. 'Drome,' arrived at Muscat, and the French authorities at once assumed a threatening attitude towards the Sultan, demanding the return to Sur by the 'Drome,' ol the surrendered papers, and the reception of Abdul Aziz as French intermediary. The Snltan firmly refused. In conversation with Captain Cox the Commander of the ' Drome stated that their demand as to return of the pnpers was in accordance with an understanding with Lord Salisbury, but Captain Cox rejoined that this was not in accordance with his information. On the 26th August the Viceroy reported that he had instructed Captain Cox that the Sultan's attitude seemed correct, but that ilis Highness should 2345/1900. re fuse to discuss doubtful or disputed cases, and in the case of disagree ment should demand a written statement of the French case. ' Ihese instructions were approved by Her Majesty's Government on the ord September. In the meantime two of the Suris who had actually surrendered their papers to the Sultan (the receipt of which from His Higimess had been , refused by M. Ottavi) arrived in Muscat and personally returned their papers ' to M, Ottavi, who accepted them. Other Suri dhows, whose owners had sinned the solemn undertaking to the Sultan, were intercepted by the ' Drome ' on their way to Busrah and induced to come to Muscat flying the French flag. When appealed to by the Sultan to fulfil their promise, they pleaded that they dared not do so in the presence of the ' Drome, ' but would do so later.' Finally, they were furnished by the French Consul with fresh ' crew lists,' and proceeded on their voyage. On the 28th August the Sultan asked for a statement of the French claims in writing. This 1(60 1900. M. Ottavi declined to give. On the 30th the flag question was dropped, but M. Ottavi insisted on the reception of Abdul Aziz. This, also, the Sultan declined, not (Captain Cox reports) through any personal objection, but through fear of displeasing the British Government.On the 4tli September, at a further interview, the Prench Consul definitely 1004 and informed the Sultan that, if he persisted in his refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, 1089/1900. force would be employed to compel his acquiescence. The Sultan then told Captain Cox that if the British (rovemment would not support him in the 9 --/| qoo , event of the French using force, he would have to give in. On the advice of Captain Cox the Sultan then wrote toM. Ottavi recapitulating his version of what had been said on the 4th September, and elicited a confirmation by M. Ottavi in writing of his threat to use force. The Sultan then sent the correspondence to Captain Cox, who thereupon (7th September) addressed a letter to his French colleague inviting his attention to the Declaration of 1862, and stating that in his opinion M. Ottavi's action was incompatible ^ 0 UU/ with the independence of the Sultan, which their respective Governments had mutually agreed to respect, M. Ottavi replied on the 10th September to the effect that he had referred the matter to his Government, and on the 2392/1900. same day the ' Drome ' left Muscat, leaving behind her in charge of the depot an official who speaks Arabic and Swahili fluently . Captain Cox's action was approved by Her Majesty's Government, and the Government oi ! India were instructed to express to the Sultan the appreciation of Her p 0 j ^459/ Majesty's Government of his desire to observe his promises and 1900. engagements. The 'Drome' returned to Muscat on the 16th September and left again 1132/1900. on the 18th without, however, any further communication being made by the French Consul to the Sultan. She finally left the Gulf towards the end of October, merely calling at Muscat and Sur, where her commander enjoined 1299/1900. on the French proteges on no account to surrender their papers. In September a further complication was reported by the Government of 929/190?. India. A certain native of Oman named Hilal-bin-Amr, who had been deported from Zanzibar for intrigues against British influence but had been permitted to return to Zanzibar, arrived at Sur and busied himself in 2197/1897. fomenting dissatisfaction against the Sultan. The Political Resident was authorised to inform the Sultan that he was at liberty to expel this man, in which case he would be sent back to Zanzibar. The Foreign Office under- 1184, 2394 took to discuss with the French Government any claim to French protection ot 190() - which might bo raised by Hilal. The Sultan took the opportunity to 1249/1900. suggest the deportation of a certain Saiyid Ali bin Ali; and the question of getting rid of Abdul Aziz was also raised by the Resident. No report 2648/1900. Z 1 has yet been received of action taken in the two former cases; but the Foreign Office objected to any forcible action in the case of Abdul Aziz so long as he remained in French employ. It was ultimately considered inadvisable, even in the event of his consenting to leave Muscat, to press the 1820/1901. Zanzibar Sultan to receive Abdul Aziz pending the completion of certain negotiations for the surrender of French extra-territorial jurisdiction in Zanzibar. For the rest of the year nothing of great importance was recorded. M. 1132/1900. Ottavi by a stratagem induced the Sultan to give up the third set of French papers surrendered to him at Sur to the son of the owner, on whose appli cation they were at once renewed by the French Consul. A French Agent was also sent to Sur to watch events. The Government of India were not 1184/1900. disposed to sanction a proposal of Captain Cox that a British Agent should also be sent to Sur, nor were they willing for the present to encourage the Sultan, as suggested by Captain Cox, to issue to his subjects articles and crew-lists, printed in Arabic and English, which could be endorsed by the British Consul and so constitute a title to the good offices of British Consuls. Thev, however, renewed their recommendation that the Sultan should be 1166/1900. assured that Her Majesty's Government would discuss the flag question with the French Government. Lord Lansdowne undertook (23rd November 1900) 2r)7u/i900. to remind M. Cambon of his promised investigation at a fitting opportunity. In the latter part of November the French cruiser ' Catinat ' called at 1324/1900. Muscat, and, without making any demands on the Sultan, left on the 30th, Commodore Kiesel having previously announced his intention to repeat his visit next year. At Sur, however, he is reported to have announced that the Sultan had agreed to allow the Suris to retain their French allegiance. To counteract the effect of the 'Catinat's ' visit, the Admiral on the East India 213/1901. Station was requested to show the British flag in the Persian Gulf by as 391/1901.10 many British ships as possible, till March in the following year. This visit had, however, to be postponed Pol. 476/ 1901. 1901 .—Writing on the 3rd February, Captain Cox reported that up to date the Sultan had maintained his firm attitude upon the flag question ; 391/1901. but that in view of the limited character of the support afforded to him by His Majesty's Government, he was apprehensive of the consequences of offending the French Government, while the French Consul wa? endeavour ing to induce the Suris not to abide by their engagement. He further stated that no attempt had been made by the French authorities to discuss with the Sultan the title of any subject of his to fly the Frencli flag. The Foreign Ofiice were therefore reminded (9th April) of Lord Lansdowne's proposed communication with the French Ambassador (letter from the Foreign Office, dated 23rd November 1900), and it was suggested to them that the Sultan should again be advised to press for a statement in writing of the French claims upon him. On the 7th March a Belgian steam yacht, which was said to have been chartered by a party, the leader of which was a French Government official, arrived at Muscat, and the party was introduced by M. Ottavi to the Sultan. They were reported to intend visiting Sohar and the ports of the Pirate Coast. On the 9th March two Hussians, one of whom is reported to be a brother of Major Leontieff of Abyssinian fame, arrived, and were, after some hesitation, received by the Sultan. They subsequently applied for a written permit to import arms, which was refused as unnecessary, and eventually left for Bombay, whence they wrote a complimentary letter to the Sultan, informing him of their intention to return to Muscat after visiting Jibuti. It may be mentioned that in the beginning of April a letter was received at Muscat addressed to the ' Russian Vice-Consul.' On the 16th the ' Korniloff,' the pioneer vessel of the new Russian line to the Persian Gulf, called at Muscat. She gave, and (on the advice of Admiral Bosanquet) received, a salute, as a special compliment on the occasion of her first visit. In consequence of a report from Captain Cox (dated i8th January) that coal of good quality existed in the neighbourhood of Sur, the Government of India deputed a geological expert. Dr. von Krafft, to inspect the coal fields. He proceeded to Sur in May accompanied by Captain Cox, but found the local Arabs obstructive. The Sultan proceeded to Sur to arrange matters, and a gunboat was also ordered to proceed thither. It was suggested to the Foreign Office by the India Office (10th May) that exclusive rights over these coal fields should be secured. The Foreign Office saw no objection, provided the rights were granted by the Sultan not to the Government of India but to a British firm. In a letter of the 3rd April Captain Cox suggested that he should be authorised to advise the Sultan to issue a further Edict, which should practically extend the terms of the Edict communicated to the Foreign Consuls on the 15th June 1900 {see p. 7), to the dhow-owners who had already at that date received French protection. The object was to bring pressure to bear on those dhow-owners to fulfil their undertaking given to 2012/01. the Sultan in June 1900. The Foreign Office, however, have expressed the opinion that the issue of the proposed Edict by the Sultan would not be judicious; and the Government of India have been instructed accordingly. The Foreign Office have been once more pressed to discuss the situation at Muscat with M. Cambon. 544/01. 1988/01. 611/01. Political and Secret Department, 7th June 1901. C. G. C.B. 12!).

Since that date material assistance has repeatedly * been given to successive Sultans to enable them to hold their own against the piratical Arab tribes, as well as against their own rebellious subjects ; treaties of friendship and commerce,f and for the suppression of the slave trade,J have also been concluded with them on several occasions. Saiyid Sultan was succeeded by his two sons, Salim and Said, reigning jointly. Saiyid Salim died in 1821.

Since his death the Government of India has, on several occasions, assumed the role of protecting power, and no Sultan has been able to establish his authority since that date without obtaining the recognition of the British Government. It was by the arbitration of Lord Canning that the dispute between Sultan Said's sons as to the independence of Zanzibar was settled in 1801; and when, on the death of Saiyid Thoweyni of Muscat in 1866, Saiyid Majid of Zanzibar refused to continue to Saiyid Salim and his successor the subsidy awarded by Lord Canning, the Government of India (though they never formally relieved Zanzibar of the liability) undertook, in 1873, to be Enclosure i responsible for the sum (10,000 crowns), subject to the observance by the better^fom |1 Sultan of Muscat of his treaty engagements, and of a friendly attitude India, towards Great Britain. No. 63, dated As regards other Powers, the United States of America concluded a juq 0 J 11116 commercial treaty with Muscat in 1833, France in 1841, and Holland, ' through the instrumentality of the British Resident, in 1877. These treaties, Po1 3 H y9 - as well as our own, all provide for ' most-favoured-nation ' treatment. In 1862, in consequence of Lord Canning's award, it was considered to be necessary that France, having a treaty with Muscat, should consent to recognise tho separate independence of Muscat and Zanzibar. The immediate Po1 - 1 7 17 cause which induced Her Majesty's Government to become a party to the Joint Declaration which was signed between Great Britain and France on the 10th March 1862, appears to have been an apprehension of French aggression in Zanzibar. The declaration, however, in accordance with the view of both ♦ E.g., in 1809, 11SI0, 1874, 1877, 1883, 1895, and 1897. f In 1800, 1839, 1865, and 1891.

He was killed in battle in 18 r 1. H There has been some doubt as to whether this undertaking was personal to Saiyid Turki; but the India Olhce held that it was not—and, as a matter of fact, the subsidy was continued to his successor.

Governments, engaged ** reciprocally to respect the independence of ' the Sovereigns both of Muscat and of Zanzibar. This declaration, so far as Zanzibar is concerned, was abrogated in 1S90; but, «u fai' as Muscat is concerned, remains still in force. The present ruler of Muscat, Saiyid Paisul, was recoguised by the Govern ment of India in 1890, and the subsidy was continued to him. He at that time gave most satisfactory assurances that he would be bound by his father's engagements, and be guided by the advice of the British Government, whose approbation he desired to secure. In the following year he executed a new commercial treaty with Great Britain, and gave a formal undertaking c&lt; never ' to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the ' British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman, or any of their ' dependencies.'* The position which Great Britain had thus acquired in Muscat in 1S91 was part of a larger policy which had for its object a predominance along the whole of the Arab coast from Aden to Bahrein; and, in pursuance of it, protectorate engagements had been entered into with the coast tribes from Bab-el-Mandeb to Has Sair, viz., the Subaihi, Akrabi, Padthli, Aulaki, Wahidi, Dhuyaibi, 'Irka, Kaieti and Mahri, up to the boundary of Dhol'ar, which latter had been an integral part of Muscat dominions since 1879. In 1890 the Government of India had proposed to assert a virtual protectorate over Muscat, of which at least five-sixths of the trade was in the hands of British subjects, but the Declaration of 1862 was considered to stand in the way. jQ95 t —Early in 1895 a rebellion, which promised at first to be successful, broke out in Oman, probably in the interests of the Sultan of Zanzibar, The Government of India sent a ship of war to protect British subjects, but, in accordance with the lines of policy which had been indicated by Lord Kimberley in his Despatch, No. 25, of the 31st March 1880, an attitude of the strictest neutrality towards the rival parties was adopted ; and, when the revolt finally collapsed, they insisted upon the Sultan levying from the re bellious tribes an indemnity for losses sustained by British traders, and, it was eventually arranged, by others. At the same time, however, a loan of Rs. ()0,000 was made to the Sultan. For the protection of our interests against similar risks in the future, three alternative courses were subse quently suggested by the local authorities, viz., (1) annexation; (2) a protectorate; and (3) an intimation to the leading Sheikhs that Maskat and Mattrah must not be attacked. The first two courses were held to be barred by the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, the abrogation of which it was not considered opportune to propose to the French Government. The third course was approved by Her Majesty s Government. It is probable that the attitude of the Government of India on the occasion of the rebellion in 1895 may have had something to do with a change in the disposition of Saiyid Faisul, to which attention was drawn by Major Hayes Sadler early in 1890; but another influence also was at work, which has since that time caused much trouble. In the year 1881 the French Government had availed themselves of their right to appoint Consuls (secured to them by their Treaty with Muscat of the 17th November 1844) to the extent of appointing a Consular Agent at Muscat; but in 1894 they established a Vice-Consulate, and transferred M. Ottavi from Zanzibar to fill the new post. In 1893 there had arrived in Muscat a certain Arab named Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad, Ruwaihi, a native of Semail in Oman, who had been confidential secretary to Sultan Seyyid Ali of Zanzibar and had been deported by Seyyid Ali's successor, Seyyid Hamid, for anti-British intrigue. This man was taken into Saiyid Faisul's service as munshi; and, on the arrival of M. Ottavi, whom he had known in Zanzibar, he was permitted by the Sultan also to enter the service of the French Vice-Consulate. Another sign of the increased interest taken by the French Government in Muscat affairs, was the visit of a French gunboat on the occasion of the rebellion, though it did not actually interfere. »This engagement was regarded us a Secret engagement until early in 1899, when Lord Salisbury mentioned its purport to M. Cambon (1781/99). *3 1896. —In 1890 on the occasion of the Dhofar rebellion, when it was proposed to send a ship-of-war to assist the Sultan, Her Majesty's H.C. 273/96. Government found it necessary to give to the French Government an assurance ' that the action which it is proposed to take implies no intention on the part of Her Majesty's Government of establishing any Protectorate ' over Muscat' (27th March 1890). The ellect upon the Sultan of French activity began soon to be felt. At India Letter, the commencement of the troubles in Dhofar, in his anxiety to restore his 123, and authority, he was ready to accept our advice and assistance. Suddenly. ^ orel o n however, he changed his mind ; and Major Ilayes Sadler reported that the Letter, Sultan's replies to the British Consul's communications were drafted by dated 30th Abdul Aziz, through whom, there was good reason to believe, the correspon- June 189G - dence had been shown to M. Ottavi. At the same time intrigues, in which h. C. 660/96. the Sultan was said to be concerned, were reported to be taking place between M. Ottavi and certain of the Trucial Chiefs of the Pirate Coast. The question 590/96. of a British Protectorate was, in consequence, again raised by the India Office in a letter to the Foreign Office of the 1st July, but the reply (dated 9th July) still was to the effect that ' present conditions arc very far from favourable to the prospect of' an 'arrangement with France by which an exclusive British Protectorate should be established over Oman.' Notwithstanding tiie unfriendly attitude assumed in the early part of the year by the Sultan, when, in December 1896, he showed signs of a desire to take action against the Dhofar rebels, the Government of India again offered g ecret their assistance and advice, Her Majesty's Government having previously Despatch, instructed them to endeavour to maintain influence over, and amicable No. 38, relations with, the Sultan. An offer of further financial assistance was also ( i at ^ made to him, provided he would manifest confidence in British goodwill. ' ^ ' 1897. —In the middle of January the Sultan became more favourably Pol.200/97. disposed, and he asked for the assistance of a British ship of war for the reduction of the Dhofar rebellion. This request was complied with, subject 1728/97. to conditions, imposed by the Foreign Office in order to meet French susceptibilities, that she should help only with her guns and not land any force, and that nothing should be done which would imply encroachment on 848/97. the independence of the Sultan ; moreover, a further sum of Rs. 60,000 was subsequently lent by] the Government of India towards extricating Saiyid Faisul from his embarrassments. It may be mentioned that immediately after this arrangement had been made a French gunboat arrived at Muscat, and her services were understood to have been offered to the Sultan and declined by him. Finally the mere presence of H.M.S. 'Cossack ' at Dhofar 398/97. proved sufficient to secure a bloodless victory for the Sultan, who was cordial in his acknowledgments. This temporary (as it proved) change in Saiyid 583/97. Faisul's attitude was probably due to the influence of the AVazir, Seyyid Saeed, whose sympathies were in favour of the British Government. In May 1897 he had (at the instance of the British Consul) induced the Sultan to protest against the French claim to jurisdiction over Suri dhows flying the French flag. It may be convenient here to state briefly the modus operandi of the Enclosure 2 French authorities in this matter, as described by Captain Cox. The captain of a dhow, whether he be owner or not, presents himself at a French ^ ^ Consulate or to the authorities in a French possession, e.g., Obokh, Jibuti, dated ^Madagascar, Zanzibar or the Comoro Islands, even in some instances 26th July at Muscat. He applies for a French flag, and is told that he must qualify 1 OOC) - either by acquiring a house or land in a French possession, or else by producing security in the person cither of a French protected resident or of an Arab in possession of a French flag. The latter is the alternative usually adopted. When the flag and tit re de navigation have been granted, the dhow enjoys immunity from being overhauled by British cruisers* ; and in the case of anything happening to her, the French authorities claim to protect the captain, if he produces his tit re de navigation, whether he is the owner or not. * On the other hand, the Law Officers of the Crown are of opinion that in territorial waters the vessels maybe searched and proceeded against for slave trading; and that, if the French Gcve.-ninent fail to stop the abuse of their protection, the vessels may be treated even on the high tens as not entitled to the protection of the French flag.

This practice had been a subject of complaint by the Indian Government ever since 1891, when the French Government made a promise to discontinue it, but only, as they subsequently (16th October 1897) explained, so far as their Consulate at Aden was concerned. The ground of complaint was, primarily, that it threw grave difficulties in the way of carrying out the Act of the Brussels Conference in regard to the Slave Trade. Though discontinued at Aden» the practice was reported in 1892 to continue at Madagascar (India Letter No. 4.6), at Obolvh (Nos. 66 and 98), and (No. 231 of 1892) it was stated that its discontinuance would be even more effectual than systematic cruisin^ in stopping the slave trade. In 1893, it was proposed that the Sultan of Muscat should be invited to subscribe to Chapter IV. of the Act of the Brussels Conference; but the proposal was not carried out, partly because it was at the time understood that the Act was not to apply to the Persian Gulf, and partly for fear of em barrassment with the French. In 1894 the Government of India instructed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to advise the Saltan to inform the French A r ice-Consul that the assertion of French protection over Suri boats in Oman waters would be a contravention of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. Her Majesty's Government approved these instructions. In September 1896 the question was brought prominently forward owing to the seizure by II.M.S. 'Sphinx' of two dhows flying French colours, which were found to be full of slaves. They were handed over to the French Consul at Muscat for adjudication; and a repre sentation was made to the French Government, who, while stating that these cases would be dealt with, denied that they had ever had any intention of discontinuing the grant of French papers to Suri dhows. The Government of India thereupon revived the suggestion that the Sultan should adhere to the Act of the Brussels Conference ; but the Foreign Office preferred a pro posal that the Sultan should be advised to institute a distinctive flag for the use of vessels belonging to his subjects. 1747/98.

He declined to hoist the British flag as usual on that day, at the instance, it was said, of the French Vice-Consul, in order to show his independence of the Govern ment of India. (The Resident, who was present, had, however, no difficulty in inducing him to apologise, and the flag was hoisted with a salute on the 3rd January.) He agreed without difficulty to issuing a proclamation w r ith regard to the arms traffic; but he was obstructive in the matter of adjudi cating on the arms seized in the' Baluchistan.' His attitude in this matter also was attributed to French intrigues. Again a proposal was made to him that he should appoint a British officer to control his customs, with a view to remedy grievances under which British Indian traders were suffering. Nothing, however, was done, nor were any steps taken by him to remedy the grievances. In March the Government of India reported on the proposal to induce the Sultan to institute a distinctive flag for his subjects to the effect that, ' so long as facilities for obtaining French flags and papers exist, no ' distinctive flag can successfully be introduced by the Sultan among his ' subjects at Sur.' A strong representation was then made by the India Office to the Foreign Office with a view to Her Majesty's Government taking up the question with the French Government (23rd May 1898). This the Foreign Office eventually (20th December 1898) declined to do, on the ground that Her Majesty's Government had no locus standi, as 'Muscat is not a British Protectorate,' and Her Majesty's Government had 'received no request from the Sultan to do so.' The Government of India were then instructed to revert to the proposed prescription of a distinctive flag. Meanwhile, in October, the French gunboat ' Scorpion ' visited Muscat, bringing presents for the Sultan, who took the opportunity to make a great demonstration in honour of the French. Coincidently w 7 ith this visit an outbreak occurred at Sur, but it was not of a serious nature and subsided before the end of the year. About the same time, the Sultan dismissed his Wazir, Scvvid Saeed, to whom reference has already been made. This step was, it was believed, taken at the instigations&gt; through and it left 2490/98, Abdul of M. Ottavi, who resented the action of the TTazir in May 1897; the Sultan practically in the hands of the French, acting Aziz. In November Colonel Meade recommended that he should be empowered to insist upon the Sultan dismissing Abdul Aziz; but before orders could be given on this proposal it was reported in a French newspaper Journal des Debats' of 20th November 1898) that a Prench man-of- war had established a coaling station at Bender Gissah in the Gulf of Oman. It subsequently transpired that the Sultan had consented to this arrangement in March 1898. This was regarded by the Government of India as a breach of the engagement entered into by Saiyid Faisul in 1891 ; and Her Majesty's Government, with a caveat as to observance of the Declaration of 1862, approved any measures which the Government of India might think 1162/98. likely to be effective, provided they should not require French concurrence. (Tel. 3rd January 1899.) 564/99. 158/99. 180/99. 238/99. 1899. —In January M. T Ottavi was specially promoted by the French Government to the rank of Consul. On the 19th January the Viceroy reported (1) that the Saltan had admitted that he had promised the French a place for storing coal, but denied that the locality was settled; (2) that, there being no doubt Bunder Gisseh was the place, H.M.S. C£ Sphinx ' had lauded a boat's crew there, with instructions to hoist the British flag if a French man-of-war appeared in the harbour; (3) that he proposed to withhold payment of the Muscat subsidy. These proceedings were approved, subject to the proviso that hoisting the British flag did not mean appropriation of territory, but merely prevention of an infringement of the Sultan's Agreement of 1891. The neces sity for hoisting the flag did noc arise; but on the 25th January the Government of India were authorised to instruct Colonel Meade on the occasion of his approaching visit to Muscat to present an ultimatum to the Sultan. This document was to demand from the Sultan a revocation of his agreement with the French regarding Bunder Gisseh, the dismissal of Abdul Aziz from his em ployment by the Sultan (but not his deportation), the cessation of unauthorised taxes on British trade, and payment of interest on the overdue indemnity for the losses incurred by British subjects in 1895. The Sultan Avas also to be advised to order his subjects to use a distinctive flag. The ultimatum was presented to the Sultan by Colonel Meade on the 9th February with a demand for a reply within 48 hours. His Highness procrastinated ; but on 345/99. the 14th February Admiral Douglas arrived in his flagship, having been authorised to enforce Colonel Meade's demand, if necessary, provided that there must be no personal collision with the French. The Sultan was summoned to attend on board H.M.S. 'Eclipse' on the 15th, and after some hesitation decided to obey. He had previously sent to Colonel Meade a notification revoking his gift to the French Government; but he now consented to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Govern ment and to comply fully with all their demands. It may be mentioned that the demands actually made upon the Sultan differed iu two respects from those which had received the previous sanction of the Government of India (1) Colonel Meade insisted upon a public announcement of the cancellation of the French agreement. His acting in this respect without 345/99. instructions was not approved by Her Majesty's Government; (2) He insisted not only on the dismissal of Abdul Aziz by the Sultan, but on His Highness promising no longer to receive that individual. Colonel Meade had proposed to add another condition, viz., that the Sultan should agree not to receive representatives of other Powers. This was understood to 190/99. mean Powers which had no treatv rights and to refer to a rumoured o intention on the part of Ilussia to establish a consulate at Muscat; but he was instructed that, under the Declaration of 1862, we had no right to require the Sultan not to receive representatives of other Powers. On the 251/99. 18th February Colonel Meade reported that the Sultan had fully complied with the demands made upon him, including cancellation of the French agreement, prescription to his subjects of the exclusive use of a distinctive flag, and an intimation to the French Consul that he would not receive Abdul Aziz as FVench Agent. Colonel Meade was authorised to assure the Sultan of our 251/99. S. 13. B6 Pol. 923/00. 331/99. 564/99. 660/99. 714/99. 732, 80o, 998 of 1899. 489/1900. 1096, 2081, 2392 of 1899. 2331/99. 2466/99.

[The revocation, under pressure from the British Government, of the Bunder Gisseh concession by the Sultan led to a lon^ diplomatic negotiation with the French Government, which was not finally settled until August 1900, when an arrangement was arrived at, under which the coa! depot at Makalla Covo, which had since 1S75 been used by the British Government, was divided into two approximately equal parts, one of which was accepted by the French.] On the 1st March the Viceroy reported that the attitude of the Sultan was again becoming unfriendly, and that he continued to receive clandestine visits from Abdul Aziz, who was endeavouring to cause trouble with the Sharki- yeh tribes. The question of our position at Muscat, under the Declaraticn of 1862 and the Sultan's engagement of 1891, was therefore submitted for the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown. Their opinion was to the effect that (1) the Declaration of 1862 does not require the British Government to abstain from exercising a preponderating influence, so long as that influence is not exerted in any way inconsistent with the independence of Muscat; (2) that the British Government would not be precluded from punishing or even deposing any individual Sultan for breaches of engagements, provided the independence of Ms successor were recognised; (3) that whilst the question whether the Sultan could be required to dismiss a particular adviser must depend on the special circumstances of ihe case, it would hardly be compatible with the independence of Muscat to compel the Sultan to accept ministers and advisers who are acceptable to the British Government. It was, however, decided merely to continue to withhold the subsidy. Towards the middle of the month the Sultan became more amenable, but the Government of India preferred to make no further formal demands upon him for the time, although the Customs question and that of the payment of interest on the indemnity remained unsettled, and the maintenance in the office of Wazir of Saiyid Muhammad bin Azzar, who was a creature of the French Consul, caused embarrassment. Before, however, instructions to this effect (dated 25th May) reached him, Colonel Meade had already pressed the Sultan to apply for the loan of a British official to manage his Customs (23rd April) and had received from the Sultan a refusal (9th May). His Highness also continued to evade every attempt made by Major Fagan to induce him to undertake to pay due regard to the advice of the British representative. Trouble began to arise in May with the tribes, owing to the Sultan's inability to pay them the usual cash presents; and a project was formed by them tt) dethrone Saiyid Faisul. This, however, came to nothing. Mean while the Sultan declined to take any practical steps for enforcing the adoption by his subjects of a distinctive flag. He appeared to dislike the idea, though he objected strongly to the French claims to jurisdiction over his subjects, and he professed to think that the French Government were likely to remedy the existing state of things. In June the French Government complained that the Political Agent at Muscat iiad endeavoured to persuade the Sultan to order the discontinuance by his subjects of the use of the French flag, and had offered a British ship of war to enforce compliance. This was denied by the Political Agent, and the matter eventually dropped. In August the French Government, in reply to a note by the Charge d'Affaires at Faris, repeated their declaration (made 16th October 1897) that their undertaking in 1891 to discontinue the issue of their flag to Arab vessels, referred only to their Consulate at Aden; but they admitted that in some cases the flag had been granted without sufficient examination, and stated that they proposed to revise the regulations governing the practice. In November the Secretary of State, with Lord Salisbury's concurrence, forwarded the correspondence to the Government of India, and suggested for consideration three possible courses which that Government might adopt, viz., to induce the Sultan (I) to insist upon all vessels belonging to his subjects being registered and flying his distinctive flag; or (2) to declare that, alter a specified date, he would not recognise in his territory any protection or naturalisation thereafter conferred on his subjects otherwise than with his7 sanction or under treaty. lie referred also to a suggestion (3) that an extended issue of the British flag might he practised, hut indicated that difficulties would arise from the provisions of the existing law. In an earlier Despatch (No. 37 of the 11th August) the Secretary of State 660/99. referred to the question of the subsidy, and suggested, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, that an early resumption of payment of the subsidy would be likely to make for the re-establishment of a good understanding with the Sultan. On the 30th September Captain Cox, who had been specially selected for the appointment of Political Agent, arrived at Muscat. lie at first abstained from broaching important questions, and confined himself to endeavouring to obtain the Sultan's confidence. In this he met with considerable success ; and the Government of India felt justified in autho- ^98/99. rising (13th Deceml3er) the resumption of payment of the subsidy, with effect from October, the question of the arrears being left in abeyance. The outcome of this step was that the Sultan felt himself to be in a position to assume the direct control of his Customs, which had previously been farmed out to contractors. This was regarded by the local authorities as a step in the direction of meeting the wishes of the Government of India in this 2li!/l90l. respect, and the first year's working of the new arrangement proved to be very satisfactory. In ^November a certain Prenchmnn, M. Goguyer, who had arrived at 033,949, Muscat earlier in the year and proceeded thence to Bahrein, returned to Muscat and had an audience with the Sultan. He was evidently in close 330 ' relations with M. Ottavi, but his actual business was mysterious. It 45^' 1200 subsequently transpired that he was contributing Anglophobe letters to the of 1900 French newspaper ' La Depeche Coloniale/' and also endeavouring to 1017 /1900. promote the introduction of French trade goods into Muscat. [A suggestion 646 /1901. that the Sultan should take certain steps to put a stop to M. Goguyer's inter ference in Muscat affairs was referred to the Foreign Office on the 10th May 1901 ; but action of this kind 011 the part of the Sultan was considered inadvisable, at all events until the Foreign Office had ascertained whether or 1993/1901. not he was an official of the French Government ] 1900. —The Sultan's behaviour during this year continued to be friendly. He co-operated with Captain Cox in carrying out the arrangement with the 1137/1900. French regarding the coaling station in Makalla Cove; he reinstated Seyyid Saeed as Vizier ; he requested that certain scurrilous leaflets containing lalse 573 1900. information and malicious comments on British policy, which were being disseminated in Muscat, should be suppressed in the post office ; and, further (as reported by the Viceroy in his telegram of the 22nd May), he offered to sign a letter requesting Her Majesty's Government to discuss the flag 543/1900. question with the French Government on his behalf. The Foreign Office were indisposed to do more than to offer friendly representations to the 2152/1900. French Government, which, moreover, they did not expect to be of much practical use. But, before orders were issued, the Sultan visited Sur, in the 639/1900. second week of June, in H.M.S. ' Sphinx,' and obtained from three dhow owners the French papers which they held, and from the remainder of the Suri French-protected dhow owners, a solemn undertaking to return their flags and papers to the French authorities on the occasion of their next visit to their port of registry. On his return to Muscat, the Sultan sent the three sets of papers which had been surrendered to him, to M. Ottavi, who, however, refused to accept them. He also issued an edict to the following effect:—' We have 684/1900. ' observed that subjects of ours have ignorantly taken flags and articles from ' a Foreign Government, whereunder they pretend to claim their protection. ' This has taken place in the past, but there must be none of it in the future ' and you must understand that such procedure is contrary to the duties and ' obligations of subjects (to their sovereign). You arc hereby informed that we ' do not recognise in our territories (i .e., in the hands of our subjects) such ' flags and protection papers, and will not pardon anyone who takes them ' otherwise than with our written permission and sanction in accordance 2245 1900, ' with the terms of the treaties between us and Foreign Powers. Let this be ' clear to all.' This edict he communicated to the Consuls on the 15th June; and it was approved by Her Majesty's Government on the clear understanding that it referred only to cases of the issue of flags subsequent to the date of its notification to Foreign Consuls.

On the 25th June, M. Cambon stated to Lord Salisbury that the dispute was one between the Sultan and the French Government, who would have to insist upon restitution of the papers, and, if necessary, an apology. He subsequently (•26th Juno) requested Her Majesty's Government to instruct their Agent to advise the Sultan to comply. Lord Salisbury declined to commit himself in the absence of full information, and pressed the invalidity of the French claim to grant their protection to the subjects of another Power. M. Cambon stated that the practice would be discontinued for the future, and that existing papers Mould be examined. Lord Salisbury promised all due respect 1 for French rights and susceptibilities, and suggested the removal of M Ottavi, who had shown a partisan spirit and caused irritation. On the Oth July the India Office suggested that M. Cambon should be informed that Her Majesty's Government would advise the Sultan to await an examination of the French papers already issued to his subjects before repudiating them, and to arrive at no decision regarding them pending further reference to the Governments of 1 ranee and Great 13iitain. ihe Foreign Office (17th July) preferred not to again raise the question with the French Government, who would probably declme to admit our right to take part in the examination of doubtful cases promised by M. Cambon, but they approved generally the proposed advice to the Sultan, ihe Viceroy yas instructed accordingly (20th July). On the 17th Jul\ M. Cambon announced that the French Government were sending a ship partly to establish their new coal depot at Muscat, and partly to enquire into the question whether any dhows flying the French flag were implicated in slave trading. On the Uth August the India Office, in forwarding further papers received from India, suggested that the 32nd Article &lt;&gt;1 the Biussels Aci&lt; might have some application to the probable objection of the French Govern ment to our assistance at the examination of papers; and on the 21th August and Gth September, Lord George Hamilton proposed that^ the attention of the French Government should be drawn to certain detinite cases of slave trading under their flag reported by Captain Cox, and to admissions of irregularities under the Brussels Act 1a the Commandei ot the 'Drome/' ^ % ,, , ' , r Meanwhile on the 18th August, the R. F. ' Drome, arrived at Muscat, and the French authorities at once assumed a threatening ^attitude towards the Sultan, demanding the return to Sur by the 'Drome, of the surrendered papers, and the reception of Abdul Aziz as French intormediary. The Sultan tirmlv refused. In conversation with Captain Cox the Commander of the*' Drome' stated that their demand as to return of the papers was in accordance with an understanding with Lord Salisbury, but Captain Cox rejoined that this was not in accordance with his iniormation. On the 26th August the Viceroy reported that he had instructed Captain Cox that the Sultan's attitude seemed correct, but that His Highness should not refuse to discuss doubtful or disputed cases, and in the case of disagree ment should demand a written statement of the Irench case. ihese instructions were approved by Her Majesty's Government on the 3rd September In the meantime two of the Suris who had actually surrendered their papers to the Sultan (the receipt of which from His Highness had been refused by M. Ottavi) arrived in Muscat and personally returned their papers to M. Ottavi, who accepted them. Other Suri dhows, whose owners had signed the solemn undertaking to the Sultan, were intercepted b\ the 'Drome ' on their way to Busrah and induced to come to Muscat flying the French flag. When appealed to by the Sultan to fulfil their promise, ihey pleaded that they dared not do so in the presence of the ' Drome,' but would do so later.' Finally, they were furnished by the French Consul with fresh ' crew lists,' and proceeded on their voyage. On the 28th August the Sultan asked for a statement of the French claims in writing, llus M. Ottavi declined to give. On the 30th the flag question was dropped, but M. Ottavi insisted on the reception of Abdul Aziz. This, also, the Sultan declined, not (Captain Cox reports) through any personal objection, but through fear of displeasing the British Government.9 On the 4th September, at a further interview, the French Consul definitely 1004 and informed ihe Sultan that, if he persisted in his refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, 1089/1900. force would be employed to compel his acquiescence. I he Sultan then told Captain Cox that if the British Government would not support him in the 95r , 1900 event of the Prench using force, he would have to give in. On the advice of Captain Cox the Sultan then wrote to M. Ottavi recapitulating his version of what had been said on the 4th September, and elicited a confirmation by M. Ottavi in writing of his threat to use'force. The Sultan then sent the correspondence to Captain Cox, who thereupon (7th September) addressed a letter to his French colleague inviting his attention to the Declaration of 1862, and stating that in his opinion M. Ottavi's action was incompatible with the independence of the Sultan, which their respective Governments had mutually agreed to respect. M. Ottavi replied on the 10th September to the effect that he had referred the matter to his Government, and on the 2392/1900. same day the ' Drome ' left Muscat, leaving behind her in charge of the depot an official who speaks Arabic and Swahili fluently . Captain Cox s action was approved by Her Majesty's Government, and the Government of India were instructed to express to the Sultan the appreciation of iler p ol 2459/ Majesty's Government of his desire to observe his promises and 1900. engagements. The 'Drome' returned to Muscat on the 16th September and Lft again 1132/1900. on the 18th without, however, any further communication being made by the French Consul to the Sultan. She finally left the Gulf towards the end of October, merely calling at Muscat and Sur, where her commander enjoined 1299 /1900. on the French proteges on no account to surrender their papers. In September a further complication was reported by the Government of 929/190?. India. A certain native of Oman named Hilal-bin-Amr, who had been deported from Zanzibar for intrigues against British influence but had been permitted to return to Zanzibar, arrived at Sur and busied himselt in 2197/1897. fomenting dissatisfaction against the Sultan. The Political Ilesident was authorised to inform the Sultan that he was at liberty to expel this man, in which case he would be sent back to Zanzibar. The Foreign Olllce under- 1184, 2394 took to discuss with the French Government any claim to Prench protection ol 1900 - which might be raised by Hilal. The Sultan took the opportunity to 1249/1900. suggest the deportation of a certain Saiyid Ali bin Ali; and the question of getting rid of Abdul Aziz was also raised by the Resident. No report 2648/1900. has yet been received of action taken in the two former cases; but the Foreign Office objected to any forcible action in the case of Abdul Aziz so long as he remained in French employ. It was ultimately considered inadvisable, even in the event of his consenting to leave Muscat, to press the 1820/1901. Zanzibar Sultan to receive Abdul Aziz pending the completion of certain r negotiations for the surrender of French extra-territorial jurisdiction in Zanzibar. For the rest of the year nothing of great importance was recorded. M. 1132/1900. Ottavi by a stratagem induced the Sultan to give up the third set of French papers surrendered to him at Sur to the son of the owner, on vvnose appli cation they were at once renewed by the French Consul. A French Agent was also sent to Sur to watch events. The Government of India were not 1184/1900. disposed to sanction a proposal of Captain Cox that a British Agent should also be sent to Sur, nor were they willing for the present to encourage the Sultan, as suggested by Captain Cox, to issue to his subjects articles and crew-lists, printed in Arabic and English, which could be endorsed by the British Consul and so constitute a title to the good offices of British Consuls. They, however, renewed their recommendation that the Sultan should be 1166/1900. assured that Her Majesty's Government would discuss the flag question with the French Government. Lord Lansdowne undertook (23rd November 1900) 2570/1900. to remind M. Cambon of his promised investigation at a fitting opportunity. In the latter part of November the French cruiser ' Catinat called at 1324/1900. Muscat, and, without making any demands on the Sultan, left on the 30th, Commodore Kiesel having previously announced his intention to repeat his visit next year. At Sur, however, he is reported to have announced that the Sultan had agreed to allow the Suris to retain their French allegiance. To counteract the effect of the 'Catinat's visit, the Admiral on the East India 213/1901. Station was requested to show the British flag in the Persian Gull by as 391/1901.10 many British ships as possible. This visit had, however, to be postponed till March in the following year. Pol. 476/ 1901. 1901 .—Writing on the 3rd February, Captain Cox reported that up to date the Sultan had maintained his firm attitude upon the flag question ; 391/1901. but that in view of the limited character of the support afforded to him by His Majesty's Government, he was apprehensive of the consequences of offending the French Government, while the French Consul was endeavour ing to induce the Suris not to abide by their engagement. He further stated that no attempt had been made by the French authorities to discuss with the Sultan the title of any subject of his to fly tbe Frencli flag. The Foreign Office were therefore reminded (9th April) of Lord Lansdowne's proposed communication with tbe French Ambassador (letter from the Foreign Office, dated 23rd November 1900), and it was suggested to them that the Sultan should again be advised to press for a statement in writing of the French claims upon him. On the 7th March a Belgian steam yacht, which was said to have been chartered by a party, the leader of which was a French Government official, arrived at Muscat, and the party was introduced by M. Ottavi to the Sultan. They were reported to intend visiting Sohar and the ports of the Pirate Coast. On the 9th March two Russians, one of whom is reported to be a brother of Major Leontieff of Abyssinian fame, arrived, and were, after some hesitation, received by the Sultan. They subsequently applied for a written permit to import arms, which was refused as unnecessary, and eventually left for Bombay, whence they wrote a complimentary letter to the Sultan, informing him of their intention to return to Muscat after visiting Jibuti. It may be mentioned that in the beginning of April a letter was received at Muscat addressed to the ' Russian A^ice-Consul.' On the 16th the 44 Korniloff,' the pioneer vessel of the new Russian line to the Persian Gulf, called at Muscat. She gave, and (on the advice of Admiral Bosanquet) received, a salute, as a special compliment on the occasion of her first visit. In consequence of a report from Captain Cox (dated i8th January) that coal of good quality existed in the neighbourhood of Sur, the Government of India deputed a geological expert. Dr. von Krafft, to inspect the coal fields. He proceeded to Sur in May accompanied by Captain Cox, but found the local Arabs obstructive. The Sultan proceeded to Sur to arrange matters, and a gunboat was also ordered to proceed thither. It was suggested to the 54-4/01. Foreign Office by the India Office (10th May) that exclusive rights over these coal fields should be secured. The Foreign Office saw no objection, 1988/01. provided the rights were granted by the Sultan not to the Government of India but to a British firm. Gii/Oi. In a letter of the 3rd April Captain Cox suggested that he should be authorised to advise the Sultan to issue a further Edict, which should practically extend the terms of the Edict communicated to the Foreign Consuls on the 15th June 1900 (see p. 7), to the dhow-owners who had already at that date received French protection. The object was to bring pressure to bear on those dhow-owners to fulfil their undertaking given to 2012/01. the Sultan in June 1900. The Foreign Office, however, have expressed the opinion that the issue of the proposed Edict by the Sultan would not be judicious; and the Government of India have been instructed accordingly. The Foreign Office have been once more pressed to discuss the situation at Muscat with M. Cambon. Political and Secret Department, 7th June 1901. C. G. C.B. 12!): Confidential. This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. 1901. MUSCAT. The connection between the Government of India and the Sultans of Muscat dates back to 1798, when the first agreement between Saiyid Sultan (who was killed in 1801), and the East India Company was executed at a time when Napoleon I. was believed to contemplate making Muscat a base for attacking India. Since that date material assistance has repeatedly* been given to successive Sultans to enable them to hold their own against the piratical Arab tribes, as well as against their own rebellious subjects ; treaties of friendship and commerce,! and for the suppression of the slave trade,J have also been concluded with them on several occasions. Saiyid Sultan was succeeded by his two sons, Salim and Said, reigning jointly. Saiyid Salim died in 1821. Saiyid Said reigned till his death in 1856, when he left, amongst other issue, four Sons: See Aitclii- son's Treaties, Vol. XI., p. 3P. Majid, Sultan of Zanzibar.

Since his' death the Government of India has, on several occasions, assumed the role of protecting power, and no Sultan lias been able to establish his authority since that date without obtaining the recognition of the British Government. It was by the arbitration of Lord Canning that the dispute between Sultan Said's sons as to the independence of Zanzibar was settled in 1861; and when, on the death of Saiyid Thoweyni of Muscat in 1866, Saiyid Majid of Zanzibar refused to continue to Saiyid Salim and his successor the subsidy awarded by Lord Canning, the Government of India (though they never formally relieved Zanzibar of the liability) undertook, in 1873, to be responsible for the sum (40,000 crowns), subject to the observance by the 11Sultan of Muscat of his treaty engagements, and of a friendly attitude towards Great Britain. As regards other Powers, the United States of America concluded a commercial treaty with Muscat in 1833, France in 1844, and Uolland, through the instrumentality of the British Resident, in 1877. These treaties, as well as our own, all provide for ' most-favoured-nation ' treatment. In 1862, in consequence of Lord Canning's award, it was considered to be necessary that France, having a treaty with Muscat, should consent to recognise the separate independence of Muscat and Zanzibar. The immediate P 01 -1717/99. cause which induced Her Majesty's Government to become a party to the Joint Declaration which was signed between Great Britain and France on the 10th March 1862, appears to have been an apprehension of French aggression in Zanzibar.

He was killed in battle in 1871. || There has been some doubt as to whether this undertaking was personal to Saiyid Turki; but the India Office held that it was not—and, as a matter of fact, the subsidy was continued to his successor.

Governments, engaged ' reciprocally to respect the independence of ' the Sovereigns both of Muscat and of Zanzibar. This declaration, so far as Zanzibar is concerned, was abrogated in 1890; but, so fat* as Muscat is concerned, remains still in force. The present ruler of Muscat, Saiyid Paisul, was recognised by the Govern ment of India in 1890, and the subsidy was continued to him. He at that time gave most satisfactory assurances that he would be bound by his father's engagements, and be guided by the advice of the British Government, whose approbation he desired to secure. In the following year he executed a new commercial treaty with Great Britain, and gave a formal undertaking ' never ' to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the ' British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman, or any of their ' dependencies.'* The position which Great Britain had thus acquired in Muscat in 1891 was part of a larger policy which had for its object a predominance along the whole of the xlrab coast from Aden to Bahrein; and, in pursuance of it, protectorate engagements had been entered into with the coast tribes from Bab-eMlandeb to Has Sair, viz., the Subaihi, Akrabi, Fadthli, Aulaki, Wahidi, Dhuyaibi, 'Irka, Kaieti and Mahri, up to the boundary of Dhofar, which latter had been an integral part of Muscat dominions since 1879. In 1890 the Government of India had proposed to assert a virtual protectorate over Muscat, of which at least five-sixths of the trade was in tho hands of British subjects, but the Declaration of 1862 was considered to stand in the way. 1895. ,—Early in 1895 a rebellion, which promised at first to be successful, broke out in Oman, probably in the interests of the Sultan of Zanzibar, The Government of India sent a ship of war to protect British subjects, but, in accordance with the lines of policy which had been indicated by Lord Kimberley in his Despatch, No. 25, of the 31st March 188(5, an attitude of the strictest neutrality towards the rival parties was adopted ; and, when the revolt finally collapsed, they insisted upon the Sultan levying from the re bellious tribes an indemnity for losses sustained by British traders, and, it was eventually arranged, by others. At the same time, however, a loan of Rs. 60,000 Avas made to the Sultan. For the protection of our interests against similar risks in the future, three alternative courses were subse quently suggested by the local authorities, viz., (1) annexation; (2) a protectorate; and (3) an intimation to the leading Sheikhs that Maskat and Mattrah must not be attacked. The first two courses were held to be barred by the Anglo-Prench Declaration of 1862, the abrogation of which it was not considered opportune to propose to the French Government. The third course was approved by Her Majesty's Government. It is probable that the attitude of the Government of India on the occasion of the rebellion in 1895 may have had something to do with a change in the disposition of Saiyid Faisul, to which attention was drawn by Major Hayes Sadler early in 1896; but another influence also was at work, which has since that time caused much trouble. In the year 1881 the French Government had availed themselves of their right to appoint Consuls (secured to them by their Treaty with Muscat of the 17th November 1814) to the extent of appointing a Consular A^ent at Muscat; but in 1894 they established a Vice-Consulate, and transferred M. Ottavi from Zanzibar to fill the new post. In 1S93 there had arrived in Muscat a certain Arab named Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad, Buwaihi, a native of Semail in Oman, who had been confidential secretary to Sultan Seyyid Ali of Zanzibar and had been deported by Seyyid Ali's successor, Seyyid Hamid, for anti-British intrigue. This man was taken into Saiyid Faisul's service as munshi; and, on the arrival of M. Ottavi, whom lie had known in Zanzibar, he was permitted by the Sultan also to enter the service of the French Vice-Consulate. Another sign of the increased interest taken by the French Government in Muscat affairs, was the visit of a French gunboat on the occasion of the rebellion, though it did not actually interfere. ♦This engagement was regarded as a Secret engagement until early in 1899, when Lord Salisbury mentioned its purport to M. Cambon (1781/99).3 1896. —In 1890 on the occasion of the Dhofai' rebellion, when it was proposed to send a ship-of-war to assist the Sultan, Her Majesty's H.C. 273/96. Government found it necessary to give to the French Government an assurance ' that the action which it is proposed to take implies no intention on the part of Her Majesty's Government of establishing any Protectorate ' over Muscat' (27th March 1890). The effect upon the Sultan of French activity began soon to be felt. At ludia Letter, the commencement of the troubles in Dhofar, in his anxiety to restore his 123, and authority, he was ready to accept our advice and assistance. Suddenly. ,. s however, he changed his mind ; and Major Hayes Sadler reported that the Letter. Sultan's replies to the British Consul's communications were drafted by dated 30th Abdul Aziz, through whom, there was good reason to believe, the correspon- June 189G - dence had been shown to M. Ottavi. At the same time intrigues, in which H.C. 660/96. the Sultan was said to be concerned, were reported to be taking place between M. Ottavi and certain of the Trucial Chiefs of the Pirate Coast. The question 590/96. of a British Protectorate was, in consequence, again raised by the India Office in a letter to the Foreign Office of the 1st July, but the reply (dated 9th July) still was to the effect that ' present conditions are very far from favourable to the prospect of' an 'arrangement with France by which an exclusive British Protectorate should be established over Oman.' Notwithstanding the unfriendly attitude assumed in the early part of the year by the Sultan, when, in December 1896, he showed signs of a desire to take action against the Dhofar rebels, the Government of India again offered g ecret their assistance and advice, Her Majesty's Government having previously Despatch, instructed them to endeavour to maintain influence over, and amicable No. 38, relations with, the Sultan. An offer of further financial assistance was also ^ at&lt; j (l | made to him, provided he would manifest confidence in British goodwill. ' ti) 1897. —In the middle of January the Sultan became more favourably Pol.200/97. disposed, and he asked for the assistance of a British ship of war for the reduction of the Dhofar rebellion. This request was complied with, subject 1728/97. to conditions, imposed by the Foreign Office in order to meet French susceptibilities, that she should help only with her guns and not land any force, and that nothing should be done which would imply encroachment on 848/97. the independence of the Sultan ; moreover, a further sum of lis. 60,000 was subsequently lent by ( the Government of India towards extricating Saiyid Faisul from his embarrassments. It may be mentioned that immediately after this arrangement had been made a French gunboat arrived at Muscat, and her services were understood to have been offered to the Sultan and declined by him. Finally the mere presence of H.M.S. 'Cossack ' at Dhofar 398/97. proved sufficient to secure a bloodless victory for the Sultan, who was cordial in his acknowledgments. This temporary (as it proved) change in Saiyid 583/97. Faisul's attitude was probably due to the influence of the AVazir, Seyyid Saeed, whose sympathies were in favour of the British Government. In May 1897 he had (at the instance of the British Consul) induced the Sultan to protest against the French claim to jurisdiction over Suri dhows flying the French flag. It may be convenient here to state briefly the modus operandi of the Enclosure 2 French authorities in this matter, as described by Captain Cox. The captain of a dhow, whether he be owner or not, presents himself at a French ^ ^ Consulate or to the authorities in a French possession, e.g., Obokh, Jibuti, dated Madagascar, Zanzibar or the Comoro Islands, even in some instances 26th July at Muscat. He applies for a French flag, and is told that he must qualify li)o;) ' either by acquiring a house or laud in a French possession, or else by producing security in the person either of a French protected resident or of an Arab in possession of a French flag. The latter is the alternative usually adopted. When the flag and tit re de navigation have been granted, the dhow enjoys immunity from being overhauled by British cmisers* ; and in the case of anything happening to her, the French authorities claim to protect the captain, if he produces his titre de navigation, whether he is the owner or not. * On the other hand, the Law Officers of the Crown are of opinion that in territorial waters the vessels maybe searched and proceeded against for slave trading; and that, if the French Gcve.-mnent fail to stop the abuse of their protection, the vessels may be treated even on the high teas as not entitled to the protection of the French flag. (248S/98.)4 Secret This practice had been a subject of complaint by the Indian Government Xo 5P 44 Ch ' ever s ^ rlce 1891, when the French Government made a promise to discontinue dated 4th ^ ut on b r » as tlie y subsequently (16th October 1897) explained, so far as their Dec. 1891. Consulate at Aden was concerned. The ground of complaint was, primarily, that it threw grave difficulties in the way of carrying out the Act of the Brussels Conference in regard to the Slave Trade. Though discontinued at Aden, ^ '' the practice was reported in 1892 to continue at Madagascar (India Letter dated 24th Ko. 46), at Obokh (Nos. 66 and 98), and (No. 231 of 1892) it was stated that Nov. 1890, its discontinuance would be even more effectual than systematic cruising in Lnc. 4. stopping the slave trade. Pol. 803/97. I n 1^3, it was proposed that the Sultnn of Muscat should be invited to subscribe to Chapter TV. of the Act of the Brussels Conference; hut the proposal was not carried out, partly because it was at the time understood that the Act was not to apply to the Persian Gulf, and partly for fear of em- iv- ntch barrassment with the French. In 1894 the Government of India instructed to lndia the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to advise the Sultan to inform No. 48, the French Vine-Consul that the assertion of French protection over Suri dated 19th boats in Oman waters would be a contravention of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862. Her Majesty's Government approved these Secret instructions. In September 1896 the question was brought prominently Despatch, forward owing to the seizure by H.M.S. 'Sphinx' of two dhows flying ^ French colours, which were found to be full of slaves. They were handed Vpril 1897 over ^ ie ^ renc ^ Consul at Muscat for adjudication; and a repre sentation was made to the French Government, who, while stating that Pol. 1815/97. these cases would be dealt with, denied that they had ever had any intention No ii' of di scon ti Q uing the grant of French papers to Suri dhows. The Government 1897. of India thereupon revived the suggestion that the Sultan should adhere to the Act of the Brussels Conference ; but the Foreign Office preferred a pro- No ^'5 ia ' posal that the Sultan should be advised to institute a distinctive flag for the 1 0 use of vessels belonging to his subjects. 1898. —On the 1st January 1898 an incident occurred which seemed to show that the Sultan w r as again assuming an unfriendly attitude. He declined to hoist the British flag as usual on that day, at the instance, it was said, of the French Vice-Consul, in order to show his independence of the Govern ment of India. (The Resident, who was present, had, however, no difficulty in inducing him to apologise, and the flag was hoisted with a salute on the 3rd January.) He agreed without difficulty to issuing a j^'oclamation with regard to the arms traffic; but he was obstructive in the matter of adjudi cating on the arms seized in the' Baluchistan.' His attitude in this matter 1747/98. also was attributed to French intrigues. Again a proposal was made to him that he should appoint a British officer to control his customs, with a view to remedy grievances under which British Indian traders were suffering. Nothing, however, was done, nor were any steps taken by him to remedy the grievances. isy/ 9 0f ^ arc ^ 1 ^ Ie Government of India reported on the proposal to induce the Sultan to institute a distinctive flag for his subjects to the effect thar, Pol. 460/08. 'so long as facilities for obtaining French flags and papers exist, no ' distinctive flag can successfully be introduced by the Sultan among his ' subjects at Sur.'' A strong representation was then made by the India 2488/98. Office to the Foreign Office with a view to Her Majesty's Government taking up the question with the French Government (23rd May 1898). This the Foreign Office eventually (20th December 1898) declined to do, on the ground that Her Majesty's Government had no locus standi, as ' Muscat is not a British Protectorate,' and Her Majesty's Government had ' received No. 48 of no request from the Sultan to do so.' The Government of India were then 1898. instructed to revert to the proposed prescription of a distinctive flag. Meanwhile, in October, the French gunboat ' Scorpion ' visited Muscat, 1022/98. bringing presents for the Sultan, who took the opportunity to make a great 1140/98. demonstration in honour of the French. Coincidently with this visit an outbreak occurred at Sur, but it was not of a serious nature and subsided before the end of the year. About the same time, the Sultan dismissed his VTazir, Scyyid Saeed, to whom reference has already been made. This step was, it was believed, taken at the instigationof M. Ottavi, ■who resented the action of the TTazir in May 1897; and it left 2490/98. the Sultan practically in the hands of the French, acting through Abdul Aziz. In November Colonel Meade recommended that he should be empowered to insist upon the Sultan dismissing Abdul Aziz ; but before orders could be given on this proposal it was reported in a French newspaper (' Journal des Debats' of 20th November 1898) that a French man-of-war had established a coaling station at Bender Gissah in the Gulf of Oman. It subsequently transpired that the Sultan had consented to this arrangement in March 1898. This was regarded by the Government of India as a breach of the engagement entered into by Saiyid Faisul in 1891 ; and Tier Majesty's Government, with a caveat as to observance of the Declaration of 1862, approved any measures which the Government of India might think 1162/98. likely to be effective, provided they should not require French concurrence. (Tel. 3rd January 1899.) 1899. —In January M.' Ottavi was specially promoted by the French 5(54/99. Government to the rank of Consul. On the 19th January the Viceroy reported (1) that the Sultan had admitted that lie had promised the French a place for storing coal, but ^ denied that the locality was settled ; (2) that, there being no doubt Bander Gisseh was the place, H.M.S. ' Sphinx ' had landed a boat's crew there, with instructions to hoist the British flag if a French man-of-war appeared in the harbour; (3) that he proposed to withhold payment of the Muscat subsidy. These proceedings were approved, subjeut to the proviso that hoisting the British flag did not mean appropriation of territory, but merely prevention of an infringement of the Sultan's Agreement of 1891. The neces sity for hoisting the flag did noc arise; but on the 25th January the Government 180/99. of India were authorised to instruct Colonel Meade on the occasion of his approaching visit to Muscat to present an ultimatum to the Snltan. This document was to demand from the Sultan a revocation of his agreement with 238/99. the French regarding Bunder Gisseh, the dismissal of Abdul Aziz from his em ployment by the Saltan (but not his deportation), the cessation of unauthorised taxes on British trade, and payment of interest on the overdue indemnity for the losses incurred by British subjects in 1895. The Sultan Avas also to be advised to order his subjects to use a distinctive flag. The ultimatum was presented to the Sultan by Colonel Meade on the 9th February with a demand for a reply within 48 hours. His Highness procrastinated ; but on 345/99. the Idth February Admiral Douglas arrived in his flagship, having been authorised to enforce Colonel Meade's demand, if necessary, provided that there must be no personal collision with the French. The Sultan was summoned to attend on board II.M.S. 'Eclipse' oh the 15th, and after some hesitation decided to obey. Ue had previously sent to Colonel Meade a notification revoking his gift to the French Government; but he now consented to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Govern ment and to comply fully with all their demands. It may be mentioned that the demands actually made upon the Sultan differed in two respects from those which had received the previous sanction of the Government of India (1) Colonel Meade insisted upon a public announcement of the cancellation of the French agreement. His acting in this respect without 345/99. instructions was not approved by Her Majesty's Government; (2) He insisted not only on the dismissal of Abdul Aziz by the Saltan, but on His Highness promising no longer to receive that individual. Colonel Meade had proposed to add another condition, viz., that the Sultan should agree not to receive representatives of other Powers. This was understood to 190/99. mean Powers which had no treaty rights and to refer to a rumoured intention on the part of llussia to establish a consulate at Muscat; but he was instructed that, under the Declaration of 18f32, we had no right to require the Sultan not to receive representatives of other Powers. On the 251/99. 18th February Colonel Meade reported that the Sultan had fully complied with the demands made upon him, including cancellation of the French agreement, prescription to his subjects of the exclusive use of a distinctive flag, and an intimation to the French Consul that he would not receive Abdul Aziz as French Agent. Colonel Meade was authorised to assure the Sultan of our 251/99. S. 13. B6 Pol. 923/00. 331/90. .'564/90. 660/09. 714/99. 732, 80o, 998 of 1609. 489/1000. 1096, 2081, 2392 of 1890. 2331/99. 2466/99. No. 47 of 1899. Pol. 2398/99, effective support, if necessary, provided he should continue to follow our advice, but not to hoist the British flag for that purpose. [The revocation, under pressure from the British Government, of the Bunder Gisseh concession by the Sultan led to a lon^ diplomatic negotiation with th« French Government, which was not finally settled until August 1000, when an airan^ement was arrived at, under which the coal depot at Makalla Cove, which had since 1875 been used by the British Government, was divided into two approximately equal parts, one of which was aecepted by the French.] On the 1st March the Viceroy reported that the attitude of the Sultan was again becoming unfriendly, and that he continued to receive clandestine visits from Abdul Aziz, who was endeavouring to cause trouble with the Sharki- yeh tribes. The question or our position at Muscat, under the Declaration of 1862 and the Sultan's engagement of 1891, was therefore submitted for the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown. Their opinion was to the effect that (U the Declaration of 1862 does not require the British Government to abstain from exercising a preponderating influence, so long as that influence is not exerted in any way infconsistent with the independence of Muscat; (2) that the British Government would not be precluded from punishing or even deposing any individual Sultan for breaches of engagements, provided the independence of his successor were recognised ; (3) that whilst the question whether the Sultan could be required to dismiss a particular adviser must depend on the special circumstances of ihe case, it would hardly be compatible with the independence of Muscat to compel the Sultan to accept ministers and advisers who are acceptable to the British Government. It was, however, decided merely to continue to withhold the subsidy. Towards the middle of the month the Sultan became more amenable, but the Government of India preferred to make no further formal demands upon him for the time, although the Customs question and that of the payment of interest on the indemnity remained unsettled, and the maintenance in the office of Wazir of Saivid Muhammad bin Azzar, who was a creature of the French Consul, caused embarrassment. Before, however, instructions to this effect (dated 25th May) reached him. Colonel Meade had already pressed the Sultan to apply for the loan of a British official to manage his Customs (23rd April) and had received from the Sultan a refusal (9th May). His Highness also continued to evade every attempt made by Major Fagan to induce him to undertake to pay due regard to the advice of the British representative. Trouble began to arise in May with the tribes, owing to the Sultan's inability to pay them the usual cash presents; and a project w r as formed by them to dethrone Saiyid Faisul. This, however, came to nothing. Mean while the Sultan declined to take any practical steps for enforcing the adoption by his subjects of a distinctive flag. He appeared to dislike the idea, though he objected strongly to the French claims to jurisdiction over his subjects, and he professed to think that the French Government were likely to remedy the existing state of things. In June the French Government complained that the Political Agent at Muscat had endeavoured to persuade the Sultan to order the discontinuance by his subjects of the use of the French flag, and had offered a British ship of war to enforce compliance. This was denied by the rolitical Agent, and the matter eventually dropped. In August the French Government, in reply to a note by the Charge d'Affaires at Paris, repeated their declaration (made 16th October 1897) that their undertaking in 1891 to discontinue the issue of their flag to Arab vessels, referred only to their Consulate at Aden; but they admitted that in some cases the flag had been granted without sufficient examination, and stated that thev proposed to revise the regulations governing the practice. In November the Secretary of State, with Lord Salisbury's concurrence, forwarded the correspondence to the Government of India, and suggested for consideration three possible courses which that Government might adopt, viz., to induce the Sultan (I) to insist upon all vessels belonging to his subjects being registered and flying his distinctive flag; or (2) to declare that, alter a specified date, he would not recognise in his territory any protection or naturalisation thereafter conferred on his subjects otherwise than with his7 sanction or under treaty. He referred also to a suggestion (3) that an extended issue of the 33ritish flag might be practised, but indicated that difficulties would arise from the provisions of the existing law. In an earlier Despatch (No. 37 of the 11th August) the Secretary of State 660/99. referred to the question of the subsidy, and suggested, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, that an early resumption of payment of the subsidy would be likely to make for the re-establishment of a good understanding with the Sultan. On the SOth September Captain Cox^ who had been specially selected for the appointment of Political Agent, arrived at Muscat. He at first abstained from broaching important questions, and confined himself to endeavouring to obtain the Sultan's confidence. In this he met with considerable success; and the Government of India felt justified in autho- 998/99. rising (13th December) the resumption of payment of the subsidy, with effect from October, the question of the arrears being left in abeyance. The outcome of this step was that the Sultan felt himself to be in a position to assume the direct control of his Customs, which had previously been farmed out to contractors. This was regarded by the local authorities as a step in the direction ot meeting the wishes of the Government of India in this 212/1901. respect, and the first year's working of the new arrangement proved to be very satisfactory. In November a certain Frenchman, M. Goguyer, who had arrived at 033,949, Muscat earlier in the year and proceeded thence to Bahrein, returned to Muscat and had an audience with the Sultan. He was evidently in close 330'357^ relations with M. Ottavi, but his actual business was mysterious. It 456' 1200 subsequentlv transpired that he was contributing Anglophobe letters to the of 1900 Prench newspaper ' La Depeche Coloniale,' and also endeavouring to 1017/1900. •promote the introduction of French trade goods into Muscat. [A suggestion 1901. that the Sultan should take certain steps to put a stop to M. Goguyer's inter ference in Muscat affairs was referred to the Foreign Office on the 10th May 1901; but action of this kind on the part of the Sultan was considered inadvisable, at all events until the Foreign Office had ascertained whether or 1993/1901. not he was an official of the French Government ] 1900. —The Sultan's behaviour during this year continued to be friendly. He co-operated with Captain Cox in carrying out the arrangement with the 1137/1900. French regarding the coaling station in Makalla Cove; he reinstated Seyyid Saeed as Vizier ; he requested that certain scurrilous leaflets containing false 573/1900. information and malicious comments on British policy, which were being disseminated in Muscat, should be suppressed in the post office ; and, further (as reported by the Viceroy in his telegram of the 22nd May), he offered to sign a letter requesting Her Majesty's Government to discuss the flag 543 /1900. question with Hie French Government on his behalf. The Foreign Office were indisposed to do more than to offer friendly representations to the 2152/1900. French Government, which, moreover, they did not expect to be oi much practical use. But, before orders were issued, the Saltan visited Sur, in the 639/1900. second week of June, in H .M .S. ' Sphinx,' and obtained from three dhow owners the French papers which they held, and from the remainder ot' the Suri French-protected dhow owners, a solemn undertaking to return their flags and papers to the French authorities on the occasion of their next visit to their port of registry. On his return to Muscat, the Sultan sent the three sets of papers which had been surrendered to him, to M. Ottavi, who, however, refused to accept them. He also issued an edict to the following effect:—'We have 684/1900. ' observed that subjects of ours have ignorantly taken flags and articles from ' a Foreign Government, whereunder they pretend to claim their protection. ' This has taken place in the past, but there must be none of it in the future ' and you must understand that such procedure is contrary to the duties and ' obligations of subjects (to their sovereign). You are hereby informed that we ' do not recognise in our territories (/.&lt;?., in the hands of our subjects) such ' flags and protection papers, and will not pardon anyone who takes them ' otherwise than with our written permission and sanction in accordance 2245/1900. ' with the terms of the treaties between us and Foreign Powers. Let this be clear to all.' This edict he communicated to the Consuls on the 15th June; and it was approved by Her Majesty's Government on the clear understanding that it referred only to cases of the issue of flags subsequent to the date of its notification to Foreign Consuls. s&gt;. 13. ' CMeanwhile the Freneh Government had taken exception to the Sultan's action in this matter, of which they had received an account which differed from Pol. that furnished to Her Majesty's Government by the British Consul. On the 2195/1900. 25th Jui:c, M. Camhon stated to Lord Salisbury that the dispute was one between the Sultan and the French Government, who would have to insist upon restitution of the papers, and, if necessary, an apology. He subsequently (-6th June) requested Her Majesty s Government to instruct their A^ent toadwse the Sultan to comply. Lord Salisbury declined to commit himself in the absence of full information, and pressed the invalidity of the French claim to grant their protection to the subjects of another Power. M. Cambon stated that the practice would be discontinued for the future, and that existing papers would be examined. Lord Salisbury promised all due respect'for French rights and susceptibilities, and suggested the removal of M. Ottavi, who had shown a partisan spirit and caused irritation. On the Oth July the India Office suggested that M. Cambon should be 684 1000. informed that Her Majesty s Government would advise the Sultan to await an examination of the French papers already issued to his subjects before repudiating them, and to arrive at no decision regarding them pending further reference to the Governments of France and Great Britain. The 2245 1900. Foreign Office (17th July) preferred not to again raise the quesiion with the French Government, who would probably decline to admit our right to take part in the examination of doubtful cases promised by M. Cambon, but they approved generally the proposed advice to the Sultan. The Viceroy was 224(/1900. instructed accordingly (20th July). On the 17th July M. Cambon announced that the French Governnjent were sending a ship partly to establish their new coal depot at Muscat, and partly to enquire into tiie question whether any dhows flying the French tlag were implicated in slave trading. On the 11th August the India Office, in forwarding further papers received from India, suggested that the ^^nd Article of the Brussels Act Pol. 780/ misjht have some 'application to the probable objection of the French Govern- 1900 ' merit to our assistance at the examination of papers; and on the 24th August and 6th September, Lord George Hamilton proposed that the 841, .58 of attention of the French Government should be drawn to certain definite 1900 ' cases of slave trading under their flag reported by Captain Cox, and to 1299/1900. admissions of irregularities under the Brussels Act by the Commander of the ' Drome/' 899/1900. Meanwhile on the 18th August, the R. F. ' Drome,' arrived at Muscat, and the French authorities at once assumed a threatening ^attitude towards the Sultan, demanding the return to Sur by the ' Drome,' of the surrendered papers, and the reception of Abdul Aziz as 1'rench intermediary. The Sultan firmly refused. In conversation with Captain Cox the Commander of the ' Drome ' stated that their demand as to return of the pnpers was in accordance with an understanding with Lord fealisbuiy, but Captain Cox rejoined that this was not in accordance with nis inioiination. On the 26th August the Viceroy reported that he had instructed Captain Cox that the Sultan's attitude seemed correct, but that His Highness should 2345/1900. not refuse to discuss doubtful or disputed cases, and in the case of disagree ment should demand a written statement of the French case. These instructions were approved by Her Majesty's Government on the 3rd September. In the meantime two of the Suris who had actually surrendered their papers to the Sultan (the receipt of which from His Highness had been , 9 , 1( refused by M. Ottavi) arrived in Muscat and personail\ returned their papeis 1032/1900. ^ M Q ttavi} who acce pt e d them. Other Suri dhows, whose owners had signed the solemn undertaking to the Sultan, were intercepted by the ' Drome ' on their way to Busrah and induced to come to Muscat flying the French flag. When appealed to by the Sultan to fulfil their promise, they pleaded that they dared not do so in the presence of the &lt;k Drome,' but would do so later.' Finally, they were furnished by the French Consul with fresh ' crew lists,' and proceeded on their voyage. On the 28th August the Sultan asked for a statement of the French claims in writing. This 1C60/1900. M. Ottavi declined to give. On the SOth the flag question was dropped, but M. Ottavi insisted on the reception ot Abdul Aziz. 1 his, also, the Sultan declined, not (Captain Cox reports) through any personal objection, but through fear of displeasing the British Government.On the 4th September, at a further interview, the French Consul definitely 1004 and informed the Sultan that, if he persisted in his refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, 1089/1900. force would ho employed to compel his acquiescence. The Sultan then told Captain Cox that if the British Government would not support him in the 9 .j r( / 19 oo. event of the French using force, he would have to give in. On the advice of Captain Cox the Sultan then wrote to M. Ottavi recapitulating his version of what had been said on the 4th Septomhcr, and elicited a confirmation by M. Ottavi in writing of his threat to use force. The Sultan theu sent the correspondence to Captain Cox, who thereupon (7th September) addressed a letter to his French colleague inyiting his attention to the Declaration of 1862, and stating that in his opinion W. Ottavi's action vyas incompatible with the independence of the Sultan, which their respective Governments had mutually agreed t^ respect. M. Ottavi replied on the 10th September to the effect that he had referred the matter to his Government, and on the 2392/1900. same day the ' Drome ' left Muscat, leaving behind her in charge of the depot an official who speaks Arabic and Swahili fluently . Captain Cox's action was approved by Her Majesty's Government, and the Government of India were instructed to express to the Sultan the appreciation of Her p ol 2459/ Majesty's Government of his desire to observe his promises and 1900. engagements. The ' Drome' returned to Muscat on the 16th September and left again 1132/1900. on the 18th without, however, any further communication being made by the French Consul to the Sultan. She finally left the Gulf towards the end of October, merely calling at Muscat and Sur, where her commander enjoined 1299/1900. on the French proteges on no account to surrender their papers. In September a further complication was reported by the Government of 929 /190?. India. A certain native of Oman named Hilal-bin-Amr, who had been deported from Zanzibar for intrigues against British influence but had been permitted to return to Zanzibar, arrived at Sur and busied himself in 2197/1897. fomenting dissatisfaction against the Sultan. The Political Ilesident was authorised to inform the Sultan that he was at liberty to expel this man, in which case he would be sent back to Zanzibar. The Foreign Office under- 1184, 2394 took to discuss with the French Government any claim to French protection ot 19 00. which might bo raised by Hilal. The Sultan took the opportunity to 1249/1000. suggest the deportation of a certain Saiyid Ali bin Ali; and the question of getting rid of Abdul Aziz was also raised by the Ilesident. Xo report 2648/1900. has yet been received of action taken in the two former cases; but the Foreign Office objected to any forcible action in the case of Abdul Aziz so long as he remained in French employ. It w r as ultimately considered inadvisable, even in the event of his consenting to leave Muscat, to press the 1820/1901. Zanzibar Sultan to receive Abdul Aziz pending the completion of certain negotiations for the surrender of French extra-territorial iurisdiction in O ^ ' Zanzibar. For the rest of the year nothing of great importance was recorded. M. 1132/1900. Ottavi by a stratagem induced the Sultan to give up the third set of French papers surrendered to him at Sur to the son of the owner, on whose appli cation they were at once renewed by the French Consul. A French Agent was also sent to Sur to watch events. The Government of India were not 1184/1900. disposed to sanction a proposal of Captain Cox that a British Agent should also be sent to Sur, nor were they willing for the present to encourage the Sultan, as suggested by Captain Cox, to issue to his subjects articles and crew-lists, printed in Arabic and English, which could be endorsed by the British Consul and so constitute a title to the good offices of British Consuls. Thev, however, renewed their recommendation that the Sultan should be 1166/1900. assured that Her Majesty's Government would discuss the flag question with the French Government. Lord Lansdowne undertook (23rd November 1900) 2o7u/i900. to remind M. Cambon of his promised investigation at a fitting opportunity. In the latter part of November the French cruiser ' Catinat ' called at 1321/1900. Muscat, and, without making any demands on the Sultan, left on the 30th, Commodore Kiesel having previously announced his intention to repeat his visit next year. At Sur, however, he is reported to have announced that the Sultan had agreed to allow the Suris to retain their French allegiance. To counteract the effect of the 'Catinat's '' visit, the Admiral on the East India 213/1901. Station was requested to show the British Hag in the Persian Gulf by as 391/1901.10 Pol. 476/ 1901. many British ships as possible. This visit had, however, to be postponed till March in the following year. 1901 .—Writing on the 3rd February, Captain Cox reported that up to date the Sultan had maintained his firm attitude upon the flag question ; 391/1901. but that in view of the limited character of the support afforded to him by His Majesty's Government, he was apprehensive of the consequences of offending the French Government, while the French Consul was endeavour ing to induce the Suris not to abide by their engagement. He further stated that no attempt had been made by the French authorities to discuss with the Sultan the title of any subject of his to fly the French flag. The Foreign Office were therefore reminded (9th April) of Lard Lansdowne's proposed communication with the French Ambassador (letter from the Foreign Office, dated 23rd November 1900), and it was suggested to them that the Sultan should again be advised to press for a statement in writing of the French claims upon him. On the 7th March a Belgian steam yacht, which was said to have been chartered by a party, the leader of which was a French Government official, arrived at Muscat, and the party was introduced by M. Ottavi to the Sultan. They were reported to intend visiting Sohar and the ports of the Pirate Coast. On the 9th March two Bussians, one of whom is reported to be a brother of Major Leonticff of Abyssinian fame, arrived, and were, after some hesitation, received by the Sultan. They subsequently applied for a written permit to import arms, which was refused as unnecessary, and eventually left for Bombay, whence they wrote a complimentary letter to the Sultan, informing him of their intention to return to Muscat after visiting Jibuti. It may be mentioned that in the beginning of April a letter was received at Muscat addressed to the ' Russian Vice-Consul.' On the 16th the ' Korniloff,' the pioneer vessel of the new Russian line to the Persian (jult, called at Muscat. She gave, and (on the advice of Admiral Bosanquet) received, a salute, as a special compliment on the occasion of her first visit. In consequence of a report Irom Captain Cox (dated ISth January) that coal of crood quality existed in the neighbourhood of Sur, the Government ot* India deputed a geological expert. Dr. von Krafft, to inspect the coal fields. He proceeded to Sur in May accompanied by Captain Cox, but found the local Arabs obstructive. The Sultan proceeded to Sur to arrange matters, and a gunboat was also ordered to proceed thither. It was suggested to the Foreign Office by the India Office (10th May) that exclusive rights over these coal fields should be secured. The Foreign Office saw no objection, provided the rights were granted by the Sultan not to the Government ol India but to a British firm. In a letter of the 3rd April Captain Cox suggested that he should be authorised to advise the Sultan to issue a further Edict, which should practically extend the terms of the Edict communicated to the Foreign Consuls on the 15th June 1900 {see p. 7), to the dhow-owners who had already at that date received French protection. The object was to bring pressure to bear on those dhow-owners to fulfil their undertaking given to 2012/01. the Sultan in June 1900. The Foreign Office, however, have expressed the opinion that the issue of the proposed Edict by the Sultan would not be judicious; and the Government of India have been instructed accordingly. The Foreign Office have been once more pressed to discuss the situation at Muscat with M. Cambon. 544/01. 1988/01. 611/01. Political and Secret Department, 7 th June 1901. C. G. C.B. 12!).

The connection between the Government of India and the Sultans of SeeAUchi- Muscat dates back to 1798, when the first agreement between Saiyid Sultan ^ &gt; r g^ tios (who was killed in 1804), and the East India Company was executed at a time y 0 ] xi., when Napoleon I. was believed to contemplate making Muscat a base for p. 3P. attacking India. Since that date material assistance has repeatedly i: been given to successive Sultans to enable them to hold their own against the piratical Arab tribes, as well as against their own rebellious subjects ; treaties of friendship and commerce,! and for the suppression of the slave trade,J have also been concluded with them on several occasions. Saiyid Sultan was succeeded by his two sons, Salim and Said, reigning jointly. Saiyid Salim died in 1821. Saiyid Said reigned till his death in 1856, when he left, amongst other issue, four Sons : Majid, Sultan of Znnzibiir. Thoweyni, Sultan of Muscat, 1856-1866. Turki, Sultan of Muscat, §1871-1888. Abdul Aziz. Salim, Sultan of Muscat, 1866-1868.§ Harib. Khalifah. Muhammad. Faisul, Sultan of Muscat, 1888. Fnhad. Taimar. Nadir. Since his death the Government of India has. on several occasions, assumed the role of protecting power, and no Sultan lias been able to establish his authority since that date without obtaining the recognition of the British Government. It was by the arbitration of Lord Canning that the dispute between Sultan Said's sons as to the independence of Zanzibar was settled in 1861; and when, on the death of Saiyid Thoweyni of Muscat in 1866, Saiyid Majid of Zanzibar refused to continue to Saiyid Salim and his successor the subsidy awarded by Lord Canning, the Government of India (though they never formally relieved Zanzibar of the liability) undertook, in 1873, to be responsible for the sum (40,000 crowns), subject to the observance by the 11 Sultan of Muscat of his treaty engagements, and of a friendly attitude towards Great Britain. As regards other Powers, the United States of America concluded a commercial treaty with Muscat in 1833, France in 1844, and llolland, through the instrumentality of the British Hesident, in 1877. These treaties, as well as our own, all provide for ' most-favoured-nation ' treatment. In 1862, in consequence of Lord Canning's award, it was considered to be necessary that France, having a treaty with Muscat, should consent to recognise the separate independence of Muscat and Zanzibar. The immediate cause which induced Iler Majesty's Government' to become a party to the Joint Declaration which was signed between Great Britain and France on the 10th March 1862, appears to have been an apprehension of French aggression in Zanzibar. The declaration, however, in accordance with the view of both E.f* in 1809, 1810, 1874, 1877, 1883, 1S!&gt;5, and 1897. f In 1800, 1839, 1865, and 1891. + In 1822, 1845, and 1873. § In the interval between the deposition of Saiyid Salim and the accession of Saiyid Turki the throne of Oman was usurped by Azau bin Kais, Chief of Ilostak and brother-in-law of Saiyid Salim. He was killed in battle in 18/1. 11 There has been some doubt as to whether this undertaking was personal to Saiyid Turki; but the India Oifice held that it was not—and, as a matter of fact, the subsidy was continued to his successor. See Enclosures to Political Despatch, No. 6, dated 31st January 1889. S. 13. A Enclosure 1 in Foreign Letter from India, No. 63, dated 2nd June 1890. Pol. 344/99. Pol. 1717/99.I Governments, engaged ' reciprocally to respect the independence of ' the H .C. 925/90. Sovereigns both of Muscat and of Zanzibar. This declaration, so far as Zanzibar is concerned, was abrogated in 1890; but, so far as Muscat is concerned, remains still in force. India Letter, The present ruler of Muscat, Saiyid Eaisul, was recognised by the Govern- No. 03,dated men ^ India in 1890, and the subsidy was continued to him. He at that 1890 nnC time gave most satisfactory assurances that he would be bound by his father's engagements, and be guided by the advice of the British Government, whose huha LeUer. approbation he desired to secure. In the following year he executed a new 2nd June 1 ' commercial treaty with Great Britain, and gave a formal undertaking ' never 1891. ' to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, save to the - ' British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman, or any of their 6171611 , of 1891. 'dependencies. * The position which Great Britain had thus acquired in Muscat in 1891 India Letter, was part of a larger policy which had for its object a predominance along No. 57, the whole of the Arab coast from Aden to Bahrein; and, in pursuance ^iTu^ln- ^ P ro tectorate engagements had been entered into with the coast 1890. tribes from Bab-el-Mandeb to Ras Sair, viz., the Subaihi, Akrabi, Fadthli, Aulaki, Wahidi, Dhuyaibi, 'Irka, Kaieti and Mahri, up to the boundary of Secret Dhoi'ar, which latter had been an integral part of Muscat dominions since Despatch, 1879. In 1890 the Government of India had proposed to assert a virtual No. 2i), dated p ro tectorate over Muscat, of which at least five-sixths of the trade was in the 1890 )Ct hands of British subjects, but the Declaration of 1862 was considered to stand in the way. Secret 1895.—Early in 1895 a rebellion, which promised at first to be successful, No 1 129 broke out in Oman, probably in the interests of the Sultan of Zanzibar, dated 2nd The Government of India sent a ship of war to protect British subjects, but, June 1895. iu accordance with the lines of policy which had been indicated by Lord Kimberley in his Despatch, No. 25, of the 31st March 188(3, an attitude of the strictest neutrality towards the rival parties was adopted ; and, when the revolt finally collapsed, they insisted upon the Sultan levying from the re bellious tribes an indemnity for losses sustained by British traders, and, it was eventually arranged, by others. At the same time, however, a loan of Rs. C0,000 was made to the Sultan. For the protection of our interests against similar risks in the future, three alternative courses were subse quently suggested by the local authorities, viz., (1) annexation; (2) a H.C. 836/95. protectorate; and (3) an intimation to the leading Sheikhs that Maskat and To India, Mattrah must not be attacked. The first two courses were held to be barred Secref'dated ^7 the Anglo-Erench Declaration of 1862, the abrogation of which it was not 30th Aiiu' 1 . considered opportune to propose to the .French Government. The third 1895. ^ course was approved by Her Majesty's Government. It is probable that the attitude of the Government of India on the occasion of the rebellion iu 1895 may have had something to do with a change in the H.C. 660/96. disposition of Saiyid Faisul, to which attention was drawn by Major Hayes Sadler early in 1896; but another influence also was at work, which has since that time caused much trouble. Aitchison, In the year 1881 the French Government had availed themselves Vol. XL, 0 £ their right to appoint Consuls (secured to them by their Treaty with p ' 43 Muscat of the 17th November 1844) to the extent of appointing a Consular Secret Agent at Muscat; but in 1894 they established a Vice-Consulate, and Despatch transferred M. Ottavi from Zanzibar to fill the new post. In 1893 there had to India, arrived in Muscat a certain Aral) named Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad, dated9th Ruwaihi, a native of Semail in Oman, who had been confidential secretary Oct. 1894. to Sultan Seyyid Ali of Zanzibar and had been depoited by Seyyid Ali's successor, Seyyid Hamid, for anti-British intrigue. This man was taken 306, 357/99. Saiyid Faisul's service as munshi; and, on the arrival of M. Ottavi, whom he had known in Zanzibar, he was permitted by the Sultan also to enter the service of the French Vice-Consulate. Another sign of the increased interest taken by the French Government in Muscat affairs, was the visit of a French gunboat on the occasion of the rebellion, though it did not actually interfere. •This engagement was regarded as a Secret engagement until early in 1899, when Lord Salisbury mentioned its purport to M. Cambon (1781/99).1896 .—In 1890 on the occasion of the Dhofar rebellion, when it was proposed to send a ship-of-war to assist the Sultan, Her Majesty's H.C. 273/96. Government found it necessary to give to the French Government an assurance ' that the action which it is proposed to take implies no intention ' on the part of Her Majesty's Government of establishing any Protectorate ' over Muscat' (27th March 1896). The ellect upon the Sultan of French activity began soon to be felt, xlt India Letter, the commencement of the troubles in Dhofar, in Ins anxiety to restore his 123, and authority, he was ready to accept our advice and assistance. Suddenly. &gt; s however, he changed his mind ; and Major Hayes Sadler reported that the Letter Sultan's replies to the British Consul's communications were drafted by dated 30th Abdul Aziz, through whom, there was good reason to believe, the correspon- June 189G - dence had been shown to M. Ottavi. At the same time intrigues, in which h.C. 060/96. the Sultan was said to be concerned, were reported to be taking place between M. Ottavi and certain of the Trucial Chiefs of the Pirate Coast. The question 590/96. of a British Protectorate was, in consequence, again raised by the India Office in a letter to the Foreign Office of the 1st July, but the reply (dated 9th July) still was to the effect that ' present conditions are very far from favourable to the prospect of ' an ' arrangement with France by which an exclusive British Protectorate should be established over Oman.' Notwithstanding the unfriendly attitude assumed in the early part of the year by the Sultan, when, in December 1896, he showed signs of a desire to take action against the Dhofar rebels, the Government of India again offered g ecret their assistance and advice, Her Majesty's Government having previously Despatch, instructed them to endeavour to maintain influence over, and amicable No. 38, relations with, the Sultan. An offer of further financial assistance was also made to him, provided he would manifest confidence in British goodwill. ' ep ' 1897.—In the middle of January the Sultan became more favourably Pol. 200/97. disposed, and he asked for the assistance of a British ship of war for the reduction of the Dhofar rebellion. This request was complied with, subject 1728/97. to conditions, imposed by the Foreign Office in order to meet French susceptibilities, that she should help only with her guns and not land any force, and that nothing should be done which would imply encroachment on 8+8/97. the independence of the Sultan ; moreover, a further sum of Bs. 60,000 was subsequently lent by] the Government of India towards extricating Saiyid Faisul from his embarrassments. It may be mentioned that immediately after this arrangement had been made a French gunboat arrived at Muscat, and her services were understood to have been offered to the Sultan and declined by him. Finally the mere presence of H.M.S. ' Cossack ' at Dhofar 398/97. proved sufficient to secure a bloodless victory for the Sultan, who was cordial in his acknowledgments. This temporary (as it proved) change in Saiyid 583/97. Faisul's attitude was probably due to the influence of the Wazir, Seyyid Saeed, whose sympathies were in favour of the British Government. In May 1897 he had (at the instance of the British Consul) induced the Sultan to protest against the French claim to jurisdiction over Suri dhows flying the French flag. It may be convenient here to state briefly the modus operandi of the Enclosure 2 French authorities in this matter, as described by Captain Cox. The captain of a dhow, whether he be owner or not, presents himself at a French ^ ( ^ 2 Consulate or to the authorities in a French possession, e.g., Obokh, Jibuti, dated Madagascar, Zanzibar or the Comoro Islands, even in some instances 2Gth July at Muscat. He applies for a French flag, and is told that he must qualify either by acquiring a house or land in a French possession, or else by producing security in the person either of a French protected resident or of an Arab in possession of a French flag. The latter is the alternative usually adopted. When the flag and titre de navigation have been granted, the dhow enjoys immunity from being overhauled by British cruisers* ; and in the case of anything happening to her, the French authorities claim to protect the captain, if he produces his titre de navigation, whether he is the owner or not. * On the other hand, the Law Officers of the Crown are of opinion that in territorial waters tlie vessels rnay he sesirched and proceeded against for slave trading; and that, if the French Gcve.-iiment fail to stop the abuse of their protection, the vessels may be treated even on the high ters as not entitled to (he protection of the French flag. (248S/&amp;8.)4 Secret This practice bad been a subject of complaint by the Indian Government Despatch, ever s i nce 1S91, when the French Government made a promise to discontinue (htcMMth on ^y» as they subsequently (16tli October 1897) explained, so far as their Dec. J891. Consulate at Aden was concerned. The ground of complaint was, primarily, that it threw grave difficulties in the way of carrying out the Act of the Brussels DeTia* I Conference in regard to the Slave Trade. Though discontinued at Aden, No 47 '' the practice was reported in 1892 to continue at Madagascar (India Letter dated 24th Ko. 46), at Obokh (Nos. 66 and 98), and (No. 231 of 1892) it was stated that Nov. 1899, its discontinuance would be even more effectual than systematic cruising in Lnc. 4. stopping the slave trade. Pol. 803/97. it was proposed that the Sultan of Muscat should bo invited to subscribe to Chapter IV. of the Act of the Brussels Conference; but the proposal was not carried out, partly because it was at the time understood that the Act was not to apply to the Persian Gulf, and partly for fear of em- Secret barrassment with the French. In 1894 the Government of India instructed l/OSDll tell # # # to India the Political Resident in the Persian Gnlf to advise the Sultan to inform No. 48, the French Vice-Consul that the assertion of French protection over Suri dated 19th boats in Oman waters would be a contravention of the Anglo-French Oct. 1894. Declaration of 1862. Her Majesty's Government approved these Secret instructions. In September 1896 the question was brought prominently Despatch, forward owing to the seizure by H.M.S. 'Sphinx' of two dhows flying No. 12, French colours, which were found to be full of slaves. They were handed i^ril 189' over t 0 the French Consul at Muscat for adjudication; and a repre- * ' sentation was made to the French Government, who, while stating that Pol. 1815/97. these cases would be dealt with, denied that they had ever had any intention No n'' of of discontinuing the grant of French papers to Suri dhows. The Government 1897. ' India thereupon revived the suggestion that the Sultan should adhere to the Act of the Brussels Conference ; but the Foreign Oilice preferred a pro- To India, posal that the Sultan should be advised to institute a distinctive flag for the NoyU* of use 0 j ! yegggls belonging to his subjects. 1898 .—On the 1st January 1898 an incident occurred which seemed to show that the Sultan was again assuming an unfriendly attitude. He declined to hoist the British flag as usual on that day, at the instance, it was said, of the French Vice-Consul, in order to show his independence of the Govern ment of India. (The Resident, who was present, had, however, no diificulty in inducing him to apologise, and the flag was hoisted with a salute on the 3rd January.) He agreed without difficulty to issuing a proclamation with regard to the arms traffic; but he was obstructive in the matter of adjudi cating on the arms seized in the ' Baluchistan.' His attitude in this matter 1747/98. also was attributed to French intrigues. Again a proposal was made to him that he should appoint a British officer to control his customs, with a view to remedy grievances under which British Indian traders were suffering. Nothing, however, was done, nor were any steps taken by him to remedy the grievances. No. 59 of j n March the Government of India reported on the proposal to induce the Sultan to institute a distinctive flag for his subjects to the effect that, Pol. 460/98. &lt;e so long as facilities for obtaining French flags and papers exist, no ' distinctive flag can successfully be introduced by the Sultan among his ' subjects at Sur.' A strong representation was then made by the India 2488/98. Office to the Foreign Office with a view to Her Majesty's Government taking up the question with the French Government (23rd May 1898). This the Foreign Office eventually (20th December 1898) declined to do, on the ground that Her Majesty's Government had no locus standi, as 'Muscat is not a British Protectorate,' and Her Majesty's Government had ' received No. 48 of no request from the Sultan to do so.' The Government of India were then 1898. instructed to revert to the proposed prescription of a distinctive flag. Meanwhile, in October, the French gunboat ' Scorpion ' visited Muscat, 1022/98. bringing presents for the Sultan, who took the opportunity to make a great 1145/98. demonstration in honour of the French. Coincidentlv with this visit an outbreak occurred at Sur, but it was not of a serious nature and subsided before the end of the year. About the same time, the Sultan dismissed his Wazir, Seyyid Saeed, to whom reference has already been made. This step was, it was believed, taken at the instigationof M. Ottavi, who resented the action of the 'VVazir in May 1897; and it left 2490/98, the Sultan practically in the hands of the French, acting through Abdul Aziz. In November Colonel Meade recommended that he should be empowered to insist upon the Sultan dismissing Abdul Aziz; but before orders could be given on this proposal it was reported in a French newspaper (' Journal des Debats' of 20th November 1898) that a French man-of-war had established a coaling station at Bender Gissah in the Gulf of Oman. It subsequently transpired that the Sultan had consented to this arrangement in March 1898. This was regarded by the Government of India as a breach of the engagement entered into by Saiyid Faisul in 1891; and Her Majesty's Government, with a caveat as to observance of the Declaration of 1862, approved any measures which the Government of India might think 1162/98. likely to be effective, provided they should not require French concurrence. (Tel. 3rd January 1899.) 1899 .—In January M.' Ottavi was specially promoted by the French .564/99. Government to the rank of Consul. On the 19th January the Viceroy reported (1) that the Saltan had admitted that he had promised the French a place for storing coal, but lo8 denied that the locality was settled; (2) that, there being no doubt Bunder Gisseh was the place, H.M.S. ' Sphinx ' had landed a boat's crew there, with instructions to hoist the British flag if a French man-of-war appeared in the harbour; (3) that he proposed to withhold payment of the Muscat subsidy. These proceedings were approved, subject to the proviso that hoisting the British flag did not mean appropriation of territory, but merely prevention of an infringement of the Sultan's Agreement of 1891. The neces sity for hoisting the flag did not arise; but on the 25th January the Government iyo/99. of India were authorised to instruct Colonel Meade on the occasion of his approaching visit to Muscat to present an ultimatum to the Sultan. This document was to demand from the Sultan a revocation of his agreement with 238/99. the French regarding Bunder Gisseh, the dismissal of Abdul Aziz from his em ployment by the Sultan (but not his deportation), the cessation of unauthorised taxes on British trade, and payment of interest on the overdue indemnity for the losses incurred by British subjects in 1895. The Sultan was also to be advised to order his subjects to use a distinctive flag. The ultimatum was presented to the Sultan by Colonel Meade on the 9th February with a demand for a reply within 48 hours. His Highness procrastinated ; but on 345/99. the 14th February Admiral Douglas arrived in his flagship, having been authorised to enforce Colonel Meade's demand, if necessary, provided that there must be no personal collision with the French. The Sultan was summoned to attend on board H.M.S. 'Eclipse' on the 15th, and after some hesitation decided to obey. He had previously sent to Colonel Meade a notification revoking his gift to the French Government; but he now consented to place himself unreservedly in the hands of the British Govern ment and to comply fully with all their demands. It may be mentioned that the demands actually made upon the Sultan differed in two respects from those which had received the previous sanction of the Government of India (1) Colonel Meade insisted upon a public announcement of the cancellation of the French agreement. His acting in this respect without 345/99. instructions was not approved by Her Majesty's Government; (2) He insisted not only on the dismissal of Abdul Aziz by the Sultan, but on His Highness promising no longer to receive that individual. Colonel Meade had proposed to add another condition, viz., that the Sultan should agree not to receive representatives of other Powers. This was understood to 190/99. mean Powers which had no treaty rights and to refer to a rumoured intention on the part of llussia to establish a consulate at Muscat; but he was instructed that, under the Declaration of 1862, we had no right to require the Sultan not to receive representatives of other Powers. On the 251/99. 18th February Colonel Meade reported that the Sultan had fully complied with the demands made upon him, including cancellation of the French agreement, prescription to his subjects of the exclusive use of a distinctive flag, and an intimation to the French Consul that he would not receive Abdul Aziz as French Agent. Colonel Meade was authorised to assure the Sultan of our 251/99.6 Pol. 923/00. 331/90. 564/90. 660/09. 714/99. 732, 80o, 998 of 1809. 489/1000. 1006, 2081, 2392 of 1890 2331/99. 2466/09. No. 47 of 1890.' Pol. 2308/09 effective support, if necessary, provided he should continue to follow our advice, but not to hoist the British flag for that purpose. [The revocation, under pressure from the British Government, of the Bunder Gisseh concession by the Sultan led to a lon^ diplomatic negotiation with the French Government, which was not finally settled until iV.ujrust 1000, when an arrangement was arrived at, under which the coal depot at Makalla Cove, which had since 1875 been used by the British Government, was divided into two approximately equal parts, one of which was accepted by the French.] On the 1st March the Viceroy reported that the attitude of the Sultan was a Tain becoming unfriendly, and that he continued to receive clandestine visits from Abdul Aziz, who was endeavouring to cause trouble with the Sharki- yeh tribes. The question of our position at Muscat, under the Declaration of 1862 and the Sultan's engagement of 1891, was therefore submitted for the opinion of the Law-officers of the Crown. Their opinion was to the effect that (1) the Declaration of 1S62 does not require the British Government to abstain from exercising a preponderating influence, so long as that influence is not exerted in any way inconsistent with the independence of Muscat; (2) that the British Government would not be precluded from punishing or even deposing any individual Sultan for breaches of engagements, provided the independence of his successor were recognised; (3) that whilst the question whether the Sultan could be required to dismiss a particular adviser must depend on the special circumstances of the case, it would hardly be compatible with the independence of Muscat to compel the Sultan to accept ministers and advisers who are acceptable to the British Government. It was, however, decided merely to continue to withhold the subsidy. Towards the middle of the month the Sultan became more amenable, but the Government of India preferred to make no further formal demands upon him for the time, although the Customs question and that of the payment of interest on the indemnity remained unsettled, and the maintenance in the office of Wazir of Saiyid Muhammad bin Azzar, who was a creature of the French Consul, caused embarrassment. Before, however, instructions to this effect (dated 25th May) reached him, Colonel Meade had already pressed the Sultan to apply for the loan of a British official to manage his Customs (23rd April) and had received from the Sultan a refusal (9th May). His Highness also continued to evade every attempt made by Major Fagan to induce him to undertake to pay due regard to the advice of the British representative. Trouble began to arise in May with the tribes, owing to the Sultan's inability to pay them the usual cash presents; and a project was formed by them to dethrone Saiyid Faisul. This, however, came to nothing. Mean while the Sultan declined to take any practical steps for enforcing the adoption by his subjects of a distinctive flag. He appeared to dislike the idea, though he objected strongly to the French claims to jurisdiction over his subjects, and he professed to think that the French Government were likely to remedy the existing state of things. In June the French Government complained that the Political Agent at Muscat had endeavoured to persuade the Sultan to order the discontinuance by his subjects of the use of the French flag, and had offered a British ship of war to enforce compliance. This was denied by the Political Agent, and the matter eventually dropped. In August the French Government, in reply to a note by the Charge d'Affaires^at Paris, repeated their declaration (made 16th October .1897) that their undertaking in 1891 to discontinue the issue of their flag to Arab vessels, referred only to their Consulate at Aden; but they admitted that in some cases the flag had been granted without sufficient examination, and stated that thev proposed to revise the regulations governing the practice. In November the Secretary of State, with Lord Salisbury's concurrence, forwarded the correspondence to the Government of India, and suggested for consideration three possible courses which that Government might adopt, viz., to induce the Sultan (1) to insist upon all vessels belonging to his subjects being registered and flying his distinctive flag ; or (2) to declare that, alter a specified date, he would not recognise in his territory any protection or naturalisation thereafter conferred on his subjects otherwise than 'with his7 sanction or under treaty. He referred also to a suggestion (3) that an extended issue of the Britisli flag might he practised, hut indicated that difficulties would arise from the provisions of the existing law. In an earlier Despatch (No. 37 of the 11th August) the Secretary of State 660/90. referred to the question of the subsidy, and suggested, subject to the discretion of the Government of India, that nn early resumption of payment of the subsidy would be likely to make forthc re-establishment of a good understanding with the Sultan. On the SOth September Captain Cox, who had been specially selected for the appointment of Political Agent, arrived at Muscat. lie at first abstained from broaching important questions, and confined himself to endeavouring to obtain the Sultan's confidence. In this he met with considerable success; and the Government of India felt justified in autho- 998/99. rising (13th December) the resumption of payment of the subsidy, with effect from October, the question of the arrears being lelt in abeyance. The outcome of this step was that the Sultan felt himself to be in a position to assume the direct control of his Customs, which had previously been farmed out to contractors. This was regarded by the local authorities as a step in the direction ot meeting the wishes of the Government of India in this 212/1901. respect, and the first year's working of the new arrangement proved to be very satisfactory. In November a certain Frenchman, M. Goguyer, who had arrived at 033,949, Muscat earlier in the year and proceeded thence to Bahrein, returned to Muscat and had an audience with the Sultan. He was evidently in close 330'357^ relations with M. Ottavi, but his actual business was mysterious. It 456' 1200 subsequently transpired that he was contributing Anglophobe letters to the of 1900 Prench newspaper 'La Depeche Coloniale, ' and also endeavouring to 1017,1900. promote the introduction of French trade goods into Muscat. [A suggestion ^0/1901. that the Sultan should take certain steps to put a stop to M. Goguyer's inter- ferenee in Muscat affairs was referred to the Foreign Office on the 10th May 1901; but action of this kind on the part of the Sultan was considered inadvisable, at all events until the Foreign Office had ascertained whether or 1993/1901. not he was an official of the French Government ] 1900. —The Sultan's behaviour during this year continued to be friendly. He co-operated with Captain Cox in carrying out the arrangement with the 1137/1900. French regarding the coaling station in Makalla Cove ; he reinstated Seyyid Saeed as Yizier ; he requested that certain scurrilous leaflets containing false 573 1900. information and malicious comments on British policy, which were being disseminated in Muscat, should be suppressed in the post office ; and, further (as reported by the Viceroy in his telegram of the 22nd May), he offered to sign a letter requesting Her Majesty's Government to discuss the flag 543/1900. question with Uie French Government on his behalf. The Foreign Office were indisposed to do more than to offer friendly representations to the 2152/1900. French Government, which, moreover, they did not expect to be of much practical use. But, before orders were issued, the Sultan visited Snr, in the 639/1900. second week of June, in H.M.S. ' Sphinx,' and obtained from three dhow owners the French papers which they held, and from the remainder ot the Suri French-protected dhow owners, a solemn undertaking to return their flags and papers to the French authorities on the oceasionof their next visit to their port of registry. On his return to Muscat, the Sultan ^ent the three sets of papers which had been surrendered to him, to M. Ottavi, who, however, refused to accept them. He also issued an edict to the following effect:—' We have 684/1900. ' observed that subjects of ours have ignorantly taken flags and articles troin ' a Foreign Government, whereunder they pretend to claim their protection. ' This has taken place in the past, but there must be none of it in the future k&lt; and you must understand that such procedure is contrary to the duties and ' obligations of subjects (to their sovereign). You are hereby informed that we ' do not recognise in our territories {i.e., in the hands of our subjects) such ' flags and protection papers, and will not pardon anyone who takes them otherwise than with our written permission and sanction in accordance 2 2 i5 ^oo, 1,1 with the terms of the treaties between us and Foreign Powers. Let this be ' clear to all.' This edict he communicated to the Consuls on the 15th June; and it was approved by Her Majesty's Government on the clear understanding that it referred only to cases of the issue of flags subsequent to the date of its notification to Foreign Consuls. S. 13. ' 08 Pol. 2195 1900. 684/1900. 2245 1900. 2247/1900. Pol. 780/ 1900. 841, 58 of 1900. 1299/1900. 899 1900. 2345/1900. 1032/1900. 1060/1900. Meanwhile the French Government had taken exception to the Sultan's action in this matter, of which they had received an account which differed from that furnished to Her Majesty's Government by the Britisli Consul. On the 25th June, M. Camhon stated to Lord Salisbury that the dispute was one between the Sultan and the French Government, who would have to insist upon restitution of the papers, and, if necessary, an apology. He subsequently (26th June) requested Her Majesty's Government to instruct their Agent to advise the Sultan to comply. Lord Salisbury declined to commit himself in the absence of full information, and pressed the invalidity of the French claim to grant their protection to the subjects of another Power. M. Cambon stated that the practice would be discontinued for the future, and that existing papers would be examined. Lord Salisbury promised all due respect for French rights and susceptibilities, and suggested the removal of M. Ottavi, who had shown a partisan spirit and caused irritation. On the &lt;oth July the India Office suggested that M. Cambon should be informed that Her Majesty's Government would advise the Sultan to await an examination of the French papers already issued to his subjects before repudiating them, and to arrive at no decision regarding them pending further reference to the Governments of France and Great Britain. The Foreign Office (17th July) preferred not to again raise the question with the French Government, who would probably decline to admit our right to take part in the examination of doubtful cases promised by M. Cambon, but they approved generally the proposed advice to the Sultan. The Viceroy was instructed accordingly (20th July). On the 17th July M. Cambon announced that the French Government were sending a ship partly to establish their new coal depot at Muscat, and partly to enquire into the question whether any dhows flying the French flag were implicated in slave trading. On the 11th August the India Oifice, in forwarding further papers received from India, suggested that the 32nd Article of the Brussels Act might have some application to the probable objection of the French Govern ment to our assistance at, the examination of papers; and on the 24th August and 6th September, Lord George Hamilton proposed that the attention of the French Government should be drawn to certain definite cases of slave trading under their flag reported by Captain Cox, and to admissions of irregularities under the Brussels Act by the Commander of the ' Drome/' Meanwhile on the 18th August, the R. F. ' Drorrie,' arrived at Muscat, and the French authorities at once assumed a threatening attitude towards the Sultan, demanding the return to Sur by the 'Drome,' of the surrendered papers, and the reception of Abdul Aziz as French intermediary. The Sultan firmly refused. In conversation with Captain Cox the Commander of the 'Drome' stated that their demand as to return of the papers was in accordance with an understanding with Lord Salisbury, but Captain Cox rejoined that this was not in accordance with his information. On the 26th August the Viceroy reported that he had instructed Captain Cox that the Sultan's attitude seemed correct, but that His Highness should not refuse to discuss doubtful or disputed cases, and in the case of disagree ment should demand a written statement of the French case. These instructions were 'approved by Her Majesty's Government on the ord September. In the meantime two of the Suris who had actually surrendered their papers to the Sultan (the receipt of which from Uis Highness had been refused by M. Ottavi) arrived in Muscat and personally returned their papers to M. Ottavi, who accepted them. Other Suri dhows, whose owners had signed the solemn undertaking to the Sultan, were intercepted by the ' Drome ' on their way to Busrah and induced to come to Muscat flying the French flag. When appealed to by the Sultan to fulfil their promise, they pleaded that they dared not do so in the presence of the ' Drome,' but would do so later. Finally, they were furnished by the French Consul with fresh ' crew lists,' and proceeded on their voyage. On the 28th August the Sultan asked for a statement of the French claims in writing. This M. Ottavi declined to give. On the 30th the flag question was dropped, but M. Ottavi insisted on the reception of Abdul Aziz. This, also, the Sultan declined, not (Captain Cox reports) through any personal objection, but through fear of displeasing the British Government.On the 4tli September, at a further interview, the French Consul definitely 1004 and informed the Sultan that, if he persisted in his refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, 1089/1900. force would be employed to compel his acquiescence. The Sultan then told Captain Cox that if the British Government would not support him in the g-^ngQQ event of the French using force, he would have to s^ive in. On the advice of Captnin Cox the Sultan then wrote to M. Ottavi recapitulating his version of what had been said on the 4th September, and elicited a confirmation by M. Ottavi in writing of his threat to use force. The Sultan then sent the correspondence to Captain Cox, who thereupon (7th September) addressed a letter to his French colleague inviting his attention to the Declaration of 1862, and stating that in his opinion M. Ottavi's action was incompatible ^•, i 1111 / with the independence of the Sultan, which their respective Governments had mutually agreed to respect. M. Ottavi replied on the 10th September to the effect that he had referred the matter to his Government, and on the 2392/1900. same day the ' Drome ' left Muscat, leaving behind her in charge of the depot an official who speaks Arabic and Swahili fluently . Captain Cox's action was approved by Her Majesty's Government, and the Government of India were instructed to express to the Sultan the appreciation of Her p 0 j 24n9/ Majesty's Government of his desire to observe his promises and 1900. engagements. The Drome' returned to Muscat on the 16th September and left again 1132/1900. on the 18th without, however, any further communication being made by the French Consul to the Sultan. She finally left the Gulf towards the end of October, merely calling at Muscat and Sur, where her commander enjoined 1299/1900. on the French proteges on no account to surrender their papers. In September a further complication was reported by the Government of 929 /190?. India. A certain native of Oman named Hilal-bin-Amr, who had been deported from Zanzibar for intrigues against British influence but had been permitted to return to Zanzibar, arrived at Sur and busied himself in 2197/1897. fomenting dissatisfaction against the Sultan. The Political Resident was authorised to inform the Sultan that he was at liberty to expel this man, in which case he would be sent back to Zanzibar. The Foreign Office under- 1184, 2394 took to discuss with the French Government any claim to French protection ot 1900 - which might be raised by Hilal. The Sultan took the opportunity to 1249/1900. suggest the deportation of a certain Saiyid Ali bin Ali; and the question of getting rid of Abdul Aziz was also raised by the Resident. No report 2648/1900. has yqt been received of action taken in the two former cases; but the Foreign Office objected to any forcible action in the case of Abdul Aziz so long as he remained in French employ. It was ultimately considered inadvisable, even in the event of his consenting to leave Muscat, to press the 1820 /1901. Zanzibar Sultan to receive Abdul Aziz pending the completion of certain negotiations for the surrender of French extra-territorial jurisdiction in Zanzibar. For the rest of the year nothing of great importance was recorded. M. 1132/1900. Ottavi by a stratagem induced the Sultan to give up the third set of French papers surrendered to him at Sur to the son of the owner, on whose appli cation they were at once renewed by the French Consul. A French Agent was also sent to Sur to watch events. The Government of India were not 1184/1900. disposed to sanction a proposal of Captain Cox that a British Agent should also be sent to Sur, nor were they willing for the present to encourage the Sultan, as suggested by Captain Cox, to issue to his subjects articles and crew-lists, printed in Arabic and English, which could be endorsed by tiie British Consul and so constitute a title to the good offices of British Consuls. Thev, however, renewed their recommendation that the Sultan should be 1166/1900. assured that Her Majesty's Government would discuss the flag question with the French Government. Lord Lansdowne undertook (23rd November 1900) 2r)7o/i900. to remind M. Cambon of his promised investigation at a fitting opportunity. In the latter part of November the French cruiser ' Catinat ' J called at 1324/1900. Muscat, and, without making any demands on the Sultan, left on the 30th, Commodore Kiesel having previously announced his intention to repeat his visit next year. At Sur, however, he is reported to have announced that the Sultan had agreed to allow the Suris to retain their French allegiance. To counteract the effect of the 'Catinat's '' visit, the Admiral on the East India 213/1901. Station was requested to show the British flag in the Persian Gulf by as 391/1901.10 Pol. 476/ 1901. many British ships as possible. This visit had, however, to be postponed till March in the following year. 1901 .—Writing on the 3rd February, Captain Cox reported that up to date the Sultan had maintained his firm attitude upon the Hag question ; 391/1901. but that in view of the limited character of the support afforded to him by His Majesty's Government, he was apprehensive of the consequenees of offending the French Government, while the French Consul was endeavour ing to induce the Suris not to abide by their engagement. He further stated that no attempt had been made by the French authorities to discuss with the Sultan the title of any subject of his to fly the French flag. The Foreign Oflice were therefore reminded (9th April) of Lord Lansdowne's proposed communication with the French Ambassador (letter from the Foreign Office, dated 23rd November 1900), and it was suggested to them that the Sultan should again be advised to press for a statement in writing of the French claims upon him. On the 7th March a Belgian steam yacht, which was said to have been chartered by a party, the leader of which was a French Government official, arrived at Muscat, and the party was introduced by M. Ottavi to the Sultan. They were reported to intend visiting Sohar and the ports of the Pirate Coast. On the 9th March two Prussians, one of whom is reported to be a brother of Major Lcontieff of Abyssinian fame, arrived, and were, after some hesitation, received by the Sultan. They subsequently applied for a written permit to import arms, which was refused as unnecessary, and eventually left for Bombay, whence they wrote a complimentary letter to the Sultan, informing him of their intention to return to Muscat after visiting Jibuti. It may be mentioned that in the beginning of April a letter was received at Muscat addressed to the ' Russian Vice-Consul.'' On the 16th the 4 ' Korniloff,' the pioneer vessel of the new Russian line to the Persian Gulf, called at Muscat. She gave, and (on the advice of Admiral Bosanquet) received, a salute, as a special compliment on the occasion of her first visit. In consequence of a report from Captain Cox (dated IStli January) that coal of good quality existed in the neighbourhood of Sur, the Government of India deputed a geological expert. Dr. von Krafft, to inspect the coal fields. He proceeded to Sur in May accompanied by Captain Cox, but found the local Arabs obstructive. The Sultan proceeded to Sur to arrange matters, and a gunboat was also ordered to proceed thither. It was suggested to the 544/01. Foreign Office by the India Office (10th May) that exclusive rights over these coal fields should be secured. The Foreign Office saw no objection, 1988/01. provided the rights were granted by the Sultan not to the Government of India but to a British firm. 611/01. In a letter of the 3rd April Captain Cox suggested that lie should be authorised to advise the Sultan to issue a further Edict, which should practically extend the terms of the Edict communicated to the Foreign Consuls on the 15th June 1900 (see p. 7), to the dhow-owners who had already at that date received French protection. The object was to bring pressure to bear on those dhow-owners to fulfil their undertaking given to 2012/01. the Sultan in June 1900. The Foreign Office, however, have expressed the opinion that the issue of the proposed Edict by the Sultan would not be judicious; and the Government of India have been instructed accordingly. The Foreign Office have been once more pressed to discuss the situation at Muscat with M. Cambon. Political and Secret Department, 7th June 1901. C. G.
