WITH reference to my despatch No. 177 of the 2nd March last, I have the honour to report that I am in receipt of a telegram from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad in which he sets forth certain views suggested by the above-mentioned despatch, copy of which was communicated to him. Mr. Lorimer considers that the formation of a navigation “ combine” is greatly to be deprecated, first because a monopoly would be most prejudicial to trade, and, secondly, because British interests would probably become absorbed, while it is not unlikely that the combine would oppose very influential resistance to any Bagdad- Basra Railway. It is in the interest of the Germans, Mr. Lorimer continues, to keep the communication between Bagdad and Basra inferior to that with Aleppo, and to the interest of Lynch to prevent the realisation of the Basra Railway scheme, while the interests of the country and trade generally demand the construction of the Basra line as soon as possible, and the opening in the meanwhile of the Tigris, like the Karim, to international navigation.

Boar d 0 f Trade, April 25, 1913. ’ I AM directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letters of the 9th and 17tli April, with their enclosures, relative to the possible absorption of the Euphrates Stpa.m Navigation Company, in an international transport company and to offer the following- representing Turkish, .British, and German interests, observations thereon for Sir E. Grey’s consideration: The maintenance of an efficient river service between Basra and Bagdad is, in the opinion of the Board, of the utmost importance to British trade, and they think that every effort should be made to prevent the existing services from passing under the control of interests concerned in the Bagdad Railway, since such control might be used to put an end to river competition when the southern section of the railway has been completed. The Board recognise, however, that it would probably be difficult tor the Euphrates and Tigris Company permanently to refuse to enter mto the suggested international company, should the scheme be pressed by the Turkish Government; and further that, should such a company be constituted, it might be commercially impracticable for competition with it to be maintained by means of the three additional British steamers which the Turkish Government have been asked to sanction. In all the circumstances, and in view of the fact that the interests coneernec m the general navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates are mainly British and I nr is , whilst the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of river navigation are only of a limited and temporary character, the Board are disposed to think that the best course to be adopted would be the conclusion with the Turkish Government of an arrangement for the establishment of an Anglo-Ottoman company for river navigation, which should endeavour to acquire the rights of present concessionnaires, and (subject to such existing rights as might not be acquired) should have the exclusive privilege of navigation upon the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers for a prescribed period, they have accordingly caused the enclosed draft (A) of an agreement on these lines to be prepared, and I am to suggest that, should Sir E. Grey concur m the pioposec po icy, the draft should be communicated to the Turkish Government. In this connection I am to refer also to your letter of the 12th April, and to state that they have given careful consideration to the Turkish counter-draft (communicated by Hakki Pasha) of the proposed railway convention for Asiatic Turkey. * . , counter-draft as it stands appears inacceptable, as not sufficiently safeguarding B interests, the Board are disposed to think that it offers the basis of ^.arrangement, and I am accordingly to forward to you herewith a revised draft ( 1C1 J . caused to be prepared, and to suggest that, subject to Sir E.

Section 2. [21040] No. 1 Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen. (No. 152.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 3, 1913. THE German Ambassador informed me to-day that the Deutsche Bank wished to have the building of the Bagdad Railway beyond Bagdad, even if it was a Turkish concession ; but in the circumstances they would agree to two British directors for this part of the work. Their agreement to this would be facilitated if British capital would come in. They would also be willing to give up any idea of construction beyond Basra, but they would want some indemnity for giving up this part of the concession, j 1 said that I thought that all the concession beyond Bagdad had already been given up in return for concessions made by Turkey elsewhere, especially in the neighbour hood of Alexandretta ; and that Turkey was now entitled to build the railway beyond Bagdad as she liked, provided that, if she asked for any foreign participation, she gave Germany as large a share as any other country. I did not, therefore, see how Turkey could again have to pay an indemnity for the giving up of any part of a concession as regards which she had already purchased her freedon of action, subject to the condition of participation of German capital which I had stated. I had, however, been unable to attend to any details of this subject lately, and I would ask the Ambassador either to The Ambassador also said that the Deutsche Bank hoped that we would give support on the commission in Paris as to the replacement of securities lost during the war, which were pledged to the Bagdad Railway. discuss them with Sir Louis Mallet or to authorise Herr von Kuhlmann to discuss them.

In reply to your despatch No.112 (16836/13) of the 17th ultimo, I have the honour to furnish the following Information which I have obtained from Mr. E. Whitt alt, the acting manager of the National Bank of Turkey, con cerning the Anglo-Belgian group referred to in the letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company of the 11th ultimo. In March 1912 a German gentleman named Wohl called on Mr.Whittall and said that he represented a strong Belgian Syndicate (Mr.Whittall could not recall the names of the firms concerned) which was in treaty with the Turkish Ministry of Finance for the acquisition of the monopoly of the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers to he worked by a company formed by the amalgama tion of the three existing navigation companies, viz., the Turkish Idare Nahrie, the Transports Fluviaux, and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Herr Wohl*s friends had secured the co-operation of the Eastern be Right Honourable Sir E.Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.&lt;3 ^ Eastern Bank, on Indian Financial House which was opened in Bagdad rather more than a year ago, - and he now came to sound ^.Whittall as a Director of the National Bank and as Messrs Lynch's representative in Constantin ople, (as a matter of fact Mr.Whittall had given up this agency). Mr.Whittall said that he would consult 9ir H.Bah ington-Smith and Mr.Lynch. As the result of his own further enquiries, Mr. whittall learnt that, as Herr Wohl had said, the pro posal was favourably received by the Ministry of Finance, who had however stipulated that in consideration! of the monopoly, and of the making over of the fleet of the IdarS Nahrie, the Turkish Government should re ceive 50?'o of the share capital in fully paid up shares, and that the remaining capital should be provided from neutral states, Le. not by British, Geman or French financiers. Mr.Whittall then laid the case before Sir H. Babington Smith and Mr.Lynch, the former of whom de clined participation on behalf of the National Bank, while the latter expressed his readiness to join the enterpriseenterprise tut only on condition that the Euphrates and Tigris Stsam Navigation Company should not he ab sorbed by the new Company. Herr Wohl appears to have pushed the matter with considerable activity during the sunnier and in October again approached Mr.Whlttall, who informed him of the replies received from the National Bank and Mr.lynch, and further suggested that the various permits to run steamers on the Tigris granted to natives by the local authorities (as e.g., that possessed by Agha Jaffer) seemed to stand in the way of a monopoly. Herr Wohl replied that these permits had not been confirmed by the Porte and could bo revoked. All this infonnation is in the possession of kr. Lynch, end his suggestion that the proposal was institut ad by the National Bank is therefore incorrect, (to. Parry * s letter of the 13th March 1913). Mr.Whittall believes that since the outbreak of the Balkan War the matter has not been pursued further here as Herr Wohl has been away for some months. Sir® i4 Sir R.Cra’.vforci had heard nothing of Herr Wohl's proposals and he believes that T&gt;he Gerinan group is also unaware of them, and cannot therefore have 'thrown cold water on them' as stated In Mr.Parry's letter. In view of the declarations so often made by the Government that the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris is reserved to natives, and to companies formed exclusively of Ottoman shareholders, it is difficult to see hov/ the monopoly, which Herr Y/ohl desires to obtain can be granted, unless the Government is pre pared to submit the question to the Chamber and obtain .1 III ml - its assent to it, and as Sir R.Crawford has never been consulted by the Government in regard to the scheme, I am lad to think that its practical chances of success are small, and that in considering the present situation we can assume that it has been dropped. ItIt would perhaps however he ae well to enquire cl ;&gt; ooers. Lynch what grounds they have for helieving that the An, r Uio**BeijsiaB gi*oup, i^he Engiiiah elem^no in which is apparently represented not by the National Bank hut by the Eastern Bank, is still continuing its negotiations. (Mr. Parry*s letter of thn» 11th April)* If I have correctly understood Messrs. Lynch's letter of the. 11th instant I gather that their position, vis a vis of the Bout echo Bank’s proposal, io that they are quite willing to admit Turkey to a share in the existing cl St 6 de Transports Bluviaux - vrhic.h, I may remark, is expressly providec for in the statutes of the compari, &gt; (see enclosure to Mr. Barling's dosis tch No• 675 of the 8th August last); but that if it is proposed to transform this temporary concern into a permanent com pany, incorporating both the Idare NahriS and the % % Euphrates and Tigrle Steam 'eviration Company, they decline the proposal. tJ.though thoy ■ ould he ready to assist in the formation of an Anglo-Gemono-Ottoman Company possessing exclusive rights of navigation, but always provided that the independent existence of the Euphrates&lt;5&gt; !7 suggestion as a request for participation y/ithovt anv coKsnensurate consideration being oflorec in excttxge• It tnerefore ceens to me probo.ble that the chances of the formation of a tripartite company on the lines desired by Messrs. Lynch are small, while there is the possibility that Germans end Turks may come to un agreement from which Messrs. Lynch would be excluded and -which would result in creating a very serious competition against the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Two statements in Mr. Parry's letter of the 11th April seen to cull for note, viz: that 'essrs. Lynch .i. believe it to be possible to secure Anglo-German co operation in the Bagdad-Khanikin branch; and that It would be good policy to give the Oernano a Bhare in the river navigation. Ae to the former, it would he of interest to know why the Bagdad Railway should he dis posed to accopt our co-operation on this section. The branch from Sadijoh is not long, not more than eighty mllos, and does not run through difficult country, so that it is scarcely our financial assistance that is » sought, while on the other hand it would seem probable that the Germans would be particularly anxious to re tain18 retain control of the door into Persia in their own hands. The second passage I have quoted seems to re veal a strange misconception on the part of tessrs. Lynch ac to the actual position, when they talk of w giving a share' in the navigation to the Germans. The introduction of the German interests rests with the Turks, and if they should find it to their advantage to bring that about, we might find it not too easy a matter to prevent it. This advocacy of co-operation with Germany is, if I am not mistaken, a distinct chunga of attitude on the part of M r. Lynch. Mr. Parry in his letter of March 13th challenges the statement made to me by Sir P. Crawford as to the inadequacy of the service effected by the Pociete des % Transports Fluviaux; I would recall that Sir P. Craw ford* b account was confirmed by a report from It. Consul Crow dated February 25th, to the effect that the Bagdad Hallway Company had been obliged to obtain the services of thuee steen tugs belonging to Messrs. Wonckhaus.

LONDON, lltL April,1913. 16836) frrlctly Confidential Sir: - With reference to correspondence that has passed between us on the subject of the navigation of the Tigris, I have now the honour to report that we have received a reply from the Deutsche Rank to our recent letter of which we sent you a Summary in our letter of the 29th ultimo. The Deutsche Bank states that in principle the Turkish; Government has consented to participate to the l extent of one third In the Railway Transport Company, but that the Turkish Government would prefer to enlarge the scope and objects of this Anglo-Ceman-Turkish Pailway Transport Company so as to make ft embrace not only the transport of railway material and the vessels of the Soci6t6 de Transports Pluviaux but also the 1 carrying of general cargo and the vessels both of the Idara Mahrieh and of this Company. The answer of the Turkish 1 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.@ 24 Turkish Government Is described as a 'Yes, but.' They are prepared to come In to the small concern but would much prefer the larger. We have no Independent con firmation of this. Before sending a reply to this communication I am directed by my Board to ascertain the wishes of ^is Majesty's Government. The slate is clean and we are anxious to write nothing upon the slate that may not have the approval of His Majesty's Government. It may assist His Majesty's Government in coming to a conclusion if we endeavour very briefly to set out the situation as a whole. The Germans are engaged in constructing the rail way from the Mediterranean to Baghdad with the utmost possible expedition and from the two ends. They con template concurrent construction from Baghdad to the Persian frontier. They hold a great quantity of Baghdad Pailway bonds which they have not yet succeeded in placing. For this and for political reasons they are anxious to arrive at a settlement with His Majesty's Government which shall be satisfactory to British interests in these countries. The results of the Balkan war con firm them in these desires. TheThe key of the railroad position, so far as British* trade is concerned, is the railway fron Baghdad to the Persian frontier, with the extension fron Baghdad to the holy places. We believe it to be possible to secure Anglo-German co-operation both in the construc tion and in the control of this line. If we at the same time strengthen and develop our already strong position on the rivers, we need not fear so much any advantages which may be given to German trade over the railway from the Mediterranean to Baghdad. We can descry no great anxiety on the part of the Germans to continue the railway from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. And it would be impossible to fix an alignment for such a railway that would not require to be recast after the country has been developed by ir rigation. It is evident that the Germans are turning their eyes in the direction of the river navigation. They desire a share, though there Is ample reason to believe that they would be satisfied with a share whicf should not be predominant. It would seem to be good policy to give them such a share and to interest them in the navigation.(?) ib We cannot see that this would necessitate the absorption of this Company with the consequent dis appearance of the British flag. This is a Turkish rather than a German aim. This Company would prefer to remain a British Company and this preference has been strengthened by recent happenings in Turkey. But, if this Company is to remain a British Com pany, it will need the strong support of His Majesty’s Government in the direction of the removal of + be res trictions at present imposed upon its development. Assured of such support on the part of TJr is Majesty's Government, we could face a difficult situa tion with comparative equanimity and we could reply to the Deutsche Bank, with the approval of His Majesty's Government, that, while not averse to participating equally with the Deutsche Bank in the immediate crea tion of an Anglo-German-Turkish Company to obs^orb the steamers of the Brussels Company for the carriage of railway material and the existing Turkish steamers and greatly to improve the existing river service, \ keep our own Company separate and distinct, agreeing at the same time to an arrangement for a poollnr of freights on the basis of the proportion of the total that27 that this Company and the Turkish Company have res pectively been receiving in recent years. In the future as trade increases, we should, under an arrange ment of this kino, of course require further facilities in order to enable us to deal with our proportion. I Otherwise, we should go to the wall. We might, of course, alternatively, reply to the Deutsche Bank rejecting their proposition altogether and again urging them to adhere strictly to the Agree ment in force between us - to get the Turks to come in to the Failway Transport Company. But Herr von Cwinner would feel himself crossed and would never tire of im pressing upon us that we had lost a most favourable opportunity of securing Turkish co-operation in the realization of an improved river service. We have heard privately, though not from the Deutsche Bank, that the Snglo-Belglan Group, of which we have spoken on a previous occasion, is continuing its negotiations. We should be obliged if you would kindly enquire of Tils 'ajesty's Ambassador in Constan tinople whether he car give us any information on this poInt.

LONDON, E.C. 11th April, 1913. Sir:- In reply to your letter of the 9th instant convey ing to us the purport of a report received through His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople from His Majesty's Consul at Busreh on the subject of the transport of railway material up the Tigris, I am directed by my Board to draw your attention to the closing words of your summary in which it is correctly stated that the three German tugs are to be withdrawn from the service directly the vessels of the Societe are in a position to take it up. These three tugs were already under construction when we were negotiat ing with the Baghdad Railway Company and they have, therefore, of course appeared earlier upon the scene. We understand that they will, in future, be used for transhipping cargo at Busreh instead of forming the nucleus The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.©31 nucleus of a German steamship service on the Tigris. It is not quite clear from your letter whether you desire to suggest that the report in question hears out the former reports you received from Constantinople to the effect that the Societe was unable to cope with the work of transporting the material. Of course it cannot cope with the work before its fleet is ready, which will very shortly be the case, as we expect. The Statutes etc. of the Societe are in your possession and they make it plain that the constitution and financial resources and backing of the Societe are more than sufficient to enable it to deal with the transport of the railway material. If the Deutsche Bank and ourselves in co operation are unable to conduct an enterprise of this kind, we must both of us have, indeed, fallen upon evil days. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Fred. W.

THE acting Russian consul called to-day to ask if I could inform him whether a company had been formed by Messrs. Lynch, the Deutsche Bank, and the Ottoman Government for forwarding the Bagdad Railway material, and whether the Turkish river steamers were assisting in the present operations. I replied that I had seen some mention in the newspapers of the probability of a subsidiary company being formed, such as he suggested, but that I had no definite information on the subject. I said I understood the Turks were offering no objection to the present arrangements, by which the material was forwarded in the vessels of the Compagnie des Transports fluviaux en Orient, and that Lynch Brothers were acting solely as agents for the Bagdad Railway Company in the management of this fleet, and were not employing their own steamers for the purpose. I added that, as far as I was aware, both the Idareh Nahrieh and Aga Jafer Companies had participated in the transport till the end of January last, and that the new arrangements began in February. The Russian authorities seem to be following the matter with close attention. My Russian colleague, M. Toukholka, who has recently been transferred to Crete, made several references, before his departure, to the formation of a subsidiary company for the purpose, in which the Turks were to take shares.

Sir, In reply to your Letter No. 14,674, of the 9th instant, regarding transport on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it will be difficult to prevent Messrs. Lynch from coming to an arrangement with the Bagdad. Railway Company as regaids the existing concession ; but that if His Majesty’s Government obtain the three additional ships from the Turkish Government and transfer them to Messrs. Lynch, stringent conditions can presumably be imposed, including the presence of a Government Director on the Board with a power of veto. 2. But below this difficulty lies the fundamental difficulty that the policy of the Bagdad Railway Company, if they get a footing on the river (whether through Messrs. Wonckhaus or otherwise)—which it will be difficult to prevent—will probably be to undercut Messrs. Lynch by quoting through rates on the railway and German ships. This contingency was foreseen when the whole question was under discussion in June last, and it can apparently only be met by similar measures on our part, i.e., either by direct subsidy, or by an interworking arrangement between Indian railway companies and the steamship companies concerned. The Marquess of Crewe will obtain the views of the Government of India on this subject, but it will necessarily require careful consideration, and an immediate answer is not to be expected. 3. In the meantime I am to suggest that the question of amalgamation should be more closely examined. The parties immediately concerned appear to be the Turkish Government, the Turkish Nahriye Company, and His Majesty’s Government (if the view taken in your letter of 26th March is correct), acting through Messrs. Lynch. No foreign power or firm has any permanent rights of navigation, but it should be observed that the temporary Societe des Transports Fluviaux (one-half of whose capital is held by the Bagdad Railway Company, and the other half by Messrs. Lynch), has the right of transporting general merchandise as well as railway material. But this is a right as against Messrs. Lynch, and not as against the Puikish Government. The Turkish Government are now understood to favour the formation of a single Turkish Company, combining all interests, for the navigation of the rivers. But apparently, except for the temporary interest of the Bagdad Railway Company in the Societe above- mentioned, the sole interests are Turkish and British, and the question suggests itself whether the Turkish Government could not The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.2 be induced to agree to the formation of a Turkish company, of which half the capital and half the directing Board should be British, His Majesty’s Government not concerning themselves with the source from which the Turkish capital might be obtained. It was held by the Board of Trade that 50 per cent, participation in the railway would suffice to prevent measures hostile to our interests, and the same would presumably apply to the river also. If this is impracticable, the only alternative form of amalgamation is one in which bond fide British interests would be in a minority—since Lord Crewe could not regard the National Bank (whose participation has been suggested) as a British concern for the present; purpose. But as it has already been agreed that the maintenance of effective river competition is essential, it is difficult to see how His Majesty’s Government could acquiesce in such an amalgamation, and the only means they apparently possess of preventing it is their hold over Messrs. Lynch. As regards this, His Lordship is of opinion that it would be too strong a measure, after all that has taken place, for them to assert their rights as the original concessionaire to prevent Messrs. Lynch from entering the combine. On the other hand it appears to him that a one-fourth participation could be of so little value to Messrs. Lynch that they could only contemplate entering on those terms with the intention of being ultimately bought out, and this, in his opinion, His Majesty’s Government would be fully entitled to prohibit. If this view is correct, the knowledge that it would be prohibited would probably suffice to prevent Messrs. Lynch from entering, or would at all events induce them to disclose their real position. I am accordingly to suggest that if, after consideration of my letter of 7th instant, Sir E. Grey is satisfied that His Majesty’s Government are on firm ground, Messrs. Lynch should be at once informed of the view which they take of the concession, and told that in no circumstances will the transfer of British interests be permitted.

It will be observed in the first place, from the enclosure in the despatch from His Majesty*s Ambas sador at Constantinople, that in spite of the protesta tion of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany originally made in their letter of the 13th ultimo (copy of which was enclosed in the letter from this Of fice of the 26th ultimo) and now repeated in their let ter of the 26th ultimo that there is any inadequacy in the arrangements for the transport of railway material, a serious shortage in this respect does in fact exist. It has seemed well to Sir E. Grey to call the at- hhe Under Secretary of State India Office. *0 i 43 ( 14674 / 13 ) attention of the Company to the facts reported hy Mr. Crow. As regards the general aspect of the question, the Company in their letter of the 13th ultimo deny that they have been approached with a view to participation in a permanent river transport company, or that they have given any encouragement to such a scheme and they maintain their attitude in their subsequent letter while forwarding in it a copy of a communication to the Deutsche Bank in which they express their willingness to enter into such a combination. Sir E. Grey has learnt from another but equally sure source that it is the intention of the Sublime Porte to propose this solution of the question, the re sult of which would be that, instead of granting to His Majesty's Government the right to place three ad- V.r - V-( V'-* % v Y t\ -i i \ ' f y vy Ay ditional steamers on the river as proposed in the memorandum of July 18th last, they offer an arrangement whereby the present British company will be absorbed by a Turco-German combination and perhaps eventually excluded altogether from the river while the British flag will in any case disappear from it. Such(14674/13) Such a solution, coupled with the renunciation of British rights as regards the Bagdad Bailway carrot fail, in Sir E. Grey's view, to produce ar unfavourable effect or putlie opinio^ in this country, tut he finds it difficult to see how the object of maintaining com petition between the railway and the river by means of an independent British steamship company can be secured or how such a company is to be prevented from coming to a^ arrangement with the Bagdad Ballway Com pany as to rates or from being bought out by the lat ter if advantageous terms are offered to them. This result might be attained were His Majesty's Government prepared to maintain the British company in existence by means of a subsidy and I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn whether, in the opinion of the Marquess of Crews such a course should be adopted or whether the principle of amalgamation should be accepted and an effort made to obtain the best(14674/13) best possible terms for the British Company.

We know of no outline of a scheme for the formation of a permanent river Transport Company put forward by the Baghdad Railv/ay Company; no such scheme has been submitted to our Company. We have therefore not had occasion to express an opinion favourable or otherwise. We have a letter from the Deutsche Bank dated the 18th instant informing us that the Turkish Government now seems disposed to enter into the com bination for the transport of railway material. You are aware that it is part of our agreement with the Deutsche Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Deutsche Bank that the Turkish Government shall have the right to participate to the extent of one third. The Deutsche Bank add that the Turkish Government seem Inclined to convert the proposed Anglo-German- Turkish Company into a general shipping company, absorbing this Company and the Turkish river Company.

At the same time you inform us that you have reason to believe that the Turkish Government would he in clined to convert the Railway Transport Company into a general Shipping Company. It must he obvious that a great many questions would arise in connection with the latter proposal, the solution of which will take considerable time. We should also consider it necessary as a matter of courtesy to consult our Government before embarking on such negotiations. We must therefore beg you to adhere to the arrangement in force between us and to endeavour to obtain at the earliest moment the adhesion in principle of the Turkish Government to participation to the extent of one-third in the Railway Transport Company.

(Confidential.) Your Highness, Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply of HiS Majesty’s Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Bailway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard ro the Bagdad Railway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Riverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY. Enclosure. Memorandum communicated to the Ottoman Government. 1. HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern- [1370] ^ ^ B— rr-T'-r 2 ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Questicm. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway w T hich is to traverse a region where British-Tndian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. Hie Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— Draft Con vention (Annex 2). Draft Con vention (Annex 3). (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (b.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the c instruction or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/.) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the regiori of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by3 His Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Bailway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty’s Government must in the first instance protest against the con- that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. D. I he original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty s Go\ernment maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no 1 urkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4. Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of 1 urkish power ever having been paramount; and they aie fully persuaded that El Katr has never betm locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. f oi themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Go\ eminent are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majestys Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan beinof admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military Memo- post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with ^ au, * um the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. (Annex 4). 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the svstem in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they ha\e acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf ; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) lo police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development4 Memo randum (Annex 5). ol trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1!)11 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now howeeer that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essenti^ part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. Annex 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office. Annex 2. Draft Articles for a Convention between the British and Ottoman Governments in respect of Railways in Asiatic Turkey. Article 1.

Article 5. Any complaints which may be brought to the notice of the Imperial Ottoman Government by His Britannic Majesty’s Government, in respect of the treatment of traffic of any kind under the provisions of the foregoing articles, shall immediately be communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government to the railway administration or administrations concerned, and, unless settled to the satisfaction of the two Governments within three months, be forthwith referred to the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which shall have power to determine the matter finally and to award damages. Any determination or award of the International Court of Arbitration shall be immediately enforced by the Imperial Ottoman Government, and any damages awarded shall be paid by the Imperial Ottoman Government to His Britannic Majesty’s Government to be dealt with at their discretion.

Annex 3. Draft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-el-Arah Navigation Commission. THE Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows :— 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all nations. 2. The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty. [1370] C6 % 4. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of &lt;£ T. 2,000 tree of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid by the Commission. 5. The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties :— (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (6.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. (e.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/.) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact ot navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues excsed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 11. Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be advanced by the high contracting parties at a rate of interest not exceeding 6 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 12. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 13. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. 14. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to, cover its ordinary expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 15. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of repute, to be agreed upon by the commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 16. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities.17. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, buildings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the discharge of their duties by the officers of the police, pilotage, or other services maintained by the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 18. The transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect the territorial jurisdiction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction, nor shall anything in this Convention be deemed to give the Commission power to exercise jurisdiction or to carry out duties or to hold land outside the limits of the Ottoman Empire without the consent of the territorial Power, or to affect the operation or the interpretation of the provisions of any treaty or arrangement prescribing or defining the limits of the said Empire. I 9. This agreement shall be binding during twenty-one years from the day of its signature. In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years, of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. Annex 4. Koweit. HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na’airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Radaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. Districts and Islands .—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Riqa’i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakab, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and ’Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Koweit. Annex 5. Mohammerah Frontier. [Four Maps mentioned in this Annex not reproduced.] HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [1370] D8 conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the Great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major afteruaids Sn lleniy) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point u’here it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15J miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The wdiole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, wdio exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows : 1 . That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3 . That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just w^est of Shu aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usuallv marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it asa pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to the^ neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin ( anal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, s' and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2 .) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. o and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. the claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Furbish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. Fhe local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See mans Nos. 3 and 4.) F This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that* where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “ thalweg ” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. . records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession ” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while im express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i-) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Maawiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. ( 6 .) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh.10 (ii ) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. ...... . (iii.) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is m the mam stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Ivarun, to be lecognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) _ (iv) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. . (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood _ or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. # . . (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated m Turkish territory. oThis document is the property of the Secreta ry of State for India in Council Secret. Bagdad-Basra Railway. I. The present position.—Kt the interdepartmental conference of 30th March 1911, Sir E. Grey proposed that we should ask for 50 per cent, participation, and a memorandum for the Turkish Government was prepared on this basis. On the 7th April 1911 the Board of Trade wrote that there were “only two practicable policies ” ( 1 ) “ to participate in the working of the southern section on terms of equality with German}*, but to the “ exclusion of all third parties as regards control,” and ( 2 ) to refuse participation altogether. Xo further communications passed between the depaitments on this subject, but on 12th July 1911 a draft memorandum to the I urkish Government was privately communicated to the India Office, this memoianaum contained the proposal, which was actually made to the Turkish Ambassador on 29th July 1911, that Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, and Turkey, should participate at the rate of 20 per cent, each, and that a convention should be drawn up precluding differential rates on all the i ail ways of Asia Minor. The Turkish Government replied on 15th April 1012 , not expressly rejecting this proposal, but substituting 25 per cant, paiticipation for Great Britain, France, Germany, and Turkey, to the exclusion of Russia. But in the private discussions that preceded the despatch ol this reply the Turkish representatives more than once stated in the stlongest teiins their objection, on political grounds, to the inclusion of Russia, and said that if His Majesty s Government pressed it they would be obliged to insist on the admission of Switzerland. This His Majesty’s Government would of course not be able to accept, for it would strengthen the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest at our expense. Russia, it will be borne in mind, has said that, while she only wants to help us, she wants to be admitted if France is admitted. The Turkish counter-proposal of 15th April 1912 is therefore not a mere modification of our own, but, in effect, a complete rejection of it. A new situation is thus created, and it is submitted that m the circumstances His Majesty’s Government are bound to consider it on its merits, and that it is possible foi us, without doing any violence to diplomatic conventions, or giving any just cause of offence to Turkey, to treat our proposal of 29th July 1911 as completely out of court, and to substitute for it a better one, if such can be found. It may lie conceded that as we have actually proposed the admission of France and Russia our position is no longer as strong as it was for proposing their omission. But here the Turks have fortunately helped us. For if Russia insists on participating in the event of French participation, while Turkey will admit France but not Russia, the result is a deadlock of which the only solution is the omission of both. The following considerations are intended to show that the proposal of 29th July 1911 should not be pressed, and that the terms which Sir E. Grey originally wished to put forward are, as the Board of Trade held, the only ones on which we should now consent to participate. II. The objections to the last proposals made by His Majesty's Govern- ment .—The view underlying those proposals is that, provided we can secureli &gt; a convention absolutely precluding differential rates on the whole of the Bagdad Railway system, the degree of our participation in the Gulf section is immaterial, and that it is in fact worth our while to purchase the convention by abating our claims to participation. The objections are :— (а) That no convention can absolutely preclude differentiation or the application of those advantages which Protectionist countries accord their trade. This is in effect the Board of Trade view also. ( б ) That the Bagdad Railway Convention already does so, far as any convention can. See Article 24 of the Cahier des Charges : “ tons “ les tarifs, qu’ils soient generaux, speciaux, on proportionnels on “ differentiels, sont applicables a tons les voyageurs et expediteurs “ sans distinction.” This applies to the Bagdad-Khanikin branch (Article 1 of the Convention), and to the Alexandretta concession, which is given on the same terms as the Convention of 1903 except where otherwise specified. (c) Differential rates are not the only risk involved in absence of effective control. The Bagdad Railway Committee in its-report of 2Cth March 1907, quoted Sir James Mackay’s opinion that the Company, if under “ a management of which this country exercised no “ influence or control ” “ would lose no time in establishing a line “ of steamers from the terminus to Bombay, and in course of time “ they would virtually monopolize the entire trade between India “ and the Persian Gulf, because it would be impracticable for the “ British lines to compete against the ships supported by the “ Railway Company, which would give through bookings and “ through rates for passengers and cargo.” This danger would, exist the moment that the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest preponderated over the British interest, i.e., the moment the latter Avas less than 50 per cent. Again, there is the risk (referred to in the same report) that the “ Railway Company Avill make it their business to cut the freights “ between Basra and Bagdad, so as to be able to compete Avith the “ river-borne traffic,” that is to say, the Bagdad Railway Company, if preponderant on the Gulf section, Avill dm T e the steamers off the river, and then raise the rates on the railway. They Avill not, of course, be able to do so beyond the point at which it will pay to put the steamers back on the river. But in order that avc may be ready to take advantage of that moment AA T hen it comes it Avill be necessary that the steamers shall be there, which probably means paying Messrs. Lynch or someone else a subsidy to keep them efficient, though idle—another charge on the revenue of the Gulf Section before it can pay a dividend. (d) The Gulf section being the shortest necessarily determines the rates on the northern section to Bagdad. It is therefore our interest to have as free a hand as possible on that section. Therefore a cjnvention applicable to the Avhole Bagdad Railway system is a positive disadvantage to us. (e) It is our interest to have as free a hand as possible because it is essential to prevent the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest from getting the preponderance. This is not sufficiently secured by the 20 per cent, participation, since Ave cannot depend on the permanence3 in all circumstances of the entente, commercially and financially (French finance, for example, is notoriously beyond the control of its Government); while politically it may be a serious source of weakness elsewhere (as pointed oat by the Viceroy in his telegram of 29th May —see Appendix) that we should have important commercial interests bound up with the permanence of the entente in Mesopotamia. (/) As a financial proposition it is to be feared that 20 per cent, in an international railway 350 miles long costing less than 3,000,000Z. to construct, will not be considered worth looking at. On the other hand the lacts that ( 1 ) the German Company has first of all to be compensated ; ( 2 ) rolling stock has to be provided and ports to be built; (3) the expenses of international management will be unnecessarily heavy; (4) the railway will have no prospect of paying for many years (until, in fact, Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed); (5) in the meantime there will be no guarantee (for it may be taken as certain that the Government of India, at all events, will give no guarantee) ; will be further disastrous to its flotation. The British share will simply not be taken up : and where is the Russian share to come from, when the Russian Government cannot find money for its favoured project, the Trans- Bersian Railway, and Russian unofficial finance is concentrated on that enterprise ? (d) therefore, participation on these terms is of no value as a financial proposition, and if we have not sufficient control to prevent the Bagdad Railway interest from preponderating, there is no apparent commercial advantage in participation over non-participation. (h) The Gulf section would be a most valuable political asset if it were all British. It would still be valuable if it were British controlled, but it loses in value by leaps and bounds as British participation diminishes, until a point is reached where prestige will suffer less and dignity be better consulted if the country which owns 70 per cent, of the trade and 85 per cent, of the shipping stands aloof altogether, rather than participates on an equality with three other Powers who have practically no material stake in the country at all. (?) No attempt has been made to show how the joint arrangement is to work in practice, e.g., is the actual working agency to be international, and is it seriously thought that that would be workable ? Again, in order that the commercial interests of the line may be effectively safeguarded, it must be worked independently of, and to some extent in opposition to, the Bagdad Railway : but it is extremely doubtful whether any arrangement with this object would be found workable in practice. III. The view therefore supported is that of the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911—that the only alternatives are to participate on a 50 per cent, basis (to which it should be added that, in that case, the Chairman must be British), or not to participate at all. (a) I he view that British control on the Gulf section is useless without a convention to prevent differential rates on the rest of the system has already been dealt with. It has also been pointed out thatby controlling the shortest section we should, in fact, control the rates over the German section. It may further be urged that the sole effect to the Bagdad Railway Company of imposing differential rates against British goods between Alexandretta and Bagdad would be to send British trade round to the Basra-Bagdad line. With 50 per cent., the casting vote on the Board, and a free hand as regards rates, our position would, therefore, be impregnable. (b) What would it be if we did not participate at all ? It must be premised that from the British and Indian point of view it is better that the railway should not be built. It must be remembered that there is no analogy between tbe position now and the position in 1903. Then we might have had substantial participation in the whole length of the railway, which would, besides, have admitted us to the exploitation of a new country. Xow we are offered 20 per cent, in a branch 350 miles long, which will admit other Powers on equal terms with us to the exploitation of a country of whose trade we already have 70 per cent. Politically. —The construction of the railway means the military and administrative consolidation of Turkey in Mesopotamia, with an increased tendency to seek influence in the Persian Gulf, and to extend control in Arabia, and an increased power of offensive against British interests, including Koweit and Mohammera. It further means the firmer establishment of German, French, and Russian interests—with a corresponding tendency to intervene—in a region where the outside interests have hitherto been preponderatingly British. (It is not of course suggested that we can, or ought to try to, keep every one else out; but to invite them in, and on such terms, is quite another matter.) Commercially. —Our interests are twofold. There is the existing trade with Western Persia via Bagdad and Khanikin, and the trade which is expected to grow up when Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed. The Persian trade is worth about 2,000,000b It is difficult to forecast its future; but if the Trans-Persian Railway is built, and Mohammera connected with it and with Burujird, the Persian trade will presumably desert Bagdad altogether. If Persian Railways remain in abeyance, it is not clear that we shall be worse off than we are at present, so long as the river between Bagdad and the Gidf is open, and Article 24 of the Cahier des Charges operates to prevent differential rates on the Bagdad Railway. Again, the future local trade of Mesopotamia, being mainly in agricultural products, will probably in any case flow westwards to Alexandretta. This view seems to be borne out by the latest figures available for the trade of Bagdad, 1910, which are as follows :— Imports to Bagdad. From—United Kingdom - France Austria-Hungary Belgium Germany United States of America India, China, and Japan £ - 1,317,762 - 203,284 - 180,011 - 211,835 53,705 806 - 664,147Exports from Bagdad. £ To—United Kingdom 330, J61 France - - 132,131 Austria-Hungary 14,501 Belgium 3,077 Germany 30,441 United States of America - 155,049 India, China, and Japan 87,478 The bulk of the British and Indian imports seems to be in cotton goods, twist and woollens, and that of the exports carpets, wool, opium and hides. It is, however, possible that cotton will be grown and pressed in Mesopotamia and will find its way into eastern markets, and the mineral resources of the country (especially oil) may also add to the trade eastwards. But, speaking generally, it does not seem certain that the volume of trade resulting from the development of Mesopotamia will necessitate the construction of the Gulf section if ■ India is not to lose its share, and it is probable that India will retain her share whether it is built or not. But, of course, it is not possible to assume that the railway will never be built. From the difficulty which it is understood that the Germans have had in disposing of the bonds of the other sections of the Bagdad Railway, and from their willingness to part with their rights in the Gulf section, it may, indeed, be inferred that they will be in no hurry to undertake the latter, while tin.' Turks themselves have neither the money nor the means of obtaining it. The construction will therefore be postponed, but - as the line is of military and political importance to Turkey—it will eventually be built In the interval much may have happened in Mesopotamia, as the Viceroy has reminded us, and it is not easy to foresee the conditions that will then exist. But, supposing that the railway is worked on commercial lines, and •that the clause precluding differential tariff's is still operative, it does not appear, from the point of view of our trade, that 1 he fact of our having no share in it will be a disadvantage. But, of course, it may not be run on commercial lines. Protected by their kilometric guarantees the Germans 711 ay prefer to let it rust—it would always be available for 'Turkish military purposes-- and attract all the trallic to the Northern section. In that case, too, it does not appear that, provided the river ivere kept free, we should be any worse off commercially than if the line did not exist at all. Politically, no doubt, we should be, because the Turkish consolidation would be effected, and if the railway were built under German auspices, German influence would be brought very near to the Gulf. But provided that we can ensure that the line will not be carried beyond Basra or, if so, only on terms agreeable to Great Britain, and provided that we have in the meantime consolidated our own position in the Gulf, that risk might fairly be taken. 'The one serious drawback would be that referred to under head (c) on Page 2—the danger of the extinction of the British carrying trade between India and Bagdad. Although this disadvantage might to some extent be compensated by the advantages that might accrue to other branches of trade, it is a very real one and would have to be faced. (It could only be met, apparently, by a corresponding interworking between steamships and railwav S. 169. Dcompanies on the Indian side— a matter which would obviously require very careful consideration). Moreover, as has already been pointed out, it is equally attendant upon any arrangement which does not secure to this country effective control of the Gulf section. IV. The 'importance of the river. —The necessity of keeping the river open has been emphasised throughout these remarks. By that is meant not only ensuring that it is kept properly dredged and navigable, and that no prohibitive dues are placed upon shipping (both of which will be secured, as far as the Shat-el-Arab is concerned, by the separate Convention setting up a Riverain Commission), but also by maintaining the right of navigation as far as Bagdad. This is equally necessary, for the reasons already given, whether we renounce the Railway altogether or participate in it on terms short of effective control. It is therefore essential that the questions should at once be closely examined with a view to ascertaining exactly what rights of navi gation British shipping possesses on the Tigris and Euphrates, and what steps should be taken to put them on a secure basis. V. Conclusions. —The conclusions seem to be— 1. That, if the river is open, it is better for us that the railway should never be built ; 2. That it is therefore not our interest to facilitate it except on terms which will make it commercially and politically advantageous to ourselves; 3. That the only terms on which it will be thus advantageous are that we secure effective control, i.e., 50 per cent, participation, the casting vote on the board of management, and a tree hand as regards rates. 4 That failing that, we should stand out altogether, and con centrate on getting what we want in the Gulf, and especially the joint control with Turkey of the Shat-el-Arab and the right of navigation to Bagdad, which are really the key to the situation. Mr. Brereton (Government Director of Indian Railway Companies) has read and entirely concurs in these remarks so far as they touch on the commercial aspects of the scheme. VI. The practicability of obtaining 50 per cent. —At the interdepartmental conference of 30th March Sir E. Grey had apparently no doubt of this, and he at once proceeded to prepare the ground with France and Russia. France. —Sir E. Grey to Sir F. Bertie, No. 123, of 6 th April 1911 “ M. “ Cambon . . . had told Count Benckendorff that the question as to “ whether France should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section was one “ which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to “ do so, but she did not regard it as her affair.” Russia.Sir F. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan, No. 105, of 10th April 1911. Count Benckendorff said that . . . “ the Russian desire was to help “ us, and therefore their proposal \i.e., to participate] would not hold if the “ question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, “ that if it was ultimately decided to have French co-operation, Russia “ should come in too.” The India Office has no later information than this.Germany .—The India Office has not heard of any overtures to Germany on the subject. We know only that in 1909 M. Gwinner informed Sir E. Cassel that the Germans had no objection to Great Britain obtaining more than 50 per cent., and that it was from Hussein Hilmi that the opposition then came. Further, in 1911, Sir G. Lowther wrote (No. 183, of 22nd March) “ Prominent Germans here have recently been hinting that “ the Turks will have to accept any arrangement come to between Berlin and “ London . . . and that we perhaps could secure a more satisfactory “ arrangement by unofficial pourparlers with Germany.” He understood that the German Ambassador (Baron Marschall), who was just going to Berlin, would speak in this sense. To these facts, which are all that are available, must be added the consideration, already mentioned, that it is in Germany’s interest that the Gulf section should be built, and she is therefore not likely to place unnecessary difficulties in the way of anyone who will find the money. It is, indeed, probable that she will ask a quid pro quo. Whether her demand will be excessive cannot be known until it is made. But it will doubtless be a matter for bargaining, and in any case it is a question whether it is not better to pay Germany for something that is worth having, than Turkey for something that is not. Turkey .—The Turkish attitude may possibly lie hostile. For positive information we have only M. Gwinner’s statement quoted above. But it is known that Turkey is very suspicious of British designs in Mesopotamia, and she will doubtless prefer an international control because of the scope which it affords for the time-honoured policy of playing off the various Powers against one another. On the other hand, (1) it is strongly to her interest that the line should be built; (2) Sir G. Lowther in his Despatch No. 328, of 12 th May 1911, has given reasons why she need not herself claim a large share ; (3) she will not necessarily be worse off if we obtain 50 per cent, than under her own proposal. She is content now to ask for 25 per cent., and our proposal will leave her to divide 50 per cent, with Germany on the best terms she can get. Nevertheless, let it be assumed that she will object. The considerations advanced above are intended to show that no harm will result if, as a consequence, the Bagdad-Basra Railway question is withdrawn from the present negotiations. It is submitted that His Majesty’s Government would have a very good case for withdrawing it. Their own attempts to find a solution will three times have failed, and it is not reasonable to expect them to go on making overtures to Turkey indefinitely. The Turkish repre sentatives, at the private conferences which preceded the official reply, made a great point of the fact that it was to oblige Great Britain that Turkey had induced the Germans to renounce their rights. It will now be for His Majesty’s Government, while expressing thanks for this sign of good will, to regret that they do not see their way to accept the concession on the terms on which it is offered. We should say that we have shown our own goodwill by making three attempts to meet the Turkish wishes ; we will give a still further proof of it now by withdrawing all objections to the construction of the railway as far as Basra, by any one to whom they choose to entrust it, on the sole condition that they conclude with us a thoroughly satisfactory settlement on the Shat-el-Arab and in the Gulf (including Mohammera), in return for which we will further give them the increase of Customs duties.s It is submitted that we may then fairly expect a full satisfaction of the demands made in the memorandum of 29th July 1911 without the necessity of contemplating any further concessions. But it is at least open to argument that the Turks will not carry their objection to the 50 per cent, arrangement to the point of letting the negotiations break down :— (1.) As has been urged above, it is important to them that the railway should be made. (2.) They know that, whatever may be the value to us of Turkish friend ship, the value to themselves of our friendship is much greater, and if brought gently but firmly up to the point, it is likely that they will think twice before sacrificing it. VII. The procedure to be adopted now .—If the above views, which are only a development of those expressed in India Office letters of 3rd and 29th March 1911, are accepted, the doubt arises whether it is worth while to press for the 50 per cent, at all; whether it is not better to abandon the railway altogether, and devote ourselves entirely to the river and the Gulf, on the lines suggested above. But if it be decided that an attempt should be made to secure 50 per cent., the next question is how. This is really a question for the Foreign Office. The India Office have suggested that we should go direct to the German Government, and the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911 recommended that a confidential conference should be held with the authorities of the Bagdad Railway as a preliminary to further negotiations with Turkey. If it is held to be impossible to go to Germany independently of Turkey, the only course is apparently to inform the Turks that their own proposals being quite inaceeptable, we find ourselves unable to negotiate on the basis of the German declaration of 7th March 1911, but that if they choose to approach Germany with a view to modifying this declaration so as to give us 50 per cent, and the casting vote, we will use our good offices with Germany and be willing to discuss with her the terms of a settlement on those lines, on the understanding that Turkey concludes an entirely satisfactory arrange ment with us in the river and Gulf. VIII. The alternative .—It is necessary to consider the possibility that if we take either of the lines suggested, the Turks will break off the negotiations altogether, as regards both the railway and the Gulf. It is not thought likely, for the reasons suggested under head VI. that this will happen, though they may hint at it by way of bluff. But if they did, it would seem that we should be morally in a very strong position if we could come before the public and say. “We have made every effort to meet the Turks over the “ question of this railway, but without success. But we do not wish to block “ it if we can get a settlement of vexatious questions in the Gulf. We have “ accordingly offered them a free hand for the railway as far as Basra “(beyond which, if it is ever made, it will never pay) and the increased &lt; “ customs duties in return for a recognition de jure of the position in the “ Gulf which we have held de facto for a century ; and they have refused.” Our policy would then be the maintenance, by force if necessary, of that position. We should have to reckon with Turkish hostility both to ourselves&lt;1 nd to the Sheikhs of Ivoweit and Mohammerci. J he kind of measures which we should take are indicated in the Government of India’s letter No. 24 of 15th February 1912’ ::: ’ ; and, if driven to it, we should declare a Protectorate over Koweit. The strength or weakness of our position would then depend largely on the state of our relations with Germany. But it would seem that Germany would have no ground for taking exception to our action if we could tell her that we had been (and still were) anxious to make an arrange ment with her, but had found the Turks so irreconcilable that they would not even accept the free hand for the railway which we had offered them. This contingency is mentioned merely for the sake of completeness. It is almost incredible that it should occur at a time when more than for many years past Turkish interests clamour for the goodwill of Great Britain. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade has read and agrees with all the above remarks. A. H. India Office, 6 th June 1912. APPENDIX. From Viceroy, 29th May 1912. Private. Your private telegram dated 25th instant. Bagdad Railway. From an Indian point of view there can be no possible doubt whatever as to relative advantages of the two proposals. We infinitely prefer the proposal for a 50 per cent, participation for ourselves in the Gulf section, leaving the remainder for disposal as Turkey may wish. We have always felt a 20 or 25 per cent, participation must necessarily involve a loss of prestige in regions adjoining Persian Gulf (see secret telegram of 23rd March 1911), and that it might possibly become necessary some day to give compensation to France and Russia elsewhere for their continued support of our interests in Mesopotamia. With a 50 per cent, share we can make practically sure against differentiation in rates. In considering all questions affecting Mesopotamia, it is advisable to bear in mind that the situation is a fluid one, and it is difficult to foresee what the position there may be in 20 years’ time. Careful as we should therefore be to do all in our power to consolidate our own position and to establish a lien for the future, we feel strongly that no concession in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our position of predominance in the Gulf where we are able and should continue to be able to assert ourselves in maintaining it against all comers. * * i.e., removal of Turkish light vessel, buoys, &amp;c. ; ejection of Turks from Bubiyan and El Katr (including El Bidaa) ; occupation of Fao.r lo on this subject, please quote In any further communication © no. 10818/13.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 119 of to-day’s date, I have the honour to furnish you with the following further details on the subject of the Bagdad Railway Company’s suggestion for the formation of a permanent river transport company in which Messrs. Lynch, the Ottoman Nahrie Company, and the Bagdad Bailway would participate on equal terms. It appears that the company formed in Belgium (see Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 675 of the 8 th August last) by agreement between Messrs. Lynch and the railway company has proved inadequate for the work of carrying up the machinery and materiel during the period of construction of the railway, which is consequently threatened with serious delay. The German company, however, is unwilling to provide the capital for the purchase of additional steamers which would be left idle on their hands at the end of three years or must be sold at a serious loss to the Turkish company. Messrs. Lynch cannot take them, as their fleet on the river is limited to three working vessels. To remedy this state of affairs, and also in order to obtain a permanent interest in the river-borne trade, which is of importance to them as a feeder to the railway, the German company have approached the Turkish Minister of Finance with an outline of the scheme, and have also submitted it to Messrs. Lynch, who, Sir B. Crawford understands, have given it a not unfavourable reception. The lurkish Ministry of Finance has made no definite reply, and will certainly, before doing so, consult Sir B. Crawford. I am not aware of the precise nature of the proposal made by Herr Gunther to Messrs. Lynch, but presumably as a commercial proposition they offer substantial attractions. Still, I venture to suggest that it might be to their advantage to refrain from any binding engagements until some settlement of the Bagdad Bailway and Persian Gulf questions has been reached, which might place them in a position to increase the number of their vessels on the Tigris, and would thus enable them to obtain better terms in negotiating the formation of the new company. It does not appear that Messrs. Lynch’s interests would suffer by a certain delay, as the life of the company formed in Belgium has still some three years to run. Herr Gunther’s proposal of course involves the disappearance from the river of the flag and of a distinctive British concern, a result which may be expected to recommend the scheme to the Ottoman Government. I think also that we must be prepared for the possibility, and indeed the probability, that the German company will eventually acquire Messrs. Lynch’s interests in the projected company.

In this connection I am to advert to the concluding paragraph of your letter of the 25th November last, in which you informed the Secretary of State that His Majesty’s Government might rest assured that you would not fail to consult this department at an early stage in the event of your contemplating any change in the basis of the negotiations with the Turkish Government, or of your being approached by other parties with a view to effecting a change in the status quo on the Tigris. In the light of this assurance, and in the absence of any intimation to the contrary, Sir E.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to Foreign Office.—(Received February 19.) WE learn from the press that Hakki Pasha is now on a visit to London with a mission from the Turkish Government to His Majesty’s Government. It will be within your recollection that his Excellency succeeded Hilmi Pasha as Grand Vizier when the latter was obliged to resign office, partly owing, it was said at the time, to the friendly attitude which he had adopted towards the proposals for a fusion of the steam-ship interests on the Tigris, which were receiving the support of His Majesty’s Government. Upon assuming the office of Grand Vizier, Hakki Pasha reversed the policy of his predecessor in this respect, and the fusion proposals were abandoned. It is unnecessary to remind you of the great trouble and expense to which our company was put in connection with these protracted negotiations. The work which devolved upon His Majesty’s Foreign Office and upon the British Embassy in Constantinople was also considerable. The failure of the negotiations had, moreover, a very prejudicial effect upon British interests in general in that part of the world and upon the interests of this company in particular. Under these circumstances my board feel it to be their duty respectfully to suggest to His Majesty’s Government that, if his Excellency were to leave this country without having received from His Majesty’s Government any indication to the contrary, lie might carry away with him the impression that His Majesty’s Government had not attached much importance to the failure of these British proposals. The moment may not now be opportune for reopening the negotiations. Upon that point my board are reluctant to express an opinion, as they are unaware of the scope of his Excellency’s mission. But, since his Excellency is now engaged on an official mission to His Majesty’s Government, we trust that he may be able to convince himself personally of the importance which is attached here to an early and a satisfactory solution of the steam-ship question on the Tigris. ^STATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

SIR LOUIS MALLET, en presentant ses compliments a son Altesse Hakki Pacha, a Phonneur de lui faire parvenir ci-joint un aide-memoire relatif a la navigation fluviale en Mesopotamie. Foreign Office, le 26 fevrier, 1913. Enclosure in No. 1. Aide-memoire communicated to Hakki Pasha. THE British claim to exceptional rights of navigation on the rivers of Mesopotamia, such as are not enjoyed by any other nation, is based on the following, amongst other, considerations, which are clearly borne out by the records in the possession of His Majesty’s Government:— 1. That British vessels have traded with Turkish Arabia from the 17th century; that a British factory was established at Bussorah in 1639-40 with the sanction of the Turkish Pasha; and that from this date British trade has been carried on by British vessels and boats, under their national flag, on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. 2. That British vessels have from very early times (1761, &amp;c.), and at the express and reiterated requests of successive Pashas of Bagdad, repeatedly assisted the Turkish local authorities in their warlike operations against internal and external enemies, and have rendered the navigation of the rivers more secure. 3. That Government vessels (under the British flag) have been attached to the British residency at Bagdad from 1820, or earlier. 4. That at that period, and for many years before, British subjects were employing their own boats in the trade between Bussorah and Bagdad under the British flag, as is shown by the terms of the letter addressed by the Pasha of Bagdad to the British Resident at that place in 1823. In this letter he stated, inter alia, that “ no tax except one previously well defined and arranged should be levied on boats the property of British subjects and proteges, such, for instance, as pass between Bussorah and Bagdad ” ; he also stated that their boats should not be seized for the public service. 5. That in 1846 an agreement was concluded between the British Ambassador (Sir Stratford Canning) and the Porte whereby the time-honoured right of British vessels to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers was explicitly and formally recognised. It is quite evident, and, indeed, altogether beyond dispute, from the precise and categorical reports furnished by Sir Stratford Canning on the conclusion of this agreement, that both his Excellency and the Sublime Porte regarded at the time the agreement of 1846 as a definite and permanent settlement of the conditions under which British merchant-ships, without limitation as to numbers, might navigate the Tigris and Euphrates as far as they could find water. It is equally evident that the agreement was the recognition of a right which British ships, in distinction to ships of any other nation, had in practice enjoyed, with short intermission, for well nigh two centuries ; that, moreover, they had acquired this right partly in consequence of the great and necessary services rendered during a long series of years by British agency in the maintenance of security in those regions. Sir Stratford Canning gave the purport of the agreement of 1846 as follows :— “ That, whereas British-owned boats had for many years carried on the internal trade on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates under the British flag and without payment of dues, they should in future pay the. same dues as the native-owned boats engaged in the same trade.” .--'-V. v^ [2808 cc—1]The agreement was based upon a memorandum communicated by Sir S. Canning to the Porte, which clearly laid down the terms on which he claimed that British vessels should navigate the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, whether engaged in the external or internal trade. The memorandum was submitted by the Turkish Government to the Grand Douanier who, in a report which was communicated by the Grand Vizier to Sir S. Canning, recapitulated and explained the memorandum in terms agreeing with the views expressed by Sir S. Canning in his despatch. These two documents were embodied in the vizierial letter which received the sanction of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, and was accepted by Sir S. Canning, thus constituting an agreement of a binding and formal nature. These three documents are included in an appendix, which is annexed hereto for convenience of reference. There can be no doubt as to the interpretation of these documents, for they were subsequently twice submitted to expert legal investigation of a most searching character, with the result that the conclusions arrived at by Sir Stratford Canning in 1846 were unreservedly confirmed. The foregoing summary clearly shows that His Majesty’s Government would be justified, both on historical and legal grounds, in claiming for British vessels unlimited rights of navigation on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. They feel confident, therefore, that the Turkish Government will not fail to recognise the extreme moderation which characterised their recent proposal that the number of British merchant-vessels navigating those rivers should be permanently limited to six, a proposal which was put forward without prejudice, but with the desire to effect a final settlement based on a compromise.

Lynch Brothers, at Bagdad, respecting the present arrangements with the Societe de Transports fluviaux en Orient, for the transport of the Bagdad Railway material. The agreement signed between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Societe de Transports is for the carriage of a quantity not exceeding 150,000 tons of railway material from Bussorah to Bagdad in four years, of which the Bagdad Railway Company guarantees to provide a minimum quantity of 100,000 tons in three years, at the following rates :— 100.000 tons in 36 months at 8 s. 9d. per ton ; or 120.000 tons in 48 months at 10s. per ton ; or 130.000 tons in 48 months at 9s. per ton. This freight is to be paid to the Societe de Transports, who are to provide five tugs and eighteen barges for the purpose, and lease them to the railway company under article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Convention. The railway company have appointed Messrs. Lynch Brothers their managing agents to work the fleet and forward the material. By agreement between Messrs. Lynch Brothers and the Bagdad Railway Company, Messrs. Lynch Brothers undertake to forward from 2,500 to 3,500 tons per mensem, and the railway company agrees to always keep 4,000 tons ready for them. The transhipment of the material from the ocean steamers at Bussorah is to be effected by Messrs. Robert Wdnckhaus and Co., at Is. lid. per ton, but if they are unable to carry out this arrangement, Messrs. Lynch Brothers contract to do the work at 2s. 3d. per ton. Messrs. Lynch Brothers act in the matter solely as agents for the Bagdad Railway Company for the transport of the material and the service of the vessels and barges, and will receive the sum of 14s. per ton of cargo carried for the administration, up-keep, and management of the vessels, and this sum includes the cost of stores, coal, and all expenses. The cargo and all plant and material imported for forwarding [2732 s—5]2 it is admitted duty free into Turkey. If 150,000 tons are not provided, they receive as follows :— For 100,000 tons in 36 months at 14.9. 6d. per ton ; or 120.000 tons in 48 months at 14s. 6d. per ton ; or 130.000 tons in 48 months at 14s. 3cZ. per ton. - The Bagdad Railway Company guarantees to provide a minimum quantity of 100,000 tons in three years. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. have to tranship the material from the ocean steamers and deliver it to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, as agents for the Bagdad Railway Company. The fleet is at present to kept quite separate from Messrs. Lynch Brothers’ river steamers, although Mr. Tod hinted confidentially that attempts to bring about a fusion might be made later. The vessels and barges of the Societe de Transports fluviaux will not proceed down river lower than the Bagdad Railway material depot at Maghil, which is about 4 miles above Bussorah. The agreement is to start from the 1st February, 1913, and until that date private arrangements have been made between the Bagdad Railway Company and Messrs. R. Wdnckhaus and Co. for forwarding the material. This is being done, I understand, through the present river steamer services. Messrs. R. Wonckhaus withdraw from these operations on the 31st January, 1913, and the new r arrangement then begins. The fleet, as stated, will consist of five tugs and eighteen barges. The first tug arrived on the 27th October ; others are due on the 13th March, 13th April, and 13th May, and the fifth is to arrive in six months time of the last-mentioned date. Of the barges, two arrived on the 27th October, four are due on the 1st December, and three are to arrive on the 1st of each month up to April 1913. Mr. Tod informed me that up to date about 1,500 tons of railway material have been sent up to Bagdad by Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. I have, &amp;c. F. E.

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th June, transmitting copies of proposed agreements for the transport of material for the Bagdad Kail way Company. The Board do not see anything in the terms of these agreements to which in their opinion His Majesty’s Government need take exception. In this connection, however, I am to say that they are at present uncertain how far the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch) are entitled to put forward a claim for the working of the three additional British boats on the Tigris, the concession for which it is the intention of His Majesty’s Government to ask the Turkish Government to grant. They would therefore be glad if they could be informed confidentially as to the nature of the understanding which exists between your department and Messrs. Lynch, and as to the rights which Messrs. Lynch may have secured in respect of the navigation of both rivers. So far as is consistent with existing rights and obligations, the Board are disposed to suggest that the additional boats to be put on the Tigris should not necessarily be placed under Messrs. Lynch’s control. r ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [July 20.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [30763] No. 1 Board of Trade to Foreign Office .— (Received July 20.) I am, &amp;c. GEO. J. STANLEY.

(Confidential.) 3, Salters' Hall Court, Cannon Street, London, Sir, November 25, 1912. / I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant / with reference to steam-ship enterprise on the Tigris. Mr. H. F. B. Lynch visited the Foreign Office on Thursday last and placed before Messrs. Maxwell and Parker all that is known by my board and by myself on the subject of your letter. The board of the Belgian company, in which we are equal shareholders with the Deutsche Bank, have not had under their consideration the question of amalgamating their enterprise with the line of steam-ships maintained by the Turkish Government. As you will see, it is provided in the agreements constituting the Belgian company, formed for the purpose of conveying the material of the Bagdad Bailway Company, that is shall be open to the Turkish Government to take one-third share enterprise, in which case the present company, registered in Brussels, mayr have to take the form of a Turkish company with the same objects. As regards the proposals which you inform us have been laid before the Secretary • of State for the absorption by a Belgian group of the Turkish Government steamers and for the amalgamation of the other steam-ship interests on the Tigris, we have not been approached in this matter, though we have heard privately that something of the kind is on foot under the auspices of the National Bank of Turkey. We should not favour a combination of this kind. It will be within your recollection that this company have spent a considerable amount of money—and its directors have exerted great and protracted personal efforts—in conducting negotiations with the Turkish Government, at the instance of His Majesty’s Government, for the purpose of consolidating and improving the steam-ship service on the Tigris. These negotiations were brought to the state of completion ; but the Turkish Government withdrew at the last moment, it is believed owing to the opposition of German diplomacy at Constantinople. Under these circumstances and as this company is able to find all the necessary capital, we trust that His Majesty’s Government will abstain from favouring the introduction of British capital from other sources to the detriment of the interests of this company. His Majesty’s Government may rest assured that we should not fail to consult our Foreign Office at an early stage in case we should contemplate any change in the basis of the negotiations with the Turkish Government to which we have referred, or in case we should be approached by other parties with a view to effecting a change in the status quo on the Tigris. At the same time we should be obliged if His Majesty’s Government would keep us informed at an early stage of any contemplated changes which come to their notice, or in case His Majesty’s Government should at any time consider the moment favourable for negotiation with the Turkish Government.

BOARD OP TRADE, (Comnercial Dep&amp;rtmant), GWYDYR HOUSE, TOITEHALL, LONDON, S.W. October 31st, 1912. 3ir:- I ora directed by the Board of Trade to acknov/ledge the receipt of your ’letters of the 23rd and 26th October (Number 44554), enclosing copy of a letter from Sir H. Babington Smith relative to a proposed combination for the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers; and to offer the follov/lng observations thereon for Sir E. Grey’s consideration. So far as the information contained in Sir H. Babington Smith’s letter enables the Board to form an opinion, the effect of the proposed arrangement would seem to be that the Euphrates ana Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company, which is at present an independent and essentially British undertaking, would be absorbed by an international Company in v/hich British Interests would certainly not be predominant, and might even be in a subordinate position. All possibility of River freights he Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.freights being reduced os a result of competition would therefore be liable to be eliminated if the ar rangement should be concluded. The new Company would presumably be registered in Turkey, or, in any event, not in the United Kingdom. The Board understand that the concession under which the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company operate was in fact granted not to the Company, but to His tejesty’s Government; but they presume that, should the proposed combination be formed with the approval (expressed or implied) of His Majesty's Government, the latter would not thereafter be able to claim the rights under that concession for any other undertaking, however unsatisfactory the operations of the new Company might prove to be from the point of view of British interests. The Board have always attached very great import ance to the retention of the full rights of His Majes ty's Government in respect of the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris and their exercise by an inde pendent British concern, and they think this the more necessary now in view of the necessity for maintaining a competing means of communication wioh that of the BagdadBagdad Railway Company. They would accordingly suggost that Sir H.Babington Sialth should he Informed that as at present advised His Majesty's Government cannot view the proposal with favour.

Sir:- i o \ o 4 1 4 ,.C I beg leave to submit for Secretary Sir Edward Grey*s information and consideration certain matters relating to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, which I mentioned to him on the 17th instant. A Belgian Company has recently been formed by Messrs. Lynch and the Deutsche Bank for steam naviga tion on the Tigris - primarily with a view to the conveyance of material for the Bagdad 'Railway. It is, however, probably the intention of the parties who have formed this Company, to negotiate with the Government for the amalgamation of their enterprise with the line of steamships maintained by the Turkish Government. At the same time, a Belgian Group has been in negotiation with the Ottoman Government for the forma tion of a new Company, in 'which the existing Government navigation ^ Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.navigation enterprise would be absorbed. If this negotiation should be s ccessful, the National Bank of Turkey would have the opportunity of taking a large interest in the business. \ It has been suggested that these various interests should combine, and that a Group should be formed consisting of - essrs. Lynch, the National Bank of Turkey, the Deutsche Bank and the Belgian Group, each of the four members having one-fourth share in the capital; and that this combination should negotiate with the Turkish Government to form an Ottoman Com pany, in which the Government would have an interest, for the purpose of taking over the steamers at present owned by the Government, as well as those owned by Messrs. Lynch and the Deutsche Bank. We are not aware at present whether Messrs. Lynch are inclined to enter into a combination of the kind indicated; but, if that should be the case, it appears to us that the basis suggested is one which we might find acceptable. Before proceeding further in the matter, we should esteem it a favour if we could be informed whetherns whether Sir Edward Grey sees any objection to the proposed arrangements; and whether the British members of the Group might expect to receive the support of His Majesty’s Government in negotiations with the Ottoman Government. I am &amp;c., (Signed) H. Babington Smith.116 CONFIDENTIAL. 1. HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated hy the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Bailway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Bailway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Bailway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw tiieir request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the Q un _ exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. vention (b.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty's (^nnex 2). [818] ' B'9 Draft Con vention ( Annex 3.) Annex 4. Memo randum (Annex Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the c msrmction or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (&lt;?.) A convention to he signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. . . , i i (y ^ Permission to l)e given for three British steamers to ns/vigcite-between xjrigdHd and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7 . His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Impeiial Ottoman ? Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit ; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by His Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the loth April. 8. His Majesty’s Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the etf'ect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9 ’The orio-inal despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readilv be produced for the inspection of the Tuikish Embassy. ^ # ' 10. His Majesty’s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they haw? never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. _ .... ... H JJig Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. Thev have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition he memoran( lum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government ot the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of3 divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their pc hey in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would he alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed H is Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right hut the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess ot‘ Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; [b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and ho the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to IBs Majesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question laid been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on' the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. Memo randum (Annex 5'&gt; 5 ANNEX 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

Di aft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-cl-Arab Navigation Commission. . Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the feultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, .and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows :— . 1* U 16 navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all nations. 1 2. The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. I he Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £ T. 2,000 free of all deductions. T hese salaries shall be paid by the Commission. i u’ C r missi ° n a PP°i n t Sll ch officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. I he Commission shall be charged with the following duties :— (u.) Hie execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (h.) the maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. &gt; ( c '). peeparatioa, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (r/.) The control of pilotage. (c.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/•) supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of t i is com ention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. J 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. J7 In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. I he Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall he exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton shipping. 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall he no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 1 &amp; 11. Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be advanced by the high contracting parties at Cerate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 12. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 13. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. 14. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its ordinary expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 15. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should he carried out, the question shall he referred by them to an engineer of repute, to he agreed upon by the commissioners, or, ^ failing agreement, to be nominated by the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall he adopted by the Commission. 1G. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities. 17. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, buildings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the discharge of their duties by the otficers of the police, pilotage, or other services maintained by the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 18. 1 he transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect the territorial jurisdiction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction, nor shall anything in this Convention he deemed to give the Commission power to exercise jurisdiction or to carry out duties or to hold land outside the limits of the Ottoman Empire without the consent of the territorial Power, or to affect the operation or the interpretation of the provisions of any treaty or arrangement prescribing or defining the limits of the said Empire. 1 9. This agreement shall be binding during twenty-one years from the day of its signature. In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years, of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. [SIS] D8 ANNEX 4. Kowe it HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na’airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Badaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. Districts and Islands .—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, tails naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Riqa’i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra’ab Adan, Salu, Ha^aim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Koweit. ANNEX a. Mohammerah Frontier. HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which wns not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-ehArab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants.These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which lias been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Mania ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ijjso facto, the frontier of Persia : in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “ Ilawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 18(58), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent‘chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it as a pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha .should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bo warm, and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid ; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark ; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the^ Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs.10 The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous Stales, the middle of the channel or “thalweg” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession ” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (18471 as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia :— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh. (ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. (iii.) r J’he modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily eoAmred with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing 'proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory. o/3 This document is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. Secret. Bagdad-Basra Railway. I. The present position. —At the interdepartmental conference of 30th March 1911, Sir E. Grey proposed that vve should ask for 50 per cent, participation, and a memorandum for the Turkish Government was prepared on this basis. On the 7th April 1911 the Board of Trade wrote that there were “only two practicable policies” (1) “to participate in the working of the southern section on terms of equality with Germany, but to the “ exclusion of all third parties as regards control,” and (2) to refuse participation altogether. No further communications passed between the departments on this subject, but on J 2th July 1911 a draft memorandum to the Turkish Government was privately communicated to the India Office. This memorandum contained the proposal, which was actually made to the Turkish Ambassador on 29th July 1911, that Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, and Turkey, should participate at the rate of 20 per cent, each, and that a convention should be drawn up precluding differential rates on all the railways of Asia Minor. The Turkish Government replied on 15th April 1912, not expressly rejecting this proposal, but substituting 25 per cent, participation for Great Britain, France, Germany, and Turkey, to the exclusion of Russia. But in the private discussions that preceded the despatch of this reply the Turkish representatives more than once stated in the strongest terms their objection, on political grounds, to the inclusion of Russia, and said that if His Majesty’s Government pressed it they would be obliged to insist on the admission of Switzerland. This His Majesty’s Government would of course not be able to accept, for it would strengthen the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest at our expense. Russia, it will be borne in mind, has said that, while she only wants to help us, she wants to be admitted if France is admitted. The Turkish counter-proposal of 15th April 1912 is therefore not a mere modification of our own, but, in effect, a complete rejection of it. A new situation is thus created, and it is submitted that in the circumstances His Majesty’s Government are bound to consider it on its merits, and that it is possible for us, without doing any violence to diplomatic conventions, or giving any just cause of offence to Turkey, to treat our proposal of 29th July 1911 as completely out of court, and to substitute for it a better one, if such can be found. It may be conceded that as we have actually proposed the admission of France and Russia our position is no longer as strong as it was for proposing their omission. But here the Turks have fortunately helped us. For if Russia insists on participating in the event of French participation, while Turkey will admit France but not Russia, the result is a deadlock of which the only solution is the omission of both. The following considerations are intended to show that the proposal of 29th duly 1911 should not be pressed, and that the terms which Sir E. Grey originally wished to put forward are, as the Board of Trade held, the only ones on which we should now consent to participate. II. The objections to the last proposals made by His Majesty's Govern ment .—The view underlying those proposals is that, provided we can secure S. 159. atl .«:mm 2 a convention absolutely precluding differential rates on the whole of the Bagdad Railway system, the degree of our participation in the Gulf section is immaterial, and that it is in fact worth our while to purchase the convention by abating our claims to participation. The objections are :— (a) That no convention can absolutely preclude differentiation or the application of those advantages which Protectionist countries accord their trade. This is in effect the Board of Trade view also. (b) That the Bagdad Railway Convention already does so, a^ far as any convention can. See Article 24 of the Cahier des Charges : “ tons “ les tarifs, qu’ils soient generaux, speciaux, ou proportionnels on “ differentiels, sont applicables a tons les voyageurs et expediteurs “ sans distinction.” This applies to the Bagdad-Khanikin branch (Article 1 of the Convention), and to the Alexandretta concession, which is given on the same terms as the Convention of 1003 except where otherwise specified. (c) Differential rates are not the only risk involved in absence of effective control. The Bagdad Railway Committee in its report of 26th March 1907, quoted Sir James Mackay’s opinion that the Company, if under “ a management of which this country exercised no “ influence or control ” “ would lose no time in establishing a line “ of steamers from the terminus to Bombay, and in course of time “ they would virtually monopolize the entire trade between India “ and the Persian Gulf, because it would be impracticable for the “ British lines to compete against the ships supported by the “ Railway Company, which would give through bookings and “ through rates for passengers and cargo.” This danger would, exist the moment that the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest preponderated over the British interest, i.e., the moment the latter was less than 50 per cent. Again, there is the risk (referred to in the same report) that the “ Railway Company will make it their business to cut the freights “ between Basra and Bagdad, so as to be able to compete with the “ river-borne traffic,” that is to say, the Bagdad Railway Company, if preponderant on the Gulf section, will drive the steamers off the river, and then raise the rates on the railway. They will not, of course, be able to do so beyond the point at which it will pay to put the steamers back on the river. But in order that we may be ready to take advantage of that moment when it comes it will be necessary that the steamers shall be there, which probably means paying Messrs. Lynch or someone else a subsidy to keep them efficient, though idle—another charge on the revenue of the Gulf Section before it can pay a dividend. (d) The Gulf section being the shortest necessarily determines the rates on the northern section to Bagdad. It is therefore our interest to have as free a hand as possible on that section. Therefore a convention applicable to the whole Bagdad Railway system is a positive disadvantage to us. (e) It is our interest to have as free a hand as possible because it is essential to prevent the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest from getting the preponderance. This is not sufficient!}^ secured by the 20 per cent, participation, since we cannot depend on the permanence3 I2X in all circumstances of the entente, commercially and financially (French finance, for example, is notoriously beyond the control of its Government); while politically it may he a serious source of weakness elsewhere (as pointed out by the Ahceroy in his telegram of 29th May— see Appendix) that we should have important commercial interests hound up with the permanence of the entente in Mesopotamia. (/) As a financial proposition it is to be feared that 20 per cent, in an international railway 350 miles long costing less than 3,000,000L to construct, will not he considered worth looking at. On the other hand the facts that (1) the German Company has first of all to he compensated ; (2) rolling stock has to he provided and ports to he built; (3) the expenses of international management will be unnecessarily heavy; (4) the railway will have no prospect of paying for many years (until, in fact, Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed); (5) in the meantime there will be no guarantee (for it may he taken as certain that the Government of India, at all events, will give no guarantee) ; will he further disastrous to its flotation. The British share will simply not he taken up : and where is the Russian share to come from, when the Russian Government cannot find money for its favoured project, the Trans- Persian Railway, and Russian unofficial finance is concentrated on that enterprise ? (g) If, therefore, participation on these terms is of no value as a financial proposition, and if we have not sufficient control to prevent the Bagdad Railway interest from preponderating, there is no apparent commercial advantage in participation over non-participation. (h) The Gulf section would be a most valuable political asset if it were all British. It would still be valuable if it were British controlled, but it loses in value by leaps and bounds as British participation diminishes, until a point is reached where prestige will suffer less and dignity be better consulted if the country which owns 70 per cent, of the trade and 85 per cent, of the shipping stands aloof altogether, rather than participates on an equality with three other Powers who have practically no material stake in the country at all. (?) Xo attempt has been made to show how the joint arrangement is to work in practice, e.g., is the actual working agency to be international, and is it seriously thought that that would be workable ? Again, in order that the commercial interests of the line may be effectively safeguarded, it must be worked independently of, and to some extent in opposition to, the Bagdad Railway : but it is extremely doubtful whether any arrangement with this object would be found workable in practice. III. The view therefore supported is that of the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911—that the only alternatives are to participate on a 50 per cent, basis (to which it should be added that, in that case, the Chairman must be British), or not to participate at all. (a) The view that British control on the Gulf section is useless without a convention to prevent differential rates on the rest of the sj^stem has already been dealt with. It has also been pointed out thatby controlling the shortest section we should, in fact, control the rates over the German section. It may further be urged that the sole effect to the Bagdad Railway Company of imposing differential rates against British goods between Alexandretta and Bagdad would be to send British trade round to the Basra-Bagdad line. With 50 per cent., the casting vote on the Board, and a free hand as regards rates, our position would, therefore, be impregnable'. (b) What would it be if we did not participate at all ? It must be premised that from the British and Indian point of view it is better that the railway should not be built. It must be remembered that there is no analogy between the position now and the position in 1903. Then we might have had substantial participation in the whole length of the railway, which would, besides, have admitted us to the exploitation of a new country. Now we are offered 20 per cent, in a branch 350 miles long, which will admit other Powers on equal terms with us to the exploitation of a country of whose trade we already have 70 per cent. Politically. —The construction of the railway means the military and administrative consolidation of Turkey in Mesopotamia, with an increased tendency to seek influence in the Persian Gulf, and to extend control in Arabia, and an increased power of offensive against British interests, including Koweit and Mohammera. It further means the firmer establishment of German, French, and Russian interests—with a corresponding tendency to intervene—in a region where the outside interests have hitherto been preponderatingly British. (It is not of course suggested that we can, or ought to try to, keep every one else out; but to invite them in, and on such terms, is quite another matter.) Commercially. —Our interests are twofold. There is the existing trade with Western Persia via Bagdad and Khanikin, and the trade which is expected to grow up when Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed. The Persian trade is worth about 2,000,000b It is difficult to forecast its future; but if the Trans-Persian Railway is built, and Mohammera connected with it and with Burujird, the Persian trade will presumably desert Bagdad altogether. If Persian Railways remain in abeyance, it is not clear that we shall be worse off than we are at present, so long as the river between Bagdad and the Gulf is open, and Article 24 of the Cahier des Charges operates to prevent differential rates on the Bagdad Railway. Again, the future local trade of Mesopotamia, being mainly in agricultural products, will probably in any case flow westwards to Alexandretta. This view seems to be borne out by the latest figures available for the trade of Bagdad, 1910, which are as follows :— Imports to Bagdad. £ United Kingdom - - - 1,317,762 France - 203,284 Austria-Hungary - 180,011 Belgium - - 211,835 Germany _ _ _ 53,705 United States of America 806 India, China, and Japan - - 664,1475 Exports from Bagdad. To—United Kingdom France - Austria-Hungary Belgium Germany United States of America - India, China, and Japan £ 330,361 - 132,131 14,501 3,077 30,441 155,049 87,478 The bulk of the British and Indian imports seems to be in cotton goods, twist and woollens, and that of the exports carpets, wool, opium and hides. It is, however, possible that cotton will be grown and pressed in Mesopotamia and will find its way into eastern markets, and the mineral resources of the country (especially oil) may also add to the trade eastwards. But, speaking generally, it does not seem certain that the volume of trade resulting from the development of Mesopotamia will necessitate the construction of the Gulf section if India is not to lose its share, and it is probable that India will retain her share whether it is built or not. But, of course, it is not possible to assume that the railway will never be built. From the difficulty which it is understood that the Germans have hud in disposing of the bonds of the other sections of the Bagdad Railway, and from their willingness to part with their lights in the Gulf section, it may, indeed, be inferred that they will be in no hurry to undertake the latter, while the Turks themselves have neither the money nor the means of obtaining it. The construction will therefore be postponed, but—as the line is of military and political importance to Turkey—it will eventually be built In the interval much may have happened in Mesopotamia, as the Viceroy has reminded us, and it is not easy to foresee the conditions that will then exist. But, supposing that the railway is worked on commercial lines, and that the clause precluding differential tariffs is still operative, it does not appear, from the point of view of our trade, that the fact of our having no share in it will be a disadvantage. But, of course, it may not be run on commercial lines. Protected by their kilometric guarantees the Germans may prefer to let it rust—it would always be available for Turkish military purposes-- and attract all the traffic to the Northern section. In that case, too, , it does not appear that, provided the river were kept free, we should be any worse off commercially than if the line did not exist at all. Politically, no doubt, we should be, because the Turkish consolidation would be effected, and if the railway were built under German auspices, German influence would be brought very near to the Gulf. But provided that we can ensure that the line will not be carried beyond Basra or, if so, only on terms agreeable to Great Britain, and provided that we have in the meantime consolidated our own position in the Gulf, that risk might fairly be taken. The one serious drawback would be that referred to under head (c) on page 2 -the danger of the extinction of the British carrying trade between India and Bagdad. Although this disadvantage might to some extent be compensated by the advantages that might accrue to other branches of trade, it is a very real one and would have to be faced. (It could only be met, apparently, by a corresponding interworking between steamships and railwaycompanies on the Indian side— a matter which would obviously require very careful consideration). Moreover, as has already been pointed out, it is equally attendant upon any arrangement which does not secure to this country effective control of the Gulf section. IV. The importance of the river. —The necessity of keeping the river open has been emphasised throughout these remarks. By that is meant not only ensuring that it is kept properly dredged and navigable, and that no prohibitive dues are placed upon shipping (both of which will be secured, as far as the Shat-el-Arab is concerned, by the separate Convention setting up a Riverain Commission), but also by maintaining the right of navigation as far as Bagdad. This is equally necessary, for the reasons already given, whether we renounce the Railway altogether or participate in it on terms short of effective control. It is therefore essential that the questions should at once be closely examined with a view to ascertaining exactly what rights of navi gation British shipping possesses on the Tigris and Euphrates, and what steps should be taken to put them on a secure basis. V. Conclusions. —The conclusions seem to be— 1. That, if the river is open, it is better for us that the railway should never be built; 2. That it is therefore not our interest to facilitate it except on terms which will make it commercially and politically advantageous to ourselves; 3. That the only terms on which it will be thus advantageous are that we secure effective control, i.e., 50 per cent, participation, the casting vote on the board of management, and a fret' hand as regards rates. 4 That failing that, we should stand out altogether, and con centrate on getting what we want in the Gulf, and especially the joint control with Turkey of the Shat-el-Arab and the right of navigation to Bagdad, which are really the key to the situation. Mr. Brereton (Government Director of Indian Railway Companies) has read and entirely concurs in these remarks so far as they touch on the commercial aspects of the scheme. VI. The practicability of obtaining hi) per cent. —At the interdepartmental conference of 30th March Sir E. Grey had apparently no doubt of this, and he at once proceeded to prepare the ground with France and Russia. France. —Sir E. Grey to Sir F. Bertie, No. 123, of 6th April 1911—“M. “ Gambon . . . had told Count Benckendorff that the question as to “ whether France should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section was one “ which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to “ do so, but she did not regard it as her affair.” Russia.—Sir E. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan, No. 105, of 10th April 1911. Count Benckendorff said that . . . “ the Russian desire was to help “ us, and therefore their proposal [i.e., to participate] would not hold if the “ question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, “ that if it was ultimately decided to have French co-operation, Russia “ should come in too.” The India Office has no later information than this.&lt; Germany .—The India Office has not heard of any overtures to Germany on the subject. We know only that in 1909 M. Gwinner informed Sir E. Cassel that the Germans had no objection to Great Britain obtaining more than 50 per cent., and that it was from Hussein Hilmi that the opposition then came. Further, in 1911, Sir G. Lowther wrote (No. 183, of 22nd March) “ Prominent Germans here have recently been hinting that “ the Turks will have to accept any arrangement come to between Berlin and “ London . . . and that we perhaps could secure a more satisfactory “ arrangement by unofficial pourparlers with Germany.” He understood that the German Ambassador (Baron Marschall), who was just going to Berlin, would speak in this sense. To these facts, which are all that are available, must be added the consideration, already mentioned, that it is in Germany’s interest that the Gulf section should be built, and she is therefore not likely to place unnecessary difficulties in the way of anyone who will find the money. It is, indeed, probable that she will ask a quid pro quo. Whether her demand will be excessive cannot be known until it is made. But it will doubtless be a matter for bargaining, and in any case it is a question whether it is not better to pay Germany for something that is worth having, than Turkey for something that is not. Turkey .—The Turkish attitude may possibly be hostile. For positive information we have only M. Gwinner’s statement quoted above. But it is known that Turkey is very suspicious of British designs in Mesopotamia, and she will doubtless prefer an international control because of the scope which it affords for the time-honoured policy of playing off the various Powers against one another. On the other hand, (1) it is strongly to her interest that the line should be built; (2) Sir G. Lowther in his Despatch No. 328, of 12th May 1911, has given reasons why she need not herself claim a large share ; (3) she will not necessarily be worse off if we obtain 50 per cent, than under her own proposal. She is content now to ask for 25 per cent., and our proposal will leave her to divide 50 per cent, with Germany on the best terms she can get. Nevertheless, let it be assumed that she will object. The considerations advanced above are intended to show that no harm will result if, as a consequence, the Bagdad-Basra Railway question is withdrawn from the present negotiations. It is submitted that His Majesty’s Government would have a very good case fer withdrawing it. Their own attempts to find a solution will three times have failed, and it is not reasonable to expect them to go on making overtures to Turkey indefinitely. The Turkish repre sentatives, at the private conferences which preceded the official reply, made a great point of the fact that it was to oblige Great Britain that Turkey had induced the Germans to renounce their rights. It will now be for llis Majesty’s Government, while expressing thanks for this sign of good will, to regret that they do not see their way to accept the concession on the terms on which it is offered. We should say that we have shown our own goodwill by making three attempts to meet the Turkish wishes ; we will give a still further proof of it now by withdrawing all objections to the construction of the railway as far as Basra, by any one to whom they choose to entrust it, on the sole condition that they conclude with us a thoroughly satisfactory settlement on the Shat-el-Arab and in the Gulf (including Mohammera), in return for which we will further give them the increase of Customs duties. c S. 159.It is submitted that we may then fairly expect a full satisfaction of the demands made in the memorandum of 29th July 1911 without the necessity of contemplating any further concessions. But it is at least open to argument that the Turks will not carry their objection to the 50 per cent, arrangement to the point of letting the negotiations break down :— (1.) As has been urged above, it is important to them that the railway should be made. (2.) They know that, whatever may be the value to us of Turkish friend ship, the value to themselves of our friendship is much greater, and if brought gently but firmly up to the point, it is likely that they will think twice before sacrificing it. YU. The 'procedure to be adopted now .—If the above views, which are only a development of those expressed in India Office letters of 3rd and 29th March 1911, are accepted, the doubt arises whether it is worth while to press for the 50 per cent, at all ; whether it is not better to abandon the railway altogether, and devote ourselves entirely to the river and the Gulf, on the lines suggested above. But if it be decided that an attempt should be made to secure 50 per cent., the next question is how. This is really a question for the Foreign Office. The India Office have suggested that we should ga direct to the German Government, and the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911 recommended that a confidential conference should be held with the authorities of the Bagdad Railway as a preliminary to further negotiations with Turkey. If it is held to be impossible to go to Germany independently of Turkey, the only course is apparently to inform the Turks that their own proposals being quite inacceptable, we find ourselves unable to negotiate on the basis of the German declaration of 7th March 1911, but that if they choose to approach Germany with a view to modifying this declaration so as to give us 50 per cent, and the casting vote, we will use our good offices with Germany and be willing to discuss with her the terms of a settlement on those lines, on the understanding that Turkey concludes an entirely satisfactory arrange ment with us in the river and Gulf. VIII. The alternative.—It is necessary to consider the possibility that if we take either of the lines suggested, the Turks will break off the negotiations altogether, as regards both the railway and the Gulf. It is not thought likely, for the reasons suggested under head VI. that this will happen, though they may hint at it by way of bluff. But if they did, it would seem that we should be morally in a very strong position if we could come before the public and say. “ We have made every effort to meet the Turks over the “ question of this railway, but without success. But we do not wish to block “ it if we can get a settlement of vexatious questions in the Gulf. We have “ accordingly offered them a free hand for the railway as far as Basra “(beyond which, if it is ever made, it will never pay) and the increased “ customs duties in return for a recognition de jure of the position in the “ Gulf which we have held de facto for a century ; and they have refused.” Our policy would then be the maintenance, by force if necessary, of that position. We should have to reckon with Turkish hostility both to ourselves— 9 and to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammera. The kind of measures which we should take are indicated in the Government of India’s letter No. 24 of 15th February 1912 :i: ‘ ; and, if driven to it, we should declare a Protectorate over Koweit. The strength or weakness of our position would then depend largely on the state of our relations with Germany. But it would seem that Germany would have no ground for taking exception to our action if we could tell her that we had been (and still were) anxious to make an arrange ment with her, but had found the Turks so irreconcilable that they would not even accept the free hand for the railway which we had offered them. This contingency is mentioned merely for the sake of completeness. It is almost incredible that it should occur at a time when more than for many years past Turkish interests clamour for the goodwill of Great Britain. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade has read and agrees with all the above remarks. A. H. India Office, 6th June 1912. APPENDIX. From Viceroy, 29th May 1912. Private. Your private telegram dated 25th instant. Bagdad Railway. From an Indian point of view there can be no possible doubt whatever as to relative advantages of the two proposals. We infinitely prefer the proposal for a 50 per cent, participation for ourselves in the Gulf section, leaving the remainder for disposal as Turkey may wish. We have always felt a 20 or 25 per cent, participation must necessarily involve a loss of prestige in regions adjoining Persian Gulf (see secret telegram of 23rd March 1911), and that it might possibly become necessary some day to give compensation to France and Russia elsewhere for their continued support of our interests in Mesopotamia. With a 50 per cent, share we can make practically sure against differentiation in rates. In considering all questions affecting Mesopotamia, it is advisable to bear in mind that the situation is a fluid one, and it is difficult to foresee what the position there may be in 20 years’ time. Careful as we should therefore be to do all in our power to consolidate our own position and to establish a lien for the future, we feel strongly that no concession in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our position of predominance in the Gulf where we are able and should continue to be able to assert ourselves in maintaining it against all comers. * * i.e., removal of Turkish light vessel, buoys, &amp;c. ; ejection of luiks fiom Bubijan and El Katr (including El Bidaa) ; occupation of bao.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

Under article 9 of their concession the Bagdad Railway Company are entitled to carry building materials for railway in their own vessels should they deern that course desirable ; the fact that Messrs.

St. Petersburgh, August 26, 1912, 8'30 p.m. MINISTER for Foreign Affairs read to me to-day a telegram which he had received from Russian charge d’affaires in London on the subject of agreement which Lynch has concluded with German bank. He was, he said, disagreeably surprised to ^ hear that His Majesty’s Government had raised no objections and had treated it as a matter that was of no political importance. After the Potsdam conversations he had been taken severely to task for having agreed not to obstruct construction of Bagdad Railway. He had done so because it was not in the power of Russian Government to prevent line being built. Agreement now signed went much farther, as it directly facilitated the construction of the railway / by placing the Lynch steamers at the disposal of the company for the transport of j railway material. Result would be to accelerate construction of the line, and thus would place Russian Government in a very embarrassing situation. According to Russo-German agreement, they were bound to commence Khanikin-Tehran line within two years from the completion of line from Sadijeh or eventually to allow Germans to construct it. When they signed this agreement they believed that railway would not reach Bagdad for five or six years, but now this period might be considerably shortened. This was a very important side to the question, which, he regretted to say, had escaped the attention of His Majesty’s Government. j 767—909][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's SovemmeBt] r\ ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

In the meantime I am to state that your summary correctly represents the facts, and that it is contemplated that the vessels shall run under the Turkish flag. Further that the incorporation of our company or its service into the new arrangements has not formed a subject of conversation with the Bagdad Railway Company; still less has it formed a subject for consideration. The negotiations have been confined to giving effect to article 9 of the Bagdad Railway concession, which empowers the Bagdad Railway Company to place steamers on the rivers of Mesopotamia for the carriage of railway material, and they have had nothing whatever to do with the status or service of this company.

The Board gather that the operations of the new Syndicate are to be confined to the transport of railway material, or that if permission to carry general cargo be obtained it will be confined to downward cargo at rates not lower than those charged by the steamship companies operating on the Mesopotamian rivers. They also understand that there is no intention of incorporat ing opy- 574. 17619). mediate and Confidential. 1555 e Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.incorporating in the new service that of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, which will continue as a separate undertaking; and that the new fleet will he removed from Turkish internal 'waters so soon as the con struction of the railway is completed, unless some arrangement for its employment is then made with the Turkish Government. These points, however, are not all equally clear and the Board suggest that the Company should be asked to state definitely whether the fore going actually represents the facts. In all the circumstances, and especially in view of the fact that under Article 9 of their concession the Bagdad Hallway Company are entitled to carry build ing and other materials, necessary for railway con struction, in their own boats should they deem that course desirable, the Board are disposed to think that if the foregoing summary is correct. His Majesty's Gov ernment need raise no objection to the general nature of the scheme, which would appear to secure for the United Kingdom a substantial share in this particular carrying trade, and in the construction of the necessary vessels.(0) QjoZ veseele. It does, however, appear to them desirable that an effort should be made to obtain from the Euphrates and Tigris Company an undertaking that they will not transfer the whole or any part of their inter est in the new Company, or in the proposed Anglo-German- Turkish Company, without giving adequate (say six months*) notice to His Majesty*s Government; and that an intimation should be conveyed to the Company that His Majesty’s Government reserve their right to take such action as they may consider necessary should any scheme be put forward for the utilisation of the new fleet in Mesopotamian internal waters after the railway from the North has reached Bagdad. The Euphrates and Tigris Company do not state under what flag the new vessels are to run, and I am to suggest that should Sir E.

Sir: - With reference to your letter of the 3rd Febru ary last on the subject of the Baghdad Railway Com pany and to our reply of the 6th Idem, I have the honour to report that an agreement has been reached between this Company and the Baghdad Railway Company acting through their respective Chairmen, for the transport of the material of the Baghdad Railway Company from Busreh up the rivers of Turkish Arabia. A Syndicate is to be formed at once with regis tration in Belgium; half the capital being held by the Baghdad Railway Company and half by this Company. This Syndicate is to purchase and provide a fleet of steamers and barges at Busreh suitable for the transport by river of railway material; at least half the fleet is to be built in Great Britain. The Syndicate will lease the fleet to the Baghdad Rail way Company, the period of the lease being dependent e Under Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairs. uponupon the time required for constructing the railway, but being provisionally fixed at four years. At its termination, the fleet will be removed from the internal waters of Turkey, unless the Turkish Gov ernment should signify their consent to some scheme for its future employment. The terms of the lease to the Railway Company provide for payment by the latter at a fixed rate per ton of material carried. It is understood that the operations of the fleet will be confined to the carraige of railway material but in the event of permission being given by the Turkish Government to carry general cargo on the downward voyages, it is provided that no lower rate shall be accepted than that current at the time for transport by steamer. The fleet will be worked and managed by the Agents of this Company acting as Agents of the Baghdad Railway Company, and in con cert with the local representative of that Company. The Agreement further provides for the early opening of negotiations with the Turkish Government for the purpose of the conversion of the Syndicate into an Anglo-German-Turkish Company to take over all the assets, liabilities and contracts of the Syndicate. In» ifflf ||g l In the new Company the Baghdad Railway Company, this Company and the Turkish Government are to partici pate equally. It will simply step into the shoes of the Syndicate, take its place and perform its objects. Should it be constituted, the whole of the material of the Baghdad Railway Company will be handed over to it for transport; but in the event of it not being possible to form it, about one-third part of the railway material will be given to the steamers of the existing Turkish river administration. In conveying you this information, I am in structed by my Board to request you to treat it as strictly confidential and to desire His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople to do the same, should the Turkish Government or individuals or firms institute enquiries. Our objects in the negotia tions have been to safeguard the interests of this Company, to maintain the British position on the rivers of Mesopotamia and to secure orders for British industry. That we submit, was no easy task in view of the great power conferred on the Baghdad Railway Company. If, as we hope, those objects have been@ an been attained within the scope of the present nego tiations, and if the way has been paved at the same time for friendly co-operation with German enter prise in these regions ray Board feel that they can count on the approval and support of His Majesty*s Government in the course upon which they have entered for the purpose of the transport of the Railway material.

From Sadidjeh to Khanikin. 4. From Zobeir to a point on the Persian Gulf to be agreed upon between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaires, as well as everything apper taining to the said lines. The main line and its branches shall follow a route to be approved by the Imperial Ottoman Government—to the Ottoman Anatolian Railway Company on the following conditions :— Article 2. The duration of this concession shall be ninety-nine years. A similar period shall be adopted for the lines of Angora and Konia, and shall commence to run from the date of the issue of the firman and the exchange of the present convention. As regards the new lines, this period of ninety-nine years shall commence to run separately for each section from the date on which the Imperial Government shall have issued the Government bonds to the concessionnaires in accordance with article 35 of the present convention. Article 3. These lines, taken collectively, are divided, as regards the submission of the final plans and designs, into sections of 200 kilom. in length. The concessionnaires shall, within three months from the date of the issue of the firman granting the concession and the exchange of the present convention and the specification (and after the conditions of article 35 have been fulfilled), submit to the Ministry of Public Works, after the survey has taken final shape, and in accordance with the terms of the [426] D 338 specification full plans and designs of the first section of 200 kilom. in length, starting from Konia and passing through, or as near as possible to, Karaman and Eregli, i.e., along the contemplated route of the Bagdad line. As regards the other sections the plans and designs relating thereto shall be submitted within eight months from the date on which the concession for each section commences in pursuance of the provisions of article 35 which relate to each section. The plans and designs must be examined by the Ministry, and, according to circumstances, approved as they stand, or modified if necessary, within three months from the date of their submission. After that period, if the Imperial Government have not notified their decision to the concessionnaires, the latter may consider the designs which they have submitted as having been approved, and they shall proceed to put the work in hand. If the Imperial Government introduce such modifications into the designs ps will involve a delay of more than one month in the approval of the plans, the period allowed for construction shall be extended by a period equal to the delay caused by the examination of those modifications and approval of the plans. The special assignments intended for the first section of 200 kilom. starting from Konia and passing through or as near as possible to Karaman and Eregli, are set forth in Annex I (Financial Convention),* which forms an integral part of the present convention. Article 4.

The works must be carried out in accordance with standard practice and the terms of the annexed specifications, as well as with the approved plans and designs ; notwithstanding, in case °f vu major, the periods for completion shall be extended by a period equal to that of the interruption of the work, provided that the concessionnaires immediately notify the local authorities as well as the Ministry of Public Works. The teim vis major shall be understood to include the case of a war between European Powers, as also a radical change in the financial situation of Germany, England, or France. Xl.lt JLlULut. u. Ministry of Public W^orks shall control the works by one or more commissioners both during execution, on completion of the works, and before their reception. This contiol shall likewise apply to the working of the line and the maintenance of the works during the period of concession. ™ i The co 1 n ? essionnaires deposit each year, to the order of the Ministry of Public W orks, and in respect of expenses of control, a sum of 270 gold piastres per kilometre, payable monthly, from the date fixed for the commencement of the works until the termination of the concession. Article 6. The enterprise being of public utility, land necessary tor the building of the railway and everything appertaining thereto, quarries, and gravel-pits for ballast necessary for the railway and belonging to private persons shall be taken over in accordance with the law on expropriation, whenever it has not proved possible to come to an understanding between the concessionnaires and the owners for the purchase of such land.

The temporary occupation of such land during the work of construction shall likewise be granted to them free of charge. Article 7.

Consequently the concessionnaires will be entitled to a nominal sum of 269,110 fr. 65 c. of this State loan for each kilometre constructed and opened to traffic, and the concessionnaires shall be debarred from demanding other amounts on this head from the Imperial Ottoman Government. The total nominal amount of Government bonds accruing to the concessionnaires by the terms of the foregoing arrangement shall be issued to them by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the signature of each special convention for each section; but the con cessionnaires shall make good to the Imperial Ottoman Government the sums which the latter have paid during the period of construction for the service of the bonds issued to the concessionnaires, viz., till the date on which each section of the railway is provisionally accepted. These sums shall be placed by the concessionnaires in the hands of the Public Debt for the account of the Imperial Ottoman Government. The Imperial Government reserve the right of modifying at any moment the system of payment of the kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr. fixed in the first paragraph of the present article, after redemption of the bonds issued in respect of the said annuity.

For the first section of 200 kilom. beyond Konia the face value of the bonds to be issued by the Imperial Ottoman Government to the concessionnaires is fixed at 54 , 000,000 fr. But as soon as this section is finally accepted and the length of the completed line is fixed, the exact nominal value of the bonds accruing to the concession naires for that section shall be calculated at the rate of 269,110 fr. 65 c. per kilometre. Any surplus over this nominal amount shall be calculated at the issue price, plus interest at 4 per cent, accrued up to the date of payment, and the sum thus ascertained shall be paid in cash by the concessionnaires into the Imperial Treasury. The calculation shall be made at a minimum of 81J per cent. The Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company guarantees to the Imperial Ottoman Government the construction of the aforesaid first section of 200 kilom. until the work on this section is completed. In the event of the Imperial Ottoman Government deeming it necessary, they may also require the Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company to guarantee 'other sections, and the Ottoman Anatolian Bailway Company shall have the right so to do. The contract sum of 4,500 fr. per annum for working expenses in respect of each kilometre opened to traffic will be guaranteed to the concessionnaires by a special convention for each section simultaneously with the convention regulating the annuity of 11,000 fr. As regards the first section of 200 kilom. beyond Konia, the above-mentioned contract sum of 4,500 fr. per kilometre per annum is secured to the concessionnaires on the surplus of the guarantees already assigned to the lines of the Ottoman Anatolian Bail way Company. The service of the Government bonds which are to be issued for the aforesaid kilometric annuity of 11,000 fr. shall be secured on the special appropriations agreed on with the Imperial Government before work is begun on each section. The Imperial Ottoman Bagdad Bailway Company, on its part, further pledges, irrevocably and inalienably, to the holders of the said bonds the line from Konia to the Persian Gulf and its branches with their rolling stock. Similarly, and for the same purpose, it assigns its share in the receipts from this line after payment of the working expenses, but the bondholders shall not be entitled to intervene in the administration of the company. The aforesaid share of the receipts, after deducting working expenses—both the said share and the amount of expenses to be determined by the company’s books—shall be paid annually, if need be, by the company to the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt for the service of the bonds. The Imperial Ottoman Government shall refund to the company any sums that the latter may have supplied under this headfoi; the serviceii —a— 46 of the bonds issued. The Imperial Ottoman Government further assign, irrevocably and inalienably, to the holders of the aforementioned Government bonds their share of the gross receipts of the said line. If the gross kilometric receipts of the line exceed 4,500 fr. but do not excet 10,000 fr., the surplus above 4,500 fr. shall belong entirely to the Government. If the gross kilometric receipts exceed 10,000 fr., the portion up to 10,000 fr. being always divided as stated above, 60 per cent, of the surplus over and above the 10,000 fr. shall pass to the Imperial Government, and 40 per cent, to the Company. It is^ agreed that ii the gross kilometric receipts do not reach 4,500 fr. the sum required to make good the deficiency in this amount shall be paid to the concessionnaires by the Government at the same time as the annuity of 11,000 fr. from the special assignments to be agreed on between the Imperial Government and the concessionnaires before the fulfilment by the con cession nai res of the clauses of the present convention relative to each section. The above assignments shall be collected and paid through the agency of the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt. As regards the Government bonds to be issued for the construction of the different sections of the railway, the receipts accruing to the Imperial Government shall be pooled in such a manner that the amount available shall be assigned to the whole of the said bonds in proportion to the original nominal value of each issue. Immediately after the payment of the coupons and the sinking fund of the Government bonds issued, the surplus of the receipts accruing to the Imperial Ottoman Government shall be paid to the latter annually after the completion of the formalities provided for by article 40 of the present convention. Article 3G. lor the purpose of determining the average of the kilometric receipts of the new Bagdad lines, all the receipts from every portion of the new lines, together with the net receipts referred to in articles 23 and 33 of the present convention, shall be pooled as and when the new lines are opened to traffic. 1 he average of the gross kilometric receipts thus obtained shall serve as the basis for ascertaining the total of the sums to he paid in accordance with article 35 .

The longitudinal profile shall be drawn to a scale of 5 - ( f()(j horizontal and -^jq vertical, the levels of which shall be referred to the mean sea level as a datum-line ; below the profile there shall be indicated, by means of three horizontal lines drawn for this purpose :— (a.) Distances of 1,000 metres each along the railway from its starting point; (b.) The length and the rate of the gradients; (c.) The length of the tangents and the graduation of the curves of the line, showing the radius of each of these latter. The concessionnaires shall further submit a general plan to a scale of yo'ool)o&gt; and a longitudinal profile drawn to a horizontal scale of xotrdoo an( l &amp; vertical scale of ycToo' Art. 3. The works shall be carried out for a single line. Art. 4. The width of the gauge inside to inside of the rails shall be from IASS metres to 1*455 metres. The sidewidths, i.e., the portions of the permanent way comprised on either side between the outer edge of the rail and the edge of the ballast at the top, shall be not less than 1 metre for a single line ; if there is a double line the intervening space shall be 2 metres wide. Art. 5 . The concessionnaires shall construct along the railway such ditches, gutters, and small banks as shall be deemed necessary for the drainage of the track and borrow- pits, and the maintenance of the works. The ballast shall have a thickness of 0*40 metre, and the sleepers shall be of metal. The formation width beneath the ballast shall be 5*50 metres. This width may be reduced to 5*10 metres in the difficult portions of the line. It may even be reduced to 4*50 metres when the ballast walls rest on masonry or solid rock. Art. G. The tangents shall be connected by curves, the radius of which may not be less than 500 metres. A tangent of 100 metres must be inserted between two reverse curves. The curves must further be joined to the tangents by means of a parabolic curve, which must encroach on the straight portion for half its length. The length of tangent remaining between the commencement of the parabolic curves may then be reduced to 10 metres on condition that the radius of curvature is increased as much as possible. Art. 7. The normal maximum rate of the rise and fall of the gradients is fixed at 18 millim. per metre. The junctions of the gradients shall be effected by means of vertical curves of a radius of 1,000 metres. The gradients corresponding to curves of small radius must be reduced as much as possible. The concessionnaires shall have the right to propose such modifications as may appear to them useful to the provisions of this article and those of the article preceding it, i.e., a reduction of the radii of curvature to 300 metres, and an increase in the gradient to 25*8 per mil in those parts which present special difficulties. But such modifications can only take effect after they have been approved by the Imperial Government, and in so far as they do not prevent, in case of need, an average speed of 75 kilom. an hour, including stops, over the whole line. Art. 8 . There must be a sufficient number of passing-places and sidings for standing, loading, and unloading, and they shall be determined by the Government on the proposal of the concessionnaires. It is hereby provided that the average distance between the stations shall be about 20 kilom. The length of the passing-places shall not be less than 300 metres measured between the fouling-points. In grading the longitudinal profile care shall be taken to provide level stretches of sufficient length in places where new stations are likely to be subsequently built. Art. 9 . When the railway has to cross roads or tracks, the preservation of which is necessary for the communications of the country, subways, bridges, or level crossings shall be constructed according to the configuration of the ground. When the railway lias to be carried over a road, the span of the viaduct shall be fixed by the Government, with due regard to local circumstances, on the proposal of the concessionnaires, and may vary from 3 to 10 metres. In the arched viaducts the headway below the keystone of the arch from the road54 level shall be at least 5 metres; in those that are constructed with horizontal girders or beams the headway to the girder or beam shall be at least 4*30 metres. The width between the parapets of the viaducts shall he at least 4'50 metres for a single line and 8 metres for a double line. 4 When the railway has to pass under a road, the width between the parapets of the bridge which supports the road shall be fixed by the Government, with due regard to local cn cumstances, and shall vary from 3 to 10 metres, accordnm to the importance of the road. ’ The span of the bridge between the abutments shall be at least 4'50 metres for a single line, and at least 8 metres for a double line j the headway allowed between the outer rails and the keystone of the arch for the passage of trains shall be not less than 4'80 metres. ■, , case of roads being crossed on the level by the railway the rails must be laid without any projection or depression above or below the surface of these roads, so as not to interfere in any way with the passage of vehicles. • Level crossings shall be provided with barriers only at those points where the necessity of protection as shown by the amount of traffic on the road is recognised by the Government. ° ,7 Should jt become necessary during the construction of the railway to divert or alter the position or the profiles of already existing roads, the gradients on the modified parts must not in any case exceed the maximum grade on the old roads. Ihe level crossings must, in the direction of the drainage, be joined to the roads by slopes the gradient of which must not exceed 0'2 per metre on a length of at least 10 metres. Art. 10 . The concessionnaires shall be bound, at their own expense, to restore and secure the drainage of all waters of which the courses have been blocked, obstructed, or modified^ by the works. The width of the waterways in accordance with standard practice in the case of the bridges that are to be constructed where the railway crosses A rivers, canals, and watercourses of any description shall be fixed by the Ministry of Public Works on the proposal of the concessionnaires. Art. 11 . The concessionnaires shall employ in the execution of the work only materials of good quality acquired in the surrounding country, and shall follow standard practice m every respect, so as to ensure that both work and material are of perfectly f solid construction. 1 J Ihe bridges and culverts to be constructed over the watercourses or over the public and private roads, as well as the aqueducts, shall be built of stone and iron or steel; wood shall be used only in the foundations, the floors, and for the stringers to be placed under the rails. Metal bridges with a width of 10 metres and above shall, before they are passed, be tested in accordance with the programme which shall be submitted for the approval of the Ministry of Public Works at the same time as the t designs of these works. Metal bridges shall be calculated in accordance with the last circular of the Ministry of Public Works, either of Prussia or France. . Whatever the gradients the length of the steel rails shall be 12 metres and their weight shall be 37'240 kilog. per metre. The rails shall be laid on fifteen steel sleepers of 58'300 kilog. r The rails shall be laid on plates on each sleeper. The rads, sleepers, &amp;c., shall be of the type adopted by the Prussian State railways. With regard to the arrangement and construction of the buildings, stations and s elters, it is agreed that these shall not be more than are strictly necessary having regard 10 the convenience and ordinary customs of the country. ihe stations shall he built of stone or brick; they may have flat roofs, and stone brick, or concrete flooring. ’ . r slopes of the embankments, cuttings, and borrow-pits shall have a varying inclination determined by the nature of the ground. Such inclinations shall, at the instance of the concessionnaires, be determined during the progress of the work by the Ministry of Public Works or its delegates. Ait. 12 . The concessionnaires shall attach to the general plan which is to be submitted a sketch indicating the nomenclature in detail, and the principal arrano-ements &lt;v passing-places and standing sidings, the level crossings, the bridges and aqueducts construct CtS ab ° Ve and below the railway, and all the works which they propose to The plans of the stations and the engineering works shall be drawn to a scale of ukr-. rt, 13. In passing through towns and villages, and at the stations, the line shall,[426] E 4 w K 55 if it is thought necessary, be separated by fencing from the contiguous properties and buildings. Art. 14. The plans that are to be submitted for the expropriation of the lands hall be drawn to a scale of -^xuny Art. 15. As the work on the various sections proceeds, the concessionnaires shall have made at their own expense a joint delimitation and a cadastral survey of all the parts of the railway and everything appertaining thereto. They shall at the same time cause to be drawn up, at their own expense and^ in conjunction with representatives of the Government, a descriptive statement showing the bridges, aqueducts, and other engineering works that have been carried out; a certified copy, of the report of the delimitation, the cadastral survey, and the descriptive statement shall be deposited in the archives of the Ministry of Public Works. All the land expropriated after this general delimitation for supplementary work must be formally delimited as the expropriation proceeds, and this will be mentioned in the descriptive statement referred to above. Likewise all engineering works constructed after the submission of the descriptive statement to the Ministry of Public Works shall be noted thereon on their completion. Chapter II. —Maintenance and Working. Art. 16. The concessionnaires shall always maintain in good order the line and everything appertaining thereto, and the equipment and rolling stock, so that the movement of traffic throughout the whole is always easy and safe ; they will take constant care to avert any cause that might give rise to accidents. Should the concessionnaires give proof of negligence or cause delays in carrying out the present engagement, they shall receive a summons, and if within a period of one month from the date of the summons they have not complied therewith^ the Imperial Government shall themselves take the necessary steps, at the cost of the concessionnaires, and shall proceed to carry out the necessary repairs; the cost of this work shall be charged on the working expenses and on certain receipts accruing to the concessionnaires, and in case these are insufficient, the concessionnaires shall be bound to make good the deficiency. Art. 17. The concessionnaires shall draw up every month and submit to the Ministry of Public Works a statement showing the receipts of every kind from the railway and everything appertaining thereto. The statement showing the gross receipts shall indicate the gross receipts derived from the conveyance of passengers and goods as well as all other proceeds and receipts from the actual railway. The rates levied on military transports, which may be effected on credit, shall be embodied in a separate monthly account. The amount of them shall be carried to the gross receipts when collected. Chapter III.— Repurchase and Forfeiture of the Concession, and Formalities to he fulfilled on the Expiration of the Concession. Art. IS. In the event of the concession being declared to have been forfeited, under the terms of article 29 of the convention, provision shall be made for the fulfilment of the engagements entered into by the concessionnaires by means of tenders after a valuation of the works already constructed, the plant, fixtures, and rolling stock belonging to them, and in fine of all the materials and land purchased by them; the highest tenderer shall thereupon undertake the fulfilment of all the engagements incumbent on the dispossessed concessionnaires. The dispossessed concessionnaires shall receive from the new concessionnaires the value fixed by the assessment of the aforesaid plant, after, howe\ T er, deduction of the costs. Any surplus shall be paid over, for the account of the Imperial Government, to the Administration of the Public Debt, to be appropriated for the sinking fund and interest on the Government bonds issued for the forfeited section. If the above- mentioned tender lead to no result, tenders shall again be invited after a lapse of six months, and with a suitable reduction in the price; and if this second attempt equally leads to no result, the concessionnaires shall definitely forfeit their rights under the present convention, and the objects put up to auction shall become, without any payment, the property of the State. Any security deposited and not yet restored shall revert to the Government. Art. 19. In the event of the withdrawal of the concession for the railway by the Imperial Government under article 19 of the convention, the equipment and rolling stock, such as locomotives, carriages, and waggons, used in the working of the line shall be5G surrendered free of charge to the Imperial Government. All stores and fuel and all furniture used in the working of the line and existing at the time of the withdrawal of the concession shall be purchased, on expert valuation, by the Imperial Government. Ait. 20 . On the expiration ot the period of the concession for each section th (4 concessionnaires shall deliver, free of charge, and in good condition and free of all debt and liability to the Imperial Government, the stations and sidings for loading and unloading, as well as the buildings used in the working of the line, such as sheds and houses for the officials engaged in controlling, inspecting, and collecting, the fixed machinery, and in general all stationary stock not used in transport. The equipment and rolling stock, such as engines, carriages, and waggons, used for the working of the line, shall be surrendered free of charge to the Imperial Government. The materials used in construction and for repairs, fuel, stores, and all the movable appliances used in the working of the line and in existence at the moment of the termination of the concession shall be purchased, on expert valuation, by the Imperial Government. Notwithstanding, the Imperial Government shall be bound to take only such stores as are required for the working of the line during six months. In the event of the Imperial Government ascertaining five years before the expira tion of the concession that the railway is not being maintained in good repair, a summons shall be issued to the concessionnaires, and a certain time shall be allowed to them to put the line in good repair. If this summons leads to no result, the Government shall undertake the working of the line and everything appertaining thereto and shall them selves carry out, at the expense of the concessionnaires, the repairs necessary to put the line in a good condition, t he costs of repair shall be charged on the working expenses ^ nd J :e . rtain rece ipt s accruing to the concessionnaires; should the receipts prove insufficient, the concessionnaires shall be bound to make good the deficiency. Chapter IV.—Rates and Conditions relative to the Transport of Passengers and Goods. Art. 2 T The transport rates which the concessionnaires are authorised to levy in virtue of article 16 of the convention are fixed by the scale of maximum rates mentioned below, which shall m no case be exceeded without the authorisation of the Imperial Government. These rates, once reduced, may be raised within the limits of the maximum only after a previous notice of one month. Likewise in the event of a reduction of the rates three days notice shall be given. All the rates are charged per kilometre of the distance travelled.
