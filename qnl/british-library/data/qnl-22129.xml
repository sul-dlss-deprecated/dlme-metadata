It is important, also, to take advantage of this opportunity to secure this supply before The Bahrein Petroleum Company may decide to install their own means of making electricity. I would therefore venture to suggest that after y°^ r consideration of The State Engineer’s Note, it may he most ^lly discussed with him from every point of view that seems cogent. In the Adviser’s absence I am most reluctant to be a party any abnormal expenditure; and I would not care to see the Bahrain Government committed to capital expenditure without both your and Mr Belgrave’s complete approval. I am sending a copy of this Note to Mr Belgrave by this week’s airmail asking for his ^ompieiits, and also suggesting the advantage of any technical advice which he may think prudent to obtain. In the meanwhile we await the reply of The Bahrain Petroleum Company to the tentative, prQ££L&amp;&amp;i., which, I understand, has been submitted by airmail ifo'* leir ead Office in San Francisco.

It is understood that you will undertake to ac cept the energy directly it is available.

BAHHjilK 29th ^116,1934 TetE R/ATial7l353 To, H.B.M's Political BAHRAIN Sir Subj ect - Proposed Supply to Bahrain Petroleum Coy . As requested I have the honour to submit a Yearly Financial Forecast on (1) the supply to Manamah and Maharaq and (2) the proposed supply to the B*P.Coy’s canp. In the forecast the expenditure and expected revenue have been confined solely to the cost of production and returns from the supply and sale of electrical energy omitting such items as telephones, wiring etc, which in the near future it is estimated should just pay costs. The slow but steady growth in Manamah and Maharaq is based on the present policy and system of charging which, I believe, could be profitably amended, at a propitious time, to considerably - accelerate the expansion in the town supply. The B.P # Co f s consumption is purely imaginary as no definite data is available. Examples of obtainable results have been worked out on the minimum consumption and on load factors of 20 and 30 per cent which are, in my opinion, on the conservative side, but, should the B.P.Co get busy it is quite possible that load factors up to 60 per cent may be recorded with corresponoing improved results. The revenue derived from the B.P. Co shewn in the schedule has been calculated on the rate offered, viz 3 annas for the first 10,000 units per month and one anna per unit for all over plus Rs*6/ per K.W. of demand per month in excess of 40 K.W. On more closely analysing the cost of production and the advantages accru ing from such a load as that of the B.P.C I am of the opinion the rate offered will probably prove too high to secure the business, and suggest that the B.P.C. be offered immediately, a rate of.75MO.

You will observe that the forecast shews lower working costs for the town than that obtained in the year 1352 principally due to the saving on if’uel Oil. If the financial figures for the year, 1352 can be relied upon then it is estimated that between 1,200 to 1,500 rupees worth of oil were lost possible in the ocean due to a leaky pipe line. Interest and depreciation charges have been calculated on an av erage of 6.7 per cent and a heavy item for insurance included, as well as overhead charges. it has already been suggested to the Adviser that insurance could be more profitably carried out by the Bahrain Government itself by placing the amount of the insurance premium to the sinking fund or to a special account. Two columns have been added. Column Nos6 shews the gross saving with the B.P.C. load and column Not? the B.P.C.load factor. K In the current year, 1353, it is rec^ond, that if an agreement be immediately arrived at, a transmission line could be erected and put into operation in November,1931, and that for the first three months the B.P.C. should only be called upon to guarantee a minimum of 5,000 units per month, after the supply is availabe, to enable them to make the necessary transfer of load and thereafter 10,000 units per month.

No opportunity then or since has been afforded or suggested to discuss the matter. I have one comment to make on the reason advanced by the B.P.C. for not taking a supply from the Bahrain Government is that it does not ring true, because up to now the B.P.C. have in no way conmiitted themselves to a time period and the probable quantity of their consumption^espeuially on thie power side, so how could the relative physical costs ue compared. and ad justment , is not very iar off the mark tor such i-udej-ini te conditions, nor, the gulf so wide that the ditiexeuces could not be bridged provided all c#ats are taken inxo couaxuer^j.en aau proviuea xnoro existed a genuine desire on bulh siues^ftivive at a mutually satisfactory agreement.

The State Engineer, Government of Bahrain Electric Supply Departjient, BAHRAIN Dear Sir, Confirming Mr.Skinner's conversation with v 9 U of last evening. I have to advise you our San Francisco Office has informed us that, because we can generate electric power at much lesser figure than that which vou quoted in your letter of May 1st, it has been decided to construct a plant here of our own and gen erate power sufficient for our needs. We appreciate the trouble you have gone in developing your proposition and regret the difference in price is so great that we cannot avail ourselves of your offer. lours very truly, THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM CO LTD By F .A.Davies. Manager.&lt;9 P.A. It is very difficult to get an idea of the position from the figures of the estimate as thtxxixxfeMLE* these are based not on figures for a separate scheme but on figures for the new scheme combined with present running costs and income. It appears that the State is losing over 266 A ' %/ - T ' every year at present. It is possible that with an improvement in the economic situation this loss my be decreased but the State engineer is of the opinion that before this loss can be turned into a gain the State will have to pay out fresh capital for the plant. He tells me that if the power is supplied to the Oil Company the scheme would pay for itself in two or three years. Stage two would then necessitate a large expenditure of capital which would be fully paid off within five or six years and also would lessen the annual depreciation debit* In any case the Bahrein Government would gain from the very beginning of the scheme as its present annual loss would be veiy considerably lessened. If a scheme of this sort is to c^me into being it might be well to have some binding clause on the company to ensure at least that the money spent by the Government wnuld not be lost in the event of the Company closing down,* I dn. not-know how far the company would be prepared to go to meet the Government But from a private source--Bash--I gather that the Local Agent is not enamoured of the prospect of the scheme having to go through our hands. He said that he feared interminable delays. As far as I can gather the Cpmpany would gain by bringing the electric supply from here. They would not have to pay for or their own plant/ for men to work it and the crude oil or other oil which they would use could be sold in the market instead. However, reliable information about this can only be obtained from the Company and I have not broadhed the subject to any of their membersI suggested to the State Engineer that it would be perhaps clearer if the expenditure and expected income from the scheme were made into a separate statement and if beside it figures under the present system were to be given. He said that he would prepare a statement in this f«rm if asked to do so- A.P.A.S. No: 1. S.No:2. S.NosS. Letter No:1020 of 20/6/1934 to Mr. de dpenier.

Dear Sir : 4 ILiLAI API 5LCCTRIC PO./LR PL,Y:T I have to report as follows on a state of emergency which has arisen in connection with the Manamah Electric Power Plant, and would ask if the Company will be good enough to assist us in making certain changes in +he arrangement of the generating units as suggested below. The generating units, driven by three sets of slow-speed diesel engines, are working continuously to cope with loads which are abnormally high during the present period of hot weather. An additional generating set v/as expected to have arrived in time to meet the heavy load this summer, but we now understand that this will not be delivered until early in 1945. Owing to defects in the cooling system we are unable to develop more than sixty to seventy per cent of the full power of our engines. For many years the cooling has been effected by circulating well water in a closed system with high evaporation losses. As a result scale has accumulated in the water spaces faster than it can be removed, especially during periods such as the present summer when the engines are being run without adequate rests for maintenance operations. Thus, working temperatures have steadily risen and scale formation has consequently become more rapid, until now our power units are threatened with breakdown. Discussing this matter with Mr.Growther-Smith we decided that an immediate change-over to cooling with distilled water, with an adequate outdoor cooler, would involve too great an expenditure of time and materials for an emergency measure. Je therefore propose for the present to apply acid treatment to the ciruclating system of the engines with a view to reducing the accumulated scale, and then to circulate cool well water in an open circuit drained away to sea. This arrangement will involve bye-passing our water tanks and cooling units by means of the addition of certain valves, branch-pieces and lengths of pipe. It is in the preparation of these and their connecting up at convenient times that we would like your immediate assistance.! Will you therefore be good enough to send at once an engi neer to confer with me at our Power-House and take particulars of the work to be done. If the through-passage of well water is to continue for any length of time it will be necessary to consider the yield of the Power-House Well. It is estimated that 5000 gallons of v/ater per hour will be required during the hottest weather. I believe the Company has recent records? of the condition and yield of this well. Would you therefore let me know if it is considered desirable to clean or deepen the bore.The use of Manamah well water for engine cooling is only to be regarded as an emergency measure. I agree with Mr.Growther-Smith that we should consider the use of distilled water in a closed circulating system, cooled in suitable tube coolers outside the Power-House. Such a system would require a larger circulating pump than we have in use at present and the construction of a small distilling plant for making up losses. Also for the cooler a large quan tity of piping (perhaps 500 feet of 3' diameter) and bends would be required. ..ill you please let me know if the Company could supply these materials and assist in nakigg the various components. I would be glad if you could supply us immediately with six Carboys of Hydrochloric Acid treated with an inhibitor rendering it suitable for use in the engines and pipes. Yours very truly, Sd/-G-.S.

The writer has had the opportunity of^talking to Mr. Steele the Bahrain State Engineer while he was in Cairo, on the subject of the supuly of electric power to the Corporation’s Resthouse. It Is the intention of the Corporation to install an air conditioning system for the two buildings in the Resthouse compound. 2 . V/hile these sets are working, they will require a conti nuous supply of 55 K.v/, Mr. Steele tells me that this extra demand is in exdess of tho capacity of the Manama Power Station • when other projected lords which have already been booked are taken into account. In making this statement Mr. Steele was including in the capacity of the Power Station the 20C M.w. set already o’! dei.— ed from Messrs. Mirrless Bickerton &amp; Bay of Stock Port. He suggested that I should tfrite to you and say that he would ^ recommend the Bahrain Government to make immediate application for a second similar 200 K.W. set from the same manufacturers, and that if they agreed he would follow up the matte while he is in England on leave. 4 . Ye should be obliged if you could put this matter to the Bahrain Government in order that a decision may be taken as early as possible. If they do not agree to the provision of a second set and if the projected additional loads which have been booked actually develop in fact so that the Manama Power^ Station cannot supply our Resthorre with the power required, it will be necessary for us to install our own and independent generating set. We would therefore be grateful if the views of the Bahrain Government can be communicated to us with^the least possible delay, in order that we may know whether it is necessary for us to order our own venerating set or not. 5. &gt;Mr. Steele expressed himself as confident that there is plenty of future load which can be foreseen to justify the ordering of a second 200 M.W. unit.

Although it was suggested that during these periods you should supply Muharraq Town by feeding back on the High Tension line, I do^not now thinks that this will be necessary, as the supply to our public consumers in Muharraq is always very small I suggest, therefore, that ; r ou supply only the R.A.F. and A.T.C installations, isolating yourself for that purpose by opening the H.T. switch in the R.A.F. Transformer House. With regard to metering the supply to A.T.C, we can pro vide if necessary a meter for insetting in the 3-phase circuit to take up to 40 amps. If the above arrangement meets v/ith your approval, will you please let me know whether you would be willing to operate the H.T. switch yourself.

As you may know, our generating plant consists of two units of 100 K.W. capacity each and one of 200 K.W. capacity, all operated b r Diesel engines of the slow-running type. The fourth unit which it is expected will be installed early next year is to be of 200 K.W. capacity, operated by a new type of mediun-spped Diesel engine. These four units to gether should just about cope with the loads to which we are alread ' committed (both for the public and the Services, the latter subject to possible reduction after the war). additions of small individual generating sets becomes trouble some and uneconomical. It is my opinion that the operation of four individual sets, such as we shall have, is not good prac tice and can only be justified on the grounds of wartime emer- gency. In five to seven years time we should scrap the whole of our power generating plant (it will even then still have a certain market value), and substitute a new plant consisting of three high-speed engine driven units of,say, 300 K.W. capacity each. I should say offhand that our capital reserve, and the prospects of the Public Services in 1950 would abundantly justi fy such a policy, but of course the Government would do well to confirm this with their financial advisers and with a compe tent engineering consultant. additions to our installation, particularly expensive items should, during the'next few years, be steadly resis ted. I $ould advise B.C.A.C. to install a power generating pl r nt consisting of two Diesel-driven sets of the high-speed, semi-*P. stable type, which could be reckoned to give at least five years continuous service. The transfer or sale of such sets after that time would be a satisfactory proposition. I would be glad if you will keep this letter on file for the Adviser to see on his return.

Dear Sir: MaNAIIAH blectric pov/er plant I have to report as follows on a state of emergency which has arisen in connection with the Manamah Electric Pov/er Plant, and would ask if the Company will be good enough to assist us in making certain changes in the arrangement of the generating units as suggested below:- The generating units, driven by three sets of slow- speed diesel engines, are working continuously to cope with loads which are abnormally high during the present period of hot weather. An additional generating set was expected to have arrived in time to meet the heavy load this summer, but we now unuerfctand that this will not be delivered until early in 1945. Owing to defects in the cooling system we are unaJLLe to develop more than sixty to seventy per cent of the full power of our engines. For many years the cooling has been effected by cir culating well water in a closed system with high evaporation losses. As a result scale has accumulated in the water spaces faster than it can be removed, especially during periods such as the present summer when the engines are being run without adequate rests for maintenance operations. Thus, working temperatures have steadily risen and scale formation has consequently become more rapid, until nov/ our power units are threatened with breakdown. Discussing this matter with Mr. Growthsr-Smith we decided that an immediate change-over to cooling with distilled water, with an adequate outdoor cooler, would involve too great an expenditure of time and materials for an emergency measure. We therefore propose for the present to apply acid treatment to the circulating system of the engines with a view to reducing the accumulated scale, and then to circulate cool well water in an open circuit drained away to sea. This arranement will involve bye-passing our water tanks and cooling units by means of the addition of certain valves, branch-pieces and lengths of pipe. It is in the preparation of these and their connecting up at convenient times that we would like your immediate assistance. Will you therefore be good enough to send at once an engineer to confer with me at our Power House and take parti culars of the work to oe done. If the through-passage of well water is to continue for any length of time it will be necessary to consider the yield of the lower House Well. It is estimated that 5000 gallons of water per hour will be required during the hottest weather. I believe the Company bus recent records of the condition and yield of this well. 7/ould you therefore let me know if it is considered desirable to clean or deepen -the bore.The use of Manaraah well water for engine cooling is only to be regarded as an emergency measure, I agree with Mr. Crowther-Smith that we should consider the use of distilled water in a closed circulating system, cooled in suitable tube coolers outside the power House. Such a system would require a larger circulating pump than we have in use at present and the construction of a small distilling plant for making up losses. Also for the cooler a large quantity of piping (perhaps 500 feet of 3^ diameter) and bends would be required. Will you please let us Know il the Company could supply these materials and assist in making the various components. \ I would be glad if you oould supply us immediately with six Craboys of Hydrochloric Acid treated with an inhibit© rendering it suitable for use in the engines and pipes. Yours very truly, Government of Bahrain.

The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, In 1939 an arrangement was made between the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company for the provision of electric power in the Indian Camp on the Awali-Refinery road south of east Rafaa. It was then thought that this place was likely to develop into a township, but this has not happened. The Banrain Government purchased oloctric power from Bahrain Petroleum Company and retailed it to consumers at uafoa, Bahrain Petroleum Company charged annas 4 par unit and the Bahrain Government charged annas 6 per unit to consumers. The Bahrain Government bore the cost of services, meter reading, inspections etc. 2. Oaxy six premises were connected, one of those is no longer connected and one consists of an Indian • Club which pays only annas 4 per unit. 3. During the last year (1946) the charge for electricity provided by Bahrain Petraleu. i Company was ks.923/4/- rexjresenting the cost of 3693 units. The readings takon on the premises of consumers at Rafaa showed a difference of 3689 units between the main meter and the consumers metars, representing mn 922/4/-. Bahrain Petroleum Company bills'the Bahrain Government quarterly according to th6 English months. 4. On the account for 1365 the total number of un.ita sold to consumers at Rafaa was 1425, at Ks. 401/12/-, the amount paid to Bahrain petroleum Company was ij. 922/4/- and the loss to the Bahrain Government from sale of electricity alone, apart from costs of trans port, inspections, testings etc., was 520/8/-.‘ 5. In view of those facts and as it appears unlikely that Rafaa Gamp will at the present time develop to any extent, the Bahrain Government would like to dis continue the arrangement for purchasing electric power from Bahrain Petroleum Company and retailing it to the four Indians and the Indian Club at Rafaa and I should therefore bo obliged if you would inform me whether you are agreable to the cancellation of the existing arrangement as from 1st Rajab 1366 (20th May 1947) and for future electricity supplies to be billed to the consumers concerned by the Company direct.
