Routing. If ships travel direct from England to Basra (e.g. oil tankers) it would seem best to oensign the oar to me as P.A. Kuwait sending it to Basra; to ask representative Basra (l believe there is one) to take delivery of it; and the H.A.S.C. or other appropriate military formation at Basra to deliver the car in running order to P.A. Kuwait. I make these suggestions in order to try to avoid (a) the great delay involved if the oar is seat via India (b) difficulties with tne Iraq customs authorities, and danger of theft from the oar if it is not officially consigned throughout its passage. If I uyaelf arrive in Kuwait before it I would of course collect it at Basra on being informed of its arrival there.20 th Noveisfcer, Dear 3Bdth f '■&lt;ith reference to tlie matter of the car required tjjr Mr. C.J.

Pelly, Political Agent at Kuwait, is now in tills country on leave, and is anxious to expo art a car from here far his use when he returns to Kuwait. Although he would propose to buy the oar himself f ie points out that he would in fact only use it for his vork while in Kuwait. He is paid a travelling allowance by the Government of India and would finance the car from this source. In view of the greatly inflated price of oars In the Middle Kast and India, it is uneconomic for him to purchase one on his return, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has s ugg ested that he should endeaTDur to obtain one in this country. Mr. Pelly has made various enquiries, and understands that tba majority of suitable oars have been comaandeeared by your Deo&amp;rtiaent. He says that the most suitable t^pes vould be a 27 H.P.Hmaber (Military Model) tourer or saloon, jfrQ H.P. Ford V8, 'Utility', or a Chevrolet.Otfoer types are not so suitable. I should be grateful if you would let me know whether a oar (presumably second-hand) could be made available for Mr. Pelly out of the M.W.T. pool and if so for your advioe regarding the necessary formalities and how the oar would best be shipped out to Kuwait. If the M.W.T.oould undertake t*» business of shipping that of oourse would be most convenient. I should that Mr. Pelly expects to leave for Kuwait in a month or so. fours sincerely. K.
