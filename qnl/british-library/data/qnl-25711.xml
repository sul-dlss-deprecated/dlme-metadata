Clive*s despatch lo&lt;,306 of the 16th June, 1931, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a circular issued by the General Registration Department re garding the ownership of land by foreign subjects© 2# As you are aware, foreign subjects are only allowed to own immoveable property in Iran for their residence or place of business, unless their country has a special treaty position. The object of the enclosed circular would appear to be to make it clear that foreign subjects should not accept mortgages on immoveable property since they will have no right of foreclosure unless the land in question is admitted to be for their residence or place of business. Further, the Registration Department or other authority charged with t he sale of immoveable property may not accept an offer from a foreign subject unless the use of the property as residence or place of business has oeen approved© I have the honour, etc©, (Sgd©) H©M©Enatchbull«Hugessen© The Right Honourable „ „ a r Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., etc., etc©, etc©. The Foreign Office©Enclosure in Tehran desipatoh No »356 of the 17th August. 1935 » Giroular Issued by the Registration Department* The following circular has been issued by the General Registration Department to the Registry Offices in the capital and the provinces n Whereas Article II of the Rationality La?i, approved on the 16th Shahrivar, 1308 (7th September 1929)* which was recently sanctioned by the Mejliss as Article 968 of the Civil Code, prohibits wives of foreign nationals from possession of immoveable property except within the limits stipulated by law, and lays down that if they exceed those limits in appropriation of property they must* within a period of one year, transfer the same to Iranian subjects, failing which the property 7/ill be sold under the supervision of the Public Prosecutor of the Primary Court in accordance with the stipulations of the law of the 16th iChordad 1310 (7th June, 1931), and Whereas in Section 4 of Article 2 (Annex Ro*5) of the Law granting Concession to The Imperial Bank of Persia it is stipulated that in mortgage transactions the Bank can hold ownership of mortgaged properties for no longer than one year, and Whereas accord ing to the notification Ro*1054.8 of the 8th Mordad 1308 (July 30th, 1929) of the Ministry of Justice, applications for registration received from foreign nationals cannot be granted if they are for cases other than those permitted in the Treaties, unless the national concerned gives a written document to the effect that within a period of one year iron the date of his application he will transfer the property to an Iranian subject and Whereas by virtue of Note No.15312 of the 3rd/&lt;3r&amp; k or dad, lol3 (25t;h July, 1934) of the Ministry for i^reign Affairs, no foreign nationals are authorised to acquire or possess immoveahle property more than what they need for their dwelling and business', therefore. In view of the foregoing, mortgage and hypothecation transactions In favour of nationals of friendly countries, setting up in fact a sort of possession and occupation and right will be prohibited, Nevertheless, as legal regulations consider from an economic viewpoint hypothecation and mortgage transactions as commercial and loan transactions, they are therefore not affected by Treaties and Regulations unless the Registration Office concerned would be bound to issue a document of transfer® Thus the right of ownership by foreign nationals would have legal justification when such right has been acquired in accordance with Treaties and Regulations. In view of the above, therefore, whenever foreign nationals wish to avail themselves of the provisions of Article 34 of the Law of Registration in connection with a winning tender for a property then can be issued with a document of ownership only when they are entitled to ownership in accordance with Treaties. In such cases the Registration Offices are enjoined, after conclusion of a tender, to refer to the General Registration Department for permission to issue document of ownership, so that in the event of absence of legal right to the possession of the property issue of document of ownership would be refused®” (Published in the Official Gazette No.1959 of the 6th Murdad, 1314 (31st July, 1935)®s Copy (E 3728/3728/34) 1935 J mr-* ~**r Wi miu\ Extract from Translation of the lavr of registration of lande d •properties and documents relating; to various t ransactions enacted fry the Persian Government dated Hamal 1502 f March 22nd 1923 - April 20th 1925 )/' Clause 54 .
