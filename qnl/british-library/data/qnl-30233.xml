He has got better material to replace them, is only 26 men short of full strength, and can fully train new men as sepoys in three months and about 30 gunners signallers and the like amongst those dismissed in another two months. Latest figure available is Rs. 1,28,000 from Subsidy being spent this year on Levies out of a total expenditure of Rs. 1,98,000 on them, the other Rs. 70,000 being found from State Budget vide my letter C/844 December 30th, 1941. 4* Hirst states terms offered and accepted which were finally by choice of men themselves Rs. 26/- per mensem without rations cf. my telegram No. C/1223 October 2nd are only minimum living wage in view of high prices prevalent here and only \ wholly satisfactory solution would be supply rations to men or sale to them at controlled prices. Both are difficult but we are considering possibilities.
