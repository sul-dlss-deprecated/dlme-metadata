In ray own opinion while it is desirable to cammeramorate the termination of hostilities in the West it is essential that the fact that the war in the Best is by no means finished should be brought home to everyone.

I have not yet discussed this question with His Highness as I consider that if I did so it would certainly raise in his mind what may be false hopes of an early cessation of hosti lities. As far as the Bahrain Government is concerned I think the close of the European war might be celebrated in following manner. A salute of guns. Public decorations, though few people have any material to use for this purpose. Prayers in the Juma Mosques. Feeding of the poor and possibly a feast for the Police. Release of a few prisoners, I have at present certain prisoners whose release I could recommend. A public holiday. I fear that none of these suggestions are ones in which the Bahrain Government and the services could easily co-operate. We are affected here as much by the Ear East War as by the war in Europe and the end of the war in Europe is unlikely to have any immediate effect in Bahrain. Therefore I would not propose that any \ marches or parades should be held as the units which would take part in such celebrations are engaged upon other duties. YG.

It was decided that as far as the civilian element was concerned our festivities would be confined to feeding the poor, firing gunsservices in the churches and mosques. Cinema for the Navy, which will of course depend on the time of the year, but it will be possible, to make use of the cinema for Services if Jufair was not available. As regards the Services it was indicated by the Station Commander that they were proposing to have some sort of entertainment for keeping them within the camps and barracks so that the extra ration of beer would have no unfortunate effect in the Town.

His Highness has now approved the following:- Prayers in the mosques. (The Shia Kadis have replied that they will arrange this and I am hoping that the Sunnis will follow suit). A three days holiday. Decorations. Feeding the poor. Feeding the Police. A remission of one third of the period of imprisonment of all State prisoners. His Highness would also like to entertain a number of British, U.S.A. and Indian troops and Naval Ratings to an Arab dinner. I suggested 100 but on considering the matter I think perhaps 200 could be managed. It would have to be out of doors either inffont of the Palace or in the Fort. 5 Would it be possible for you to /‘ound the military authorities and the Navy as to whether the proposal is pleasing to them? The party would, of course, be 'dry” and perhaps this should be understood beforehand. One would not like the guests to be disappointed. C. J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., I.C.S., H. B.

As a result of fresh communications received from the India Office, it has now become possible, to give a clearer view of the form that the celebrations will take. The proposals for the U.K. are as follows (a.) On the conclusion of the War in Europe (V.E.Day) the Prime Minister wi 11 announce on the wireless that organised resistance has ended. (b) Immediately after the Prime Minister’s broadcast or more probably on the evening of V.E. Day, there will be a broadcast by His Majesty.

Thanksgiving Day will probably be celebrated on the following Sun d ay. ' \ (e) There will be three paid holidays in celebration of the Cease Pipe, the first on the Cease Fire (V.E.) Day, the second on the day following, and the third as an additional Bank holiday probably on a Monday. 3. It has been agreed in the U.K. that in order to prevent an adverse^ effect on troops and war production, public discussion of the arrangemen us for the celebration of V.E. Day should be discouraged, 'and the Press ar^ being advised accordingly. It has also been decided that^no public announce ment in the House of Commons, as had been contemplated, will be made at present. 4. In the light of the U.K. proposals, it has now been decided that ^ the programme of celebrations to be held in India should be as follows ( a ) h.E. the Viceroy will make a brief announcement on the Cease Fire Day (V.E.Day), followed by a formal message to the Princes and people of India at a later date, either on the day of celebrations or on Thanksgiving Day. (b) There will be three public holidays, the first on Cease Day (V.E.Day), the second on the day following, and the third probably on a Monday, which will be set aside for celebrations.

His Majesty^ Government and the Government of India have decided that the following procedure will be observed regarding victory celebrations on the collapse of Germany:- Not before 11 hours British double summer time the Prime Minister will make an announcement of the end of hostilities in Europe on the wireless. On that evening His Majesty the King will broadcast to the nation and Empire. The Viceroy of India will also make an announcement on that evening on the wireless and the two following days will be public holidays.

Political Agent, Bahrain, NSCONFIDENTIAL D.O. Ho* C/536 Dated the 6th May, 1945 My dear Colonel, Cl Will you please refer to Government of India Circular telegram No* 4101 dated 2nd May concerning Victory celebrations which was received here in 8(A) cypher? At the same time the local Sub**postmaster received from the Superintendent of post Offices a telegram of which I enclose a copy. This telegram was received en clair* You will also observe that paragraph 3 of Government of India War Department letter No. F.50/45/W.1, dated the 23rd April, 1945, received under Government of India endorsement Ho. 73-W/45 dated the 28th April, 1945, indicates that V.E. Day arrangements were confidential. I think you will agree that it is absurd to send orders in cypher and under secret endorsements while at the same time broadcasting them to the world in a clear telegram to the post office. 2. incidentally the orders at paragraph 4(b) of the Govern ment of India letter quoted conflict with those in the telegram as the former declared that V.E. Day (l.e. the day of the Prime Minister f s announcement) will be a holiday while the latter .declares that the holidays will commence on the next day. Yours sincerely, The Hon»ble Lieut-Col. A.C.
