(i) As a result of slave trading in his territories, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has lost for the present the good offices of His Majesty’s Government.

Bideford to proceed to Dubai, At the same time I wrote a letter to the Shaikh informing him that he would be responsible for the lives and property of Bri tish subjects and that it was very necessary for him to re assert his authority without delay.

I visited Hawar Island on the 15th April and inspected the new Bahrain Police Post there. The fact that no complaint has been received from the Shaikh of Qatar while this very solid building was under construction is an interesting omis sion, apparently indicating his acceptance of Bahrain* s rights in Hawar. 41.

(ii) On the 8th April 1938, theShaikh of Has al Khaimah wrote to the Hesidency Agent, Sharjah, requesting him to issue ijf a Certificate of Identity for himself and three companions to U enable him to v isit Kttwait, Iraq and Syria. The reason he ,* states for the journey is for a change of climate, but it is more probable that he has some idea of meeting certain persons \ for the discussion of an oil concession. He was informed by the Residency Agent that this could not be done until the good offices of His Majesty*s Government were restored. It is understood that this refusal to grant him/- Intelligence Summary of the © Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period 1st to 15th April 1938.him travel documents may result in his writing a letter of apology to the Senior Naval Officer for his failure to call on Deptford in the autumn of last year, this being the condition precedent to the restoration of good offices* 42* Qatar * On April 14th a rumour was circulating in Bahrain that Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Than! of Qatar had died.

I do not hear aucn a tremendous lot of news about Haaa and 3audi Arabia generally but I will make sure tnat anything interesting wnien cornea along is included in my Bahrain diaries. I am sending a copy of your letter to de tiaury at Kuwait. 2 . The following little item of news may be interesting to you personally. It is not quite the sort of thing that I would like to put in my diary, wnicn goes ■ to far too many people. His Highness tne Lihaikn of Bahrain was tremendously impressed by the treatment wnicn he receivec ■i from Ibn Baud in Jedda and Mecca, and is very anxious to do something which will at the same time serve as a mark of his gratitude and appreciation and will make a splash in the newspapers. The comraent that his own hospitality to the Amir Saud was just as large-hearted fell on deaf ears, j and, as we have all been fearing for a long time, he said ne &lt; wanted to abandon the transit dues on goods for Baud! Arabia.'/ Jit was so insistent that Ibn Baud himself had not mentioned this that it is fairly obvious that someone from Ibn Saud’g entourage had suggested it. It was pointed out to tne Shaikh that tne abandonment or transit dues was a poor way of expressing his gratitude for personal favours, since it did not cost him a half-penny personally, and it amounted in effect to a present from tne people of Bahrain to tne King.

Local Affairs . (i) Three nakhudas of dhows have recently been arrested and heavily fined for attempting to bring indigent foreigners without passports into Bahrain. At the same time an extensive round-up was made in the bazaars of Persians and Qatifis who have been found here without passports and without any osten sible means of livelihood. Some 500 persons were detained for examination and though many of these were subsequently released, the Agency Court is now extremely busy dealing with the balance under King^ Regulation Ho. 2 of 1937. It is hoped that these operations, particularly the heavy fines on the nakhudas, will cause some considerable diminution in the number of indigent foreigners landing without permission in Bahrain. (ii) The annual 'looting' expeditions by notables from the Trucial Coast, who come here with presents of a few camels- 2 - to His Highness the Shaikh with the object of extracting a motor car or at least a thousand rupees each from him, are now in full swing* Even Shaikh Hamad, generous as he is, is getting extremely tired of these people and has besought my assistance in putting them off. He regretfully declined my suggestion that he might manage matters himself by return pre sents of equally worn-out camels to his visitors. (iii) A fire occurred at No. 56 Well in the Bahrain Pet roleum Company* s Oil Field on the 17th April. This is a new M edge well” and a test had just been made which resulted in a good deal of oil lying about the rig. By the most extraordi nary misfortune a spark from an engine just being started fired the oil-soaked clothing of a cooly, and while he himself was being extinguished in the mud-sump the fire spread to the der rick floor. It was however extinguished quite quickly and no serious damage was done. 48. Trucial Coast . (i) Reference paragraph 29(i) of my Summary No. 5 of 1938. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has had the impertinenc e t o en quire why he has been deprived of the good offices of His Majes ty* s Government, and to enquire also what reasons we have for stating that s lave trading goes on through his territories. Since the latter enquiry appeared to indicate the* the intention more of suppressing informers than of slave traders, he has re ceived the reply that since he is the Shaikh he presumably knows all that is going on in his Shaikhdom and that it is his busi ness to put a speedy end to slave traffic. (ii) Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, seems to be doing fairly well for himself. One story, so far unconfirmed, is that he has managed to assert authority over quite a considerable stret ch of Ras al Khaimah territory in the Wadi al Kaur. The small Shaikh or Wall of South (independent) Diba also appears to re cognise Kalba as his suzerain. It is a pity that Shaikh Khalid suffers so much from malarial (iii) Intensive patrolling and dhow searching on the Tru cial and Batineh Coasts by the three sloops now in the Gulf have resulted in a crop of rumours. One of them, which has been re produced in a Baghdad newspaper (and which I hope will appeal to the sloops) is that an entire British fleet is now in the Persian Gulf. Another, which is interesting as indicating the present trend of thought on theCoast, is that the Abu Dhabi and Has al Khaimah pearling fleets are to be seized. 49. Saudi Arabia . (i) Reference paragraph 100 of Jeddah Report for March 1938. The deepening of No. 2 Well at Dhamman proceeds slowly through hard rock formations. Meanwhile the flow from No. 7 c©re tinues undiminished, and everyone is very satisfied. The party of 16 persons to which reference is made in the JeddehReport is actually engaged on geophysical exploration by the seismic method in the Abu Hadriyah direction (nowhere near Wasr as Salwa). The object of the seismic tests is to lo cate likely subsurface structures where there are few surface exposures to assist. I understand that the California Arabian Standard/--3- 7X Standard Oil Company believe that they have located a very hopeful structure, and that test drilling in this area will be undertaken when equipment can b e released from Dhamman.

A strong shamal has been blowing in Bahrain, and the pearling fleet has been unable to go out to the banks. This will probably result in a request for an extension of the fixed diving season at the other end. Meanwhile there is much depression in Bahrain at the news that the pearl market is weaker than ever and that in the pre sent state of world affairs there can be little hope of an imp rovement • 54.

Movements of British Officials . I left on a cruise of the Trucial Coast on the 30th May 1938 in H.M.S. Shoreham. Squadron Leader Coates, Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, was also on board. I visited the Shaikhs of Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm al Qqdwain and Ajman. Ras al Khaimah was omitted owing to his obstinate reluctance to set foot on a rt man-o-war M , and I was unable to go to Kalba, as I had to cut short my programme ani return to Bahrain by air in order to deal with developments in the Bahrain Unallotted Area case. &gt;0. British Interests . (i) Mr. J.S. Skliros, Managing Director of Petroleum Concessions Limited, arrived here on the 5th June in one of the Company* s planes and left on the 9th June 3938. (ii) Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgaave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, left on the 10th June by Imperial Airways for the United Kingdom on leave. 31. Local Affairs . The condition of affairs in the Shia Qadhi Court at Bahrain has given rise to much anxiety in the last year or two. The Court consists of three Qadhis whose personal quarrels are so violent that it is impossible to expect an unanimous or reason able decision in any case of any importance. For a long time now the Bahrain Government have been trying to find a good Shia*h Qadhi to put things right in this Court and also to take on the religious training of Bahrain youths; and at last they have succeeded in obtaining the services of Shaikh Abdul Hussain Al Halli of Najaf who arrived in Bahrain on the 13th June. Since the Qadhis Court has been closed for the summer (i.e. while the Adviser is away) he is to concern himself solely at first with the Religious School. 62, Trucial Coast. (i) Ras al Khaimah i Reference paragraph 41(ii) of my Intelligence Report No. 7 of 1938. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has written an adeauate letter of apology to the Senior Naval Officer for his failure to call ~~ 'V'-S, Deptford last October. Nevertheless he still professes to be afraid of calling on sloops until he receives a written assurance of immunity from arrest. (ii) Abu Dhabi &gt; A Shference paragraph 48(i) of my Intelligence Report No. 8 of 1938. ( _ ,-3- © ihe Shaikh of Abu Dhabi 1 s bearing towards me was un expectedly pleasant and cordial* and he professed to be eager to please His Majesty’s Government, He pretended however that despite vigorous enquiries by him he could not detect any ins- tances of slave trading in his territories* and assured me that if I pointed out to him the culprits he would take ade- 4 quate action against them. He was told that protestations ox loyalty and so forth are better supported by deeds than by words. (iii) Sharjah : (a) On the 16th hay 1938 the Shaikh of Sharjah oaid a visit to the Shaikh of Ajman and. it is said* gave Shaikh Khalifi of Kalba* who was on a visit to Ajman, Rs. 1500/- in order to help to *arrange matters” between him and the Shaikh of the Bani Kitab, (b) On the 17th May 1938* Abdullah bin Paris, the Shaikh of Sharjah*s Secretary* arranged an interview between the Ruler ,! of Sharjah and Saif bin Abdullah* and it is reported that the Ruler gave Saif a sum of Rs. 500/- and promised to supply him with rifles and ammunition ”in order to collect a force and attack Shaikh Humaid of Himriyah and also assassinate Shaikh 1 Abdur Rahman of Hira”, This desire for revenge is actuated, it seems, by the Shaikh of Sharjah's resentment against the joint action taken by Shaikh Abduf Rahman (his father-in-law) and Shaikh Humaid of Himriyah against Awamir raiders, which he him- 4 self had failed to take, thus lowering him in the estimation of f the Trucial Coast. The conspiracy failed due to lack of secrecy. (iv) Dubai : (a) negotiations have been carried out* successfully* with the Shaikh of Dubai for a Civil Air Agreement for a period of five years on expiry of the present temporary Agreement on the 25th July 1938. (b) Recently there was an affray in Dubai over taxis plying for hire between Dubai and Sharjah* in which Shaikh Rashid, the elder son of the Shaikh of Dubai, made a fool of himself. It appears that Shaikh Rashid had a sort of taxi-monopoly in Dubai and that Shaikh Maktum bin Rashid* cousin of the Shaikh of Dubai, recently began running an opposition taxi between Sharjah and Dubai. Shaikh Rashid collected about 30 armed men and on the 26th May attacked Shaikh Maktum 1 s car when it was on its way towards Sharjah. The driver of the c ar and Shaikh Maktum's men were wounded and were put in the stocks by Shaikh Rashid till midnight* when they were released by the Albu Falasah. Shaikh Maktum in his turn threatened to stop all cars belonging to the Shaikh of Dubai and an ugly situation developed. The old Shaikh then intervened and tried to pour oil on the troubled waters but I have not yet h-ard ^ if he has been successful. Local opinion is against Rashid holding mono poly and there is a g eneral d emand to leave the road free to all taxi owners. 63. Saudi Arabia . It is reported that the Bahrain boats and launches which went to A1 Khobar recently for the purpose of taking stores, r sand/--4- 2$y sand etcetera for the use of* the oil company there have been turned back by the Saudi Authorities who say that they do not want foreigners to do that sort of work in their territory* The Saudi Authorities took similar steps two years ago. As there are insufficient Saudi boats for the work in progress the Oil Company is in some difficulty, but it is hoped that an arrangement will be reached shortly. Meanwhile intense activity continues at Dammam and rapid development of the oil field there is to be expected. 64. Qatar . The Shaikh of Qatar has agreed to exempt all Boyal Air Force fuel stocked at Dohah from the payment of Customs dues. 65.

He appears to Toe recovering, but is feelipg the heafc badly. Vearllng season is now in full swing and there are 248 Bahrain pearling boats on the banks this season.72/- - 2 - 70. Trucial Coast , (i) Shaikh Mohammad bin Rahmah of the A1 Bu Shamis, who had come to Bahrain to pay a visit to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, called at the Agency on the 27th June. He claimed that he was the Shaikh not only of the A1 Bu Shamis nomads of Khatan but also of those who live in the villages of* Sunainah, Jubail and Hormuz in Dhahirah. He claimed also that the main part of Jebel Hafit belonged to him and his cousins, but ad mitted that a small portion in the north belonged to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and another small part on the east to Shaikh Ahmad bin Rashid al Saif of the A1 Bu Kharaiban. (ii) Dubai : Reference paragraph 62(iv)(b) of my Intelligence Summary No. 10 of 1938. The Shaikh of Dubai, yielding to the influence of his wife and son, failed to effect a settlement and temperatures began to rise. A further demand for fixed allowances in favour of his cousins was ignored, and the latter then proceeded to formulate a series of demands which included the following 1. A Budget and Civil List; 2. Proper arrangements for Health and Sanitation in the townj 3. A watch and Ward Service; 4. Reorganisation of the Customs Department; 5. Fixed Allowances for members of the Ruling Family; 6. Abolition of monopolies held by the Shaikh, his wife or his son, in respect of landing cargo from ships, ferries, motor services etcetera. These demands were communicated in a letter to the Shaikh and immediately afterwards the Rashid family occupied the Daira towers, (Daira is the part of the town on the left bank of the creek), while the Shaikh in his turn began to c ollect his be douin forces. A truce was however arranged and after much ne gotiation, in which the Residency Agent, Sharjah, played a prominent part, a reconciliation was effected. The Shaikh agreed to abolish monopolies and promised that reforms would be made in the Customs and other services shortly; he also pro mised to consider the question of fixed allowances for his relatives. At one stage it seemed that negotiations would break down, owing to the interference of the Shaikh of Has al Khai- mah, whom I had to send home with a reminder of what had oc curred after his intervention in Kalba affairs. The situation now in Dubai is entirely normal. 71.

(ii) Three Bahrain fruit merchants received consignments of fruit from Muscat by the British India Steam Navigation Company* s S.S. 'Bankura” on the 2nd July 1938 and these were duly cleared through the Customs. One basket of limes, however, remained unclaimed and had no marks on it. It was therefore treated as abandoned cargo, and on examination, about 2 lbs of charas, a Mauser magazine pistol and two clips of cartridges were found. Whether this consignment was actually meant for Bahrain or not remains a mystery, but someone has been unfor tunate to the tune of about Rs. 2500/-. (iii) The California Arabian Standard Oil Company’s motor launch H Calarabia M while on its way from A1 Khobar to Bahrain on the 6th July caught fire, exploded and sank. Owing to lack of communication between the two shores no anxiety was felt until late at night when several launches were sent out to begin a search. I applied to Air Headquarters, ’Iraq, for aircraft to ass it in the search and a flying boat arrived the following day. During the morning of the 7th July the American mechanic who had been in charge of the launch and two of the Arab crew were picked up in an exhausted condition after having been in the water for close on 24 hours with a shamal blowing. Two American passengers named Mr. and Mrs. Herring and two Arabs of the crew were drowned and their bodies were not found until the morning of the 8th JUly. It was evi dent that both Mr. and Mrs. Herring had suffered bad burns when the launch burst into flames. 78. Qatar . There is a certain amount of trouble in the A1 Thani family of Qatar. The Shaikh complains that some of his rela tives have been encouraged by the Shaikh of Bahrain to come across to Bahrain where they are given money for the purpose of spreading hostile propaganda in Qatar. On the other hand these relatives have complained to me that the Snaikh of Qatar refuses to give them any share of the money he receives from Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited and that as their other sources of income have now disappeared they have nothing to live on* The Shaikh of Qatar has ignored a suggestion that it is not only incumbent on him but is also in his own inte rests to make provision for his poorer relatives.—3— 79 .

He is, however, far from strong, and the welcome he received from his loyal subjects, lasting over some days, was a dis tinct strain on his energies. (ii) On September 11th, a murderous attack was made on Mr. V/.B* Steele, the State Engineer, by a madman armed with a knife. Mr. Steele was rescued by police after he had been knocked down with a piece of rock, and as his assailant was about to knife him.

He is at present under observation as to his mental condition. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are importing Hasa oil to Zellaq by barges and piping it thence to their refinery. They have found it necessary to do this, as the comparative failure of their second and third oil horizons* has left them with sales commitments which they could only fulfil by drain ing their main horizon at a rate which would bring in water. 108.

It appears that on the day of the r Id Bin Saud and the Crown Prince stopped at the latter* s house for a glass of sour milk each. Sometime later the Crown Prince was seized with violent stomach pains and sent for the doctors. While they were attending to him urgent messages came from the King for the doctors to go to him at once. Both of them had violent bouts of sickness lasting for some considerable time, but finally got over it. It appears to be thought that as the sour milk was brought out of the Crown Prince* s house there can be no question of poisoning.

This programme includes (i) The preparation of a project to provide a piped suppl-w for Mansmah Town, thus enabling the numberless shallow wells in ~ the Town to be filled in (ii) The construction of a hatchery for larvicidal fish to be used in these shallow well© pending their elimination (iii) Experiments in vertical drainage for stagnant water (iv) Measures for ensuring the proper maintenance of irrigation ditches and 'drains in gardens (with proposed penal provisions) (v) Preparation of large-scale contoured maps for control work (vi) Propaganda schemes. It net remains to ensure that the programme is carried out* 2. An allied problem, which has given much cause for anxiety to the Political Agent and the Adviser lately, is the indiscriminate artesian-well drilling and the appaling water wastage in which everyone joins merrily at present on the theory that •’enshallah” there will always be plenty of water. Attempts are now being made to break down this comfortable but impcovident attitude the danger of which is sufficiently evident from the serious decline of the static head almost everywhere, and a letter has been written by the Political Kesident to His Highness the Shaikh urging him to take effective steps for control.

Shaikh Ali, son of His Highness’ brother Shaikh Abdullah, indulged in a particularly revolting drunken bout a few days ago and has now been banished for an indefinite period to Hawar.

The party was met by the Political Agent, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, Shaikh Abdullah, Shaikh Salman and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and lunched at Shaikh Abdullah's house near the aerodrome. His Highness the Shaikh was indisposed that day. They again passed through Bahrain on the 7th April on their way back to Iraq, their mission having been a great success. Nuri Pasha, who had been glum and pre-occupied on the outward journey, was now smiling and cheerful. He had been greatly surprised to find that Ibn Saud was so well informed about affairs in Europe and had been much impressed by his reading of events. Mutual suspicions had been dissipated and each seemed to have acquired a considerable respect for the other. Items of importance in the negotiations have been reported by telegram. (ii) Shaikh Hafiz Wahba does not share the view expressed by the Amir Saud in Kuwait that Mr. Philby is an advocate of peace. Indeed his comments were rather too forceful to be repeated here, except for the following story Mr. Philby had taken some care to warn everyone in the King's Camp against Squadron Leader Domvile (who was in charge of the Royal Air Force ground party) who he said was a British spy and a Shaitan.

The Shaikh of Sharjah is now anxious again to get rid of Shaikh Mana but is afraid to tell him so to his face; Shaikh Mana would like to leave but is insistent on obtaining a guaranteed allowanace from the Shaikh of Dubai* At the moment he is at Abu Dhabi having been taken there in a Sharjah launch the pilot of which had secret orders to abandon him at Abu Dhabi and to return at once to Sharjah. The following is a typical story of the Trucial Coast. On the 22nd March the Shaikh of Sharjah met the Shaikh of Dubai and said that he proposed to send his Secretary to Dubai for a friendly discussion of future action. That night the Secretary arrived in Dubai with no message of importance but said that he had a tin of nails in a house in Dubai which he would like to take back to Sharjah. Would the Shaikh of Dubai give him a permit to take it without its being subjected to the usual examination ? Shaikh Said gave him the permit but at the same time sent one of his men to stop the Secretary on the outskirts of Daira to ignore the permit and to search the tin. This was done andit was found to contain a few nails on the top and four hundred rounds of ammunition below.

This demonstration coincided with the Political Agent*s final conviction, as the result of certain experiments recently carried out, that the Bahrain Statels scheme for a public water supply in Manama had been framed on meagre and inadequate lines and that the 1 old theory that an effective sewage and drainage system could not be introduced except at prohibitj.ve cost was unsound. Meetings were accordingly held and plans are now to be prepared for a real public water supply and for proper drainage. In order to tie in with such a scheme the six circles in which surface wells are to be filled in have now been reduced to a radius of 200 feet.

Oil An extraordinary report was received on the ^Oth May from the Master of the S.S. 'Barpeta' (un~ fortunately after the ship had sailed from Bahrain) that he had passed a large quantity of oil in the sea about 15 miles North East of Halul Island 0 The existenc of a wide oil patch was confirmed by Royal Air Force aircraft and further enquiries made from the S.S. ’Barpeta' in Basra elicited the information that the oil was welling up as though from a submarine n gusher M forming a mushroom 3’ in diameter and 2 J 6 n ' high. It is unfortunate that the Barpeta did not pick up a few bucketfuls of this oil and bring them to Bahrain for test. Owing to other preoccupations it has not yet been feasible to arrange a fuller investigation on the surface but this will be done as soon as possible. 63. Saudi Arabia The somewhat ill-conceived project for the cons truction of a 25,000 barrel Refinery at Ras Tanura is not quite such a certainty as it seemed to be. At any rate the despatch of construction material from America has been held up pending further consideration. 64* Qatar It is reported that a squabble occurred on the 30th May between minor members of the Qasim and Ahmad sections of the Qatar Shaikhly family. Shaikh Hamad, the heir-apparent, tried to turn this into a major issue and demanded that the Ahmad party should bitherarasi-ic action, though this remains to b e confirmed. . ^ ama d ’s attitude was probably influenced ^^'k 163 following the distribution (or more likely the non-distribution) of the oil money which was paid by the Company on the 17th May. 66* Trucial Coast Reference paragraph 49 of my Intelligence Summary No. 8 of 1940. The Shaikh of Dubai has been pressing his demands on the Shaikh of Sharjah to turn the Auwlad Rashid out of his town and also to force the Shaikh of Hira to turn the Auwlad Bati out of Hira. After a good deal of talk the Auwlad Rashid, with the exception of Shaikh Mana 5 s family, moved to Hira and t his was followed by an agreement between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah to 'boycott” Hira until both the Rashid and Bati families are forced to leave. The Shaikh of Sharjah has always claimed that Hira is under his suzerainty but is far too pusillanimous in character and weak in armed strength to enforce this claim. Although the agreement between the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah has resulted in the road between the two towns being reopened to traffic and in a general easing of tension, it is highly improbable that it will have any effect on the Shaikh of Hira's expressed determination to keep the Rashid and Bati families in his town. 66 .

The news had an electrifying effect on British residents of Manama and employees of the 0ml Company. This development has been reported separately.

Local Affairs Shaikh Said bin Maktum oP Dubai recently pass ed through Bahrain on his way to visit Ibn Saud. Ibn Ssud evidently spoke to him about the distressful quarrel that continues to divide Bahrain and Qatar and, according to a letter from Shaikh Said to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, he invited Shaikh Said to try his hand at a reconciliation between the two States. A less promising arbitrator could scarcely have been chosen. The Bahrain Shaikhs re gard Said as a poor fish and the Shaikh of Qatar has an equally low opinion of him. Said went to Qatar and wrote to the Shaikh of Bahrain that he would address him again after talking over the matter with the Shaikh of Qatar. No letter has arrived and the episode can now be written off. Ibn Saud has for a long time been anxious to see Bahrain and Qatar on better terms but seems to have no constructive ideas about how to fix it. A good many people on both sides will have to pass on to another world before Bahrain and Qatar are really friendly again. Fortunately it is a matter of lit tle practical importance. 106, Public Opinion The pact between the Axis and Japan seems to have impressed local public opinion rather more than it should have done. The local view seems to be that it will keep America quiet and may well inter fere with her material aid to Great Britain. 107.

At about 5.15 two or possibly three machines approached ahrain from a westerly direction and after circling oyer the refinery at a height between two and three housand feet dropped salvos of bombs, a number of which xailed to explode. Some 84 bomos were dropped, all of yhem of small calibre. They fell very wide* of the target and there were no casualties and no damage was done • Bombs were dropped on the Oil Field of the Cali fornia Arabian Standard Oil Company at Stiaran, Saudi Arabia, the same morning, probably by the same enemy aircraft. There were no casualties, but slight damage was done to an oil and a water pipeline. The possibility of an air attack having been considered to be extremely remote, the defence of the Oil Refinery against saboteurs depended largely on the illumination of the perimeter with powerful lights. These could not be stefttched off before the first salvo of bombs had been dropped. The target must have been of the type longed for by pilots of bombing aircraft - perfectly defined, brilliantly illuminated, and without defence. Why the refinery was not hit is beyond com prehension. 118. Local Opinion 119. It was at first thought by the Arab population that the raid in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia was 'staged' by the British with a view to inciting Arab opinion against the Italians, creating complications between the Saudi Government and the Italians and further rousing the Americans, But disillusionment followed when the Italian and German broadcasts made their usual exaggerated claims of damage done in Bahrain. The facts that the attack was made during the month of Ramadhan and that no hits were scored on so obvious a target which was without any form of protec against aircraft} Kava caused ccntefnpt for the Italians to greatly increase.

Local Opinion News of the successes on the Albanian and Egyptian fronts has had a heartening effect ahd the Italians have sunk still further in popular estimation e 136. Trucial C o ast (i) On the 20th November the Shaikh of Dubai issued an order to his people forbidding them from going out at night after 3 O’clock Arabic (about 9 p.m.) It appears that the Shaikh of the Awamir met Shaikh Jumah, the Ruler’s brother, and told him that he had seen some wandering Bedus who said that they had been given rifles by Shaikh Mana’ . Shaikh Jumah at once concluded that an attack from Bahrain, where Shaikh Mana J is at present, was imminent and hence the curfew. (ii) About the 15th November, Shaikh Ahmad of Diba Hisin complained to Shaikh Humaid, the nephew of Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, that the Shahuh of Bai’ah (Diba) were interfering in his internal affairs. Shaikh Humaid sent 50 men to reinforce the guard at Dufe&amp;i Diba and advised Shaikh Ahmad to consult Shaikh Khalid who was then at Ajman. After Shaikh Ahmad had left for Ajman, the Shahuh started felling and destroying trees in the Hisin area; the Hisin garrison fired at them in retaliation and generally tension between the two parties increased and there was sniping day and night and both sides sustained some Casualties. When the trouble first broke out the Shahuh requested the Shaikh of Dubai for some ammunition but he refused to give them any saying that he himself was in need of all his supplies. But he advised Shaikh Humaid and the Shaikh ox the Shahuh to cease hostilities promising to go himsel to Diba to settle their differences. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, had a secret meeting with Shaikh Khalid andit is rumoured gave 2000 rounds of ammunition for use against the Shahuh. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who was also invited to tnis meeting excused himself. Shaikh Khalid left Ajman for Kalba on the 30th November and the latest reports indicate that the trouble at Fiba has beL sealed except that the defences newly erected by Diba all result of the recent disturbances may remain as they are. 137/-137.
