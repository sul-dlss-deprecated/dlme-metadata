T have marked a reference to 'tumbledown slacks and straw hovels”, the sight of which has greeted the eyes of so many travellers ( gentle and simple f for so many years. I re marked on it to you three years ago. While the other schemes for improvement and beautification are under way, surely it would be possible to do something about the approaches to Bahrain by air passengers. Yours sincerely, C.D. Belgrave, Esquire, CBE, Adviser to the Bahrain Government BAHRAIN.D.O. No. iyi r^. Adviserate, August 29&gt; 194S« Reference your D.O. No. 6/L-114 dated 1 6 th August 1948, I have already seen the article v/hich you refer to, and told His Highness about it. His answer was that the most suitable route from the B.O.A.C. landing place to the town is along Shaikh Daij Road, infrcn^of the palace. The whole area in question belongs to Mustapha bin Abdul Latif, of Bombay, who lets out the ground to barasti dwellers many of whom are low class Persian coolies. These figures may interest you, I have them from Manama Mun i c ip a 1 i ty: - Year Saaf houses Stone houses total 1938 1707 1839 4546 1943 2724 2136 4860 1948 2570 2499 5069 This shows that saaf houses are on the decrease and stone houses on the increase, but there are still many people who prefer to live in a saaf house, especially in the summer. It is only the north road from the B.O.A.G. jetty which goes through the saaf area; from Muharraq to the B.O.A.C. Rest House one scarecly passes a single barasti and if B.O.A.O. took their passengers along tlve road infront of the Palace they would only pass one group of barastis. C''- Confidsn^A. C.J.

                           Arab Worldthat referred to 'tumbledown shacks and straw hovels' being visible from the air over Bahrain. Pelly enquires whether anything can be done to improve the image of Bahrain from the air. Belgrave's response (folio 3) contains statistics regarding the increasing number of stone houses constructed in Bahrain from 1938 to 1948 and suggests an alternative route for planes to pass through.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Housing</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000123#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
