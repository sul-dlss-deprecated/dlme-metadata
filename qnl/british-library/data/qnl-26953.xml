Teat .er report *Foreign Office ,S.W.!• 27th May,1937. Dear Clauson, For some years we have been in the habit of sending your department a copy of the diary written each month by His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz. These diaries are, of course, written primarily for the information of the Legation and it is the case that a good deal of the information which they contain, though useful to the Legation, is of small interest to the reader outside Persia, We feel therefore that the proper system is for the Legation to assimilate these diaries and to embody the important points in their own diary of events (which is compiled, by tradition, by the Military Attache). For these reasons we propose to instruct the Consul at Ahwaz that he need not in future send a copy of his diary to us. Before doing so, however, we should be glad to know whether you approve our proposal which will mean that you, also, will cease to receive copies Ahwaz diaries. Yours ever, (Sd.)

On the evening of the 31®t July at about 8.35 P.IU &amp;ome bales of cotton and some timber whioh were lying in the OustOBie compound near the Mesopotamia Iran Corporation’s office and Manager’s residence caught fire. Owing to a strong w 8haraal* (north wind) the fire rapidly spread. Several Customs ware-houses and Mesopotamia Iran Corporation’s House and office caught fire and the British Vice Consulate which is next to the Mesopo tamia Jran Corporation’s building was threatened. Ho one appears to have taJcen steps to extinguish the fire in its first stage, nor do there appear to have been any fire appllancee of any sort vailable. Anglo Iranian Oil Company fire tugs were despatched from Abadan but owing to a severe dust storm tockft hours to negotiate what is normally a half hour’s Journey. On their arrival they and men of the Persian Navy concentrated on preventing the fire spreading from Mesopotamia Iran Corporation buildings to the Consulate. These efforts proved successful and probably saved the whole town of Mohammerah. Police enquiries have been held to try to discover the cause of the fir© but the r©E«l|r is not known. Owing to the nearness of the outbreak to the Mesopotamia Iran corporation and the probability that the fire was caused by a carelessly thrown cigarette, suspicion fell upon the member© of the dinner party which was being held at the time by the Manager of Mesopotamia Iran Corporation and his wife, and these have been subjected to somewhat lengthy examinations. On the other hand it is far more likely that the fire /was0 8 - was the result of the oaraleesne&amp;B of one or other of the Cufctojae guarde who alt about or wander at random all over the Customs premises, smoking and cooking at will. The Cue^oas officials have estimated that the loss due to the fire of 31st duly was 50 million rials (£550,000). This includes Road Tax, Customs duty and Storage charges which would have been leviable on goods burnt and the actual value of tae goods destroyed can be placed at about £#200,000. Loss of the goods belonging to the Government and damage to the Customs Premises is stated to amount to one million rials (£11,000). It is reported that Rials 1,000,000 worth of weaving machinery whicn belonged to Hie Imperial Majesty the Shah, and Rials 600,000 worth of materials belonging to the Persian Navy have been lost. It is said that orders have been issued by His Imperial Majesty the Shah that these amounts have to be paid up by the Ministry of Finance in Tehran without delay. Two Cuetoaa Inspectors arrived at ^ohammerah from Kermaashah on the 3rd# The Public Prosecutor for Khualstan who visited Mohammerah under instructions from Tehran in connection with the Customs fire returned to thwaz on the 16th after handing over the documents relating to the case *o the new Public Prosecutor for Government officlale in the High Criminal Court. kqa Ashraf, the Regional director of Customs at Ahwaz also proceeded to Mohs note r&amp;h on the 1st and returned on the 2nd. % Some of the staff of the Mohaiaaerah Customs have been temporarily transferred to the Ahwaz , us toms /owing9 (£S) owtne to preae of work at Ahwaa aa the cargo arriving at present at Moha«j»arah will he trane-shipped to Ahwaa for clearance. 504 ♦ Censua Department # It has been decided to open an office of the Census Department abortly in Tul Khuarovi.

Commerce .—There was a very great shortage of matches during the period under review and in consequence of several complaints by the public the Government have authorised 9 shops at Ahwaz to sell matches at 10 Dinars a box. A meeting was held by the Governor of Mohammerah on the 22n*d September. All the local merchants attended. The Gov ernor made a long speech on the subject •of large consignments of Persian cotton which are being exported to foreign countries during the current year. He suggested that Persian merchants should form a company so as to import machinery for making their own thread in Persia instead of having to import it. The mer chants agreed to this suggestion and have so far collected some Tomans 30,000 in shares.4 The Japanese show every intention of flooding the market with their piece-goods and cement. The latter is ot an inferior kind and can be sold.considerably cheaper than Portland cement. Its low price (32. sjper ton, c. i. f. Mohammcrah) ot course attracts many) buyers, and its in feriority does not seem to deter the I er- sians from using it for all purposes even as foundation for machinery. No fresh consignment of piece-goods has been imported by the Russians owing to competition by the Japanese. There is no demand even for the piece-goods which they have already stocked at Mokam- merah. 191. National Bank of Persia. —A con signment of 57 cases of new Persian currency notes printed in America arrived at Mohammerah by the German Ship “ Watchfels ” on the 14th September and were sent to Tehran by the National Bank of Persia at Mohammerah on the 15th in charge of a clerk of the Bank and an escort of 20 soldiers. 192.

Ahmed Mirza Zelli, the local Director oi Customs at Mohammerah, proceeded to eh ran on the 22nd on leave. He wa.s replaced by Aqa Rahi, the assistant to M. \ andenryjdt, Inspector of Southern t ustoms. Considerable relief is felt by the local community at getting rid of a bullying and utterly unreasonable official against whom more serious charges have also been made. 195 Police. Knowing 1 that several com plaints against the Nazmieh had been submitted to the Capital by the public and by other local officials, Lieut.-Colonei Qane’, the Chief Commissioner of Police of Khuzistan, applied for sick leave and obtained the necessary certificate from tliG &gt; Health Officer. He handed over his duties V' to Captain Behzadi who came from Mohammerah on the 18th August.

As mentioned above, the inhabi tants of Shushter have been scared since 20th August by the appearance of a monster which carries away children during the night. Several families have left Shushtcr and gone to other places. Troops have been sent but without avail. It is reported that a soldier was attacked by this creature and injured. He fainted immediately through fright and was therefore unable to give any description of the creature. The Acting General Officer Commanding also proceeded h&gt; Shushter on 30th August to investigate but returned without any authentic in formation. It is reported that several children have been carried away but the actual number cannot be ascertained owing to varying reports. No one so appears to have seen the creature which is reported to have disappeared since the middle of September. It is thought to be a leopard or a hyaena, but there are many other fanciful explanations, amongst thep being that it is the last of the Bakht liirllions, a gigantic lizard, or a human being in search of the hearts and entrails of infants for medicinal purposes. ''-The Chief Priest of Dizful, Haji Aqa Sheikh Mohammpd Eeza, who was well known all over Persia died at Burujird on the 27th August.

A. E. WATKINSON, H. B. M.’s Consul for Khuzistan. Lc59oFD—15—9-1-34—GIPSWe have told Watkinson to send copies of the Ahwaz diaries to the Foreign Office direct, but could you manage with four copies of the Ahwaz diary instead of six? Watkinson already turns out eleven copies which means two strikings, since his tynewriter is archaic (incidentally a new one is in process of being obtained). If he has to produce seventeen copies (including six for you) it will entail three strikings which is a very serious additional labour and which, frankly, I don’t think we can ask a busy man to assume. King lilas lacrimae . I should add that the other obvious alternative of cutting down the distribution in Persia and Iraq has been carefully considered but is to our minds most undesirable. He can omit the Isfahan copy but for the rest it is of considerable importance that consuls should know what is happening in neighbouring districts. So I repeat, can you possibly make four copies do? A copy of this letter is being sent to Watkinson at Ahwaz. Yours ever, (od. ) Victor Mallet.

'On the morning of the 6th July the Iraq Police and Security authori ties boarded a Japanese cargo ship anchored opposite Haji Salbuq Island and arrested the Persian Customs peon who was on duty in the said ship and taken away to Iraq alleging that he was the person who had fired the shot and killed the Bellamchi although the Captain and officers of the Japanese ship protested and stated that no shot was fired from the ship. On the 7th July the Persian Police and Sulhiyeh authorities boarded the Japanese ship and recorded a statement of the Captain and officers and telegraphically reported the mater to Tehran. The arrest ed man was in custody of the I raq authori ties until the 21st. The Persian authori ties state that there was no cause for the arrest of the Customs peon as the shot was actually fired from the Iraq side and not by the Persian guard.

He was taken before the Adlieh authorities at Mohammerah on August 3 on a charge of attempted smug gling of currency from the country. The dossier has been transferred to Ahwaz with a recommendation that no fine should be inflicted as no regulations have been communicated to the Adlieh authorities regarding removal of currency notes from Persia, and that the money should be handed to the Iraq authorities, as it was collected for charitable purposes and was not the personal property of the priest.

He asked the Mutas sarif to request his Government to disarm the tribesmen.

The Governor-General in reply told the Mutassarif that the Iraqis could file suits in the Adlieh against their Persian debtors and to this the Mutassarif replied that the articles robbed from the Persian tribes could also be claimed by filing complaints in the Iraq Courts. The Persian attitude appears to be that the fault is all Iraqi s and that the Persians can do no wrong. The conference did not end satisfactorily, and negotiations are to be re-opened in about 3 months’ time. The time chosen was not conducive to thorough investiga tion in fact camping in the desert in the middle of July must have been most un pleasant. 7 J 'Miscellaneous. —K. S.
