To The foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political DepErtmentf ' simla # Sir* 1 Imve for some tiiae past had under considera tion a report on the conditions at Muscat. 1 have recently receiyed a report from the Political Agent stating that fighting had again broken out between the tribes at Uurt the second port ol Oman. The stoiy is an old one and referred to the rival factions of the town. The iiani bu Ali, who belong to the same tribe as the Amir of Jaalan and who command a faction of perhaps some half of the tribal section of the place,are at heart followers of their tribesman the mix of Jaalan, an important chieftain who has his capital some 30 miles inland and who is supposed to be a subject of the Sultan of Muscat. I now attach a copy of a letter Ko»G-61, dated the 10th April 1928, from the Political i^ent in which he states that the Amir of Jaalan has set up a Customs House at Sur and demands the refund of duty charged by the Muscat Customs at that place on a boat of the i &gt;ani bu Ali# This is serious. On my recent tour 1 visited L.ur — though 1 had no intention of doing so till 1 reached Muscat -•» and 1 attemptea to patch up the quarrel amongst the tribes, but 1 found it was impossible without thethe presence of the titular sovereign though a truce had already been xxxaM^jt^L made* While the Sultan can count on the assistance of the Jeneheh section of the tribes at v/ur i doubt if he can do any tiling if the Amir of Jaalan becomes rebellious. The normal course of tribal erents will be for the Amir of Jaalan to become the independent ruler of the Sur district as the Imam of Oman has become the independent ruler of the interior. But Sur is dependent for its existence on Bombay&gt; Zanzibar and Mombasoa# It is a seafaring place and lives on i its dhows* Thus economically it is dependent on the British Government and ^iie Muftcat Government may ask for our assistance indeed they asked me for such assistance in December but 1 awaited the arrival of the ^ultan of iiuscat before dealing with the matter# 1 have however for some time realised that the whole question of Muscat would demand re-consideratiun by next winter but 1 did not anticipate the immediate assumption of power by the Amir of Jaalan who has hitherto expressed friendship for the Buitan* It will now, 1 considert be impossible for the Sultan to visit Europe unless his health really necessitates it in which case he will have to give someone his power of attorney# Without Gur the Sultan^ domains shrink consider- ably though hie revenues are mainly derived from his Muscat whether and .batineh Customs# but I doubt/without our economic pressure he can hold it# If we give this t his vain-glorious attitude must be curbed and we must ariive at facts and not fancies# I will await further report by the Political A^ent# Muscat# and will deal with the matter at length# 1 have the honour to bet a 1 r, Your most obedient servant# y / / iiieut-oolouel, i'olitacalhesiaent 1 ' 1 persian gulf.NFID: -iTTlAL.

We reply to your Icind proposal,that the there are still two &amp;K3C nights and a day unexpired out of the first ns armistice and this is sufficient if they have good intentio to settle the matters. If the Fuwaris and Arama have good intentions,it is very easy to settle the dispute within 5 hours,because our conditions are known to them and they have only to say that they have accepted them unconditionally and then we shall carry them out before tomorrow afterboon. But their intents are not good and they say from their tongues,what is not in their hearts and verily God knows the aggressors. We regret very much to inform you that it is not possible for us yo accept any armistice after the expiry of the present one on you the morning of day after tomorrow. We hope that itaqc will not count this as an aggression from us, as we granted them several armistices and 7 years have passed but they are still am astray and creat disturbance. It may not be hidden to you that we have at present 2000 troops to bring to close this matter before returning to their v homes and families and if we wish to retain them for a time,we require a heavy expence.

I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and for such action as he may deem necessary, the following report on the present situation at Sur. 2. In order to make the position there clear, I have deemed it necessary to include m the report short historical suinmaries of the two tribes involved which I have compiled from the files and records in the Consulate These have been included in the lorm of appendices. Appendix I.—Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. Appendix II.—Historical Summary of the Jenebeh: Appendix III.—Short Summary of recent events. 3. Sur, the second largest town in Oman, owes its importance lar^elv to its being the nearest dhow harbour to India in Arabia. It has been for a con siderable period the chief distributing centre for the slave trade. Dhows nlv regularly from Sur to Bombay and Karachi, Socotra, Aden, Zanzibar and the Atncan coast; also up the Persian Gulf and to the Mekran coast' There is quite a considerable trade with India and a small colony of Indian traders have been resident there for many years. 4. The town is situated on both sides of the entrance of a creek The quarter on the east is called Aiqa and is occupied by the Bani Bu Ali tribe That on the west is called Miqraimatain and is occupied by the Jenebeh Behind the town about two miles from the sea is a ridge ai^d on the plain behind the ridge is Balad As Sur, a stone built village where the Wali resides. Part of it is known as Suq Sur. A large part of the water supply of Sur is obtained from Balad As Sur, and it was m order to keep the town in check by commanding the water supply that this site was determined on for the Wali's residence. 5 In 1901, in order to facilitate the collection of dues at Suv, the Sultan er ^ i. a i lne bIock ' hailses between Sur and Balad As Sur. In connection with the above block-houses 100 extra sepoys were engaged, but this g-arrison does not appear to have been kept up. 6. Both the Bani Bu Ali and Jenebeh tribes who inhabit Sur have been somewhat unruly subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, but in recent years there has been one fundamental difference between them. Whilst the Bani Bu AM appear to be united under their Amirs, the Jenebeh are divided amongst themselves by a blood feud which started about 1913 and has been kept un more or less ever since, ' i 7. In formor years the Jenebeh were united under a Temeemeh Shaikh chosen from the Majaala section who lived at Nezwa and Masirah. Jn the time of Colonel Miles the Temeemeh was Nasir bin Khamees who was regard ed with veneration and had despotic power. He resided near Nezwa and tookrjtfii—Ifciiu III IIW Mil—— BMinHtai i.Li immn m, ; mm &amp; 25 percent, on all bags of dates exported by the tribe. By 19C0 the influence of the Majaala section sterns to have waned and Mahmad bin Mubarak of the Aramah section (not Makh'annah section as Stated erroneously in Lorimer's Gazetteer, Vol. II, page 905) was the Temeemeh of the tribe. 8. Before his death last year Mansur bin Naser al Majaala of Masirah was the Temeemeh of the tribe but his influence over the Aramah section at Sur was negligible. Perhaps, for this reason, he entered into alliance with the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali, supporting them in their bid for independence from the Sultan and obtainiasr their support for the Makhannah and Ghialin sections in their feud against the Aramah and Puwaris. 9. Since his death, the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali have been attempting to foist their nomiree Shaikh Said bin Sultan bin Mahomad of Masirah on the Jenebeh. The same Shaikh whom they attempted, unsuccessfully, to foist on the tribe in 1925. The Aramah and Fuwaris sections first supported Saeed bin Sultan bin K ham is al Majaala as the new Shaikh, but recently one Shaikh Yaser al Majaala has come into prominence and assumed the leadership. 10. The attitude of the various personalities involved has been consistent throughout. The situation is similar to, though more advanced than that reported by Major Hinde in his letter No. 1436, dated 4th October 1924. • 11. It is clear from his own letters and actions that the Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin N?ser, is attempting to form an independent State for himself in Jaalan and is taking advantage of recent events (which he seems to have had a hand in engineering) in order to further this object. 12. These Amirs are by no means all powerful in Jaalan. Their action in attempting to seize control is likely to be resented by many tribes and there is every possibility of a general conflagration in that district. Such a possibility appears to be foreseen by Shaikh Isa bin Salih who in a letter to the Wali of Matrah dated 27th April 1928, asking about affairs at Sur, writes ' Pe haps it may draw to it what is quiet at present.' 13. It will be seen from Major Hinde's letter No. 1436, dated 4th Octo ber 1924, and Colonel Crosthwaite's letter No. 18, dated 8th February 1926, that it was hoped the purchase of a steamer would increase the State's control. In March 1926 Mr. Thomas wrote : ' The method of systematic land preven tion is not, I submit, conducive either to peace or to increase revenue. The paramount requirement for ' supporting customs ' and the economic means, is a small patr 1 steamer. This was theory. In actual practice the ' Al Saeed ' although armed with two maxims and a V gun has not imbued its Captain and crew with sufficient ardour to enable them to tackle a single dhow, or instilled sufficient awe in the tribes to prevent them firing on her. 14. The total armed force which the State could muster at present for despatch to Sur would be about 70 men. Such a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen, and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. I would be reluctant to advise the State to send it unless Government were prepared to support it with a man-of-war in case of need. 15. It is evident from their letter to me dated 21st April 1928, forwarded with my No. 68, dated 25th April 1928, that the Amirs are looking for support,, or at least an attitude of toleration, from the British Government for their action at Sur, and it seems to me that if a firm attitude is taken and it is made clear to the Amirs that their assumption of independence and authority over Sur will not he tolerated, a more serious conflagration may be averted.. I shall be glad of your instructions as to what attitude I am to adopt and what reply I am to give to the Amirs. 16. Should it be possible to send a man-of-war to take me to Sur, after receiving your instructions, the moral support of the presence of the man-of war would, I think, be useful.6 1 » A ppendix I. Historical summary of the Bani Bu All. A branch of the great Adnani tribe, Bani Temeem, which is now reduced to a few widely scattered remnants. The Bani bu Ali may have immigrated from Bahrein where the Bani Temeem were formerly strong. (Colonel Miles and Imams, and Saiyids of Oman, p. 3^9). 2. During the Wahabi invasion of 1812-1813, Silim bin Ali, Tamimah Shaikh of the Bani bu Ali, viho was hostile to the rule of the Imam Saivid Said, became their supporter, helping them against the Bani bu Hassan, 'in consequence of the part which Satim bin Ali took against the Bani bu Hassan there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a fight wherein Salim bin Ali and some of bis people were killed ; some of the Bani bu Hassan also fell and as neither side would give in the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 3. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali, as Tamimah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi, throwing off the authority of the Imam. 4. In 1820, Saiyid Said having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that the people of Sharkiyyah had submitted to him, and that his followers among the el Ashkarah had plundered many English ships wrecked there, applied to the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. The Bani bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports of piracy neir Has el Had. Captain Thompson, in charge of operations, decided to avenge the act and with a small force, consisting of six companies, sailed to Muscat where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The conibined force marched on Balad Bani bu Ali, j;he capital of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate and after attempting to take the town were sharply repulsed. ^ Six out of eight officers and 270 men were killed In January 1821, Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore BriLish influence in the Gulf Erom Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani lu Ali which surrendered after most of the defending force had been killed or captured. The Shaikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bombay (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Volume VI). 5. As late as 1845, the Bani bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance cf the Wahabi principles. They have since relaxed something rf their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco; but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer and are account ed the most religious tribe in Oman Sultanate. They belong to the Wahabi sect known as igraqah (Lorimer, Volume II, page 66). 6. In the early part of Saiyid Thoweynee's r.-gin the Bani bu Ali and the Bam bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other in which Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bm Ah, at the head of the Bani bu Ali generally won the day About the same time a series of ^ raids were committed by the A1 Waheebeh against the l&gt;ani bu All, these raids culminating in a serious engagement at Theeleveh m which Shaikh Abdullah greatly distinguished himself by totally defeatino- and routing the enemy. ^ . Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality but •Saiyid Salim during his reign having had reason to suspect treachery ?n u® :EI ! aawl g am son at Muscat, sent a laree present to Shaikh Abdullah and requested his help to defend him in his posi tion. Shaikh Abdullah gladly removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it, but owing to the vacillatory policy of Saiyid Salim was dismissed after a stay of 4 months and had to return to Jaalan. Soon after S 1S -^ ly / Z ^ aD - i 311 ^ ai . S 0n comin g to P 0 wer summoned him and the other Shaikhs of Bani bu Ah to Muscat to render their submission and on their having refused to visit him, he marched against the Bani bu Ali seized Majid, Thamees and Kashid bin Salim by treachery and threw them... m ii mi ii 111 1 into prison at Muscat. Shaikh Abdullah, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mntowwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani bu Hassan and the A1 Waheebeh to wage war against the Bani bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh in which Abdullah defeated the two fiinawi tribes, and in revenge for which the Bani bu Hasan rose again only to be defeated a secoiid time at Seh al Masaddee. 7 In 1^70 Saiyid Toorkee having requested the help of the Bani bu Ali they joined him at Sur and 200 of their number marchid under Sheikh Abdullah and Yoosuf against Matrah where they both took a leadinsr part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan bin Kais and subsequently restoring order and holding the place till Saiyid Toorkee's arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Tocrkee granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali exemption from the payment of Customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 8. In 1895 the Bani bu Ali sent detachments in support of Saiyid ' Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Sailh bin Ali but they made no deter mined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali an allowance of dollars 100 per mensem. 9. In the Spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Shariqiyah being then in progress, Abdullah bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris, were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied Mith. After Abdullah had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatain became so strained, that w^hen Major Cox arrived there in August, he found the two factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately pro ceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and, before proceedings had commenced in earnest, the Sultan w r as called away by serious news from Bustaq, nevertheless his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbourhood. (Lorimer, Vol. I, page 580.) 10. In 1913 Sheikh Abdullah bin Salim Al Alawi died. He was con sidered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him and as the latter's son Mahomed was still a minor, Abdullah's second son Ali w r as ma del Amir jointly with Mahomed bin ISIaser, an arrangement w^hich still continues. 11. During the 1913-19 rebellion the Bani bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but, since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations betweea the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 3920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani bu Ali through misdirected economy but Mr. Wingate restored it. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do w r iih the «aid Port ; that the Sultan did not supply them wdth arms and ammunition according to agreement; and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Govern ment replied that they w T ere unable to intervene on their behalf. 12. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde that he w^as authorized by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so wdth the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 otfering to effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied permitting him to inteivene during the ' Salifah ' period, but after this period he was not to interfere in anything. In 1925 Mahomed bin Naser also attempted to foist a Sheikh (Said bin Sultan bin Mahomed) on the ITenebeh at Sur. This Action was resented and failed.8 13. In September 1924 Major Hinde visited Sur and reported. &lt;£ I then enquired how it was I had received n^ws that the Sheikh did not permit the new Customs House at; Sur to be built. Mahomed bin Naser became evasive and said nothing had ever beeii sett ed about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and that he never would agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs at Sur and Aiqa had never been recognized by his forebears himself and his tribe.' 14. In 1925 Colonel Prideaux remarked that the Amirs were not veiy loyal to the Sultan and that if they had done their duty and given the Wali of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a Bedouin. 15. In December 1925 in protesting against having obtain a ' No Objec tion ' certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Government of India ; ' I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent state and it would be highly detri mental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political A?ent, iViuscat. I hold the Political Agent in high regard but I think you will appreciate that I prefer to preserve the dignity of my state, not to do an act detrimental to its independent position. Mahomed bin Naser has at present as his Lieutenants (1) Abdullah bin Saleh, a Habshi, who was his Agent in Bombay, speaks English and is leputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Naser's letter to the Government of India. (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about four months ago to teach his children. Reputed to know a little English and to be much travelled Appendix 11. Historical Summary of the JtnebeJi. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur who wero discontented with the Sultan's rule, sought Wahabi assistence from Baraim and the Wahabi agent, nothino- loth, sent a contingent who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by the Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu traders and shop keepers of the place, ho were British Indian subjects; the extent of their losses was estimated at dollars 27,700, and one of their number was killed and another was wounded. Before being allowed to leave for Muscat they were stripped of almost all their clothing. 2 It appeared to Colonel Pelly that a prompt and severe example should be made of those Arabs (of the Jenebeh tribe) who were implicated with the Wahabis m the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment of the Jenebeh. They had lone- been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who had conspired m 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti- si very proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H. M. S. - Wasp ' who had disappeared from their eratt a tew months before. The Sultan of Muscat was assured of their crimi nality and had himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat owine to a conspiracy to dethrone- him. Colonel Pelly had also in the preceding month sent the ' Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the Heads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of 27,000 dollars as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subjects, and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand. Their reply was That on a former occasion when Lieutenant Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast, nothing was done, and that they were quite sure the Resident would not come now. ^ ltJ 3. On the 11th of February 1866, H. M. S. ' Hiehflyer ' appeared nff &lt;W to insist on atonement by the Jenebeh for their part in the affai? of August, byI 9 payment of 27,700 dollars compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempt ing to procrastinate, a fire was opened which demolished their fort; the whole of their boats were either confiscated or destroyed ; and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. No. personal injury was suffered by non- combatants who had ample opportunity to move, but a small part of the town was burnt accidentally, in consequence of a change in the direction of the w'nl. 4. In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader at Sur, a bania named Jethanund Motamull, was broken into, during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of the Jenebeh tribe^ who offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about dollars 1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town, and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not eTe i appear that they offered to remonstrate with, or repress, their tribesmen, 5. There was no wali or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time, who could have taken action in the matter, and the bania therefore, on returning to Sur shot tly after the outrage and discovering his loss, reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His Highness who promised redress. 6. Soon after this H M. S. ' Rifleman' happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offenders and would have doubtless caused restitution to be made to the trader but H. M. S. ' Eifleman ' which only dropped anchor for a few hours inci dentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed and proceeded on her voyage, the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 7. During His Highness Saiyid Turki's absence at Guadar in 1875 the case was presented to His Highness Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without any beneficial result. About this time, however, the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This arrangement they afterward repudiated, H. H. Saiyid Turki was on different occasions reminded of the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss sustained at their hands, or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply to H. H. until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. 8. H. H. finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter in the hands of Government and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported H. H.'s request that the enforce ment tf reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held H. H. personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh's hands would have tended still further to weaken H. H.'s authority and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at H. H.'s expense ; while the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand, be a cautionary warning to all. Colonel W. P. Prideaux, the Political Resident, also suggested that besides the original amount a fine of dollars 2,000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as com pensation for the delay in settling (it was then October 1876) and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject, 9. At first, however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan's request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals in the dominion of Maskat was the duty of the Sultan; and that in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turki the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy, and for other material aid which had been afforded to H. H. from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would be 1 ^ ' Ml! — —— -effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for armed intervention. 10. The Sudan's efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective that finally in July 1877, the Political Agent was authorized by Government to proceed to Sur in H. M. ,S. ' Teazer ' and convey the Sultan's demands. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July, he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing H. H.'s order, and warned them that if they failed to comply to it within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognized head at the time, the nominal Shaikh being; a boy as yet without authority, but several^ of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readi ness to comply with H. H.'s order, but explained that the absence of a recog nized authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of re-imbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting with the Bani bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time, and were allowed until sunset on the 25th, 11. By noon of the 25th Jethanund's claim, amounting to dollars 1,600, had been satisfied, partly by a money payment,, and partly by a bughlah, of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Soor and Jethanund came on board. The former delivered to the Political Agent dollars 2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied. 12. Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that the fine of dollars 2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki, after deductions of the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 13. In 1898, the Jenebeh were making representations to the Sultan with a view to obtaining the recall of Suleiman bin Suwe7lim^s son who was, acting as bis father's representative in the Governorship of Soor. As the Sultan had declined to acquiesce in the demands of the Jenebeh and as in consequence of His Highness' attitude the situation had become critical, the Political Agent, Maskat, submitted to the Political Resident the following, brief history of the occurrences which led to the crisis. 14. On the 21st March, Suleiman arrived at Soor from Dhofar and on the 26th he summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that in future he would not respect Khafir and would seize the persons and pro perty of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly. I would here explain that the ' Khafir ' system of protection amounts to this, that when a parly or a caravan wish to pass through the country of another tribe and take with them as escort a man belonging to the tribe through whose country they wish to pass, that party or caravan is safe from attack and is so to speak sacred till it returns to its own country. 15. The ' Khafir ' is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe travelling under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe. 16. When the Jenebeh heard of Suleiman bin Suweylum's intention to disregard this' firmly established custom of the tribes of Oman, they asked the latter whether he really meant to imply that he would not respect the person and property of a tribesman coming into Soor under the protection of a member of their tribe, to which Suleiman replied that he would seize such a man even in the house of the ' Khafir ' himself. This answer, it is needless to say, aroused the greatest indignation among the Jenebeh. On the same day Suleiman left Soor and proceeded to Maskat leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years of age in charge of the Governorship of the place and on the 6th April Suleiman wrote (presumably with the consent of the Sultan) to his son at Soor and ordered him to build a fort at a spot which would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. On the11 10th of the same month Suleiman's son threatened to shoot a gardener and actually did shoot a bullock and cut down a date tree belonging to him because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. 17 This and otber arbitrary and highhanded acts on the part of Sulei man's son resulted in a combination between the iouvfahhaids or sections of the Jenebeh, the Sheikhs of which sent a letter to the Sultan on the llih April requesting him to issue orders to stop the building of the tort and to remove Suleiman's son from his post at Soor. His Highness mi vouchsafe a reply to this letter and the building of the fort continued. There is no doubt that the possession of a fort, so advantageously situated as the one in question, would have enabled the Sultan to overawe the Jenebeh and to ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Soor, the payment of which is at present evaded. The Jenebeh were quite aware ot this and on the 25th April they again wrote to the Sultan on the subject and again received no reply. On the 4th May Sheikh Musallan bin Abdullah with four other Jenebeh Sheikhs came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear to their representations and the Sheikhs returned disappointed to Soor. 18 The Jenebeh, seeing that the Saltan was un likely to accede to their demands, now proceeded to secure the goodwill and promises of co-operation from the Hishm and the Bani Rashid tribes through whose country it would be necessary for any expedition sent by land from Maskat against them to pass, but their Sheikhs still continued to send letters to the Sultan on the suhiect of their grievances and His Highness' well-wishers residing m the neighbourhood of Soor also wrote and advised him strongly to listen to the representations of this tribe. 19. At length the Sultan acting on the advice of his brother Seyyed Muhammad bin Toorkee and others, sent his head writer Hamed to Soor with instructions to hear what the Jenebeh had to state and to assure them that His Highness would be prepared to listen to any ^ specific charges they might make against Suleiman's son Hamed was also instructed to direct the latter to stop the building of the fort. No attention was however paid by Suleiman s son to this order and the building of the fort continued. In the meanwhile Suleiman, who was now in Burka, and had received the news of Hamed s mission to Soor, wrote a letter to the Sultan. The contents of this letter have not transpired but there is no doubt that, it had its influence on the Sultan, for when Hamed recurned, His Highness did not even trouble to hear his report of the result of his interview with Sheikhs of the malcontent tribe. 20. Matters were now beginning to assume a serious aspect and Sheikh Abdullah bin Salim, the ' Temeemeh ' or head Sheikh of the Bani bu Ali, a tribe residing close to Soor, who had rendered great assistance to the Sultan during the rebellion of 1895, now came to Muscat with a view of influencing His Highness to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards the Jenebeh but finding that the Sultan was on tour in Semail he wrote him a letter pointing out that all the disturbances which had of late occurred in Oman were the result of Suleiman's policy of unnecessary interference in the affairs of the tribes and warning His Highness that a continuance of his present policy towards the Jenebeh would onlv result in his losing the little control he possessed over that tribe. Sheikh Abdullah gave the Sultan clearly to understand that His Highness need expect no assistance from the Bani Bu Ali tribe in the event of his deciding to adopt coercive measures rgainst the Jenebeh. 21. This communication resulted in one concession being granted and Sheikh Abdullah returned to Soor the bearer of peremptory orders to Suleiman's son to discontinue work on the fort. But the Jenebeh were not to be pacified in so easy a manner. They knew that before long Suleiman or his son would set aside the Sultan's order and would recommence the building of the fort. They therefore informed Abdullah that nothing less than the recall of Suleiman's son would satisfy them. Abdullah communicated the failure of his negotiations to the Sultan and at the same time once more strongly urged upon His Highness the desirability of conforming to the wishes of the Jenebeh unless he desired a repetition of the Hhofar incident.12 22. On the 7fch Septexiiber Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, G »vernor of Semail aecompanied by four Sheikhs of lesser repute went to Soor to endeavour to conciliate the Jenebeh, but his efforts wern of no avail. The Sheikh told him that the tribe was quite prepared to fiiht rather than submit to Suleiman's rule. The Sheikh further pointed out that no reliance whatever could be placed on Suleiman and quoted as an instance of his bad faith the treacherous seizures at Suleiman's instisrations of S'leikh Salim bin Hamed and Oomerbin Abdullah at Dhofar. 23. On the 18th September the Sultan sent Sheikh Rashid bin tJzaiz to Burka to inform Suleiman of the failure of His Highness' efforts to con ciliate tha malcontent tribe and to ask for his advice. Suleiman was said to have advised the Sultan to use force against ihe Jenebeh and to be en- pgod m organizing an expedition for the purpose. On the 26th Septem ber news was receiv ed from Soor that th« Jen beh hadc. tolf supplies of the garrison at the fort. Tho Sultan at once sent off a messenger ' to the bheikh to warn bin that the present attitude o the tribe, if persisted in would only result in speedy and condun punishment. The messenger re- twrned on the 30; h without any reply, bu stat d that as soon as he had delivered his essage he was informed by the Sheikh that unless he left boor before nightfall his blood would be on his own head. His Hio-hness has now despatched a messenger fo order Suleiman bin Suweylim to return from Burka to Mask^t with all despatch. 24t. The Political Agent remarked at the time :— It is difficult to say what the result of this deadlock will be. The Jenebeh are not a martial tribe but they are well armed and they have sufficient money to induce other tribes to take their side. The Sultan as is well known has neither money nor troops. He may possibly be able to raise a force from the tribes residing m the Sohar district, but the men so raised will not come out with the intention of fi^htinff but merely with the intention of living at His Highness' expense On the whole therefore it may be surmised that the Sultan will be unsuccessful if he attempts to coerce the Jenebeh as was the case when he attempted similar measures against the Beni Euahah in 1896. It is difficult to understand why the Sultan persists in trying to force Suleiman hm Suweylim s rule on his subjects against their will This individual is at present Governor of Dhofar, Soor, and Sohar but resides for the most part at Sohar governing the other districts by proxy. His sway is most unpopular amongst the tribes whom he governs and his policy of unnecessary inter ference and high-handed oppression m the name of a ruler whose sovereignty over the tribes is at the best but shadowy and unsubstantial can only result in disaster and loss to the ruler whom he represents. 1 25 There is however, one aspect of the situation under report which must not be lost sight of, A large number of the Jenebeh tribe own dhows thirtv two of wh.ch fly the French flag. It is possible that the French Vice-ConS may be of opinion that French interests at Soor required to be safeguarded and may apply for the services of a man of war for the purpose. If such a ton ■sition were complied with it would in my opinion appear to be of the .,SV importance that we should adopt a similar precaution both in the interest of our own subjects and as a check on any possible design of the French f ,u 20 t ^ 0n 1 of the 4th 0c tober a force consistinff of 600 of the Jenebeh under Sheikh Saeed bin Naser ami Mn^ow, ^ u- ? 150 of the Beni Eahsih under M. SallbL y^er ^ Bani Boo Ali under Sheikh Hamed bin Abdullah with nl^ i His Highness the Sultan's fort at Soor garrisoned by Rahsib in which Suleiman bin Suw^eylim's son (the actino- WaliW 2o .^eni The rebels opened fire at a long range and the three hours without resulting in a'ny loss fo? eiCr ^Tdf the^Tt ludlSseemed to strike Saleli bin Yasser that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called .upon the garrison to surren der. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, Saleh bin Yasser guaranteeing that the Wal's son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the co s: and placed on board a vessel bound for Maskafc. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party embarked and arrived at Muscat on the 7th. 27 Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built ort re erred to above. The Sheikhs wro f e to the Sultan offering to ban I over the fort to any one deputed by His Highness to take it over except Suleiman b n Suweylim and his son and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison of 25 men under Hamad bin Saif Al Amri. The Sultan wrote a con ciliatory letfer to the Sheikhs informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion but it was generally believed that His Highness had only done this to put the Jenebeh off their guard and to attack them when they were unprepared for resistance. 23. On the llthj October Sheikh Abdullah bin Amir, the head Sheikh of the Beni Rahsib, called on the Political Agent and stated that he had been deputed by the Jenebeh to ascertain from him whether the British Govern ment had any intention of interfering in the quarrel between the tribe and the Sultan. He added that the Jenebeh felt quite able to hold their own against any attack that could bi made against them by His Highness by land, but being a maritime tribe they knew that they would be powerless to resist the Sultan if the latter were aided by our ships, as in the case of Dhofar. The Political Agent replied thot he was not in a position to give them any positive assurances on this point but that speaking generally he should say that any such inference would be very unlikely so long as British interests were uu- assailed and British subjects remained unmolested. 29. On the 20th October the garrison under Hamad bin Seif Al Amri which were despatched to take over the fort at Soor from the Jenebeh returned to Maskat and on the following day Sheikh Rashid bin Muhammad, a wealthy Arab merchant of Jissa, who had also been sent to Soor to endeavour to con ciliate the Je tebeh arrived with a letter to the Sultan from Saeed bin Naser, the head Sheikh of the tribe in which the latter while thanking His Highness for the free pari on granted to the tribe informed him at the same time that His Highness' garrison could not be allowed to take possession of the fort uutil the Jenebeh were first as sured under the guarantee of theBritish Government that no atiempt would in future be made to re-appoint Suleiman bin Suweylim as Governor of Soor. 30. Sheikh Rashid further informed the Sultan that the young bloods of the rebel tribe were in favour of destroying the Sultan's fort and assuming an attitude of defiance against His Highness' authodty, but that they were overruled by the elders who sent the letter of which he was the bearer. 31. On the same day the Sultan received a communication from the custom's farmer stating that the Jenebeh Sheikhs had directed him to withhold payment of the customs receipts from the Sultan with the exception of the amount collected as punitive tax for compensation of British subjects for losses during the late rebellion. 32. Two Sheikhs of the Jenebeh who flew French flags on their dhow and were therefore under French protection arrived at Muscat on the 21st with Rashid bin Muhammad. They both paid visits to Mons. Ottawi but not to the Sultan. The object of their visit to Muscat was .not known but it was believed that they had come to purchase arms and ammunition and to watch events. 33. Saiyid Muhammad bin Hamad, accompanied by a garrison of 60 men, took possession of .the fort at Soor on the 25th November. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled, all the wood work having been carried away and nothing left but the bare walls. The Sultan sent 20 barrels of gunpowder and 4,000 ball cartridges for the use of the garrison at Soor and 'Ordered the wali to place the fort in repair.34). During this period, the authority of the Sultan at Sur was being' further ui dermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at Sur, published by the French Government in 1901 showed that then' atten tion had been directed to that place at some earlier date and in 1893 M. Chapui, a somewhat disreputable French subject arrived at Snr in a steamer flying the French flag and tried, but without success to obtain a site for a coal shed there. The scheme for advancing French interests by a wide distribution of the French flag was now bo'dly pursued. From 1892 onwards, abundant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of the French flag by the im orters of slaves at Sur and in 1896 two Suri vessels under the French flag were captured by a, British vessel in the act of carrying slaves 35. In 1900 Captian P. Z. Cox re-examined the question of the importa tion of slaves. He found that about 1,000 slaves had been imported that year into Sur, of which about half had been ca ried in vessels under the French flag. In 1901 about 1,000 slaves were again imported whilst in 1902 it was reported that the supply of slaves was abundant. 36. In 1902, 114 Arabs w T ere captured by the Poituguese in Mozninbique whilst actuary engaged in slave trading About a thitd of them died in confinement while the remainder 54 were sentenced to transportation for 25 years. With a few exceptions, these men belonged to the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali tribes of Sur. The number of the captives who might have claimed French protection was never ascertained but it was admitted by one of them before the Por' u uese authoriiies that two of the vessels captured flew the'French flag 37. In the Administration report for 1902-03, Captain Grey wrote ; ' This port 'rom wiiich there is a considerable direct import and export trade, and which should be an important factor in the Suban's revenue continues to bring him little or nothing, and must inevitably remain a bad bargain to His Highness unless and until the much discussed question of the French flag in Oman is brought to a definite adjustment. So long as a large sprinkling of the chief inhabitants of this turbulent corner of Oman can evade the Sultan's jurisdiction and set his local governor at defiance in matters of administration, fiscal or otherwise, on the plea that they and their families and their property are under French protection, so long will they continue to leaven the whole population with a spirit of disregard lor constituted authority, and make it impossible for the ruler of Muscat to bring the administration of Sur to that state of reasonable efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium de mands, and which wonld otherwise be possible. 88. About 1913 a blood feud started between the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeb which has continued ever since. In 1918 His Highness the Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Rs. 14,000 and imprison ed 26 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years. 39. In 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganized and the people of Sur, seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced refused to allow a customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain Mac Collum, the then Wmir went to Sur in H, M. S. 44 Britomart ' and the Jenebeh agreed to accept the new arrangements Things went smootlily for a short while and then smuggling began again and had continued ever since. The customs hcuse was not built, difficulties being invariably placed in the way, and the Wali became as powerless and inept as ever, 40. Spasmodic murdering went on, and in 1923, the Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to endeavour to put an end to the feuds. He returned having been openly flouted and having accom plished nothing. In July Zuber, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban and 150 levies and three machine guns, proceeded to Sur and occupied the fort. Zuber reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered 6,400 dollars custom dues from the merchants and fined the tribe 4,000 dollars. A site was selected for a custom touse and the party returned to Muscat in triumph. Unfortunately there was one case in which blood money was not accepted. The Makhanab agree to pardon the murderer, an Arama. lie was imprisoned in Muscat buttvas released in 1924. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscrim'nate firing between the sections in which an Arama boy was killed. The Fuwaris then took a hand and seized a water donkey belongmir to the Arama and a struggle ensued in which an Arama girl was killed. The W r ali was able to use the Eamzan fast for arrang ing a 45 days armistice. 41. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Naser, Amir of the Bani bu Ali started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhanah and A1 Ghialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud among the Jeneb h—to acknowledge his aut'eority. 42. In 1925, Sheikh Mansur bin Naser went to Sur, informed the Hindu community that there was no Sultan's Government in 8ur and that they were to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of justice as the local wali had been found incapable. The . * J 2; Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. 43. In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah (mentioned above) accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salim bin Naser, brother of Mahomed ^ Ali stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Ma]esty Ibn Saud. Mansur* bin Naser die! of small pox on the return journey. ■ APPENDIX III. Summary op recent events in Sur. In 1927, the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh each built three new torts in their quarters against the orders of the Wali. Z. In August 1927, Mr. Thomas, Minsiter of Finance went to Sur As it transpires afterwards, one of his objects was to arrange for a journey which he proposed making overland from Sur to Dhofar for which he required the assistance of the Banibu Ah. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay ® ld * hs of ™Pees which they owe Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan merchants of Muscat, and tried to induce them to pull down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section and on leaving Sur, in the A1 Saeed, he tookin tow an Arama sambuk lying m the harbour, whereupon the A1 Saeed was fired on by the Arama section. 3. The Council of Ministers fined the Arama section Es. 10,000 and ordered the destruction of their three torts but they hare not been able to doing so S 10 the :British ^''aent to assist them in 1928. ,, A 4 - . 0n t . h , e L 1 ^ th .

If you remain on what I see you, no will subjects or obedience MMri be left for you. This is an important matter and you do not move and do not fear about your customs. If you mean to iceep subjects, you should come to Sur, so that the people should see that you are not neglectful of your town and your subjects. Verily a wise man is his own doctor. And Salams.

By the Grace of God the affairs in bur have 'been settled and the peace with the Jenebeh is about to be completed as we^ and Sheikh Saeed bin Sultan and Yaser bin Hamud al Majaala have become of one opinion and now we are trying to make peace. We thank Saiyid Hamad bin Hilal, wali of Sur as he tried very much to subside this trouble. when Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal arrived here we in presence of Sheikh itashid bin Uzaiz and Abdullah bin iiumaid, had authorised him to intervene and effect peace, but he referred the matter to Your Honour. By the Grace of God there is nothing here except all good. We request you not to listen to what the mischief makers report to you. As regards the fine which we demanded from the Arama about iffazir Thomas, Sheikh iiashid and Saiyid Shahab referred it to you. Let it be known.

After the departure of 3aiyid Shahab, the wali Saiyid Hansad bin Hilal, Al Hashim and Bani Kasib intervened and extended the armistice for 45 days accord- •ing to the custom among the Majaala and Al Jenebeh# They asked us to demolish the fortification on the house of ahamis bin kubarak of Al Arama# and also asked Al Mukhannah to demolish the fortifications on the house of Wald Bahwan. we in order to subside the trouble agreed to comply. Thus matters were settled between ourselves and Al Hamudah. The H Khor H is now open to both sides i.e. Bani bu Ali and the Jenebeh. We thank Saiyid Haraad bin Hilal.

As regards the wali, the one with us at present is sufficient and we do not want anybody else. There is now no necessity for your coming. It will only cost expenses, we ask you to keep baiyid Hamad with us and his pay may be increased and fortifications repaired. We are his help, ! by the Grace of Godf in addition to the Askar. we are for you in all circumstajnces. As regards Mikhannah and Ghiyalinj they require a lesson as they do not count that Government is over them. This is 4ue to your Aatjui dealing in an easy going way. we shall, God willing, let Saiyid Hamad remain with us. He is a good man.

Dickson, CJ.I.S., Secretary to the Hon'hle the Political Eesident, Persian Gulf and H.B.M•s Oonsul General for Pars, etc. A. 0. I am yery grateful to the Hon'hle Lt-Colonel Sir Lionel Haworth for his kindnerss in allowing me to hare an interview with him on last Wednesday. As he was kind enough to enquire into the objects of the Amirs of Sur Jaalan for which I have 'been deputed 'by them I explained the facts very briefly to him as there was very little time owing to his departure to Shiraz, 'but I was confident! that I could put the same matters 'before you in writing so that you may refer to them in time of need. The Hon'ble the Political Resident told me that after the summer season and the presence of H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Wazir Thomas, he and the Political Agent Muscat will visit Sur Jaalan for the purpose of settling the trouble and disputes between the Amirs of Jaalan and the Sultan of Muscat and investigating the proofs and documents which are in possession of both | parties. He promised to send an answer through you to the letter of the Amirs. It would be an honour to the Amirs if he comes there and see the original documents and investigate the real facts of both parties. I am now explaining the facts in the statement which I beg to forv/ard it herewith. U.E.The objects of the Amirs of Sur Jaalan are as follows: (1) The Amirs of Sur and Jaalan request Your Honour that a modification should 'be made in the form of correspondence and address to them that is they should 'be addressed as 'Amir' which was the title of their fathers as they used to 'be addressed in the past 'by the Government representati ves and others. The letters should 'be despatched to them directly and not through anyone according to the present practice which was adopted this year because this practice will 'be a disgrace to them and divulge their secrets with the High Government. (2) The Amirs in the name of friendship and Justice request Your Government that whatever organization that may make in their country should not he considered a highhandedness, tresspass or against the interests of Great Britain or discomfort to your subjects who are living there. Any representations which may he made 'by self-interested persons are unfounded and incorrect. (3) The Amirs request Your Honour to instruct the Bunnia ; who usurped the dues of Hakman without any reason and against whom there was a case through the Political Agency Muscat;to pay whatever is due from him# After payment of the ranson which was demanded hy the Political Agency the defendant did not come to make a settlement in his case as was arranged 'by the Political Agency and the Oouncil of Ministers 'but after depositing the amount of ransom with the Wali they (the Agency and the Ministers) insisted upon taking the amount which they did without the information of the Amirs. As the Hakman are dependents of the Amirs and living in Jaalan and in the neighbourhood of Musirah they are always demanding their dues from the Amirs and asking either to 'be paid 'by them or the Bunnia. (4) The Amirs request that a No Objection Certificate for the arms which was granted to them by the Government last year should be sent to them. The Political Agent Muscat wrote to them that the arms would be grantedon oondition that the ransom of the Bunnia would 'be refunded The amount was paid although it had nothing to do with the question of the grant of the Government, hut they have not received the arras as yet as the Consul guaranteed to them. (5) The Amirs request you to advise your friend, Sayid Taimur, Sultan of Muscat, to hand over the cartridges which was purchased for them on payment through the late Sayid Faisal and has 'been kept with him in deposit since 1331 (1913). Sayid Taimur according to his letters intends to pay money to them instead of the cartridges 'but they do not require money as they are in need of the cartridges which were 'bought 'by their own money. (6) The Amirs request Your Just Government to certify on certificates which are issued 'by them to their subjects and dependents owners of 'boats similar to those of the Sultan of Socotra and others 'because their subjects experience great difficulties in getting certificates from Muscat. Moreover if .'becomes necessary for the Amirs to go on journey it would he a disgrace to them to take a passport from other Chiefs and count themselves as subjects of Muscat. The Amirs do not agree to this as it would 'be an insult to them and their family. (7) The Amirs request Your Honour to despatch the letter addressed to the Italian representative at Magdesho with regard to the claim of Bashid 'bin Abdullah bin Bashid and Saleem bin Abdullah bin Mater of Beni Bu Ali who were plundered last year by the Somalis during the fight with the Italians with a request to pay the dues of the Amirs' subjects like others who were plundered during the Somalis fighting. As the claimants are always approaching the Amirs about their dues and they (Amirs) are afriad that they (claimants) may molest the Somalis who are making traffic to these parts they request you to communicate with the representative of the said Government and obtain a reply from him before the termination of this season as the Somalis will shortly visit these parts.Transjation of letter dated ISth Hamaaan 1346 (6.3.28) from Rashid 'bin A'bdullah 'bin Kashid and Saleem 'bin AlDdullah 'bin Mater of Beni Bu All, to the Amirs Sxm all 'bin Ahdullsia 'bin Salim and Muhammad 'bin Nasir 'bin A'bdullah hin Salim All Hamudah,- After oompliments# We 'beg to write this letter from Zanzibar and to inform you that 2)n arrival at Magdesho, the Italian territory, we found out that the Italian G-overnment have paid oompensation to those who suffersd in the Somalis fighting* ¥e did not get anything as our case was referred to the Muscat authorities. Please enquire from the Muscat authorities as to whether they have recovered our dues or not. If n&amp;t they should demand it as we did not get anything and our case is outstanding in the Court of the Council of Ministers of Oman. Usual ending.-Bushire 9 the 16th June 1928* the 27th Zil HeJjeh 1346 Q 1 To The Amirs of Jaalan. A. 0» I hope that you are enjoying the 'best of health. Your messenger Abdullah 'bin Salih arrived Bushire and I had the pleasure of seeing him. He also delivered your letter to the Hon'hle Lt-dolonel Sir Lionel Haworth, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and had a personal intervi «rw with him and explained all matters to him. As the Hon'hle the Political Resident was on the point of leaving for Shiraz he took all the papers with him to that place where he will deal with the matter and will send an official answer to your letter in due course^ Your messenger also handed over a cover to me addressed to the Italian representative at Magdesho in connection with a claim of your subject. I hope to take the necessary action in the matter. I have also made enquiries from him ahout the arms, and a reply will 'be sent through the Political Agent Muscat^- ^ Jba* You will 'be pleased to hear that I have recently received a letter from Wazir Thomas, who is a very great friend of mine, in which he has told me all ahout pour country and the very interesting Journey which he recently made into the interior of S.S. Arabia and of the help and assistance he received from you. ¥azir Thomas'sinformation has made me all the more anxious to visit your country AttcO*- and when H .E. the m#* el KhaliJ next visit your port, I shall Insha-allah accompany him and make your acquaintance.

The first reply from the Council did not appear to me to cover the subject fully enough and I had therefore to write and obtain a further reply. Whilst in Bombay, His Highness the Sultan himself broached the subject of Sur and I took the opportunity to obtain from him his views on the subject in writing. J The Council have been reluctant to express their views fully in writing without first obtaining the views of His Highness the Sultaa ; whilst His Highness considered lie had given the Council full powers and wished them to act on their own initiative. The views of the Sultan and the Council are identical. They resent the letters and actions of the Amirs of Ja'alan but realize that they are not strong enough to deal with the situation without the support and assistance of ihe British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance, the little control which the Muscat Government exercises over Sur will cease. A number of Arabs in Oman are of opinion that the British Government are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they would countenance the formation of another independent authority in Ja'alan. This, I have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Ja'alan. The Council o not consider that the Amirs of Ja'alau have sufficient influence over other tribes to establish themselves firmly as independent rulers ot Ja alan, but fear that the Imam's Government might interfere and obtain mastery over Sur. u The loss of revenue from Sur and the possible deviation of trade f om Muscat to Sur would be a heavy blow to Muscat revenues. The prestige of the Muscat State rests on the support, moral and physical, which they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the State is 11x1t}0130111) • f !i a ? 0 J ?P inion that unle f the State receives some .support to enable them to withstand the aggressions of the Amirs, their authority will diminish not only in Ja alan but also in ot^er parts of their ^errito.ncs.

Gazder, representative of the Political Agent, Muscat, in his absence. After Complements. We have the pleasure to reply to your letter No. C.-97, dated the 13th June 1928, in which you asked us, in accordance with the instructions of the Political Agent, to inform you of the opinion of the Council in respect of the letter of the Beni Bu Ali Shaikhs of Ja'alan and their deeds. Indeed we understand from their letter that they demand 10,000 riyals to meet the expenses of their halting at Sur to fight the Irama. Decision of the Council is as under :— 1. The Council does not accept this proposal and demand as it has no precedence. 2. After their arrival at Sur, as soon as we received reports of their deeds, we sent some Deputies in order to enquire from them about this action and inform them that the Council does not wish that any measure be taken now at Sur, hut they did not listen to the orders of the Council and persisted in their intentions. They even said that if the Government do not agree to their occupation their demands should he granted. Finally Sayid Shahab and Shaikh Rashid asked them to stop hostilities for two days in order to refer the matter to the Council but without result. 3. When they (Deputies) saw their persistence in their demand they discussed the question of the Customs which they had established at Aiqa but they did not give any answer and made a truce between themselves without reference to the Government. Keeping their objects in view they are making preparation to attain their ends and the Government of Muscat has not taken any action in the matter up to now. We have received a letter dated the 14th Dhil Hejjeh 1346 from Shaikh Isa bin Salih at Harithi in which he says ' If you neglected the matter I should not be blamed (for any action which may be taken by me). Sur is a port of call for us and our tribesmen. You should help us against those who have been aggressive and rebelled against their masters. Negligence is not advisable in every affair.' The Council has therefore arrived at the decision that if the Government do not take any measure to check the move ments of Beni^ Bu Ali, the result will be very bad as the Omanis who do not like the suzerainty of Beni Bu Ali at Sur may take advantage of this opportunity to make interference at Sur. After one week we will depute Sayid Shahab bin Eaisal as Wali for Sur. Usual ending. ANNEXUU II. ^ T ranslation of a letter from the C ouncil of M inisters to H.

We trust that you are in perfect health. Captain Walker attended the Majlis yesterday and stated that you had asked him to enquire from the Council of Ministers about the state of affairs at Sur, and about the sons of Abdullah bin Salim al Hamuda, Amirs of Beni Bu Ali, the situation of Sur and its importance to the Government of Muscat, the recent events which took place there and continues up to now, the objects of the sons of Hamuda and their intentions at Sur, the effect of their inter ference and actions, views of the Majlis as to what measure should be taken for checking the said individuals and what support the Government of Muscatshould expect from the High British Government as they used to give in important affairs, and that the views of the Majlis are required before any action be taken in the matter. We therefore submit to you oar views and opinions in details on the subject. Usual Ending. Decision of Majlis. The port of Sur is an important port to the Government of Muscat and is considered to be the third port in importance after Muscat and Matrah from a commercial point of view as it is a port in which goods are imported from the Eastern Oman and an important bazaar for its tribes. Goods are imported into Sur by land as well as by sea and also exported from it. The Government of Muscat receive a considerable amount of revenue from Sur. This is from the economical and commercial point of view. As regards its political situation Sur is one of the important ports to the Government of Muscat as it is a resort for all tribes of that part who arrive and depart there for the purpose of transaction of business. Eor that reason the Government of Muscat had absolute influence and control over that part. The inhabitants of Sur are almost the four sections of the Jenabah tribe and are obedient to the Government who make peace and settle their internal disputes whenever they arise between them. As regards the sons of al Hamuda, Chiefs of Beni Bu Ali of Ja'alan, they were since olden times obedient to the orders of and friendly to the Muscat Government. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim father of these Chiefs was especially a faithful friend of the Muscat Government. He used to assist with his followers in affairs concerning the Muscat Government whenever he was called upon to do so and maintained that attitude till the end of his life. The Muscat Government in recognition of his services sanctioned a monthly allow ance for him. When he died his sons, viz. Ali bin Abdullah and Muhammad bin Nasir succeeded him and at the beginning of their mle followed in the footsteps of their late father in consequance of which the Government agreed to pay the same allowance to them which their father used to get it. Their behaviour has recently changed at the instigation of some one and consequently they have put forward some claims which they have no right to do nor their fathers who were before them had enjoyed such privileges. In 1924 hostilities and fighting broke out between the two tribes namely A ramah and Makhanah which continues up to now. The sons of Hamudah asked the Government of Muscat for permission to make peace between the aforesaid tribes and the Council accorded this to them. This request was made by them both verbally and in writing and their letters are on the record of the Majlis*. They i.iterferedat the beginning in the affairs of Sur in this way but they had another object in view and that was their absolute control over Janabah and Sur. They were not contented with this but established a Customs House at Aiqa for collecting revenue and notified openly to that effect. Owing to the hostilities between the Aramah and Makhanah they have recently entered Sur with their force in order to establish their authority over the inhabitants pretending that they had been ordered by the Government of Muscat to make peace between al Aramah and al Makhanah tribes but they have got a different object in view. They have commenced hostilities and fighting with those who did not comply with their wishes. The Majlis then sent Deputies to Sur to investigate into the affair but they (Beni iiu Ali) told them that they were acting according to the orders of the Government. The Deputies asked them to stop the fighting which was against the wishes of the Government but they did not obey and thus their secret intentions that is their control over Sur, collection of revenue and aggression to the inhabitants became known. In view of the foregoing facts it is necessary that the condition of Sur should be put risrht and saved from these transgressions because Sur is considered as one of the limbs of the Muscat Government and no other authority but the Government of Muscat should rule over it..19 As to the political point of view, Sur is a centre for all affairs concerning the Eastern parts as has already been stated by us. The Muscat Government can exercise their authority over those parts and their people who are great m number as long as Sur is under their control, and do not wish to cease their relations with them. f^ 6 M ld tr i b n them5,eh J es do n( ? t a g re e to any other authority at Sur besides the Muscat Government especially the Oman tribes who will rot neSertd of stepping into Sur if the Government neglected it and therefore the Muskat Government are obliged to take stens to keep off the Shaikhs of Beni Eu Ali from Sur. in. Prom the financial point of view there is no doubt that losses would rn*f?m rr TT ^ c .° lldlt t I 1 0tl if ch anged at Sur and particularly if another Customs House besides the Government's would be established there. If a rtTwl wm T 6 - 'fiw ' Skat Govemmen(; b e established near Sur the boats will visit that Customs without the information of the Government y ^ an op en wa y ior dealing in the prohibited trade which ^ e .Government of Muscat has undertaken to suppress it. The Arabs as it is their habit were endeavouring to find a means to do so It should be known Kmi E?, S A« n i ^ • h u atJa,alan and Chiefs oC their own tribe Bern Bu Ah only. They have no right to exercise any control over Sur and and thf TW p ' 1611 t ^ W i thdraw their authority the tribes of Ja'alan rise ao-ain^ th Oman who are stronger than them (Beni Bu AH) will r n Ji he Co + U ?i? il 0 l Mi n D i sters are of 0 P inion tha t b y the assistance of the British Government they should proceed by a Man-of-war to Sur where thev would discuss matters with the subjects and effect a settlement in the disputes between them m any way that the Government deem advisable and if some of them do not agree to the adjudications of the Government they should be punished. Then the sons of al Hamudah should be warned to Lfrai ? n from interfering with the affairs of the subjects of Sur, to abolish the Casto^ House winch they had established at Aiqa, to pull down the building which hey had erected at the entrance of the creek as there was no such building a * ?

I have to inform you by this letter to confirm our personal con- Tersation regarding Sur affairs and the interference of the Shaikhs ?, p 11 211 Al1 - 1 , h °P e y 1 ' 1 klnd| y submit this information to our friend the Government and draw their attention with a view to favour us with com plete assistance to prevent the said people from their action and to do aww have noright todo 1611 ^ W at SUr and Jailabah whicb they I have received a'letter from the Council of Ministers of a 19th Dhil Qadeh 1346 (8th June 1928) describing the trouble which has been of e Sur wfthn 6 *- / f enl BU Ali in figiltil1 ^ with the Janabah, subjects of Sur, without any order from me or the Council of Ministers. Thev have also prevented the Janabah s boats from entering the creek and have destroyed20 their properties which were lying near the State fort where the Wall resides They have levied a tax on vessels which enter the creek and have established a Customs House at Aiqa. All these actions are against us and disturb our State's administration.' JBeni Bu Ah have no right to intertere in Sur affairs without our permission or from our representative at that place. As you know Beni Bu Ali are subjects of Muscat as other tribes are and whenever their assistance is required in any matter they have to execute our order at Sur or other countries. I now request H. B. M.'s Government to afford us strong support in order to prevent the Shaikhs of Beni Bu All iiom any action which thev intend to take at Sar district as they have no historical right to do so. The pressure which has been brought by Beni Bu All on the Janabah is due to the fact that they think that we would not get any support from the Government. You are well aware that our Government had request ed for help in connection with Sur affairs since a long time and without the Government assistance they would not be able to prevent them and manage affairs concerning the Customs administration, etc. If the Janabah tribe now get the least assistance from us they would never submit to Beni Bu Ah s demands. , The Council of Ministers forwarded to me the letter which they ha^ received from the Shaikh of Beni Bu Ali demanding payment of expenses which they had spent during their fighting with the Janabah as they considered that their last action was by order of our Government. If their statement was true they would not have opposed the Deputies of my Government Ministers during their last agressions at Sur. Under these circumstances we will never accept their demand because we did not order them at all, and if they had been ordered by my Government to rise against the Janabah there would have been a representative on our behalf with them. If our friend the Government will not attempt to assist my state in the affairs of Sur and its dependencies at an early date the result will be unsatisfac tory. You are aware about the opinions of the Shaikhs of other tribes in connection with the actions of this (Beni Bu Ali) tribe, and the weak ness of our Government and lack of support from our friend H. B. M.'s Government. Therefore I have sanguine hope that the Government will not procrastinate in this important point to which my Government as well as the British Government is giving due attention. The cause of delay in w riting this letter is due to fact that I wished to discuss the matter with you personally. In reality the Council of Ministers used to send reports to me since the beginning of the trouble asking for a de finite answer but I did not send any as I considered that they had been fully authorised by me to take action in important affairs. They have undoubtedly explained the whole facts to you. I have now deemed it necessary to acquaint you with what was necessary so that you may kindly communicate it to our friend the Government. In conclusion I hope that sincerity and friendship w 7 ill endure between both parties. GIPB—674(C) FiPD—7-11-28 SO.3 • ' No.E/ 3 4 of 19s.8, Political Agency &amp; British Consulate, I .uscat.

Ibn Saud cannot intervene and the Amirs of Jaalan cannot face economiic pressure. / I did not want to force the situation till the return of the Sultan, when he tod the Resident could deal with it together but fighting between the tribes of Jaalan and the tribes of the interior is undesirable as it may cause a general conflagration in the Sur district. I will now ask Senior Naval Officer to pro- -ceed to Muscat. If necessary the Political Agent can accompany the Council of Ministers and, if you approve, will inform the Amir that he must make a truce and leave all action in the matter until the return of the Sultan of Muscat misLfe otherwise no Bani Bu Ali ship will be allowed to take any cargo at Bombay, Mombasa, Zanzibar or any other port. Their dhows are leaving or have already left Stmcx sur./Sur• Please telegraph your approval of this proposal, which may 'bring ahout truce.

Isa hin Salih, leader of the imam's ■ Government of the interior of Oman, has written to the Muscat Council saying that the hoisting of a foreign flag hy the Bani Bu Ali trihe cannot 'be tolerated and that if the Muscat State does not do something, he will. The Council are. greatly worried over this. Isa 'bin Salih has also written on the subject to the Political Agent. t I have written to Isa 'bin Salih telling is heing him that the matter Max not tesis neglected, that Ihn Saud is in treaty with us not to attack Oman and that we wish to tide matters over till the return of the Sultan. My ohject is to prevent his taking action which may 'bring ahout a conflagration. I have since telegraphed to the Council to inform Isa that the main thing for the present is to avoid any fighting which would excite the Ikhwan and make it difficult for Ihn Saud to control them. I have also written to the Bani Bu Ali Shaikhs telling them that we will not tolerate in Sujr any government other than that of the Sultan of Muscat and that they had 'better display some wisdom. Fighting has already started ahout six \ miles outside Sur 'between the Bani Bu Ali and a rival trihe, the Bani Bu Hassan, hut this is Unimportant.

I have told ttie PolitiGal Agent to ¥/arn the Oouncil that they nmst Hisi only discuss matters and must not get engaged in any trxj fighting, for which the Muscat State is totally unequipped either in leadership or in numbers. It is hoped and indeed anticipated that my letters will have effect in holding up matters till the return of the Sultan. It now appears that of all the trihes of Sur the Bani Bu All are the least affected hy a blockade, 'but such 'bolckade would make Sur useless to them, a fact which I have pointed out to them. While the situation is unpleasant similar situations have occurred at Sur many times 'before and it has no ultimate danger so long as the Ikhwan are not aroused 'by fighting taking place over the Ikhwan flag. If this were to occur and the Ikhwan could m not 'be controlled 'by Ihn Saud we should have to consider the matter very seriously. This contingency, however, is yet remote so I will deal with it separately. However remote we must he prepared for it so that if it does occur we will not he taken 'by surprise.

I.—Geographical Description of Sur. 1. Sur is a town of about 12,000 inhabitants situated in the province of Jaalan in Oman, about 17 miles west of Has el Hadd and 94 miles south-east of Muscat. 2. The shore at Sur is low and sandy, destitute both of trees and other vegetation. The principal features of the place are a creek with the town standing on both sides of the entrance and a stony ridge called Eed, which rises about 50 feet high from shingly flats and runs from north to south at a distance of 2 miles behind the town. The creek is half a mile long, 150 yards wide and only three-quarters of a fathom deep at low water. 3. The town on the east of the creek is called Aiqa and is occupied by the Bani Bu AH tribe; that on the west is called Muqrirnatain and is occupied by four sections of the Jenebeh tribe. The fighting strength of these sections is stated to be as follows Aram a, 2,000 ; Makhana, 800 ; Ghialin, 600 ; Fnwaris, 150. 4. Adjoining the north-west end of the stony ridge are Sanaisalah, occupied by the Bani Sinan, and Shariah, containing 100 houses of the Jenebeh (Arama). 5. On the plain at the back of the ridge, situated about 4 miles from the sea, is Balad As Sur, a stone-built village in which the Wali's residence is situated, but in disrepair. There is also a fort named Jinah situated inside Balad As Sur and occupied by the Bani Amr, askaris of the Wali. Stated to be the key to the command of Sur. 6. There are extensive date groves and cultivation of lucerne and about 250 houses of various tribes who supply Sur with vegetables and fodder. 7. Balad As Sur contains about 95 wells and the water supply of Sur is obtained from there daily on donkeys. It was in order to keep the town in check by commanding the -water supply that this site was chosen as the Wali's residence. During hostilities water is also obtained at night with some difficulty from sweet wells to the south of the creek. 8. According to Lorimer's Gazetteer (Vol. II, p. 1849), there were at one time over 100 Indian traders at Sur, but these numbers gradually dwindled down owing to the insecurity of the place. In 1923 there were 35, at present there are only 20 British subjects in Sur. These British merchants are living on sufferance, having to pay blackmail to the various. Sheikhs of the Jenebeh in order to avoid being looted. I understand that since the kidnapping of a Bania in 1926, Mahomed Bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, has not himself levied anything from the Banias, but that he is suspected of instigating others to do so. 9. The climate of the place is stated to be very equable, and were it not for the insecurity trade there would be in a very flourishing condition.* 10. Unlike Muscat, there are roads suitable for wheeled traffic in Muqrimataiu. The track between Muqrimatain and Balad As Sur would require some labour on it near Sanaisalah before it could be used for wheeled traffic. 10 a . Sur is the port for the shipment of dates from Sharqiyah. Most of these dates are of the Mibsali variety, which is preferred by natives of the country to all other kinds and is much appreciated in India. The trade is a large one, the Badiyah division of Sharqiyab alone containing some 158,000 palms. 10 b . The carrier trade from Sharqiyah to Sur is in the hands of the Hijriyin tribe, whilst the Jenebeh of Sur, who are a seafaring tribe and own some 130 dhows, convey them thence to Bombay and other ports. * The total number of Snr dhows is estimated at 150. Most of these belong to the Jenebeh tribe. The Bani Bu Ali own 8 or 10. and a few are owned by the Bani Sinan.10c. A small number of Jenebeli belonging to the Majaala section live at Izz near Nezwa, and in former clays the Temeemah or Chief Sheikh •of the Jenebeh was chosen from this section. He was regarded with veneration, had despotic power, and took 25 per cent, on all bags of dates exported by the tribe. Presumably he acted as agent for the Jenebeh in ■Sharqiyah and helped to build up this trade. By 1900 his power had waned and a Sheikh of the Arama section, who are the largest section in Sur, was recognised as Temeemah. Unfortunately a blood feud, which started in 1913,. between the Arama and Fuwaris sections on the one hand and the Makhana and Ghialin on the other, undermined the influence of the Arama Sheikh and Mansur bin Naser of the Majaala section of Masirah Island was elected Temeemah. The influence of this Sheikh over the Arama and Fuwaris sections waned, and he seems to have enlisted the sympathy of the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali tribe for the purpose of regaining his authority. In 1927 he went to Mecca with the brothers of Amir Mahomed bin Naser to visit Ibn Saud, but died of smallpox on the return journey. The Jenebeh, though they bear an evil reputation in slave dealing and piracy, are not a warlike race, and under normal circumstances could have been kept in control easily enough ; but misrule, internal feuds and French influence have combined to let loose lawless elements amongst them. . 10d . The Bani Bu Ali, as a tribe, live in the interior of Jaalan. Their principal port is Lashkharab, but they have a small settlement at Aiqa on the opposite side of Sur creek to the Jenebeh and own about eight or ten dhows. According to Saiyid Mahomed bin Ahmed, Aiqa formerly belonged to the Hinawi. The Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin Majid occupied it under their patronage, but Abdullah bin Salim threw off the Hmawi connection and made the place purely a Bani Bu Ali settlement. The Bani Bu Ali are a wild and warlike tribe of ruffians. Thev put up a fight against a Division of Indian troops, and their name is to be found on the colours of a number of Indian regiments. The Sultans of Muscat have never been able to control them, but have often enlisted their assistance during former rebellions, when they have come chiefly for the sake of loot. II.—Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. -4 • T ^ e rp Bani Bu Ali tribe of Jaalai1 are a branch of the great Adnani tribe mm lemeem. Tf 1 !' Tlle f :Bani o Ali ?PP ears t0 be of rec ent origin, since in the tt w n pTT aDd I Se yy ids of Oman,' by Salil ibn Razik, translated by the Kev. G. P. Badger they are constantly being referred to as the Beni lemeem, and not as the Bani Bu Ah. 13. The Bani Temeem, one of the most considerable tribes in Arabia ascribe their origin to Temim—born about A.D. 120—the son of Murr a descendant of Mauhar through Tabikhah, and therefore of the race of Adn'an and Maadd. They were dispersed over the north-east of Neid from the bynan desert to the borders of the el Yamamah. Their territory comprised f'^'v- Sei V | , 1 a &gt;1 ria '. and extended on the south between the confines ot A1 Yamamah and el Bahrain. ^ ul 4 ' + The rp? ui Ali ^Mcounied the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. 1 hey belong to the Wahabi sect known as Azraqah and will not eat meat cooked by others. The founders of the Wahabi, Ibadhi, and lufuyyah sec s all belonged to the Beni Temeem, whilst the Harth, the other branch of the Bani lemeem in Oman have been the principal supporters of the Muttawa or extreme sect of the Ibadhis. w/nf Q 1 18 ? 7 f tbe y ah . abls sei l lt a Joasmee fleet of 22 dhows to attack the T at Sur, but met with _ such a spirited resistance on the part of the Jenebeh and Bam Bu Ah that they were driven off with heavy loss Intrigue accomplished what force failed to do.5 During the Wahabi invasion of 18.12-3, Salim bin AH, Temeemak Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali, became their bnpporter, helping them against the Bani Bu Hassan. In consequence of the part which Salim bin Ali had taken against the Bani Bu Hassan, there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a light wherein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed ; some of the Bani Bu Hassan also fell, and as neither side would give in, the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 16. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali as Temeemah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi, .throwing off the authority,of the Imam. 17. In 1820 Saiyid Said, having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that his followers among the A1 Ashkarah had plundered many English ships wrecked there, applied to the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. The Bani Bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports of piracy near Ras el Hadd. Captain Thompson, in charge of operations, decided^ to avenge the act, and with a small force consisting of six •companies, sailed to Muscat, where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani Bu All, the capital of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate, and after attempting to take the town, were sharply repulsed. Six out of eight officers and 270 men were killed. In January 1821 Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore British influence in the gulf. From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani Bu Ali, which surrendered after most of the defending force had been killed or captured. The Sheikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bombay. (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Vol. VI.)* 18. As late as 1815 the Bani Bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance of the Wahabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco, but they continue .to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer. ' (Lorimer Vol. II., p. OG.) ' 19. In 1854 Sultan Saiyid Said stated that the Bani Bu Ali had long withdrawn from allegiance to him. 20. In the early part of the reign of Saiyid Thoweynee [1856-66] the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other, in which Sheikh Abdulla bin 'Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ali, at the head of the Bani Bu Ali, generally won ihe day. About the same time a series of raids was committed by the Wahibah against the Bani Bu Ali, these raids culminating in a serious -engagement at Theeleyeh, in which Sheikh Abdulla greatly distinguished himself by totally defeating and routing the enemy.'I' _ 21. Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality, but -Saiyid Salim during his reign [1866-8], having had reason to suspect treachery on the part of the Hinawi garrison at Muscat, sent a large present to Sheikh Abdulla and requested his help to defend him in his position. Sheikh Abdulla gladly removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it, fbut, owing to the vacillatory policy of Saiyid Salim, was dismissed after a stay of four months and returned to JaaJan. Soon after this, Saiyid Azzan- bin-Khais, on coming to power in 1868, summoned him and^ the other Sheikhs of the Bani Bu Ali to Muscat to render their submission, and on their having refused to visit him, he marched against the Bani Bu Ali, seized three of the Sheikhs of the tribe and threw them into prison at Muscat. * A good description of these operations arid the subsequent proceedings is contained in the Annual Administration .Reports, 1883-4, page 26. f Abdulla bin Salim was not actually Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali till 1867, in which jear the Temeemah Mahomed bin Majid Avas murdered; but he certainly took a very jprominent part in affairs before that date.22, Concerning this expedition Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident in the Gulf, wrote at the time (No. 202, dated 3rd November 1809) : ' If Saiyid Azan bin Khais should succeed in his present expedition in the south, be would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could.' 23, Sheikh Abdulla, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutawwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani Bu Hassan and the A1 Wahibah to wage war against the Bani Bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh, in which Abdulla defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for this the Bani Bu Hassan rose again, only to be defeated a second time at ISeh A1 Masaddee. 24, In 1870, Saiyid Turki having requested the help of the Bani Bu Ali, they joined him at Sur, and 200 of their number marched under Sheikh Abdulla and Yusuf against Matrah, where they both took a leading place till Saiyj o „ services Saiyid Turki granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Aii exemption from the payment of customs on the goods imported by them into Sur, 25. In 1874 the Bani Bu Ali had at length amicably adjusted an internecine feud that had been going on amongst themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other, and as regards wounded (about 70 in number), the 'blood money was determined by Mahomedan Law, 26. In 1874 Bani Bu Ali of the Ja'afarah section, belonging to Lashkharah, were responsible for the wrongful confinement and subsequent release on ransom of subjects of the Rao of Cutch at Hellanujah Island. Major Miles went to Lashkharah in H.M.S. Philomel, and as the surrender of the actual offenders could not be obtained, a fine of $600 was imposed and readily paid at Sur by Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali acting on behalf of the Ja'afarah. 0 27. In 1881 the Bani Bu Ali attacked and defeated the Bani Bu Hassan m their own quarter of Jawabi al Khwarah. This engagement was described as the most sanguinary ever fought between Omani tribes, and is said to have cost 157 killed on both sides. 28. In 1887 the Awlad Kassib kidnapped one Bania at Sur and had severely beaten another. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of his own accord restored the kidnapped Bania and imprisoned five of the Awlad Ivassib.t 28 a . In 1888-9 relations between the Bani Bu Ali and Jenebeh were strained. In May 1889 hostilities broke out, which resulted in a fi s ht of some importance. Badr bin Saif, who went there to settle the dispute reported on return that the Bani bu Ali had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Hio-bness\ officials, and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in all local matters, 29. In 1895 the Bani Bu Ali sent a detachment in support of Saivid Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Saleh bin Ali, but they made no determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amim of the Bani Bu Ali an allowance of $100 per mensem. . 30. Li the spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafins and Bmawis of Sharqiyah being then in progress, Abdulla bin balim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordinglv marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdulla had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatam became so strained that when Major Cox (then I For full details vide ' Narrative of Muscat Affairs,' 1874-5 (sic), para. 348 t The Awlad Kassjb were originally a Fakhth of the Jenebeh W . protection of the Bani Bu Ali. TJle Jene, 3eli, but came under the-Political Agent, Muscat) arnvcd there in August he found the two factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately proceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and before proceedings had commenced in earnest the Sultan was called away by serious news from Rustaq ; nevertheless, his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbour hood. (Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 580.) 31. In 1913 Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim A1 Alawi died. He was considered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat,, and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him, -and as the latter's son Mahomed was still a.minor, Abdulla's second son Ali was made Amir jointly with Mahomed bin JNaser. An arrangement which still continues. 32. During the 1913-9 rebellion the Ban! Bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but their behaviour was not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice given them for their progress inland, to their homes :iit Sur and also left behind the ammunition, with which the Sultan had provided them, at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient •opportunity, and then on their arrival at Sib were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. They retreated unexpectedly- and unaccountably from Bidbid, where they were first established, to Watiyah. On being brought back to Muscat much alarm was felt owing to their reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. Their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly amongst themselves and paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Mahomed bin Naser, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be induced to obey orders of any kind. In one quarrel amongst themselves, which arose over pilfering by some of them in the bazaar whom the Sheikh wished to punish, stones and sticks were freely used, with the result that there were several heads broken. Even the Sheikh himself was stoned. 33. Since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert bis authority, relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change, fn 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani Bu Ali through misdirected economy, but Mr. Wingate 0 restored them. 34. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement, and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were 'unable to intervene on their behalf. This claim to independence on the part of the Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact entered into by the Wahabi Sheikh on his invasion •of Oman, when certain Sheikhs were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right without any dependence on Muscat (Bombay Government Records, XXIV, p. 43). 35. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde 0 that he was -authorised by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to •effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied, permitting him to interfere during the Salifah period, but after this period he was not to interfere in anything. 36. Major Hinde then enquired how it was that the Sheikh did not permit the new customs house to be built at Sur. Mahomed bin Naser became •evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and stating that he never would * Then Political Agent, Muscat.agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs at S'ur and Aiqa had never been recognised by his forbears, himself or his tribe. 37. In 1925 Colonel Prideaux (then Political Resident in the Gulfy remarked that the Amirs were not very lojal to the Snltan anci that if they had done their duty and given the Wali of Sur aU the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped b} 71 a Bedouin. 38. Tn December 1925, in protesting against having to obtain a 'No- Objection' certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay, Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Government of India : 'I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent State/ and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political Agent, Muscat. I hold the Political Agent in high regard, but I think you will appreciate that I prefer to preserve the dignity of my State not to do an act detrimental to its independent possession. 39. Mahomed bin Naser has as his lieutenants (1) Abdnlla bin Saleh, a Habshi, who was his agent in Bombay, speaks English and is reputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Nasers letter to the Government of India. He is stated to be very unreliable; (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about December 1927 lo teach his children. Reputed to know a little English and to be much travelled. III.—Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. 40. Little is traceable concerning the early history of this tribes According to Colonel Miles, they are a branch of the Bani Jabir and, therefore, Wilad Dhubyan of Kahtanate origin, but now classed as Ghafiri. They are considered the least religious tribe in Oman, and in this connection it would be interesting to trace whether there is any connection between them and Abu Said al Hassan, el Janaby, the Karmaty, who abolished prayer and fasting and the pilgrimage and attacked the Hajj and invaded Oman about the year A.D. 900.' :i: ' 41. A violent grudge of old standing between the Jenebeh and the Harth (the tribe of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh—the strong man of the Imam's Government), culminating in an affray near Khaburah in which the Jenebeh were the victors, is mentioned as taking place in the early part of the reign of Saiyid Said (1807-56), whilst they were assisting the latter in his opera tions against the Wahabis. Later they appear to have assisted the Wahabis in conjunction with Mahomed bin Nasir al Jabir against Saiyid Said. Later still they appear once more to have assisted Saiyid Said against the Wahabis. 42. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur, discontented wath the Sultan's rule, .sought Wahabi assistance from Baraimi ; and the Wahabi agent, nothing loth, sent a contingent, who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu traders and shopkeepers ; the extent of their losses was estimated at $27,700 and one of their number was killed and another wounded. Before beino- allowed to leave for Muscat, they were stripped of almost all their clothing.| 43. Colonel Pelly considered that a prompt and severe exatnple should be made of the Jenebeh, who were implicated with the Wahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment, of . this tribe. They had lono- been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti-slavery proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H.M.S. Wasp, who had disappeared from * They were in league with the Bani Jabir for many years, following their fortunes vis-a-vis the Wahabis. t For fuller details vide ' Muscat and its Relations with the Wahabi Power.'9 their craft a few months before. The Sultan of Muscat was assured of their criminality and had himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Pelly had also in the^ preceding month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the heads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of $27,000 as compensation for the property plundered by them from Briiish subjects and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand. Their reply was that on a former occasion when Lieut. Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast nothing was done, and they were quite sure the Resident would not come now. 44. On the Uth February 1866 H.M.S. Highflyer appeared off Sur to- insist on atonement by the Jenebeh for their part in the affairs of August, by payment of 127,700 compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate, a tire was opened which demolished their fort, the whole of their boats were either confiscated or burnt, and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. No personal injury was suffered by non-combatants, who had ample opportunity to move, but a small part of the town was burnt accidentally in consequence of a change in the- direction of the wind. 45. In the month of June 18/5 a godown belonging to the principal Indian tradei of Sui, a Bania named Jethnand Motamull, was broken into during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of Jenebeh, who- offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about $1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town and the robbeis made no^ attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrate with or suppress their tribesmen. There was no Wali or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the- time who could have taken action in the matter. The Bania therefore leported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His- Highness, who promised redress. 46. Soon after this, H.M.S. Jt ijieman happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offender, and would have doubtless caused restitution, but H.M.S. Rifle man, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed anchor, the Sheikhs perceived how matters, stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 47. During His Highness Saiyid Turki's absence in Gwadur, the case was presented to Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without beneficial result. About this time the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the Bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This, arrangement they afterwards repudiated. Saiyid Turki w r as reminded of the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs? 48. His Highness finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter m the hands of Government, and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported His Highness's request mat the enforcement of reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held His Highness personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh s hands would have tended still further to weaken His Highness's authority, and w-ould have encouraged the predatory Arabs to- contmue then- depredations on British subjects at His Highness's expense • whilst the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand' be a cautionary warning to all. Colonel W. F. Prideaux, the Political T.f ll ¥ G - tG . d that in addition to the original amount a fine of Jt)-,U00 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as compensation for the delay and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subiect 3393 .J49. At first, however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan's request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals was the duty of the Sultan, and that in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turki the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy and for other material aid which had been afforded to Saiyid Turki from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would be effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for armed intervention. 50. The Sultan's efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective that finally in July 1877 the Political Agent was authorised by Government to proceed to Sur in H.M.S. Teaser and convey the Sultan's demands. 51. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Ilighness's order and warned them that if they failed to comply within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognised head at the time, the nominal Sheikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readiness to comply with His Highness's order, but explained that the -absence of a recognised authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of reimbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting against the Bani Bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time -and were allowed until suuset on the 25th. 52. By noon of the 25th, Jethanand's claim amounting to $1,600 had been satisfied, partly by a money payment and partly by a buggalow (or native dhow), of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Sur and Jethanand came on board. The former delivered to the Political Agent $2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied. Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that the fine of $2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki, after deducting the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 53. In 1885 Saiyids Faisal and Fahd went to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh, but were unsuccessful. 54. In 1898 Suleiman bin Suweylim 5 who was the Sultan's Wali of Dhofar, Sur, and Sohar, went to Sur, where the inhabitants were beino' encouraged by French agency to make light of the Sultan's authority. He summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that in future he would not respect K ha fir and would seize the persons and propertv of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly, even if in the house of the u Khafir ' himself. (When a party or caravan wish to pass through the country of another tribe, they take with them as escort a man belongino- to the tribe through whose country they wish to pass. The partv or •caravan is then safe from attack, and this is known as the ' Khafir' system. It is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe travelling under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a -blood feud, are safe.) 55. This aroused the greatest indignation amongst the Jenebeh. Suleiman then proceeded to Muscat, leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years, in charo-e of the place. Later he wrote to his son at Sur, ordering him to build a fort .at a spot which would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. Such a fort would have enabled the Sultan to overcome the Jenebeh and ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Sur. About this time Suleiman's son threatened to shoot a gardener, and actually did shoot a bullock and cutII down a date tree belonging to. tlie gardener, because the latter refused to- supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own cainels. 56. The four sections of the Jenebeh then combined and wrote letters to the Sultan asking him to stop the building of the fort and remove Suleiman's son from Sur. The Sultan did not reply to these letters. Five of the Sheikhs theu came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear and they went away disappointed. 57. At length, after representations from several quarters, His Highness sent his writer Hamad to Sur to listen to the complaints of the Jenebeh and stop the building of the fort. No attention was paid by Suleiman's son to this order, and on Hamad's return His Highness did not even take the trouble to hear his report. 58. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali now intervened and induced the Sultan to stop the building of the fort, but the Jenebeh. insisted on the recall of Suleiman's son and said they were quite prepared to fight rather than submit to Suleiman's rule. 59. The Jenebeh then cut off the supplies of the garrison. The Sultan at once wrote to the Jenebeh warning them that their attitude, if persisted in, would only result in speedy and condign punishment. The Sultan's- messenger was informed by the Sheikhs that unless he left Sur before nightfall, his blood would be on his own head. 60. It was difficult to understand why the Sultan persisted in trying to- force Suleiman bin Suweylim's unpopular and high handed rule on the Jenebeh against their will. He had neither money nor troops with which to coerce the tribe. Any man he could raise would come out, not for the purpose of fighting, but merely to live at His Highness's expense ; whilst the- Jenebeh, though not a martial tribe, were well armed and had sufficient money to induce other tribes to join them. 61. At length, towards the end of September, a force consisting of 600 Jenebeh, 200 Bani Bu Ali and 150 Bani Rasib beleaguered the fort occupied by the Sultan's representative. The rebels opened fire at long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without resulting in any loss for either side, when it suddenly seemed to strike one of the Sheikhs that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, the rebels guaranteeing that the Wall's son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the coast and placed on board a vessel bound for Muscat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party despatched to Muscat. 62. Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built fort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offering to hand over the fort to anyone deputed by him except Suleiman bin Suweylim or his son, and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison under Hamad bin Saif. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheikhs, informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion, but the Sheikhs, not convinced of his bond fides, refused to allow Hamad to take over the fort'and he returned to Muscat. 63. At the end of the year the Jenebeh were persuaded to accept a new Wall, and Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad (the present Wali of Matrah and President of the Council) and a fresh garrison of 60 men took possession of the fort. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled ; all the woodwork had been removed and nothing left but the bare walls. 64. During this period the authority of the Sultan was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at Sur, published by the French Government in 1901, showed that their attention had been directed to that place at some earlier date, and in 1893 M. Chapui, a somewhat disreputable French subject, arrived at Sur in a steamer flyin^ the French flag and tried to obtain a site for a coal shed there.12 The scheme for advancing French interests by a wide distribution o French flag was boldly pursued. In November 1891 it was state - many as 50 Sur boats flying the French flag were bound for . Bu ^' e ' 18 had put in to Lingah. (This question is further dealt with in - re of the slave trade.) By 1900 the people of bur, especially those Jenobeh tribe, had almost ceased, under French encouragement, to regai ■Sultan as their master. • • i 65. In 1900 Hilal bin Amr arrived at Sur from East Africa, jomec hands with M. Ottavi, and began to inveigh against the Sultan and tne British; and the spirit of the Jenebeh was such that, when summoned by the Sultan to meet him at Muscat, they refused to go and insolently suggested that he should deal with them instead ^ through the rencii Vice-Consul, It was this state of affairs which obliged baiyid taisal in June 1900 to make a visit to Sur, the first siuce his accession m IbbS. Mis reception was more favourable than he had expected, for all the elders o± Uie town immediately paid their respects to him, the Cheif Sheikh of the-bam Bu Ali came down from the interior with a thousand men to do him honour, .and the Sultan was successful, before he left, in obtaining from the J^rencn flag holders of the port, including the Jenebeh, a formal profession ot allegiance to himself and a renunciation of French protection. (56. In 1901 the Sultan sent 80 Askaris to garrison his post at Sur, and the French flag holders, few of whom had observed their promise given m the previous year, understanding the act as a threat to themselves, asked M. Ottavi whether he would protect them in case of an attack by the Sultan s .troops; his reply was unfavourable, and the incident marked another stage in the decline of French influence at Sur. 67. About 1913 a blood feud started between the Arama and Makhana -sections of the Jenebeh, which has continued ever since. In 1918 His Highness the Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Rs. 14,000 and imprisoned 20 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years. 68. In 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganised and the people of Sur, seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced, refused to allow^ customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain MacCollum, the then Wazir, went to Sur in H.M S, Britomart, and the Jenebeh agreed to accept the new arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since. The customs house was not built,'difficulties being invariably placed in the way, and the Wali became as powerless and inept as ever. 69. Spasmodic murdering went on, and in 1923 the Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to attempt to put an end to the feuds. He returned, having been openly flouted and having accomplished nothing. In July Zubair, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban, LA. (in command of the Muscat Levies) and 150 levies and three machine guns, proceeded to Sur and occupied the fort. Zubair reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered $6,400 customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe $4,000. A site was selected for a custom house -and the party returned to Muscat in triumph. Unfortunately there was one ^ase in which blood money was not accepted. The Makhana agreed to pardon the murderer, an Arama. He was imprisoned in Muscat and was released in 1924. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered Sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections, in which one Arama boy was killed. The Fuwaris took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama, and a struggle ensued, in which an Arama girl was killed. The Wali was able to use the Ramzan feast for arranging a 45 days' armistice. 70. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Kaser, Amir of the BaniBuAli, .started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser, Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhana and A1 Ghialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud among the Jenebeh—to acknowledge his authority.71. In 1925 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser, of Masirah Island, proceeded to bnr and intormed the Hindu oommnnitv that there was no Sultan's Government m Sur, and that they were to look to him for justice He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of iustice -as the local Wall had been found incapable. The Wali told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. T4 'T Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah, accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salun bm Naser, brothers of Mahomed bin Naser of the Bam Bu Ah, stayed at Mecca for three months as the quests of His Majesty Ibn baud. Mansur bin Naser died of smallpox on the return journey. IY.—The Slave Trade at Sur. • i 7 o 3 ;o? ntisl1 efforts fo ^ the suppression of the slave trade first took shape in 1822 by a treaty concluded with Saiyid Said of Muscat, the object being the extinction of the slave trade between Africa and India. This treaty was amphfied in 1838-9. Another agreement was made in 1845 Ao-ain m Ib/^ a Aew treaty was made. 74. The Resident in the Gulf, writing in 1844, says, 'Muscat and Sur .are he principal primary ports to which slaves from wheneesoever shipped whether from Zanzibar or the Red Sea, are brought.' In the'sixties the 1 olitical Agent m Muscat estimated that about. 4,000 out of 15,000 slaves port'ofSu^ Were Ianded e ' ther at Ras el Ha(W or the adjacent 70. In 1852 the steam vessel Tigris was placed on special duty at the -entrance to the Gulf, but it soon becaiue evident that surveillance would be more eitective if instituted on the African coast. tr Jo m Seventies somewhat greater success attended the efforts of 11. M.S. Magpie and Vulture, sent to cruise off Ras el Hadd. The latter -captured a large dhow, in which were 169 slaves, mostly women and childien. The Nakhoda of the vessel was imprisoned by the Sultan of Muscat, and the vessel destroyed From a description in the (October 1872) of a slave vessel captured by the the methods of the exporters appear to have been characterised by great barbarity ' The number of slaves it was impossible at the time to estimate ; so crowded on deck and in the hold oelow was the dhow, that it seemed, but for the aspect of misery, a very nest of ants. The hold, from which an intolerable stench proceeded was several inches deep in the most foul bilge water and refuse. Down below, there were numbers of children in the most loathsome stages of smallpox and scrofula of every description. A more disgusting a t .i? 6 ^ spectacle of hum imty could not be seen, while the foulness of the dhow was such that the sailors could hardly endure it. When thp slaves were transferred to the Vulture the poor wretched creatures were so dieadfnlly emaciated and weak that many had to be carried on board and lifted for every movement. How it was that so many survived such hardships was a wonder to all. . . . But perhaps the most atrocious piece -of cruelty of the Arabs was heard afterwards from the slaves themselves viz., that at he first discovery of smallpox among them by the Arabs all the affected slaves were at once thrown overboard, and this was continued day by day until, they said, 40 had perished in this manner.' 77. In 1873 HM.S. London was stationed at Zanzibar for 10 years and .luring that period the who esaie traffic was for the time being suppressed But slaves still arrived m the Persian Gulf in small lots and dealers had begun to conceal their operations by use of the French Hag, which secured them against search by British vessels. In the 'eighties there was a Zanzibar enCe 0WlnS t0 tlie withdrawal of H.M.S. from t „ In&lt; J' i 'T showed that slaves^were brought to Sur in vessels beloneinc to that port, most of which flew French colours. The slaves were •oidinanly landed at Sur itself but the owners of the vesselshnd i* .t Ras el Hadd and other places, and when British c^app^ZT^received warning and landed them at small places near by, whence the slaves were marched in gangs to Sur, The demand in the interior behind Sur is not great, for the system of irrigation in Jaalan and Sharkiyah aoes not demand slave labour. The majority of the slaves are re-exported in small vessels to the Batineh, where irrigation is mostly from wells, and where some of them are retained. The balance is distributed from the Batineh to the Trucial coast by land. At this lime the number imported here annually was estimated at 300. The Jenebeh tribe proclaimed openly that their only object in taking the French flag was to protect their slaving operations. 79. Sur quickly attained a disreputable prominence in the traffic, and it became increasing!} 7 clear that the only way to put an end to it was to break up the Sur depot; but the chief obstacle to such a step was the attitude of France in regard to her flag. Political difficulties arose owing to the extent to which the protection of the French flag was being abused. 80. From 1892 onwards abundant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of the French flag by importers. In 1896 several vessels carrying slaves were captured. In May the Political Agent captured a vessel carrying 28 slaves. A few days later H.M.S. Lwptoing captured a vessel carrying 14 slaves, whilst the Sultan's officials rescued two recently imported slaves at Bunder Gisseh. H.M.S. Sphinx captured two vessels flying the French flag. The one had 30 slaves on board ; the other 140. A third vessel, whose French papers appeared to be in order, was allowed to proceed. The vessels, though stated in the papers to belong to Madagascar and Comoro, were in reality from Sur. 81. Owing to political difficulties created by these seizures, slave cruising was virtually discontinued and from this time onwards the traffic appears to have been on the increase. The Sultan was assured by the Government of India that his subjects could not be removed from his jurisdiction, but the precariousness of his position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking any action. 82. In 1900 Captain P. Z. Cox, then Political Agent, Muscat, re-examined the question of the importation of slaves. He found that about 1,000 slaves had been imported that year into Sur, of which about half had been carried in vessels under the French flag. In 1901 about 1,000 slaves were again imported, whilst in 1902 the supply was stated to be abundant. In 1902,. 114 Arabs were captured by the Portuguese in Mozambique whilst actually engaged in slave trading. About a third of them died in confinement, while of the remainder 54 were sentenced to transportation for 25 years. With a few exceptions these men belonged to the Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali tribes of Sur. The number of the captives who might have claimed French protection was never ascertained, but it was admitted by one of them before the Portuguese authorities that two of the vessels captured flew the French flag. 83. In ] 905 the award of the Hague tribunal in regard to the French flag question compelled the French authorities to exercise a closer supervision over native masters entitled to use the French colours. 84. Since the settlement of the French flag question and the stoppage of the principal sources of supply at Zanzibar and on the African coast very little attention appears to have been paid to the traffic of slaves at Sur, but I am assured from several sources that the trade, both in slaves and in arms, is very profitable and nearly every Arab dhow arriving at Sur has a small quantity of these commodities. The slaves are being imported from Socotra Mokalla and Dhofar* whilst the arms come from Jeddah and the Italian ports in the Red Sea. Y,—Summary of recent Events in Sur. 85. In 1927 the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh each built three new forts in their quarters against the orders of the Wali. 86. In August 1927 Mr. Thomas, Minister of Finance, Went to Sur. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh tb pay 2^ lakhs 6f rupees which they owe15 Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Muscat, and to pull d down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the -opposition to this came painly from the Arama section, and on leaving iSur, in v , | the Al Saeed, he took in tow an Arama sambuk, which was in the harbour, whereupon the Arama fired on the Al Saeed. Beyond hitting the funnel .and one of the ship's boats, no damage was done. The fire was not returned. ^ The Council firi^d the Arama section lis. 10,000, but have been unable to J enforce this. &amp; ^ I' 11 April 1028 the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali established a new g Hf customs post at Aiqa. Their Customs officer wrote to the State Customs ' Ofiicial at Sur, demanding refund of customs which the State had levied ^ | on the grounds that the boat belonged to the Bani Bu Ali. The Amirs ) refused to furnish the Council's representatives with any explanation regarding this customs post. 88. About the same time the Bani Bu Ali stopped a boat belonging to the Arama section from entering the creek, whereupon the Arama prevented a Bani Bu Ali boat from entering the creek. The Bani Bu Ali then occupied Balad As Sur with a view to commanding the water supply of Sur and obtaining mastery over the town. On the 15th April they were attacked in Balad As Sur by about 70 men of the Arama and Fuwaris under the leadership of Sheikh Yaser al Majaala. The Arama lost six killed, whilst the Bani Bu Ali lost 10 killed and three wounded. Sheikh Hashid, Minister lor .Religious Affairs, accompanied by Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness, went to Sur on the 17th April to try and i V settle the dispute. Their reception by the Amirs was not cordial, and they returned to Muscat on the -.'ircl April, having failed to accomplish anything. However, through the intervention of other Sheikhs, the parties came to teims. Ihe Arama and Makhana sections each destroyed one of their forts. All sections of the Jenebeh were to pay $20 on each of their boats to the Amirs for this year only, and Sheikhs Yaser and Naser bin Mubarak were to call on the Amirs at Aiqa. 89. On the 25th May the Amirs wrote to the Council of Ministers, stating that their action had been taken on behalf of the Muscat State and demanding payment of $10,000 expenses. They attempted to send this letter to the Council through the Political Agent, but it was returned to them and they were informed that it' they wished to communicate with the Council they should do so direct. 90. In May Abdulla bin Saleh, Secretary to Mahomed bin Naser proceeded to Bushire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bani Bu Ali did not recognise the Sultan's authority and attempted to get a certificate of identity at the Agency. He was directed to obtain a passport from the Sultan's Government. 91. In July 1928 His Highness the Sultan and the Council of Ministers furnished their views on the situation at Sur. They resented the letters and Iil O actions of the Amirs of Jaalan, realised they were not strong enough to deal with the situation and asked for the assistance of the British Government. 92. In August 1928 the Amirs wrote to the Political Resident claiming that bur was a part of their territory, that the Sultan's \\ ali was there and customs collected with their permission, that the town and customs were under their protection and everything would be accomplished in its proper time. ' 1 93. On the 21st August a party of about 15 Arabs, chiefly of the Fuwaris section^ of the Jenebeh, boarded a Cutch Mandvi buggalow belonoinc to a British subject, Khimji Ram das, which had arrived from Karachi overawed the crew with rifles and daggers, and made off with 22 bags of rice and Rs. 200 worth of personal property belonging to the Nakhoda. Most of the culprits are known. The Council of Ministers arrested one of them m Muscat and are attempting to obtain the surrender of the others from the Fuwaris Sheikhs. 11 94 ' ft 11 tlie ni 8' llt of the 27th August some Arabs climbed over a broken wall and got into the fort where the Wali lives. They stabbed his two best16 horses. The Wall's Askaris are believed to have had a hand in it in conjunction with the Bani Bn Ali. They have been replaced b3^ others from Muscat. The Wali's telephone line from his residence to the customs is also being cut constantly. 94 a . About this time a party of the Meshaikh tribe (a small tribe of Bedouins and robbers, originally allied to the Beni Bu Hassan, but now stated to be under the protection cf the Bani Bu Ali) stationed themselves on the road outside Muqrimatain and looted all people coming into Sur for some days. They killed a number of donkeys. 95. On the 18th September a shop belonging to a British subject— Motimul Sukkumul—-was broken into at noon by two men, an Arab and a slave, whilst the owner was upstairs. The robbers ran away on seeing the owner coming down, taking with them $138 in cash and ornaments wOrth $95 ; whilst running away they dropped $45 worth of ornaments, which were recovered. 96. Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani Bu Ali removed the flagstaff from his house at Aiqa and erected a new flagstaff on ground level. On the 21st September Abdulla bin Saleh, mentioned above, hoisted Ibn Sand's flag on the newly erected flagstaff. A salute of three guns was fired when the flag was hoisted and one gun when it was lowered in the evening. This appears to be a parallel to the action of Saiyid Fadhl bin Alawi Moplah at Dhofar in 1875, when the latter styled himself as Governor of Dhofar under the Ottoman Porte (see Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 591). 97. On the 21st September a caravan from Budiyah (Imam's territory), which had brought dry dates for Khimji Ramdas and obtained advances for a further supply, was returning to Budiyah laden with rice. It was seized by a party of Fuwaris under one Said bin Abdulla, who was the leader of the party who looted Khimji Ramdas's boat on the 21st August. Naser bin Ali, Khimji Ramdas's landlord, succeeded in intercepting them before they had reached Jebel El Eed and recovered the caravan without loss. Said went to the Wali and threatened him that if the Council did not release the man whom they had arrested at Muscat in connection with the looting of the buggalow, he would commit further mischief. 98. On the 26th September Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Wali of Sur not to allow caravans to come to Sur from Budiyah with dates. The Wali refused to comply. He also wrote to the Political Agent stating that his truce with the Hijriyin had been broken and asking him to warn British subjects not to deal with the Hijriyin of Budiyah. He was asked not to interfere with the legitimate trade of British subjects. It would seem from the above that the gang of Fuwaris were acting in conjunction with Mahomed bin Naser in stopping the Budiyah caravan. 99. It is believed that this action of the Amir is in order to induce caravans to proceed to his new customs at Aiqa instead of Muqrimatain. He has also attempted to induce British merchants to transfer themselves to Aiqa, offering to charge 2| per cent, instead of 5 per cent, as charged by the Muscat authorities. 100. There has been trouble also with regard to a Chinaman who went to Sur via Aden and Muscat. He bought a large quantity of fish and fins and refused to pay the export duty on the grounds that he had already paid it to the Amirs. On the 16th September Abdulla bin Saleh wrote to the customs Mudir, stating that the Chinaman was under the protection of the Amirs, that his goods should be shipped to any place he desires, and that the Government had no right to recover any duty in any places under the rule of the Amirs. 101. On the 30th September the Director of Customs at Muscat received mrormatiou from our that the Amirs had ordered their man in charge of customs at Aiqa to count the sailing vessels entering Jerama and Sur creeks as they intended to charge anchorage fee. They intended also to register boats at Aiqa in the name of the Amirs. s The levy of such dues at Khor Jerama would appear to be a revival of the dispute m 18/.-80. when the people of Ras el Hadd attempted to levy17 \ I t) such dues and the British authorities were obliged to take cognisance of the matter. British war vessels visited the spot in 1877, 1879 and 1880. All tolls on trading vessels entering the Khor were then finally abolished. (Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 515 ; also Narrative of Muscat Affairs.) 102. The latest news from Sur is that the caravan mentioned above left Sur for Budiyah on the 29th September accompanied as far as Qalab Kay eh by an escort of Fuwaris and Wali's askaris. Beyond Qalab Rayeh it was seized by a party of Bani Bu Ali, assisted by Ghialin and Makhana, and taken to Aiqa. The Wali sent a letter to the Amirs protesting against this,, but they have refused to restore the caravan. YI.—Review of the Situation at Sur. 103. Hitherto the policy pursued with regard to the slave trade, arms- traffic and ill-treatment of British subjects at Sur may be summarised in the words of Major (now Sir) P. Z. Cox in his Report No. 373, dated 29th August 1902 ' It must be conceded that the pi-esent Sultan has been in a great measure powerless to do much to stop the ingress of newly captured negroes, and at any rate during the time that the question of the French flag has- been in process of negotiation between His Highness and the French Government it would have been ill-advised on our part to put upon him any special pressure in this connection; but I venture to submit that the- ^ v recent purchase of a steamer for him and the fact that the question of the French flag seems to be shaping to a settlement, affords a convenient and fitting opportunity for the address to His Highness of a strong exhortation on the subject of Sur and its connection with the trade in arms and slaves- and as to his own position in regard thereto.' 104. The purchase of a small patrol steamer in 1926 has, proved no more effective as regards Sur than it did in 1902, whilst the total armed force of the Muscat Infantry which could be made available for despatch to Sur is- about 70 men. Such a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. 105. Both the Sultan and the Council of Ministers realise that they are not strong enough to deal with the situation without the support and assistance of the British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance the little control which the Muscat authorities exercise over Sur M will cease. They have definitely asked for such assistance. The prestige of the Muscat Government rests at present on the support which they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the State is impotent. If assistance were withheld the result would be far- reaching, as every part of the country would be affected. 106. A number of. Arabs in Oman are of opinion that the British Government are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they would countenance the formation of another independent authority in Jaalan. This, I have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Jaalan. Considered politically and in its bearings on the welfare of the Muscat State and the general peace of Oman, it seems most undesirable that any such claim should be countenanced. The Amirs could not maintain their independence, and the almost inevitable result of such a claim being allowed wpuld tend to foster the intrigues for extraneous support which the Amirs are now active in fomenting. 107. Whether Mahomed bin Naser has the approval of Ibn Sand for hoisting his flag at Aiqa seems doubtful, but the extension of Ibn Sand's influence to this part of the coast would seem to be undesirable.^ * In 1865 His Excellency the Governor of Bombay pointed out the evil effect of the revival of Wahabi power on the Indian Ocean with regard to piracy and slave tradino- and that these aggressions threatened seriously to injure Muscat, a power which for several generations past has been the only representative of civilisation and order in Eastern Arabia He proposed that aid be afforded to the Sultan to re-establish his authority in Sur or any other place on the seaboard of which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabis mav have dpnnV Jl him. (Minute dated 9ch October 1865.) - ^ ue P rivecl 3393 ^i •5 108. The value of Sur Xrom the point of view of prestige appears to have been realised by Colonel Pelly, who wrote in 1869 that if Saiyid Azzan bin Khais were successful in his expedition in Jaalan, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could. 109. It was also realised by the French, who confined all their efforts to undermine the Sultan's authority to that place. 110. The extension of the influence of the Amirs of Jaalan has also ■caused some uneasiness to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam's Government. Ihe Council fear that the Imam's Government may interfere and obtain mastery over Sur, in which case most of the trade from the interior would be deviated to Sur, and the revenues and trade of Muscat would become negligible.^ 111. In 1895 the British Government extended to Saiyid Faisal the guarantee given to his lather that they would not allow attacks to be made upon Muscat and Matrah, whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes. In actual practice this guarantee was extended to all the ports of the Batineh coast, and to Kuryat, at which British subjects were residing, and. in 1696 an offer was made by the British Government and finally accepted by the Sultan, of naval assistance for the recovery of Dhofar. 112. If assistance is now to be afforded, the question arises as to what form such assistance shall take, and I venture to put forward the following remarks on the question. 113. It seems hardly likely that at the stage which has now been reached, Mahomed bin Tvaser would be deviated from his purpose by moral pressure alone. His attitude will probably be that of the Jenebeh in 1865 : ' We have been threatened before. Nothing has happened. We are quite sure nothing will happen now.' 114. It was suggested last year that economic pressure could be brought on the inhabitants of Sur by preventing their dhows from trading in British ports. This was the policy attempted by Napoleon against England. It failed then. I doubt whether it would succeed in the present instance. 115. Naval action has been taken at Sur before, as has been noted in the Historical Summary of the Jenebeh, The presence of a man-of-war would appear to have a good moral effect at the time, but its influence seems to ■depart as soon as it has steamed out of sight and the incident forgotten as rapidly as the promises made to former Sultans on th'eir visits there. Beyond levying a few fines and possibly destroying a certain amount of property, the result obtained is meagre. It tends to make British merchants at Sur more unpopular than ever with their customers and force's them eventually to seek their means of livelihood elsewhere.'}' 116. If the administration of Sur is to be brought to that state of efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium demands, if the slave trade and arms traffic are to be stopped, and if effective protection is to be afforded to British subjects trading in Sur instead of allowing them to be * In 1891-2 caravan roads from Sharkiyali to Muscat were closed by Ghafm tribes and trade was deviated from tliat part of the province to Sur, thereby causing a p-loomv orosrwf for Muscat ti-ade. (Administration Report, 1891-2.)

The towns have been transformed from armed camps living constantly under the threat of raids, into peaceful and law abiding places as quiet and safe as any town in India. The result has been reached by gradual development of circumstances. Indian troops were landed in 1913, during the rebellion of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam of Tanuf, for the protection of Muscat and Matrah in accordance with our undertaking to defend these towns. After one attack in 1915, when he sustained a severe defeat. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh left these places severely alone. After the Sultan had come to terms with the Imam, a small levy corps under a British officer was formed and paid for by the Muscat Government, and the Indian troops were able to depart. 117. This corps, though very weak numerically, is a constant reminder to the tribes tlmtthey cannot raid the place with impunity and their presence is sufficient to restrain any lawless elements there may be in the population. 118. By stationing a battalion of Indian infantry at Sur for a year or two, the same result could presumably be achieved. The State could undertake to build a proper customs house and establish an effective administration there. Increased customs revenues could be utilised for the increase of the strength of the Muscat infantry by 100 men, eventually to take the place of the Indian troops as soon as the situation •becomes sufficiently stabilised. 119. The cost of such a force has been worked out for me in detail by •Captain Walker, Commandant, Muscat Infantry, but I have not thought it necessary to include such details in this report. He estimates initial ■expenditure, exclusive of quarters, at Rs. 21,170 ; annual expenditure for the first two years, Rs. 60,000 per annum ; annual expenditure subsequently, Rs. 61,400 per annum. 120. The customs receipts of Sur amounted to— 1924 - 37,457 The above amounts were collected under the conditions described above. If the town were properly under control the customs receipts should ^exceed one lakh. 121. With the presence of such troops, it might also be possible to induce the British India Company to send their slow mail, steamers to call at Sur. Although the volume of trade would justify this, the opposition of dhow -owners and the general insecurity of the place prevents their doing so at present. Such visits would be a'great civilising influence to the place in •addition to furnishing an easy means of access and also furthering British trade. Rs.

Early History of Sur. The name Sur is stated by Colonel Miles to be identical with that of Tyre or Sur in the Mediterranean and to have been its prototype. He therefore ascribes a Phoenician origin to the place. The Mart of Maceta (mentioned by Arrian in his account of the voyage of Nearclms), Hereen says, was probably Sur, and he adds that an emporium like this, at the entrance of the Gulf, strengthens our idea of an ancient Indian trade with the Oman coast. At the time of Albuquerque, Sur is described as a small fishing village he passed whilst approaching Muscat. The Portuguese appear to have occupied the place twice, the first period prior to 1633, when they were driven out by Naser bin Murshid al Yarraby, again prior to 1648, when one of the conditions imposed by the Arabs on the Portuguese was that the- fort of Sur should be surrendered and razed. APPENDIX 2. 'Wrecks and Piracy. In 1829 the Bani Bu Ali looted a British ship Oscar, which ran ashore on the coast of Jaalan, and plundered cargo to the value of eight lakhs of rupees. The Resident went to Sur, accompanied by 11.H. the Sultan, two frigates and a squadron, to recover the property, but succeeded in recovering $12,000 and some shawls only. It was remarked at die time : ' Finding that this Chief and tribe, in consequence of their residing in the interior, were wholly untangible by naval means alone, the British authority conceived it useless to attempt force and therefore endeavoured to create such an impression on the minds of the inhabitants of this dangerous coast as would be likely to prove highly beneficial to any British ship that might have the misfortune to suffer a similar accident.' (Vide Bombay Government Selections, XXIV, page 199.) In 1833 a piracy attended with cruel and aggravated circumstances, committed on a Cutch Nowry off the coast of Zanzibar, was traced by the Imam to some of the tribes of Sur. He seized the principal offenders and placed them at the disposal of the Resident to be dealt with as he might direct. In 1852 the S.S. Centaur ran ashore near Ras el Hadd. The Bani Bu Ali plundered the whole of her cargo, valued at 10 or 11 lakhs, and destroyed the vessel. In 1904 Jenebeh, of Masirah Island, were responsible for the murder of 17 of the crew of the Baron Inverclyde, which struck a rock near the Kuria Muria Islands. Eight Greeks remained on the ship and were rescued by the S.S. Prome. One ship's boat was never heard of again. The other boat contained the 17 men mentioned above, who were massacred on attempting to land at Masirah. The ringleaders were shot after trial by the Sultan's Askaris in the presence of Major Grey, Saiyid Taimur and a party from H.M.S. Merlin.35/134.

Our min object is to loaclise matters so as to avoid any stirring of Akhwan feelings in Hejd through the necessity of their coming to the rescure of fellow Wahabis. Muscat Govt are, however, incapable of taking the action demanded by the Govt of the Imam, If matters are left by us and conflagration arises in which Wahabi forces are defeated we are in danger of a Wahabi invasion from Hasa with results along the whole-3- Trueaial Goast which we should have to protect and also Sur passes into the hands of the Imata's Govt: if they are not defeated we kave a Wahalsi Govt established at Sur w Either Qf these possibilities we eannot face, and in either ease we should have to retake Sur by blockade and establish ourselves there with troops» Thus our object is to localise nature of disturbance.

(C onel.), dated the 25 th O ctober 1928. In connection with my telegrams Nos. 1009 (Serial No. 4) and T.-35 (Serial No. 10), dated the 16th and 23rd October 1928, I have the honour to invite a reference to my despatch No. 167-S., dated 20th April last (Serial No 1), on the subj'ct of the Amirs of Jaalan and the customs houses which they had set up in Sur. In this despatch I also reported that fighting hid broken out at Sur, On the 7th May the Political Agent, Muscat, reported that peace had been made. 2. While at Muscat I requested Major Murphy to draw up a report on the whole Sur question and I attach herewith a copy of his despatch No. C.-71, dated 28th April 1928. I forward a copy of this excellent despatch in full for, though it is loDg, the details given are required to understand the present situation. 3. As stated in my despatch No. 167-S. (Serial No. 1), it was impossible to deal with the matter satisfactorily, except in the presence of the Sultan of Muscat, and my only effort has been to tide over the summer until his return. Thus on the arrival of an emissary from the Amirs of Jaalan in June, I informed him that the Hesident would come to Sur this win ter to discuss and settle all differences and disputes, In the meantime I asked the Political Agent to obtain from the Council their opinion of the results of the action of the Amirs of Jaalan on the Muscat Government. It was difficult to get the Council to undertake this responsibility until ordered to do so by the Sultan, but the Political Agent was finally able to get a letter not only from the Council but from the Sultan also {vide Political Agent's No. K.-28, dated 17th July 1928). 4. The outlines of the general situation are simple. The really import' ant issues to us are certain statements in the letters of the Sultan and the Council. Sur has always been a difficult question for the Sultans of Muscat. It s turbulent tribes®have, however, always acknowledged Muscat sovereignty and by a balance of power and their enmity to the tribes of the interior the Sultan has always been able to draw upon one or the other of them to assist him on payment in time of trouble, and it was the Bani Bu Ali who, in 1895, came to Paisal bin Turki's assistance when the town of Muscat was occupied by the tribes of the interior. Indeed it has been the Jenebeh, the enemies of the Bani Bu Ali, who have been in general opposed to the Sultan 5. The main points for note in the present situation arise out of the rivalry of these two tribes, the Bu Ali and the Jenebeh. The former are a single political entity acknowledging as their most important Shaikhs the Amirs of Jaalan; the latter are composed of four sections at Sur, namely, the Makhannah, Ghialin, Puwaris and Aramah. The Makhannah and the Aramah, the two main sections, have had a blood feud since 1913. The Ghialin and the Fuwaris are comparatively unimportant, but the former have joined with the Makhannah and the latter with the Aramah. The Amirs of Jaalan in their bid for independence and the control of Sur and its hinterland have succeeded in winning over the Makhannah and the Ghialin. Thus the Aramah and the Puwaris are isolated and the Jenebeh as a tribe fail to produce the balance of power which has hitherto made it possible for the Sultan's weak Government to rule. 6. Sur is built on the two sides of an inlet of the sea with a channel to the ocean.i \ I I The Bu Ali live on one side and the Jenebeh on the other, while the Sultan Wall's fort is a few miles in the interior, where the water supply exists. 7. The rival sections of the Jeneheh have built forts facing each other, and this question has caused considerable fighting between the two parties of the same tribe, a matter which drew me to Sur a year ago. The joining of the Makhfmnah and the Ghialin with the Bu Ali will give the latter a footing on the Jenebeh side of the town apart from giving them a considerable preponderance in numbers. 8. In August 1927 Mr Thomas, the Wazir, went down to Sur. His official objects were to recover a sum of 2% lakhs of rupe s due to Khan Bahadur Nasib, the naval coal contractor and an important merchant of Muscat, and to induce the tribes to demolish the forts, which were making for fighting and bloodshed. He came to the conclusion that the Aramah section were responsible for the opposition to a settlement and accordingly to punish them forfeited a dhow of their section and proceeded to tow it away. The Aramah then opened fire on the Muscat Government ship, the ' A1 Saeed ', though they did not succeed m hitting it. Por this act against the Government they were fined rupees 10,000, a sum which the Muscat Government have been totally unable to recover since they have no force at their disposal. 9. Thus the Aramah were up to this point the villains of the play. But with the new claim of the Amirs of Jaalan to independence and t 0 the control of Sur the Aramah, with their allies the Euwaris, are the only persons in that place who acknowledge Muscat sovereignty. At this point a parenthes:'s is required. Mr. Thomas, the Wazir of Muscat, has always been desirous of keeping the Amirs of Jaalan friendly to the Sultan since he considered that without the Amirs' support the Sultan could not control Sur. Thus (as it would appear from subsequent events without the knowledge of the Sultan or the Council) he wrote a letter ol which the Amir has produced a copy, asking him to assist in recovering 'the fine from the Aramah. The Amirs are using this letter as an excuse for having originally come into Sur. ci ^ 10 ' iFir 6 J ^ mirs J aa l ail 5 ia reward for services to Saiyid Toorki Sultan of Muscat, were given in 1870 the personal right of freedom from customs dues. They have used this purely personal right as an objection to havin' a customs house of the Sultan's at Sur in the past, but they have now introducer! their own customs office at Aiqah, which is on the Bu Aii side of the inlet of . n - ^ ^estion then arises what action is the Muscat Government going to take to establish their position. It may be noted that the Politfcal Agent says that the utmost reinforcement the State can send for Sur would be about 70 men while the tribes possess several thousands of men. For an answer to the question I put, I would request a reference to the Sultan s letter and that of the Council on the result of the action of the Amirs of Jaalan if permitted to continue unchecked. ■Amns 12.

I am of opinion that unless the State receives some support to enable them to withstand the aggression of the Amirs, their authority will diminish not only in Jaalan but also in other parts of their territories.' 13. With Major Murphy's views it is impossible to quarrel.

The reply appears to 'be definitely in the negative.

They have undermined Walis authority thereby letting loose lawless element who are responsible for other acts.

Please compare above with your ietter to them dated gist Octr. They have protested to me against my warning issued in accordance with your telegram of 24th Octr. stating it is unusual for Government to issue such when British subjects are safe. They are accustomed to visits from men-of-war and convinced that we will not take action unless British subjects threatened. Visit from H.M's ship Kffingham wi thout taking action would hardly remove this conviction but may lead Hinawis to believe that we do not mean business thereby precipitating matters bombardment of fort occupieti fey gang who looted British dhow would also not alter this conviction. Gang would vacate fort when man of war appear d and reocoupy it on her departure in the case of its destruction they can occupy another fort.

It seems evident that unless there is to be dir-» -ect interference in the matter, the port of Sur will eventually pass out of the hands of the Sultan of Muscat. The effect of this on the Muscat State would be not only to deprive it of a source of potential revenue but also of a large portion of actual revenue, as much of the goods which now pay duty at Muscat would be deviated to iiur. 4.

They are not strong enough or influential enough amongst other tribes, to form an independ- ~ent State without considerable extraneous su^port^and,i think are sufficiently intelligent to realise this fact. Their hoist- ~ing of n #n Saud r s flag^a fact likely to 'fee resented 'fey many tribes,shows that they are now counting on such support e n#n Saud is too far away to afford any immediate or material assist -ance except perhaps in the supply of arms from JeddaJtuSuch a supply is actually coming into Sur though I have 'been unable 6© far to ascertain its extent or whether it is 'feeing sent in by Ibn Saud himself. The Amirs must realize that they cannot count on any direct assistance from that quarter and it seems to me the sup- -port which they are confidently looking forward to must come from other parts of Oman itself»! think that Isa bin Saleh also realizes this and that his fear of an immediate attack by ibn Saud■ Ihb net as reaX as it seeas® The rest ©f Oman outside Jaalan lias latterly lieen particularly qutet Tiut the situation Is not wit&amp;- *«eut signs of a coming storm.

I8a*s rebellion was successful because he was clerer enough ti^t^ceire the wisdom of bringlnc in the (ihafiris first and joining the moyement himself later# Ills relations with these Ghaflri tribes must however be rery precarious^ A letter to me frem the Amir dated 19th October 192d but which I hare only seen after return to Muscat t malces the sltua- «tion more clear* he states 'if the lilnawi tribes make any more** -mentfthe (xhafiri tribes are ready to render help according to the intimation which has been receiTed from the inhabitants of Qharbiah Tlzs Banl Riyaa, Daru and others. T&lt; It is olear from this letter that he expects that in the event of his being attacked by Sheikh isa bin Saleh and the hinawi tribes,the jSani Riyam and other Ghafiri tribes will attack Isa bxn Saleh from the rear. The directxnc brax* behind this movement has not as yet made Its appearance but I would draw your attention to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh*s postscript to his letter to the Council of minis* -tors dated ita October 1926 forwarded with my no. 120 dated 16th October in which he says n As you know Salyid Ahmad went to hejd with a view to ins- **tigate jrunc Ibn Baud® we are afraid tnat his going there might lead to some disturbances**.

Sir, I hare the honour to suhmit for your consid eration, the following report on the general situation in Oman. This country is occupied by numerous tribes both settled and nomad. For the sake of protection a- gainst their neighbours, with ? T hom they are constantly having blood feuds, the weaker tribes become allied to stronger tribes and this method of alliance has resulted in the formation of two political factions: Hina^i and Ghafiri, so called after two tribes, Bani Hina and Bani Ghafir, who at one time possessed very powerful sheikhs to whom the other tribes became allied. The racial tie bginc a strong one, the Hinawi faction is composed large ly though not essentially of Yeineni tribes whilst in the same ^ay,. the majority of Ghafiri tribes are of Adnani orijin. Most of the tribes of Oman belong to the Ibadhi sect, an offshoot of the Kha^arij, and the Imamate of Oman o^es its origin to the peculiar religious tenets of the Kha^arij as adopted by the Ibadhiyah. They dis allowed the claims of the Baghdad Khalifahs as ^ell in civil as religious matters and set up one of their own(Hp own ^hom they inTested with corresponding po^ern in both capacities. At first, for a period of nine hundred years. Imams ^ere elected for their personal merits or capacity. From A.D, 1624 onwards, this principle gradually underwent modification. The post was still elective but w ith a strong preference to the ruling family over strangers. The present dynasty was founded in 1744 by Ahmed bin Ss^id who was elected Imam on account of his patriotism and bravery in expelling the Persians. During his administration, his sons obtained the title of Sey- yid which their descendants have claimed ever since. iiie House of Seyyids' like the reigning houses of Sufope, has become a recognized dynasty; but the gradual increase in the number of rival and aspiring Seyyids has been one fertile source of intestinal feuds which have arrested the ■ prosperity pf the country. The title of Sultan is an extraneous one and uates .irom the time of Seyyid Sultan bin Ahmed (1792- 1 804). It is seldom used by the people of the country. The authority of the Imam or Sultan over his tribes aae always been some-hat shadowy, owing perhaps to the inac cessible nature of the mountains, ravines, and valleys of which the country consists. Intestinal feuds and ^ahabi invasions combined ith the weak and vacillating policy of recent Sultans, tne degeneracy and incapacity of members of their family and intermixture with negro blood, have gradually estrang ed the sheikhs of the various tribes. Rebellion followed rebellion until at last after the rebellion of 1913-1919. when the Ghafiri and Hinawi elements combined for the first time in opposition to the Arms Warehouse which we had induced the Sultan to establish, a fresh state was formed by Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harithi, supporting a puppet Imam of the Khalili lamily # who are identified with the Mutawwa or extremist■ |#7) -&gt;3^ extremist movement in the Ibadhi sect. H.H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman has 'been left ^ith Muscat, Matrah, and its vicinity T Thich '-ere defendedby British troopsi with the Batinah coast ■which is always vulnerable to British shipsi ^ith G-wadur on the Mekran coast; with Sur and Jaalan, the inhabitants of which supported him in the last rebellion, but where his authority is being challenged •: .t the moment; '^ith Musandum where his sover eignty over the Shihuh tribe is shadowy; and ^ith Dhofar, a province which ^e assisted him in recapturing in 1896. I attach a map showing the extent of his influence and nominal rule exclusive of Gwadur and Dhofar - The revenues of the State consist of a subsidy from Government, and a 5% import and export tax at such customs posts where it can be levied. Other revenues are neglibible. The export tax has taken the place of Zakat on dates and fish which the Muscat authorities are incap able of c-ollecting on the spot. It ^ill be seen from the above that the Muscat Government exists entirely on the support which it is able to obtain from the British Government. This is the natural result of our policy in 1913, of defending Muscat and Matrah and affording naval assistance on the coast but maintaining an attitude of non-intervention in the hinterland. As regards Oman proper and the Semail valley, the rule is in the hands of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam, but Sheikh Isa*® position at the moment is to a certain extent precarious. He has the sup]:ort of the Hinawi tribes but he has never had much influence over the Ghafiris and so there is always the possibility of some fresh claimant to po-er ousting him with the support of this faction. He has also been looking anxiously towards Ibn Saud whose agents have since 1 925 collected %akat from: from Baraini. ^ T o force has been used 'by Ibn Saud for collecting this Zakat, hut it has probably been paid through fear of Ibn Saud 1 s agent instigating neighbouring tribes to raid them, Baraimi is the key to Oman: the ^holeof the Batinah coast can be raided from that quarter with impu nity, whilst a little instigation and assistance from there to the Ghafiri tribes would bring about the collapse of Isa s administration» Should the hinterland eventually fall into Ibn Saud 1 s hands, the positionof the Suit-n ' r ould become untenable* The considerations which influenced our policy in 1913 no longer hold good. At that time operatio.ns in the interior would hare been difficult owing to the moun tainous nature of the country. A large number of troops would 'iave been required to carry them out and the result which could have been obtained -^ould have been meagre; but I venture to submit that the case is different today, A few aeroplanes in support of an effective administration- is all that ^ould be required to consolidate the country and bring about peace and prosperity. At the present moment Sheikh Isa bin Saleh is in correspondence and on friendly terms with the Mus cat Council and I thinlc in the precarious position in which he is placed, he would require very little induce ment to persuade him to throw in his lot with the Sultan. If this were done and if the administration thus formed were supported by a few aeroplanes, it would become poss ible to consolidate Oman into an efficient State and the present unsatisfactory condition could be terminated, I have the honour to be.

I doubt very lauch, however, whether your proposals really afford a eolution of our present difficulties in JIUBcat or one chat His MaJestyJa Govermaent would be ready to consider. Apparently Isa bin Baleh is now in a soisewhat weak position so that he might be induced again to coalesce with Muscat under British protection. The Muscat Government seems to be weak enough and it is difficult to see how the coalesence of two weak elements will produce strength. We should apparently only be introducing a new element in taking upon ourselves the responsibility for an outbreak between Hinawi and the Ghafiri, giving an additional inducement to the latter to appeal to outside assistance. Kor do I see how the coalition would affect the Fur question which would apparently stand very much as it d( now, except that an advance by the Hinawi or biir woul&lt;i be nominally at any rale a Muscat advance, jjut the same considerations of ap^alB to outride as istance would obtain Per son ally I am a little doubtful of the extent to which Ibn Baud is prepared at present to flout diplomatic opinion by embarking on aggre'saion and annexation, and should be inclined to think that he is more likely to content himself at the present stage with amore general widening of Ms influence. Again I OiOinct quite Bee what we are to do with a regiment at Sur unless the arrange/tent is to oe more or lean permanent. When the regiaunt leavea it will merely be the dimoulty of the shipa ooming and having to go- ae you point out- except that the Btay will he longer. I ehould imagine that the position and weakneae of Muscat which is well recognised there and the poxioy to be observea in the future will fom one of the subjects of the Committee now sitting in London, and we may very possibly expect to be asJced soon for our views, and obviously something must be done. As I am entirely strange to tills part of the country I feel considerable diffidence in expressing any views. J should have liked to come along to Jtuscat and have gone into the various questions with you on the spot, but it seems rather difficult to get away ao soon after arrival. I sl . a .

Today the fahariq (Beni Gliafir living at Adam) and Ali bin Salih bin ms r al Rasbi (Beni Ghafir of Ja'alan) with 25 horse and caiael-Een arrived at this place stating that they have come m order to effect a reconciliation between .Beni Bu Ali and the Araisa. ve told tnem tnat none of the Amirs were present at the town and on their arrival nothing will nappen but good; but if they intended to effect a settlement between the Arama and the Maithana who are present un tne town they could do so. Up to now notning further has happened so that 1 may inform you.o These affairs are ail due to tne instigations of the Amirs. They (.Mahariq and Ali bin Salih al Kasbi) have put up with Sayid tjhahab who has snowed .teindness to them and i shall inform you of further development, please send me the necessary instructions. iB regards tne imwaris (the rebels) they are still dis obedient as was reported by Sayid Bhahab. The makhana and Ghialin are cheating them by telling them that the Government would not do anything to them. iUhammad bin Kashid (Chief of Fuwaris), his cousins and his followers came to us and united with us and expressed that they would not taice any step without our agreement and that they would be obedient to the ^uscat) Government.

The trade is a large one f the Badiyah division of SharqiyaJi alone containing some 158,000 palms. lO-B. The carrier trade from Sharqiyah to ^ur is in the hand of the Hijriyin tribe whilst the Jenebeh of Sur, who are &amp; seafaring tribe,and own some 130 dhowe,convey them thence to jBombay and other ports. 10-C« a aiuail number of «fenebeh belonging to the aala section live at Izz near i4e2\«a,and in former days,the Temeemeh or Chief iiheiJch of the Jenebeh was chosen from this section# He was regarded with veneration,had despotic power and tooic 25^ on all bags of dates exported by the tribe# ^resuiiiabxy he acted as Agent for the Jenebeh in iiiiarqiyah and helped to build up this trade. By 19ou, his power had waned and a Sheikh of the Arama section,%ho are the largest section in Sur,was recognized as remeemeh. Unfortunately a blood feud,which started in 1913, be- -tween the Arama and Fuwaris sections on the one hand and tne ka^chana and uhialin on the other,undermined the in- -flaenee of tne Arama Sheiich and Mansur bin Haser of the itiajaaia section of msirah Isls.nd waa elected Temeemeh. 'ihe influence of this Sheikh over tne Arama and ifuwa- -ris sections waned and he seems to have enlisted the sympathy of tne Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali tribe for the purpose of regaining his authority.In 1927,he went to Mecca with the brothers of .Amir Mahomed bin Kaser to visit Ibn baud but died of smallpox on the return Journey# the Jenebeh,though they bear an evil reputation in slave dealing ana piracy,are not a warlike race and under normal nirciaastances could have been kept in control e iyenoagh/out JLle-f internal feuds and .ffencb. influence nave combined to let loose lawless elements amongst them* 10-D. The Bmi Bu Ali i as a tr 10c,live in the interior of Jaa- •lano Tneir principal port is AJL Ashisorsii but they have a small settlement at Aiqa on the opposite side of siur creeic to the Jenebeh arid omi about eight or ten dhows. According to iiaiyid Jsiaiioieed bin yXhmedpAiqa formerly belonged to the Hinawi# The Temeeiaeh of the Bani Bu Ali Mahomed bin Majid»occupied it under their patronage,but Abdullah bin Saiim threw off tiie Hinawi connection and made the place,purely,a Bani Bu Ali settlemnt., The Bani Bu Ali are a wild and mrlilce tribe of riffi- ^ana.

Latter to give copy to Secretary of State for Colonies, No. 132., Dated 2.4ttL Novem'ber 1928. It was on the possibility of ¥aha'bi. inter- -ference :md aggression and consequent political dialocat- -ion that the proposals for the location of a 'battalion at Sur were 'based. That there v/ould appear to he no possihility of this is indicated hy subsequent reports. Fors. the present therefore Sur may he viewed as. domestic problem of Oman. As such it is no new one and prohahly not now one of extreme urgency. It must however ha faced as part of the whole question of Muscat, which has already drifted far from the position it occupies in theory and now shows a tendency to move further. The Hinav/is, who have fallen out with the Bani Riyam and are threatened hy them with attack from the rear should they attack the Bani Bu Ali, seem likely to avoid precipitat- -ing matters. I agree with Gommander in Chief that we can obtain effective control of Sur only hy locating a battalion there but it seems to me that his limit of two years for its location seems optigListic and that the occupation is more likely to be semi-perman -ent. There seems to me to be no advantage in attempting to interfere inland. Were Sur to pass into other hands its actual retaking and occupation would be a matter of little difficulty. And wq could always without occupation imposfe a blockade to bring pressure on the tribes of the interior. On the other hand.the establishmeEic J \ establishment of Sur as a port under other control than Muscat would practically emasculate the State finances 'by its use in preference to Muscat if trade were afforded reasonable security and lower dues were levied. Further there is the present loss of dues resulting from the ineffective control at Sur. The question seems to he how far His Majesty^s Govermment is prepared to advance on the present policy of loss, bolstering up tlie Muscat State by heavy expenditure on battalion and what is gywqrx practically equivalent to occupation.

These Amirs are not strong enough or influential enough amongst other tribes to forui an independant State without considerable extraneous support* and they have been active in fermenting intri~ -gues for this purpose.ihey have also been attempting to obtain mastery over Sur,a port where they have a small settlements Sur is the second largest port in vman and if they succeed in bringing it under their control,apart from its value as a source of revenue,they would be placed in a predominant position throughout Kastem Omaiu They have evidently deemed the present a favourable time for proclaiming their independance and have hoisted Ibn Saud 1 s flag in their settlement at Sur,established a customs house there and have been interfering witn tne caravan route to Sharqiyah. There is no evidence that Ibn isaud is connected stii with these developments in any way,but certain members of the Amirs 1 family went to Mecca in 1926 accompanied by the aenebeh sheiich of iaasirah island who was in alliance with them and just recently one of the Amirs //r has left for ueddah presumably the same purpose, i whilst the head of another branch of the sultan's fa-fami ±y who a Tew montas ago&gt;stated he was dissatisfied witii Isa 'bin baleh and proposed obtaining waJmbx aid^iias just returned from a visit to Ibn aaud» ibn Saud iias however beei^ levying aaicat from .baraimi since 1926# Baraiiai is tiie key to Oman in the nortiults possession would enable the wahabis to raid the ^atinah coast with impunity and with Baraimi and Jaalan in the hands of the mhabis / the rest of Oman would fall an easy prey to them Sheiich Isa bin fc)aleh r -# tj i im i cannot afford to regard these developments with indifference^ he has part- -icular interests in Sur which is the port for the isast- -em portion of the iman^s territory^including his own tribe,whilst from recent remarlcs he has made in letters to the Council it is clear that he is somewhat nervous of Ibn iaaud# In the ordinary way it would k&amp; not have been diffi~ -cult for him to deal with the Bani Bu Ali^as he has far greater resources at his disposal,but he is evidently reluctant to do so if it can possibly be avoided^ The x&gt;ani du Ali have been undermining his position with the (ihafiri tribes in his territories^ They have openly said in letters to me that if Isa bin Baleh at- -tacked them,the Bani Kiyam^Daru and other/ u-hafiri tribes^would come to their assistance and so such action on his part would probably lead to a general conflagra- -tion throughout oinan^ A state of affairs which would render the country an easy prey for Ibn aaud subsequent- -ly and wnich Isa bin £&gt;aleh is obviously trying to sKiroid It seems also that he does not wish to take any action which might endanger his friendly relations with the Sultan 1 s 'government and indirectly with us» As regards Sur t it was always a turbulant place, having been the centre of the slave trade# A weaic administration, the undermining of the Sultan 1 s authority through French Agency and a blood feud between tiie sections of tne jeneDeh wno tnemajor portion of tne population^ were factors wiiicn made tne place an easy prey for the macHlnations^ isy befrlendxng tne wealcer side in trie 'blood feud,tixey obtained control of two of tne sections but tnejira^ and jmwaris sections opposed tnem and fougiit tliem^wiaen tiiey attempted to seize tne water supply of tiie tomi.

The gist of all these papers is that the efforts of Saiyid Shahah and Shaikh Eashid to effect^a settle- -ment of affairs at Sur have 'been unsuccessful. Your despatch No. 167-S., dated 20th April, promising a further report pointed out the economic dependence of Sur on the British Government. The threat of economic pressure would douhtless quickly 'bring the Amirs of Jaalan to their senses. In 1920 or so, when the export of rice from India [and Burma was under control,the Amirs* agent in Bombay used to hang ahout the Secretariat for days to obtain permits for the ocport of rice. 3/5/28. ltd ^ ^ c -''' At^n/U' ^ ^ ^ A ^.L.- * /4 , . ^ ,■ ■</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/441</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00019e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/441</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 35/134 I A. 40.
