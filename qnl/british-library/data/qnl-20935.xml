Dr. Harrison, as Major Dickson has already Informed you, is in India, and though there is another American Doctor newly arriv ed, he is unsuitable owing to his entire ignorance of the Arab language and customs, also he is in no way acclimatized to stand the hot journey of mid-sum mer accross the Arabian desert'. useless to mention the matter to Your Excellency.

IU The primary object of your miseion is a paeeiTe one. You should proceed to Riyadh and there report to Bin Saud informing him rerbally that under instructions from His Majesty’s Government you have been deputed • the to accompany the Nejd pilgrims to/Haj. This at the original request of Bin Saud himself. You should say that Ajab Khan, Captain, Indian Army, is already in Mecca in similar capacity to youi&gt;^self, and that he has been instructed by Hie Majesty’s Government to look to the question of rations and foodstuffs for the Nejd Party on their arrival also as asked for by Bin Saud. II. Mention nothing about King Husain’s recent wire to Cairo in which he states he never gave permission to any Nejdis coming to Mecca, but only permitted Bin rj Saud himself with 300 men. III. Try and persuade Bin Saud to take as few pilgrims with him as likely to make things generally, also his /% armed force should be kept as low as possible. You should appeal,if necessaty, to Bin Saud’s statesmanship in the matter. IV. Should you find that a very large force of pilgrims intend to start and should you gather that Bin Saud is unable to control the number without risking trouble, - \ ; then your role is to accept the situation but you should immediately report the fact by urgent message to Bahrain, 0 for transmission to Baghdad. V. Your role enrou£e to Mecca and specially as you near Hejaz, is to kkep things as quiet as possible by frifendly advice. You should discourage any signs of fanatical or hostile attitude towards things Hejaz or Shareef.( 2 ) VI o VII. VIII IX. X. XI. XII. XIII. Ok Remember that much of the success of the pilgrimage s * depends on the attitude of Bin Baud himself. As you know, he has given guarantees to Government that he will keep his people thoroughly in hand. You are present at his request to see that he carries out these guarantees and reportjiis behaviour generally. You will, probably, be met at TAIF by Shareef Abdullah, who will be deputed to welcome Bin Baud there. Possibly His Majesty^ representative at MECCA will also be there. ► In Mecca you must carry on, as circumstances permit, reporting by telegraph to Bahrain and repeating to Baghdad, any urgent matter or request. Should you want money, get same from His Britannic i Majesty’s Consul, Jeddah, quoting this as authority. Be as circumspect as you can in all things and con sult Shaikh Farhan on all matters- two heads are better than one. The latter is to be trusted. He knows Bedouin* manners and customs perfectly and will recognize certain indications or 'changes of wind' before you will. As you know, Farhan is of SHAilMAR stock. Bin Baud likes and trusts him. En route keep a short daily diary,noting especially ( l) Length of marches in hours (2) Names of camping places (3) Nature of water v j J^a/ ( (4) Nature of country on march (5) Any points of special interest, such as heat » by day and night, mountains seen in distance.

Please thank also Farhan for hia note • The main point of this letter is to tell you what you doubtless^ know already ^ that Bin Baud wrote to me just before your arrival at Riyadh saying that he couldnot •go to Haj if Govt, insisted on his limiting the number of pilgrims from Najd, and also if Govt, required him to limit the number of armed men# Bin Baud very impatiently informed Govt, that it was all its fault for delaying giving him instructions until too late, ije urgently asked for definite oxk. cmx Jw+yUrt* ■ orders to reach him in 'HI time , i.e. within four days of his~ letter- reaching me here. Failing his receiving a repl^ by 27th July he said I was to tell His Majesty*s a!' Government that he could not set on Haj this year. He, how- A ever proposed that in stead he should send a small mission off to Mecca, which moving at st speed would be able to do Haj, and afterwards would present themselvers to King Husain, and start priliminary negotiations with a view to peace - ( Bin Saud*s letter was very badly ex pressed, but this is what was understood to be the purpcfcl”) Bin Saud*s letter was sent to Baghdad clear line ar and answer as received today has been sent * him isdsy: along with this letter, conveying Civil Commissioner's wishes. These are to the effect that H.M.G. quite understands pil grimage, as far as Bin Baud is concerned, cannot come off this year, but distinctly approves Bin Saud*s stats©manlike suggestion regarding sending a special mission on to Mecca at^once even if at eleventh hour, tfthing but good can of A such mission.

Short, thiok-set, well covered, very white face, looks about 65 years of age. Wears a turban and lonr Jubbah. Corteous on first receiving members of I'isaion. :oon, however, showed his real nature. 'A man of violent and un-controlable temper. Rages against Bin Saud at all times and seasons with the rage of a weak neurasthenic old man. Just before we, the Nejd Mission, were taken into King Hussein's presence, the Sharif Abdullah made apology on his behalf saying *1 pray you make every allowance and don't contradict the old man (al shaib), you will find him quite impossible with a'head of wood', 'rasu mitbl al khashab* -. i'o my mind King Hussain is violently Anti-English, though I know, syed Siddlq Hasan does not quite agree with me. Before people and especially before the members of the Mission, the King pretended that the British Government was his friends and supporters, but in private nothing is too bad for them. He continually denounced the English for their d909l / t and doubl ® dealing, especially did he show bitterness over Sir Henry MaoMohan’s so called promises to him. King Hussein in one of his out-bursts held out his arm and bared his wrist and said » The English have encircled Arabia with a band of steel, just as^bracelet would encircle my arm. ' He gripped his left wrist with his right hand to bring home his simile. In my opinion King Hussein is certainly deeoly engaged in a wide propaganda to put Moslems generally against ,I (5) the j/jagligh and Kuropaans *wnepalljt. Thia bears out what ll0 Bin Baud told me in Riyadh later, and which I believe/haa long been trying to explain to His Majesty^ Government, King Hussein's opinionsof Sir Percy Cox are the reverse of friendly while he makes no secret of his hatred of the very name of Philby. He firmly refused to believe t that Sir Percy Cox was returning to Mesopotamia. 'If he tries bo do so I, Hussein, will nrevent him',he said ( \na ma akhalli) * dinhu hal Coxus Mocus wa hal Philby Milby', he burst out in wrath on several occasions. 'Both are the greatest enemies of the Arab race'• # Again and again he accused His Majesty's Government of sowing discord among the Arab peoples. ' If it were not forv the i^nglish*, he said ' I, Hussein, should now be ruler of all Arab speaking races. It^as England'a way, however, to first make use of me, and then to throw me over ensuring f that a united Arab nation was an impossibility 1 ', ''’ho was Bin Baud but a petty Amir who had set himself up with English gold'. ( This was said not in Ahmad bin Thaniyan's presence)/ 'ain S.ud used to receive £ \3,000/- per month from me. Be- \ cause I stopped it. Bin Baud has started all this trouble. If I gave it him again, he would lick my sandals'• This and much more in the same strain was the type of conversation I was regalled with. I had several private talks with King Hussein, I mught mention. Summing up, I think King Hussein to be a regular old fool, without the 'Siyasi' of a flee (barghooth) entire ly unfit for his position, and a pitiful example of one who might have been great, working entirely against the in terests of Arabs in general. Unfit for his position, it were better for every one if he were dead. Par better, if KaxMMxiianaHadxtS he were deposed and the late Sharif Ali of Mecca, now in Egypt, were placed on the throne instead.I ( 6 ) From what I could gather from influential people it would appear that King Hueaein is moat un-popular in Mecca. The Kalid-dar of the Great Mosque was most em phatic in this. He, of course, was prejudiced having re cently had his pay reduced. Others, however, were of the same opinion. The dungeon of King Hussein called the r cUUl&lt;to » was described to me at length whilst we were in Mecca. It appears to be a cruel and disgusting method of putting cri minals to death. Mecca is full of Effendis (Ex-Turkish Officioiils) There is no doubt whatsoever that as long as such rascals are employed by the Sharif he will never be able to put his house in order. (2) Sharif Ali» is 'Faqir', not a man. Has no push or energy. A. person altogether of most un-prenossessing appear anoe. Tall, thin, with a small head like that of a bird, he has nothing to say for himself. He has almost as bad a temoer as his father when he breaks out. All holds the title of Governor of Medina. As Assistants he has one Shahadth and Shareef bin Mansur. Ali remained in Mecca during our stay there. (3) Sharif Abdullah . is a donkey (hamar) who does nothing but eat and drink and sleep. He does not even dine among men nor does he know the meaning of a Shaikh*s 11 Majlis' or 'Mudheef'. ' He sups regular alone with his mother', and that describes him better tha* anything I can tell you. For the rest, Sharif Abdullah is good looking, and well-built, but entirely lazy. When asked by me in Joke when he was coming to be king over us in Iraq, Abdullah raised his hands with a gesture of horrori a*d said, 'Do you suppose I shall ever dream of accepting any ones invitation to go and rule over you madmen who are all 'Nifaq'. Mever while live. I am muoh more comfortable in Mecca'.Abdullah^ one topio of conversation is politics,though he seems to know precious little of what is happening in the world* Certainly in matters concerning Iraq, he is pathetic ally ignorant. (4) Sharif Shakir * is a fine up-standing man. He v claims tp be a Bedouin and lives in Bedouin style, ’’ears a 'Kafiyah' and 'Agal', in contradistinction to King Hussein, Abdullah and All, who all wear turbans or 'Ammamahs'• Shakir i however is no mors a Bedouin than you are ^meaning Major Dickson), he is a hadhri, pure and simple, but loves to pose he thinks it grand. (5) Ahmai Banajee is Wazir al Maliyah (Financial Secre tary)• (6) The Chief Qadhi of Mecca is one Abdullah As Siraj. (7) The city of Mecca is hot and un-healthy, much fever being about, police arrangements in the town are good. Out- side. Bedouins do as they please. TTT — ( E ) , LATEST NSJD NEWS . Notes on the iikhwan etc . (1) Operations in Asslr . I met Hassan bin Ayadh with his brother Mohammad; Hassan is ex-ruler of Assir. Both brothers are being kept in Riyadh by the Imam Bin Saud as Political prisoners. Hassan has just been allowed to marry a Riyadh lady, the daughter of one Battal al Hathlul. It would seem from this that Bin Saud definitely intends adding Assir to his territories. I heard in Riyadh Bin Saud appoint ed officials and amirs in Assir from the local inhabitants. % k This had caused great satisfaction. (2) Ataibah news . As mentioned previously, Shallal bin Shallyyam, chief of Al-Muggattah section of the Hejaz Ataibah endeavoured to cause trouble to the Mission, both goinf? into and ooming out of the Hejaz territory. He ie at \ present oamped in the hills near Ashairah. His men fired at( 8 ) © the Mission on both occasions, happily without inflicting casualties• The two principal Shaikhs today of the Ataibah are Abdur Rahm ,n bin Habain and Sultan bin Huraaid * Their word is law. Both are regarded as famous men in war, and are atauhoh supporters of Bin Gaud. Both have joined the Akhwan \ Bin Jaali who is one of the Shaikhs of the Rogah section of the Ataibah who recently came over to Bin Saud from Hejaz was, till last year, serving under Sharif Faisal in Syria. He has now become 'ttudaiyan' (Akhwan). The Imam has given him a house in Riyadh and has favoured him with manj gifts. His latest honour is a 'bairag' or flag given him by Bin Saud who has appointed him official collector of zikat from all sections of the great Ataibah tribe residing in Hejaz (under King Hussein). Bin Thaali’s property called Nakhal A1 Mabani lies between Mecca and Medina. He has, of course, had to give this up. (3) Riyadh Personalities . Saleh bin Adil of Riyadh, a native of Areth is today in charge of collection of all zikat from the Bedouins of Nejd proper, exclusive of Ataibah* In Haasa this work devolves on Abdur Rahman bin Maamir, at present acting Amir of Jubail. Jabir (4) Bin iXlaxl of Riyadh is another person of great importance today. He is one of the Imam’s trusted generals. It was he who recently led 2,000 Akhwan against the Harb tribe and captured Safainah and Suwairiyeh on the Mecca Msdika road* This, at the time, was duly reported by King ♦ Hussein (5) Koweit news . While in Riyadh I heard that Faisal Ad Dawish with a large force of Akhwan had attacked Jarah, near Kowsil;, where Bin Tuwala of the Shammar was oamped. Faisal captured all his camels together with 100 camels of Hilal A1 Mutair, an important merchant of Koweit. These latter will doubtless be returned as Hilal is in secret one of Bin Saud , s supporters. Feeling against Bin Tuwala was very bitter in Riyadh. He was assured of being tre scause of the whole Koweit trouble* (6) Abdul .hzIz A1 klusaad* and Ibn Ahfaisan are still in Ibha (Assir) and are in constant oommunioation with Bin Gaud* (?) Haasa news * Ibn Jarfan of the Ajman, has been bribed over by Ibn Subah of Koweit to join him. Bin Saud has,consequently ordered all Kejd and Hassa tribes to have no deelings with the Ajman unlass they become Akhwan and settle down in buildings* (8) Sultan bln Humaid, the great leader of the At&amp;iba took part in the Jarah affair. He is now at Ghat-ghat, the headquarter of the Ataibah Akhwaw* (9) Zikat. The Imam today levies 'Zikat* from all ■ the Badia tribes at the rate of one rial per forty rials If any one tries to hide part of his property in order to escape from Zikat, he is declared to be a ’•Kafir'* (apostale) and as soon as such concealment becomes known the whole of suoh property becomes liable to confiscation, as it is a crime against the 'Balt-Al-Mal' (Public treasury) to conceal property and evade payment of 'Zikat*** The zikat on camels is taken at the rate of fifteen rials per five canals, and on goat and sheep at one per forty,3^-^* (10) dowaslr news * Shortly before I returned from IF arose Mecca some trouble/among the inhabitants of the 1TT adi Dowasir and a certain Khalil was reported to have been neaten in a mosque, while another man was killed. As a result the Imam sent down his slave MUTRIF who arrested and brought the following leaders to Riyadh 1- Shiyaa Al Kharem of the A1 Bu Sabbaa Zumam bin Quwaiyid of the Aba Al Hasan * Shaiban Turk! bin Shiyea Saad bin Dharman All of the above are notables of the 'Tadi Dowasir and are now still detained in Riyadh. As will be seen later in this report I believe they were executed but I cannot be quite &gt; certain (ll) Barghas walad Hamud bin Suwait of Hajrah,lraq,( 10 ) recently brought a present of a 'Shagrah* (mare) to the Imam. He has four other men of the Dhafir tribe with him* They are now guests of Bin Shalhub, Bln Sauces right hand man. (l^) T?ew&amp; of Ne.jd . Fahad bin Haamar, 'onir of Qasim t has taken a H Ghazu M against Bin Rashid*s men. This was in October On his return to Riyadh from/o.jair visit the Imam held a great Darbar after the Jumaah prayers. There was a very large gathering and about 300 Akfcwait were present in the bin Audienoe-hall• The Imam delivered an oration starting with the quotation from the Cuaan 'Ati-ul-lah wa Rasuluh* eto (Obey God, the Prophet and your rulers) adding that he who disobeys the ruler becomes a Kafir (apostate). He then proceeded to say, '* You, 0 people of Nejd are all ignorant of religion. We went up against you and Bin Rashid in oupoort of God's word (Islam) and God heightened and glorified His word, the true religion, and granted us victory over all M Munafiqe' (hypoofites). Row every one of you has wrapped a piece of white cloth round his head and has stood up claiming religious burning and leadership : every one claims to follow the word of God, but does so only by words not by ingrained) in yoUr heats • Row all of you present here must change all this, you must prooerly understand the matter in your minds and take a warning and convey it to those who are rule over you and I shall punish most severely any breach pr disregard of my own orders as well as those of my Amirs*'. As he spoke towering above the heads of all, Bin Baud drew his sword and brandished it over his bead, greatly over awing those present. He oeased his peroration with the wo^ds ' I have nothin more to tell you*. He then immediately rose and went out. last. (IS) Return of Bin Baud from visiting Sir Percy Cox his deeds} this is purely because religion ii not ripe (well *ot present. Understand this, I say, I am placed by God toI( 11 ) The Dowasir notables,who were arrested and brought from Wadi Dowasjr were also present. Just as the Imam was leaving the hall, 20 armed slaves entered, seized and took them away. All the Akhwan were dumb-founded and oould -oaroely move out of the haLl. I regarded them closely as they were leaving the palace, and remarked that they appear ed thoroughly frightened and whispered to each other, w We must get away, we must fly'. The Dowasir Shaikhs I feel sure were executed. (14) Immediately after the events related in the last section, the Imam sent for me and received me in the big Majlis (sitting room) where there were many Akhwan Shaikhs and others present. This was only a preliminary meeting in order to exchange greetings. We oo%Ld not talk about any political matters before those sitting. In the evening the Imam sent a slave with word that he was unable to sit up that evening owing to fatigue and asked to be excused. Next morning the imam sent a slave to call me.I went and saw him in his 'Maktab' office. He received me with grpat kindness and congratulated *me on ray pilgrimage. He also said th^t his great friend Major Dickson had been asking after my welfare and was anxious about ray return. He then told me that he had met Sir Per y Cox and Mr. Philby with Major Dickson and had disoussed with them Bin Subah*s affairs, had explained that Bin Subah had nob inherited any territory outside Koweit town j that he. Bin Saud, had noth ing to do with the Anglo-Turkish agreement more especially as the Turks were now a ruined nation. He insisted he would never accept any boundaries outside Foweit. He also told me that he had spoken to Sir Percy Cox and tried to assure him that no Arab (ruler) was really friendly to the English except himself; nor oould any of them be faithful to their word. No other rulers had such large forces as himself,nor was any of them able to defend the religion as he was doing. The British Government should consider all this ani should n*not liatsm to 'aubaah' (mean fallows) and traat t’nan aa though thay thought than *Sadlq* (truthful men). Mona of them wars. Finally tha Imam said that Sir psrcy Cox had asked him if Shaikh Khazeal or Syad Talib oould fix tha boundaries bet.veen Kowelt and himself and that, ha Bin Saud had replied that ha would never aooapt either of these men as he knew thenof old. He said also that he had spoken to Sir ’’eroy Oox about his own financial conditions and had been told that all would be well. Tha abova was of course all spoken in private and in confidence. 15. Miaharl brother of Saad al Arafah died whilst 1 was in Riyadh. This should interest Sir Percy Cox. 16. Muhammad Bin Rashid, a great Akhwan Aalim who accompanied bin Masjid on tho expedition against Assir, died in Xbha. Bin Baud was much cut up on hearing of this learn ed man's death. It means a great loss to Akhwan rinks. 17. Before closing un my reuort I should like to add two final points for the information of Higher authority. These are as follows (a) The Akhwan are nob nearly as bad as T or^icrin- ally thought them, and all the wild stories one hears of them in Iraq and Bahrein are false• Bin Baud has taught them so well that the English are his friends, that whenever you go among them, if you only give out that you are.an •ffltial of the Government, you will receive a great welcome, here are fanatical fools among them, of course, but ths majority are endeavouring to purify the religion, and in time will ' be cured of this foolishness and the movement will result in good in the end. (b) The Imam has the Akhwan absolutely and entirely under control. There i? not the slightest fear they rill ever get out of hand. There is no doubt of what I say.% Appendix 'a * Liat of Principal Shaikhs of the Sejaz Ataibah v/ho have thrown in their lot with the Sharif of MECCA# (l) Shall ah bin Shlaiyan Shaikh of Ituqata.

They are practically without following, the majority of their fcx tribaemen have become 'Mudaiyanah* (yikhwan), and have moved over to M&amp;jd with their canels, sheep etc, and have acknovr- ledged Bin 3aud as their ruler. IBN THALI (^o. 7 above) quite recently went over to the camp of Bin 3aud. He has property consisting of date gardens at MAHAHI, near Medina. These he has given up to join the Akhwan.

He today is looked upon as one of the two paramount Shaikhs of all the Ataibah. (Sultan bin Humaid is the other). Shaikh Abdur Rahman is looked upon as one of Bin baud's principal fighting generals. It was he who caused so much damage to the AL HAkB during the summer of 1920, by his continuous raids. ♦I I ^ ut&gt;9) tracking powers of these wild peorle. in appearance they are tall well built, wear large bushy beards, and often wear skins in place of cotton clothing* They are well armed and used to be the terror of the Hassa Uejd trade routes before the present Bin Baud put them down. They are one of the few tribes that know the dreaded 'Rubaa al khali', or great {Southern desert. When pursued they dis-annear into its sands and only emerge to raid again, whilst they drink oaraels milk and eat camels meat. Their only other food are dates from JA3RIN, which is entirely unler their control. At Jabrin oasis are reported to exist extensive ancient ruins. No man when they date back to. Very probably they are Himyaritic remains. A visit to JABRIN 0f the Political Agent, Bahrain would be well worth while. In the vicinity of JABRIN exist vast herds of Oryx. It was from there that the oryx sent home to His Majesty the King by Bin Baud were obtained. The Murrah though under Sin .Baud’s control refuse en- tirely to become AKHWAN. Bin Baud takes Zikat from them when they migrate during the spring to Hassa. He has found it impossible to collect tribute while at Jabrin. The tribe practices circumcision, but only undergo the operation when fully grown up, and only when about to marry. They have no Alims, and the ceremony of marraige and giving in marr&amp;ige is performed by the local Shaikh and consists of the simplest of affairs resolving itself into the woman being publicly handed over to her suitor. Though they call themselves Moslems, the Murrah are very easy-goinv in their religious observances.No. 4 c -r I Dated °2nd liovepber \92(.

This is about middle of the distance between/oJAIR and HOFUF, the wretched animal must have found himself unable, after a halt, to go on any farther, and been beaten to death by the cruel Ra'i in an attempt to make him go on. We had to exchange two of our camels which had been giving trouble, sitting down every now and then * and refusing to go on ( MOHAMMAD AL AS^ad's and FARHAH’a).

Fairly big walled town of good * f * ^ * ^ appearance, with a fort inside. West part. There is also a big mosque in the fort, known as JAMIa/ IBRAHIM PASHA built years ago. Hr. PHILBI’s photographs of this and other places of in terest have been published. Good building in itself, with only one very big dome in the middle, but in comparison to our Indian JAMIAS of the PATHAtf KINGS and MUGHAL EMP8R0RS, this is of no consequence at all. The town has only two gates. We entered by the Kast gate, where there was a big crowd of Askaris and common people. Found servants standing near by in front of a house. It is our quarter * the former Turkish Rush- di or Primary school. We passed along the bazaar about two hundred yards to the AMIR , s house, where we were received by him. Here we have the great 3IN JILUVI ( ABDULLAH bin) who, of course, hue airs, talks with an amount of reserve and in a patronising tone. Has received us fairly well on the whole, and some how makes me feel that I, at least, am welcome to him, although he first took the oof fee without the usual oourt^y of sring _it ilrs t to the guest . He has reason to be proud and conceited as he has, an un-ootith Sadoo that he is, achieved what his big predecessors, the TURKISH WALI3, with high-flown titles etc. failed to achieve - peace and tranquility. He is feared and respected by high and low, far and near, for his even handed Justice, as the punishments which BIN JILUVI awards are the severest possible, beyond even the strict 'Shara hadd'. He always outs a man’s right hand for theft as soon as • a . a..* „ Without fail, it is admitted or proved before him. He beheads the murderer/ The last was on Thursday last, the day fixed for 'Hudud* pun ishments) 15th July, when an Arab (AKHWAN) was decapitated with sword for having recently killed a Jhiah Syed, whom the bigot suspected of having smoked before coming out to meet hie6 demand to sell eome goods* '^he sto^y goes that the A^HWAJI vent to buy provisions in a village; the Shiah Syed offered to supply the wants 9 and asked the Arab to sit down in the shop* and went inside for something returning after a few minutsa. The Akhwan said that he smelt of tobaooo, and that the man must have gone in to smoke ” Tou Chafir* you smoke titin* you must be butchered** 5 with these words the poor wretch was stabbed to death with Khanjar * 15. We sat for about $ hour, as it was first meeting. BIN JILUVI talked of common things, asked after Major Dickson, Shaikh ISA, yiJSUP KAHOO etc etc. He did not show interest in the talk about Hajj, which FARHAN started; shewed ignorance of the IMAM*a wishes or intentions in the matter. Came to our quarter (the former school) and found servants and kit alright, two attendants added by the AMIR, MUHAMMAD EFFKNDI with his son-in-law ABDULLAH came to see us at 6.30 P.M. Both are in- teresting relics of Turkish times in Hassa. Former is treasur er etc as before, and latter comnaratively a late arrival, young man, is a doctor.

The Amir,BIN jijuifti, invited us to coffee at 7.00 A.M. Had a good long ohat. Complains of the BASRAH TIMWS having been allowed by the Government to write things in derogation to the IMAM. The recent thing published was that BIN RASHID had severely defeat ed and annihilated BIN SAUD f a force near SHU&amp;IBAH - this was the reverse of truth etc. Shaikh SALIM of KOWSIT was doing mis chief and shall suffer sooner than later; he took hold of distant tribesmen and bribed them, and then presented them to the Political Agent, Koweit, as BIN RASHID’s men sent to him, SALIM, on a friendly errand, politioal Agent Koweit, had better be warned by Government not to listen to him etc. 17.

PARHAN and myself prayed with them at ^eghrib \ they looked at us \ askance, not at all pleased at our joining their Janaat prayer At a little distance I saw three Bedu women praying, a sure sign, to my mind, of the religion being Amml* deep-seated in these callous Bedouin hearts. They are weak, dirty, unhealthj looking people on the .whole. Some hundreds of sheep and goats and about 400 camels, vening and morning saw women going,- round milking camels. Also collecting camels' urine with which they v/aah their hair - dirty habit. It was a very amus ing sight when the camels were given water, drawn in leather buckets from a depth of about 40 feet in big wooden 'HAUDiXH' open casks, the men drawing water uttering a curious cry 'Uhokh', 'Ohokh', to encourage them to drink, as any en couragement was needed. Not a single man came to us. The Shaikh is said to be one I BN DHIPYAIYAN in KIJARJ.

At 8.90 A. . we come up 0 n high rooks with big deep ravines below, about 300 feet down. We dismount and descend slowly, the way beinr by no means easy or safe. Many a poor camel has, I am told, fallen down hers to rise no more. Rugged rooks, all round, the highest seen far. The most prominent Is called KHASHH-AL-AUSAH. ihe hills running South to North are called AL-URUMAH, with a hi- plain opening out to Weet, and a ring of black. Jet black, rooks to West and North.

In A38IF, I gather 10,000 men under ’USAID are still fighting. His son SAUD lead 15,000 men against IBN RASHID the other day, while FAISAL AL DA??ISM attacked ilARAIYAH at the head of 7,000 AKHWAN. All this must entail a very heavy expenditure in spite of usual Arab economy. In course of conversation BIN BAUD said \ of his \ that 3ALIT., KHaZaAL and TALIB were his enemies in spite of his- 17 : .j* , w O dotis not avon daign to loolr, tout turrsa hie faca as wa annroaoh neap him, and this in suite of the full Arato dress we, rather I, have adopted. But why forget that we ere 'AJanito* out-siders, |j Non-Ne^dis, and as suoh we are only fit to toe suspected and hated, even though we go to their mosque and Join their pray* er. Bhulkh ABDULLAH toin ABBUL LATIF read the Khuttoah and lead the prayers. This old gentleman is the highest religious autho* . rity in HKJ^, and has the reputation of profound learning and great piety. He is practically the Shaikh-ul-Isalam of *ejd ( (though he is nob so styled) and controls all the Ulema or learned men and Qazis, whom he appoints to the ttofassil towns and villages. Big 3AUD often spoafrs of him with great rever- iemortant enoe, and consults him in/atate affairs, always showing him a respect equal to that he has for his old father. Imam AJBDUR RAH* MAR, these toeing the only two persona whose advioe is sought and followed toy this illustrious ruler. Nothing particularly to note atoout the Khuttoah (sermon) or the prater, tooth being of the old orthodox Sunni type, that we are accustomed to in India, with the necessary WAHHABI omission of the closing prav er for SULTAN of TURKEY, who is usually styled AMIR-^-UOMINIR 'Ooramander*of-the-faithful *• 47. On returning to the p- lace after prayers, I called on FAISAL toin jvBDUL AZI&amp; and introduced FARHAR to him. FAISAL has been married recently and is proud thatjhis mari^ljgs has been noticed in English news-papers. He remembers his visit to England with lively pleasure and great satisfaction r says he would like to learn English, tout could not find a teacher in RIYADH* FARHAR suggested Mr. 7 uharomad Raushan Akhtar (pro posed secretary of the BALADIYAH, BAHREIN) as a very suitable person. FARHAR, subsequently told me that h© had also made this suggestion in a private conversation with Bill BAUD. 48. In the afternoon we called on BIN 3AUD who showed I me two news-letters he had received from his secret informers in MADINaH and BURAIDAH t these would show that the SHARIF had latterly sent an envoy in the person of one SALEH AL DAGHISTAHI18 f to irn RaSHID whom the SHARIF ia oredited to have aupplied with 7 oamel-load of guna (aptillepy) ammunition, 6,000 oaaea of arraa and ammunition and 6,000 bocces (aio) of gun-powder* I have juat written and passed this information down to BAHREIN together with DIN SAIJD's remarks about this and other alleged hostile acta of King HUS3RIW 9 s• All this is rather • disappointing, and makes one fear that these two rulers are not likely to live in peaoe* 40. ATURPAY* 31st July =14th Ohil-Oaadah * AKKAD THAN AIM called on ua and sat an hour or so. States no reply received as yet from BAHRAIN regarding DIN SAUD’s proposal to send with us a small body of NEJD HAJJ PAR**.'Y, in charge of one of the Aa-SAUD ,ruling, family. Hints that he himself may be selected for the Job. He says the IRAK 1 a mind is not a little disturbed to see that Government presses him to go to NKQGA with a very limited following and without arms. Wondered if Government really considered situation or knew the full facta about Blit SADI)• BAHREIN and BAGHDAD did not sufficiently advocate his cause, so it was ignored and nothing came of his repeated re presentations: (he even said Major Dickson had no power, but only passed BIN SAUD’s communications on to BAGHDAD, which in its turn passed them on to LONDON, that decisions were made and orders were passed in LONDON without fully knowing circum- stances and facts). I had to argue matter and lecture to him on the point to correct his views and FARHAN also spoke, till at last AHMAD saw hie own mistake. 50. In the afternoon JIN SAUD called us and took us round round his 'MUDHIF* guest-house, a big square hall with balconies in front. It is a two storey building which is just completed. In one corner on the ground floor there is the 'MATBAKU* (kitchen) where 10 or 12 huge kettles were ready with hot pulao (ric * and mutton), while some sixty** to men sat dining in three groups upstairs. They were eating out of big round trays. I was told that some of the kettles con tained 2 kakklMH goats* meat and 60 lbs rice, and others three19 © I r 5 i three go&amp;ta and BO lbs of rioe. Several aoores of men had already dined and some nore were waiting outside for their I self turn. SIN SAUi) said with an air of/aatiafaction that that feeding wae going on daily with very slight increase or de crease in number of guests and visitors who are also joined by XLLA2l f s slaves or servants. 51. i^fter the Maghrib prayer BIN BAUD called us both to his private .fajlia, and spoke filfstr about Koweit-Futair affair, which evidently worried hin a good deal. He said that he asked for doverainent 1 s intervention at the very out-set,but was told that ho had better settle it up himself with Shaikh aALIM. How that he was going to do so. Government had changed their mind, and were reminding him of his treaty obligations to submit the dispute to Government's arbitration which he was willing to do. 53. Then the conversation turned to climate and sanita tion of RIYADH and need for a doctor. Doctor HAR1I30H had been called through ?olitical Agent, but had been reported to be absent in INDIA. BIN BAUD said that Dr. HARRISON was liked in NAJD as he adopted Arab dress and manners and spoke Arabic. An ENGLISH doctor of such nature and manners and of a good moral character would be equally welcome in RIYADH. An INDIAN MOSLEM doctor was not necessarily required but only proposed by BIW BAUD in view of the general prejudice which a CHRISTIAN could gradually overcome as doctor HARRISON had succeeded in doing by visiting HASSA and RIYADH. 33. A large wooden bowl of fresh oacel's milk sent us. BIN SAUD takes this as only food at night. It is excellent to drink and very re-freshing. 54. SUNDAY. 1st. August « 13th Dhll-^aadah. At dawn several rifle shots fired in front of the palace. Reason dis covered later i a 11 Bashir' (bearer of good news) has arrived with letters for the IMAM stating the ARHWAN of 3UFAINAH and 3UWAIRAQIYAH have captured the village AL-HARRA near MEDINA. My informer adds that the AKHWAN have killed 400 i.e. nearlyall tha inhabitanta of th« f . un-b»ppy villaga, not aparinj? avan women and ohildran. They wore BAHT A^OUV-AK, • Bac+ion «( of tho nunoroua MtrraiR Arabs inhabiting the borders of the HKJAZ and ifBjd and often obanging sides Trith T &lt;IWO HU33AIH U* or dlN 3AUU, just as it suited them. SirFAIHAH *nd 31T T AIRIQITAH are inatanoes of HEJAZ villages freshly gained by the AIOIWAH and pushed forward to make still more oonquest.s for militant V/ahhabism. Nothing is nearer the bedouin heart thatt' &lt;5ha«u* (raiding plundering and rapine) and when this is sanctified by 'Tadaiyun' (lit. becoming wholly religious t now signifying the adoption of the new AKHWAIf creed) there can be no limit to the 11ADU cruelty and ferocity in cases li T 'e the above* r he IMAM • brother, AUOULLaH, is credited with an oxnresoion of abhorence to have uttered in his Majlis, with many men present, that these blind fanatics must one day be visited with the wrath of God, and be doomed to destruction* I wondem if BIN GAUD shares suoh pious or limited sentiments. Later, rhen I saw Bin vjd and asked him (after waiting to see if he would mentioh it) about the firing etc, he said it was an ordinary event : nothing of importance :a man had brought news of some fighting and so-called AKHWAN success in a distant place on the borders of MEJU and asked for a DHULUL (riding camel) as his own had died of fatigue on the roadi he,GAUD, would give the man * one, as he was accustomed to do in such cases, his was not telling the whole truth* 55. At noon wrote letters to BAHREIN, then tried to sleep but could not, owing to heat and flies, the latter a great nuisance and seem to be ever-growing* ^hinkha and hand- fans are a great necessity and we employ both as much as possi • % ble. &gt; 56. After 6 ASR (afternoon) prayers Bin Gaud sent us horses and we rode out and met him on hie way to the Badu camp, outside WIYADR* din Gaud was riding a very fine raare^ a thorough-bred Arab from Jabal Ghammar, the best that I have * * * seen. Hie sons GAUD and FAISAL and brother ABDULLAH, several cousins and about two dozen attendants accompanied on good21 mares. Bin Saud talked on horses and pointed out various gar dens and buildings on the way. Reaching the oanm, we sat in a big open tent in the oentre of some 200 'Buyut Shaar' (tents) scattered over a distance of l£ miles all around. The host is one SUjAIHI (?), a nice old Badu who has charge of the Iman^s camels* Sat about three quarters of an hour, had the three rounds of coffee, and all the time Bin Saud talked of camels, their uses, kinds, diseases &amp;c. &amp;o* There was a bustle as hundreds of camels were returning from the Wadis after the day*i grazing, and were formed into batches and taken to water on a large well close by. There were over 200 white camels which were part of the recent booty from BIN RASHID, of which the Imam*s share alone is said to be 3,000. These are distributed over several different places for convenience of grazing* Prayed Maghrib with the Imam and party, and noticed a slight softening of Wahhabi (Akhwan) faces around : perhaps, we were, after all, regarded as some-what like themselves, nsetfdo-Moslems, if not Moslems* 56l&lt;v| Monday. 2nd August = 16th Phil ftaadah * Wrote letters to Bahrein. BIN SAUD is again preparing to send a Ghazu against BIN RASHID. He told me that the youthful BIN RASHID was only a puppet in the hands of his uncle IBN AJAL, who was very anti-Bin Saud* His policy would prove suicidal* Most of the SHAMMAR and townsmen of HAIL hated IBN AJAL, whose downfall was only a question of time. The SHARIF and Shaikh SALIM both tried to incite and help BIN RASHID* SALIM and BIN RASHID had sent letters and presents to She SHARIF through a KOTEIT merchant who has a branch in BOMBAY. Bin Saud said his position was made difficult by the' fact that he had to deal with a foreign power. He was not free to do what he liked with those who troubled him* If he were let alone by the ENGLISH he could finish it up in no time with the SHARIF, with SALIM and BIN RASHID* He did not want conquest : he only wanted rest and peace. If hejjxoi been compelled by circumstances to pull on he would have left the country and gone to live in distant island ■22 or aora® unknown corner of the world, and there worshioned &lt;*od. 57. Information received, one AB3A3-AL-FALLAJ arrived from SYRIA ten days ago : probably a secret raeeeenper s la oarap Ing outside RIYADH, near Imam's garden. Has 5 horses and several attendants. Is said to have come thrice before. 58. Two big AKHWAK MULLAS, MOHAMMAD 3IH ABDUL LATIF of ARTAWIYAH »ud ''ABDUL C KZ1Z 4 A»OARI of 3ADKRAH, ars alno vialtln* the Imam today. 59. In the evening (8 to 9 P.M.) the Imam read out a portion of HADITH (traditions) to a large gathering of MULLAHS and other vialtors from the raofasail in hia Majlis and then de livered a lecture or sermon on obedience to Ood and His Prophet as an ssaential qualification of a Muslim and a MOMIN (true be liever). I could easily hear every word he uttered as I was on the next roof. An Aalim, probably Shaikh ABDULLAH Bin ABDUL- LATIF, strongly supported what the Imam had said quoting from AL-QURAH. the 60. I am afpaid it is getting rather late for/HAJJ. BIN BAUD has not had Government's answer as yet, and we are strained in RIYADH. 61• TUESDAY. 3rd August » 17th Dhll^Qaadah . with Bill 3AUD' s permission FARHAIf and myself went and saw the old Imam ABDUR RAHMAH at hia house. He ia a nice old man, look^s over 70, of short stature, rather dark and stout, with hina-dyed beard of medium size. Talks slowly in a low voice and wears a contented look and a pleasant smile. Asked me what part of INDIA I cane from and where I learnt my Arabic.Was glad when told that Arabic was taught in public as well as pri vate schools in INDIA. Also said that my name was familiar to him, as he had heard it many years ago when the famous Wahhabi Maulvl SIDDIQ HA3AN KHAN carried on his oampain Af religious lectures and debates throughout INDIA and HEJAZ, more especially MKUOA, where he was reputed to have 'defeated* the Ulama of the other SUNNI sects in public debates. It may be noted that this gentleman is the author of several Wahhabi books. He rose in lift/ I i s, &gt; « 1 33 by dint of his great eloquence, and knowledge, and narried the last Begum of BHOPAL, 3ULTAH JAHAIf BEGUM ( mother of the present Begum), whereupon he was styled HAWWAB SIDDIQ HA3AH KHAN. 62. The old IMAM also asked ua about SHEIKH ISA's health and the welfare of hia sons, and orofeaaed his good will and regard for them, calling them the best 'HAMULA' (tank** house). BIN BAUD also Joined us after a quarter of an hour. I was not a little surprised to see him stoop low down, kiss hia father's hand, and then sit at a distance, near the ordinary 'HASHHAH* (adherents) of hia father. It did impress one to aee this wlae, capable and strong ruler, who is so much feared and respected ✓ by all, pay so great a respect to his old father. I have come to know since our arrival here, in RIYADH, that Bin Gaud takes his father's advice and counsel in all important matters, more especially in matters concerning his relations with those out side NEJD. We conveyed Major DICKSON's salaams, and the old IMAM accented them with pleasure and uttered the usual prayer and good wishes in reply. BIN BAUD was so kind as to commend us both to his fathsr, who blessed us. After having a little more ordinary talk and two rounds of coffee, we returned to our quarters. 63. We passed the day In-doors, feeling rather dull and worried. In the evening, after Maghrib prayer. Bin Gaud called us to his private Majlis, and told vtkh.ua with evident satisfaction that his own proposals had been accented by Govern ment, and he had just than received Major DICKSON's letter con veying SIR ARNOLD WILSON's approval of same and his appreciation of BIN SAUD's statseman-like solution of the problem. He would, accordingly send a representative with us in charge of as many NEJDIs as may be ready to go to MECCA for the HAJJ. Time was very short but we oould reach by riding light and fast. After % some discussion BIN SAUD fixed THURSDAY, the 5th August for our departure to MECCA. A great relief.

He very kindly said that he steeped in to see if we did not want anything and were oomfortablsj that he had been telling his men dally that we must bs wsll looked-after, and had bean sending AHMAD THAHAITAH and 3IH SHALHUfl to be quite aura of that} that he had been taking our own word that we were quite comfortable. I aasured him that we did not want any thing and thanked him for his kindneea and oonaideration. He also aald that he hoped that w# did not mind hie not visiting us in our quartsrs till then, but thaUdld not like to disturb us, and preferred to meet us in the ROSEAU or the MAJLIS, both being about midway between his office and our quarters. I said, it was quits immetarial and we were extremely obliged for his excellent hospitality and great regard always shewn us from the moment we had arrived in his capital. He also s .i ’ - r f25 f « f . havjs fo^md th« tin® hanging rather heayily as there were no books or news-papers to read nor any plaoes of interest to visit, X recited that i had the 'Sabaah \fualliqah * (old chivalrous Arab poems), V Manasik Al^HaJ3'(on the pilgrimage to ’feooa), two useful and interesting books with me to read, and sometimes wrote letters , morning and evening; the greater part of the day was too hot to allow of any reading or writing, ^e oould • not even offer the Imam the commonest thing, ooffee, as our coffee-boy had looked up the room and gone out. 3o, I had to , content myself by appologising and saying that after all it was his own house, and we his own guests * he would kindly excuse the shortcoming, whereupon Bin Saud repeated his favourite couplet ^y^cly^ (0, our guest, if you visit us you will find that we are (like) guests and you (like) the host), and then departed saying that he was going to Shaikh ABDULLAH BIN ABDUL LATIN’s, whnnnxhsxwcs to try and reoonoile this powerful old Shaikh to a number * of * ^UTA , dIAH , (mullas or priests^ who have been summoned for dis obeying Shaikh ABDULLAH 1 a injunctions regarding public preaching and disposal of oases &amp;o.

Inwardly, I thought, perhaps the old Imam Ad OUR RAHILiH, whom we had visited the previous day, was responsible for sending Bill BAUD to see us. ^• A little later BIN BAUD sent FARHATf and myself, one volume •*oh, of ths booko'T^ ( y &amp; 'C&gt;^&gt;-(Hlatory of Hojd and Wah habi movaraaat).

He, theyi said that he had ord irad a '^ahmil' (open box-like thing tied on oarael for riding in) for me, as he feared that ordinary 'Shidad' (camel* saddle) riding would be too nmoh for me in that hot time of the year* I thanked him heartily and then we aaid good-bye to this perfect *entlsraan and wise ruler at about 9.45 p.¥., as he advised us to start at 4.00 A.11. next morning and to await AHMAD THAHAIYAH and his party in DARAIYAH.

It will be noted that we donot and oannot bother about dinner since leaving , OARAHAH, as that would be too much of a luxury and, what is more, would waete two or three hours of the night, the suitable time for travelling. Tea with milk and biscuits etc. make a substitute for dinner. Besides, one oould hardly ride on a camel six or seven hours running after taking dinner. It would also induce sleep which was so much to be avoided. iO 5 * MUQHIKAH was reached after 18^30 A.’&lt;.

These are better looking desert people than any met with so far, and their women are comparatively well-dressed and wear silver and gold rings and ear-rings.

Ordinary conversation wont on for a few minutes, than I asked him what prosnoot there was of starting the work for which the Noid Mission had come to ”ecca. Amir Abdullah replied that it was for that reason that he had wanted to see us, as,the HaJi being over, it was time to set to work* He wanted to tell us certain things beforehand, in order that wa might be fore-wamad and bear them in mind in the course of discussions and negotiations to follow* r than v ed him very much saying I looked to him for his wise consul and sincere and useful advice which would help in smoothing matters for the , good of all concerned* He then said that the ohi^f thing for ua to know waa that we had, in the person of Kin* Huaaeln, a very difficult man to deal with. Hia Haahinite *aJoety waa moat kind-hearted, peace-lcvin* and far-aeeinK, hut, at the aame time, moat obstinate, excitable and un-ooranromiaing. 'e ahould, therefore, be ready to exoeroiae the (Treat,eat oars and patience etc. *\nir Abdullah then said that he wanted to as iure me that he waa not apeakin* officially, nor did he hold any State office at th© tine. H© had lately resimad th© Nazarat- Kharajah (Foraign Secretary’s post) owing to difficult situa tion resulting from diffsrences hstwsan th© British Agent, Ool* Viokary and King Husaoin. Incidentally, he remarked that OoloneJ Vickery’s policy had been aggrsssivs, an'l on account of him a ragretable 'Barudah' (coldness) had been caused between is Majesty’s Government and th© King; that the Jolonel had gon© to England avowedly on leave, but was not likelt to return to3. Hs want on to say that ha was personally anxious to saa strife and blood-shed between the inhabitants of the He,la® and Nejd stooped once for all, and peace and tranquility rest ored. He himself would do all he oould to secure that object for the good of his own motherland, Arabia, the hone of Islam* If Arabs went on quarreling and fighting arong themselves, they would be waakened, and would, eventually, fall a prey to the avarice of stronger nations, Christians and others, who would then naturally rule over them as they liked etc. etc. 4* There was a pause. I complimented him on his oatriot- ic views and true Muslim sentiments which were praiseworthy, adding that it was rather fortunate for Arabs that they had secured the sympathy and good will of a very great, powerful andjust nation, the British, who were their neifirhbours and had already given ample proof of friendship and had shown so much solicitude and readiness to help and guide Arabs. Parhan sun- . ported me in a few appropriate words, and Amir Abdullah laugh ingly said that he atot did not want to accuse any one, but he was only remarking generally, though he oould not see why Great Britain was supporting France against Arabs in Syria, while Arabs too, like the French, were their allies, '^here was no point in arguing the matter, he said, and proceeded to say : 5. 'Bow,about iiin “aud. He is really nothin.- but *A^ir —i—Nejd*, as were his forefathers ’Uraara—an—HeJd*, like sever al other chiefs in Arabia. Till lately the Sharif of ”eoca used, so to speak, to beat and soold him, and his forefathers before him, whenever he or they proved troublesome or refractory and misbehaved in respect of the Hejaz in Turkish times. Abdul Azis himself was always in fear of the Sharif of Mecca, even more than he feared Sin Rashid, who has so recently inflicted a severe defeat on him. His Majesty,, ray father, advised by the British Government, started to give him a subsidy during the WAR, although he rendered little or no asnistance in return, but was always deceiving both the British as well as ourselves-' 1 ' what we have done for the British and the allies is known totha whole world, and I naad not spaak about that now. It is only about two yaara ago that tha King stormed Bin baud’s sub sidy and ha got annoyad# Ha than prot up sons extra power by means of his unscrupulous ways, ohiefly by cunningly appealing to the fanaticism of an already fanatic class, the ^ahabis of Nejd who are most wild, ignorant Bedouin, incapable of under standing the true principles of Islam* No doubt Abdul Aziz is \ clever and possesses great powers of intrigue* He is incessant ly spreading his propaganda and, what we fear most, is mislead ing our own Hejaz Amirs and Sheikhs, and tribesmen to rebel against the king* Some have already become disloyal, and even • our own Ibn Aram (cousin) Khalid, the Amir of KHURMA, has turn ed traitor* You have just been among them and, being a Tf uslim \ yourself, can well understand that their so called ’Din*(creed) of Akhwan is an abominable ’Bidaat’ (fad)* Neither the book of God, Al-Quran*, nor the •Hadith*,(Tradition) of the Holy prophet ever taught such things as they are doing now in the name of religion* For instance, where is the text forbidding the use of tobacoo* No where at all in the Quran* Then do the Akhwan brand a smoker as ’Kafir* (heretic) and kill him as such* I had to confess to ray own sentiments of hatred for the Akhwan, and his extreme intolerance and fanaticism* I said, quite however, that I oould not/see how far Bin gaud was nersonally responsible for or connected with the movement, adding that he - had been known to have blairaed and cursed the Akhwan at times* To this Amir Abdullah replied that that was doubtless a ’Hilah* (triok), and ’Siyaaah’ (policy) of Abdul Aziz, who had really % invented the Akhwan to serve as a tool for his own ambitions and was using that tool with scruies* » 6* The Akhwan movement, Amir Abdullah said, was an un mistakable ’Fitnah* (trouble or turmoil) against which the Holy fore- prophet had/wamed Muslims in his lifetime, as , it is stated, that onoe when asked to bless NBJD, he said, 'Innaha Qarnun min qurun-ish-Shaitan, tabtadi minha-al-fitan wa tantahi elaiha' (it is a horn of the Satan, turmoils or commotions will ariseusm ■■■■■ therain firat and last)* ualims of all landa, raors aanaoially thoaa of Arabia, oould not but rerrard that novaroant with auani oion an ' abhoranoa* It was balnr; olaverly anrinaarad an^? was spreading lifcs wild fira, so raueh so that all naiwhbouring paoplas wars troubled, and evan the Hejaz, which had the two holiest places of Islar? in it, was seriously menaced* ''a should think what the plight of millions of Muslins in the Hajaz, es pecially in Mecca and Medinah would be if (God forbid) Bin *-aud and his devilish vkhwan succeeded in over-running the Hejaz ^ taking possession of the two Harems of God and His nronhet, which wera annually visited by many thousands of Huslims coming from all parts of the world, 'ould the Indian Muslims coma for the Hejaz in such an event, ha asked me* I said, I did not thir$ that many of my countrymen would be able or willing to make the pilgrimage if Holy Mecca were put by Providsnve under \khwan / regime* No one could bear such intolerance as they showed in religious matters* 7. jjnir Abdullah proceeded to say that their difficulty did not lie so much in Uin aud and his fanatic band as in something else i din laud appeared to have the strongest sun- port of the British at his back, as his hostile actions against the Hejaz had been looked upon by the British Government with evident complacency or equanimity and little or nothing had been done to atop or discourage him, while King Hussein had l constantly been told to do nothing and ait quiet* *^he result was so serious a loss to the Hejaz which had been shorn of its districts of KBURMA and TARRABAH and only latterly of HIGHAH, RANJAH, ft UF AIN AH, SUWAIRAQIXAH and ASSIR had been taken only why we had been on our way to '&lt;ecca on a deputation of peace* It was impossible for King Hussein to remain quiet any longer. Something must be done in self-defence, be it even in disregard of iritish advice etc* 8* I expressed my surprise at his remarks about the atti tude of His flritannio Vajssty’s Government, and said that there ought to he no misunderstanding about that* I oould assure himthat tha Govamm^nt had never auflported or avon countananoad din ’uud'a hostila actions arainat tha Hejaz, but, on tha con trary, they had often blaned din 'laud for tha various Ahhwan attacks on thafrontiar of the Hajaz, and also takan him to task on more than one occasion, notably flhen the Akhwan threatanad TAIK, after taking PAKR.\3AH« I added that ha knew as w^ll as I did that tha British Government had dona and ware doing much more to help King Hussain than they had to Bin ’aud, and tha mission was tha latest proof of British good will towards Kinr Hussain and, to a lesser extent, towards Bin *aud* 9# Amir than spoke a little about how ha lost T ARAB AH, his force was small though wall-aquipnad, and the vast sunsr- iority in numbers aided by a mere chance, a foolish mistake on his own part in allowing the Badu messenger of din *aud, who V ■ was a brother of our guide, fagar-al-Atawl, to coma right into his camp, and than letting him return to tha Akhwan, gave them the day* Ha said the Akhwan losses ware unnraoadentally great, for they ware mown down by hundred® as they came blindly on under his machine-guns* He took nains to describe how he and his staff officers held up to the last moment whan ha was simply draggad away by Shakir, and nut on a mare, while friend and foe were mixed up, fighting indiscriminately and falling around his tent# 10* A few complimentary words ware nut in by me and Parhan consoled him by relating the Arab proverb •Al-Harb Bajal*, which purports to say that fortune often varies in war 11* Turning to his original tonic, Amir Abdullah said that Bin aud* s gains ware ill-gotten, and such, they ware sura to be lost again, one day or another•His success and pride were due only to his ounning propaganda, to whioh he gave the names 'Din' (religion) and 'Tadaiyun' (religious awakening)* It was only an intrigue, a sham. r hat if he had got up some material power, his position was morally weak* He had sold himself to others* and was no longer even an indenendent ohief, but ruled under British suzwranity* They had had doubts about Bin Aaud’spoaltion ani thy Jritiah attitude 9 which had boan ol^arod by ^.n official doouinant# Anir Abdullah than took out tho doou- rather tnynt ha refarrod to* It was, I was/surpriasd to sea, an Arabic lithographed copy og the Treaty of 1915 with Bin 5aud, which was concluded by -ir Percy Cox. He read out the narag^aph stipulating that Bin Saud could not sell, gift, or otherwise give, any land within his own territories to any foreim power or foreign subject without the previous perraioslon or consent Britannic of His xxl&amp;txft ajesty’s Government, also the one which pro mises to help and protect Bin laud against any foreim attack# He then went on to say that all that and more had been surmized by the Hejaz Government, and other suspicions had been confirm ed on reading the Treaty in question, copy of which they had taken care to obtain officially. They then saw that Bln laud had been so openly aggressive without fear, while King Hussein had been advised*not to do anything. They feared that any action or counter-attacks from their own side would be active ly opposed by the British Government who had promised to help and protect Bin aud. They also felt that Bin laud’s territor ial gains at the expense of the Hejaz meant British gains, and the independence and integrity of the Hejaz were being threat- ened. It was their duty and their firm resolve to maintain their own independence at all costs, as they had gained it by means of the’Hahdhah’ at a great expense, and with t&gt;&gt;e great- est sacrifices etc. 12. I.said that no one had reason to doubt British good will for king Hussein, and least of all should he, Amir / Abdullah, entertain such doubts. Both King Hussein and Bin saud were friends of the British Government, who had, consequently, always tried to compose their mutual differences, and it was impossible that Government should favour Bin ’aud at the ex pense of King Hussein. But Government would, in the interests of peace, endeavour to settle all outstanding disputes by means t of friendly advice to both sides, and if necessary, by arbitra tion. I also pointed that the Treaty with Bin aud did not adversly affect the Hejaz in any way. Amir Abdullah then saidthat thsy itm hafl hop^B British frianrlahiT) and «ood will and abovs all, their juetioe and fair pXay} that he himself aa their friend, and was evan auapeotad to have leanings toward* tha English. IS* Ha then said that the Hejaz had every thing to rraln by dritiah friendship and support, and her strength and inde- England would have then a friendly Government in Arabia capable of reform and progress; while oin Saud oould not be so useful a friend to the dritiah* His extra influence or power was only temporary; if he died the next day he would leave behind an tn ignorant and fanatic people who would struggle and fight among at themselves, only to perish or to fall under foreign yoke,as they were absolutely incapable of any reform or progress etc* It would be beat for Bin Saud himself to unite with v'ing Hussein and work together for the common good od Arabia* 14* As we had been sitting nearly two hours, I hinted to close the interview by saying that I was glad to have had the honour of meeting the Amir and honed that he would help the Mission by explaining its object to His ajesty King Hussein, and arranging for an interview between the king and the Mission, so that friendly exchange of views might take place* This he promised to do and we took leave of him* was a great admirer of the British nation, was generally known pendenoe would not only benefit Arabia, but England also, as i• f*. (S-j) ) 1. On tha morning of Sunday, tha 29th August 1920, AbIp . bclullah cull id raa to Join him at tha palaoa. I want acooirmaniad by Karhan iJag, and found the Amir sitting alone in his room. 0* The first thing he said was that Ahmad Thanaiyan had ask ed for, and had had, an interview with Kin* Husain, the previous avsning, in Y/hich hs asked the king to have all discussions in private, that is, only between tha King and himself and not in my own and Parham*a presencej that the king had refused to accept- that proposal and told Ahmad Thanaiyan that it was the British Government that had arranged to send the Mission with special Indian officer and that no discussions or negotiations could be carriod on without British representative being present# 3* I thanked Amir Abduliah and said that what the King had • decided was the best for all concerned# Inwardly, I wondered why such a proposal was put forward by Ahmad Thanaiyan# He himself met me daily before and after that day but never said a word of that* He did not even attribute any suoh proposal or suggestion to King Hussein or to his sons, all of whom he managed to visit 'alone, more than onoe. I was, therefore, convinced that Ahmad Thanaiyan must have made the proposal, though I could not and cannot still understand why he did so. My only idea is that hav ing been sent to Meooa on an un-pleasant task, he wanted to spoil it, and the easiest way to do this was to have one or two private \ meetings with the king, with or without his sons present,avowedly for friendly discussions and negotiations, but really for being able tp give the subject matter of suoh meetings any colour that might suit his own ends or to break off on some pretext, or otbe~* He might possibly have secret instructions to do so, because his^ principal, Bin Baud, himself was only with difficulty persuaded and practically sent the mission against his own will* 4* Amir Abdullah then said that he wanted to give me a proof of what he said about Bin Baudp namely,♦that he was constantly spoiling thai'r Amirs, servants, tribes eto. He showed me a letter ( whioh I scrutinised and found to be Bin Baud’s) addressed to one Muhammad bin — (l forget full name) who is the headman of a€■ village near ThIP anl has the charge of King Husain*a canala: in remain in TAX? or viait it again? if they did ao, he. Bin ^aud # would tell hia people, the i ualima (Akhwan), to attack and capture should be careful to follow his own advantage; he should Join Khalid, the Amir of Fhurma, and taka his advice and follow hie instructions; the Muslims (Akhwan) were quite prepared to advance on TAIF and thought nothing of the liharif and his sons, etc. 5. Amir Abdullah commented unon the wording of this letter whioh he said was very cunningly written and was a true snecimAn/ of iiin Baud's subversive correspondence which poisoned many minds and incited simple and unthinking or ill-disposed dheikhs and Amirs of the Hejaz to be disloyal to their king. It was thus that the Amirs of KHU1WA, T ARAB AH, BI3HAH and RAN J AH had been mislead and had turned traitors to King Husain. These were, in Turkish times and thereafter, under the Hejaz an 1 used to receive regular salaries from Mecca, a fact which could be proved by documentary overweaned. ome of the 'Ataibah had even left their friends and property behind and gone down to Nejd; but they would one day break off with Bin Baud who oould not possibly afford to give them large bribes for long, while their 'Din' (religion) and 'Tadaiyun' (religious awakening) was in itself disgusting to all Muslims. Bin Aayidh of AISIR had just been overwhelmed by hordes , •M.aa MS-vtn v* /-» + +&gt;&gt;*»+ Vi a waa fl. 'P — •? evidence. Bimilarly had many of the numerous 'Ataibah tribes been♦ yy indirectly from out of the Hejaz territory was, thus,/gained for the British; but this could not be suffsred at any cost. Kinp; Huseein had loni? been fearing that is his forces advanced to check Bln Baud, they would find themselves opposed to British forces* 6* I had to protest that I was surprised and sorry to hear such remarks from a person of high rank and great enlipditemnefct like the Amir and could not believe that British policy could be so mia-understood* King Husain being the greatest and most esteemed friend of the British Government could not reasonably entertain any ouch doubts or fears from their side, more especially when . His iKifclEli Britannic Majesty's Government had actually taken steps to prevent aggressive actions of Bin 3aud and had clearly shown their displeasure on more than one ocassion* It was time that both sides acted in a spirit of reconciliation and made the best use of the opportunity offered them by His Britannic fajesty't Government, in the shape of the present mission, for settling their disputes in an amicable way* 7. At this juncture we were called over to the King's room at the other end of the 4»sr, Amir Abdullah accompanying us, apo logising for keeping so long before seeing His Majesty who, he said, had desired him to oome with us for 'kalam khususi' (pri vate talk) or a priliminary exchange of views. 8. We, accordingly, met King Huaein In the •Makhalwan' (private office) where we were received with much courtesy and kindness* As soon as we were seated, the King began to speak, in a rather low tone, saying thAt his son Abdullah had told him about our conversation of the previous morning; that His Majesty was pleased to know that we wanted to start the work for which the Mission had oome and that he prayed to r ’»od for a successful issue* I thanked His Majesty in a few words to which Farhan added a few more, including a prayer for his long life* 9* The King then proceeded to say that Ahmad T ’hanaiyan had been to see him the previous evening* Although he was not feeling quite well, yet he did not like to dis-aproint Ahmad Thanaiyan who asked for a private interview for the first time after arrival in Mecca* The King found Ahmad Thanaiyan had little to talk, but4 only aok that frl#nclly diaousaions and napiotiationa ba carried on only between himself and the King and hia aona f and not in our presence* The King had rsolisd that he could not agree to that proposal which, if acted upon, was not likely to bear fruit* Ahmad Thanaiyan waa obviously much dis-apoointed at the Fin^s reply, but did not press or argue the noint* 10• I said that Hie ’ajesty's answer was quite correct, and hia decision was the best for all* 11. Amir Abdullah made a few remarks to the effect that there must be something that proposal. He waa interrupted by King Hussein who said that he could not arree to independant discus- i sions or negotiations siraoly because the Government had arranged to send the Mission, and, consequently, their representatives must be witnesses to all proceedings* He had little trust in Bin i 3aud, and still less in his cousin and representative, Ahmad Tha naiyan* It was only because of the British intervention that he i had decided to meet Hin Baud, who, however, had somehow changed his mind, and,instead of oominp: personally, had sent an agent* He wondered how or why such a change had been allowed by His Britan nic Jfajesty’s Government. Bin Baud had never shown any inclina tion to make peace with him, but, on the contrary, had always persuaded a policy of aggression and' active hostility, by which he had already succeeded in taking possession of so much of the Hejaz territory, and gained extra power and importance* The Firg himself had exercised the greatest patience and waited so long to see if things were put right by His Britannic Majesty^ Government in whom he had full trust* He felt as if he had neglected his duty of defending his own country and preventing Bin Baud’s in- roads on the holy land which it had pleased God to entrust to hia care* He himself, like any other true Muslera, was most disturbed in mind at the prospect of growing religious fanaticism in Arabia, a the land of Islam* The Akhwan movement,/creation of Bin Baud’s, was the most dangerous propaganda by means of which the '’ahhabis of Nejd wanted to prevail upon the whole of Arabia, and violate the Harems of God and His prophet* No Huslim could bear to think .5. of th» dira oon*§aqu»no6s to Islam that woujd follow If sin Saud and his Akhwan took Mooca and Medina. All the world knew what atrocious acts of sacrilege were pemetrated by the Wahhabis when they had captured the holy city under FAISAL bin SAUD* The i King had his hopes in God f he looked un to Great Britain to sun- port and defend him, their friend and ally. 12. I said that, please God, His Majesty's hones would be realized, and His Britannic Majesty's Government would surely more especially in the Hejaz, both for his own sake, and in the interests of Arabs and Islam, as Great Britain was the greatest friend of Islam. 13. The King seemed rather pleased and twToe said *Barak- Allah fik, ya ibni', a complimentary phrase he often used later to express his satisfaction and good wishes. 14. I, then, asked His Majesty when he would be pleased to give the Najd Mission the auspicious opportunity of a friendly diecuesion and exchange of views, and ho readily replied that we could see him again with Ahmad Thanaiyan, next morning, when he would say all that he had to, and let his 8ons,Ali and Abdullah, co-operate with us to decide what was best to do. His Majesty added in a rather pathetical tone that he, an old man, was abso lutely unable and unwilling to see strife and bloodshed among Muslims, and feared most lest he might be to blame for that in any way before God, on the Bay of Judgment. 15. Amir Abdullah hinted to me, and I took His Majesty'* leave with a few words of thanks, and the usual prayer of his long life. The King rose as we approached and shook hands with him, before leaving his room. e \ y restore and give all help that they possibly could to/maintain peace in Arabia, %third meetie g . Early on Monday morning, 30th Auguat 1920, I called on Ahmad Thaniyan as he had had fever the previous evening* I found him better and brought him along to our quarters where we breakfasted and talked together* I gave him a guarded version of our last morning 1 s conversation with Amir Abdullah and King Husain and tried to impress upon his mind that the King and his sons were in correct mogd and showed / much readiness to adjust am matters with Bin Baud* and said that it was up to him to try make the best of that opportunity by acting in a broad-minded way and showing a similar spirit of reconciliation. Ahmad Thaniyan betrayed some suspicion as to the object of our private meeting with the King and his son and also expressed his doubts as to the bona-fide of their intentions etc. , but eventually assured me that he would do all he could to smooth matters. At 9 A.M. we went together to the qasr and were received by Amir Ali in his room. 11-Lewa Sadiq Pasha, Attache to British Agent, Jeddah, who had come with the Mahmal, was also there. After a few minutes 1 ordinary conversation, Amir Ali took us to the King* s room, where Amir Abdullah, Abdullah As-8iraJ the Qa*i-ul-Qasat and Sharif Shakir were summoned by the King and joined us soon. An exchange of usual enquiries after one another's health having had, while coffee went round, the King addressed Ahmad Thaniyan and said that he was very pleased to meet the Mission especially the able representative of the illustrious Amir Ibn Baud whom he had looked forward to meet in person, as also the honoured representative of H.M»s Government. There was no real enmity or ill-will between kimsief himself and Bin Baud whom he regarded with the highest esteem and honour as the Head of the great and noble house of Al-Baud, the Amirs of Nejd. He himselfmmmm © himcelf was the descendant of the Holy Prophet whose progeny were entitled to what the Holy Quran clearly said 'La asalulcura alaihi min ajr ilia al mawaddata fil qulkha' ( quoting the Prophet's words meaning C I do not ask you .Muslims, for any recompense for my serTices to you except you love for kith and kin ; ) • He himself had, thus, a £ God-given claim to the love and goodwill of all Muslims whose servant he was* l Ahmad Thaniyan assented and said Bin Baud, too, regard^ His Majesty as father and was anxious to come and kiss his hand, hut time was too short for Bin s aud to arrange to come personally which he might do next Hajj season as he had not performed the pilgrimage so far and was very desirous of discharging that religious duty* I supported Ahmad Thaniyan in a few words adding that Bin Baud had expressed to me his great regret at not being able to come and have the tWo-fold pleasure of Hajj and meeting His / Maj esty* The King then proceeded to say that he wanted to assure the Mission that he most regretted the existing situation and strained relations between the two sides, both being Muslims and neighbours* Above all, he was most anxious to see strife and blood shed among Muslims ended for good and all* Apart from former events which were too well-known to need mention, the latest bloodshed in Sufaiiiah and Suwairaqiyah and last of all in Assir had very much pained him and his heart bled for poor help less Arabs, the inhabitants of those places, who were not only his bretheren in Islam, but also his own subjects and adherents. Even their women and children had been killed by the Akhwan and only God knew howjnany of them had pxwsi: perished* He was sorry to hear even of the imprisonment ofTRamir Beg As-Saadun in Iraq, and then how much more could his sorrow be for the hundreds of men, women and children killed in his own country* He called God toto witness that he did not seek any personeLl gains* territorial acquisition or self-aggrandisement* He t in his old age 9 could not coYet any conquest or annexation, but only wanted xeet and peace and sought the integrity of his own territory of the Hijaz. His Majesty then took up a map which lay rolled up on his table nearby and showed us Bufainah an^ Sctwairaqiyah on the map, saying repeatedly and rather exci/tedly that those places were in the heart of the Hijaz, adding still more excitedly, that he could not possibly consent to the ‘Amir*Bin Baud or any one else capturing them or any part of the Kijaz* Ahmad Thaniyan rejoined, in a slightly irritated tone, that it was not the'imam'Bin Baud who had captured those places or any other place belonging to the Hijaz, but that it was only the usual inter-tribal fighting and capture by one Bedouin people against another which had been going on for ages and would go on as long as Badu existed in Arabia* This added to the King*s excitement, who, however, spoke with some restraint saying that it was no use denying facts: the Akhwan, who were none other than Bln Baud's forces, had attacked and taken the said villages as also they had taken Asslr, a dependency of the Hijaz* All those expeditions had, undoubtedly, been sent by Bin Baud for conquest and that was a direct offence and aggression against the Hijaz* Here, again, Ahmad Thaniyan showed irritation and said, only rather sharply, that His Majesty was concemed/with hie own territory the Hijaz and had nothing to do with Assir which was quite a separate district* What did it matter to the King if Bin Baud had made an attack on Assi^ although he did so as a necessary measure in defence of his own subjects wh*m Ibn 'Aayidh had been persecuting, so had to be punished* Bin Baud might, similarly^, be forced to take any other defensive measures against any of the in other chiefs in Arabia and would not A answerable to the King who was welcome to have his own territory the Hijaz proper* The© i- * X The king got excited ?tnd wa« going to epeak but Amir Abdullah interrened at tbi* juncture f aaying that perhape the * Amir # Ahmad Thaniyan meant to say that 1 might wat; right 1 and that Bin Baud being a great and powerful ruler, wa* free to do what he liked with hie weaker neighbours. In any case, the question requiring a solution wae how far the dispute between Nejd and Hija» wae real and substantial and how much of it was c f due to mieunderctanding or mieinterpretation of things. If that could be aecertained perhaps eome settlement might be arrived at that would eave any further trouble to both si dee. He, therefore, hoped that Hie Majesty would be pleaeed to raiow a full and free exchange of views to be had in friendly discussions between , Amir , Ahmad Thaniyan and those whom J!ia Majesty would appoint as his representatives in the presence of the British representative. The King ( who had recovered his temper ) calmly said that he himself was most anxious to arrive at a clear decision and was ready to welcome any settlement that would ensure rest and peace and prevent further bloodshed. Re did not want anything but the integrity of his own country the Hij az in which the districts of larabah, Khurmah, hi shah and Ranjah must, as of old, be included and these must be evacuated as also Kbha and Aesir. All these belonged to Hijaz - and had been aggiessively occupied by •Amir 1 Bin £&gt;&amp;ud and the Akhwan, and unlesa these were restored there could be no settlement or agreement. If any one present there could show that he himself had acted wrongly or onomically towards lin Baud or any other ruler, he would humbly adiiiit his own fault and would give sip wvey every thing ( abdicate ) rather than be a party to strife^ and bloodshed. The Amirs of Tarabah, Khurma,aMat Bishah and R&amp;njali had always been appointed and paid from &amp;€&gt;eca even us late as 1918 since when these places had. ■' cr.d been taken poeeesBlon of by Bln Baud. Ahmad Thanlyan was going to apeak, but Amir Abdullah again intervened saying His Majesty should allow hie servants Jro discuss matters fully with the Mission and submit result to him, whereupon^ the King said that he desired Amirs Ali and Abdullah with the Qaii-ul-^azat and Sharif Shakir to do so. ^adiq Pasha was also asked to witness the proceedings. We all departed from the King who stood up to shake hands with Ahmad Thaniyan, iarhan and myself saying that he would accept any thing decided upon by us for which we thanked His Majesty.2 0 U S * H — a B 2 T I S G . 1* This was immsdiately attended by all the above, via: Amirs All and Abdullah, the ^azi-ul-^azat and Sharif Shakir now formally repeeentln* the King, and Ahmad Thaniyan, myself wit, iurban and ,‘iadiq Pasha. As saon as we were seated in Amir All ' s room * Amir Abdullah delivered a sort of presedential or opening address in which he thanked H.h.M's Government for arranging to send the mission. Bin Baud for sending his able am ano enlightened cousin an his representative with a very friend, ly letter for King Husain. He then said that His Hashimite Majesty also deserved thanks of all for so kindly receiving the mission and for expressing hie keen and sincere desire to make a fUjendly settlement with his illustrious neighbour the Amir . ftJL re ndy of Nejd. Both the principal* had thus/giren a proof of their mutual goodwill and peaceful intention* toward* each other. ,Xt Vftt then the duty of the Nejd Mission and the HaBhimite Committee to try and find a final solution of the difficulties an&lt; to make a full and final ecttleraent in order that there might be no/cause for disagreement or dispute of any kind whatsoever, Ho real cause existed for any ill-will or enmity.

Beligious fanaeiticism should not be encouraged in Nejd or its evil consequences would be most deplorable to Arabia and Islam. Above all, no people outBide.Hejd proper should be proselytised as was being dome under the Akhwan movement. Free intercourse should be encouraged between Nejd and Jlija* as of old and the ruling families should strengthen their mutual firendehip and goodwill by means of intermarriage andand fre^usnt exchange of ri«ita etc:* 2* Ataad Tlianiyan, who seeded to rather depressed on hear!nr; t&gt;fc.is outburat of elO'|uerice # replied briefly* thankea the Amir Abdulluh for nil Vut t^aid about K• «{* f e OoTeroraent and the Inam Abdul Aziz who lov^d peace and trrm juility* a^id hoped, fc. itASU** * with the help of God,^ at a ftwenciXy tsettlement* Ke expressed his thankfulnepB for the kind reception, but regretted he had not been enpowered to settle any boundary question** but only to come and offer Bin Saud* a friendship and goodwill to Hie Majesty King Husain whom Bin Saud would one day personally meet to decide *uch boundary disputes as had unfortunately cropped up. 3* -\mir Abdullah wee evidently diseetiefied with this ae were alec his other colleguee who spoke a little, especially A the ^aai-ul-^azat and Sharif Shakir both of whim whispered together.

He hoped the Kajd Missions will not have come to Mecca in vain or was it that they had come only for the Hajj. 4. Amir Abdullah resumed saying that H.M*s Government had all along impressed upon King Husain that Bin Saud was ready and willing to compose the existing differnces and would pereonally meet the King in Uecca to do eo^but At the last moment they were told that the Mission was sent instead. The King had waited all the cinie and had welcomed the opportunity for a friendly settlement. Bin E&amp;ud had, on the other hand, been interfering with Amirs and tribesmen of the Hijaa not excluding Khalid, ^insman of theirs.

Badiq Kasha and ahaikh i’arhan aepke a little in supporlPIFTH MEETING • Ft 1. Thie wae of an informal or private nature• On receiving a note from AMIR ABDULLAH 1 went to the Qaer accompanied hy Farhan Al-Rahmah at 8 P.M# returning at 10 P on 30th August* 2. AMIR ABDULLAH eopke a great deal about Bin Baud’s actione and intentions in/ respect of the HIJAZ and KIHG HUSAIN, much in the strain as laready noted in detail in describing previous meetings. He also expressed his own doubts as to the gulf being successfully bridged. I confined myself to ordinary remarks, generally conveying a sense of hopefulnes* and encouragement for an agreement of peace, and allowed FARHAJ to say as little as possible by way of discussion. Finally I said that, as far as I could see, both sides had realised and regretted past mistakes and shown a spirit of reconciliation. IBN BAUD was more than willing to be on peace terms with KING HUSAIN who had himself expressed similar desire; so there was no use in wasting time over any / further discussion! which were neither necessary nor desirable* The best thing to do was to write the agreement and sign it in good faith relying upon Providence* AMIR ALI came in ( after we had been talking about half an hour ) with a big register. Both brothers were at great pains trying to show t); t their claim for KHURMA, T ARAB AH, BISHAH and MANJAH was rightful, and quite indisputable! one which KING HUSAIN would never give up or compromise etc: AMIR ALI said they possessed the strongest paxxiblE documentary evidence dne being that register itself* This regsiter was then shown me as being the record of salaries of the Turkish Civil Administration in HIJAZ. It ran from 1327-1331 and showed among others, the names with designations and monthly salaries of the Amirs of the above fourfour dietricte together with their Aeeietante end Clerke. The Amire «k were not eatiefled until I had examined it well and eaid that it seemed to me to he a clear record in itself. 4 . Eventually. I had to say that there was no point in trying to raise the boundary question again as that could not he settled or definitely dealt with hy the Hajd Mission. The preliminary agreement of peace and good-will was all that was possible and that was what had been agreed upon in that day's formal meeting. I relied upon their good sense and hoped the agreement would be completed or a good opportunity will have been thrown away and the Najd Mission will have returned without doing any good etc:. B . Both brothers then talked a little in nirkish. k l&gt; ABDULLAH turned to me and said lightly that he believe being a SUBBI and HAKAFI. like themselves, would not advocate BIH BAUD'S cause as he was a WAHABI Etc; I said 1 was a well- wisher and sympathiser of both sides as both were Muslims and mends of the Government I served and reprsented. After a few moment's talk in similar strain and EARHAH* s profuse express sione of our goodwill and sympathy for HIMG HUSAIH and his worthy sons, AMIR ABDULLAH took out a wto el eet of naper and showed me his draft agreement which he * 1 * *e **d -“ten out that afternoon for me to ma*e any additions or alterations I liked. H. would then hand it over to AMIR ALI ( who had just left u. saying he had. a headache ) for submitting it to the KING for approval* 6 . I criticised the draft as carefully as I could and with some difficulty persuaded him to make certain alterations and additions, notably.•* wrote ( lit.

His 'Hazra-al-Amir Ibn Baud' was altered to 'Saadat- al Imam Ibn Baud”* 1 pointed out that the word'Arair” was not appropriate for a ruler of Ibn Baud’s position. I knew he resented the uce of this word and often said that he had many 'Amirs' under him. I could not very well tell ABDULLAH that IBH BAUD called himself a 'MALIK' ( King ) and was sometimes styled 'SULTA5' by his own subjects, who, however, always on. spoke of and addressed him as 'IMAM' by far a suitable designati (3) . 'Aiye harakah min (^uwwah Hajdiyah Rasmiyah au ghair- rasmiyah' ( any hostile movement by a Najd force official, regular, or non-official, irregular )• This was changed to’any Hajd forces*. \ (4) . 'Tunsabilal-Akhwan' ( movements or raids by the A* Akhwan )• This was onshitted as superfluous: the distinction invidious .’Akhwan’ was only another name for ftajd Hha Vfahabis who were Included in th* term used in (3). ( 5 ) .'(^abla Hudhiye Khainsat ashur' ( ’final agreement m|jLst be concluded within five months’ ). This was changed to’as early as possible’. Ahmad Thaniyan had spoken in that day’s meeting and again told me thAt he would not sign anything speaking of Akhwan as apart from Najdis. All Najdis were Akhwan who would be bound by anything that bound Najdis, and thal no time limit was possible for him to fix without reference to | IBN BAUD, except perhaps the next Hajj season, though the prospective ewent of a final agreement might come off sooner. . /'-NSIXTH M'E K T I S G . % On Tuesday Slet August s 16th Zil Hajj Farhan and i myself went/ to the C^asr at 9 A.M. by appointment made the previous evening* Ahmad Thaniyan was found sitting alone in Amir* All’s room, which we passed and were ushered into Amir Abdullah’s room* After a few minutes Amir Abdullah came in and said that he had spoken to the XING about our previous evening’s discussion and also shown him the draft agreement* The KING has not approved of it and wanted to speak to us privately ( without Ahmad Thaniyan being present )• 2* We accordingly went with Amir Ali to the KING who was then bidding good-bye to some Egyptian Military Officers of the Mahmal* As soon as we were seated, the King, after a particularly cordial exchange greetings and enquiries after health, proceeded to say that he had been told by Ali about the previous evening’s ui private interview wd had^with his sons and about the agreement which I had suggested should be signed* He had already told us that he would aocept any settlement that would ensure peace, provided that it did not deprive him of his real rights. He sworw in the name of God that that was his real and full intention. He had waited two years with his hands tied by British Governments Xx Had we not been present with the MISSION, he would not have^one word with Ahmad Thaniyan or even Bin Baud if he had come in person As Government had sent us to Mecca, he would speak out what he had to say* He was surpirsed that Bin Baud had bee* been allowed to do all that he had done, although British Government could have stopped him by one word; . no force was needed. He himseli wae faithful and loyal to Government ever since he was advised^in the Nahdah* But if Government wanted to supplant him by Bin Baud or if could not or would not restrain Bin Baud, then they had better say so and he would willingly give up 'atanazil' ( abdicate ). He could no longer put up with the wrong / done him npd the bloodshed and looting carried on by BIN SAirD in the HIJAZ and ASSIR.ASBIR. Bln Baud'* forces must be withdrawn from TARABAH, KHURUAH, ASSIR and 8 UFAIBAH. and he must be confined to HaJ d Territory which was what hie father Ahdur Rahman, hie uncle Abdullah and hie grandfather Faieal originally pOBeeeeed. It was common knowledge that SX*ARA, HAF f AI SAIA with some other frontier Tillages were originally under' Mecca and giwcn as gift by SHARII MUHAMMAD BIH AUK to one of hie dependants Ibn Rubai*an. The Turkish Goremment records showed unmistakably that TARABAH, KHURMA, RANJAH and BIBHAH were H1JAZ districts* He had been patiently waiting to see these restored to him by Government* s orders* Bin Baud*s oharacter was too well-known: he had no faltl and could never be depended upon. He had just let loose his hung dogs of the Akhwan upon Ibn Sabah whose father had protected and sheltered Bin Saud when homeless refugee in Koweit running for life from Ibn Rashid. But as H.B.M*s Government had advised him to meet Bin Baud in person he had consented to do so, although - ' ^ it was most repugnant to his own mind. In deference to Govemmen wishes,he would himself go to any place at any time,if desired, for meeting Bin Saud under British auspices as he had no power qi» yfi gi) io oppose Great Britain and wus most, anxious to a ^ peace restored and bloodshed prevented. Yet Bla Sand Mad not soil its great friends and powerful rulers in Arabia at peace and had for that reason arranged the Mission which was then waiting upon His Majesty. As there had been unavoidable delay in exchanging comnunl cations,It had become impossible ** for Bin Saud n-self to come in time for the HaJJ.but the opportunity for a friendly settlement should not be lost and A propoaed preliminary agreement should be signed which would he an earnest of H.f Jb peacful and had broken his promise to Government. I said that Government was most anxious to see both intentions. Therefore, King Hussain suddenly wrose from his chair, flu pulled up hie sleave*and advancing to^nearest wall mads a 'Taya (the subsitute for 'wadhu' .ablutions preparatory to oruyer) m!num ,, and o■■■■ and then took up a Quran frora a table near by and ewore woet sole mnly,holding the Quran in hie left hand and placing hie right • hand on to the Holy Book,Baying ' God knows I sincerely desire peace. If British Government finds me in fault or refractory let them say so and I will at once abdicate. If Government continues to let Bin faud do what he has been doing so far without punishing him,I will raeign, Sod is my witness '.Then putting down the Quran on the table,he advanced towards us and kissed my turhan ana then kissed Farhan on the forehead, saying ' .ddhd ih'Jiyd ibni ( this is all I have to say,Son.) Then,to Farhan ' you are a- Arahflike my.elf and faithful to Great Britain as I am myself. e&lt; A u thie looked very dramatic and we stood from be'.ining to end without knowing what to say. The King then sat down and w. followed suit. He was very much moved and looked as if he was about to shed tears. He went on to say that everything was in Government's hand. Th.y could stop and punish Bin Baud in one day, if they liked to do so. He then said 1 should telegraph to Govern- ment what he had said that day. The Mls.ion must/ make a full and final settlement of all outstanding questions and the first con dition of agreement must be immediate withdrawal of Bin Eaud's forces from TAR AB AH,KHUR1IA, BUFKH AH and ASBIR.

Amir All and ftaxt-ul-Ciuxat spoke a little and latter Bai 4 pointedly that the whole thing came td ngthing more than a temporary respite or truce during the present UaJJ.

O0O to On the morning of 1st September, I went ■* A»ir Abdullah office and after a brief diecueeion and beating about the bush, Amir Abdullah re-wrote the former draft agreement as altered by me. Hie only remarks worth nothing were (1) that while King Hueeain was extremely desirous of a final settles ment being made within a few months,if not on that very ocoaeior both Ahmad Thanaiyan and myself were going to put it off in definitely. That was due either to Bin Saud # s own intention to gain time or perhaps Government would for some reason give him more rope. To this I replied that it was only due to the limit ed authority of the Nejd Mission which was not competent to settle the broad questions of boundaries etc. (#) that King Husrain was only independent sovereign an^ hie Government the only Government In Arabia reoognlaad a- euoh by the Foreign Power* (That being The case,Bin Saud who was always styled •Amir Hejd*,could not fitly the referred to in the proposed agreement as 'Ruler* or 'GovernmentHe had nothing li. e a Government,but was everything himself, nth some reasoning Abdullah gave up the contention and wrote 'Ruler of Hejd' and •His Excellency Imam Ibn Baud'. The rest of the work consisted of merely copying the former draft which was finished b.fore all the others joined us. The draft wae then read over and,after very few remarhs by Ahmad Thanaiyan and the others.passed as acceptable to ai:. A|ilr All then took it to King Hussain who present! invited all the members to see him. As soon a. all were seated,the King,who appeared to be very 11 disappointed and irritated, said that h. had been given to understand that the Hejd Mission did not want to do more than undertake that there would be no more advance or encroa.hm.nt upon the Hijas till all the matter- in dispute oouldcould bo settled at » ome unknomi future time. He was quite unable to agree to that as he had waited lon£ to see his wrongs redressed. The Mission had cdne to the holy town, performed the pilgrimege and was welcome to stay as long as it suited the members who were his brdth€jtv and honoured guests f but no paper could be signed by way of an agreement unless it oortoired as the first condition the immediate evacuation of the occupied Hijaz districts. The respected Amir, agent of Bin Baud, could take that as the last word the king had to say and the British representative could oommunioate the same to his Government. If Great Britain wanted to see the Hijaz shorn of its frontier districts, he had only one course open to him he would resign and let Bin Baud be made King of the Hijaz as he was so powerful, * had a high p.digre. and poBBOBaed groat ahllitl.. .to. Ahmad Thanaiyan r.pli.d that sin Sand -i ■ ot and would not occupy any of th. Hijaz territory which wao Hie Majesty's own and would aver un* r.main hie. Bin Baud had oft.n declared that In hi. l.tt.r. to the King and to H.B.M's Government and admitted that nis wwn religious beliefs prevented hie ever thinking of taking over th. administration of the Hijaz. A. he had already explained . he was powerleee to sign any paper dealing with any of th. disputed place and it only remained for him to take .aa-re of the King and return to Riyadh which he *a* *l»h compell ed to do owing to hie own ill-health in Mecca. # The ftazi-al-ftuzat spoke eaying it wae unreaeonabl to allow that opportunity pass without making a settlement and it wae for the British representative to ... that it were done.

Hijaz as it had been since the tinsy If V.. 1 % time of his uncle and Bin Saud^. grandfather Faidal. 7. After &amp; few renarks of the kind already stated, Ahmad Thanaiyan arose and took leave of the King and Farhan and mysolf foilowed,returning to Amir Abdullah’s room* Abdullah oame back shortly afterward® and said that toi after wo had departed he and his ool leagues of the Hashi- mite Committee had begged the King ^fco give his consent to 8 s the preliminary agreement,but they could not move His Majesty iy 1 wh 6 wae going to write to ue what he had verbal declared that morning. It was very difficult to persuade the King as he was feeling very much aggrieved and disappointed. 9 . Tfe left with a request to Abdullah to push the matter through if possible,or arrange for the early return of the Nejd Mission as there was nothing else to be done and members had been suffering from ill-health ever since their f arrival in Mecca. # The same evening I received a note from Amir Ali reminding me to concruricate to Government Ahwad Thanaiyan ’q | refusal conclude a satisfactory agreement and the King’s 4 answer of that rooming.

On 4th September Ahnad Thanaiyan and myself went to the Qasr accompanied by B’arhan and found Amir Abdullah, the Qazi-al-Quzat and Fharif Shakir present. Amir All was absent and stated to be indisposed. Abdullah spoke a little sayingthe object of the Nejd Mission had been attained and u the King had given his consent^the agreement being signed in the hope that it would be beginning of a final settlement and lasting peace as both sided had had an opportunity of explaining their reepectlve^olalms and right, in the presence of an officer of H.B.M.’s Government and had gained mutual confidenceconfidence,etc* He added?that the worde 'Imam* and 'Hakitf' had been objected to fav they had never been used before in any official paper in the HIJaa but In deference to Ahmad Tft&amp;naiyan’e wiehec the Eashimite Ocrnmittee would let these remain* Ahrad Thanciyan. nr&gt;d rye el f thanked Amir Abdullah and the Committee.
