The question of final ex-gratia payments was raised to which mminco representatives replied that they had reached the limit of their bid. Aminco stated that it was most unlixely that any other company would bid higher. The Saudis remained firm. 2.

Your telegram Mr. Hartley Stevens of iiMINCO called at Foreign Office on January 17th to complain of improper intervention by Political Agent Kuwait, yourself and H.M. Consul at Basrah to restrain Shaikh from permitting Company to explore for oil on three islands. Stevens case is that at the time of granting Neutral Zone concession both the Shaikh and Oil company understood that three islands were included in terms of concession and he has produced copies of affidavits signed by members of Company to this effect. Copies of affidavits which state that Shaikh clearly expressed above intention in interviews with Company’s officials are being sent to you. 2. It was pointed out to Stevens that his contention that islands are included in Neutral Zone concession/—concession did not seem correct and that even if local rounds at Kuwait considered islands were included in concession it had been made clear to Company representatives in London that no islands appertained to Neutral Zone and concession had been approved on that understanding. If islands do not appertain to Neutral Zone then apparently they appertain to Kuwait proper and prima facie Kuwait Oil Company may claim that islands are included in area of their concession. That Company in fact do so claim. Political iigent was therefore entitled to warn Shaikh that he mi^ht be offering rights to iJvlINCO which he had already granted to Kuwait Oil Company. Furthermore, if Shaikh’s case is that he considers islands covered by Neutral Zone concession he is makin^ an admission which may give Ibn Saud or Ibn Saud's concession company right to claim share in islands. This is a matter concerning Shaikh’s foreign relations possibly involving risk of alienation of territory in which we are directly concerned. On these grounds suggestion of improper interference was repudiated. 3. Regarding affidavits Stevens was informed that it would be necessary to compare his account with version of Shaikh. It was suggested since two concessions provide for differences arising between ohaikh and Companies over interpretation thereof to be settled by mutual agreement or if necessary by arbitration, it would now/now be for latter to clear up their differences with bhaikh who should decide between them in consultation with us as far as concerns political aspects and his A possible liabilities should his decision be upset as a result of either party seeking arbitration. 4. You should inform dhaikh without delay of Oil Company's allegations and seek his comments ensuring that he fully appreciates danger of attitude he may have taken regarding islands. b. Before sending btevens to London iiMINCC sought support of dtate Department who instructed United States Embassy here to sponsor Stevens expressing hope that political pressure had not been applied vis a vis commercial interests of a British firm (viz K.O.C.) U.S. Embassy have been informed that action taken was purely for political reasons. 6. Kuwait Oil Company have said that they definitely claim islands to be inculded in their concession that their American Directors are representing their claim to State Department and that an .American Director in this country is approaching U.S. Embassy here to speak to us on their behalf.

He mentioned that he had certain letters from AMINCO representatives and these I gathered he considered to carry weight agginst the allegations. He did not volunteer details and I, therefore, did not press him. He did, however, de^nitely refer to Raynor's letter vide my telegram 0/26 dated November 3rd in support of his statement. Shaikh asked the rhetorical question how islands 27 miles from the shore could be considered to be in the Neutral Zone concession. 3. He asked me if any member of the Oompany had definitely stated that fche had named the islands in question as appertaining to their concession adding that he had/*--he had not done so. I replied that I believed that they had, but had not seen their written statements. 4. I told bhaikh that he mi^ht have to give a decision in consultation v/ith His Majesty’s Cfovernment and that there might be a resort to arbitration.

I shall be grateful to Know if any advance has been made in the appointment of the Chief Local Representative for Aminco. fhe SheiAh’s Representative of the Company writes on Kuwait Government not e-pa oer asKing for visas for Kuwait for employees of the Company. This shows that they are still sending out employees from the 3tates to Kuwait, and does not presage any immediate departure from Kuwait in spite of the fact that the Company have no territory in which to operate. Also there is a considerable amount of talK about the oheiKh’s having granted them a piece of land on which to build offices and staff quarters on the spare land outside the boundary fence of Dasman. The dheiKh informs me that he has agreed to no such site, though I cannot be certain that this is a fully accurate statement. 3. I venture to proohesy, on the basis of the SheiKh’s present attitude towards co-operation between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Agency, that after the appointment of a Chief Local Representative we should find it hard indeed to make the Company conform to the Agreement. Whether or not we should endeavour to is not of immediate importance, what I require is an officially appointed person with whom I can deal in case of need and who by Agreement is bound to wotk through me in certain matters.

This understanding was confirmed cn various later occasions when the matter arose, both before and after signature of the contract* On Monday, November 8, 1948 at the same Dasraan Palace, I was personally informed by His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait that the three islands of Kubr, ;iaru and Umra al Maradim were a part of the American Independent Oil Company Concession which His Highness had signed on June 28, 1948* On Friday, November 19, 1948, I was present at an interview with High Highness with Mr. Charles B. Rayner, Vice President of the American Independent Oil Company, at which interview His Highness, when informed that our boat, the Badawy, was to arrive shortly in Kuwait Harbor, stated to Mr. Rayner that He felt the logical place for this boat to begin operations was the islands of Kubr, Qaru and Umra al Maridim. His Highness further stated that these three Islands were His solely, and that they were included in our concession. His Highness stated He would so advise the British political Agent in Kuwait. On Sunday, November 28, 1948, in an interview with His Highness with Mr. Rayner, at which the undersigned was present, His Highness informed Mr. Rayner that He had advised the British Political Agent in Kuwait that He had authorised American Independent Oil Company to start work on these islands which were included in the American Oil Company concession and which were under His sole soverign ty. In addition to the foregoing I would like to state furthers I have been associated with negotiations on behalf of the American independent il Company, and have visited Kuwait in the course of these negotiations during the following periods: November 7* 1947 to November 13* 1947* March 4* 1948 to March 8,1948; May 25,1948 to June 30th.l948; October 14, 1948 to October 17*1948; November 7th, 1948 to November 8, 1948; and November 19th, 1948 to Noveoiber 28, 1948.

(Sgd) Harley Ster nsCOPY f^\ On this 8th day of January 1949# there appeared before me Charles B.Rayner# Vice president of the American Independent Oil Company, resident in Washington, D«C. , who having been duly sworn deposes and says: On the evening of Friday, November 19#1946 at the Dasman Palace, City of Kuwait, Sheikhdom of Kuwait, Persian Gulf, where I was then staying as the guest of Els Highness, Sheikh Salim al Jabr al subah, the Ruler of Kuwait, I was visited by His Highness who was accompanied by his Secretary and Aide de Camp, &amp;zzat Gaafar* I reported to His Highness on our negotiations with the Government of Saudi Arabia concerning a concession for the Saudi right, title and Interest in the Kuwait-3audi Arab Neutral Zone and then discussed with His Highness matters relating to the concession he had granted to American Independent Oil Company on June 28th, 1946. In the course of this conversation I mentioned I had Just reweived word that our boat, the Badawy, with a geological and geophysical party aboard, was due to arrive in Kuwait Harbor very shortly* His Highness felt that the logical place for this party to start operations would be the Islands included in our concession, specifically mentioning Caru, Kubr and Uram al Maradim, since these islands were under His sole sovereignty# work on these islands could not in any way jeopardize the delicate negotiations then going on with Saudi Arabia* All during this conversation His Highless left no doubt that he regarded the islands above mentioned as included in our concession and before leaving he again referred to this matter, reiterated that these Islands were included in the area covered by our concession contract and expressed the hope that our work there would start very soon.

Brooke of Breckenridge, Texes, now in Fort Worth, Texas, who upon being sworn states on oath as fallows: I have been engaged in the oil business for twenty years. During World War II I became acquainted with Eszat Mohharaed Caafar, the aide-de-camp of Hia Highness Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah. The ?uler of Kuwait, Persian Gulfj and later became acquainted with His Highness, The Ruler. This acquaintance developed into a very close personal friendship. ^ Through this friendship and my knowledge of the oil business, che matter of oil concessions was discussed many times by His Highness, The Ruler and me. As a result of these diocupsions I introduced in July 1947 representatives of American Independent Oil Company to His Highness, The Ruler, and this introduction resulted in the successful conclusion of negotiations for an oil concession. * In June 1948 Just prior to the final signing of the oil concession. His Highness, The Ruler, stated that if American Independent Oil Company was the successful bidder for the concession, the islands would be a part of the concession. On Wednesday, November 24, 1948, the affiant arrived in Kuwait, Persian Gulf and was granted an audience by His Highness, The Ruler, -In the course of our discussions. His Highness, The Ruler, told me that Je had officially notified the Political Agent that it was His intention to specifically include the islands of Kubr.Qaru ana Umm al Meradim in the concession granted the American Independent Oil company on June 28, 1948. He told me to inform American Independent Oil Company of His action and that as soon as He received a reply from the British Government He would write an official letter to the American Independent Oil Company that American Independent Oil Company could start work on these islands. On December 18, 1948 His Highness, The Ruler, called me to Dasmen Palace, Kuweit, Persian Gulf, and told me to go back to the United States and Inform American Independent Oil Company that it was and always had been His intention to include these three Islands in the American Independent Oil Company Concession,and the only delay was caused by awaiting a reply from the British Foreign Office. His Highness. The Ruler, indicated that He expected very little difficulty in securing the approval of the British Government. In my many visits to Kuwait and His Highness, The Ruler, on behalf of the American Independent Oil Company, His Highness, The Ruler, has always designated Ezzat tlohatmed Gaafar as His Official spokesman in these negotiations. All statements made to me by Ezzat Mohammed Gaafar pertaining to these negotiations have been later confirmed by His Highness, The Ruler, or actual happenings. Ezzat Mohammed Gaafar was assigned to talk with me on my last visit to Kuwait, which was during the period of November 24, 1948 to December 16, 1948. I was informed on December 14. 15, and 16, 1948 by the aforementioned Ezsat Mohammed Gaafar that the British Political Agent had made a personal request to His Highness, The Ruler, to grant thethree Islands named above to the Kuwait Oil Company and to make them a part of the Kuwait Oil Company conoeesion. I was also informed by Ezzat Ifohamrted Gaafer that the British Politioal esident from Bahrein Island came to Kuwait and made another request of His Highness, The Ruler f to include these three islands in the Kuwait Oil Company Concession. I was also informed by Ezzat Jfohammed Gaafar that the British Consul from Basra made a trip to Kuwait and unofriclalJy requested that His Hlghnet s, The Ruler, include these three islands in the Kuwait Oil Company concession. His Highness The Ruler informed me that he had refused all of these personal ' requests by various representatives of the British Government. I have visited Kis Highness, The Ruler many times in the past two years, and can ciefinitely state that whenever the subject of islands arose. His Highness, The Ruler, never changed His position, buo has ratified and confirmed to the undersigned that the islands were to be a part of any concession granted American Independent til company. He made these statements both before and after the official signing of the concession on June 28, 1948. (Signed) James B. Brooks. THE STATE OP TEXAS COUNTY OP TARRANT Subscribed and sworn to before me, A Notary public in and for Tarrant County, Texas, on this the 15 th day of January, A.D. 1949. ginned: atells Sohoremover Notary Public, Tarrant county, Texas. sealRECORD OF ii MWim , Notes of a Meeting held on 15th January at which Mr* Hartley Stevens of the American Independent Oil Company called to state his position regarding hie Company’s concession in the Kuwait Neutral Zone* urf^kittall. Ministry of Fuel and Power* Mr* Stewart 9 Eastern Department* Mr* Evans 9 Legal Adviser* Mr* Rogers 9 Eastern Department. Mr* Stevens was asked to state his position which he did in some detail 9 the burden of his criticism of British action being thatr (a) We were trying to interpret the terms of his Company’s concession with the Sheikh which we had no locus atanqj to do and (b) That we were putting pressure on the Sheikh to favour the interests of a British company when the Sheikh had expressed himself as willing to enter into certain arrangements with Mr* Steven’s Company, as a result of their common understanding of the terms of the concession* Mr* Stevens said that both the Sheikh and his Company considered that the three islands in issue were intended to be included in the concession which was signed in June of last year* This intention was not only on the Company’s side but on the Sheikh's and he could produce aifidavits to show that this was so* Mr* Stev e ns said that the Sheikh considered that the islands were not in the Kuwait Oil Company’s concession area but were in the area of Mr* Stevens’ Company* When aakod how the three islands could be considered to be in a concession area which was confined to the Neutral Zone, (which, under the terms of the agreement between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kuwait, was a land area with no islands mentioned), and X&gt;articularly when the three islands were known indubitably to belong to the Sheikh of Kuwait (which would apparently imply that they belonged to the territory of Kuwait proper), Mr. Stevens developed a theory that the islands belonged ’’geologically and morphologically', as he put it, 'to the land mass of which they were so a part, i*e* the Neutral Zone'* (As a matter of fact, of course, only two of the islands, Qaru and Unim-al-Maradhin, could be considered as seaward extensions of the land since Kubbar is off Kuwait proper.) Mr* Stevens was asked specifically whether he intended to suggest that the islands were in teriitorial waters* To this he gave no definite answer but suggested that his Company consideiHsd that the islands, in what he considered to be the correct present-day geological phrase, 'related' to the land mass of which they were a part and therefore they must be considered to be part of the area for which the Sheikh had granted them a concession. Mr* Stevens replied to Mr* Nuttall and Mr* Stewart (who had reminded him that they had clearly pointed out to him at the time the coneession was signed that no islands could be considered to belong to the Neutral Zona) that that may have been, and might be, our opinion, but that the negotiators on the spot and the Sheikh had nevertheless intended that the islands should be included in the conce sion area* Consequently, while we might hold our opinions on the merits of the matters In dispute, we should not interfere to put pressure on the Sheikh in a matter on which he had definite ideas contrary to our own and when his ideas coincided with that of the Company* As regards the pressure which the Company considered we had applied, he said he had affidavits to show that 'a procession of people' among which he suggested were the Political Agent, Kuwait, the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and the Consul at Basra (or Bagdad, Mr* Stevens was not sure which) had visited the Sheikh to press our p int of view upon him* The Sheikh also had said that pressure was being put upon him* /WhileWhile not much was said in detail In reply to Stevens’ allegations 9 since it was thought best to defer a full statement of our position until we had fully examined that of Mr. Stevens, the points were made to him that we did not consider that we had put pressure on the Sheikh, nor that we were in the position of having gratuitously attempted to interpret the Company's concession when we had no standing to do so. It was briefly pointed out to Mr« Stevens that, for one thing, we had not before his visit heard a full statement of his case, and, for another, his interpretation of tho concession as regards the area to which it applied might be said to be based upon a somewhat strained interpretation of many points in issue, and that in view of our special position in Kuwait we could hardly do otherwise than point out to the Sheikh some of the difficultiee of the position in which he appeared to be placing himself without realising what was at stake. It was also pointed out to him that the Kuwait Oil Company was a 50/* American owned Company so that it could not be urged in any case that our action, even if interpreted as pressure, was being exercised in favour of British interests exclusively. Mr. Stevens maintained that though he admitted our right to advise the Sheikh*we had gone beyond what we were entitled to do and that he hoped we would agree to withdraw px’eesure. He said that the iitate Department were behind him in tnie matter and that they intended to see that pressure was withdrawn* He was told that we would now consider fully our position in the light of the Company's case and give him a reply as soon as possible.sm- ^.S 968/153V91) SECRET .

(E 965/1554/91) U (9 Claim of American Independent Oil Company to the Island of Qaru, Kubbar and Umm Al Klaradhln* ——OQO— we have had a conplelnt from the American Independent Oil Conpany, mildly supported by the U.S. Embassy, of the mis use of political powers in the Persian Gulf in support of a British commercial interest. we have refuted this claim, to the satisfaction as we hope of at least the U.3. Embassy. 2. The conplalnt turns upon the Company's efforts to obtain the permission of the Sheikh of Kuwait to explore for oil on the three islands of Qaru, Kubbar, and* Umm al tfaradhln, which lie well out in the Gulf east and south east of Kuwait. Our first indication that AMINCO were intonating themselves in these islands was Kuwait telegram No. 41 of (£15110). 23rd November. This reported that the Sheikh had called upon the Political Agent and shown him a letter received from a representative of the company which is reproduced in the above telegram. The letter purports to confirm an understanding reached between the Corrpany (who have a concession covering the Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) and the Sheikh that the three islands which are considered to be those referred to in their Concession of 28th June, 1948, are 'wholly owned by Your HighnessU The Political Agent repofced that as there seemed no doubt that the islands belong to Kuwait proper and not to the Neutral zone they were presumably in the area covered by the Kuwait Oil Conpany Concession. Foreign Office telegram No. 307 of 27th November replied to Kuwait that the Sheikh appeared to have involved himself in discussions concerning rights which he had already granted to the Kuwait Oil Company and the Sheikh should be advised accordingly. The Political Resident in his telegram No. 16 of 29th November also supported the views expressed by Political Agent, Kuwait, and concurred in by the Foreign Office, that the islands belonged to Kuwait proper and were covered by the concession of the Kuwait Oil Company. 3. The Political Agent then reported on 11th Decent)er that after discussions with the Sheikh, the latter had stated that the islands were not included in the AMINCO Concession and that the AMINCO representative was being so informed; but that the islands were also not included in the Kuwait Oil Company Concession. 4. There were no further developments until a few days agoj when the U.S. Embassy showed us a State Department tele gram reporting that AMINCO representatives had compfained to the Department that inproper pressure was being put on the Sheikh at Kuwait by the British auhhorltles in an attempt to make him discriminate against AMINCO. Mr. Hardey Stevens, the AMINCO representative, arrived in London and called at the Foreign Office on 15th January to present the Con^any's case. The Assistant Legal Adviser and a representative of the Ministry of Fuel and Power were present. A record of the meeting is shown at Flag A • 5. In brief, the Corrpany's case was that, at the time of concluding the Neutral Zone Concession, both the Sheikh and the Oil Coriqpany understood the three islands to be included in the terms of the Concession and to support this Mr. Stevens / produced6} ,4V produced copies of affidavits signed by Conpany officials who had had conversations with the aheifch. A copy of the agreed brief upon the basis of which a verbal reply was given to Mr# Stevens is shown at Flag B# r jChe reply was» briefly, that no Islands belonged to the Neutral zone and that therefore the Islands appertain to Kuwait proper, in which case the Kuwait Oil Conqpany might be entitled to claim (and in fact did claim) that the Islands were covered by their Concession. If the Sheikh had agreed that the Islands were Included in the Neutral Zone Concession he appeared to have mode an admission which might enable Ibn Baud or Ibn Baud’s concessionaire Con^any, to claim an Interest in the Islands# Such an admission would definitely give us a locus standi to warn the sheikh of its dangers, particularly as our approval of the concession was given after our view had been made clear to the Company's representative in London that no islands appertained to the Neutral Zone# (The basis of our position in this matter is our reaponsibility for the forei ;n affairs of the Sheikh together with the agreement signed by the Sheikh in 1899 binding him and his auccessors not to alienate any part of his territory without the consent of the British Government). It was therefore pointed out to Mr. Stevens that we could not admit that we had a&amp;erclsed improper pressure# We had interfered no more than our duties to the Sheikh demanded. Mr. Lewis Jobes of the United States Embassy was also informed of the reply given to Mr# Stevens. 6# It is now proposed to inform the Political Resident, Bahrein, and the Political Agent, Kuwait, of the present position as in the draft telegram# (Signed) T. £• ROGERS ^n&amp;__ 0 anuary, 1949 ./ SECRET. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 3rd February, 1949 (52/10/49) | f ^ Djned S-l CU\ J'/;&gt;KS’Z /A.L Kuuau Receipt &amp; - Vvill you please let me have, your comments in the enclosures-tcT Eastern Department's letter E966/1534/91 of 27th January, as soon as possible?.r^ ' KUWAIT. 10th February, 1949. &gt; Will you please refer to your letter No.52/10/49 dated 3rd February, 1949? I find it difficult to comriient on the affidavits, for the statements which refer to me are concerned with reported speech. I can refute the statement that Consul, Basra (or Baghdad) spoke personally to the Sheikh, and that the Sheikh gave me official intimation. I did not ask the SheiKh to give the islands to the Kuwait Oil Com pany. I am in no position to say if the conversations did take place, but I see no reason why they should not have done so. Nothing said in the affidavits alters the fact that the islands are not included in the wording of the Concession; nor do I see how they can possibly be, especially if the wording of the affidavits is followed. These refer to the 3heikh T s ’sole* sovereignty whereas the Neutral Zone Concession refers to divided territory. Had they been included in the Concession a special men tion must have been made, if only to exclude”them from the Saudi Arabian half. ' 2. I think the Sheikh’s present wish is to allow Aminco to operate on the islands claiming them as his personal pro ;erty, which would account for his denying them to the Kuwait Oil Company. I doubt very much if he would be able to maintain this attitude if it were seriously challenged, since he must abide by his claim of 1923 when it was officially agreed between him and H.M.G. that the islands appertain to Kuweit. They are not, of course, his ’sole* property. 3. One thing stands out in my mind and that is even ‘supposing Aminco did evince particular regard for the islands at least they had not the courage to make men tion of them on paper until after the failure of their negotiations with Saudi Arabia. The fact that Saudi Arabia had put an estoppel on their working in the Neutral Zone without the King’s permission must have been known to them before they left to negotiate in Saudi Arabia.

AMINCO a at an early stage to drop their coatention that three islands were part of their Neutral Zone concession. Discussions have since turned almost entirely on the question whether we could and should oppose grant of a new concession by SheiKh to any Company for islands before adjudication of KOC’s claim that they are already iacluded in their concession. AMINCO represented strongly that it was for Sheikh to decide whether he wished to give a new concession irrespective of possible prior claims. KOC represented that we ought to use our recommendations with the oheiKh to dissuade him from doing so until their pledge had been properly settled, either by friendly discussion or arbitration. United States Embassy approached us on instructions from State Department who strongly bacited AMINCO f s position and suggested that we should be discriminating in favour of a British Company if we intervened to prevent Sheikh giving any other Company a new concession for islands if he wished to do so. We have now reached/-2 &gt; I ^ reached position summarised in following paras on which you should tatce action. Copies of records of conversation and other documents are being sent by bag. 2. KEMP, whar on behalf of Sheikh has replied to KOC’s letter referred to in para 5 of my telegram under reference to the effect that he does not regard himself as having given a concession for islands either to KOC or to AMINCO. KOC have replied in this connection stating their claims and are now seeking legal advice on method of pursuing it.- Our view is that in the light of this belief of Sheikh he should freely, subject to proviso noted below, give a new concession for islands if he so wishes to any companies, including KOC and AMINCO. Proviso is that he should warn companies once again that these islands are subject to a claim by KOC and that he would be running into serious danger if he gave a new concession without safeguarding himself from possible prior claims. He could do this in one of three ways which hB would be free to choose. a) He could refuse to give a new concession until KOC claim had been settled. b) He could give a concession at once but containing provision that it would not become operative until KOC’s claim had been settled or until after a fixed time limit before which claim would have been settled, c) He could give a concession which would include a clause to the effect that it IK ’ ^ was subject to KOC 's claim being/valid and that if claim was proved valid, new concession would lapse and Shaikh would be indemnified for any prejudice which he might have incurred by giving concession. 3. If/—3 3. If Sheikh chose alternative (a) there would be nothing to prevent him meanwhile giving letter of intention to any Company he wished to the effect that he intended to enter into negotiations for a concession with them as soon as KOC’s claim had been adjudicated. If he chose alternative (b) or (c) there would have to be a political agreement between His Majesty's Government and Company which obtained the concession of same kind as for Neutral Zone, and Political Agreement would refer to condition included in concession. A suitable form of words for condition to be included in a concession on^Lines (c) above is given in my immediately following telegram.r been 4. We have/strongly pressed by AMINCO to say whether we would refuse to allow Sheikh to grant a con cession in any other form. We have made it clear in reply that we would approve of any arrangement following any one of the alternatives set out above and that we hoped the matter would be settled in a friendly spirit on the basis of ane of these possibilities. We did not wish to talK in terms of a prohibition or of categorical orders to Sheikh which would not correspond to our relations with him or to relations we wished to have with Oil Companies. 5. It should also be made clear to Sheikh that if he decided to give a new concession for islands, subject to one of the conditions mentioned above, it is open to him at his choice either to give it to a particular company or to put it up to auction. We would not influence his choice on that point. 6. We have consistently emphasised a) that it is for Sheikh to decide whether he wishes to give a new concessioa for islands and if so to what Qompany4 6 ?) a»d by what method he decides om merely setting out for him courses which seem possible ia the light of aecessity for safeguarding his own position and possible prior claims b) that we are entirely impartial as between British and American Companies. It is a cardinal point in our position in the Persian Gulf that we should not use our political influence to discriminate in favour of British Commercial interests. ?• Both 4MINC0 and KOC have been tnld that we are giving advice on above lines to Sheikh. You. should now arrange that our attitude be made known to him urgently on lines of paragraphs two and six above. 8 . AMINCO have particularly asked us whether we would use our influence both with Sheikh and KOC particularly if* alternatives (a) or (b) in paragraph two above are chosen to expedite consideration of KOC’s claim. We have said that we would certainly use our influence in this direction if necessary. It appears that KOC after a slow start are dealing with this matter expeditiously. We may have to asic you to try to influence the Sheitch in the same direction if this proves necessary. 9 « ^or your own information we understand privately from KEMP that it is probably Sheikh’s intention to auction three islands at the same time as Continental Shelf of Neutral Zone. We are not at all sure that this is, a wise course. It would in any case be essential that even if Continental Shelf and three islands were auctioned together, they should be covered by separate concessions even if these were granted to same company in order to show clearly islands are not part of Neutral Zone. It will *o doubt/5 mo doubt be necessary to maice this clear to oheiich at some stage but you should ta*ce no action on this point for the present, as we do not wish Kemp to feel that we are abusing his confidence. 10. Captain T.C. Conwell and Mr. T.H. Holland of AMINCO are flying to Kuwait as quickly as possible and may be there by Thursday March 3rd. You should maKe sure that 3hei^h is aware of attitude before he has any dealings with them. 11. AMINCO have text of clause in my immediately following telegram. I leave it to you to decide at what stage to communicate this text to Sheikh. If he decides not to grant concession for the present it may not be necesaary to do so at all. You should in any case maxe it clear that we are not trying to draw up a concession for him but merely felt? it desirable to set out clearly what we thought necessary to safeguard his own interest. 12. Please report action taken and any further developments. = SECRETARY OF STATE FOP FOREIGN AFFAIRS =Telegram O.T.P From Prodrome, London. Prodrome, Bahraia Tel. No. 101.

Morris speaks of a 'monument” i.e. iron stake which he says was erected by KOC in early days to delimit the extent of their area in the Gurain region. This is perhaps worth keeping in mind during consideration of frontier’s alignment, and possibly might be checked in London.

Tours faithfully. Tor KUWAIT OIL OOEPAHT LIMITED, C. A. P. Southwell, Managing Director.THE KUWAIT OIL COMPANY OPINION by PROFESSOR H. LAUTERPACHT, K.C. , # LL.D. ; one of His Jiiajesty’s Counsel; Whewell Professor of International Lav/ in the University of Cambridge; of Gray's Inn, Barrister at Law; Fellow of the British Academy; Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; Associate of the Institute of International Law, I THE LAE APPLICABLE I am asked to give an opinion on the question whether the concession granted on 23rd December 193A- to the Kuwait Oil Company includes the Qaru and some other islands not appearing on the map attached to the concession. The relevant Article 1 of the Agreement provides as fellows: 'The Shaikh hereby grants to the Company the exclusive right to explore search drill for produce and win natural gas asphalt ozokerite crude petroleum and their products and cognate substances (hereinafter referred to as 'petroleum') within the Sta t e of Kuwait including all islands and territorial wate r s appertaining to Kuwait as shown generally on the map annexed hereto , the exclusive ownership of all petroleum produced and won by the Conpany within the State of Kuwait the right to refine transport sell for use within the State of Kuwait or for export and export or otherv/ise deal with or dispose of any and all such petroleum and the -^ight to do all things necessary for the purposes of IhoseI / ^ operations. The Company undertakes however that it will not carry on any of its operations within areas occupied by or devoted to the purposes of mosques sacred build‘^qs or graveyards or carry on any of its operations except the sale of petroleum housing of staff and employees and administrative work within the present town wall of Kuwait. The period of this Agreement shall be 75 years from the date of signature.' Unlike the parallel Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government the Agreement with the Shaikh contains no reference to the Arbitration Act of 1889j it has no provision as to what law shall govern its construction. Article 18 lays down that in default of agreement by the parties the place of arbitration shall be in London, It also provides that in case of disagreement between the arbitrators as to the choice of the referee the latter shall be appointed by the British Political ^^sident in the Persian Gulf. While it is impossible to express a positive opinion as to what a court might hold on cons''oration of the Agreement as a whole, these provisions in themselves, so far as they go, seem to point towards English law, rather than any other law, as the proper law of the contract. Thus it was held in Norske Atlas Insurance Company Ltd , v. London Ge neral Insurance Co.Ltd , that other things being equal the lav/ applied by the arbitrators is to be the law of the country in which the arbitration is held: (1927) Times Law Repo rts, 541. There are other English cases in which the courts assumed, from circumstantial evidence, that English law is the law of the contract as was the case in Hamlyn v. Telisker Distillery A.C.202, where the aontract, made in Prance by a French firm for the sale of goods to a firm in Scotland, provided that 'should any dispute arise out of this contract the same to be 2.(&gt; cz settled by arbitration by two members cf the London Corn Exchange, «r their umpire, in the usual way' and where it was held that English law was the proper law of the contract; or in Spurrier v. La Cloche /l9027 A.C. 1+1+6, a oase of a contract made in Jersey, in which the fact that the contract referred to the English Arbitration Amt was regarded as relevant; or in The N.1eg»s P.90, where a French firm chartered a Yugoslav ship for the carriage of grain from Argentine to Sweden and where the charterparty was in the English language and contained a reference to the 'act of the King’s enemies' - which facts the «ourt considered to be strong evidence that English law was intended as the proper law of the contract. 3. Although it is not certain that in the present case the arbitrators would apply English law as the proper law of the contract, there are in my opinion strong indications in that direction. These indications seriously weaken the alternative of the proper lav; cf the •ontract being the law of the State of Kuwait. In any case, even if the arbitrators are not bound exclusively by the rules cf English, or Kuwait, or international ^aw, it is probable that they are bound - or would consider themselves bound - by what, in the language of Article 38(3) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, are 'general principles of law recognised by civilised States'. These comprise general principles of law as determined both by the municipal law of States (such as English law) and international law. This, for instance, was the view of the arbitrators in the Lena Goldfields Arbitration between the latter company and the Soviet Government, decided in 1930. In that case the arbitrators acceptedthe view put forv/ard by the plaintiff company that although, with regard to the performance of the concessionary contract in Russia, Russian lav; was 'the proper lav; of the contract'; for other purposes the general principles of law such as those recognised by Article 38 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice should be regarded as 'the proper law of the contract' ( Annual Digest and Reports cf Public International Law Cases . 1929-1930, Case No.l) In the circumstances cf the present case and having regard to the provisions of the agreement relating to the place of the arbitration it is safe t^ assume that English law will be in any case an important constituent element of the 'general principles of lav;' thus applicable. In addition to being indirectly relevant as forming part of the 'general principles of law as recognised by civilised States', the rules and principles of international law are directly germane to the present case inasmuch as international arbitral and judicial practice has evolved a considerable body cf precedent as to the evidential value of maps. Reliance is als« placed in the present Opinion on the 'general principles of law' - which, as mentioned, are probably the 'proper law' of the arbitration - inasmuch as these include general consideration of equity and fair dealing. These considerations are directly related to the question in issue and they are likely to influence powerfully the decision of the arbitrators. II THE MAP. THE QARU AND OTHER ISLANDS. It is my opinion that the position of the Kuwait Oil Company in this matter is well founded both in law andequity. This is so if we assume - and that, in my view, is the right assumption - that there is no discrepancy between the map and the apparent intention of Article 1 of the concession to confer upon the Kuwait Oil Company exclusive rights in relation to the whole State of Kuwait. This is so also if we assume that there does exist a discrepancy for in that case the Kuwait Oil Company will be in the position to plead that, in the circumstances of the case, the map must yield to the obvious purpose of Article 1 and of the Agreement as a whole. It is not at all necessary to assume that there is a discrepancy between the agreement of 193-4- and the map. There is no such discrepancy. The agreement does not refer to 'such islands as are shown on the map'. It refers to all islands as shown generally on the map, While thus expressing clearly their intention to convey and accept the concession in respect of all islands, the signatories of the agreement did more than that; by adding a significantly qualifying reference to the map they expressly discarded any intention of . restricting the grant. The word 'generally' is not without a meaning; neither was its insertion accidental. Parties dr not insert without good reason into a legal instrument a qualification of that nature. The parties to the agreement clearly did not intend any rigid adherence to the map to interfere with the comprehensiveness of the grant. I appreciate that the word 'generally' is of importance not only in relation to the islands but also for the mainland. Thus it is clear that the map alone does not contain sufficient information to permit the accurate location of the boundaries of the mainland, in particular in the south and the most northern comer. The carefully qualified language of'I K 3 Article 1 of the Agreement shows clearly that the intention was to cover the whole State of Kuwait as recognised in international instruments. Accordingly the map could have been intended only to show the whole of the State of Kuwait in the sense of its general location rather than as determined by any specific boundaries or as including any specific islands belonging thereto. 8, It will be noted that, according to Article 1 of the Agreement, the concession of the right to ’’explore, search, drill for, produce, and win' petroleum within the State of Kuwait is granted exclusively to the Kuwait Oil Company. This means that no construction of the agreement can be countenanced which leaves any paid: of the territories of the State of Kuwait - including islands - outside the purview of the concession. The exclusiveness of the concession is of the essence of the right granted to it. It pervades the entire Agreement, In the exceptional cases in which the Agreement permits the granting of some rights to othur companies the exception is expressed in clear terms (as, for instance, in Article 9(B) which lays down that the Shaikh shall retain for himself the right to grant - in consultation with the Kuwait Oil Company - to another Company or Companies operating petroleum areas within territories adjoining the Kuwait borders the right to lay down pipelines and to permit the erection of buildings and machinery for the transport cf oil; or in Article 15 (a) relating to the right of the Shaikh to grant to other parties concessions in respect of substances other than petroleum). Moreover, weight must be attached to the fact that the agreement refers throughout to the State of Kuwait - i,e, the State of Kuwait in its ent irety.There was at the time of the signature of the agr^o^ont no longer any uncertainty or international controversy as to the extent of the territory of Kuwait. Any outstanding doubts in relation to Iraq were removed by the memorandum of the High Commissioner for Iraq of 19 April 1923 in v/hich recognition was given to the hitherto disputed claims of the Shaikh to certain islands and parts of the frontier. Accordingly, the qualification 'generally' must be deemed to refer not to any uncertainty as to the extent of the territory of Kuwait but to considerations connected with the uncertainty as to the location of some boundaries and possible iinperfections of the map. The only question which has arisen so far as to the accuracy of the map is that relating to the islands. In fact the information supplied to me by the Kuwait Oil Company as to the history of the negotiations preceding the gnature of the agreement and the preparation of the map attached to the agreement fully explains both the suspicion, present to the minds of the signatories, of possible gaps in the map and the consequent insertion of the term 'generally'. That information is to the effect that: (a) the circumstance that the islands of Qaru, Kubba, Umm al Maradim (and other islands) belonged to the State of Kuwait was well known to the Kuwait Oil Company negotiators who signed the concession document as well as to the Shaikh of Kuwait; (b) the wording of Article 1 of the concession document was intended and believed to include those islands; (c) no relevance was attached to the fact that these, and other, islands were not shown on the maps annexed to the agreement, as the word 'generally' in Article 1 and the other wording of Article 1 'the state of Kuwait includingall islands and territorial waters appertaining to Kuwait' clearly covered the whole territory of the State of Kuwait which was both officially and generally known to include these islands; (d)at no tirie was it indicated by the Shaikh to the Kuwait Oil Conpany negotiators that these or any other islands or part of the State of Kuwait were intended to be excluded from the concession area as defined in the agreement, or that the map annexed had any particular significance in this cr any other respect. The circumstances as outlined above - the compre hensiveness and exclusiveness of the grant, the reference to 'all islands', the insertion of the term 'generally', the history of the negotiations preceding the agreement - all these circum stances suggest most cogently that the signatories of the agreement in fact intended to include in the concession all islands under the sovereignty of the Shaikh whether expressly sho\/n on the map or not. This being so there rests upon the Shaikh the onus of proving that both parties to the agreement knew of the existence of islands not shown on the map and deliberately refrained from including them. It is a universally recognised principle of law that the burden of proving an assertion derogating from the apparent comprehensiveness of the grant rests upon the grantor. In that case the comprehensive ness of the grant is more than apparent; it is expressed unequivocally by the clear language of the agreement. Nothing short of some such proof as suggested above is likely to satisfy a body of arbitrators acting in accordance with principles of law and equity. The arbitrators will be bound either to aot on the view that the Shaikh knew of the existence of the Qaru and the other disputed islands and that he regarded the fact of their absence from the map as adequately regularized by the insertion■■■■■I/'N of the term 'generally 1 '; or the arbitrators \vill assume- that the Shaikh had no knowledge of the islands in question and that the term 'generally' covered sufficiently that contingency, 12, There will be nothing to prevent the arbitrators from considering the circumstances accompanying the conclusion of the agreement and in particular any record of or evide 1 ^' ■ relating to the negotiations preceding the agreement. While municipal courts will not, as a rule, admit parol evidence to vary the express terms of a written contract, they do not hesitate about admitting such evidence for purposes falling short of varying express terms of an unequivocal agreement. In particular such evidence is regularly admitted in cases of a real or apparent discrepancy between the description of a property in a contract and the map accompanying it. Insofar as the practice of international tribunals is concerned it is an accepted (and almost invariable) rule to admit as evidence so-called preparatory work ( travaux preparatoires ) - i.e,, the record of the negotiations before and at the conference leading to the conclusion of the treaty and instructions issued to the plenipotentiaries. International tribunals do not follow the rule which is peculiar to English law and which precludes courts from admitting as evidence the debates in Parliament preceding the passing of an Act, Recourse to travaux preparatoires is a constant feature of international practice. In fact even English courts have admitted them for the purpose of interpreting treaties. All this is of importance insofar as the arbitrators in a case such as the present can apply general principles of law and insofar as the concession agreement of 23 December 1934 is treated as a species of an international document. 9.It will appear frcn what has been said so far that, having regard to the language of the agreement in particular to the word 'generally' and to the circunstances surrounding the granting of the concession, there is nr necessity to assume a discrepancy between the agreement and the nap annexed thereto. However, even if we ignore the tern 'generally' and if we assume that there exists a discrepancy, it does not follow that the map must prevail over the agreement. On the contrary there is substantial evidence in international and municipal practice which points to a different conclusion. Inasmuch as the present issue bears upon the extent and the frontiers of the territory of a State, the international practice in the matter is particularly instructive. That international practice reveals clearly the limited importance of maps as a means of ascertaining the intention of the parties. Y/hile any more detailed elaboration of the term must be reserved for a future occasion, a number of examples may be mentioned here: (a) As far back as 1751 we find the British Commissioners, in the dispute concerning the limits of Nova Scotia or Arcadia, using the following language: 'Maps are from the Nature of them a very slight Evidence. Geographers often lay them down upon incorrect Surveys, copying the Mistakes of one another; and if, the Survey be correct, the Maps taken from them, tho* they may show the true position of a Country, the Situation Islands and Towns, and the Course of Rivers, yet can never determine the limits of a Territory, which depenr entirely upon authentic Proof: and the Proofs in that Case, upon which the Maps should be founded to give them any weight, would be themselves a better Evidence, and therefore ought to be produced in a Dispute of this Naturein which the Rights of Kingdoms are concerned,' ( Memorial of the British Commissioners , January 11, 1751, quoted as Document No,1430, Joint Appendix, Canada - Newfoundland Boundary Dispute in the Labrador Peninsula , vol,VIII, p.3755.) (b) In 1896 the Supreme Court of the United States gave a decision in United States v, Texas (162 U.S, 1, 37-42) interpreting Article III of the treaty between the United States and Spain of 1819 which laid down the boundary lino between the two countries west of Mississippi describing it as 'then following the course of the Ric Roxo, westward, to the degree of longitude 100 west from London and 23 f-om Washington ,,, the whole being as laid down in Melish’s Hap of the United States Actually Melish*s Map located the 100th meridian considerably east of the place where the true meridian is. The Supreme Court held that the reference to the ICOth meridian was to that meridian as astronomically located, and not necessarily to the 100th meridian as located on the Melish* s map. The judgment of the Court contains much useful material favourable to the case of the Kuwait Oil Company. (c) The following passage may be quoted from the Award made on 4 April 1928 by Huber, Sole Arbitrator in the Islands of Palmas arbitration between the United States and the Netherlands: 'If the Arbitrator is satisfied as to the existence of legally relevant facts which contradict statement of cartographers whose sources of information are not kno\/n, ne can attach no weight to the maps, however numerous and generally appreciated they may be. The first condition required of maps that are to serve as evidence on points of law is their geographical accuracy. It must here be pointed out that not only maps of ancient origin, but alsomodern, even official or semi-official maps seem wanting in accuracy'. (Award as published by the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration 1928, p.37). (d) The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in the course of its Opinion, given in 1927, in the Canada - Newfoundland Boundary Dispute said: 'The maps here referred to, even when issued or accepted by Departments of the Canadian Government, cannot be treated as admissions binding on that Government; for even if such an admission would be effectively made, the departments conoemed are not shown to have had any authority to make it.' (137 L.T.R. I 87 , 199). But the tribunal attached 'some value to the fact that throughout a long series of years th® maps issued by Canada supported or v/ere consistent with the claim now put forward by Newfoundland. (it may be noted that the eight volumes of documents of this case as printed in connection with the proceedings before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council contain some material relevant to the present case. So do the Proceedings in the Alaskan Bo una-^ry Dispute in 1903 between Great Britain and the United States as well as the Proceedings of the British- American Commission under the Jay Treaty of 1794 which was asked to pronounce on the question: 'What river was truly intended under the name of St.Croix mentioned in the Treaty of Peace?'. The proceedings of the Commission are printed in Moore, International Adjudication s, vols. I and II (1929). In.due course a more detailed examination of all these sources will prove to be helpful.) (e) In its Eighth Advisory Opinion, given in December 1923, on the question of the Polish—Czechoslovakian Prontie' - the Permanent Court of International Justice remarked that: it is true that maps and their tables of explanatory signs13. cannot be regarded as conclusive proof, independently of the text of the treaties and decisions” - though the Court proceeded to state that: 'in the present case they confirm in a singularly convincing manner the conclusions drawn from the doconents and from a legal analysis of them”. (Publications of the Court, Series B, No,8, p,33). (f) The practice, as outlined above, of international tribunals in the matter has prompted a recent writer on the subject to urge the uniform adoption of a clear rule to the effect that 'in case of differences between the text and the maps, the text will prevail” (Jones Boundary - Making (19^-5), p. 64 ). 15. It is not considered necessary, at this juncture ; to add to the length of the present Opinion by a detailed con^-i deration of English law on the subject. Yet, in view of the indications that the English lav; is the 'proper law of the contract”, and, in any case, in view of the fact that English law is an important constituent element of the 'general principles of lav;” which my in fact become the proper law of the contract, it may be useful to state briefly what is believed to be the position in English lav;. Apart from the general principle, referred to ab ve, that in case of doubt and obscurity the grant will be construed against the grantor, the rule governing the matter is that when a map is attached for the purpose of a general identification of parcels adequately and sufficiently described in the contract the latter will prevail. This rule is merely an application of the wider and well-settled legal principle - which is clearly a general principle of law - expressed in the maxim falsa demonstratio non noc et. That principle would apply specially to cases where the description is as comprehensive as that in the concessiongranted to the Kuwait Oil Company, The rule is stated with clarity by Lord Atkinson in Watchan v. Attorney General of East Africa Protectorate (1919) A.C. 533, 540, 541: 'Where in a grant of land there is any discrepancy between the parcels as described, and any plan referred to then as far as that discrepancy extends, the description of the parcels will generally prevail. Where a deed contains an adequate and sufficient definition of the property which it was intended to pass, any erroneous statements contained in it as to the dimensions or quantity of the property, or any inaccuracy in a plan by which it purports to be described will not vitiate this description.' (in an Appendix to this Opinion reference is made to a series of cases substantiating and qualifying the above principle. Of these cases, Willis v, V/atney is particularly clear authority on the subject since it goes substantially further than the contentions here put forward by the Company, III CONCLUSION 16. The preceding considerations lead me to the conclusion that the case of the Company is sound in law and equity. (Sgd* ) H.LAUTSHPACHT. 14th March 1949.APPENDIX SOME ENGLISH DECISIONS BEARING UPON DI SCREP/J'ICIES BET^ETJ THE PARCELS CLAUSE AND PLANS.It nay be useful to'survey some English cases illustrating the rule, referred to above on p, lli to the effect 'when a nap is attached for the purpose of a general identification of parcels adequately and sufficiently described in the contract the latter will prevail', 'There a plan is attached to a Conveyance as part of the parcels clause its effect varies accord ing to the expression employed to annex it, A series of cases illustrate the proposition that where either the special circumstances of the case or the loose degree of annexation of the plan so permit, the Court will not hesitate, in cases of discrepancy, to ignore and jettison the plan, Taylor v. Ashton (181*0) 1 Scott (N.S.) £?6 is a case very much in point. This was an action of trover for lead ore. The plaintiffs maintained that the defendants wrongfully extracted lead ore from a spot to which the plaintiffs claimed rights. The plaintiffs held under a'lease which demised to them all mines and minerals 'in, upon or under all or any part of the messuages or tenements fields, closes, or parcels of land described and set forth in the map thereunto annexed; and also in, upon, or under all or any part of that large tract of land called Mold Mountain; all which premises are situate &amp;c and are bounded &amp;c and all which are particularly described, delineated, and Distinguished in the map or plan thereof annexed to these presents, and vdiich by agreement of all the sabd several parties thereto was meant and intended to be taken as part of that indenture,' It was held that the words of the demise were not to be controlled or' restrained by the map, but might receive full effect, and be held to include a particular spot the boundary of which could not be traced with strict accuracy upon the map, by reason of the smallness of the scale upon which it was drawn, ' In Willis v. 'Jatney (1881) £l L.J. (N.S,) Ch,l8l, the question was whether a certain yard had passed to the plaintiff. The words in the convey ance were 'and all Yards thereto belonging and therewith occupied and enjoyed delineated on the plan and therein coloured', etc, A yard which had been enjoyed with the messuages was delineated on the plan, but not coloured. It was held, by Fry, J,, that the yard passed by description in the deed. Again, in Horne v, Struben (1902) A.C. hZb, the Privy Council held 'that in a grant of land with-certain specified boundaries, 'as will further appear by the diagram framed by the surveyor', where the diagram is repugnant to the terms of the grant, the latter will prevail,' In the course of his speech Lord Robertson said, 'If in a matter not requiring elucidation the diagram is repugnant to the text, this merely shows (what in the present instance is abundantly proved by other circumstances) that the diagram is not exact, and affords only a rough delineation of the farm,'Similarly, in Gregg v. Richards (1926) 1 Ch, ^21, the Court of* 'Appeal held that the delineation of a road in a plan 'indorsed on these presents' did not amount to an unequivocal expression of 'contrary intension' sufficient to negative the passing of an easement of way on that road. It is to be noted that in the cases already mentioned the words by which the plan and the parcels clause or other description in the conveyance or contract have been attached to each oih^-not been very specific. Nonetheless everyone of the phrases employed is considerably stronger than that used in the Agreement made by the Kuwait Oil Company in 193h# Yet even in those cases the plan did not prevail over the description. In another series of cases the plan was held to be an inseparable part of the description, though inseparable only because of the formula of annexation employed. There is no hint of any such formula or intention in article 1 of the agreement with tie Shaikh, The expression of annexation employed in Lyle v„ Richards (1866) L.R, 1 H.L. 222 was; 'which said premises are particularly described by the map on the back of this sett.' The House of Lords held that the Judge was bound to look to the map as forming part of the deed. In Eastwood v, Ashton'(1915) A.C. 900 decided in the House of'Lords, the land to be' conveyed was described in the deed as follows, omitting what is superfluous: 'All that farm called Bank Hay Farm ,., containing 8h acres 3 roods and h perches or thereabouts and in the occupation as to part thereof of T.H,and as^to the remainder thereof of C.' rr .C., all of which said premises are more particularly described in the plan endorsed on these presents and are de lineated and coloured red in such plan'. It was held that the description by reference to the plan ought to prevail and that the disputed strip of land was included in the conveyance. The most recent case on the subject, Wellington v. Townsend (1939) 2 All E.R. 225 is to tne same effect^ ' Both series of decisions illustrate the proposition that in the absence of express words to the contrary the Courts will consider the description as self-sufficient.Telegram From To iqS ij 4 3j 7 OTP Prod rome, Bah rain Foreign Office, London ( telegram No. 269 June 7th ) Repeated Political, Kuwait No. 155 Dated and received the 7th June, 1949. v / Priority .

Sir, With reference to Bahrain despatch No.55(52/55/49) of the 2/th June, I have the honour to inform you that information here sug L ests that Mr.MacPherson's resignation from the Arabian American Oil Company is likely to have been principally due to friction resulting from changes in the balance of power between the various American oil companies who participate in the Arabian venture. 2. Mr. MacPherson was originally employed by the Standard Oil Company of California, who owned all the shares in the Arabian American Oil Company at the time when the latter was formed. That holding has now dwindled to one of about ten per cent, and I understand that the other participating companies have been pressing for some time for some re-allocation of executive posts to take account of the changes in the financial holdings. Whether there was.any demand for the removal of Mr. MacPherson, ) who was respected by all and feared by some, I do not know, out the stresses existing in the Company may well have had some part in Mr. MacPherson’s decision to change horses when the possibility of employment with the .American Inde pendent Oil Company presented itself. 3. I underaiand also that Mr. MacPherson was opposed to the company's decision to cut back production to a daily rate of 500,000 barrels as he believed that development ought to be pushed ahead and that additional oil could be sold for sterling. 4. Whatever the cause, his abrupt resignation apparently came as a complete surprise not only to the United States Ambassador here but also, I believe, to Arabian American Oil Company itself, and his post remained unfilled for some weeks. I learned a few days ago that a Mr. F.A. Davies will shortly be coming from Arabian American Oil Company's head office in the United States to replace Mr. MacPherson temporarily. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Washington, to the Head of the British Middle East Office, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Mr. Palmer Aminco representative in London has referred this point to us asKing whether we could agree to dispense with an indemnity clause in respect of any loss incurred by Sheikh as a result of establishment of prior claims by another company. His company thought we might have changed our view on this point if it was the case that we had not insisted upon a clause of this (mut) being included in the concession granted for the sea-bed at ^atar. Company also wished to Know whether His Majesty f s Government had any objection to concessions being obtained for sea-bed areas permitting operations to start pending decision of possible prior claims. Palmer has been told that we have never opposed grant of such concessions sub ject to reservations being made with regard to prior claims. He was also told that in the case of v^atar sea bed concessions / there was no specific reference to an indemnity though the concessions differ^ in- several respects from the draft concession which we had previously discussed with outstand ing amiability and cases were not perhaps strictly parallel. V/e would feel it necessary therefore to explain fully to the Sheikh of Kuwait possible advantage from his point of'—■' /% ) view of including an indemnity clause but if after considr-.l ering points he did not wish to insist on doing so we should not try to impose a condition ? on this kind on him or on a company negotating a concession with him. 5. You should inform Kemp of above for the information of the Sheikh mentioning that in accordance ^ S' t f° with ? paragraph 3 c of our telegram 100'Sheikh was previously advised to protect himself with an indemnity clause.

I am now to inform you that the draft concessions have again been examined by the Foreign Office and there seems to be no objection to their terms, apart from a few minor changes of wording and arrangement* Copies of the drafts showing the minor amendments suggested were despat ched to Kuwait on A ugust the 12th but have not yet arrived 3# When the question was first discussed of whether the American Independent Oil Company could be permitted to seek a concession for the three Islands, it was decided to recommend to the Sheikh the inclusion of a clause safe guarding prior rights and warning him against any possible counter-claims should he gecide to grant a concession to the A merican Independent Oil Company.

(3) At the time of^ceceipt of your letter, Mr. MacPherson, of Aminoil, and I had reached the following stage of negotiation:- Subject to certain amendments to the draft concession for the three islands, among v/hich was the inclusion of the draft indemnity clause attached to your letter instead of a much v/ider clause which I had drafted, Mr. MacPherson had stated that he ’’would sign” on behalf of Aminoil. That is, he committed himself to the draft and would ask for no further amendments. I commenced a subsequent meeting by reminding him of this and having it confirmed. (4) The draft indemnity clause and the corresponding Article in the draft concession contain the words ”or otherwise disposed of”. (5) The information contained in your paragraph (4) has presumably been communicated to Mr. MacPherson. I am extremely reluctant to propose the deletion of the above words lest this should give Mr. MacPherson the opportunity, v/hich he would doubtless seize, of re-opening the issue by questioning the need for an indemnity clause and , perhaps, strengthening his arguments by saying that H.M.Government ’’would not try to impose a condition of this kind. ”/ (6) If the deletion of the words concerned is regarded as essential, I beg to suggest that the best opportunity of securing it is when the draft concession is submitted to H.M.Government, when the deletion might not present the difficulties which it now does.

CONFIDENTIAL. The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, S.V/.l Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Cuwait Oil Company T s letter of the 23rd May, 1949, v.ritten with reference to the claim of the Company that the islands appertaining to the State of Kuwait are comprised within the Company T s concession. 2. 0 ince the Company’s letter of the 23rd May, 1949, was written ohe SheiTh of Cuwait has issued the Proclama tion of June- 12th, 1949, declaring ohat the sea-bed and subsoil lying beneath the high seas of the Persian Gulf contiguous to the territorial waters of Tuwait a \oertain- to and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of she State of Tuwait. 3. It is the view of the Company that the sea-bed and subsoil in question plainly fall within the exclusive concessio granted to the Company. His Highness has indicated to the Company through his Representative in London that he does not accept this view. 4. It, therefore, see- .s expedient that the Company should- as it did with reference to the islands- submit to His High.:ess proof of the Company’s claim that the sea-bed and subsoil in question are included within the area covered byithe exclusive concession granted to the Company by the Agreement of December, 23 -d, 1934. 5. Rather tie n develop the detailed proof of its claim at this stage the Company believes that it would be more helpful to follow the proced ire which it employed in putting forward its claim in regard to uhe islands and accordingly submits to His Highness as an awnexure to this letter, a legal opinion which it has obtained from Professor. H. Lauterpacht, H. hewell Professor of International Law in the University of Cambridge. 6. The opinion sho ;s t iat the sea-bee a ml subsoil in' question are covered by the concession granted to the Company. flic Company earnestly hopes that after a study of its contents by His Highness agree ent will be reached as envisa ed by Articleld of the Company’s concession and that consequently it will not be necessary to refer 1 the question at issue to arbitr... tion as provided by that article. 7. I am accordingly instructed by the Directors to say that they would be groteful if this letter and its annexure could be forwarded His Highness as soon aspossible. The Jireetors would also appreciate confirmation at your earliest convenience that His ’ r ighness has received these documents. 3. as soon as practicable Arabic translations of this letter and its sHxiaanir annexure will be forward ed for transmission to the Shaixh.

October 21st, 1949 Dear Rogers, This is to let you know that today I met Kemp, who spoke to me regarding his recent visit to Kuwait. He thanked us for spotting the error in the Islands Ll&amp;ty Concession whereby the Sheikh of Kuwait would receive no payments unless Aminco were successful in developing commeraial production exceeding 2,000 tons per day. He also informed me that K.O.C. had recently told him that they would be asking the sheikh for arbitration in connection with the validity of Arainco* s Island Concession. With regard to the Neutral Zone, he said that Aminco would start drilling in November and their initial programme was for four exploration $e11s.

MacPherson of .AJ’INOIL called today and said that 90 Americans head just been sent to the Neutral Zone to commence drilling operations. The site of the first well was V/A.PRA in the centre of the Neutral Zone. NacPherson said he had t-ken 5 Kuwaiti guards and would t^ke nore as required. He vaguely referred to getting Saudi guards. 2. I drew his attention to the Political Agreement (of which he said he had no copy but was get ting one) particularly with regard to the nationality of persons employed and the restrictions on direct approached to Kuwait Gcvernrert. I said he should have referred the question of guards to the Agency. He ad mitted that in this respect he had not adhered to ten s of agreement through ignorance and in his anxiety to get going on the rain job which was to find oil. I said that in any case he had nothing whatever to do with the Saudis. When I explained that it was better to start off on the night foot he agreed and added that one should keep in step afterwards. I rointid out the dif'ere^ce between the background here and his previous Saudi back ground . 3.

V/e have therefore six ronths in v^hich to reach an agreement with the Saudi Governrent on the question of jurisdiction in the Neutral Zone and I should suggest th- t negotations should be started irrrediatley. I presume that at all costs we wish to avoid the Saudis, as is their tendency,.taking the law into their own hands. 3. The Americans are being lodged in a specially fitted American vessel anchored li riles off shore. They are driven in to work every day. If for the tire beings we can manage to restrict national ities erployed to British, Americans and Kuwaitis risk is diminished of an incident tint ray raise in an acute forr the question of jurisdiction in the Neutral Zone.

Dear Sir, You have informed us that, after having considered the explanation of the Company's contention that petroleum rights in all islands appertaining to Kuwait, including the islands of Kubba, Qaru and Umm al Maradim are covered by its Concession, His Highness remains unable to accept this contention* The Company sincerely regrets the. difference of interpretation which has arisen, but since it has not been found possible to settle the question in any other way, it becomes necessary that this difference be referred to arbitration in accordance with the procedure set out by His Highness and the Company in Article 18 of the Concession. The Company has therefore nominated the Right Honourable Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, K.C., as arbitrator, and now formally requests His Highness, through you, to nominate his own arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of Article 18(B) of the Concession.

I agree that question of jurisdiction in the Neutral Zon^should be ta*cen up urgently. • So far as jurisdiction in the narrower sense of the word is concerned we might perhaps reach a temporary wording agreement whereby all employees of AMINCO excluding Saudi subjects would be subject to the Kuwait Courts including in respect of nationals of non-moslem states of the Political Agent’s dourt and that employees of the Western Pacific excluding Kuwaitis would be subject to Saudi Courts. 2. Question of general administration has also to be considered including as one of the first items a customs (gr. undecypherable).
