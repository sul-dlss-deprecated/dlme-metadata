In the name of God, the best of names ! From Taimur bin Faisal. To the presence of our noble friend, Major Knox, Consul of the Government of Great Britain. Alter increase of greeting and respect to your honoured excellency, I inform your honour that our lord and father died on the night of the fourth of The al Qa’ida (=night of 4th October) at ten minutes past one (Arabic time=about 7 p. m.) of the year 1331 H. and we bore him to ttie tomb at 2 o’clock in the morning (Arabic time—8 a. m.) of the aforesaid day (=5th of October) and we are cer tainly in the greatest sorrow and grief on account of this severe calamity.. And on the 8th day of the aforesaid month (=9th October 1913), I took my seat on the throne of the successor, prepared to undertake the duties and the benefits of our Oman Government, accepting the responsibilities thereof in obedience to the order issuing from my lord and father in that respect. Now it was incumbent on me to inform you of that, so that you may acquaint the Glorious Government in accordance with the obligations of friendship and unity existing between the two Governments from old time, and it is my inten tion and firm resolve that that friendship and the bonds between me and your great Government shall not cease to be strengthened and increased. This is what it was necessary to communicate and salaam. Written on the 8th day of The al Qa’ida 1331 H. (Signed) TAIMUR BIN FAISAL.® 0 {1) F.A.

Position in this instance differs ‘rom that which arose in previous cases. During late Sultan’s life time we practically treated Taimur as heir apparent. I arrived Masqat Gth Instant and paid informal visit of condolence to Al 8u Saiyid family same day. All Saiyid Faisal’s sons were present and also sons of Kuha mad bin Turk! but latter did not attend himself. On Oth instant Al 3u Saiyid family returned my visit at which Viceroy’s message of condolence was officially communicated to them. On this occasion neither Muhammad bin Turk! nor his sons were present. Taimur’s brothers then informed Political Agent and myself in Taimur’a presence that they concurred in Tainur’s accession and would render him all loyalty and suuport. On 9th instant Taimur installed himself at formal assembly of leading inhabitants and retainers and afterwards addressed identic letter to Foreign representatives inti mating that in accordance with his father’s directions he had taken over the reins of government and requested that they would inform thfeir Governments accordingly. At our meeting on 8th I had informed him. that I con sidered that he should address a supplementary communication to British Agency saying that he realised that he could not hold his own without our material and moral -support and begging Political Agent to assure Government that he accepted all the obligations which his father boro towards the British Government and intended to pursue his father’s policy, in regard to the arms traffic as well as other matters, and undertook to be guided by our advice in all important questionsquestions (of course without prejudice to his independence' - Then in conclusion he was to say that he hoped that Govern ment would strengthen his hands for the difficult task be fore him by according him official recognition b,s ape dily as practicable. The natural corollary of ouch recognition being in our case the continuance of the subsidies paid to his father. Seeing that the greater part of Oman is dis affected and that the rebels claim to have deposed the lato Sultan and started a new dynasty in the person of the Imam pretender, It would bo obviously bootless to consult the tribes in this case, and therefore provided that he wrote a letter on the above lines, as he said he was ready to do, wo intended to recommend that, unless any important change of policy '.vaa contemplated in connection with Saiyld Faisal's death, Government should authorise us by telegraph to inti mate their recognition and to continue payment of subsidy as usual, without requiring any further conditions than the general undertakings above mentioned. Having been badly ad vised I think, by his relatives Tairur at first sen* a letter in unsuitable terms which I refused to accept and from 9th to 12th the wording ms patiently discussed and only one point remained fcr adjustment when the incident occurred described in ray immediately following telegram.
