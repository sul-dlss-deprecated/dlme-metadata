Nour relates that mother died when she was young, and that her father remarried after her death. She describes the large house in Qurna where the family lived and raised livestock, and how evenings were spent in the courtyard. Her father had worked as a guard at historic monuments and tourist sites, as well as working in agriculture. Nour notes that she had not received an education, and that she also used to raise livestock. In describing living conditions on the hillside, she mentions that there was no electricity or clean water. Despite the lack of infrastructure, she recalls her happiness living in Qurna, and that people were kind towards each other.  Nour discusses aspects of family life like childbirth and the role of midwives. She notes that she and her family moved to the city for some time before the displacement from the hillside, seeking better living conditions like clean water, and contrasts relations among neighbors in the city with the communal life of Qurna. Nour regrets the demolishing of the houses (like her fatherâ€™s) on the hillside, claims that many of the former Qurna residents were dissatisfied with the homes they received in compensation, which were smaller than those they owned on the hillside.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
