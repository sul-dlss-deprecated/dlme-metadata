Why he is delaying a little is because he wishes to make some suggestions in connection with the Agreements. One is about hunting over the frontier by himself and members of the Subah family, and the other is the virtual impossibility of guaranteeing that there may not be some passing over the frontier of goods going from hand to hand in the tribes. I will give you my views about these two, and any other point he raises, when 1 receive them but it looks as if they can, if necessary, be dealt with in an explanatory letter, and no alteration whatever need be made in the Agreements.

Good Neighbourly Halations, for the Extradition of Offenders and for the He-organiaation of Trade between the Oovemrasnt of Saudi Arabia, on the one hand, and Kuwait, on the otiiey, I heg to inform you that I have gone through these agreements, ?nd I am very glad that the political and economical relations of the two 'brotherly States should 'be put on this clear 'basis, which will strengthen and cement their friendly relations with which they were and are still conneoted, and help to the continuance of good understanding 'between them. The efforts made 'by the Bepresentatives of His Majesty's Government in this matter deserve appreciation and gratitude. These efforts strengthen the mutual friendly .nd cordial relations which exist 'between His Majesty's Government nd their Arab friends. point out to you, as although these observations are non-essential to the Agreements, yet I consider that they should 'be touched upon. (1) paragraph (a) of Article 1 of the Trade 'igrsement says in respect of goods exported from Kuwait 'by land, 'Any person who is not with a caravan shall 'be regarded as a smuggler, even if he has a manifest. There are some ohservations v .hich I wish to What/-- 2 - What Is meant 'by the word , Oa^avan , ? What nuaiber oaa properly be oallsl with this name? ^ 'jf ^ ^ ♦ Here the miiiimua llruit for the number of oaravan people is to be fixed so that there will he no oompllcations in regard to this point in future. (2) Paragraph (d) of the same Artiole. 'Persons entering Kurait territory from Saudi AraMa to 'buy goods for their own oonauraption aaigt travel in parties and conform to the conSitions laid down on conraeroial oaraTans. Although this paragraph oan easily be applied to the townsmen, its application to the bedouins of the desert will cause great confusions and difficulties for them, as it is not easy for them to collect and form a caravan owing to their speediy movements and numerous residences and destinations. To this may be added the fact that their own requirements are nearly always unworthy and of a low cost. (3) It is desirable that the free moveaent defined in Article 9 of the Agreement for the Promotion of Friendly and Good Ueighbouly Belations Between the Two States, should ' cover those who move on both sides of the frontiers for hunting and hakwing as well as the messenger who goes to a fixed destination in order to collect a debt owed to him by anyone on the other side of the frontier or any other personal business. Article 9 should,I therefore, apply to the hunters and messengers as far as free movement is concerned. j These are my observations which I am submitting to vou ((Vf-A P-&lt;*• t0 y0U * ^ 'VoUO., qui. , ' Usual binding. .10 By Air Mail. fbushire rfsid^cy.] P.Z. i') % i9vo i ^ 0 - '' CONFii&gt;ENTIA'_ REKSDS t i... ■ - — ••J INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, ti'J Ji Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. c .

I ^ 2» You will have seen from our telegram No. 22 of the 5th February to Jedda (a copy of which was sent to you officially) that it appears desirable that the Trade Agreement should take the same form as the other Agreements. I now enclose a draft preamble and a draft termination clause of the Trade Agreement for your concurrence. IM; 3. There is one other point regarding the English text of the Trade Agreement. In the second paragraph of Article 1* the words M Persons entering Koweit territory 'from Saudi Arabia and taking out goods» etc. 11 read as if a these persons were taking goods from Saudi Arabia to Koweit. It is, hov/ever, obvious that the paragraph refers to persons who enter Koweit territory to buy supplies and tafce those supplies back with them to Saudi Arabia. We think therefore that to make the meaning clearer these words should be amended to read: H Persons entering Koweit territory from Saudi Arabia and leaving again with goods bought, etc. H . This is a more literal translation of the Arabic and there would therefore be no need to change the Arabic text. 4* Y/e do not think that there should be any great difficulty in getting this change made in the English by both the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud, and I should be glad if you could let me know whether you agree that such an amendment is desirable.

On finding that the agreements with Kuwait would he signed by His Majesty's Government, the Saudi Government suggested the deletion of the main portion of Article 1 (2) of the draft Bon Voisin age Agreement as superfluous. To this deletion there will, I ouppose, be no objection on the part of His Majesty's Government or of His Highness the Shaikh, but there is a connected point on which I am doubtful. The Saudi Govern ment suggest that in the phrase in the preambles 'acting inJimJL-Omjiame and on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait', the words here underlined are superfluous as expressing a guarantee which they now consider implied by the fact that the agreements will be signed by a repres entative of His Majesty's Government; but I am not sure whether their assumption is correct, or whether the words are not essential in view of the responsibility of His Majesty's Government for the foreign affairs of Kuwait. The Saudi Government propose that the agreements shall te drawn up in Arabic only. They quote as precedents the Bon Voisinage agreements with Iraq and Trans-Jordan, / and39 and they have a strong preference for the use of Arabic alone; 'but they will not make concession on this point a condition of signature. 6.

Notes on the draft Trade Agreement (March 8th. 1935). ^ (l) The wording as received from Kuwait in Arabic is as had already 'been agreed with the Saudi Government. j (2) The list of frontier posts on the Saudi side is as follows; By land: (a) A1 Qarya (h) Hafr. V' By sea: (a) Tas Tanura (h) Jubail (c) Qatif (d) ^3air. 'V ? 4,/ The list of Kuwait posts is awaited. The Saudi Government would be prepared to increase by mutual agreement the num ber of posts on their side if those now proposed proved to be insufficient« v (3) The Saudi Government propose as definition of a 'caravan': one motor-vehicle or three animals. They con tend no hardship would^ be caused with the minimum so low, for no individual would have to wait long for a 'caravan' to assemble. (4) The Saudi Government cling tenaciously to their asser tion that to allow persons from the Saudi side of the frontier to enter Kuwait territory on the pretext of rnusabala (purchase of goods) , without requiring them to have permits from the Saudi authorities, would encourage smuggling and nullify the safeguards proposed. The relevant provision is embodied in Article 11, which covers all cases of crossing the frontier except that of the hunter, but perhaps it would be well to repeat the provision in the Trade Agreement. His Majesty's Legation do not think it possible to get the agreement through without this provision.4/ Enclosure No, 8 in Jedda despatch No. 51 dated March 19th, 1939. Notes on the draft Bon Voisinage Agreement (March 8th., 1939). (1) In the preamble and In Article 1 there are references to relations of friendship and hon voisinage as existing 'between the two countries from of old. In view of the long blockade this wording is not strictly accurate, but the grievances are not all on one side, and in any case it does not seem worth while olDjecting to such formulas. (2) In some passages where the Jedda draft of March 8th. differs from the Kuwait draft it will he found that either the sense and/or the Arabic wording follows the Trans-Jordan Bon Voisinage Agreement more closely than does the Kuwait draft. (3) With the exception of two passages ahout preserving good relations and trying to *settle any differences in a friendly spirit, the whole of Article 1 (2) of the Kuwait draft has 'been cut out by the Saudi Government as unnecessary because us Majesty 1 s Government are to sign the agr.: ^ nt on bohslf -it. -Ln, Article 5 a passage which does not appear in the Kuwait draft 1...^ ur-r. taken from the Trans-Jordan Bon Voisin- ege Agreement; ''Warning must be given in addition to the nearest official and, in case of its being impossible to reach him, to the persons or tribes threatened.' (5) in Article 6 the Saudi Government have inserted the word, smuggling' , on the ground that the prevention of smuggling is -he object of the purpose of the negotiations, or rather that smuggling is the cause of the difficulties which the / negotiationsnegotiations are intended to rerave. ^6) in Article 7 the references to usage and custom In Article 7 (i) of the Kuwait draft have been cut out by the Saudi Government, who declare that In the relations between the two countries such matters have always been dealt with in accordance with the Sharla Law. (■7) The Saudi Government have proposed the omission of Article 7 (g) i n the Kuwait draft. They argue that the corresponding provision in the Trans-Jordan Agreement (.Article 7) has been found unnecessary, and that it is superfluous in the present instance. I am inclined to agree with them in this. (8) The Saudi Government have added to Article 8 of the Kuwait draft a provision that cases whldh the: frontier officials cannot settle shall be referred to the two Con tracting Parties. This provision, which implies reference His Majesty's Legation in Jedda, is all that is left of Aiticle 13, which the Saudi Government consider to be cumbersome, in principle these efforts to attain simplicity are to be encouraged# (9) In Article 9 the words 'or musabal a' have been omitted, as the Saudi Government consider that it would stultify the agreements if any person, was allowed to cross the frontier without permission by merely alleging that he was going to r.iake purchases. The conditions governing the case of Sasabala is to be found in Article 11 (5) of the Jedda draft. (10) The third paragraph of Article 9 in the Jedda draft is based. Shaikh Yusuf informs me, on discussions which have taken place with the Iraa Government who, while unwilling to / allowIf allow Saudi officials to enter their territory for such purpose, are prepared to eject any Saudi tribe into Saudi Arabia on receipt of a demand to that effect from the Saudi Government. Shaikh Yusuf alleges that the Shaikh of Kuwait, by friendly arrangement with Ibn Saud, allowed Saudi tax- collectors to enter Kuwait territory last year to collect z^kat from the Saudi tribes 0 (11) As amended by the Saudi Government, Article 10 allows one Government to employ nationals of the other in its armed forces provided the assent of the latter has been obtained. The Saudi Government say that this amendment is inserted in the interests of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, whose followers include a number of Saudi nationals. They declare that they themselves have nothing to gain by the amendment, which so far as they are concerned can be struck out. (12) Article 11 of the Jedda draft is intended to cover all cases of crossing the frontier, except that of the hunter. Ibn Saud does not wish to state in writing that persons engaged in hunting may cross the frontier without permission, but he has sent word to me through Shaikh lusuf Yasin that this would be winked at under an oral Gentlemen's Agreement 1 '. (15) Article 11 (2) provides for the despatch of officials as messengers to Kuwait or Riyadh. Such persons are to be allowed to cross the frontier with permission from the other Government provided they are 1{ authorised ,, by their own Government. The Saudi Government do not wish to define authorised 11 more exactly, because, they say, this paragraph / onlyonly records in writing a practice which is already working perfectly well, and I suggest that this accommodating spirit is to he welcomed. (14) Article 11 (5) requires the person who wishes to make purchases over the frontier to get a pass from his own side. This provision will he unwelcome to the Government of Kuwait, hut it is regarded as essential hy the Saudi Government. (15) The Saudi Government propose that the operation of Article 12 should he restricted to foreigners since the movements of nationals are governed hy Article 11 as given in the Jedda draft-. This seems logical. (16) Only the A r ahic language is mentioned in the Jedda draft. On this point see the covering despatch. The schedule -. (17) Paragraph 2 (Ara f if) is just as it has 'been drafted oy Shaikh Yusuf, who asserts that it represents exactly the arrangement at present in force between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. His Majesty's Legation did not notice until Yusuf Yasin had left Jedda that his draft mentioned only camels, not animals in general. (18) Paragraph 4 of the Schedule,provides that if a murder is intentional the penalty shall he the execution of the offender, not the payment of hlood money. The Saudi Govern ment claim that this is the procedure which is followed in all cases in Saudi territory. They recently objected o-cause hlood money was paid to the relatives of a Saudi national who had heen murdered deliberately in Trans-Jordan by Trans-d ordan nationals and said that the murderers should / have* * i have 'been executed. It was pointed out to them that the decision was in accordance with the Blood-Money provision in the Schedule to the Trans—Jordan Bon Voisinage Agreementj and they evidently wish to ohviate misunderstanding between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on this point. His Majesty's Legation consider that in principle the Saudi Government are right. It will be noticed that the calculation of the blood money is to be effected according to the Sharia. / ^ y'h'W U9j In paragraph 7 of the Schedule in the Jedda draft the Saudi Government have inserted a list of the tribes they claim as theirs, and they ask that a list of the Kuwait tribes should 'be added* (^0) Article 8 in the Jedda draft has heen added hy Shaikh oTusui. 5 who states that this also simply records in writing a well-known and accepted principle- The title 'Losses' has 'been put in inverted coriimas in the English translation 'because it is alleged to he the accepted term-for property (usually in animals) which disappears? whether it has 'been -lost or stolen. The drafting is not very good, hut perhaps it is near enough for the purpose./ (3) i4$&gt; % enclosure No. 3 in Jedda despatch No., 51 dated March 19th., 1939.' Notes on the draft Extradition Agreement (March 8th, 1939). (l) The question of political crimes (Article 3) has given much trouble. The Saudi Government say that nothing should 'be lelt to the courts, since Sharia lawyers have as many opinions as there are individuals as to what constitutes a political offence. At first they wished t© include all offences 'against the government authorities' among the non-extraditahle offences, hut in the end they replaced this phrase 'by the words 'against the local authorities' which they had found in Article 6 of the extradition treaty between Iraq, and Egypt (a copy of this article is attached to this note) • j.hej' claim that in this matter Iraq, had granted better terms to Egypt than to Saudi Arabia, and Shaikh Yusuf Yasin went to far as to allege that Iraq, had refused to widen the scope of the term 'political offence' in the extradition treaty of 1930 with the deliberate intention of sheltering as many criminals from Saudi Arabia as possible. Ibn Saud appears to be determined that Kuwait shall not be used in this way. But the words 'local authorities' are rather vague. Shaikh Yusuf gives as examples resistance to the police or the frontier guards.. (2) Smuggling is included in the list of offences, in Article 3, for which extradition shall be granted, but it is explained in the draft letters attached that this only applies to the case where a suspected smuggler who is not a Kuwaiti escapes from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait territory.U1 (3) A second pair of draft letters explain that offences commonly committed by the heduin shall not be considered political offences. These drafts follow closely letters annexed to the Saudi-Ira^ Extradition Treaty of 1930. (4) The Saudi Government have proposed the excision of Article 4 (2) in the Kuwait draft, which requires that all the documents included in the demand for extradition shall bear the seal of the competent authority. Their argument is that this does not suit the Saudi form of administration, and that since the demand will be presented by the Govern ment of Saudi Arabia or the Government of Kuwait, which will stand responsible for it, the matter of seals on individual documents is of no importance. It is true that the courts have no independence in such matters here, but if it is desired to restore the provlsdcn about seals, we could quote a similar provision in the Saudi-Iraq. Extradition Treaty, (-t Article 5 in the Jedda draft is new: it has been inserted at the request of the Saudi Government.

Thr Fnrri t n;n PirnTtnr]\ 0nvnrnnirnt nf fTirlin The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3681go S824/39 6/1/34/25) FQREIGH OFFICE, s.w.i. 4th May, 1939 •Gibson, Ksg My dear Gibson, You will have received officially a copy of '' b » 2b | Jedda despatch No. 51 of the 19th March in which were enclosed the drafts of the three Saudi—Koweit agreements as revised by the Saudi Arabian Government# 2* There are many points in these revised drafts which are not satisfactory, but we feel that there is no object in commenting on them in detail until we know how far the Saudi amendments are acceptable to the Political authorities in the Persian Gulf and to the Sheikh of Koweit. When the substance of the agreements is more or less decided, we can consider questions of form and polish 3. There are, however,certain observations which we would like to make straight away: (a) The proposed change in the i&amp;iglish text of article 1(2) of the Trade Agreement (i.e. so as to make it read ^Persons entering Koweit territory from Saudi Arabia and leaving again with goods bought .....*) may as well be embodied the next time the text is copied out, either here or in the Gulf# ^ h i %(s&gt; (b) Similarly, the preamble and temination clauses of the Trade Agreement may as well be added next time the text is copied. But these clauses, as enclosed in rw letter E.607/34/25 of February 14th to Peel, will need to be amended so as to correspond with whatever is decided upon/si 3# upon for the oorresponding clauses of the Bon Voieinage and Extradition Agreements. In addition ^five years' has to be changed to ^three years'* (I am not sure whether you want this change for the Bon Voisinage and Extradition Agreements as well). (c) We have no insuperable objection to omitting 'in their own name' from the preambles to any of the Agreements, although the words seem to emphasise precisely what the Saudi .Arabian Government want, namely that His Majesty's Government by contracting in their own name bind themselves to see that the agreement is carried out on the Koweit side. In other respects the preambles, as re drafted, will want tidying up a bit. (d) The use of the term n two contracting parties' in Articles S, 3 etc. of the Bon Voisinage Agreement will not do, because the contracting parties are His Majesty t s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government while the parties which are to preserve good relations, appoint officials etc. are the Saudi-Arabian Government and the i Koweit Government. In view, particularly, of the proposed omission of 'in their own name' 1 from the preamble, it seems essential to return to the original wording of these articles i.e. 'the Governments of Saudi Arabia and of Koweit'. (e) Our original draft of the Bon Voisinage Agreement spoke of 'frontier officials 1 * throughout. The Saudi re-draft speaks indiscriminately of 'officials', ^frontier officials', 'special officials' and 'competent authority'. It is desirable to use one phrase for one thing throughout. (f) We are not sure what significance to attach to the proposed omission from Article 3 etc. or the words through/3. (3)/ ^through the British Legation at Jedda'• These words are not essential, since, whether they are in or out, the Saudi rabian Government must only communicate with the Sheikh through His Majesty's Government# At the same time they cross a 't', so to speak, without emphasising unduly what ought to 'be obvious, a process which often merely makes the obvious less obvious than before* Perhaps the Saudis wish to leave the way open to use the Saudi Legation in London, which they are quite entitled to d0 ' ^ f?.Ue (g) With regard to (4) of the notes on the Trade Agreement, I am not clear what exactly it is that the Saudis want Included In this Agreement. If you think it desirable, we could ask the Legation 'by telegram to suggest a draft article which they think would meet the Saudi point. (h) We shall have to insist on lingliah and Arabic ae the languages of the Agreements# (i) In the extradition agreement, Koweit cannot undertake to surrender nationals of third States. The Government of Koweit has not got Jurisdiction over the nationals of all third States, hut only over the nationals of other Arab States on the Persian Gulf. His ajesty's Government are, it is true, the party to the agreement and they have the Jurisdiction which the Sheikh of Koweit lacks; but His Majesty's Government could never agree that persons over whom they had jurisdiction should be extradited to Saudi Arabia under an agreement of this character. Therefore Article 1 must either omit the words 'of a third State' or substitute for them 'of a third Arab State'.4. (3) ?/e do not much like the idea of dropping the requirement that documents in extradition cases shall he sealed# The possibilities of the miaase of extradition proceedings are numerous, and we should not have thought that this meagre safeguard would have seriously inconvenienced the Saudi administration# If the requirement about seals has to he dropped we should at least like to substitute something corresponding to our authentication of signatures# Yours ever, (Sd) Lacy BaggallayTelegram From To Eepeated Inter* His Majesty 1 s Minister, jedda.

JP-/93 /y BullardHOT-hl P#A* Kuwait* Re the Saudi - Kuwaiti Agreements the last drafts of which from Jedda (ride Legation despatch No.51 f dated 19th March 1939 to the Foreign Office) we discussed yesterday. 2. The Agreements dealt with in this despatch are the Bon Voisinage and the iiixtradition. The snags divide themselves into two parts: (a) those affecting His Majesty's Government, and ('b) those affecting the Shaiich. (a) are given in Foreign Office letter to the India Office Ho.P,2.2824/39, dated 4th May 1939. (b) These it is up to the Shaiich in the first instance to object to. What we should do there fore as soon as possible is to send him a copy of the latest drafts. As you suggest you can take the spare copies which you have to the Shaiich this evening and have a preliminary canter over them. 3. As you pointed out Clause 7 of the Schedule to the Bon Yoisinage Agreement is likely to prove object ionable to the Shaikh. However we can see what his reaction is. 4. In regard to the Trade Agreement there would appear to be no snags under (a). Under (b) there is the proposal to include in it a provision restricting Musabala as in the Bon Voieinage Agreement, vide Jedda telegram No.65, dated 16th May 1939 to the Foreign Office. This however is not as formidable a snag /snag as appears at first sight. It is not a re vival of the old restriction on Musatoala in Kuwait Town dropped by the Saudis (vide para 8 of Jedda despatch No.77, dated 25th April 1937, to the Foreign Office) but merely insists on a permit for individuals crossing the frontier for Musabala or other pruposes, not including grazing. My own idea is that Bin Baud will find it difficult to insist on this permit system very strictly, and anyhow the biggest Musabala would be from Saudi tribes who at certain seasons of the year come into Kuwait territory in large numbers for grazing. 5. Whether this provision is put in the Trade Agreement or not seems to me rather academic -sadk if the Shaikh agrees to accept it in the Bon Vois- inage Agreement it will of course be binding on him and affect the Trade Agreement to that extent. intends visiting Bin Baud shortly and any final snags might well be got over by personal and informal inters course between the Shaikh and Bin Saud, as Arab to Arab. My own impression is that it is not Bin Saud himself who raises difficulties so much as some of his entourage i.e. Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Hamza. I think I shall put this proposal up to His Majesty's Govern ment if necessary. 6.

His argument was that the Saudi aovemment would not give permits and there fore this would prevent musahala of this kind, (2) As I understand it the present situation which has lasted ahout a year is that Bin Saud without any public anouncement to that effect has relaxed his 'blockade somewhat 'by allowing persons to come to Kuwait for musa'bala. This point could 'be checked in our next conversation with the Shaikh. (3) I asked the Shaikh in connection with (c) what size of the caravans which might come for musahala was, to which he replied w up to 70 or 80 camels H , This shows that the amount of this kind of musahala is large, and it is, I imagine, 'by these musahala parties that most of the smuggling is carried out. Therefore, from the Saudi point of^view, it is this musahala which has to he checked. (e){do / i / I &gt;a/-*-*- ~j . fk-c /V.

Kuwait. 25th May 1939.Trepislation of letter No.R/6-1181 dated 25th May 1939 from H^H^Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jahir as-Subah, K.C.I.B#, C.S.I. , Ruler of Kuwait, to the Hoi^ble Sir Trenchard Fowle ,KCIE. , CBE#, Politicsal Resident in the Persian Gulf. of the Agreements proposed to be made with the Government of Saudi Arabian Kingdom, i.e., (1) Agreement of Friendship and Bon Voisinage, (2) ibctradition Agreement and (3) Trade or Musabala Agreement. Schedules attached thereto very carefully. It has really become clear to me that all the articles of these Agreements are equitable and indicate mutual confidence. I am very fond of anything that strengthens my relations with my neighbours, especially the Saudi Arabian Kingdom, and it also gives me great pleasure to enter into such agreements if they are in conformity with the wishes of His Majesty's Government. Now I wish to make certain observations summarily and not in detail, as they seem to be essentail for all. (1) Article 1 of the Extradition Agreement says;- T, The Government of Kuwait undertakes to surrender to the Government of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom any perscn in the territory of the Amirate of Kuwait who is a national of the Saudi Arabian iangdom or of a third State and who has committed within the boundaries of that Kingdom any of the crimes mentioned in Article 3.^ (2) The Schedule to the Extradition Treaty, in explaining acts of smuggling, says as follows;- 'If a person in Saudi territory is suspected of having brought in goods from Jiuwait in contravention of the Musabala Agreement between the two Governments and he After Compliments. Reference our conversation on the subject I have studied these Agreements and the escapes/-- a - escapes into territory, the competent authorities in Kunait, on receipt of news thereof, shall arrest the person and seize any goods in his possession. It he is a Kuwait national, the Kuwait authorities shall take the necessary action in regard to him; if he is not a Kuwait national, they shall surrender him to the Saudi authorities with the goods found in his possession.' (3) The penultimate paragraph of Article 6 of the Agreement of Friendship and i3on voisinage contains a sentence similar to that of the Extradition Agreement. (4) The Schedule to the Agreement of Friendship contains the names of the tribes belonging to the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. (5) It is necessary to examine certain stipulations in the Trade Agreement very carefully as they considerably affect the custom and usage observed in the Arabian desert, but at the same time do not oppose the sense of the Agreement; they conflict with the form, and not the sense, of the Agreements. Although i am quite prepared to show leniency, as far as I can, towards my neighbour, the Saudi Arabian Government, i find that it may not be easy to carry out the contents of the articles referred to in my letter, as it is easy and within my power to take action against any person of my subjects if he contravenes the terms of the Agreement and its articles, it is similarly easy to hand over any person who is a national of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom if he commits an aat which is in contravention of the Agreement. But it is very difficult to use this word as a general tern, as the offender might be a national of a third State. Here i wish to know what the proper definition of this^third S6ate t? is. Is this State known? Is it in treaty relations with the Saudi Arabian Government or with me or does it mean a mere Sta te only? Thi s/-% - 5 - This is what refers to articles 1,2,and 3 of this le tt er • As regards Article 4 which deals with the names of tribes, this point is worthy of consideration, as many of these tribes, especially Ajman, Mutair, Rashayeda, Awazim, Tawatihah of Anaza and certain clans of other tribes, dwell in Kuwait territory and are considered to be Jiuwai t subjects and their life is connected with this Amirate economically, materially, politically and morally* As regards Article 5 dealing with Musabala, this article is not free frooi bindings in form nore than in sense. I, therefore, wish them to be modified, as such modification might remove certain difficulties that might stand in the way of some of the poor Arabs who frequent the town either individually or in small groups, to purchase certain necessities for their own living, as the application of a strict commercial regulation to them while they are of no importance, will cause certain complications to the nature of the regulations and arrangements referred to in the said Agreement. My only hope is that my desires may be fulfilled through the help of His Majesty 's Government and your support and the good intention and confidence existing between us» Usual Ending.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

Political Agent, Kuwait, Suttject : Kuwait - Saudi Agreements Reference Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No,832 dated the 9th May 1939, 2, In company with Galloway I have had various conversations with the Shaikh, who raises the following objections, (a) Extradition Agreement Article 1. 'Third State', and other references where the same point arises l,e, letter annexed to Extradition Agreement to define smuggling offences 'if he is not a Kuwait national', Bon Toisinage Agreement Article 6 last paragraph 'if they are not nationals of the country which they . have entered'. Article 12 of the sane treaty 'shall prevent foreigners etc,,', A . ('b) Article 7 of Schedule to Bon Voislnage Agreement, Shailch claims that some elements of tribes enumerated hy Saudi Government as subject to them are in fact subject to him. (c) Article 11 (5) of Bon Voislnage Agreement, see Jedda (Sig telegram S. 44. (Designation)2. telegram No.65 of 17th May to the Foreign Office. The Shaikh was strongly of opinion that individuals coming for musahala should not he required to take out permits. His argument was that the Saudi Government would not give permits and therefore this would prevent musahala of this kind. 3. My comments are as follows. (a) There are also objections from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, vide point (c) in — f&gt;-8 I foreign Office letter No.E.2671/34/24 of 4th May 1939 to the India Office. (h) Prima facie the Saudi Government are certainly in correct in claiming, as they appear to do, all the sections of all the tribes enumerated as 'being subject to them. Some of the tribes and their hahitats are mentioned in Lorlmer's Gazetteer Volume II. This question of suzerainty over tribes is a important one and if the Shaikh were to give up officially and publicly in a treaty his suzerainty over sections of tribes which have always been recognised as being under Kuwait, his prestige would certainly suffer. I do not t hink that he will give in on this point. There would seem to be only two solutions, either for the Saudi Govern ment to drop this clause or for the two parties to come to an agreement over the sections of the tribes subject to them respectively. (c) The present situation, which has lasted about six is, months,/according to information given me by the Shaikh, that Ibn Saud, without any public announce ment to that effect on the subject, has relaxed his /3 &lt;?? liis 'blockade some^iiat 'by allowing his triljesmen to go to Kuwait and other neighbouring States for musabala. This Xbn Saud has done not with any idea of helping Kuwait 'but under pressure from his tribes. The Shaikh naturally wants this situation to continue. 4. The Shaikh told me that it was not Ibn Saud himself who made difficulties hut some of his entourage such as Yusuf Yasin and iruad Hamza, and that if he - the Shaikh - could have a personal interview with Ibn Saud, he could prohahly settle matters with him. I think there is a good deal in this. The Shaikh is visiting Xbn Saud shortly vide my telegram No.T/97*^^ '^2ncL May 1939 and I am of the opinion that the Shaikh should 'be informed that there is no ohjeotion to his having a private and informal conversation with Ihn Saud on subjeots (h) and (o) ahove, (a) 'being reserved for consideration hy His Majesty's Government. (The subject of the Agreements will, I imagine, in any case come up in the course of conversations 'between the two Rulers). I would 'be grateful for a telegram as soon as possible authorising this communication. I suggest that Ibn Saud 'be not informed of this as any commun ication to this effect would have to go through either Tusuf Xasin or Fuad Hamza who, I am afraid, would then do their 'best to prevent any concessions 'by Ibn Saud.

I enclose copies of my letter to the Shaikh and his reply. 3. The Shaikh's reply contains materially the same views as he expressed to you himself. 4. My 'brief comments are as follows: Paragraph 2 of Shaikh # s reply: (a) SulDaihiyah is situated on the main road to the south and (h) Jahra on the road to Biyadh. These two places, in the Shaikh^ opinion, are the only places practicable because of the lack of sweet water elsewhere. Paragraph 5 (viii) of the Shaikh # s reply: The Shaikh's point is that if the traders import sufficient goods there will he no incentive for the Bedouin to smuggle, and therefore no need to restrict their movements. The Shaikh is adamant that no restrictions should 'be placed on the Bedouin, whereas the Saudis will apparently insist (vide para- ^ /&gt; hi graph 4 or enclosure 1 to Jedda despatch No. 51 of the 19th (Signature) March/ . 44. Designation)March, 1959) that they must conform to a regulation. Whatever the Shaikh # s motives may he, and I daresay he does not think that the value of trade to he brought 'by the merchants will compensate for the loss of Sedouin traffic brought ahout 'by restricting their movements, to impose restrictions on the Bedouin would he most difficult in practice. Bin Saud himself has had to lift the blockade unofficially, and for these reasons alone the Shaikh's insistance on the free movement of the Bedouin is, I think, sound. Shaikh's paragraph 5 (x) is a fresh ohjeotion trntthe Saudis * /tfl ^ ^ are not insistant on this amendment (vide paragraph (11) enclosure 2 to Jedda despatch No. 51 of 19th March, 1939). Shaikh's paragraph 6 (i). This is a reversion to the original wording. ^ h Shaikh's paragraph 6 (iii). I have attempted to get chap ter and verse for the Shaikh's statenient, 'but can get nothing comprehensive and conclusive. What does emerge is (a) that the Eashiyada are still 'servants' of the Shaikh and (b) the Awazim were 'servants', 'but ahout two thirds gave their allegiance to Bin Saud during the Jkhwan movement. The remaining third are the fishermen of Kuwait and inhabitants of the islands, (c) The Ajman and Mutair have likewise mostly gone over to Bin Saud. Shaikh's paragraph 7 (i) last sentence. The Shaikh's sti pulation to consult His Majesty's Government is new. I think we need not take up this point now as it is proposed hv the - ib.ffv Foreign Office (vide paragraph 3 (i) of loreign Office letter No. E.2671/34/25 of the 4th May, 1939) to omit or correct the article. When this has been done the matter can he exolained to the Shaikh. Political Agent, Kuwait./&gt;0 Political Agancy, UO.C/S67.

I have the honour to refer to our conversation on the subjeot of the Saudi Government draft of the Trade, Bon Voisinage and Bztradition agrecaents , of sfcioh I have given you copies, ■between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and to enumerate and ask Your Highness' aoceptance, or otherwise, as you deem fit, of certain alterations and insertions by the Saudi Arabian Authorities in modific- i I ation of the drafts already agreed upon by Your Highness. 2. So far as the Trade agreement is concerned, no change has been made in the drafting but nevertheless certain points have yet to be settled. I The first is that of the frontier posts. The Saudi Government propose to establish by land (a) Al Ojarya (b) Hafr, and by sea (a) Bas Tannura (b) Jubail (c) Qatif (d) UJair, and I should be grateful if Your Highness would let me know what post you propose to establish.# 3 * 3. The secona Is that of the definition of 'oarwan'. The Saudi Government propose that one aotor- vehicle, or three suairaals, should constitute a caravan. The figures are lo», hut that would see® to he all to tfce good as then no individual should have to wait long before a 'caravan' would assemble and he he ahle to proceed with it, 4. THat is all for the Trade agreement except for the aooeptanee of a preamble, this will follow the lines of the preamble of the other two greeiaents. Presumably to this Tour Highness has no objection. 5. As regards the Bon Yoisinage .greeraent ooasiderabl® changes have been proposed nd on these, which I will explain below, 1 should be grateful for Your Highness' remarks, U) The preamble has been modified in language, bit no material alteration made in the sense. (ii) Article 1 has been remodelled to read as one article. (iii) In rticle (6) the wording has been slightly altered and the words 'warning must be given in addition to the nearest official aM, in case of its being impossible to reach him, to t e persons or tribes threatened' have been inserted. I i- 3 - (lv) In article (6) toe word 'ssug.glinfc* has 'boen inserted. This has been considered necessary the Saudi GoTernaent so as to oover the intent of the agreeaent, i.e., the prevention of sawggling *hioh has, in the past, been a oause of diffei'siKse between the two countries. {■r) 'iTticle (7) has heen recast since the Saudi Crovemraent hold that such matters as are dealt with in article (7) have, in the past, ha en dealt srito under the Sharia and that no reference to usages and customs is necessary. *' (Ti) Article 7 - (3) has heen deleted as having, in practice in like oirctastances elsewhere, heen found unnecessary. . (vii) Article 15 of the Kuwait draf has oeen deleted and its tonas includ- ed more concisely in a resaodel of article 8, which no® provides for a reference to the two contracting parties in such cases as the frontier officials cannot settle. (viii) In article 9 the words 'or lusahala* have heen omitted and new conditions of travel for those persons hent on 'Musahala' inserted in article 11 (S) of the new draft. (ix) Two sub paragraphs have s-asssw«» 4 *■ been added to ajfticle 9,(2)4esllng with the liflpoBltion of restriotions by frontier offioials in oerfealn olrciaBtanoes ani, (3} for the free aoreamt of certain authorised offioials into to© territory of the other country to collect, for example, akat. (x) The following words have 'Vi oeen added to article 10 'imiesa the approval of the other Govern?aent has been obtained beforehand''. The Saudi Goveraaent state that they have aad this Insertion in the interests of Your Highness, *ho, they believe, employs a number of Saudi nationals. (xi) Article 11 in its new fona is intended to cover all eases of crossing the frontier. Your Highness will sea that free crossing for the ! hunter is not provided for as His Majesty Abdul Asiz does not wish to make exceptions in writing, though he wiild have no objection actually and to vfhioh effect he has sent word to His Jajesty's Hinister at Jedda. (xii) Paragraph (2) of article 11 provides for the Journeys of official aassengers between Kuwait and iiiyadh and merely regularises a practice already working well. —(lii) m artiole 7 of the schedu e the Saudi GoverruaeQt have added ® list of the trl'ees whion Us®y olala are auhject to their Oovsrnmant, It is aow suggested toat a list of the tribes subjeet tu four Highness should he giTQa. ^ ^ -6 ^ {if) ^ ooaplete paragraph has h«9B aMed hy the Saudi whioh provides for whet otlon he taken by a peraon in searoh of lost property. * 7. the Extradition greeoent has heen altered in so;^® rsspeots these alterations in tha amin are:, (i) in articles one whio.j provide for the surrender of personagse the words 'of third State* have been inserted. Your Highness is already fully aware of the import of tljeae words and I have only to add that the British Government is also aware that these words require amending, (11) The list of the offences for whioh extradition may ha requested has been slightly altered, hut only with the object of definition for the benefit of the Sharia Courts, iurthar eluoidatioa as regards Bedouins is provided in tm mmxedletters. Smuggling has been added eM action to be tasen in the event of a case arisln.- set forth in anaexures. itwill 1)6 see that extradition is only applicaMe to non-Kuwaiti subjects for such offences. (ill) The Saudi Government have a proposed the excision of article 4(2) of the old draft as they claim that their form of administration does not lend itself to the placing of a seal 'by the competent authority on a demand for extradition. Further they state since the demand will come from one or other of the two Governments who I' will 'be responsible for the matter, seals on individual documents are of no importanoe. (iv) Your Highness will see that ' ve after article four a new artaole iiad *been inserted 'by the Saudi authorities wiilcii provides for a speedy communication 'between the two Governments when a fugitive is 'being pursued.

The posts I suggest for eatahlishcaent on the Kuwait side ire: hy land (a) Suhaihiyah (h)Jahra, and hy sea (a)Kuwait port. 3, I have no objection to the definition of the 'caravan' as suggested, provided that caravans consist of recognised merchants only and trader® only with their following, 4, I have no objection to a preamble provided that in substance it is the same as the preambles for the Bon Vcisinage and Extradition agreements, 5. 7ith regard to the Bon Voisimge Treaty: (i) I note the alteration in the preamble and have no objection, (ii) 1 agree to the alterations in article one, (iii) I have no objection to the addition of a phrase regarding warning, (iv) I have no objection to the inclusion of smuggling as one of the offenoes against which action may be taken, though smuggling should automatically cease/-. g . /&gt;« cease on the conoluslon. of the egreements. (v) 1 agree to the alterations. (vi) I hare no otojaction to the alteration. (Tii) I have ao ohjaction to the change made. ^ (viii) I 4© not agree to the exclusion of the word 'Musahals- 1 from article 9 and I wish the Saudi Government draft to he modified. Unless it is laodified to permit trioeamea and poor Arabs to cross the frontier the purpose of riuaahala sitner in large or smll groups or individually free of all rastricfciona I thlifls: great hardship will he their let, I do not desire to he a party to the imposiiiion upon the wandsring people strict coiaaerolal regulations and the necessity of moving many miles out of their -vay to ohtain papers tne iseaning of which will he ohscure to tham. The Bedouins already have free access to ay territory and T do not wish to upset that. That I want la for traders also to come, though helag acre conversant with affairs they can obtain documents and thus -/e shall prevent SPtuggliag. (Ix) I have no ohj action to this amenditient as 1 have previously penaitted tax collectors from 3audi Arabia to enter ay territory and collect iakat. (x) I cannot agree to this article. I wish that it aay he omitted or modified to read that hoth the Saudi APaMan and Kuwaiti Oovemaents can employ the subjects of one another Governaent in their respective armed forces etcetera. (si) As His Majesty King Abdul Aziz has given his wore to the British MiniHter in Jedda that there is no objection to hunting parties crossing the frontier I aa quite content that no mention of the matter should be made in the Treaty, (xil) I have no objection. (xiii) I have already given in paragraph (vili) above my desires in the matter of 'Musabala', Of course pllgrlas should/-should 'be exeapto-i from all restrlotlous, ( x I t ] I agree to the alteration. 6. (1) I agree to the fedraftiag of this article, tot I thins the aeanlag should not he rostrioted to camels. The word 'aniaals' should he inserted instead, (ii) I have no ohjection. (ill) 1 notice that the Saudi Sovermsnt have inserted the naraes of all the tribes inhahiting lorth AraMa M coming unfler 3audl dosainion no» this is not as it should he for the riashayida people are ay people and nearly all asahers of that tribe live in ay territory. This is a well known fast and I collect &lt;akat fross this tribe and ray fore-fathers have done so before me, even as they and I have done with regard to at least one third of the Awasia tribe. Of all the tribes aientioned la article seven of the schedule certain members asell In ay territory, and those people are subject to and I cannot agree that it he laid do.-.n in an agreement that they are not subject to ma, {iy) i nave no objection. 7&gt; (i) how ay objections to this are that although I am quite prepared to snow leniency, as far as I oan, towards ay neighbour, the Saudi Arabian Govonaaesxt, I find that it say not b® easy to carry out the contents of the articles referred to, but it is easy and within ay power to taics action against any person of ay subjects if he contravenes the terms of tne Agjpaeaeat and its articles. It is similarly easy to hand over any person who is « national of the 3audi Arabian Kingdom If ha oomits an act whioh is in contravention of the Agreement. But it is very difficult to use this word as a general term, as the offander might be a national of a third State. Here 1 wish to know what the/-- 4 - / 3d the proper definition of this Hiiird State n ia. Is this State knOvint Is it in Treaty relations with tiie Saudi iraMan Goverament or with me or does it mean a mere State only? I wish to do all in my power towards the stoppage of ofrenoes 'but I cannot undertake, owing to my Treaty with His Majesty^ Government, to deliver the subjeots of a third State to tne Saudi AraMan GoTeroment unless of course they be of a neighbouring Moslem State, this I oan agree to do after consulting His Majesty f s GoYerniaent. (ii) I have no objection to the teruB of the redraft. (iii) I have no objeetion to this proposal though it is an irsb custom to sign end. seal also all documents. (iv) I have no objection to this.

'MuBabala 11 is of course the crux# The Saudi side of the question as.I understand it is given /i/j in paragraph 3 of ny Express latter So.903-S, dated the iotn December 1936. 'Jfhe Shaikh, in his present letter, produces no fresh arguments but the real reason for his attitude is /• rl probably that given in paragraph 3 (o) of my Express Letter Ho.0/226, dated the 27th Hay 1939. W« are therefore now back at the old deadlock on this point, ihe only way out of this deadlock, so far as 1 can see, is the suggestion of the Shaikh ^ P'ML - contained in my Bxpress Letter of the 18th Dececiber 1936 quoted above. As the Saudis are now pressing for the con clusion of the Agreements it is possible that they may accept this solution. faraKraph 5 (ix) . Ho comment. ParanJaph 5 (x) . I can only suggest that the Shaikh 's views be conveyed to the Saudi Government. There is no Nationality Law in Kuwait and so the national status of many of the inhabitants of Kuwait is doubtful. Amongst this class are large mmbers of individuals whom both the Shaikh and the Saudi Cover rime nt might claim as their nationals and it is possible that some of these are in the Shaikh's employ. It is probably from a desire to avoid raising this awkward question of nationality generally that the Shaikh objects to this Article. with regard to the Political Agent's remarks on this point. The fact that the Saudis do not insist on the amendment does not help us since the Shaikh objects to the whole of the Article. If the ameudment was dropped the / Shaikhil&gt; Shaikh oould then employ any of the doubtful class roentioned above, who, in his opinion, was not a Saudi national* If however at this stage it was suggested to the Saudis that the axaendiaent should be dropped I imagine they would become suspicious# Paragraph 5 (xi) * This is satisfactory# Paragraph 5 (xii).

On the £8th morning His Highness called on me, and told me that he had decided to visit Ibn Saud. He said that he would go hawking in two or three days 1 time, and would go straight on as he did not wish anyone to Imow of his intention before he had actually left. He left Kuwait during that night, and the next morning sent back for his retinue and Nafisi. At the same time he sent a message to shaikh Abdulla Salim telling him that he had gone to Riyadh. I am told that His Highness himself proposed the visit to Bin saud, and that Bin Saud sent a letter by a special messenger towards the end of Ramadhan expressing his acquiescence. 3. As His Highness made such a mystery of the whole affair, combined with the fact that I am watching special ly for any mention of Kuwait affairs on the Berlin Radio, I did not send the news to London for the Arabic Broad cast. I propose to follow the same course regarding His Highness f s return to Kuwait. K ae Hon'ble Lieut-Col. C.G.

(R begins) Sheikh's main objection is to addition of words to Article ^ h £(* 11 (5) or Bon Voisinage agreement, making it impossible for a national of either party to enter the territory of the other for the purpose of 'Musabala 11 without first obtaining permission from the authorities of his own country, and to the proposed ^ j) (nh* f* *1*+ corresponding provision in Article 9 of the Trade Agreement. He insists that it is impossible for nomads to obtain documents every time they wish to enter Koweit to make purchases. (R ends) He repeats offer to guarantee to exercise a personal check on all purchases made by Bedouins. Do you see any prospect of per suading Ibn Saud to drop his proposal on this basis? 2. (R begins) ,p.- Second objection is to Article 10 of Bon Voisinage Agreement. Sheikh would prefer that both Governments should have the right to employ nationals of the other in their armed forces. 3. Sheikh also objects to the list of Saudi tribes in ^ ' I V Article 7 of the schedule to Bon Voisinage Agreement. He claims that certain elements of these tribes are his subjects. This article seems out of place in such an agreement and could very well be omitted. 4. His Majesty's Government for their part wish to omit the words '^or of a third state' from Article 1 etc. , of the Extradition/-2~ Extradition Agreement. Sheikh does not exercise jurisdiction over the nationals of all third states and it would be impossible for him to undertake to extradite persons over whom he has no jurisdiction. 5.

I see no objection to the omission of the words 'in their own name' from the preambles to the AgreementSo I cannot, however, accept the Saudi Arabian proposal that the Agreements should be drawn up in Arabic only. It is essential that there should be an English text of any agreement which is signed on behalf of His Majesty 1 s Government and which will subsequently be published as a White Paper, There is no analogy between these agreements and the Bon Voisinage Agreement of 1933 with Transjordan, to which His Majesty's Government were not a party. /Se Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G,, G,I.E., etc., etc,, J edda,3, Many drafting amendments have been made to which there is no reference in the notes. For example, the words ''between the respective territories' have 'been omitted from the preamble to the Agreement for Friendship and Neighbourly Relations, since it seems sufficient to say that good relations exist between the rulers and their families. I do not, however, wish to cause difficulties over questions of phraseology and you may at your discretion adopt in such matters any form of 'words which you consider necessary to meet the Saudi Arabian point of view* 4. It appears that the most serious point still outstanding is the question of 'Musabala'. The Sheikh's objection that it is impossible for Bedouin to obtain documents from the Saudi Arabian authorities every time they wish to cross the frontier into Kowei. territory seems reasonable, - it must at any rate be difficult for them to do soj and I trust that you will be able to induce the Saudi Arabian Government to abandon their insistence on this provision, 5.

The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (herein after called the Government of the United Kingdom), acting on behalf of His Highness the Sheikh of Koweit, of the one part, and the Government of Saudi Arabia, of the other part, being desirous of concluding an Agreement to regulate trade between Koweit and Saudi Arabia, have appointed as their Representatives for this purpose: who, having examined their credentials and found them to be in good and due form, have agreed as follows: Article 1 . (1) All goods which leave Koweit territory for Saudi Arabia by land or sea must be accompanied by a person carrying a manifest«r ? manifest. In the case of goods sent by land: (a) they must be sent by caravan, and any person carrying goods from Koweit territory who is not with a caravan shall be regarded as a smuggler, even if he has a manifest; (b) the caravan must call at that one of the points in Saudi Arabia mentioned in Article 7 below which is specified in the manifest; (c) the person carrying the manifest must also have with him a list showing the names of the persons in the caravan and the number of camels; (d) the person carrying the manifest shall report to the officials appointed for that purpose first at the Koweit point and then at the Saudi Arabian point specified in the manifest. (2) Persons entering Koweit territory from Saudi Arabia and leaving again with goods bought for their personal consumption, whether they are nomad or settled, must travel in parties and conform to the conditions laid down for commercial caravans. (3) Goods which leave Koweit territory foribo for Saudi Arabia by sea must be taken to the Saudi Arabian port specified in the manifest, and the person holding the manifest must report to the proper authorities at that purt. The provisions about smuggling contained in the present regulations shall be applicable to goods transported by sea and to the persons transporting them. (4) A caravan shall consist of not less than one motor vehicle or three animals. Article g . The person responsible for a caravan or party such as is mentioned in Article 1 shall, before his departure with the caravan (or party) and with the goods from Koweit territory for Saudi Arabia, obtain a manifest from the Koweit Customs Department (Manifest Office) for all the goods destined for Saudi Arabia. This manifest must accompany the goods, and a copy of it shall be given to the Saudi Arabian Trade Agent in Koweit by the Koweit/&amp;&gt;! Koweit Customs Office before the caravan (or party) leaves Koweit territory, and a third copy of the manifest shall be kept in the Manifest Office. It is forbidden to take a quantity greater or less than that shown in the manifest or to go to any destination other than that mentioned in the manifest or by any route other than the ordinary one. Article 5 .

The interests of Kuwait, in my opinion, would hest he served hy the re-insertion of the word musaftala in paragraph 9 of the Bon Voisinage Treaty (entailing amendments in other places) and the Bedouin of Northern AraMa he free to roam at will. (2) Enlistment . I anticipate no difficulty on this score. (3) List of trihes . There is no one whole trite residing in Kuwait and the Shaikh can only reasonably claim individuals of certain trihes as his subjects as already stated in paragraph 6 (iii) of Shaikh of Kuwait's letter No. B/6-1213 of the 11th July, 1939.

As for the Bedouin proper, it may be possible to list those Mio are in Kuwait territory, hut to do so now during a drought Tehen many tribes have moved southwards would only result in a list detrimental to Kuwait interests. In my opinion, the appendix of a B.Y.Treaty is not wtiere the settlement of the question of the overlordship of the tribes should find place, and the appendix should be omitted. Beyond the above it is impossible to work a system of permxts for Bedouin unless their nationality has first been settled, and, as the question of nationality and Bin Baud's suggestion are concomitant W the reinsertion of musabala _ 1- —— — m article 9 of the B.T.

This solution would involve omission of;- ^ 4b- /£!«•/&amp; ^ (i). Article 9 of Trade Agreement ^ IT' (ii). the words 'or Musabala' of Bon voisinage agreement, and ... ,6-m- (iii). Article 11 (5) of that agreement. Please consider this suggestion which would presumably be acceptable at any rate to the shaikh. (b) Enlistment. This saems to offer no difficulty. - r/ j&gt; Foreign Office suggest that it would be best to omit Article 10 of Bon voisinage agreement entirely. K r ' (o) List of tribes. Suggestion that shaikh might make list of tribes claimed as his subjects (paragraph No.6 of Jedda telegram) might be adopted. (d)./%)&gt; (d) Jurisdiction. Insertion ot words ^or ot a third Arab State' v f ^ j in Article 1 and 2 of Extradition agreement is approved, and should be satisfactory. 1 kope that , in consultation with the Shaikh, you will be able to advance the matter so as to facilitate reference to Ibn Saud while at Mecca, -RETAXANDUM-^ • ssffh - aa/G4 Telegram i'rom Political Agent, Kuwait To Political Resident, Bushire Ho.G/14 I&gt;ated ibth received 16 tti January 1940 Am keeping pending your arrival long telegram addressed to you from London regarding Saudi agreements• PoliticalArt.lQ&gt; The Shaikh does not want this restriction regarding employment of the other party's nationals (paragraph 6(x) of the Shaikh's letter)• P.A.Kuwait states (paragraph 4 p.119) that the Saudis are not insistent on this amendment, but the amendment was in the Shaikh's favour. The original Article (Vol.D-143 p.157) entirely prohibits such employment. So thisobjection of the Shaikh is likely to cause difficulty. It would seem that the Shaikh is on weak ground here. Art.11(5) . The Shaikh repeats (paragraph 5 (xiii) of his letter) his objection to restriction on 'Musabala'. 1^* ^0 ) f 1 A The Schedule . Araif . The Shaikh (paragraph 6(i) of his letter) wants the word 'animals' substituted for the word 'camels' in the Saudi draft. T he Schedule - Article 7 . Naming of tribes subject to each party. The Shaikh (paragraph 6(iii) of his * h f 11 'I letter) objects to the Saudi List but has not made any clear statement of the tribes of sections he claims. p.u.c. may be forwarded to India Office with reference 4 r? C &gt; lLcX*-tv- /a Jo /' 0 . |i2 //, / Finally we come to the draft Extradition Agreement and in this the Shaikh (paragraph 7(i) of his letter) - ^ ri 1 objects to the inclusion in Articles 1 and 2 of the _ ^ (&amp;Q, 'nationals of a third State.' As the P.A. has pointed out the Foreign Office (p.82 (i)) considered that Kuwait ^ cannot agree to surrender of nationals of a third State. ^ jb'/i*) i^I 4</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ed_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/520</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001ed</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/520</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/54 VII (D 150) Kuwait Blockade'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1940</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-28T10:51:51</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (227 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>Condition: A bound correspondence volume.Foliation: The file's main foliation sequence commences at the title page and terminates at the last folio; these numbers are written in pencil, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
