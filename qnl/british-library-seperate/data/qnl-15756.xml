                           thawbor shirt and a patterned headdress/turban. He appears to be blind or partially sighted in his left eye.The three men are photographed in a courtyard-like space with foliage visible in the background.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded quality in places, in particular, the shirt of the man at centre.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XXPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Pilger aus Baẖrain; in der Mitte ein Schēch aus Kabul.’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower right corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000011#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
