He told me that His Excellency the Consul-Oeneral proposes to ask Major Dawson to see the Mutasarrif and settle the matter with him and that he hopes that the case will be seotled soon. I received a letter today from our agent at Fao saying that when he asxed the Kudir Aa-Nahya to instruct the Falaheen to give us our share of Sa f af (date palm leaves) he told him to wait until he, the Mudir would meet the Qayem-Makam. The Mudir went to Abul Khaseeb and met the Cayem-Makam and returned back to Fsa Fao. He then told our agent that the Oayem-Makam has told him that the Falaheen were refusing to give the Sa'af and the case between the landlord and the Falaheen was in the Court and that they could not force the falaheen at the present until the case is settled.

CON FID ENT I / L Kuwait Receipt No DatedTranslation of letter dated the 20th January, 1944, from the Lawyer Islander Mansur, Basrah, to Shaikh Mohd. Ahmed al Jabir As-Subah, Basrah. / f Jf After Compliments, Regarding the appealing case between His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir As-3ubah and the heirs of Abdul Baqi Az-Zuhair abouo the question of the recovery of the purchasing money of Al-Bashiya. I wish to inform you that I went to Baghdad on 15th ins cant and have returned bacjt to Basrah today. I have discussed the above mentioned question with Nasrat al Farisi and when the question^was fully discussed and made the necessary comments, I accompanied him to the Court of Appeal, on the 13th instant. I have the pleasure to inform you that the Court, after hearing the plea and counter-plea, put the following question to the lawyer of the heirs of Abdul Baqi Az-Zuhair:- ,r .7ho had had the free hand in the shares of the heirs of Abdul Baqi Az-Zuhair since the date of the private transaction upto the decision of the Land Settlement Committee was reached? ,t It is quite evident from this question, that the Court of Appeal has agreed and confirmed my opinion that the time barred should began with the date of the ceasing of the free hand in Al-Bashiya property and not with the date of the document, i.e. 1327 Hijrya, as it was agreed upon by Basrah Court of 1st Instance, who rejected the suit filed by me claiming that the case was time barred. The purpose of this ouestion is to point out the beginning of the time barred, after the ceasing of the free hand and as His ' Highness Shaikh Ahmed As-Subah T s free hand was ceased in 1938, the^time barred did not occure, because the fifteen years have not expired in 1938. It has therefore, became quite assured that a decision has been passed by the Court of Appeal to the effect that the judgement of the Court of 1st Instance was to be cancelled and to enter the bases of the case and to pa-s a decree that the price of sale, claimed in this case should be returned. The lawyer of the heirs of Abdul Baqi Az-Zuhair did not give his reply to the question addressed to him by the Court. He asked that the original copy of the document of sale should be oroduced and that he should be given time to refer the matter to his clients. The Court postponed the case to Tuesday 8th February, 1944 so that the original copy of the abovementioned document be produced • and the Lawyer of the deirs will reply the question of the Court . Till ORICIN OF THB DCCUIIFNT OF SALE . /hen I was appointed as the lawyer in this case, I asked for ohe oiiginal copy of the oocument regarding the sale of the shares of Abdul Baqi Az-Zuhair of the Bashiya property, which were sold by Abdul Wahab al Kartas and the document was dated 14th Ramadhan ' 1327 Hijrya. But you gave me a countersigned copy of the said ' document and as the copy of the document was given by Settlement Committee, I examined all the files of the settlement carefully, but did not find the original document, and when it was necessary to ask for the seizure of the shares of Bashiya, after the decision i issued by the Court of Tamyeez, which hao contained the sanction of the decree of the Court of Appeal of Settlement, I produced the countersigned copy of the said document and obtained a decision from the Court of 1st Instance in Basrah, ordering the execution by the way of security of the a orementioned shares. It is very important to produce the Xk original document of sale, as without producing it, it will be very hard to obtain the decision oo recover the value of sale. I shall do my utmost in referring the matter to the Chief of the Courts to pursue the original copy of the document. It is possible that the original copy of this document might be in Kuwait. I therefore request you to Kindly request His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir As-Subah to • order/order the oerase of ahe said document and to have it sent to Basrah urgently.

D.O. No. 6/146 of February 23rd^^ ^ Since iny let.ter of September 16th to Hickinbotham the case has run the following course. . On Sex^tember 19th, 1943? the Mutasarrifiyah confirmed by letter that the situation as to the ownership of the date gardens had better remain for the time being in statu guo , and stated that it was judged best to appoint a committee consisting of members from the fellaheen’s party, the Sheikh of Kuwait's party and Govern ment officials. The letter suggested that it be explained to the fellaheen that they should either hand over the crop to the owner or take the responsibility of guarding it. The Mutasarrifiyah had been expecting Sheikh. Mohammed Al-Sabah to get in touch with the Mudir of Fao and select two members to represent the Sheikh of Kuweit. 3. On September 24 th, 1943, the Consulate-General informed the Mutasarrifiyah, with reference to the above letter,.that it would be glad to receive statistics regarding the quantity of dates already harvested and the estimated quantity of the total crop. These figures would then be forwarded to the Political Agent, Kuwait, for the information of the Sheikh* 4. On October 26th the Hutasarrifiyah informed the Consulate- General tfrat estimates had been drawn up by the Committee. These estimates amounted to 12,724 manns (954*300 tons). The Mutasarrif iyah added that other quantities, not included in the estimate,.had been sold direct by Sheikh Mohammed Al-Sabah to the farmers. A copy of the letter in the original Arabic is attached. 5. The estimate of 12,724 manns was presumed.at this Consulate- General to cover three date-bearing areas, North, South and Centre. Sheikh Mohamned had meanwhile given the Consulate-General his own estimate of the Southern area only, which stood, as at August 17th, 1943, at 24,330 manns - t double the amount the Mutasarrif iyah' s estimate gave for all three areas. An estimate, as at October 9th, 1943, for the Southern area alone, said to have been produced by the Government Committee but coming to us from Sheikh MohammecL,showed an amount of 8,125 manns. . 6 . In view of all these discrepancies the Consulate-General wrote to the Mutasarrif iyah on December 21st asking for details of* the yield of the various holdings the total yield of which amounted to the figure of 12,724 manns, given by the Mutasarrifiyah. At the same time the Consulate-General asked for the names of the x^ersons who sat on behalf of the Sheikh of Kuwait on the committee which produced the estimate of 12,724 manns. The Consulate-General also sought information as to the disijosal of the .'Sa'af' (date palm branches), which it understood had not that year been given up to the owner. 7.. At. this point your letter of December 13th regarding 'Sa'af' arriyed, on the subject of which the Consul-General has addressed to you to-day a separate official letter. /On C. «T.

The rest of the letter regards 'Sa’af' and has been coimnunicated to you in the Consul-General’s official letter referred to in paragraph seven.Cl^Y OF EXTRACT OF a LRTTiiR ADDR^SS^D TB THE i.IUTARARRIFIYAH of BAoRA LI^A,BASRA, No.3252 (24/1/1) dated 27th December,1943. M .... information has reached the Ruler of Kuwait regarding the removal of palm leaves from His Highness' date gardens at Fao. , According to this information, the Ru*Ler's agent st Fao asked the Hudir-an-Nahiya to order the Fellaheen there to yield up to the Ruler His Higness' share of 'sa'af' (date palm leaves),but was told tp wait until the Ludir should see the Qain-Lacan. The L’udir having consulted the Caim- Ilaqam, informed the Ruler's agent that according to the Qaim-Racam the Fellaheen refused to give up the'sa'af', that a case was pending in law between the owner of the date gardens and the Fellaheen, and that the Fellaheen could not be compelled to give up the palm leaves pending the settlement of the case. It is not clear to this Consulate-General whether the legal proceedings referred to above concern the allocation of dates, which has been the subject of recent correspondence between the Rutasarrifiyah and this Consulate-General, or whether they constitute a separate suit concerning only the ownership and allocation of 'sa'af'. This Consulate-General would, in any case, be grateful for early information as to the truth of the allegation that the Ruler of Kuwait's agent has been prevented from removing the palm leaves, and, as to the reason for this action, if it was indeed taken. 'OCPY OF CF XjjLWii' UP ki jD ci 1\ ix Pi AjjD R .«j -B ,-B —j J. 0 '13 (24/1/1) IB IUTA3ARRIFIYAH lated 2nd February,1944: 2. In the course of this correspondence tv/o separate, though related, subjects have been treated. These are : a) the reruest that the fruit of the gardens be safeguarded pending a decision as to the respective shares which the Ruler of Kuwait-and the Fellaheen could properly claim, b) the cuestion of the truth of the allegation that the Ruler of Kuwait’s agent has been prevented from removing the palm leaves and the reason for any such action. 3. To take a) first. In the letter of the Mutasarrifiyah under reply it is stated that the object first arrived at by the Consulate-General in this connexion was to induce the Fellaheen at Fao to render to the Ruler of Kuwait the share of dates due to His Highness. In the view of His Britannic Lajesty’s Consulate-General, however, this statement does not fully reflect the facts as given in the letter,No.2442 of September 13th, 1943, from the Consulate-General on the subject 4. Reference was made in that letter to a conversation at which the Mutasarrif, the Deputy Mutasarrif and Major Dov/son were present. It appeared that in the legal action regarding the date gardens the Fellaheen had entered an appeal but that a final decision had not yet been given. The Mutasarrif was understood, however, to have expressed the opinion that he could make use of his administrative powers to let things remain as before pending the decision of the Courts. 5. It appeared further that the Fellaheen were harvesting the date crop, and the matter was regarded as extremely urgent. The Consulate-General asked whether the Mutasarrifiyah could consider the poss ibility of giving effect to the Mutasarrif’s views as referred to above. 6 . The Mutasarrifiyah by its letter No.17033 of September 19th,1943, confirmed that the situation had better remain as before and that the Fellaheen should either hand over the crop to the lawful owner or take the responsibility of guarding it 7. It follows that the first aim of the Consulate-General, therefore, was to safeguard the crop, pending a decision regarding the shares. 8 . It is not clear to the Consulate-General what is meant x by the Mutasarrifiyah's statement: but the Consulate-General considers that this may refer to a decision understood to have recently been given in the Courts in favour of the Ruler of Kuwait. 9. Conseouently, the estimate of the crop becomes of primary importance. The Mutasarrifiyah in its letter No.19256 of October 26th, 1943, gave this estimate as 12,724 mann, understood by the Consulate-General to be the total estimate for the Northern, Central and Bouthern Areas. The Consulate- General, however, in its letter No.3209 of December 21st,1943, recuested that it might kindly be furnished with details, in respect of each holding, of this official estimate. A list of the holdings is attached to the present letter, and the Consulate-General v/ould still be grateful for a reply on this point, which it ventures to hope v/ould not be covered by the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior precluding action by the Mutasarrifiyah in the matter. P.T.G.To come to the second subject dealt with in this correspondence, regarding 'oa’af', treated in the letters of the Consulate-General No.32C9 of December 21st and No.3252 of December 27th, 1943, the Consulate-General notes that it will be informed of the Ministry's views, and would esteem it a favour to receive an early reply. 'BRITISH GOITSULATE-GME^L BASRA. 9 th Harch 1944 * Kuwait Receipt Ao &gt;3c&gt;7 Dated 3 07 Dated CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL Kuwait Receipt You will see from our official and semi-official letters of to-day’s date that we have not 'been idle in the matter of the Sheikh’s date gardens at pao. I fear, however, that the results of past and any future correspondence with the Liutasarrifiya on this subject can be but meagre, even apart from the fact thet the Mutasarrifiya considers itself for the time being estopped by the attitude of the Ministry of the Interior from taking any active interest in the matter. 2. I can see that the mere fact that the Consulate-General has intervened on behalf of the Sheikh of Kuwait may produce some good effect, but the subject is so complicated and difficult for the uninitiated that it is to be hoped that Sheikh Mohammad will succeed in unravelling the ^ngled skein by his own efforts as far as possible.

These disputes in the Pao gardens would not, I think, arise if the Kuwait title in them were firmly established and not open to attack by lawyer inspired fellaheen . This devoutly to be wished consummation seems to have been brought a step nearer by the recent decision of the Court of Land Settlement in favour of the Al-Subah. It remains to be seen whether it will leave a loophole for the interminable law suits beloved of the Asiatic. I fear it will. Yours sincerely Zc_ A.T.

I have received no information from Ustadh NasraV al-Faresi,the lawyer regarding the result of the Appeal. Usual Bndin^.Translation of the decision of the Jourt of Appeal. 1. As the result of careful examination and discussion, it has appeared that the sale of the shares, which are the^cause of the case, took place outside the Tapo office and was not registered in due time. 2. And whereas i. the document of sale does not itself facilitate a decision, and its cancellation requires no judicial decision ii. the buyer, according to the document has the right to claim the return of the amount paid by him since the date of the document iii. the buyer has not exercised this right since that date i.e. 14 Ramadhan 1327 iv. the document has long become time-barred v. the alleged disposal of shares exercised according to the document does not affect the essentials of the case nor ios real point, nor does it estop the running of time (against the appellants) since it was not exercised within the framework of the law. 3. And as the alleged absence (of the appellants) cannot be taken into consideration for want of proof since the lawyers of the appellants were present in Basrah therefore the judgement appealed against rejecting the original suit as time-barred was according to law. 4. Valid pleadings justifying acceptance of this appeal have not therefore been furnished and it has been decided not to accept (those offered) and to up hold the judgement appealed against it and cause the appellant to pay the expenses of the case and the wages of the lawyer of the appellee for two sessions. The expenses are I.D.13/- and I.D.11/250 for the reply. The judgement was passed legally and in agreement on 4th May, 1944. M EM B R R 3. President . Bregard. Hasan Sami Aref Sweidi.

Now that the heirs of Abdul Baqi have succeeded in having ohe case in their favour, the Lawyer says that he has discussed the question v/ith Nasrat Al-L risi the Lawyer, Baghdad and that Nasrat Al-Farisi prefers to carry on with the case till the end as Your Highness can make out from his letter attached herewith.

This case was left for reconsidera tion until the final decision in the suit filed by me against the heirs of Abdul Baci al Zuhair was reached. This case is similar to the suit I filed against the remaining heirs of Ali Pasha Al-Zuhair. After discussing the matter with him he mentioned to me that he finds it necessary to continue with the suit filed against the heirs of Ali Pasha al Zuhair in spite of the decision existence of of the Court of Appeal which contains/time-barred in asking for the return of purchase money, because according to his opinion there are some acknowledgments in the case which was filed by Hafia bint Ali Pasha al Zuhair and probably both Courts of First Instance and Appeal will consider these acknowledgments as a cause for cutting the time-barred, and he, for this reason sees that it is better to continue this case also and follow it to the end and pay the necessary expenses. I have carefully examined the file of the previous case filed by Rafia bint Ali Pasha al Zuhair and have found no clear acknowledgments which would cut the time-barred end even if there exist any such acknowledgments, they will concern Rafia only and will not include the regaining heirs. I therefore leave the question of continuing this case entirely for Your Fxoellency to decide and reruest you to give me your instructions in this respect as soon as possible because the opponent has asked for khE appointing the date for seeing the case and on that date will be necessary to pay another Court due ecual to I.D.69-000 in o.der to continue the case and if the second Court due is not paid the Court will decide to drop this case temporary.

Lawyer, Basrah, through our son Mohammad. The letter informs us about the case of the FALLAHE.SN of our property at Fao and how 1 ^ - r l * ' I* ' they ore acting fraudulently and continually and how they are encouraged by those who are known to you. The lawyer has execu te i by way of security the crops and the palm leaves so that they may not be lost as it happened last year. The execution by way of the law has been obtained through the assistance of the Chief ( Judge) of t&gt;,e Court, Mr. Cood, bot the Iraqi authoti. ties do not wish to execute any thing or reserve any right. They, therefore are producing excuses and inspiring the Fallaheen to refuse to pay the rights of the land-lord. The Qa/em-m.aqam was approached being the district governor and osKed to interfere in the m tter/ but his reply was that he had orders from Iraq Government not to interfere i-% the case bet ween the fallaheen and the shaikhs, and he added that their case was with the Court of the Land Sttloment. This shows that the matter is purposely done and directed against us, for no other reason except that we are ^'■'y°l to our friendship and our duties toward H.R.M’s Govt., those duties which we cannot neglect. I wish to assure Your Lxcellency,that we will never change our tTipniship and our loyalty to our iovernment(i.e. British iovt.) for any thing how valuable it may be. The strange thing is that they are now asking us to submit to them a legal statement of the inheri tance of the Late $haikh Jabir the 1st. claiming that the Land Settlement Committe have decided that the property of Fao to be for the heirs of the above mentioned ( Jabir) I therfore wish to inform you that it is not so easy to get a Legal Statement of the Inheritance at present, but in fact it is impossible for many reasons. .Firstly,ifcs the time barred, and in addition to that, there i- no time to be wasted now that the crops are at hand, and this will help these who are acting fraudulently to act more and more. Secondly, It is •vellknovn that this property is the legal property belonging to us and to ourfathers and forefathers and no one had ever had any dispute •vith a us concerning this property, and the Fallaheen have their rights according to the custo/ns followed hy us and by all other land- v lords. But' thesf matters are real(y meant to disturb us and are di rected against us just to put us in trouble and to force us to meet unnecessary expenses, this besides what we will have to suffer morally. I, therefore request Your Excellency to consider these matters carefully and put them up to the Hon’ble the Political Resident, to taxe whatever steps he is in opinion that they may orotect our rights and h^p property from being iestroyed as a result of the continuous’ act- of fraudulenoe taken by ^e fallaheeh and by those who are instigating them, who are doing that purposely and whose intention is to create the troubles. I hope and trust that our rights will be reserved and protec ted through the en'ergity and care^of Your Excellency and tie Hon # ble the Political Resident.

After Compliments, As a result of my commun tcations and ray request, on behalf of His Highness your father and his partners, the Basra Court of 1 st Instance has decided to enforce the execution by Ahe way of security, the crops and Ea’af of the date garden situated at Fao, which you haye asked me to execute by way of security, as oer the N statement submitted byjyou. Ihe deci^sion has been issued for af orementioned carrying out the/execution by way of security and has been sent ^ * to the official in charge of execution, Basrah, for execution. As Your Excellency is well aware, that the 10 th Committee of Land settlement, Basrah, have seen the case of the property at Eao, and the said Committee had decided that the district Ko ,6 at Fao was the property 8 ^ 0 i&lt;h Jabir as-Subah, the 1 st, and we, when we asked for ’ execution by way of Security ’ to be enforced -on the«products of the said land, did not de.end on the decisions of ownership decided by the aforementioned Land Settle ment, but we depended on the agreements of the fallaheen and the documents of liability which vere given to me by you and which are written in the name of your father, His Highness Shaikh Sir .Ahmed al-Jabir as-Subah only, and I hadff to do this because if I were to depend on the decisions of the Land Settlement, I would have to produce a Legal Statement of the inheritence of Shaikh .Jabir, the 1st and was asked by the Court of 1 st Instance to produce such statement, and as xx have not had it, I had to depend on the above- mentioned agreements and the documents of liability. As a result of this, the Court of 1 st Instance have decided, by the majority of the members, to enforce the ’ Execution by way of Security ’ on the crops and Sa’af of the aforementioned date ^arden. The agreements and the documents of liability had been issued before the issue of the decision of the Land Settlem^n* the^Land Settlement were issued as a result of your producing these agreements. The decisions of the Land Settlement are there-fore, the docuni^nts on i, vhioh tho cfiso ^enonds as as th 0 4 legal ownership of the property is concerned and which ’oes not agree with the agreements and the documents of liability which are witten in the name of your father, His Highness Shaikh Ahmed al-Jabir as-Subah. It has therefore become n cessary to depend on the decisions of the Land Settlement a'nd to produce Legal Mvision for the purpose of filing a suit and to have the ’ Executio by way of Lav f bein^ sarictinned and thus to succeed in the case. “ ,e I, therefore, request you to hasten to have the Legal Division concerning the Legal St * 5 + t 0 f the inheritence of Shaikh Jabir the 1 st, being made ready and to inform me of the result.

It was also noticed that the decision of the Land Settlement mentions the property in the name of Jabir as-Subah, while one of the heirs, as he claims to be, is asking for the execution by way of the Law,and he was asked to produce a Legal Document of Inheritance, which he failed to do. Ihe quantity asked to be executed by way of the Law is, on one hand not pointed out and on .the other hand, the boundaries of the piece of land in question are not kno vn.

This year, since, owing to shi Clients fron Persia, where dates are cheaper than in 1 Iraq., dates are cheaper in Kuwait than they are at Pao, the Shaikh of Kuwait has been graciously pleased to inform the Concessionaires that all his dates from his Fao gardens will he sold to them. As the ’Iraqi Government has raised the order of the courts forbidding the disposal of dates by the Shaikh’s tenants, these, despite the Sheikh’s having placed sentries at the mouths of the creeks running thru his gardens, are rex&gt;orted to be smuggling dates from the common heaps, that is to say the heajis of dates as yet undivided between owner and tenant, to the Persian shore for shipment abroad, altho the actual price on the Persian shore is less than the official one on the other. It pays them better to receive a low price on the dates owned conjointly by landlord and tenant than to receive a high price only on their own share. How much has crossed the river I do^ not know, but the Customs Mamur at Abu al-Khasib thought that 500 mann would be a not unreasonable guess. * The only dates I myself saw crossing the river were seven nann in an chinkuwa (small-boat with hull made of galvanised iron, usually stolen from the military, tho this is not essential to' the definition) near the Shaikh’s land.0 * No. 1662 Dear Chancery U I c.* (24/1/1) A subject which appears to come up for consideration with unfailing regularity each year at this Consulate-General is the pro perty and estates at pao of the Ruler of Kuwait. During the date season of 1943 the local fellahin refused to give up to the Ruler 1 s agents His Highness’ share of the dates in the gardens. The result was a Court case, which the Ruler won on appeal. The period during which the case could have been carried to the Court of Cassation, following on the result of the appeal, has, we are informed, expired, so that the Ruler has now been confirmed in his rights of ownership of the date gardens. 2. Meanwhile, the dates of the 1943 crop have disappeared, and we are informed that the Ruler intends to seek compensation at law for their loss; that will be another story. ^3* Successive Political Agents at Kuwait, have sought our assistance in this troublesome matter of the Ruler’s date gardens at Pao, and we have voluminous files on the subject. V/e have correspond ed regularly with the Mutasarrifiyah about these dates. In a letter, No. 5 dated January 1st, 1944(4/1/13^3) from the Mutasarrifiyah to His Majesty’s Consulate-General, however, we were informed that the Ministry of the Interior had objected to the intervention of the Mutasarrifiyah in the matter, stating that the Court was the proper authority to deal with the subject, in accordance with Article 33 of the Land Settlement Law, No.29 of 193^. Article 33 , as translated from the Mutasarrif iyah’s letter, states' that:- 'No one will be permitted to intervene in any cases touching rights of Land Settlement, or the Court of pirst Instance or the Court of Appeal as defined by this Law’.'. 4. This ruling did not by any means, however, put an end to our general correspondence on the subject. There has for some time been a lull, but during the last few days Shaikh Mohammad, son of the Ruler of Kuwait, has called at this office to say that he is concerned about the safeguarding of the 1944 date-crop in the Gardens at P^o, and that his agent, ’Abdul ’Aziz al-Mani’, acting Mayor of Basra, is going on July 27th to Bagdad, where he will seek an interview with Mr. Edmonds, Advisor to the Ministry of the Interior. At this interview ’Abdul ’Aziz al-Hani’ hox)es to persuade Mr. Edmonds to procure the rescission of the instruction prohibiting the Mutasarrifiyah of Basra Liwa from actively interesting itself in these date-gardens at Pao. * 5. ’Abdul ’Aziz al-Mani’ will call at the Embassy, where, v/e venture to hope, a brief introduction, either by telephone or in writing, may be arranged to enable him to meet Mr. Edmonds.

After Complindents, I have the honour to inform Your Highness that the I&gt;aqi Ministry of Finance and Interior have decided to give the Rive- Bantes of our property at Fao to the farmers and the workmen, and this is according to the request of Sulaiman al-Shawaf, their lawyer. I, immediately after having heard this decision, have submittei a vritten protest to H.K.the Mutosarrif and I met him personally ani eKptainel to him that the river banks are ^iven to the landlord, and that is according to the law of the land whatever nationality the landlord may be holding. His reoly was ' Excuse me,. I can do nothing against the decision of the Ministries of Finance and Interior, whehothey have both decided to give the river ban&gt;? to the farmers, but you can submit a protest to the Ministry of Finance, as quick as you can, i.e. befor the farmers obtain a free hand. ” He then' told me privately that it may propably be the Government policy against you, when the Govt, decided to hand over the river banks to the farmers. He uttered this quite frankly and asxed me to communi- with Baghdad as soon as pssible, so that we may not miss the chance. • T ^ of the river banks Your Hig ness is veil aware that the free hand/granted to the farmers, and their having the right of farming°it, will mean that our property at Fao will disappear and we will not be able to draw any benefit in a free manner. This will also affect all other property belonging to us. I» therfore request you to expalin the situation to the authorities concerned, so that they may ask the authorities concerend in Iraq to interfer in the matter and to cancel this order, i.e. handing over the river banks to the farmers, and that they should follow the justice. They should be req uested also to asK the Iraqi Govt, to co-operate in the question of _ rotecting our rig^t* oni to collect our Lagd Rights, which the farmers owe us this vear and Last year, too. Your Highness is well aware that we had filed many suits against them, and we hope that the truth will come in iue course and in the proper way. The most important thing now,is the river banks which are being taken from us without justice. It is, therfore very important to asx the authorities concerned in Iraq to protect our rights, because the Iraqi G-ovt. ,b.y taking such steps, i.e. depriving us from our rights, is acting against us and depriving us of our legal rights, paying no attention to the law.

As you will see from the enclosed copy of our Note No.251 to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have returned the summons of Jabir bin Abdullah and have asked that, if necessary, a new summons should be served on the lawyer Iskander Mansur at Basra. 2* We understand that, as neither party appeared before the Court on December 17th last, the case was postponed and that the next hearing is fixed for May 18th. It seems however that the whole case may be a mistake since the Land Settlement Committee is reported to have decided that plots Noil6 and 17 of Muqata f ah No. 6 (the subject of the summons) are the property of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance, not of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The appellant therefore appears to have lodged his appeal against the wrong person, and if this is so no doubt it will simply be dismissed. 3« We think however that it would be as well to confirm this poipt, if you can do so.

No, 0/513. Dated, 2nd June, 1945. .Reference my telegram no. 454 dated the 14th May, 1945. Shailch # s date gardens at Fao. 2. The problem is far from new. Attention was first directed to it by Hiclcinbotham in his letter No. 0/829 of the 30th August, 1942, and it remained the subject of correspondence until finally the second expedient suggested by him in paragraph 6 of his letter No. c/321 dated the 16th May, 1943. vas tried, but unsuccessfully. The fact appears to be that, whether as a result of illiberal behaviour on the part of the shaikh or of instigation by the Iraqis, none of the Shaikh 1 ® tenants are well disposed towards him. Until recently, however, although the 'reclaimed' 1 land to the East and the desert land to the West of the gardens, both of which Kis Highness considered belonged to him, have been registered as the property of the Iraq Government no steps had been taken to bring the former under cultivation, and His Highness enjoyment of his Fao gardens had accordingly not been immediately threatened. 5. On my recent visit to Fao I investigated the site and coneluded that the description of the land as 'reclaimed' is incorrect in so far as no human activity has been responsible for its emergence from the river. The Shatt al k a ? built up, between the gardens and the river channel, substantial flats of silt varying in width from three to four hundred yards in the neighbourhood of the Fao customs to what appeared to be well over half a mile at t^ishla itself. This is the result of the same natural process which has caused the land limit of Iraq to advance southwards from Basra in the last few centuries and, I believe, from Ur of the Chaldees within a measurable period of history, and it was, perhaps, too much to expect that the Iraqis should present all future accretions to their country to the Shaikh of Kuwait by agreeing that his proprietary rights extended to the sea shore. It is indisputable that most of this land was not in existence when our guarantee of 1914 was given to Shaikh Mubarak. ^ ^ Besides the consequences mentioned in paragraph 3 of Hickinbotham's letter cited above, the cultivation of the 'reclaimed' land will result in a considerable depreciation in the value of His Highness* property, as date gardens are vaiued in direct proportion to their distance from the river. Further the 'lhaikMs tenants will remove the irrigation pipes ^ rorn l&amp;od to the land granted to them together vvith the young date trees. All these His Highness claims as his property but he will not be able to obtain any redress ii view of the present attitude of the local authorities referred to in paragraph 4 of my telegram under reference. 5* I find it impossible to escape the conclusion that the Iraq Government, having been unable to dispossess His Highness of his Fao gardens by pseudo-legal means as in the case of the Bashiya gardens, are detenoined to deny him the enjoyment of than by other and no less effective expedients. / The first2 f The first of these has heen daalt with above; the second appears to he deliberate connivance at the misappropriation by the Shaikh's tenants of his share of the date harvest and the denial to him of the assistance of the executive authorities in enforcing his rights, Erom the voluminous correspondence which took place last year on the subject it emerges that the Ministry of the Interior “objected to the interference of the Mut^sarrifiyeh in the matter regarding the (Land Settlement) Court as the competent authority to deal with it The question of*how the Shaikh's share of the harvest is to be secured to him in future is a complicated and tedious one and will be dealt with separately. Incidentally, it is regretted that the figures given in paragraph three of my letter No. C/448 of the 17th May, 1945. were incorrect. The value of the 1943 and 1944 crops lost to the Shaikh are estimated at Iraq. Dinars 13,000 and Iraq. Dinars 21,000 to Iraq. Dinars 24,000 respectively. I can take no responsibility for the accuracy of these figures but they may serve as a rough guide to the magnitude of the sums involved. 6. The Iraq. Government's third expedient is the registration of the property in the name of the heirs of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah. • I have no doubt that the complicated inheritance document which His Highness has produced will be successfully contested in the Iraqti Courts and it will be decided that he has no right to speak for the heirs of Jabir bin Abdullah - that, in fact, he is not the owner of the property and camct claim the protection of the law. I have no idea at present of the value of the Fao property but it is very many times greater than that of the Bashiya gardens, and I feel that His Majesty's Government should realise where their present policy is leading them. 7 * impression is that His Highness and his son Mohammad are not entirely free of blame for the present position. iShereas Shaikh Mubarak used to treat his tenants in Iraq, with the greatest generosity and used to obtain as a consequence 130,000 mans of dates annually from Fao, they are reputed to concentrate only on extorting the utmost farthing of their dues from the cultivators and to give no thought to the welfare of the latter and the improvement of the estates. The existence of our guarantee of 1914 may possibly also lead them to xeex that when they are ejected froa the Fao gardens ample compensation will be paid by us, so tnat, for the present, all they need do is to concentrate on extracting the maximum dividends. Before confirming or reviewing this opinion and submitting recommendations I should like to pay another visit to Iraq, to consult Major Dowson, who, I believe, is an expert with many years* local experience. I hope to do this early in June. ~ y _ I am not repeating this express letter to the imcassanor, Baghdad, partly because it deals with policy partly because it refers to two letters which have not been sen wo him.

Your son Shaikh Mohammed told me that he had sent the copy of my letter which I had mentioned to him regarding fixing the fee and have explained to him that it is not enough for the case I have appointed, so Shaikh Mohammed said that he iiad forwarded the letter to Your Highness and is waiting lour Highness 1 order on this subject. For ease of reference I enclose a copy of the said letter addressed to Shaixh Mohammed dated the 12th May, 1945.^'^ In view that the Court of Appeal of the Second Land Settlement in Baghdad, as it is explained to Your Highness in their letter enclosed, asked me, when I was in Baghdad, the notification of the summons regarding the private cases of the late Shaikh Jabir As-Subah.

After my return I consulted with your son Shaikh Mohammed and/and he explained to me that still he did not receive any information from Your Highness, so if the matter had been put up before Your Highness and still you did not pay any attention to it, I therefore have the honour to inform Your Highness in this letter regarding the matter and I hope that you will favour me with a reply as I/in an awkward position, because the Courts are asicing me to inform them about the summons of the inheriof the late Shaikh Jabir As-Subah and it is not possible that I refuse or to accept it because I have not yet received any reply from Your Highness, Usual Ending,n c/i K I * a S S ' 1 ' at ^ on ^ ^- e ' t ' ter No. 1062 dated the 28th May Bastdad^tr^fh A ? peal Court of the Second Land Settlement, Baghdad, to the lawyer As^ander Mansur, Basrah.

Reference to your letter No.1957/3022/44 dated the 5th October, 1944. The British Embassy at Baghdad had informed the foreign Ministry that it was not possible to tlie notification of the summon before the appointed date for t-he hearing of the case. The Embassy had known that c-o favour tne matter have taKen the necessary steps to appoint the advocate Askander Mansur in Basrah for acting on behalf of the inheritSUe of Jabir bin Abdullah. Therefore the Embassy requests if it is not necessary in the meantime to issue a new summon, to inform the lawyer Asunder Mansur. Enclosed herewith the summon.po) /' :runslation of letter dated the ISth May. 1945 ivom the lawyer Askander Mansur, Basrah, to Shaikh Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Jabir As-sibah, Basrah. ite After Compliments, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that after the investigations in the cases which are filed in the Court of Appeal of the Land Settlement in Baghdad in respect of the Fao case which is disputed between my clients His Highness Shaixh Ahmed Al-Jabir As-Subah (your father) and his companions the inheritors of late Aiaixh Jabir As-3ubah and between the farmers in the said area and also the other appealers some of them are from the inheritors of the late Shaikh Jabir As-Subah. We became to know that the said Court of Appeal had appointed the date 16th May, 1945 to deal with the abovementioned cases which are approximately more than 1900 suits filed in the said Court in Baghdad. As these cases are numerous and it is not aware to Your Excellency Wun its enormous number and no one can imagine to deal with these cases and to defend them without exertion or strain especially it needs my presence in Baghdad because the said Court is in Baghdad and not in Basrah, therefore it requires several trips to Baghdad which effects in my practice and force me to leave it as it is xnown to Your Excellency, because there are some suits in Basrah concerning my abovementioned clients His Highness and his companions. These are the previous suits which have been filed in the last season for the attachmentsof the dates of the Eao area against the farmers. The attachments which amounts nearly sixty in numbers and they are still under the pleading, as they were delayed up to now for the reason of your being late to complete the legal shares which belongs to the inheritors of the late Shaikh Jabir As-Subah and which the Court of First Instance in Basrah had asxed us its presentation. Moreover Your Excellencymust ask us the attachments of the dates nf oi tiao area against the far!,lers according to the attachments of the last ± season. There is no doubt that Tour Excellency had witnessed our exertions and strain which to do our best to complete a ground for the said attachments which are nearly sixty in numbers. According to the decision of the Court irst Insta ice in Basrah it is necessary to file a separate suit on every farmer, so according to this the total of the suits which we should file will become nearly to one thousand and similar number of the attachments. And in view of what we have mentioned above Your Excellency will consider this difficult job which it is not comparisable to its yearly fee which had been fixed between us last year, because the said fee was not fixed for these cases as Your Excellency know it. So it is not possible that I can deal With these cases for the said trifling fee, because I will be compelled to leave all other work for several months and to be engaged to complete your abovementioned cases. Referenc to that I say that the said yearly fee is not acceptable and I beg Your Excellency to fix a suitable fee for the said suits which is I.0.4000/- excluding the expenses and travelling fares -etc. which will be debited to the abovementioned clients and' they have to pay half of the said fee in advance and the rest after finishing the cases. As you xnow that the advocate of the opponent parties i.e. t farmers) had already received the full fee in advance amounting to I.D.10,000/- eluding the expenses which are not less than this amount, so to compare my fee which I have mentioned above with the lawyer’s fee of the opponent parties is very trifle. Therefore I beg Your Excellency the approval for the fee which I have mentioned above, and there is no doubt Your Excellency know all these difficult jobs that no one can do them for a trifle fee. Therefore please inform me whether you have agreed or not, if not, X am very sorry that I will be unable to deal with the cases.

The refusal is made on the grounds that, since the appeal of the tenants against the registration of the estate in the name of His Highness is pending, the question of the ownership of the gardens and produce is sub Judice. I submit that, in accordance with tta established legal procedure elsewhere, the status quo should be maintained during the currency of the case ana the ?haikh continue to receive his share of tne produce as he has done for the last thirty years and more. As an example, a translation of a complaint, alleging theft and wilful damage against certain of the tenants, filed in the L&lt;£ Court of the ^aim Map am of Afoul Khasifr on the 27th May, 1945, is appended. No written answer was given to the Shaikh but he was vei^bally informed that the officials concerned had received orders from Baghdad prohibiting them from interfering between the rhaikh and his tenants. 2. It is improbable that the appeals will be disposed of by the time the present crop is harvested and. if the action or, rather, inaction of the local adi^inistrative authorities is allowed to ross without a protest, it is certain that His Highness will lose his share of the entire &amp;?.te crop as he has done for the last two years.

The responsibility of your office for the maintenance of the status quo ante in the districts where settlement has been announced does not go beyond the definition of the state of affairs regarding the actual posession of the lands at the time when the declaration of settlement was made. It is not for the Department to interfere in the matter of the landlords claim against the cultivators or Ta T aba for the proprietory share (of the crop) or to force the latter to surrender this share on the grounds of the mere claim of the landlord that it was customarily surrendered up to the date of the announcement of the settlement since this is a matter 'for the decision of the courts. The announcement of the settlement in the district does not affect the right of the landlord to refer this matter to the courts. If this reference leads to the verification in the court of the ownership of the land it is for the - court to decree the postponement of the decision until such time as the decision of the settlement in the matter has been issued. 3. In the case in point it is open to the Shaikh of Kuwait to institute legal proceedings against the cultivators for the recovery of the proprietory share of the crop, and he may demand the precautionary attachment of the crops claimed. If the court, hearing this case* considers it necessary to await the result of the appeal against the- settlement on the question of ownership of the land it will make such orders as it considers suitable. 4. accordingly kindly exercise care in the disposal of the case in the light of what has gone before.© (&amp;£ ITo.

Acting on the advice of his lawyer, the Shaikh of Kuwait has compiled a new Inheritance Document leaving out the names and the shares of Ali Mohammed A1 Subah and Lulwa al Ghuneim. The reason for this step is that, as the Iraqi Courts have already passed a decree against both Ali Mohammed Al Subah and Lulwa al Ghuneim when they claimed rights In the Fao property, the inclusion of their names in the Inheritance Document would enable them to appeal against the previous decree, and obtain a new judgement in their favour. 3 # Copies of the fresh Inheritance Document and of the Power of Attorney in favour of the Shaikh are enclosed for substitution for the first two enclosures of my memorandum under reference.

Some time ago, Mr. Ditchburn says, the latter aporoached the Kutasarrif regarding the Land Settlement Officer's decision, declaring plots 14 and 15 as miri sirf in the name of the Ministry of Finance, but the Mutasarrif informed him that such • appeals must be lodged with the Special Land Court, 3. In Mr. Ditchburn's opinion, the fact that no such appeal has been made by the Sheikh's legal representatives indicates that they realize the weakness of their case, 4, In general Mr. Ditchburn says that the me ta y age system in Iraq is attended by many evils. Any trouble that the Sheikh may be experiencing with his fellahin is.unfortunately of only too common occurrence. 5.

I Have tried f.r a lon 0 time and have done my best to avoid bothering you with any of the outstanding cases which are in the Court of Settle ment and in other Courts as well. I-tried to settle these cases, personally, by using every possible uethod. I communicated icxfck repeatedly with the Courts and asked that our cases should be bosh, as they were very important, but they continued to hinder the progress of our cases by putting off and deferring the court sittings. This negligence I saw in all courts and by all judges in general.' They have been postponing our cases from month to month and from-a long periocl?tTr'?r long : Qri-^d- on various pretexts, without having any grounds for these postponments. Your Highness is well aware that their sole purpose is to win time and give tne farmers a chance to consume the dates of the ka® estate this season, as they did in the pr^vi^us years. As for Salman Faidhi, the lawyer, he does not care how long the case hangs fire, as he gets his annual fees, and the delay of the cases by the courts for a longer period is in his favour, because he will continue to receive his annual fees from us. I have asked him several times to ask the court to fix the date for appeal and to try our cases. He goes to the Judge and asks him to^tf^our cases, but the Judge ma. es many excusesand postpones the cases from month to month . More- ‘ • i over,, the Judge appointed to try our cases in the Court of Appeal of the Land Settlement is the Acting Chief Judge of Basra Liwa and in the same time he performs other duties. For Example he performs the following duties 1 . He tries the cases of Appeal of the Land Settlement, for us &amp; others. 2. He is a member of the jlCourt of Appeal of 3. He is member of the Highj^Conrt 9^ Loyalty. 4 . He * * -the Judge of the Court of Penal ^7 of Rationing. # 5 . He goes on tours to Amara and Haserdyia now and then and stays there for the purpose of cases of HighACourt af Peral ty„ Thus the Judge appointed to see our cases is being kept busy with several duties and our cases will remain pending in Courts for ever. The Court should h-^ve fixed certain dates to try our cases, which are numerous, and pass the final judgement according to tku^ Law and Justice, whether in our favour or against us and settle this problem. Sulaiman Faidhi, the lawyer and myself beleive th t it is the Government of Iraq who are delaying vx postponing our cases purposely by suggesting to the Courts to delay the cases for the purpose of causing loss and damage to us &amp; to enable the farmers(Taaba) to consume our dates and to make us appear in the eyes of the farmers as helples^ and failures, a»d ®n )Trado Unions and tha Anti-Zionist League have apnaalod for national solidarity in the defence of tho Palestine cause, The taxt of the Iraqi Governments protest against the Commission 1 s recommendations is published in all papers. message published in all papers refers to the Council i”^ ^ usrj ^ a ^^ising the Palestine question at tho Security at ^ T.

The lawver states that our cases are numerous and it is impossible to submit their numbers and copy them from the Court, due to their great number, which is more than 3,000 cases, lying in Basra Court of Appeal of Land Sett lement, filed by the Ta'aba ( farmers ) of Kao. They are fill in one court and were submitted to one judge, as I have already informed Your Highness in my previous letter. The cases being so many are independent, welKnown and need no explanation or definition. The lawyer tells me that if we ask to copy them from the Courts we would require a special clerk to copy three thousand or more appl,cations according to number of cases,and each 3c every application will cost us money, the total of which will be a great amount. toreover it will taxe a long time to complete the wotk.

This year there is no Judge at Abul Khasib as the post is an unpopular one and officials nominated for it invariably find good reasons for not taking up the appointment. When the appeals are finally decided the shaikh should sus his tenants for his share of the produce for X943 9 i * 1944, 1945;and 1946. This, of course, would be a waste of tlme^ except possibly In regard to the produce attached last year and rsleaaed against security. 4. There is another bone of contention at Jfeo. The Land Settlement, while registering the actual date gardens as subah property, registered the uncultivated but cultivable mud flats between the gardens and the river as the property of the xv&amp;ql Ministry of the Interior. Suleiman Shawwaf has succeeded in having this allotted to the Shaikh's tenants for cultivation and it has actually been divided up among them, as soon as they have paid the lawyer and the Government their dues the tenants will be free to cultivate this area and, in doing so, will cause considerable harm to the Shaikh's properties. Host, if not all, of this land has been deposited by the action of thi river since 1914 and is therefore not directly covered by our guarantee to Shaikh Mubarak. 5. A possible further complication is that the division of the property among the heirs of Shaikh Jablr bin Abdullah as S ubah and the Power of Attorney purporting to empower Shaikh Ahmed al Jabir to act on their behalf may be successfully challenged. This, however, has not yet occurred. 6 . There is another date - garden about which there has been litigation, and in regard to which ills Majesty's Government's obligations to the Shaikh havs not yst been fulfilled. It is the Bashiya garden forming part of the Faddaghlya estate, and, on the a 4th May, 1944, the Shaikh's appeal was rejected and 130 out of the £16 shares into which the garden Is divided passed out of the Shaikh's possession.

The latter has made a verbal complaint in the strongest terms and has asked for assistance from His Majesty’s Government. 2. The oases to which he refers are over 3,000 appeals by the tenants of the Fao estates of His Highness the Shaikh against the decision of the Land settlement Court promulgated in the Iraq Gazette No.2166 of the 21st February, 1944 and registering the estate in the name of the heirs of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah As Subah. 3 . These appeals were filed in early 1944 in the Land Settlement Appeal Court in Baghdad, but this court was closed down in the summer of 1945 and provincial Land settlement Appeal Courts were set up in its place. The appeals were accordingly transferred to the Court at Basra and were lirst called in January and February, 1946. Since when there has been postpone ment after postponement and no proceedings have been taken, 4. As will be seen from the letter forwarded under cover of my Secret Printed Letter No.C/762 dated the 13th August, 1945 to India Office, Governrent of India and Ambassador, Baghdad, and my letter No.C/648 dated the 17th July, 1946 to you it is not possible for the Shaikh to recover his rent in kind while these appeals are pending, and It is probably not an exaggera tion to say that he has lost as the result about £ 50,000/-, which there is very little chance of his ever recovering by litigation. 5 . There is no doubt that Mahmud I’zzat the Deputy president of the Courts in Basra, before whom the appeals are pending, is overworked; but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the delay may be due to Intrigues on the part of Suleiman Shawwaf, the' appellants’ lawyer, in Baghdad (where he has con siderable Influence). Further delay is manifestly to the advan tage of his clients and to the disadvantage of the Shaikh. 6. I have the honour to submit that the virtual miscarriage of justice disclosed by His Highness’ complaint should be made the subject of a protest to the Government of Iraq.

It is understood that the Shaikh’s son Mohammed and his la^vyer In Basra are much handicapped in this liti gation by the present Iraqi law goTOming the registration of instruments execrated outside Iraq. 2. Such instruments are accepted by Iraqi courts if they are countersigned by the Iraqi Consul in the State in which they were executed . Until 1941 they were also accepted if countersigned in the absence of an Iraqi Consul by the Minister of Justice of the foreign State, but in 1941 the relevant law was amended to read M Minister of Justice of Iraq H . The Iraqi courts will therefore not now accept documents countersigned by the Political Agent, Kuwait and they must all be sent to the Ministry of Justice in Baghdad for countersignature. 3. The Sheikh’s lawyer is certain that somewhere in the law of Iraq His Majesty’s representatives empowered to represent Iraqi interests in countries where Iraq is not represented but he has been unable to find any such enactment. If he cound find and quote the relevant law, it would be possible for him to demand that instruments executed in Kuwait and countersigned by the Political Agent in the absence of an Iraqi Consul, should be accepted by the Courts, and this would be of considerable assistance to him. 4. No information on the subject is available in this office, but it seems probable that the Embassy at Baghdad might be able to assitet us.OONJ'IttSHT.Ul . Mfj Politioal Agent, Kuwait^ Oamp Quetta.

We might at the same time suggest that the Iraq Government indicate tne rent they are prepared to offer. 5.

GENERAL . In June 1943 the lawyer Nasrat al pars! suggested that All Mumtaz should succeed him on his appointment as Ambassador to Angara and that a Power of Attorney on behalf of all the heirs of shaikh Jabir al Abdullah should be drawn up in his favour. The shaikh complied with his suggestion but was then asked to pro* duce an iabirltanoe document showing the divis- ion 0 f the estates between the heirs. This could not be done and a certificate to that effect signed by the Kuwait Qadhi was submitted to the courts. 2. In March, 1944 the Basra Port Directorate approached Els Highness through Shaikh Mohammed, his son, with the request that he lease to them an area adjoining the Port Installations at pao. They were told in reply that the matter should be taken up by the Iraqi Government through diplomatic channels, whereupon the proposal was temporarily dropped but has since been revived, (see paragraph 5.) The question had previously beexi raised in 1935 to 1936 vide correspondence ending with the Embassy's letter No. 38/1/36 dated the 7th August, 1936. 3. The attachment of the produce of the Jfeo gardens was abrogated in October, 1944 owing to lack of an inheritance document setting out the heirs of Shaikh Jabir As subah (see paragra* ph 7 under 'flao'.) in April, 1945 His Highness after some pressure produced an inheritance document purporting to show the number of shares in the date gardens held by each of the heirs °f Shaikh Jabir bin Abdullah. 4. In June, 1945 His Highness severed his con nection with the lawyer Iskander Mansur and employed Messrs Sulaiman paidhi and Jamil Sadiq instead at a salary of £ 500 p#a. on a two years contract. On the advice of his new law yers he amended the inheritance document pro duced earlier in the year. Xe Xxky? tfciaf ttM 5. In July, 1946 the Basra port Trust again approached the Shaikh with a proposal to lease or buy an area of his property adjoining the Port installations at ?ao (see paragraph 2 above II. PAQ . 6 .

The Mutassarif, upon whom pressure was brought by the Consulate- GtenerauL, proposed that the harvest should be es timated by five appraisers, two appointed by His Highness, two by the tenants, and one, hypothetic ally neutral, by the Iraq. Government. Much of the crop Wc.s, howevor, made aray with bofore the appraisal could be carried out and the committee estimated the total crop at 12,725 mans while the Shaikh's soniiohamed considered that 34,377 was the correct total.

This was carried by the 'Basra Court in respect of that portion of the property (about half) which was hell under tenancy agreements stipulating that disputes should be heard by that Court. The Abul Khaaib Court, ^hiich ms concerned with the remain ing half of the property, refused to make any attachment order. Such of the crop as was attach ed was released to the tenants on their providing a surety. It rill be for the Shaikh to sue the surety for the value of the crop attached when anc if the Appeal Court finally rejects the appeals of the tenants against the Land Sou element decision. 11.

Political Agent, Kuwait. &amp;.B. *(iii) (Translation of a letter dated the 6th October, 1946 from Shaikh Mohammed al Ahmed al Jabir As-Subah, Basrah to His Hi jhness the'Huler of Kuwait) . i At the opening of the season I had asked the Mutasaffif to assist and help us to protect our rights to the present year’s crops at Fao, but the Mutassarrif asked me to refer the matter to the Court of Justice for the purpose of obtaining the necessary orders from the court in this respect but he himself refused to render us any assist ance in obtaining our rights to the dates of our property at''Kao. Thus we were forced to communicate with the courts ? in order to protect our rights, and the lawyers_Sulaiman Faidhi and his partner arranged the cases and their executions by way of security amd we seized by legal authority all of our share of the dates at Fao through the Courts at Basrah and Ah$ulkheseeb. We appointed a 3rd person to X^rotect the dates and we engaged guards and hired motor launches to patrol the river and we had arranged every thing to preserve our rights of the Fao crops this year. But Sulairaan Shawaf, the Ta’aba’s lawyer made certain arrange ments with the Judge of Basrah, named Andres Ashu, and submitted to him notices of protest against our seizures and asked the judge to remove the seizures. The aforementioned judge, Andres Asfiu passed a judgment for the removal of all the seizures secured by us, in a way*which is against justice and law. from various points of view, as I was informed by Kaj Sulaiman Faidhi our lawyer wfio added that these violations of the law are as follows:- T (i) Shlaiman Shawaf, the lawyer does not hold a power of attorney from all the Ta’abas (farmers), but he submitted the notice of protest against the seizure on behalf of all of them, and his protests were accerjted. This is a clear violence of the law, as Sulaiman Faidhi'the lawyer says. (ii) The notices of protest should be sutoraitted to the Court by the defendants (those against whom the seizure according to law was enforced) their lawyer within a period df 8 days only from the date of seizure, jtbud but the aoovementipned judge has passed his decision for the removal of the seizure on the Fao dates after 50 days and this, according to Sulaiman Faidhi, is against the law 0 ' T e, even had old debts i.e, our rights of the crops for the past years to be recovered from the Ta * aba, but this year we did not seize except our share of the dates which are our rights of the crops for the current year. He left the Ta’abas shares with them and did not interfere with them at all, because we were afraid that we might fail with our seizure. T ~ T e submitted the legal securities and necessary guarantees to the court against the value of the dates seized by way of security against possible loss which the Ta’aba may sustain in case we v/ere found to be in the wrong in our seizure and in our case. ’Te have done all this as a precaution as the lawyer Sulaiman Faidhi wanted it to be. But the above mentioned judge in spite of afl these precautionary measures taken by us, passed a decree for the removal of the seizure c on all the Fao dates dashing all our requests, which were supported by official documents, against the wall. 17 e have thus failed in all our seizures which ‘were filed in the [ court of Basrah, and when the judge of Abulkhesib Court saw the dec ree of the judge of the Basrah Court of the First Instance for the removal of the seizure, he similarly issued a decision for the remov al of the seizure on the dates seized by the court of Abulkhesib and * so the seizure is removed from all Fao dates and were handed over to the Ta’aba and their lav/yer Sulaiman Shawaf. Your Highness is well aware that the decree passed by the above- mentioned judge (Andres AshLr) was coording to Sulaiman Faidhi the lawyer against thd law. I have discussed the matter with some other lawyer and asked them about the decision of this judge and they told me that the decision of the judge for the removal of the seizure isquits clearly against the law, but his agreement with Shlairaan Shawaf made him come in our way and pass such a decision for the removal of the seizure. Hai Sulaiman Faidhi submitted several protests against the remov al of the seizure, but the abovementioned judge paid no attention to legal protests, which are supoorted by documents, while he ? the said judge accepted protests of tfie lawyer Sulaiman Shawaf, which were against law and justice. The courts of Basrah, the Government and the administration are all against us and against our lawful claims. They incline towards the Ta*aba side and oulaiman Shawaf quite openly against us and there is no difference among the courts in^this respect. For example, the Settlement Court of Appeal which was detailed to see the cases, wheth er in our favour or against, was to be held on the 3rd October, 1946 to see some cases between ourselves and the Ta ! abas of Fac, and while they have been postponed andleft for future reference and they have been neglected. This shows quite clearly that such posty ponements are done purposely against us,~ and the delay of our case is m favour of the Ta^abas. 'The courts here are postponing then from time to tine without a reasonable excuse, but for the benefit of the defendants. I referred the matter to the Chief judge many times but he told me that these cases did not concern him.Telegram Q. From To Repeated No.562 Dated the 8th October, 1946. Political Agent, Kuwait.

The Embassy has the honour to state that His Highness the Sheikh of Kuwait will be prepared to consider the possibility of leasing this land to the Directorate of the Port of Basra on the receipt by him of a formal application from the Iraqi Government through the Embassy, giving details of the terms and condition of lease which the Directorate of the Port of Basra have in mind.

I 4 * N Copy, with copy of Residency letter No.670-S dated 4th September 1946, forwarded with compliments to - THE POLITICAL AGENT, KUWAIT T with reference to his letter No.Ca.14 dated Camp, Quetta, the 12th August 1946. NPGCONFIDENTIAL Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, No&gt;670-3 the 4th September 1946, Your Excellency, I have the honour to say that His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait has been informed by his son, Shaikh Mohammad as Subah in Basra that the Port Directorate wish to purchase or lease a plot of land measuring 4 donums jadid, the property of His Highness situated next to the Port Depot at Fao. 2 . This land forms part of the Shaikh's Fao estates and His Highness feels that his refusal to accede to the Port Director's request might lead to its forcible acquisition. He is prepared therefore to let the Port Authorities have the land on a long term lease. The land in question is still the subject of litigation with the Shaikh's tenants, vide enclosure to my printed letter No.C/655 dated the 15th August 1946. 3. The Political Agent and the Shaikh consider that in view of the present situation in regard to these properties it is desirable that any correspondence with the Iraqi Government should be conducted through the Embassy and not by a department of the Iraqi Government through his son. I agree with this view and request that, if Your Excellency has no objection, the Iraqi Government may be informed that His Highness is prepared to consider the request of the Port Director on receipt by him of a formal application through the Embassy, giving details of the terms and conditions on which it is desired to lease this land. I have the honour to be, Your Excellency's most obedient Servant, (SGD.) W.R.HAY. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. His Excellency Sir Hugh Stonehewer-Bird, KCMG., O.B.E., His Majesty's Ambassador, B A B H D A D. NPGBritish Itoibassy, Bagdad. 18th October, 1946 . Your letter No 0/657 of August 13th last has taken a long time to answer because the only remaining British legal expert in Bagdad has been on leave and our own researches into the laws of Iraq failed to reveal what we were looking for. We have, however, now been put on the right track and we enclose herewith a copy of Law No 36 of 1934 for the Confirmation of Signatures on Foreign Documents, and of Law No 32 of 1938 which amends the original law in the sense indicated in Major Tandy’s memorandum. 2 . It seems to us, however, that provided the Political Agent at Kowait is a Consular Officer and is charged with the protection of Iraqi interests it ought to be possible for him to legalise documents executed in Kowait. But the point is not entirely clear and, although an agreement has recently been reached between His Majesty’ Government and the Iraqi Government for the protection by British Consular Officers of Iraqi interests'in all countries of the world where there are no Iraqi representatives, we find that it will have to be settled by further correspondence. W e will let you know the answer in due course. 3* We are sending a copy of this letter with enclosure to Kowait. 128 2 / 10 A 6 Dear Residency, Yours ever, CHANCERY.

He realises that he is at the mercy of the latter and his heirs who are now the de jure owners, but is confident that Sayed Hamid during his lifetime will permit him to remain the de facto owner.

The garden has (His Highness^ admits) been bought for a price higher than the market price and higher the 18th May, 1945. The estimate of expenses in litigation given in paragraph 3 of my telegram No.535 dated the 10th was June, 1945/ however, only very approximate and I still consider that £ 10,000 would be a fair sum to be offered to the Shaikh in compensation. than the estimate given in my express letter Political Agent, Kuwait.LES - REPGrU - Telegram From To No.1438 Dated 20th and received 21st December, 1946.

We have not after all taken up officially the question of legalisation (by the political Agent at Kowait) of documents for use in Iraqi Courts, for, on further consideration it seemed to go without saying that if a British Consular Officer could legalise a foreign death certificate of an Iraqi he could equally well legalise a power of attorney. Wc hi.vu, henrever, discussed the matter -sith the Iraqi Director General of Justice who stated categorically that the political Agent*s attestation of a signature or document would be accepted by the Iraqi Courts. The British President of ths Court of Cassation says the same. The simplest thing therefore seems to be for it to be tried in practice. The next legal docun^nt made in Kowait for use in Iraq should be attested by the political Agent and presented to the courts in the normal wcy.

Tours ever, political Hesidency, CI&amp;NCIOTCONFIDENTIAL The Bolitical Agency, Kuwait. No.C/13. Dated the 5th January, 1947. From: The Political Agent, Kuwait . To: The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain . Subject:- Shaikh^ Date Gardens . Sir, ■ I have the honour to enclose 5 copies of a translation of a letter and its enclosure numbered R.6.3322 and dated the 23rd December, 1946 from His Highness the Shaikh, from which it will be seen that his lawyers wish to resign their appointment. 2. The suggestion that His Highness should appoint guards over his crop has not to my knowledgg t^een put forward since 1943 (vide Kuwait telegram No.651 dated the 2nd September, 1943). On that occasion the proposal, it will be recollected, was dropped because the Shaikh was unable to induce Iraqis to act as guards, and if armed Kuwait subjects were sent (such guards would have to be armed) the liklihood of clashes and loss of - life would have been considerable. Besides this, Fao is a prescribed area under an Iraqi Defence Regulation, and no foreigner may proceed there without a permit from the Mutasarrif These objections remain insuperable; and it is unlikely that Iraqis will be forthcoming for the work in 1947 if they could not be obtained in 1943. 3. It seems probable that the lawyers are prompted largely by chagrin at the unexpected reversal of the attachment orders which nullified all their efforts, but it is to be hoped that His Highness will manage to induce them to continue to represent him, although this could probably only be done by increasing their fees. It is not unlikely that pressure has been brought upon them by interested quarters in Iraq although there Is no proof of this; and if such is the case It is2 im it is/jprobable indeed that the Shaikh will be able to persuade other lawyers to represent him, 4. His Highness has stated categorically to me that he is certain that these troubles have only been brought upon him because he is represented by us vis -a- vls the Iraq Government, and that if he had direct dealings with them the matter would have been settled long ago. It is not to be inferred that he wants to have direct dealings with the Iraqis - he is too well aware of the dangers: but he does plead most emphatically that our Embassy take a more forceful line with the Iraq Government. 5. ' I submit that the history over the last few years of these estates constitutes ouch an irrefutable case of the victimisation of our protege the Shaikh that we would be justified in taking the Iraqi Government to task in the strongest terms. The salient facts are as follows (i) Up to and including 1942 the tenants of the Fao estate regularly rendered the Shaikh his proprietor’s share of the date crop, said to be worth about £ 12 , 000 /- annually. (ii) In 1943 the tenants, incited by a lawyer Sulaiman Shawwaf, refused to surrender the Shaikh’s share; but after much pressure a commission was appointed to assess the crop. By then most of the dates had in any case already been made away with; and the Abul Khasib judge, by refusing to recognise him as representing the heirs of Shaikh Jabir, the legal owners of the property, succeeded in thwarting the Shaikh’s efforts to secure even the share allowed him by the assessors. (iii) In 1944 the estate was registered by the Land Settlement Court as the property of the Shaikh, but nevertheless the tenants again succeeded in depriving the Shaikh of his rights. (iv) In 1945 the Shaikh managed to secure his share of such part of the crop as was produced within the jurisdiction of the Basra Court (less than half) by an attachment order. (v) In 1946 this attachment order was suddenly cancelled (by the same judge, I believe, who made it,and on grounds of the doubtful meaning of a phrase in the text). It appears to be generally believed - and I have no doubt of it - that the judge was either bribed or acting under some other extra-judicial influence. The Shaikh’s lawyers have stated that he has been given another appointment with higher pay. (vi) There seems to be no method by which the Shaikh can secure in 1947 the proprietor’s share which he enjoyed uninterruptedly up to 1942, and that in spite of the fact that the land was legally registered in 1944 nKiin 1944 as the property of the heirs of Shaikh Tahir (whom he represents). It seems to me that the applicability or otherwise of the 6 , 1914 guarantees need not be considered. We should do for the Shaikh what we would do for any other British subject who might be the victim of injustice in a foreign country; and we should , not forget that the fate of the Shaikh’s gardens is closely watched in countries other than Kuwait and Iraq;, where it is well known that he relies upon His Majesty’s Government to protect him and his rights. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, KuwaitBritish embassy, Bagdad. 1282/19/46 23rd December, 1946 I ^as not altogether unprepared for your express letter ho 971 -S of November 11th last concerning the Shaikh of Kowait*s dxite gardens at Basra* I had already learntfrom His Majesty ’g s^onaul General tliere that the Shaikh’s shore of this year's date crop had been lost to him by the manoeuvres of the tenants' lawyer and the matter was recently mentioned to the Counsellor of this ^nbassy by the Sheikh •Ad Major Tandy. On hie return to Basra Mr* Busk learnt from Judga Good thnt he had been instructed by the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to make an enquirv into the matter following a complaint from the Shaikh's lawyer. 2* In his complaint to the inistry of justice the Shaikh's lawyer alleged that the eudge, Andres Asher, who ordered the cancellation of the attachment order on the date crop, had been bribed* trudge Good has completed his investigation and has informed Kls Majesty's Consul General in strict confidence that while there are grave causes for suspicion of Andres Asher's actions the allegations underlying the complaint cannot be proved* I understand that Judge Good has so reported to the i inistry of justice. The senior British Judge in Iraq has also followed this business and has Informed Mr* Busk confidentially that though he agrees with Judge Good's decision that nothing can be proved against Andres Asher, he is arranging with the I inis ter for his transfer from Basra. 3* I must confess that in these circumstances I see no action which I can usefully take* I fear that there is little or no hope of the Shaikh recovering the ID 13000/- which, it is estimated, he has lost. Kvcn if an action at law against the Iraqi authorities had been possible I think that Judge Good's report makes it clear that it would fail. Our efforts, it seems to me, must be directed to securing the Shaikh's position for the future. I shall continue to press the i inistry of Justice to have the appeals by the tenants against the hand Settlement decisions decided* And as I understand that s comparatively small number of decisions will dispose of nearly all the 2764 cases I have hopes that the most unfortunate occurrence of this year will not be repented* 4- I am sending cox^ies of this despatch to the Political ^gent at Aowait, Hie A&amp;jo&amp;ty's Consul General nt Basra, to the External affairs Department in Hew jelhi and to the itoreign Office.

After Complima in + C! , I am enclosing a letter from the two lawyers in which they have given their opinion regarding the Bao case, and a copy of the application to be sub mitted to the Ministry of Interior after having obtained Your Highness 1 approval of whichever of al- r ternatives Your Highness prefers. The lawyer req uests the assistance of our friends ( British Govt.) with the Minister of Interior after Your Highness has approved one of the alternatives. Usual F.n rHri ' T .Translation of an application to be submitted to the Iraqi I^inister of Interior, Baghdad, by H.H*s lawyers. To The Hon’ble the Minister of Interior, Baghdad, PLAIN TIffg . His Highness Shaiich Ahmed al-Jabir as-Subah , and all the^eirs of Shaikh Jabir bin Abdulla as- Subah, whoop ^^puties are Hasan Abdulrahman “'nd Abdulrahman al-Umar, the lawyers. APPEAL . The plots of date gardens Nos.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 &amp; 28 of the Fao Area No.6 are the prc^crty of the plaintiffs, His Highness Shaikh Ahmed al-Jabir as-Subah and his co-sharers, the heirs of Shaikh Jabir Abdulla as-Subah and have been for a long time. The Land Rights Committee of Basra Liwa has issued decisions which were published in ' Waqaye’ al-Iraqia Gazette ' of 21st February, 1944, under No. 2166 and serial No. 1797 confirming this ownership by the plaintiffs. During the years following the issue of the said decision the tenants of these plots of land began seizing the crop and taking it by force, for the purpose of causing damage to my client and his colleagues. The plaintiffs used to ask for precautionary attachment which was sometimes enforced and sometimes cancelled on some formal pretext having no bearing on the subject of ownership, as the owner ship of these plots belongs to the plaintiffs,and their right of disposal is admitted by the law. As the custom of the land-owners r ' r p ^ra Liwa authorizes the land-rmer to maintain armed guards in his gardens during the harvest season for the purpose of protecting the crops from the tenants and any other who may try to steal the harvest, my clients have therefore decided to enjoy this right this year, 1947, during the harvest season, becau^o that is the QjiPy way the plaintiffs can obtain the crops of their property. As the farmers in these plots of land used to loot the crops during the past years, they may create some trouble against the guards on the property of my clients. In order to prevent any trouble that may disturb security at Fao, I submit this application to Your Honour requesting that the administrative authorities concerned should ta^e security from the tenants to keep in peace and not to interfere with the guards. The tenants* claim for their full share as cultivators *ill be reserved regularly and according to local custom.Translation of a copy of letter dated, the 30th March, 1947 from Hasan Abdulrahruan and Abdulrahm^n al-Umar, the lawyers, Basra, to Sh« Mohammad al-Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, Basra. After Compliments, I am enclosing herewith two copies of the application which I consider it necessary to submit to the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad for the purpose of opening discussions on the question of appointing guards on your behalf in the date gardens of Fao so that the crop will not be made away with as happens every year. This is the system which will protect the rights of His Highness your father and his partners far better than the system of precautionary attach ment. I request you to let me know as soon as possible whether you agree to the submission and prosecution of this document in Baghdad. It is necessary that you exert yourself in this prosecution so that we may obtain a satisfactory result. In case you do not agree to the submission of the application and you insist on following the previous system of asking the precautionary attachment of the crops, I suggest that the attachment be as follows 1, We must ask for attachment on behalf of all the clients whose names are mentioned in the two Powers of Attorney given to both of u~. 2, The parties against whom the attachment is applied for are the tenants in each of the date gardens mentioned with their numbers in the decision of the Land Settlement Committee, published in ” Waqaye* al-Iraqia Gazette. H 3, The purpose of asking for the attachment is to seize the produce of each date-garden separately, i.e. we will ask for precautionary attachment of every piece of land separately. Uiis conforms with the text of the law of legal appeal and also the text of the law of Settlement more than the system followed formerly, i.e. to have the execution ^sked for by some of the heirs against some of the tenants in a small p«rt o** a garden. From this you can see that we must know the names of the tenants in every date-garden separately. I am sub mitting a statement showing the number of the date-gardens, their area, and the date of the publication of uhe decision irTtheir respect. This will assist you to supply me with the above-mentioned names. It is necessary to have a copy of the application for the precautionary attachment printed in a printing press together with a copy of the application for sanctioning the attachment. As this will require a considerable time I request you to treat this matter as urgent and to reply in detail. Usual Ending.

Should His Highness be permitted to follow the normal custom of land-owners in the area and post armed guards over his crops he would probably be successful in obtaining his legal share. It is, however, exceedingly unlikely that he would be granted this permission unless the Embassy intervened on his behalf, i should be grateful to know, for His Highness T information whether this would be possible. Should it be so the Shaikh will endeavour to employ Iraqi guards. 5.

I discussed the Foa case at length with Iskander Mansur, Judge Prood, ShaiKh Mohammed As-Subah and the Consul- general when 1 I was in Basrah at the end of October. Briefly the present impasse appears to have arisen as follows:- Up to 1942 the Mutasarif of Basrah, in his executive capacity, arranged for the division of the produce between the owners of the gardens and the fellaheen under his supervision. In 1943, however, the fellaheen T s lawyer, who appears to have considerable influence in the right quarters in Baghdad, secured a ruling from the Ministry of the Interior to the effect that the Mutasarif should not interfere in the case as it was suySudice before the Land Settlement Board. As a result of this order the fellaheen succeeded in getting away with a good deal of the produce in 1943. In 1944,after Isxander Mansur had gone to a good deal of trouble and expense to secure the 1944' crop by securing an order of attachment from the Court, and had had bailiff^ appointed to safeguard the Shaikh f s interest, the fellaheen’s lawyer — who A appears/appears to rely on champerty for a living — succeeded^ in securing an abrogation of the attachment order and withdrawal of the bailiffs. The fellaheen were then'able to smuggle away most of the crop without- surrendering the landlord’s share to His Highness' agents — vide Consul- general^ Basrah^P.L. dated 28th October, 1944. Judge Oood explained that the fellaheen’s lawyer succeeded in upsetting tne attachment order on two grounds: firstly, that the &lt; 0 ooun lanes of the gardens were insufficiently described; and secondly, that the power of attorney was invalid because it was in the name of His Highness instead of the 'Heirs of Jal'' The remedy suggested was for the Shaikh's lawyer to get a valid power of attorney and a more complete description of the boundaries. A valid power of attorney involved making a division between the 'Heirs of Jabir’ which His Highness has all along refused to do because he fears that it would lead to many dispos'sessed heirs claiming their rights, shaiich Mohammed, His Highness' agent in Basrah, urged His Highness to make a provisional division among loyal relatives which' would suffice for a power of attorney and attachment this year pending a more permanent- arrangement. Such a division could if necessary,be upset later by appeal by loyal relatives. Having, as Kuler, taken over the whole property, and having muscled out all but his closest relatives, His Highness does not want to have his power over his relatives undermined’ by a shara^ut. If there is any political motive in the Iraqi Court’s decision, it is a desire to undermine his power in just this way. * i mentioned to His Highness that Shaikh Mohammed’s suggestion appeared to offer the only chance of saving the 1944 crop, and that I should try to get the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior to help him for 1945. His Highness, however, appeared to have lost interest, and was unwilling to adopt Shaikh Mohammed's suggestion end had nothing else to suggest. I did not therefore pursue the matter beyond mentioning it to Lmgeman of the Embassy when he was down here. He suggested that/DEPARTMENT/OFF K2:. ) liie eiorgndkH w N«. Sa?ki N* . i.

It contains correspondence, memoranda and legal papers regarding lawsuits brought against the Shaikh of Kuwait [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] by the heirs of the former owners of the Al Faddaghiyeh, Al Bashiyah and Al Fao properties, and efforts on behalf of the Shaikh to reclaim the properties or seek compensation for their loss.

The papers also discuss: the Shaikh's court appeal seeking return of the purchase money for Bashiyah property, and later attempts to bid for the land at auction; and changes in the Shaikh's legal representation at Basra.The file primarily consists of correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and the Political Agent at Kuwait. It also contains copies of correspondence between the Shaikh of Kuwait (Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ), the Shaikh's son and acting representative in Basra (Shaikh Muḥammad Āl Ṣabāḥ), the Shaikh's secretary (Abdulla Mulla Saleh) and the Shaikh's lawyers (Sulaiman Faidhi, Iskandar Mansur, and Hasan Abdul Rahman), as well as copies of outgoing letters to them.The file contains the following legal documents and case notes (English translations unless otherwise stated):Court of Appeal decision regarding the Bashiyah, f 65.English and Arabic copies of a court document regarding the Fao properties, ff 90-91.Estimates of the present and pre-war values of the Shaikh's land at Bashiyah, ff 120-121.English and Arabic copies of inheritance documents issued by the Sharia Court of Kuwait, plus Power of Attorney documents, ff 124-132, 136-139, 140-142, 152-155, 192-205, and 325-331.An updated précis of the date garden lawsuits and their status at the time, ff 262-264.A précis of proceedings and Government correspondence regarding the date gardens, ff 276-278, and 333.The correspondence is continued under reference IOR/R/15/5/155.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Muḥammad Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Basrah</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><subject><topic>Taxation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000068#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
