Khelat, 21th August 1870. S ir, I haxe the honor to report for your information that, by the advice of my Medical attendant, I proceeded to Iskulkote eight miles from Khelat, intending to be absent until the following Tuesday ; Doctor Bowman being of opinion that I required quiet and freedom from all official duties for a few days.( 7 ) 2. I am sorry to say that, late on Thursday evening, I heard that His Highness had adjudicated in a case of forcible abduction and rape, in a manner that has caused me the greatest regret. The usual punishmont for crime of this sort, is death, but His High ness on his own responsibility directed that the man should be casterated. So short a time elapsed between the sentence and execution, that neither the Shagassee nor any one else had time to interfere. 3. I have expressed my disgust at the proceeding both to Shagassee Wullee Maho med and Naib Mahomed Khan, and by at once returning to Khelat, have shown His Highness that I am greatly displeased. 4. His Highness has given me the following explanation through Shagassee Wullee Mahomed :— ' That the man was a private servant of his at Mungoochur, and taking advantage of ' his position, went armed to a man's house, and having threatened to cut him down, carried ' off his wife. That the injured husband came direct to him and claimed his protection. ' that he enquired into the case in open Durbar, that the Cazee recommended him to be ' stoned or hanged, and thus comply with the Mahomedan or Belooch law. That taking ' into consideration that the man was one of his retainers, he was most anxious every one ' should see that the man's position would not save him, and that a punishment had been ' selected, to strike awe into the minds of other evil-doers, and thus protect the honor of ' harmless and well behaved subjects,' 5. The case is no doubt a flagrant one, but I shall tell His Highness this evening that barbarity of this kind will meet with no sympathy or approval amongst civilized people, and shall show him how distasteful this mode of punishment has been to me. I have, &amp;c. C. W. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat. Ko. 1242 of 1870. Political Department. From, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. To, The Political Agent, Khelat.
