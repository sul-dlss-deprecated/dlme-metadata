At the top of the one decorated surface is a \"shen\"-sign flanked by \"wadjet\"-eyes. Below, on the left, are a man and a woman seated upon a lion-legged chair. The woman, seated behind the man, wears a lappet wig. The man wears a bobbed wig, and holds a lotus to his nose. The two figures face a small offering table. On the other side of the table stands a man holding a sistrum (?) in one hand, and pouring a libation onto the table with his other hand. Behind this figure, and overlapping it slightly, is the representation of a woman, seated, and holding a lotus flower to her nose. Above User-pehety-nisu and Panether is an inscription. Below these figures are three lines of hieroglyphs. The stela is unfinished: there is no carving of the pupil on the right-hand \"wadjet\"-eye. The technique used for the hieroglyphs is a crude plain-incised relief. The raised relief is rather flat. There are traces of red paint in some of the hieroglyphs. There are traces of brown paint on the seated man and woman. On the lotus which the man holds there are traces of orange color. There are traces of reddish paint on the field near the \"shen\"-sign.\r\nCondition: Large chips out of sides; front surface flaked off behind chair; large chip at front of lowest line of text.", "medium": "Limestone", "dimensions": "14 1/2 x 9 3/4 x 2 15/16 in.
