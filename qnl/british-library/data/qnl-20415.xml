Iraq Government request me to convey this in vitation to Bin SaudS Snds. Priiife Minister explained Faisal is very anxious to try and dissipate present atmosphere of distrust between Iraq and Najd Governments 'by personal meeting with Bin Saud and would be glad if I could take gpart in conference which would pro- 'bahly he attended 'by Prime Minister and Gornwallis. Matters- 2 - Matters now for discussion include : (a) Disposal of rebel refugees; ('b) Eeturn of loot; (c) Breach of Article 4 ofBahrah Agreement; 0(d) Extradition; (e) Treaty bon voisinage ; (f) Mutut^l recognition of two Groverninents which is regarded as most important of all # Prima facie I am in favour of this pro posal as feeling of hostility 'between Iraq, and Najd could hardly 'be worse and these seems a chance that even if conference fails to solve any outstanding questions, way might 'be prepared 'by personal contact for a better mutual understanding.

IMMKDIATS, E.M^s. Government feel considerable appre- -hension as to the effect on I'bn Saud of the line referred to in your telegram No. 104 of 12tl:i February regarding the disposal of Il)n : asliur. Importance of meeting between I'bn Saud and Paisal in a friendly atmostphere is so great alike from point of view of future relations 'between Iraq, and Nejd and from that of H.M's. Government themselves, and the refusal of Ihn Saua to persevere with meeting owing to dispute over this relatively small matter would 'be so unfortunate that they regard it as desirable to make all possible efforts to reach an understanding with him. From a different standpoint they would be placed in a most embarrassing position vis a vis Ibn Saud if the Iraa Gov- -ernment persist in their present uncompromising attitude. While it is perhaps arguable that the case of Ibn Mashur is not expressly covered by the terms of pledges given by the Iraq. Government, H.. *s. Government feel that it would A be most difficult to contend that the guarantees given by them in November as to the expulsion of the 'contending forces' and 'concerting of necessary military measures' for that end do not apply to his case. H.K r s. Government's own inclination would be to hand over Ibn Mashur subject to the same guarantees as were obtained in the case of the other rebel leaders, t They have no objection however to the Iraq Government J endeavouring to use Ibn Mashur as a bargaining counter for securing satisfactory settlement of Dhaffir and Dahamshah. Nevertheless * ^ 7 &gt; 61 /14 A 61/20, P. Secretary of State for Colonies, London. High Commissioner, Baghdad, Ho» 85. Political Resident, Bushire, No. 39, H.M*s. Charge d 9 Affaires, Jeddah, No. 36.Nevertheless it should be realised ^hat the Iraq Government have no claim under Arti 4 of the Bahra Agreement to the expulsion of the Shaikhs of these trihes. dn the other hand, the demand for the Mizyad surrender of Ihn atacarkgg is, in their opinion, wholly un- -justifiable as 'being direotly contrary to Art. I of the Bahra Agreement, which expressly provides that punishment for raiding should 'be administered 'by the Grovernment to which the raiders are subjects. It does not provide for the handing over 'by the Nejd Government to Irat of Nejdi offenders which, other considerations apart, would 'be likely to lead to em'barx*assing counter claims from Nejd. In the circumstances you should inform the while Iraq, Government that^H, 1 1 s. Crovernment are prepared to support the Iraq Government in endeavouring to obtain satisfactory settlement as regards the Dhafir and Dahamshah Shaikhs, although not necessarily as a condition to the handing over of Ibn Mashur, they are definitely unable to support the demand for the surrender of Ibn izyad and you should use your utmost endeavours to induce the Iraq. Gov- -ment to substitute a demand that Ibn Gaud should inflict '♦severe punishment 1 * upon him and his followers, which would be in accordance with Art. I of the Bahra Agreement. If nevertheless the Iraq Government persist in maintaining a wholly uncompromising attitude as regards Ibn Mizyad and thus jeopardise the prospects of a satis- -factory settlement with Ibn Saud, H.M's. Government may find it necessary to instruct you to dissociate yourself from their action and you should warn Iraq acco dingly. SBORSTAEY QY STATS FOH THIS COLONIES.

Iraq Government were in Incensed at reports that he was in high favour with Bin Saud in whose train he was said to De riding Iraq she oaiaels. 9. X propose with^ them to confine tUeir demand in his case to request for adequate punishment. With regard to Ihn Mashhur I agree that if meetings of Kings were to be abandoned on his account it would be moat unfortunate, but I should find it very difficult to persuade Faisal to abandon his chier bargaining counter in advance of meeting and blame should rest on Bin Saud if he wrecks the conference on this point. Faisal himself suggested to me the other day that no useful purpose would be served by his meeting Ibn Saud unless latter agreed befor hand to his attitude about desert posts. I dissuaded him from adopting: this attitude and suggest Ibn 3aud SDould be similarly dissuaded it he attempts to uiake his own attendence at meeting conditional on prior argument to surrender of Ibn Mashhur. Present position is that preliminary conference which was i^umfobut unfruitful has broken up. ielegrams from Iraij delegation indicate that question of Kashur was raised only at first axailisx of three meetings and not pressed. Nejd delegates left Kuwait February 14th to j in Ibn saud, who is apparentlyapparently moving south to enTbark February 20tli at Has Tanurah for meeting.

IMPORTANT . Your telegram No# 102. I am very grateful for your congratulations. Conference has enabled the two Kings to understand, each others difficulties. Each affirmed both public and in private that he was convinced of genuine desire of His Majesty^ Government to promote harmony between their two States and that such harmony could only be effectively secured through British advice and guidance. If they fulfil promise which they made to me that each would go a considerable distance to meet the expectations of the other, I feel that conference, which has caused great enthusiasm locally, will be fruitful of enduting benefit to both countries. If on the other hand either King falls short of what is understood by the other to have undertaken re sults may be that little real progress has been made. So far as ion Saud is concerned he professes to place his reliance upon His Majesty's Government rather than upon King Paisal. His signature to the letter on the subject of desert Posts was only obtained at the last moment at a private interview with myself when he expressed himself as basing his hope for future peace in Arabia on British impartiality and justice. As a first step I am pressing King Faisal to ensure that ibn Mashur and his followers should be re-returned to Uajd as soon as possible and have pointed out that this will be regarded by ibn Saud as a test of good f ai tiu HIGH COMMISSIONER - f. ***Post copy to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

Political A &amp;ent, Bahr4i^J To The Hon 1 ble Lt.Col.H-V.Biscoe I.A. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to say that H.M.Bin Saud, iQng of TTejd and the Hedjaz, arrived at Bahrain on the 25th Febru ary and left Bahrain for Ojair on the same day. Shaikh Hamad late the preceding night, requesting Shaikh Isa to come to Manama so that the King might see him, stating that he had no time to spare. The Residents telegram advising him not to visit Bahrain was received next day, and Shaikh Hamad was informed that he had given up his idea of visiting Bahrain 'but the Shaikh, who had 'been cruising about the harbour since a very early hour, no sooner saw the Patrick Stewart than he dashed off to the ship without a word to the Political Agent or Adviser. It must be remet%ed that Ibn Saud has the same effect on Shaikh Hamad that Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse \ might have had on some petty German princeling like Schaumberg Lippe, or the Basileus of the Persian empire on xaisg the ' turannos 1 of some Greek islet, and he is meymers^ied by him. to the shore, and both on the steamer and on the launch His Majesty confined himself to generalities, and he and all his 1 entourage were markedly reticent regarding the Lupin conferen ce. He said, however, that he had never aspired to be king of an the Arabs, but that he was quite content with his king dom of Nejd, and that if a better man than he were forthcoming 2. Two telegrams had arrived for Shaikh Isa and 3. He and his two brothers accompanied the Kin,page 2. he would gladly hand over the reins to him. He had 'been obli ged to crush the rebels as he felt that itnwas in the interests of the country. 4. Scenes of great disorder marked the landing. Mr de Gren- ler, who considers he has an ex-officio right to be at the top of the pier steps and welcome distinguished visitors, was moving to his post, when the Amir of Manama, a colourless non entity who supports himself by sponging on Shaikh Hamad and who ekes out his stipend by a private tax on prostitutes, rudely told him to get off the pier. Mr de Grenier, to whom the Cus toms ,„nr its pier is more than a cherished mistress, was beside himself with fury, but controlling himself with difficulty, told him that the pier was in his charge and that he would, if he saw fit,have the Amir t^ned off. The Amir replied that they were meeting an Arab and not an Englishmen, and he appear ed to consider Mr de Grenier's presence superfluous. / tv . i 5 V 0,1 landin g» the King received an ovation. The whole t-jhe Indian guarci of honour vainly trying to present .arms were pier, crowoea wita some 5000 persons, ratr-rTor:-^ &lt;t ^' |^d of nature casting aside all pretence at order, swarmed round o,,ua liring off their rifles, fhe crowd,composed of principally of Arabs and STejdis, nearly trod the al Khalifa Shaikhs under foot in their frantic attempts to shake the royal hand. Getting into a car with great difficulty, the King pro ceeded in triumph to the Palace, where he greeted Shaikh Isa, and the veteran ruler is reported to have said that having seen the King he could now die in peace. 6. The King had accepted Shaikh Hamad's invitation to stay the night at Sakhir, and he proceeded there almost immed-- diately, pausing to hold a We at the Qusaibis house at Rifaa which was attended by all the al&amp;alifa shaikhs and the nota- - bles of the island. Upon arrival at Sakhir, however, he sudden- changed his mind, and proceeding to Zilag embarked for Ojair the same afternoon. 7. The whole effect of his visit has been deplorable.Pag e 3. more successful impetus to Pan-Arab feeling could not have been given, and the tenuity of our hold on Bahrain could not have 'been more clearly demonstrated. In view of the excite ment caused by this visit, another, at a time charged with com munal tens^ion might have incalculable results, and it is to be hoped that Bin Saud will not again be allowed to approach closer to Bahrain than Qatif. The futility of the al Khalifa shaikhs in their own dominions has been amply demonstrated, and the Q,usaibis, powerful already, have had their prestige imme^urably enhanced. Bin Saud realises now, if he did not before, that it is only the force of our arms that prevents Bahrain welcoming him as King, and that if his wishes regarding it are not acce- 'S c ded to, that it our influnce and not the Bahrain Government that is to blame.

Ijjlu Charge d*Affaires.S7 ♦ (81) L etter feom the H on '^le the P olitical R ksiden T in the P ersian No. 105-S. of 1930, dated the 17 th M arch 1930. In amplification of my telegraiii No. 200, dated the 26th February 1930 [Serial No. (76)], I liave the honour to submit a further report regarding the visit of King Bin Satid to Bahrain. 2, On the conclusion of the meeting King Bin Saud left ostensibly tfor Kas Tanura where, as a matter of fact, the Commander of the ^ Patrick Stewart ' had put down two buoys to facilitate his return. However, on his way down the coast he sent two wireless messages to Shaikh Isa and Shaikh Hamad, reqne-sting the former to meet him at Manama. When this was reported to the Commander of the ' Patrick Stewart ' he at once sent me a telegram asking for instructions and I told him to inform Bin Baud that a visit at slich short notice Would l)e inconvenient and suggesting that he should proceed direct by launch to Oqair repeating the message to Bahrain. T received a reply that Bin Saud had entirely given up his intention of visiting Bahrain, and would proceed direct to Oqair. T hoped therefore that no meeting between Bin Saud and the Shaikh of Bahrain would take place, as the outer buoy where Bin Saud would have disembarked is twelve miles from the port (not seven as stated in my telegram) [Serial No. (76)] and out of sight. TJnfortunately however the weather was exceedingly bad, and no boats could come out to the outer buoy and the Commander of the ' Patrick Stewart ' had no option but to go in to the inner anchorage. The Political Agent had informed Shaikh Hamad on receipt of my telegram that Bin Saud would not visit Bahrain, but no sooner did the 11 Patrick Stewart' come into sight than he at once proceeded on board. In describing the incident Captain Prior remarks that '' it must be remembered that Bin Saud has the same effect on Shaikh Hamad that Kaiser Wilhelm might have had on some petty German princeling like Schaumberg Lippe, and he is mesmerised hj hiin 3. The King came ashore accompanied by the Shaikh and his two brothers, and was given a great ovation on arrival by an enthusiastic crowd, composed largely of his own subjects, and proceeded to the palace, where he received Shaikh Isa. The Political Agent reports that he was markedly reticent about his recent meeting with King Faisal and refused to discuss the subject. After greeting Shaikh Isa, the King proceeded almost immediately to Shaikh Hamad's house at Sakhir, some ten miles from Manama, pausing at the Qusaibi's house en route to receive some of the A1 Khalifa Shaikhs and notables of the islands. He had accepted an invitation from38 Siiaikh Hamad to stay the night, but on arrival at Saldiir he suddenly changed his mind, and proceeding to Zilag embarked for Oqair the same afternoon, 4. Prom the foregoing it will be seen that Biij Baud apparently anticipated that objections would be raised to his visiting Bahrain : the ship would in any case have had to go to the outer buoy at Bahrain in order to get a bearing for Has Tanura, and I think there is no doubt that Ms v intention was to stop the ship when he gpt there and go ashore before the matter could have been reported to me or anyone else. Captain Marr of the ' Patrick Stewart ' told me that he was very displeased when he found that his intention had been reported to me, and I think that had weather permitted, once he knew that his intention had been discovered, he would certainly have gone to Oqair direct. The weather however was so bad that night that Captain Marr thought he would have to try and seek shelter on the Persian coast and give up the idea of making Bahrain till the gale abated : ultimately he decided to hold on, but of course on arrival at the outer buoy it was impossible to disembark there, and there was nothing to be done but go on to the inner buoy. However, having landed, Bin Saud did leave as sj^on as he reasonably could. 5. The Political Agent considers that the effects of the visit were bad and that it has given an impetus to pan-Arab sentiment and has much enhanced the prestige of the powerful Qusaibi family. I should have preferred that the visit had not taken place but I am inclined to think that Captain Prior is perhaps unduly pessimistic and that whatever the effects of the visit may have been they will prove to be of a transient nature. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies and to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jeddah.

In the letters exchanged the Kings have undertaken to attempt to settle this question by agreement during the next six months, and failing agreement to refer the question to arbitration. The Kings further agreed to set up a special Tribunal under the presidency of a British Political Officer in Koweit next June to adjudicate upon claims for trans-frontier raiding. fhe question of the disposal of a small party of tribesmen, who after being associated in the recent rebellion against Ibn Saud entered Iraq territory last December, was also discussed and satisfactorily settled.

I have the honour to invite a reference to telegram No. 2300, dated the 24tli February 1930, from His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, regarding the conference of the two Kings. 2. In paragraph 2 of that telegram His Excellency the High Com missioner reported that both the'Kings had agreed that a tribunal for the adjudication of claims in accordance with the provisions of the Bahra agreement should assemble at Kuwait in June under the presidency of either Colonel Dickson or Major Fowle as might be decided by Hk Majesty's Government. 3. For the reasons given in my telegram No. 40 of the 22nd February [Serial No. (40)], I consider that it would be preferable that Colonel Dickson should not preside : on the other hand Major Powle has a good knowledge of the language and some judicial training, has served in Iraq, Aden and other Arabian ports, and could of course avail himself of Colonel Dickson's local knowledge of tribal customs, etc., if necessary. Further, I could make his services available for the purpose any time during the summer, as Captain Russell could act temporarily as Secretary as he did last summer. I trust therefore that His Majesty's Government will agree to his appointment as president of the tribunal. 4. It would seem desirable however that certain points of procedure and tribal custom should be clarified before the tribunal is convened, irrespective of the question of who is to be president, and Major Fowle has prepared a note on such points as have occurred to him which I for ward herewith for the consideration of His Majesty's Government. 5. It would certainly seem desirable in order to avoid subsequent delay that an agreement regarding these matters should be arrived at be fore the tribunal assembles, and I would therefore venture to suggest that, if His Majesty's Government see no objection, the two Governments should be invited to exchange lists of their claims as soon as possible and to say whether they agree to the procedure outlined in the draft note at page 36 ;of Colonial Office Print Middle East No. 28 being followed mutatis mutandis by the proposed tribunal under the Bahra agreement. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, His Excellency the'High Commissioner for Iraq, and His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jeddah- ^ Enclosure to Serial No. (84). (Note dated the 12th March 1930, by Major T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., Secretary to the Hon'ble the Pomtical Resident in the Persian Gulf.) 'Suggestions regarding procedure for the Iraq-Nejd Special (Bahra) Tribunal, With regard to the Special Tribunal to be convened under Article 2 of the Bahra Agreement, in view of the fact that the Tribunal has not been held before, that therefore there are no precedents as to procedure, and that—so far as I am aware—no such procedure has been laid down, I venture to make the following tentative suggestions which may possibly save time, avoid unnecessary friction, and preclude the referring to the President of questions which it will be outside his competence to decide. I should like to emphasise the fact that the making of these suggestions in no way compromises the position of the neutral President, since they cannot come into force unless both parties agree to them. 2. Unless such action has already been taken, in order that both parties may have previous knowledge of the claims to be preferred against47 tliem, I suggest that they might forthwith exchange a list of these claims '—with as full details as possible—to cover the period from the 1st Novem ber 1927, (the date from which claims are to* be admitted), up to (say) 28th February 1930 or any other date mutually agreed on. As the date of the tribunal is not yet fixed a second list might be exchanged a month before the meeting of the Tribunal, covering the period from the 28th February 1930 up to the date on which the second lists are exchanged. Copies of these lists might be forwarded to the President so that he could make himself conversant with the questions involved before the Tribunal opens, i 3 An excbaBge of claims as suggested above, would also serve to settle the important point of what claims the parties concerned are pre pared to submit to arbitration, and what they are not.

S. 'Lupin'. M. I.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT, EASTERN (Arabia). April 25, 1930. CONFIDENTIAL, Section 1. [E 2171/111/91] No. 1. Sir F. Humphry s to Lord Pass field.—{Communicated hy Colonial Office, April 25.) Mv Lord, Bagdad, March 15, 1930. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on the meeting of King Faisal with King Ibn Saud on board H.M.S. ' Lupin ' in the Persian Gulf on the 22nd and 23rd of February, 1930. 2. Arrangements had been made for the steamship ' Patrick Stewart to pick up King Ibn Saud at Has Tanurah on the 20th February, and the King had been requested to limit the number of his followers to fifty. Actually, he brought a surte of 118, and, in spite of the captain's protests, insisted on embarking his whole company and a large quantity of stores. King Faisal embarked at Basra on the evening of the 21st February on board the ' Nearchus,' a ship of about 1,500 tons, which is owned by the Iraq Goyernment. He was accompanied by a suite of twelye persons including Naji Pasha-al-Suwaidi, the Prime Minister, and Sir Kinahan Gornwallis. I embarked myself on the same eyenmg with Air Vice-Marshal bir Robert Brooke-Popham on H.M.S. ' Lupin.' ^ 3. The rendezvous, which was 15 miles out to sea beyond the moutn oi tne Shatt-al-Arab, was reached by all three ships in the early hours of the 22nd February, and we anchored in line about 400 yards apart with H.M.S. ' Lupm ' m the centre. After I had ascertained that my suggested programme for the conference was acceptable to both Kings, arrangements were made for their Majesties to board the c ' Lupin ' at three minutes' interval under a salute of twenty-one guns e a ch- King Ibn Saud was the first to come aboard accompanied by his two principal Ministers, flafiz Wahba and Fuad Hamza, his private secretary, Yusuf Yasm and three others. King Faisal followed with a suite of the same number, and I brought the two Kings together on the quarter-deck. They seemed to eye one another with a mixture oi curiosity and suspicion, but embraced in Arab fashion with every outward appearance of cordiality. After each King had introduced the members of his suite to the other, a move was made to the captain's cabin, which Commander Sir John Alleyne had kindly placed at my disposal for the conference. 1 he two Kings sat down side by side on a sofa and, after a few polite courtesies had been exchanged, I welcomed them in the name of His Majesty's Government and said that it had given much pleasure to my Government to be the means of lacilitating a meeting which they confidently hoped would result in the strengthening of the ties of friendship between the two Arab States and in the dissipation of any misunder standings which had occurred in the past. Each King in reply expressed his appreciation of the endeavours of His Britannic Majesty s Government to further the cause of friendship between Nejd and Iraq, and to the generous thought which had prompted them to bring about on board one of His Britannic Majesty s ships a meeting which would otherwise have been so difficult to arrange. 4. After about half-an-hour's desultory talk, King Faisal, contrary to the plan which had been arranged between us, made a lengthy statement on Iraq-JNe]d relations, finally leading up to the disagreement on the subject of the desert posts and enlarging on their pacific purpose and proved usefulness m the maintenance ot order among the Bedouin tribes. King Ibn Saud gave this speech a patient and impassive hearing, but, when it was finished, he said it was not his wish that the friendliness of the meeting should be marred by the intrusion of controversial discussions. He went on to say that he had made it a condition of his acceptance ot the invitation to attend the meeting that no formal negotiations should be attempted. I took this to mean that King Ibn Saud had no intention of discussing details m the presence of the Neid and Iraqi Ministers, and I arranged for them to withdraw and leave the two Kings alone with myself and Captain Holt, my oriental secretary. The conversations were continued till evening without a result being achieved m any direction. The Ministers were instructed to form themselves into a committee to discuss the details of all outstanding difficulties, while the two Kings opened their hearts to each other and confined themselves to questions of principle. [84 bb—1] B5. Much to my surprise, King Ibn Saud had accepted my invitation to luncheon, although it was the month of Ramazan, and proceeded to eat a hearty meal and make himself extremely agreeable. In the evening he invited us all to dine with him on board the ' Patrick Stewart.' The approach to the dining saloon, which was rigged up on deck with canvas and decorated with the flags of the three countries, was between two lines of African negroes dressed in scarlet and gold and armed to the teeth. It was cunningly arranged that we should traverse the whole ship before arriving at the saloon so that the entire force of 110 retainers should be displayed before the eyes of King Faisal and the guests, and the scene, owing to the gigantic height and barbaric splendour of the bodyguard, was most impressive. We were then entertained to an Arab feast which surpassed in the copious variety of its dishes anything I had experienced before. Twelve sheep roasted whole were placed upon the table, while the intervening spaces were crammed with meats of wonderful variety and flavour. King Ibn Saud started the proceedings by breaking the ribs of the sheep opposite with his clenched fist and ladling out the contents of its stomach on to my plate with his hands. This delicate attention. His Majesty informed me, was a sign that he wished the bond of friendship, which we had just begun to form, to be permanent. 6. On the following morning, the conference was resumed on board the ' Lupin ' at 9-30 and, while the committee of Ministers were engaged in examining the draft of a Bon-Voisinage Agreement, 1 discussed with the two Kings the conclusion of an arbitral convention on the subject of the desert posts. The crux of the problem was found to be the nomination of a fifth arbitrator to give the casting vote when, as was assumed to be inevitable, the four Nejd and Iraqi representatives were unable to reach an agreement. It was clear that neither King relished the risk of the award going against him. I suggested that, in case of disagreement, the presiding arbitrator should be nominated by the British Government. King Ibn Saud opposed this suggestion, on the ground that, His Majesty's Government having already declared their views on the question of the interpretation of article 3 of the Ujair Protocol at his meeting with the late Sir Gilbert Clayton, any arbitrator nominated by them would share their view and would be unable to approach the question with an open and unbiassed mind. He admitted that the posts were quite harmless to Nejd, but said he had pledged himself to his people that he would never consent to their remaining, and he could not go back on his word. The posts at Sulman and Shabichah, he maintained, were indisputably sited on watering-places which were recognised throughout the desert as being the rightful resort of the Nejdi tribes, and Busaiyah, he contended, was sited on such bad water that sooner or later the Iraq Government would be compelled to move the post elsewhere. He suggested a compromise and, in an aside, he assured me that nothing should be done to interfere with the proper protection of the trans-desert oil pipeline. He then reverted to the question of the presiding arbitrator and said that he should be an Arab. King Faisal was opposed to this, on the ground that no Arab fit for this task could be found who would not be either under his own or King Ibn Saud's influence. 7. As neither King showed any signs of budginsf from his own standpoint. King Faisal withdrew, and I was left alone with King Ibn Saud. I travelled over again with him all the arguments on the subject of the desert posts, and pointed out how unsatisfactory it would be to re-open negotiations for settlement without making provision for arbitration in default of agreement. I said that I was amazed to hear that His Majesty was unable to trust the impartiality of my Government in the matter of the nomination of a presiding arbitrator. Upon this, he turned suddenly to face me and, dramatically striking his chest, said that he 'agreed that the British Government should nominate any one they chose as the fifth arbitrator, but asked that, before the matter was referred to arbitration, the parties should try once more during the next six months to find a solution which would be acceptable to both sides. At this point King Faisal returned, and the Ministers were sent for and were instructed to draw up this decision in suitable documentary form. 8. I next opened with the two Kings the subject of the disposal of Ibn Mashhur. At Bagdad, Faisal had always declared to me that he did not require my help m this matter. Once face to face with King Ibn Saud, he would challenge him to quote a single precedent from Arab history to justify the demand that he was making for the surrender of a fugitive. He had rehearsed the scene before me With arm thrown out, pointing the admonitory finger at an abashed Ibn Saud he would declaim: ' O, Abdul Aziz, tell me, on your honour as an Arab, that you1 3 would do as you ask me to do if you were in my place, and I will agree to surrender Ibn Mashhur/' 'You will see,' he had said to me, 'that Ibn Saud will have to admit that I am right and give up his demand.' Unfortunately, when the moment arrived. His Majesty lost his nerve. The question of Ibn Mashhur had scarcely been opened between us when King Faisal, declaring that this was a question which primarily concerned King Ibn Saud and the British Government, excused himself and withdrew somewhat precipitately to another part of the ship. There was ^ nothing that I could do but to assure King Ibn Saud that the surrender of Ibn Mashhur had never been promised by a representative of my Government, and that the question was one for settlement between himself and King Faisal, which I would do my best to facilitate. I therefore brought the two Kings together again, and, after King Ibn Saud had agreed to pardon Ibn Mashhur, King Faisal remarked that the matter was settled. When pressed by King Ibn Saud to explain, he said that, in view of the pardon, he would not allow Ibn Mashhur to remain in Iraq and would * do his best to induce him to return to Nejd. 9. At this point we all retired to the ' Nearchus,' where King Faisal enter tained the company to luncheon, which, in sharp contrast to the feast on the ' Patrick Stewart ' of the previous evening, was served in European fashion. After luncheon we discussed the settlement of claims for raids committed by Nejdis on Iraqi tribesmen. Both Kings agreed to the convening of a tribunal on the lines of the Bahrah Agreement at Koweit in the month of July, and accepted the suggestion that Major Fowle or Colonel Dickson should be the president of the tribunal. In private, however. King Ibn Saud informed me that he had no confidence whatever ^ that the tribunal would be able to arrive at a settlement satisfactory to both parties, and he asked me to persuade King Faisal to name some reasonable sum which he would be prepared to pay in final settlement of all claims. He reminded me that the Nejdi tribesmen had heavy counter-claims which they would put forward, and said that much acrimonious and indeterminate wrangling would be avoided by fixing a lump sum. I promised to consider this proposal on my return to Bagdad. 10. Meanwhile the Ministers had prepared the draft Bon-Voismage Agree ment, the most important provisions of which were mutual recognition and exchange of diplomatic missions, the principles having been agreed on by the two Kings. It was decided that a further meeting of representatives of both countries would be convened after three months to conclude a formal agreement on the basis of the draft. It was now 5 p.m ., and, as the conference had disposed of all outstanding questions at issue, the Kings bade one another an affectionate farewell and King Ibn Saud returned to the ' Patrick Stewart.' It remained for the Ministers to complete the draft letter which was to be exchanged between the two Kings on the subject of the desert posts. 11. At this stage a most unfortunate contretemfs arose, which seemed at one time to be likely to wreck the success of the conference. The sub-committee of Ministers had agreed to the wording of the draft, a copy of which was typed and brought by Naji Suwaidi about 7 p.m . for King Faisal's signature. It transpired that Naji'Suwaidi, without consulting King Faisal, had inserted the words: ' To His Majesty Ibn Saud, King of the Hejaz and Nejd ' at the beginning of the letter. King Faisal was furious with his Prime Minister for conceding, in a private letter, the principle of recognition, which was meant to be embodied for the first time in the treaty of bon-voisinage, and flatly refused to sign the letter. The Nejdi Ministers were sent for and excitedly declined to agree to the omission of the words ' King of the Hejaz ' from the letter. A stormy scene ensued between the Ministers and King Faisal, and a complete deadlock was reached. As it was now 8 p.m . and the ' Patrick Stewart' was due to sail that night, I had another letter faired and signed by King Faisal, commencing with the words ' My dear brother,' and offered to do my utmost to persuade King Ibn Saud to sign the duplicate. I then proceeded to the ' Patrick Stewart ' and found King Ibn Saud furiously angry at the turn which events had taken. After we had dined, I saw him alone in his cabin, and he told me that he had formed the impression that, in spite of his friendly protestations, King Faisal had determined to play him a trick over the question of recognition and the return of Ibn Mashhur. It was only after two hours' debate, from which the Nejdi Ministers were excluded, that I finally induced King Ibn Saud to sign the letter, and we parted with every expression of friendship. 12. I attach copies of two telegrams exchanged between King Ibn Saud and myself after the meeting. His Majesty's telegram, which was received through the Political Agent at Bahrein, shows clearly the deep concern which King Ibn Saud [84 bb—1] . b 2felt on the two points he considered to be the test of King Faisal's good faith. Happily, one of these points has already been settled, as King Faisal has recently despatched a friendly letter to King Ibn Saud as the sequel to the initialling of the draft of bon-voisinage by the Ministers of Nejd and Iraq at Bagdad, in which he dearly alludes to King Ibn Saud as ' King of the Hejaz and Nejd.' I am pressing King Faisal to secure the early return of Ibn Mashhur and his followers to Nejd, and when this has been done and a lump sum has been agreed upon in full settle ment of the claims of the Iraqi tribesmen against Nejd, I feel that the ground will have been prepared for the settlement of the most important question of all—that of the desert posts. This question has been already brought much nearer to a final settlement by the agreement of both Kings to a nominee of the British Government being appointed as the presiding arbitrator. 13. It is too early yet to say what the effects of the Lupin Conference will be, but the results achieved so far have exceeded my expectations and are a good augury the future. It can at least be claimed that the two Kings, who have hitherto regarded one another with the darkest suspicion, if not with positive abhorrence, have been brought together in a friendly atmosphere and have listened to a frank expression of each other's difficulties and embarrassments. It is, perhaps, not too much to hope that, if nothing spectacular has been achieved, each King will be more ready in future to move some distance towards meeting the point of view of the other. In Bagdad, the conference is frankly acclaimed as a success and as a sign that there is no longer any insuperable obstacle to friendship between the two Arab peoples. professes to take the view that peace and friendship between Nejd and Iraq will still be impossible to maintain without the constant mediation and good omces of the representatives of His Majesty's Government. He made it clear to me, however that, so far as he was concerned, his faith in the genuine desire of Mis Majesty s Government to promote goodwill between the peoples of Arabia had been strengthened by recent events, and that he was ready to place complete reliance on British impartiality and broadmindedness. I feel convinced that the generous hospitality of His Majesty's Government, which made possible the meeting of the wo Kings, will be found to have been well worth while if only because of the personal contact which has been established between them for the first time ■if, .l n conclusion. I wish to express my sincere gratitude for the assistance I received throughout the conference from the captains, officers and crews of the three ^qPs^ch attended the conference.

In this connexion, we thought it fit to bring to your Excellence's notice the matters awaiting settlement between Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies, and Iraq, which were discussed during the last meeting : (l)The friendly neighbouring treaty, which was discussed and settled between the delegates of the two Governments, leaving nothing except entering into it in a legal manner; (2) the question of the forts, in which we agreed to the desire of the British and Iraq Governments, as was mentioned in the letter exchanged between us and our dear brother; (3) the question of plunder of the two States, which we authorised our dear brother Faisal to settle. He should either suggest a solution acceptable to us or suggest its transfer to the tribunal, for which we are ready, on condition that the meeting should not be fixed before the month of Safar. If this is desired, we should be informed of it before the end of Dhul Hijjah; (4) the question of Ibn Mashhur; (5) the Extradition Treaty. The proposals suggested by us in this connexion were handed over to the Iraq delegates by our delegates when they were in Koweit, which were discussed and nearly settled in Jedda when the discus sion took place with the regretted late General Clayton. The most important matter about which the Hejaz and Nejd people are anxious is the question of executing your undertaking which you promised us. We request your Excellency to reply us very early on the questions mentioned above, so as to reach us before we reach the interior of Nejd. As you know, nothing will remove doubts and strengthen relations between the two countries except the execution of your last promise to us. Please reply soon. (Usual ending.) Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

HAND OF BRITAIN. AFFAIRS BETWEEN AN ARAB KING AMP AW AMTB , There is an old frienship between His Ma .lesty the King of Hijaz and Najd and the Amir (Ruler) of Bahrain. This frienship dates from the time when Riyadh, the Capital of Najd was under the rule of A1 Rashid the then Amirs (Rulers) of Hail' a time when 'Abdul 'Aziz bin Sa'ud and his family were frequent ly visiting Kuwait and Bahrain and were the guests of A1 Subah and the A1 Khalifah. When the Gulf Conference which was held between the two Kings was over, His Majesty King 'Abdul 'Aziz mad up his mind to pay a visit to his old friend His Highness Shaikh 'Isa ' bin 'Ali who is now nothing but a prisoner in his Palace after being deposed by British from ruling Bahrain. His Majesty there. 1 fore sent a telegram to His Highness the Shaikh infoming him that he was visiting him on Wednesday morning the 27th Ramadhan (i.e.26.2.30). But British, whose policy necessitates that greai enmity should exist between the Arab Kings and Amirs, and that no friendship and peace should there be between them, did not like that this visit should take place and wanted to put hinder- ance in its way by means of their intrigues, which times have disclosed immediately. The Political Resident sent a telegram to His Majesty King 'Abdul 'Aziz before his arrival to Bahrain saying 'Bahrain is not prepared for Your Majesty ' and at the same time the Consul (Political Agent) in Bahrain went to Shaikh 'Isa and said I have now received a telegram from His Majesty King 'Abdul Aziz to the effect that he gave up the idea of visiting Bahrain and I have come to inform you so that you should not trouble youi -self to make preparations for the visit'. The news, however, werewere soon in circulation and the Bahrain people prepared them selves to receive His Majesty. The Amirs (members of ruling family) and the notables of Bahrain went in steam and sailing boats to meet him at sea and on arrival of the ship which was bringing His Majesty the sea was full of boats and the shore was crowded with the people who made all preparations to receive him When His Majesty heard that the British Consul has informed t Shaikh ^sa that he(Bin Sa^ud) was not landing in Bahrain he sen an urgent telegram saying ' 1 am visiting you just now '• When His Majesty landed in Bahrain there were about 100 cars waiting for him at the Customs pier. The raad leading from the sea to Shaikh 'Isa's palace was crowded with people who called out ' long live His Majesty 11 When the King met Shaikh f Isa the intrigues came out to light and the Shaikh asked His Majesty to remain with him for two days. He (Bin Sa^d) replied ' it is your son (Bin Sa^d refers to himself) who is inviting you to visit your country Hijaz and should you give it the honour of your visit we will ai; then be your guests there'. After remaining three hours in Bahrain he left with hi; party for Uqair.//'&gt;! r THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 'S GOVERNMENT. Anril 4. 1930. EASTE RN (Arabia). .

The Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment has drawn attention in the note of which a copy is enclosed to the satisfactory manner in which the delicate duties entrusted on this occa sion to the Commander of the ' Patrick Stewart ' were discharged by him. Mr. Benn shares the views of the Director-in-Chief, and, subject to the concurrence of Lord Passfield he would propose to cause on expression of appreciation to be conveyed to Captain Marr. 3. A similar letter is being addressed to the Foreign Office. Enclosure to Serial No. (126). Note by Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department. i put up herewith a copy of a report on the movements of the Cable Ship ' Patrick Stewart ' and the arrangements made by Commander J. Marr on the occasion of the conveyance therein of H. M. King Ibn Saud to and from the conference with H. M. King Feisal in February last. In forwarding this report the Director of this Department at Karachi writes :— It is to be noted that this mission was conducted by Capt. Marr, alone and that no Political or other officer was attached. Very consider-* able tact was undoubtedly necessary and I am informed'that the success of the conference was attributed by the High Commissioner for Iraq least in part to King Ibn Saud's pleasure at the excellent arrangements which had been made for him on board the ' Patrick Stewart82 The report shows that Captain Marr, not only had a delicate diplomatic task but met with anxious navigational difficulties and I think he is deserv ing of every praise for the success of his mission. Enclosure 2 to Serial No. (126). Letter feom the Commander , 1. G. T. S. 4i Patrick Stewabtto the Director, Persian Gulf Section, Karachi. I have the honour to report as follows on the occasion of carrying His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Sa'ud on board the u Patrick Stewart On the 30th January 1930, while at Basrah, I was informed by the Hon'ble Political Resident, Persian Gulf, that the ' Patrick Stewart ' would be required on completion of his Trucial Coast Tour to carry King Ibn Saud to the Conference of Kings which was to be held at sea. Ibn Saud wished that the ship should pick him up at a place called Jabal Kawier. This I refused owing to the existence of dangerous shoals and reefs. The alternative ports I suggested were Bahrein or Kuwait. Later the Political Resident asked if I would pick up the party at Ras Tanurah. After due consideration of the navigation risks involved I con sented to go there if I had a free hand and was not tied down to any time. I left Bushire for Bahrein on the 15th February 1930 and arrived there at day light 16th February, 1930. Ibn Saud's Agent Abdul Aziz Algosaibi came on board to make arrangements for the accommodation and feeding of the party. During the 16th and 17th, furniture of all sorts was brought on board, the after deck on both sides being one line of sofas, chairs and carpets. The fore deck had 100 sheep and goats for rations and the rest of the space was reserved for cooking places. The Director's Cabin was refurnished and reserved for His Majesty, the Officers' Mess was turned into a throne room for use of His Majesty and his principal officers. The officers' flat being used as a temporary ship's Mess. The 1st and 2nd Class Cabins were reserved for King Sa'ud's prin cipal Officers. At 15-00 hours on the 18th February 1930, I proceeded from Bahrein towards Ras Tanurah, low water being at 16-00 hours. This would make Fasht-al-Yarim a reef to the Northward of Bahrein 13 miles long just visible and easier to avoid. At 18-05 hours I anchored for the night 28 miles from Bahrein, and was lucky to obtain a good Star position as a departure for an early start the next morning. In this area, which is surrounded by reefs there are no aids to navigation, nor visible land for the purpose of checking position. At 05-30 hours on 19th February, 1930, I proceeded and sighted Ras Tanurah, a low lying sandy point at 07-10 hours, distant 5 miles. Making the place as near low water as possible little or no effect of tide on the course steered was experienced but after anchoring, the tide com menced to run quite strong, at 11-00 hours running past the ship at a rate of 4 Knots, which is contrary to the instructions in the Admiralty Chart and Gulf Pilot. On the 20th February 1930, His Majesty and party boarded from large motor Dhows, a salute of 21 guns being given and the Royal Standard of Nejd being hoisted at the main. The retinue consisted of 110 Nubians armed to the teeth and about 20 omcials. As already 30 men had been embarked at Bahrein, this was considerably in excess of what could be carried with safety. Fuad Hamza the Foreign Adviser, who spoke English well explained the position to His Majesty, who replied that he had promised to take his body guard to the83 &lt; '' 0 '^ r ^ nc ' c : a: ?^ f' 0 * 1 semi them back ; after much discussion without result I wirelessd to ttie Political Resident for instructions.

On the 21st February 1930, during the run towards the Rendezvous His Majesty inspected the ship and took a great interest in everything going everywhere even to the Engine room and boiler room and asked man v questions about the rumung and maintenance of the ship. He informed me that he would probably get a ship for his own use. +i snf 22nd February 1930, at O&amp;'-OO hours I arrived off the mouth of ae Shatt-el-Araband took upthe anchor Stetion 2 Cables astern of . i. o.

During the night it commenced to blow very hard with a very high beam sea and at 02-00 hours in the morn ing I nearly turned back to make the Persian coast until the weather moderated. Luckily it started to lull, so I carried on, Bahrein being the worst port in the Gulf to make, having no lights or aids to navi gation except one light bouy, which is of no use for the reefs which lie twenty odd miles from it, and with over 150 men on board besides my own crew, I was distinctly worried and very relieved to pick up the light buoy at 09-35 hours. On arrival at the outer Buoy there was too much sea to disem bark the party, so I was obliged to proceed and anchor inside the Bahrein Inner Buoy. 10-35 hours. His Majesty's motor Dhows came longside to take off party. 11-00 hours. Sheikh Hamid and large party came off to see Ibn Saud. 12-15 hours. His Majesty and party disembarked. 26tli February 1930.
