Despatch No. 40 (177) Sir, As instructed in the memorandum Pol.11643/1947 enclosed in your express letter of December 9th last, I have the honour to submit a review of the general situation in Pakistan covering the month of January, 1948. 2. • Relations between the two Dominions of India and Pakistan had, by the beginning of the year, deteriorated to a point at which war seemed all but inevitable. The Kashmir imbroglio was but the latest link in a chain of incidents which seemed to the Pakistan Government to reflect a determination on the part of India to prevent any progress in the construction and consolidation of Pakistan, whose separate identity remained a challenge to Hindu ideology and action. An almost identical belief in India that Pakistan was determined to work for the disruption of the new Indian Dominion, though less obviously justified by facts, created an atmosphere of mutual fear and suspicion in which any spark might lead to an explosion, India’a'submission to the United Nations on December 30th, 1947, of her case against Pakistan was made with Pakistan’s willing prior consent, because Pakistan’s own earlier efforts to persuade India to accept the intervention of any third party in the Kashmir dispute had been summarily rejected, and she was happy to obtain a reference to the United Nations, for which she had pleaded in vain in November, even at the cost of appearing before the Security Council in the invidious role of an alleged aggressor. 3. The Pakistan Delegation to Lake Success, headed by Sir Mohammad Zafrullah Khan, Pakistan Minister of Foreign Affairs, was unable to leave for the United States before January 11th, It was followed two days later by Sardar Mohammad Ibrahim, head of the so-called Free Kashmir Government. The proceedings at Lake Success have been adequately reported in the world’s press. Briefly, both parties agreed in principle to the appointment of a U.N.O. Commission of three persons, but the precise functions of this Commission were still not settled at the end of January. The draft resolution submitted to the Security Council by the Pakistan Delegation on January 26th provides for the withdrawal of all non-Kashmiri elements from Kashmir, including the Indian forces as well as the raiders from tribal areas outside Kashmir, and the establishment of an imperial administration to maintain law and order, and to organise a plebiscite on the issue of Kashmir's accession to either*India or Pakistan. The Indian Delegation, on the other -hand, have so far insisted that the Maharajah's accession to India gives her a legal position .in Kashmir which she cannot bo expected to renounce, and limit's the role - of the United Nations representatives to that of observers of a plebiscite to be taken after new elections in Kashmir. Their thesis is that the Indian troops should restore lav/ and order after the withdrawal of all raiders, and that Sheikh Abdullah, who played a prominent part in Kashmir’s accession to India, should remain as head of the administration after a cease fire. 4 . No solution which fails to guarantee a genuinely impartial administration of Kashmir immediately after the cease fire will be effective to secure compliance by the Moslem elements now engaged in fighting there.. Estimates of the numbers of tribal raiders combatant in Kashmir vary considerably, but a fair guess would be that about ten thousand are fighting in Kashmir and another ten or fifteen thousand coming and going behind the lines. These elements, however, are but a fraction of the total forces now battling in Poonch and Jammu, where the Moslem population of the State is under arms. The use of the word 'raiders' in Indian communiques is deliberate and misleading, and it would be necessary for the Indian troops, in order to 'restore order', to repress a popular movement of revolt against a hated and alien regime. Whether they can do so is problematical. P/hat is certain is that neither the Pakistan Government nor Mr. Jinnah personally could persuade these forces to lay down their arms unless it were possible to show them some prospect of impartial administration and a fairly conducted referendum. 5. There Is a tendency in Pakistan to believe that India’s appeal to the United Nations was made under military duress and in order to enable the withdrawal of Indian troops from an impossible military situation without loss of prestige. I doubt whether this is indeed the case. It seems more likely that those res pons ib-le in India are anxious to stop hostilities v/hich cost them vast sums of money and the v/aste of valuable material, but that they consider the performance of / the- 2 - s the Indian troops to have been less discouraging than is here alleged. What may not be realised in India is that the massacres in East Punjab and in Delhi had already provoked the Moslems in the bciife West Frontier to ideas of revenge&gt; and tnat the later killings in Jammu and Poonch, which were the direct ca.*ise of the tribal incursion into Kashmir s probably served to divert from India an anti—Sikh and anti-Hindu Jehad. This determination to be revenged on the Sikhs, and above all, on the State of Patiala, finds common expression among the'tribesmen now in Kashmir; and it is no doubt fear of their resolve to repay the Sikhs in kind that has created in Eastern Punjab and in Delhi a legend that Pakistan is spoiling for war. .6. The latest reports from Lake Success suggest that India may break off discussions there if she does not get her way, and seek a ^unilateral decision** with Pakistan. This desperate course cannot be entirely excluded from calculations. Pandit Nehru is a Kashmir Brahmin, whose emotions are passionately involved in this controversy. Until a United Nations Commission is actually on the spot, it will not be possible to regard the. situation with any complacency, 7. Various developments during January aggravated the tension - already existing between India and Pakistan at the end of 194-7. Hopes raised by the agreement reached in November for a settlement of outstanding financial questions, and the vexed problem of military assets, were dashed by the. decision, of the Government of India to make implementation of this agreement- conditional on the satisfactory issue of the Kashmir dispute. The facts are obscure. The story in Karachi is that the announcement of this intention was made by Sardar Patel in direct Conflict with his Cabinet's wishes, and, indeed, that the consequent f aggravation of tension between Patel and -Pandit Nehru was the main.course of Mr. Gandhi's fast. Be that as it may, India’s refusal to implement the financial agreement was most bitterly resented in Pakistan, and the later reversal of India's decision, duly announced just before the Pakistan Delegation addressed the Security Council, was received here with satisfaction but with no particular gratitude. A minor grievance survived this concession by India, because certain sums claimed by India from Pakistan were deducted from the total credited to her account, although such adjustments would normally follow agreement between the two Audit us-General. Pakistan, for her part, held up delivery of 32 Tempest aircraft and 57 Spitfires belonging to the Government of India, which were lying in ivarachi. These were later released in the atmosphere of goodwill pr xiuced by Gandhi’s fast. Action by the Customs authorities in Bombay to deny cargo to ships clearing for Karachi, which amounted almost to direct economic warfare# was another feature of strained relations; and India's' sudden decontrol of sugar, cotton textiles and food grains, which was decided without reference to Pakistan, proved gravely embarrassing to local economy. 8. The gravest provocations of trouble, however, mercifully produced no tragif echo in India. These were the massacres of non-Moslems .which occurred in Pakistan during January: in Karachi on January 6th and 7th; at Gujrat Pnilway station on January 12th, and at Parachinar in Kurram Agency (North West Frontier Province) on January 22nd. The. awful chain of massacre following previous killings encouraged nu hope that these lamentable examples of communal frenzy would remain unavenged. So seriously did I consider the- risk of violent reaction from the East Punjab to these killings., against the background of steady deterioration of relations and Pandit.Nehru’s threat of direct military action against Azad Kashmir bases in Pakistan, that I advised European British subjects in three districts ■f Lest Punjab to send their wives and families away for a few weeks. Mr. Gandhi's fast intervened, and it is_ probably thanks to him that grave trouble did not occur. I understand that Pandit Nehru, also, used much influence to persuade the press in India to soft-pedal their accounts of those disasters, with a view to minimising the effects of Sardar Patel's unbridled oratory. 9. The' Karachi troubles started with the- arrival in Karachi of a party of 180 Sikhs from Upper Sind, for evacuation by sea to India. According to the local authorities, no notice was given to them of the-arrival of this party, ond it was somewhat provocatively taken at midday through the middle of Karachi in open trucks. The Police behaved badly, and failed to quell disturbances at the start. The Army, which was soon called in, did a very good job; but about 200'persons had been killed and a very great many Hindu shops, etc. looted, before order was restored. The city was put under curfew for ten days. At Gurat Railway station, a train of non-Moslem refugees from Bannu was attacked by Pathan or Afghan tribes men who appear to have been fired on by the train guard when mistakenly attempting to b a r d the train as passengers. Many hundreds were killed, and many hundreds more have not yet been traced. It was Afghan tribesmen, also, who killed 130 /non-MuslimJt / -3- * ) non-Moslems at Parachinar, when taking back to Afghanistan the body of their leader killed in Kashmir. 10. ^In none of these cases can the Pakistan or Provincial Government be considered as accomplice, and. the fforts of those in authority to check the violence in Karachi and to restore confidence were exemplary. But the harm has been^done,^and the already considerable exodus of non-Moslems from Sind and other provinces m Pakistan has received tragic impetus. The emigration of Hindus from Karachi now proceeds at the rate of thousands a day, and hundreds of thousands more are said to be pressing for evacuation from the interior. The consequent dislocation of the- economic life of Karachi is manifestly disastrous. Hitherto the Parsee element has not sncwn signs of flight, but it is rumoured that^they, too, are beginning to feel unable to stay with safety in Sind. The growing numbers and violence of Moslem refugees from India now in Karachi alarm non-Moslems^here, rich and poor alike. Squatting, and the forcible requisitioning of residential property, is one of the most unpleasant features of this situation. 11. The refugee problem as a whole presents, indeed, enormous difficulties to all the Provincial Governments. The West Punjab Government is pressing Sind cJid the North West Frontier Province to relieve the strain by taking some hundreds of thousands of Moslem refugees from the East Punjab, Delhi, etc. The Sind^Government have hitherto resisted this appeal, and at one time, issued orders prohibiting the entry of any refugees by sea. At the end of the month, however, more generous counsels seemed likely to prevail. The traditional tendency to prevent non-Moslems from leaving Pakistan seems also to have given place to a less obstructive attitude, probably because Gujrat and Parachinar have shown the folly of objection. 12. The^latest figures of refugee settlement in West Punjab show 3,200,000 as settled in urban and rural areas out of 5,000,000 refugees entering the Province from East Punjab and the Delhi area. A further 500,000 are in villages awaiting settlement and the rest are, presumably, in camps. These figures differ markedly * from the earlier estimate of 4,900,000 already settled. There is probably much drifting, in an out of the refugee camps. Deaths in the camps are numerous, from cold and disease. 13. Discussions of outstanding questions between Pakistan, and Afghanistan, which had been making little progress for some weeks, were broken off by the Afghan Special Envoy in mid-January. His demand for the recognition of the tribal areas on the Pakistan side of the Durand Line as an autonomous unit was considered tinacceptable, and he resented the Prime Minister’s description of these areas as an integral part of Pakistan. There is risk of tension between the two Governments, aggravated by Afghanistan’s dislike of her tribes' participation in the Kashmir fighting, unless Kabul can be persuaded to exchange diplomatic missions with Pakistan and continue discussions through that channel. 14. The Afghan Prime Minister was Mr. Jinnah’s guest in Karachi from January 9th to 12th. Other distinguished visitors included Mr. Arthur Henderson, on his way to and from the Rangoon Celebrations, and the Prime Minister of Ceylon. H.M.S. ’’Norfolk', flying the flag of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, paid a welcome visit at the beginning of the year. 15. A French Charge de’Affaires has taken up residence in Karachi. The Swiss Minister in London flew out during the month and arranged for an exchange of Legations. A turkish Ambassador has been nominated to Pakistan. 16, The U.K, Delegation to the round-table discussion of sterling-balances and dollars, headed by Sir Jeremy Raisman, arrived on January 6th and left for. New Delhi, after a preliminary tour of the horizon, on January 8th. Pakistan's original refusal to send a delegation to New Delhi, which reflected irritation at India’s failure to implement the financial agreement, was later withdrawn; but there seems to be much doubt as to what the delegation has authority, or ability, to do there. 17. A Food Agreement was negotiated between India and Pakistan, under which India sends wheat, barley and sugar in exchange for rice. This was agreed at Secretariat level, where animosities are notably less bitter, and realities more clearly seen, than in the more turbid atmosphere of political charge and counter-charge. / ' 18. A-4- i ^ 18. A visit to the North ¥/est Frontier Province by the Pakistan Prime Minister seems to have been genuinely successful, and it revealed much goodwill on the part of the tribes towards Pakistan. Visits to East Bengal have been paid by the Ministers of Communications, Food and Commerce. A movement for the decontrol of food-grains in-East Bengal was successfully resisted. 19. The month ended with tragedy. News of Gandhi's murder in Delhi on January 30th was received with terror lest the assassin might be a Moslem. Later reactions varied from grief at the death of one who had come to be considered as the Moslems' best frienc. in India to fear lest the removal of his influence might mean an accretion of strength to Sardar Patel, Deputy Prime Minister of India, who ranks as Pakistan's Enemy No. 1. 20.

KASPIU R. Draft Resolution submitted to Security Council by President was fully reported with ensuing adjournment debate. Eventual decision to adjourn till February 18th and.then resume discussion of other issues tabled by Pakistan was warmly welcomed. There has been no press speculation on reasons for Indian delegation's return and Nehru's disclaimer that India is withdrawing'her case received little notice. General feeling is one of resentment at India's behaviour in mobbing the umpire and of uncertainty regarding future Indian tactics. It is assumed that with apparent failure of Asad Kashmir Howshora offensive and approach of 'spring 9 India regards military situation as less unfavourable. Asad Kashmir counter-communique to Indian report 5 mentioned in para. 3 of 0pdonNo.11, claims defeat of Indian forces of 1,000 with 500 casualties and capture of much equipment. It seems clear, however, hat insurgents failed to gain major objectives and, though lighting doubtless initial offensive was failure, Front!er Premier. , -4 1 - coirGinues, Abdul Qayum, took adv-metage of Karachi visit to make aggressive speech to officers and men of Embarkation Headquarters, saying that all predominantly Muslin areas outside Pakistan would ‘ sooner or later join the Dominion and that claim to Kashmir, based on justice and fair play, would ultimately prevail. BALUCHI STAN. V % Jinna winter cap with front Vs five-day visit from February 11th to Sibi, ital of 'Baluchistail, was given maximum publicity page reports of enthusiastic welcome and colourful ceremonies. Jinuah received delegations of' tribal leaders. local Muslim League, local Labour Federation and other bodies, each of whom presented individual and often conflicting view points, tribal chiefs in particular pressing for maintenance of feudal rights and jirga system, while Muslim League, wanted more democratic constitution. Jinn ah's answer given at Durbar, over which he presided on February 14th, was announce went that am Advisory Council would be set up in Baluchistan to enable himself as Governor-G-eneral to keep special watch over•the.Province. Detailed composition and functions of Council are to be notified later, but it will include representatives of former administered areas, tribal areas, sha h i jirga (Chief Tribal Court) and. Quetta municipality. JinnaVs speech on this occasion was studiously vague about future policy of Baluchistan Government. He did not outline detailed development programme, for which Muslin League has been- agitating, and on question of maintenance of jirga system contented himself with vague injunction to follow 'gold n rules'.of Islam. CohE^There was continuous press speculation throughout visit on position of Kalat, v/ith numerous n inspired” ness ages to effect that accession of Kalat to Pakistan was inv-dnont, Oirmah and Khan of Ealat exchanged formal visits and had long conversations^ but only definite announcement made is that Kal$t #losenhly ? due to meet at end of this month, will decide question of accession. There were no major co::ru:n.al incidents 'during week, • but minor border incidents continued and G.H.Q. Pakistan reported numerous violations of West Punjab/Jammu border by Indian piands and troops. Hopes of getting foot convoys*moving, from West Punjab to Sind (para, p of Opdom. No..11.) have not so far been fulfilled owing chiefly to opposition of refugee leaders, who have succeeded in settling comfortably in West!Punjab and'do not want to move again. Meanwhile, Sind Premier has publicly repudiated any suggestion that Sind had agreed to take more than 100,000 refugees from West Punjab. Speculation regarding, holding of Frontier Assembly Budget Session has increased, and suggestion that Ministry ■may shortly be replaced by 'Section 93' administration is now openly canvassed. It is understood, however, that Jinnah did not agree to this proposal and decreed that Ministry should present their budget to Assembly Gariy next month.

A.^, - .^LmGAL^ INTERNAL. 1, The Pakistan Government have decided to set up a Special Central Police Force to deal with corruption. The Force itself will be established under a special Ordinance, 'which will also enable the Central Government to notify offences, connected with matters concerning either the Central or Provincial Governments, that will fall within the purview of the new Force, This encroachment by the Central Government on the sphere of law and order, which normally falls within Provincial jurisdiction, is to be legalised by a 'Government of India Act Amendment Order', In announcing these decisions, Mr* Faslur Rehman, Pakistan Minister for the Interior, said that though Provincial and Central Government co-operation had already produced good results in combating bribery and corrupt ion, a. Central Force was necessary to co-ordinate their activ ities, and that this new agency was intended to supplement and reinforce the efforts of the ordinary Provincial Police. He emphasised that no-one would be considered above the law and that even a Minister in Pakistan had no claim to special protection* 2* Business in the Sind Provincial Assembly is well up-to-date and there seems no reason to doubt that the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, which meets in the same building, will be able to open as planned on February 23rd. The Pakistan Central Budget is to be presented on February 28th; it will cover all departments of the Pakistan Government, and there will be no separate Railway Budget. li^BOUR, 3. A wave of labour unrest is sweeping Western Pakistan, Agitation by the N.W, Railway Union, referred to in para.3 of Opdom No,12, has continued in Rawalpindi with threats of direct action unless the continued wholesale retrenchment of railway workers is discontinued. The leader there is one Mahommed Ibrahim, variously described as President of the Pakistan Trade Unions Federation - which may be the new Pakistan Branch of the All-India Trades Union Congress - and as President of the North Western Railway T ra des Union. Ibrahim has also been endeavouring to foment unrest amongst workers of the Attock Oil Company, DOMINION AFFAIRS.' Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. 4. In Karachi sudden strikes, in which newly recruited 'refugee' elements appear to have been prominent, are affecting Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie, and the railways, .while the port j stevedores have sent in a 14-day strike notice. The Karachi are said also to be contemplating going on strike, and sent deputations on February 17th to the Sind Premier and Mr. Jinnah. 5* The situation has been aggravated by the Pakistan Government’s belated decision, announced on February 13th, to refer the question of the implementation of the former Govern ment of India Central Pay Commission’s recommendations to a Pakistan Pay Commission. This is to report on the standards /of re-ra Tnfirvo+-! y-if SIKD . I'T.W.F.P. 1 © 2 . of remuneration applicable in Pakistan^ 'bearing in mind the financial resources of the Dominion and the need for achieving rationalisation and uniformity in its services. The preamble to the communique emphasises the vital need for economy, and it is taken for granted that the Indian Pay Commission* s propos als will not be implemented. Strong criticism has already been heard from the Pakistan Railwaymen*s Federation, the P, &amp; T. Lower Grade Staff Union and the Karachi Port Trust Labour Union, and capital is in particular being made from the Muslim League declaration of July 1947 that the existing terms of service would be maintained in the case of employees opting for Pakistan, The Provincial Assembly continued its sittings during the week, the principal business being general discussion of the Budget, followed by the voting of demands for grants and supplementary demands. Business proceeded briskly and auto matically, and though the Opposition, in duty bound, moved token cuts in the demands for grants, these were brusquely disposed of. The only excitement in the Session so far was caused by a private motion moved on February 10th by a Muslim League back-bencher, protesting against the proposal of the Pakistan Government to separate Karachi from Sind, Excited speeches were made from both sides of the House in supoort of this motion, of 17111011 the most violent was one by Mr•M,H.Gasdar, condemning the.move as an attempt by Punjabis to dominate Sind, The galleries, normally deserted, were crowded with enthusiastic visitors who had to be called to order for shouting anti- separation slogans, and a resolution was eventually passed unanimously recordin'', alarm at the proposal to remove the city of Karachi from the control of the Sind administration. The Premier undertook to bring this resolution to the notice of Mr. Jinnah. 7* A Special Committee of the Pakistan Cabinet has'been set up to examine the question of choice of site for the Dominion* s permanent capital: at the sane tine, a Joint Committee, comprising officers of the Central G-overnment and the Sind Government, has been appointed to examine the implic ations arising from any decision to retain Karachi as the permanent capital. Meanwhile, the battle for Karachi continues with an appeal by the Sind Muslin Students* Federation to Branches of the Federation throughout the Province to celebrate February 20th as '‘Karachi Day ff . The Sind Muslin League Council is also reported to have prepared a case against separation, which it is to present to Mr. Jinnah. The two Karachi Hindu doilies were prompt to seize on the proposals for a Central Anti-corruption Police Force, mentioned in para.,1 above, as a further sign that the Pakistan Government were on the lookout for opportunities to encroach on Provincial jurisdiction and undermine Provincial authority; their attitude has since been condemned by '’Dawn' 1 which consistently presents the Central Government case. 8. Crime figures for the year 1947? recently published by the Inspector General of Police, show/' a marked increase in murder and dacoity compared with 1 94^• Murder figures were up by about 3(Jo while dacoities in December, 1947? were nearly double those in Becenber, 1946. The general increase in violent crime, particularly murder, is doubtless to be attributed chiefly to the oconunal disturbances of March, August and Sept ember last; but a further serious complication is the passage of heavily armed tribesmen through the Province on their way to and from Kashmir. These wandering Pathans present an equally difficult problem to the West Punjab District authorities. The Superintendent of Police, Gujrat, recently estimated that he had 20,000 in Ills district alone, and once the objective of Kashmir is removed, the problem of restraining these wandering bands will be a serious one. /STATESSTATES^.

An apologia from this quarter is no doubt welcome to Pakistan, who must be wondering how long ./Arab goodwill towards the new Islamic State can thrive or even subsist on a diet of polite phrases unaccompanied by practical measures. In the meantime, the Muslim 'press continues to ensure that Pakistan’s friendly interest in the Arab cause should not be open to doubt. There-has been much conjecture about tlm proceed ings of the Arab League Council, and the newspaper 'Dawn' has published a report from its London correspondent quoting an assurance by the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in London that Ibn Saud will carry out the Arab League decisions. The sane newspaper, commenting on Arab demonstrations in Spanish Morocco, warns the world that any attempt to frustrate Arab aspirations to complete independence'will be fraught with, grave consequences to inter national. peace. It further develops the familiar theme that the Palestine Partition plan is unworkable and suggests hopefully that wiser counsels may still prevail, particularly in the U.S.A,., where growing apprehensions regarding the effect cn oil supplies of an upheaval in the,Middle East have, it is suggested, consid erably cooled American ardour for partition. The British decision not to permit the Palestine Commission to arrive in Palestine more than two weeks before the termination of the Mandate is approved. 12. The rumour about ex-King Ananullah’ s presence in the K.W.E.P., reported in Opdom No. 12, has been generaly discredited, although the Peshawar correspondent of the 'Civil A Military Gazette' alleges tha.t the news has spread like wild-fire in the Frontier, wrhere it has been believed by the majority. This is not the first occasion on which a rumour of Ananullah’s return has gained currency. 13. The Independence celebrations have been fulljr reported in the local press. Mr. Jinnah’s message of goodwill stressed the bonds between Pakistan and Ceylon, including the fact that /bothU.S.A. TURKEY. GEELiRKY. both had 'suffered from exploitation at the hands of a foreign power'. Sirdar Abdar* Rab Nish tar, Pakistan’s representative at the celebrations, returned to Karachi with glowing accounts of the ho spit alitor and friendliness with which he was received in Ceylon. Indeed, the we 1 cone given to hin was so cordial that he found it necessary to prolong his stay. 14. Hr. Paul H.
