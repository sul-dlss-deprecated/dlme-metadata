SUBJECT: Appointment of an Indian Trade Agent in Aden. Sir , I am directed by the High Canmissioner to inform you that the Government of India has decided to appoint an Indian Trade Agent in Aden for a period of two years in the first instance. The Government of India’s decision arises from their consideration of India’s vital commercial interests in Aden and Dependencies as will be appreciated from examination of the value and range of India’s export and import trade with this territory. H - In addition it is proposed by the Government of India that the Indian Trade Agent, when appointed, should be charged with the function of looking after the general interests of Indian nationals residing in Aden and Dependencies and I am accordingly directed by the High Commissioner to request that His Majesty’s Government may kindly examine these proposals and communicate their concurrence at an early date.

Sir, I am directed by the Hi^i Commissioner to refer to correspondence resting with your letter No.Pol.(Ext)7069/49 dated 2nd June 1949 on the subject of the proposed appointment of an Indian Trade Agent at Aden. I am to inform you that the High Commissioner has sought clarification of the scope of the phrase M Aden and Dependencies” from the Government of India to which reference had been made. Meanwhile, I am to inform you that the Government of India have since decided to re-designate their representative in Aden as 'Assistant Trade Commissioner” instead of Trade Agent, ii. order to maintain uniformity with similar posts elsewhere. There will, however, be no change in duties or functions to be performed by the officer. Yours faithfully, (R.A.L. GONET). for Secretary, External■HHH —. c- G.R. 5. We assume that you would prefer to await the reply to your letter Pol.(Ext) 7069/49 of the 12th of June, before negotiating further with the High Commissioner for India. In the meantime you should know that the Government of Aden observe unat the number of resident and visiting Indians in the Eastern Protectorate is very small at present, and that there seems to be no likelihood of much Indian immigration in future. In the circumstances it would therefore appear immaterial whether or not the Indian representative^ terms of reference included the Eastern Aden Protectorate. They would be prepared to agree to an Indian representative exercising trade functions in relation to the Protectorate if the Gov ernment of India press for it, provided that he is instructed to maintain close touch with the British Agents for the Protectorates, i We would, however, prefer not to have an Indian representative exercising a Commissione r 1 s functions in the Protectorate because it might be difficult to control his activities vis-a-vis the Protectorate Rulers and states Governments. While the difficulties which might arise from activities of an Indian representative would in all probability not be in any way serious, there is always the possibility that the Government of Pakistan might later ask for a similar appointment, which it would then be difficult to refuse if it had already been agreed to in the case of India, and there could be embarrassing repercussions if a Pakistani representative were to have access to the Protectorate Rulers m the exercise of functions wider than those simply conhecTed with trade. We would not however insist on our objection to the appointment of an Indian representative with functions wider than those simply connected with trade to the Protectorate, ifto do so would create any real, -embarrassment vis- a-vis the Government of-IndijWiiJJe^doihowever attach imoortance to the exercise of any sti£h wider powers with proper safeguards, and in this respect we would agree'with the Government of Aden's view that the functions of an Indian representative in the Protectorate should in Aden be exercised through and in close consultation with the British Agents. 6 . I'shall be grateful if you could inform us of the Government of India’s tfiews, on the territoria scone of the Trade Agent *s activities as soon as you are able, and we shall of course be prepared at any time to discuss the proposal to establish an Indian Trade Agent should you feel this to be necessary. $ (j .

We have discussed the question with the Government of Aden and are now in a position to give our views. 2. We have no objection in principle to the appointment of an Indian Trade Agent provided that his functions and duties are confined to trade and commerce. We feel, however, that if he were also to be allowed to look after 'the interests of Indian nationals in Aden', we would concede a wider sphere of activity to an official who is not of consular rank than we do to the Indian Commissioners. We are not clear exactly what would be involved in the term 'Indian nationals', since we gather that this is a constitutional issue in India on which no final decision has yet been taken; but presumably it might in certain circumstances mean that the Trade Agent would be able to concern himself with questions, political as well as general, affecting Indians permanently resident in Aden which are properly the sole concern of the Government of the Colony. 3 . For these reasons neither the Government of Aden nor we can accept the Indian Government^ F. H. CLEOBURY, Esq. , Commonwealth Relations Office. /proposal: - tile posai ai proposalifc stands. 7,e liave therefore considered ing( alternatives:- (a) To agree to a Trade Agent on the understanding that, as is customary, his re spons ibilities would be confined solely ~ ^5 malTters of trade and commerce; or (b) To propose that instead of a Trade ' Agent, the Government of India should appoint a Commissioner on the same terms as the existing Commissioners in other Colonial Territories; or (c) To propose that, in addition to the appointment of a Trade Agent as in (a) above, the Area of responsibility of the Indian Commissioner in Bast Africa should be extended to cover Aden, so as to enable the Government of India to look after the interests of those Indians who are not permanently resident in Aden. 4« The Government of Aden, with whom we are in full agreement, have expressed their preference for the alternative in paragraph 3(a) above. Should this be impossible to achieve the Government of Aden are of the opinion that the proposal in 3 (b) would be the more acceptable alternative. In their opinion, the vesting of consular functions in the Indian Commissioner in East Africa would have the disadvan tage of remote control (taking into account the fact that the position and problems of the Indian community in Aden are appreciably different from those of the Indian Communities in East Africa) and that although it might be argued that they would be less Closely exercised by him than by a locally resident officer, it seems likely that in practice they would be exercised by the local Trade Agent on the Indian Commissioner's behalf. /5.B 2007 B&amp;S 50 nns 3/40 OFFICER OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR INDIA.

We agree that the simplest and most satisfactory procedure to adopt at this stage is to accept the appointment of an Assistant Trade Commissioner to Aden and the Aden Protectorates on the understanding that, as is customary, his responsibilities would be confined solely to matters of trade and commerce. As regards the draft letter to the Indian High Commissioner’s office which you kindly enclosed for our observations, we have three comments to offer (1) The words 'in this respect' might be added after 'whose concern' in the second sentence of paragraph 2 in order to make it clear that we are here referring solely to the question of 'looking after the interests of Indian nationals'. ( 2 ) V/e are somewhat dubious in view of the last sentence of Gonet’s letter of the 8 th July, about the 'assumption' that the Indian Government do not now intend that the functions of their Assistant Trade P.H. CLEOBURY, ES^., COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE /CommissionerJL (3) Commissioner should include 'looking after the interests of Indian nationals in Aden'. We feel that point may he overlooked by the Indian Government and we are anxious that there should be no possibility of any misunderstanding which may cause difficulties and embarrassments at a later stage. In the circumstances, therefore, we should like to suggest a redraft of the last sentence of paragraph 2 on the following lines ' It appears, however, from your letter of the 8 th July that, as now defined, the proposal of the Government of India is to appoint an Assistant Trade Commissioner in order to maintain uniformity with similar posts elsewhere. We assume that it would be correct to conclude from this information that the Trade Commissioner’s responsibilities would, as is customary, be confined solely to matters of trade and commerce. In these circumstances, therefore, it would appear that the difficulty suggested by the. Government of India’s earlier proposal would not arise and that there would be no question of the Trade Commissioner exercising functions more appropriate to an Indian Commissioner'. We should also like to have advance information as to whom the Indian Government propose to appoint to this post in order that Aden may be informed before any announcement is made. Perhaps paragraph 4 might be amended to read:— 'I am to request that the Secretary of State may be informed in due course of the name of the Commissioner whom it is proposed to appoint, in order that the Government of Aden, the Protectorate Rulers and States Governments may be duly consulted bexore an official announcement is made.'
