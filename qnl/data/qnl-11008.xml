The subject is the alleged cession of the Island of Kharg [Iran] from the Persian Government to France in 1836-37, which seemed improbable and, anyway, would have been annulled by the British conquest of the Island, in 1838.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of France, Third Republic</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir 1st Baronet Henry Creswicke Rawlinson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kharg</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000af#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
