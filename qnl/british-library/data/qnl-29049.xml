A; I mentioned to you over the telephone we think it undesirable to make a id/ use for publicity purposes of the ul an ol Uuscat’s portrait, cniefly foi the reason L ivei, in peel's letter to Hushbrook Williams of the 23rd danuary, a copy of wnich 1 enclose for ease of refere^ice. \,e think therefore that it should be withdrawn from the proposed distribution in the Dutch East Indies and hope that ou will be in time to do so. On the other hand we feel that the Sheikh of Bahrein’s portrait ought to be included in any such distribution; the omission might excite unfavourable comment, and there is more justification (e. . in view of the fheikhfe gift to His Majesty’s Government of £50,000) for including it than in the case of the portrait of the Sheikh of Koweit. India Office, Whitehall, S*W.l. © 26th August 1940, As regards distribution in the Middle East generally, I do not think there would be any objection, provided the sultan's portrait is omitted and the Sheikh oi nanrei-i •=&gt; included. But this is more the concern of the Colonial Office (who should be consulted about the juir Abdullah s oortrait) a^d the Foreign Ofiice* I doubt ix it would oe worth the expense to make any distribution in the Persian Qalf, where the attitude of the Sheikhs is well enough known. I should be grateful if you could let me have sometime, for 'domestic consumption', three unfolded copies of the Sultan’s portrait and two of that of the Sheikh of Koweit, and also two of the Sheikh of Bahrein if you should have his portrait printed.

The Sultan is not, perhaps, unmoved by the fact that we only allude to him as “His Highness M , but there is little doubt that Hickinbotham r s estimate of the reasons for his request is the correct one. The recent publicity has been very largely sponsored from this end, but I would be glad if such steps as are possible could be taken to respect the Sultan’s wishes so far as England is concerned. 3. It is not proposed to check publicity from the Indian end, unless the Sultan specifically asks for it, since it has a definite value and is less likely to arouse antagonism in the quarters apprehended by him. I am sending copies of this letter with enclosures to Caroe, and without, to Hickinbotham. R.T.Peel Esquire, C.B*E.,M.C., The India Office, London. RECd. POL.

He referred to an illustration which had recently appeared in the 'Illustrated London Hews* and again mentioned the abuse of Amir Abdullah by the German Wireless. He said he would be glad if steps could be taken to prevent publicity regarding Muscat. I asked him if his object in making this request was to prevent his attitude to the war and Germany becoming generally known. He assured me that he did not object in the least to his attitude being knov/n, after all his friend ship was no new departure it had existed for over tv/o hundred years, but he would rather that a small State like Muscat should be left to play its part and not be forced into the limelight by undesirable publicity. I told him that it was not possible to answer for the press but as far as official statements were concerned I would address the Resident and ask if the B.B.C. could be requested to make as little mention as possible of Muscat and its ruler.'Copy Confidential.

In my opinion the Sultan does not welcome wireless or press publicity because he thinks that should his anti- German attitude be made clear then his province of Dhofar will be liable to attack by such German, or in the future possibly Italian, naval unite as succeeded in eluding the British Navy and he also fears the reaction of the Omanis. They will realise that he has received some form of grati fication and will naturally be irritated if he does not v/el- come the idea of share and share alike. There is also of course the very real danger of extremists making political profit out of the situation and endeavouring to combine the tribes against him by saying that he is endangering their country for Snglish money.
