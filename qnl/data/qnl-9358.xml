The correspondence also discusses the issue of popular movements and administrative councils in Kuwait and Dubai, and the need to assure Ibn Saud that there was no British 'forward policy' in the Gulf.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001df#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
