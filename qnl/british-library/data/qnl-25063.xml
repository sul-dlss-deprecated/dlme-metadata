(bm | ! [May 14] i S: , . . CONFIDENTIAL. Section 6. [23129] No. 1. I'K&amp;v 1A/0 Cf Minute of Sir G. Buchanan s conversation with M. Sazonof on May 14, 1913. IN a conversation which Iliad with M. Sazonof on the eve of my departure on leave, his Excellency said that there were certain considerations which he would like me to lay before Sir E. Grey when I got to London. In the first place, Russia desired more elbow-room and freedom of action in Northern Persia. She had thousands of subjects or protected subjects, the trade was entirely in her hands, and by its geographical position Northern Persia naturally gravitated towards Russia. On the other hand, he was quite ready to allow His Majesty’s Government to do whatever they liked in the British sphere. Russia had not the least desire to annex any part of Persia, nor did she wish to create difficulties for the present Persian Government. On my enquiring what the Russian Government proposed to do if they were given a perfectly free hand, M. Sazonof replied that all that they asked was that His Majesty’s Government should not attempt to exercise a sort of inquisitorial control over their actions. On my repeating to him the views expressed in Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 402 of the 9th May with regard to the disastrous consequences which would result were the recent action of Russian consuls to lead to the resignation of the present Persian Government, his Excellency said that he had reprimanded Prince Dabija for the action which he had taken, in spite of the fact that the Persian Government were not entirely free from blame. They had lately shown a tendency to remove Governors who w^ere persona grata to Russia, and to replace them by men of whom she disapproved. This proceeding he attributed to Ain-ed-Dowleh, who, his Excellency declared, was the one member of the Government who had shown an unfriendly disposition towards Russia. M. Sazonof, however, repeated the assurance which he has more than once given me, that the Russian Government wish to retain the present Government in office and will continue to give it their support. In the second place, he thought that the time had come for us to modify the arrangement arrived at in 1907 with regard to the neutral zone. It had been a mistake on the part of the two Governments to have created a neutral zone of 'such large dimensions, and the mistake was due to the mutual suspicions with which they regarded each other at the time. Now that these suspicions no longer existed, this mistake ought to be rectified. He was not proposing a formal revision of the agreement of 1907, but merely suggesting that the clause relating to the neutral zone should be modified by means of an exchange of notes. In reply to a question of mine, M. Sazonof \ said that he would have no objection to our extending our sphere of influence, which he admitted was very small as compared with the Russian, wffiile Russia would like to obtain certain rights in other parts of the neutral zone. What he did not want was that Great Britain should establish a monopoly for railways in that zone. Touching on international politics, M. Sazonof said that everybody, from the Emperor down to the humblest official in the Imperial Government, deeply appreciated the loyal support which His Majesty’s Government had given Russia during the recent crisis. They were most grateful for it, and it had made an excellent impression throughout Russia. He trusted that the two Governments would always work loyally together on all questions of international policy. There was only one thing which made him nervous, namely, the evident desire of the extreme wing of the Liberal party to bring about a rapprochement with Germany. He quite understood that | Great Britain, like Russia, should desire to cultivate good relations with Germany, but he only trusted that this would not be carried too far. By her attitude during the past f six months Russia had proved how pacific was her policy. She had no intention of [2913 o—6]provoking a war with Germany, but if such a war was forced on her she trusted that she would have England on her side. He knew quite well that His Majesty s Government could not give sucli a pledge beforehand, nor did lie expect it of t em. He was convinced, however, that if Germany was given to understand that m the event of her provoking a war with France and Russia, she would have to face Lngland as well, European peace vrould not be broken. n TXT— —CONVENTION SIGNED ON AUGUST 81, 1907, BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND RUSSIA, » &lt; CONTAINING ARRANGEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF PERSIA, AFGHANISTAN, AND THIBET.

Sir ’ I HAVE to-day authorized your Excellency by telegraph to ^ a with the Russian Government containing Arrangements on the subject o Afghamst^ and Thibet. p ergia ; s limite d to the regions of that country result of British action in those waters for more than a hundred years . His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that this question will not give rise to difficulties between the two Governments should deve opments arise which make further discussion affecting British interests in the Gulf necessary. For the Russian Government have in the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this Arrangement explicitly stated that they do not deny the special interests of Great Britain 'in the Persian Gulf—a statement of which His Majesty s Government have formally taken note. ^ In order to make it quite clear that the present Arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to reaffirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them. His Majesty’s Government will continue to direct all their efforts to the preserva tion of the status quo in the Gulf and the maintenance of British trade; in doing so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of any other Power.

The Governments of Great Britain and Russia having mutually engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and sincerely desiring the preservation of order throughout that country and its peaceful development, as well as the permanent establishment^ of equal advantages for the trade and industry of all other nations ; Considering that each of them has, for geographical and economic reasons, a special interest in the maintenance of peace and order in certain provinces of Persia adjoining, or in the neighbourhood of, the Russian frontier on the one hand, and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Baluchistan on the other hand ; and being desirous of avoiding all cause of conflict between their respective interests in the above-mentioned Provinces of Persia ; Have agreed on the following terms :— I. Great Britain engages not to seek for herself, and not to support in favour of British subjects, or in favour of the subjects of third Powers, any Concessions of a political or commercial nature—such as Concessions for railways, banks, telegraphs, roads, transport, insurance, &amp;c.—beyond a line starting from Kasr-i-Shirin, passing through Isfahan, Yezd, Kakhk, and ending at a point on the Persian frontier at the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers, and not to oppose, directly or indirectly, demands for similar Concessions in this region which are supported by the Russian Government. It is understood that the above-mentioned places are included in the region in which Great Britain engages not to seek the Concessions referred to. II. Russia, on her part, engages not to seek for herself, and not to support in favour of Russian subjects, or in favour of the subjects of third Powers, any Concessions of a political or commercial nature—such as Concessions for railways, banks, telegraphs, roads, transport, insurance, &amp;c.—beyond a line going from the Afghan frontier by way of Gazik, Birjand, Kerman, and ending at Bunder Abbas, and not to oppose, directly or indirectly, demands for similar Concessions m this region which are supported by the British Government.

Russia, on her part, engages not to oppose, without previous arrangement with Great Britain, the grant of any Concessions whatever to British subjects in the regions of Persia situated between the lines mentioned in Articles I and II. Great Britain undertakes a similar engagement as regards the grant of Concessions to Russian subjects in the same regions of Persia. All Concessions existing at present in the regions indicated in Articles I and II are maintained. IV. It is understood that the revenues of all the Persian customs, with the exception of those of Farsistan and of the Persian Gulf, revenues guaranteeing the amortization and the interest of the loans concluded by the Government of the Shah with the “ Banque d’Escompte et des Prets de Perse” up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement, shall be devoted to the same purpose as in the past. It is equally understood that the revenues of the Persian customs of Farsistan and of the Persian Gulf, as well as those of the fisheries on the Persian shore of the O' /Caspian Sea and those of the Posts and the service of the loans concluded by the Government ot tne o Bank of Persia up to the date of the signature of the present Arrangement. Y. In the event of irregularities occurring in the amortization or the payment of the interest of the Persian loans concluded with the ‘‘Bampue ^ ^compte e ^ Prets de Perse ” and with the Imperial Bank of Persia up to the date of the s g at e of the present Arrangement, and in the event of the necessity arising 01 ussia to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of the loans concluded with the first-named bank, and situated m the region mentioned m Article II of the present Arrangement, or for Great Britain to establish control over the sources of revenue guaranteeing the regular service of _the loans concluded with the second-named bank, and situated in the region mentione m ^ 1C e 1 ° p ^ 6 present Arrangement, the British and Russian Governments undertake to enter before hand into a friendly exchange of ideas with a view to determine, m agreement with each other, the measures of control in question and to avoid all interference which would not be in conformity with the principles governing the present Airangement. Convention concerning Afghanistan. The High Contracting Parties, in order to ensure perfect security on their respective frontiers in Central Asia and to maintain in these regions a solid and lasting peace, have concluded the following Convention :— ARTICLE I. His Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they have no intention of changing the political status of Afghanistan. His Britannic Majesty’s Government further engage to exercise their influence in Afghanistan only in a pacific sense, and they will not themselves take, nor encourage Afghanistan to take, any measures threatening Russia. The Russian Government, on their part, declare that they recognize Afghanistan as outside the sphere of Russian influence, and they engage that all their political relations with Afghanistan shall be conducted through the intermediary of His Britannic Majesty’s Government ; they further engage not to send any Agents into Afghanistan. ARTICLE II. The Government of His Britannic Majesty having declared in the Treaty signed at Kabul on the 21st March, 1905, that they recognize the Agreement and the engage ments concluded with the late Ameer Abdur Rahman, and that they have no intention of interfering in the internal government of Afghan territory, Great Britain engages neither to annex nor to occupy in contravention of that Treaty any portion of Afghanistan or to interfere in the internal administration of the country, provided that the Ameer fulfils the engagements already contracted by him towards His Britannic Majesty’s Government under the above-mentioned Treaty. ARTICLE III.

ARTICLE Y. ( J i ie present Arrangements will only come into force when His Britannic Majesty’s Government shall have notified to the Russian Government the consent of the Ameer to the terms stipulated above. Arrangement concerning Thibet. The Governments of Great Britain and Russia recognizing the suzerain rights of China in Ihibet, and considering the fact that Great Britain, by reason of her geographical position, has a special interest in the maintenance of the status quo in the external relations of Thibet, have made the following Arrangement:— ARTICLE 1. The two High Contracting Parties engage to respect the territorial integrity of Ihibet and to abstain from all interference in its internal administration. ARTICLE II. In conformity with the admitted principle of the suzerainty of China over Thibet Great Britain and Russia engage not to enter into negotiations with Thibet except intermediary of the Chinese Government.

It is clearly understood that Buddhists, subjects of Great Britain or of Russia, may enter into direct relations on strictly religious matters with the Dalai Lama and the other representatives of Buddhism in Thibet; the Governments of Great Britain and Russia engage, as far as they are concerned, not to allow those relations to infringe the stipulations of the present Arrangement.

July 29th, 1907 [*S‘ | Mh' tnp-y \ 0 \ I am directthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that he has given the most careful consideration to the views of Mr. Secretary Morley upon the question of the line of delimitation of the Russian Zone in Persia from Kakh to the intersection of the three frontiers in the neighbourhood of Zulficar, as reported in your letter of the 24th instant. I am to remind you that the line defining the proposed British zone in Persia was communicated to the Russian Government after full discussion between the two Secretaries of State and was accepted by them. Sir E. Grey is unable therefore, at this stage of the negotiations, to consent to reopen this question with a view to an extension of the British zone in Persia, inasmuch as it would present an op- he Under Secretary of State, India Office.opportunity to the Russian Government to renew dis cussion on any other point already settled which might he regarded hy them as prejudicial to Russian interests. He will, however, instruct His Majesty's -Ambassador at St. Petersburg to press for a straight line from Kakh to the Intersection of the frontiers as the limit of the Russian zone, but in the event of Sir A.

Draft Russian Agreement, Persia. We understand that Russian proposal that line should run from Kakhk to Khaf, thence to Karez and Kuhibenitak, had been definitely refused. We presume, therefore, that meaning of your telegram is that, if Russian line is brought south to Khaf, they abandon their claim to quarantine post at Karez. On this assumption we would point out that straight line from Kakhk to Zulfikar leaves Bakharz Mountains almost entirely to south of Russian sphere, result which might be useful as protecting our communications along Afghan border. If Russian line is brought south to Khaf, most of Bakharz Mountains will be in Russian sphere, a strategical position will be lost, and their limits will be brought very close to disputed area on Hashtadan frontier, and would be so close to Afghan border as practically to nullify objects of His Majesty’s Government securing straight line to Zulfikar. Russia would also dominate main trade road from Persia to Herat, which would certainly excite Afghan apprehensions. She would also hold telegraph line to Khaf, and might claim a further stretch of this line in neutral zone. For these reasons we strongly deprecate any such concession. If, however, His Majesty’s Government consider further concession inevitable, we would again recom mend that our limit should be amended so as to include Kain and the hills north of it in British sphere. Sykes has since written, strongly urging this on strategical grounds. Indeed, we cannot see any real use in a neutral zone open to commerce of other nations in this part of Persia^vest)of But desert, and we consider such a zone would almost certainly be penetrated by Russians and would serve as constant source of friction. We would, therefore, suggest limit, which may be adopted here as southern limit of Russian zone, should form northern limit of our zone.32 -rj 5 ~~ SUu ^ 3 tZ 2L Ito In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote : 0 . 22645. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. nmeL^ate and ^nfidential.

(No. 106.) 3 q u Sir, A- Foreign Office, June 12, 1907. I HAYE received your despatch No. 69 of the 11th April, in which you express your views on the draft Convention relative to Persia, communicated by M. Isvolsky on the 20th February. You will have observed from the confidential print which has doubtless reached you by now that considerable alterations have already been agreed upon by the British and Russian Governments in its text, and I transmit herewith a counter-draft* which has been prepared by His Majesty’s Government, and which with some possible minor modifications, chiefly of a verbal character, still under consideration, will shortly be communicated to the Russian Government. In order to avoid any misunderstanding as to the interpretation which might be placed upon the Agreement in regard to the position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, I have proposed the insertion in the Preamble of a reference to the special interests of this country in the maintenace of the status quo in those regions. An Article (III) has been agreed upon which will minimize the danger that the preponderating influence of Russia, due to the inclusion of Tehran within her sphere of interest, will be used to prevent the acquisition of British Concessions in the neutral zone ; while Article V, which has also been accepted by the Russian Government, is designed to obviate the possibility of Russia exercising in the British sphere the right to control the customs which is conferred upon her by her loan contracts in the case of default. You will also note that an important modification has been made in the definition of the Russian sphere, the Russian Government having consented to the line terminating at Zulficar, instead of at Kuhsan. It is thus secured that no part of the Russian sphere w T ill be conterminous with the Afghan frontier, a point on the imjDortance of which I need not dwell. You lay stress on the desirability of fully safeguarding British interests in respect of Concessions which have not yet been exploited, and suggest that it should be laid down that not only are existing Concessions to be maintained, but that they may be renewed on their expiry. It has been agreed that all existing Concessions are to be maintained. Should a Concession have remained unexploited, it will become a question for consideration whether the circumstances are such as to warrant His Majesty’s Government in approaching the Persian Government with a view to its prolongation, but I do not consider that any special provision to this end is called for. It is not easy to meet the objection that the renewal of duly exploited Concessions on their termination would be contrary to the spirit of the Agreement, and in view of the expression of opinion evoked from the Russian Government by the proposal to ask for an extension of the Concessions of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, it does not appear possible to insert a provision to this effect. With regard to your further suggestion that some security should be obtained that the telegraph lines now being worked by British enterprise are not redeemed by purchase by the Persian Government in order to be transferred to other hands, I am of opinion that it would not be possible to ask the Russian Government to give such security, which would be worthless, owing to their inability to prevent such a transaction. The question of the extension of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s contracts is at the present moment under discussion, with the Russian Government, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution may be arrived at. You lay stress upon the importance of precluding the Russian Bank from obtaining a monopoly of the importation of silver, but this is not a question which can [2512 m—1] * Printed separately.be dealt with in a Convention, ^^g^^esteblthmente both* in the* BrilSrand ne a uLf woXU a lesjtimate^t of discussion between the two Governments after the conclusion o e ^ ance Q f maintaining in British hands I entirely share your vie y service in Southern Persia, hut this is a question the administration of t e hjut ^ presen t Convention. You are aware that which is necessarily ou si e ^ p su pi ec t of correspondence with the Govern- flip imrvmvpment of the service is now tne suujecb uj. ^ ^ ti- w ± mentTf lnZ and if a diplomatic discussion hecame necess His Ma s£ Government would be in a better position to pursue it with success they were able t0 P T^clausewhich 1 ! h^eproposldas to the maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf will, however it may and I am unable to f a Vindependence of Persia. The words of the definite pledge as to the integrity and mae P e ^ u . , „ nfl the existing enffacmments Preamble are sufficiently clear and precise on this point, and toe existing enga B ements ofthe suhTect however informal may have been their nature originally, are now fm-mSly renewed and fortified by the fact that they are referred to m a Treaty. You Will observe that, in deference to your objections, the wording ol the Preamble has been modified so as to avert the danger which ment will conclude that the British and Bussian Governments aie an o atm to themselves the right of maintaining order or establishing equal advantages for trade iU ^t-ns^weX no question of the two Governments “ acquiring exclusive Concessions in certain provinces,” or of their claiming “ the exclusive privilege of exploiting the assigned provinces,” hut merely of a self-denying ordinance on the part of each Power not to seek Concessions in the sphere of interest of the other, third parties being in no way excluded from seeking for Concessions throughout Persia. As regards your observations as to Russian railway designs I would merely point out that M. Lessar’s projects date from some time hack, and that m any case the “easy alignment towards the Gulf of Oman ™ Kushan and Yezd will be blocked by the interposition of the British zone. ^ ^ -bin The logical conclusion of your despatch is that His Majesty’s Government should continue to pursue the same policy which they have followed m the past of attempting to support Persia against Bussian advances. It is a matter of opinion how far this policy has been successtul hut, in any case, it entails the disadvantage of creating for this country responsibilities which might result in an obligation on our part to come, sooner or later, to the assistance ot jPcicsict Idv force.

His Excellency had the greatest possible doubt as to Russian Government being able to accept insertion in preamble of a passage relative to special interest of Great Britain in maintenance of status quo in Persian Gulf. His Excellency [? observed] that this was introducing at a very late hour a matter which did not concern Great Britain and Russia alone, but also several other Powers, and that it was enlarging the scope of the Agreement beyond limit which we bad both originally laid down, and had up to now scrupulously respected. The Convention, as drawn up, bad dealt with matters concerning Russia and Great Britain alone, and bad raised no points to which other Powers could take exception or which gave them any justification for considering their interests affected. His Excellency himself did not contest our special interests in the Gulf, hut that was not the point. We desired to introduce into a Convention which had for its main object removal of all causes of friction between the two Powers a clause which raised a question A. t in which other Powers might consider they were interested, and he feared that an embarrassing situation might hereafter arise. Proposal had come as a surprise to him, and he hinted if it were of such importance to us we should not have suggested it at the last moment, hut have put it forward before. In short, I could see that he was greatly disturbed at our proposal, which he fears will create difficulties with third Powers. I, of course, argued with him, but did not shake his opinion, and I think that it is probable that the more he reflects upon it the greater will be his objections to it. He objected on somewhat similar grounds to mentioning the question of our control over quarantine in the Persian Gulf, and be is anxious to keep Persian Gulf entirely out of the discussions. He told me he was most anxious to sign the Conventions with as little delay as possible, and that he wished to do so by 15th July (n.s.) He impressed seriously on me that delay was dangerous, and I imagine pressure is being brought to hear against the conclusion of our Agreements. He was very positive as to the risk of delay and distressed at questions now being raised, which would prolong discussions and perhaps imperil the whole arrangement. He said he hoped to be able to give His Majesty’s Government replies on both Persian and Afghan questions in a very few days, and on my suggesting that I might expedite matters by taking them home and discussing them with you, returning here in a fortnight, he begged me not to leave but to stay here and hasten the conclusion. I gather Berlin is causing uneasiness, and I understand oppo sition here is active in certain quarters. I would submit that due weight should be given to his observations, as they were made very seriously. I think we could with success insist on Russian line running straight from Kakh to a point near intersection of Russian and Afghan frontiers, but that we might yield as to complete control of whole of Meshed-Seistan telegraph line and leave out the status quo clause. We should really have gained all that is essential, and, I confess, more than I anticipated, and it seems to me we have a good defence against all criticisms. If I could receive early reply to this telegram it would help to expedite matters. /v n . h ii WmMSir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson (St. Petersburgh).

Sir: - Eoreign Office June 12th.1907 $ ... “9 Under Secretary of state, India Office. With reference to previous correspondence respect ing the proposed Anglo-Russian Agreement relative to Persia I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to trans mit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from His Ma- jesty's Ambassador at St. Petersburg enclosing a com munication from the Russian Government respecting cer- ^ ^ tain further amendments which they desire to introduce into the Preamble and Articles I to IV. I am to observe that the point numbered 1 in the enclosed aide-memoire had already occurred to Sir E. Sir A. Nicolson on the 6th. instant copy of which is Grey and that in the counter-draft which was sent to KflgMT v*.. q a ^ enclosed for convenience of reference, the wording of C* . A ■ ■ tion that Great Britain and Russia would appear to be the preamble has been altered so as to meet the objec- arrogating to themselves the right to maintain order inPersia. Sir E. Grey is of opinion with regard to (2) that / it would not be desirable to omit the words relating ' to the establishment of equal advantages for tne trade and industry of all nations. Ihe omission in ques tion would expose the agreement to the charge of being designed with the object of reserving certain portions of Persia for exclusive exploitation by Great Britain and Russia and would not fail to excite hostile criti cism not only in Persia but in all countries, other than the Contracting Parties and especially in Germany, which have commercial relations with Persia. The Russian objection to the words is partly based on the argument that they do not altogether conform to the terms of the Convention. By this is no doubt meant that a desire to establish equal opportunities of trade for all nations is not consistent with the provi sions of Articles 1 and 2 which specifically exclude Great Britain and Russia from seeking such opportuni ties in the sphere of the other. This objection could be met by subsuituoing the words ’’all other nations” forfor 'all nations' and Sir E. Grey would propose to put forward this suggestion to the Russian Government. With regard to (3) Sir E. Grey sees no objection to the omission of the allusion to the injurious effect of friction between the two Powers. As regards (4) Sir E. Grey considers that the rea sons explained in Sir E. Grey’s despatches which ren dered undesirable the termination of the Russian line at Kuhsan would equally apply to the line being drawn, as now suggested by the Russian Government, within a few miles of the Afghan frontier. There would however appear to be no objection to inform the Russian Govern ment that if they consider it indispensable to maintain a sanitary station at Karez. His Majesty's Government will raise no objection to their doing so provided that the Russian Government on their part take no steps to interfere with the existing arrangement whereby the quarantine system on the Persian Gulf is under British control. Sir E. Grey is disposed to accept the alterations suggested under (5) and (6). There /There is no objection to the remaining amendments ' proposed which are of a verbal nature and which, so far as they have not been anticipated in the enclosed draft agreement, may be accepted by His Majesty's Gov- ■ eminent.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govemmpnt. i I HAVE received your Excellency’s despatch No. 277 of the 23rd ultimo, forwarding copy of a private letter from the Russian Minister for Eoreign Affairs, in Government. I now transmit to your Excellency herewith a revised draft Convention, embodying certain modifications which, after further consideration, His Majesty’s Government would desire to see introduced into that Agreement. of the Shah, and that such an expression cannot fail to produce an unfortunate effect on the minds of the Persian Government and people. Although, as your Excellency is well aware, the two Governments have, in fact, in the Persian Gulf. This clause has been added in view of the strong and explicit declarations of my predecessor on this subject, which is evidently one of paramount importance to Great Britain. It is felt that the omission from the present Agreement of any mention of this point would make a had impression on public opinion in this country, and seriously affect the popularity of the Agreement when concluded. His Majesty’s Government therefore press for the insertion of these words in the preamble, in order to secure that the Agreement, when announced in this country, should be accepted from the first by both parties with goodwill. In Article I the words “ At a point on the Persian frontier adjoining the inter section of the Russian and Afghan frontiers ” have been substituted for the words “ on the Afghan frontier near Zulfikar.” This change has been introduced at the suggestion of the India Office, who have pointed out that Zulfikar is well within the territory of Afghanistan. The substituted wording has the further advantage of emphasizing the fact that the end of the line defining the Russian sphere lies in Persia, and not in Afghanistan. Articles II, III, and IV of the Russian draft are retained unaltered. The draft Article put forward by the Russian Government in place of the British Article V is accepted, with the addition, at the end, of the following clause:— “ And to avoid all interference in the respective spheres which would not he in conformity with the principles governing the present Convention.” These words have been inserted in order specifically to exclude all possibility of the exercise by Russia of her right of control over such of the sources of revenue affected to the service of the Russian loans in Persia as lie within the British sphere in the event of irregularity occurring in the service of those loans, as foreseen in the Article.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 13.) (No. 69.) Sir, Tehran, April 11, 1907. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt on the 7th instant of copy of a draft Convention relative to Persia, communicated by M. Isvolsky on the 20th Eebruary. It is clear from the date and manner of the communication that my opinion on this proposed Arrangement is neither invited nor desired. At the same time it appears to he my duty, as laid down in the King’s General Instructions, to advise you as to the probable effects of such an Agreement upon British interests in the country in which I reside and where the Agreement is operative. X assume that the amendments desired by you are carried into effect and that Russia is debarred from eventually exercising control over the coast-line outside the Gulf and the frontier adjacent to Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and also that British Concessions lying within the Russian sphere are maintained. Some of these Concessions, as the D’Arcy Oil Concession, the Khanikin telegraph-line, and the Sultanabad-Dizful road, are not yet exploited, either wholly or in part. I presume that British interests in this respect will be fully safeguarded, and that it will be clearly laid down that not only are existing Concessions to he maintained, and to he held entitled to the fullest diplomatic support, but that they can he r enewed if so desired. This point is of importance, in view of the fact thaTwhTINthe Concession of the Telegraph Company has been renewed to 1915 the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s Concession expires in 1925, and should he renewed like that of the Company for another twenty years. It would also he of importance to receive some security that the telegraph-lines now being worked by British enterprise are not ) edeemed by purchase by the Persian Government in order to he transferred to other hands. Another point which vitally interests British enterprise is that the Russian Bank should he precluded from acquiring the monopoly of the import of silver for coinage purposes which they demanded some years ago, and which would render nugatory the note monopoly enjoyed by the Imperial Bank. The right at present held by Great Britain of administering the quarantine service in South Persia is of great importance, as if allowed to fall into other hands it would probably be exercised to the detriment of British trade. In view of the hostile attitude of Russia and her Belgian agents towards the British quarantine service, it would be a wise precaution to secure her formal adhesion to a continuance of the present Arrangement. With regard to the effect on popular opinion here of the publication of such an Agreement as the present Convention, there cannot I think he any reasonable doubt. It will simply be regarded as a Treaty for the partition of Persia. It will he observed that there is no formal and definite pledge as to the integrity and independence of Persia, hut merely a reference in the preamble to the existing engagements, which are, as is known, of an informal nature. It was hoped that any Agreement between Russia and England would contain a formal engagement to maintain these principles, and the resulting disappointment will he considerable. It will also be observed that the two Governments are animated by the desire “ to maintain order throughout Persia, and to establish equal advantages for trade; ” that they recognize u their mutual interests in maintaining peace and order in certain provinces; ” and that each pledges itself not to seek Concessions within a certain zone which is reserved for the other. It will be concluded from these expressions that the two Governments arrogate to themselves the right of maintaining order in the Shah’s dominions, and also of acquiring exclusive Concessions in certain provinces, which become a sort of special preserve. In view of the strong current of public opinion which now prevails, and which is hostile to any foreign Concession, or any species of foreign control, the publication of [2474 n —2] X Cfj/^ A 4L fCnn) lA-f Uvm h- / I/LA (Ails ■ ;2 an Agreement of such a nature as this, and couched in such terms, cannot fail t0 produce a very strong impression. Any foreign country, not directly concerned in the Ansdo-Itussian Agre went, would undoubtedly be able to reap considerable advantage from the odium which would certainly accrue to the Contiaciing Parties; and they should be prepared for such an eventuality. It will be uiged by those hostile to the influence of Russia and England here, of whom there are many, that the two Empires have agreed together to connive at the acquisition of the widest possible rights, &lt;c Concessions of whatever nature, political or commercial, by England or Russia in by far the largest and richest part of the Peisian Empiie, mutually abandoning to one another the exclusive privilege of exploiting the assigned provinces. I consider it my duty to point out to you what, indeed, is evident, and has already been repeatedly brought to your notice, that public opinion in Persia will be deeply stirred by what will be regarded as a partition of the Empire, and a claim to exercise control over the sovereign rights of the State, and that a great impetus will at once be given to the already existing anti-foreign sentiment, which has hitherto been kept in control, though with constantly increasing difficulty; and I also beg to add that there is reason to fear that this feeling will be all the more bitter against England in proportion to the hopes which have been centred in her, and the belief in her friendly sentiments and sympathy, which have so long prevailed, especially among the popular classes, who have looked to the Liberal Government of England to protect them against the encroachments of Russian autocracy. With regard to the practical value and effect of the Agreement if concluded, I do not believe it will either accelerate or retard the advance of Russia in this country. It is interesting, however, as giving an indication to what are Russia’s designs, namely, to construct a line towards Herat by the route surveyed by M. Lessar on the left bank of the Heri Rud to Kuhsan, to commence the line along the easy alignment towards the Gulf of Omen already surveyed, via Kashan and Yezd, and to construct the connecting line betwmen the Caucasian system and the Bagdad Railway, vi^ Tabreez, Hamadan, and Khanikin, which is no doubt already agreed on with Germany. By the time these lines are finished the position of Russia will he so strong that even if the Convention has still some time to run, it will be a case for the application of Count Lamsdorfffs doctrine that “ when circumstances are no longer the same, former Agreements cannot be considered as binding.” It will, however, be a matter of some difficulty for Russia to carry out this programme under her own authority. To judge by present appearances, the Persian Government will resolutely refuse to grant any Concessions whatever to foreigners. The Assembly will attempt to develop the resources of the country by assigning Concessions to native Companies, which no doubt will seek foreign help, but will naturally be averse to applying directly either to Russia or Great Britain. But the alignment to be followed by railways or roads will probably be decided by the Power which possesses the control over the seat of the Government. There is no doubt which Power it is. Russia has given us a seat on the saddle, but she sits in front and holds the bridle. You emphasize this point of view when you express the desire to neutralize the seat of Government. But I venture to point out that this can only be attempted by a series of provisions forbidding Russia to advance money to the Government, or increase her guards, or organize the army under Russian officers, or resort to the innumerable means of influence, direct and indirect, of which she at present disposes. And I venture to add that, even if Russia consented to the insertion of such provisions in the Convention, they would be useless. Nothing could be more abundant and precise than the series of self-denying provisions of this nature contained in the Corean Agreements betwmen Japan and Russia of 1896 and 1898. But these did not prevent the Prussian officials on the spot from resorting to naval demonstrations, acquiring control of the Corean Government by flattery and menace, from attacking the Japanese bank-note monopoly, or from attempting to obtain possession of strategical positions and of the control of the coinage, mining rights, and general financial administration of the country. I venture to express the opinion that no pledge of this character would be of mUC ri? no ^ing will prevent Russia from obtaining complete control over the Persian Government except the resistance of Persia herself, and her own re uc ance to overcome that resistance by force. It appears evident that the Persian people will resist, nor will their resistance be diminished by the fact that England W1 . , b 6 -n ? iave abandoned their cause. But we cannot expect that their resis ance 1 be in the interests of Great Britain; and we cannot hope to obtain a veiy avourable hearing to our own demands. I cannot but regard the situation of OBritish interests in North Persia, and indeed over the whole Empire, as likely to he precarious after the conclusion of the Agreement; and I trust'that their owners will be warned to look for protection not to Tehran but to^St. Petersburgh. Although in a sense the Convention only recognizes what already exists, and what we cannot prevent, namely, the immense preponderance of Russit in Northern Persia and in the capital, its publication will, I think, produce a considerable effect on the general situation. It will imply the definite withdrawal of England from the diplomatic struggle at Tehran on which the Persians have so long relied as the safe guard of their independence. And. it will no doubt cause a feeling of fear and indignation, which will very probably take the form of an appeal to other countries for assistance. It is not probable that assistance will be granted in any practical form. The only hope for Persian independence lies not in foreign help, or Treaties or Conventions, but in the Persian people themselves, and in their newly-acquired sense of dignity and patriotism, and perhaps in the solidarity of all Mussulmans. His Majesty’s Government can hardly desire to place themselves in public opposition to such a sentiment. But from what I hear I have good reason to believe that the Agreement between England and Russia wall he classed with that between England and Prance as an anti-Mussulman combine, and that an appeal will be made to Mahommedan feeling all over the world. I venture therefore to suggest that, simultaneously with the publication of the Agreement, such explanations will be publicly made as will show clearly what is the real object of the Agreement, and that it was never intended in any way to lead to the partition of the Persian Empire, or the spoliation and enslavement of the Persian people. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE.:&gt; =ri -- Copy* PEE AMBLE.

The draft of an Article III proposed hy Sir A. Nicolson is intended to give effect to the view of His Majesty's Government on this question. Sir E.Grey considers it satisfactory in principle, hut would pre fer to substitute the words 'same regions ,, for the words 'afore-mentioned regions of Persia' at the end of the first paragraph which would, in his opinion, improve the language of the Article without altering its sense. He\oV : lol \JI He would accordingly propose, subject to the con currence of Mr. Secretary Morley, to authorise Sir A. Nicolson to submit this draft to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs with the slight verbal alteration above indicated. Sir E.Grey concurs in Sir A. Nicolson’s view that it would be well to omit from the text of the proposed Agreement any specific reference to 'zones 1 ' or 'spheres'. Sir E.Grey is of opinion that Sir A. Nicolson's proposed draft of an Article V represents, in principle the views of His Majesty's Government on the point with which it deals. He would prefer, however, to omit from it any mention of the possible establishment of controllers of the one nationality over customs or pledged revenues in the sphere of the other Power, a contingency for which no specific provision is made - in the loan agreements concluded by the Imperial Bank 1 of Persia with the Persian Government. He would further suggest that the idea embodied in the Article would be more precisely expressed if the following wordingwording were substituted for that submitted by Sir A. Nicolson:- 'In case of the non-payment of the interest on loans contracted by the Government of the Shah in Russia, Great Britain would be prepared to undertake the collection and remission to the Russian Government of the due proportion of the customs receipts or other revenues pledged to the service of such loans in the regions within the lines mentioned in Article 11 . 'In similar circumstances, Russia would be pre pared to undertake the collection and remission to His Britannic Majesty’s Government of the due proportion of the customs receipts or other revenues pledged to the service of the loans, contracted by the Govern ment of the Shah with the Imperial Bank of Persia, in the region within the lines mentioned in Article 1'. Sir E.Grey proposes, if Mr. Morley should see no objection, to authorise Sir A. Nicolson to submit to Monsieur Izvolski the draft of an Article in these termsehc fee t; Sir, vAPR 2 1907] I notice that in the Bitasian 'Draft non vent ion regar ding Persia, besides specifying the nature of the conces sions which each Power should abstain frcn seeking in the zcno of the other, the Husolan Oovornnent have stated that w ••Great Britain on her part engages not to seek for her own Puss!a account, or cn behalf of hr S ti an subjects, o r in f-ivcur o f Russian 8ubjoct ; s of third Powers any concessions ctc. a The werdo underlined are an interpolation which, erhaps, you r.ay have Wished to seo retained.

Petersburgh i February 20, 1907. 1 ’ M ISYOLSKY handed me to-day a draft Convention in regard to the future mutual relations between Great Britain and Russia, which had been drawn up by the Russian Government, of which I have the honour to transmit a copy. I did not peruse it in his presence, and accepted it without comment. I regret that I made a confusion in telegraphing yesterday between Kuhsan and Kuchan, but the misunder- standina* was due°to mv not catching accurately the pronunciation of the names of the two places. The preamble is ,identical with that of the British draft Convention, except that the word ‘‘ collision ” is used in the last sentence instead of word “ interference.” As to Article II, I have, since dispatching my telegraphic summary of the Russian draft Convention, examined the draft which I communicated to M. Isvolsky, and I find that the definition of hhe British line is practically identical in both documents. The observation which I made in my telegram, in regard to the words “ par les fronti&amp;res de TAfghanistan et du Beloudjistan,” was therefore made without due consideration. The final paragraph will, I presume, require some amplification and amendment. I do not know whether you would consider it necessary to specify in the Conven tion that the revenues of the Caspian Sea fisheries and the posts and telegraphs form securities for the British loans, but in any case it would, I submit, be right to state clearly that the customs revenues of the Ears and of the Persian Gulf are secured for the service of the British advances. As the paragraph stands there is no mention of British loans at all. I do not know whether in the Convention you would consider it desirable to mention that Mohammerah is included in the Persian Gulf ports, or to leave this debateable point alone. We could not be considered as having abandoned our views by preserving the phrase “ Ears and the Persian Gulf.” There is no mention, as from my conversation with M. Isvolsky on the 18th instant I had been led to expect, of the maintenance of the existing Concessions in our respective zones. The omission to mention them, dmd as the Articles^deal with the future, leads me to think that the Russian Government imply that such Concessions do continue to exist. M. Isvolsky.apparently wishes to arrange the question of the two telegraph lines separately from the Convention. You may consider that there is no objection to such procedure. If, on the other hand, we desired that all Russian Bank agencies in Seistan, for instance, be withdrawn, the Russian Government might request that we should abandon Concessions in the Russian zoqe, and this might raise the question of the Indo-European and Indian Government telegraph lines, Imperial Bank, &amp;c. It might be wiser, perhaps, to leave the question of Existing Concessions alone, and restrict ourselves to finding outside the Convention a solution of the Meshed—Tehran and Meshed-Nasratabad lines. I submit this view with all diffidence. When both Governments have come to an agreement as to the Convention, I do not think there wuuld be great difficulty in arranging as to the above-mentioned telegraph lines.. I should be grateful if you would kindly supply me with the final paragraph amended in the sense desired by His Majesty’s Government, so that I may communicate it to M. Isvolsky. I have, &amp;c.

In continuation of my telegram of 28tli .Felnuary. Russian negotiations. Text of Russian proposals regarding Persia forwarded to you with letter, dated 8th March, from Political Secretary, India Office. Following is translation of exact words of Russian definition of their line: Line starting from Kazri Chirin, passing through (traversant) Yezd and “ Kakhk, and terminating on the Afghan frontier near the town of “ Kuhsan.” This does not appear to justify apprehensions stated in your I telegram of 6th March, hut point will he cleared up if necessary. Question of including Rain in British sphere cannot be raised at present stage. His Majesty’s Government have instructed Nicolson to ask for following modifications of Russian proposals :— (1.) Termination of Russian line at Zulficar instead of Kuhsan. (2.) That, inasmuch as Russia has the advantage of inclusion of Tehran in Russian sphere, Russia should agree not to oppose concessions in neutral zone, if engagement is reciprocal and limited to British and Russian concessions. (3.) That clause be inserted providing for maintenance of all existing concessions. (4.) That while we do not object to transfer of Meshed-Tehran and Meshed-Seistan telegraph lines being effected by exchange of notes outside convention, the notes should he signed simultaneously with convention, and should be indispensable condition of signature of latter. (5.) Insertion of clause providing that revenues affected to British loans shall, as hitherto, be devoted to service of those loans. (6.) Nicolson authorised to announce to Russian Government that, should contingency contemplated by loan contracts arise, we are ready to collect and remit to them due proportion of customs revenues affected to Russian loans which are in British sphere of influence, provided that Russian Government agree to reciprocal arrangement in their sphere.COXEIDKNTIAX. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson (St. Petersburgh). (No. 30.) Foreign Office, March 8, 1907, 5’35 r,M. YOUR despatch No. 101 : Persian Convention. Preamble of draft proposed by Russian Government is satisfactory, and may be accepted. Article I.—As to Russian line, we note that Preamble speaks of British and Russian spheres of influence as “ contiguous with or in proximity to Russian frontier on the one hand, and frontiers of Afghanistan and Baluchistan on the other,” and that no mention is made of Russian sphere being contiguous with Afghan frontier. Further, as we are responsible for the external relations of Afghanistan and are obliged, not only by Treaty with the Ameer, but also by Article VI of the Persian Treaty of 4th March, 1857, to undertake the settlement of all frontier and other questions arising between Persia and Afghanistan ; the introduction of another Power having special interests on the Perso-Afghan frontier would tend to complicate matters and defeat the very object of this Convention. It is therefore most important that no part of that frontier should lie within the Russian sphere. We would have included the whole frontier within our own sphere if we had contemplated the possibility of the Russian Government putting forward their present claim, but we wished to make our sphere as small as possible. You should therefore ask that Russian line should terminate at Zulfikar, on northernmost extremity of Afghan frontier. There can he no question of yielding on this point. We had originally intended to demand that town of Tehran, as the capital and seat of foreign Legations, should form a neutral enclave in the Russian sphere. We are now, however, prepared to make a most important concession by waiving this point, on the understanding that, in consideration of the greatly increased influence which may accrue to Russia by the inclusion of the town in her sphere, she will under take not to oppose, without previous agreement with us, the grant to British subjects as to those of third Powers of concessions in the neutral zone. It would be manifestly unfair that increased prestige at Tehran should be used on the spot there to our detriment in the neutral zone, which is governed, like the rest ol; Persia, from Tehran. Article II.—We consider that a clause should be inserted providing for the maintenance of all existing concessions. We have no objection to effecting the transfer of the two telegraph lines by an exchange of notes outside the Convention, provided that it is distinctly understood that the notes arranging for the transfer should be signed at the same time as the Convention itself, and that this is an indispensable condition of the signature of the Convention. We have no intention of demanding the removal of the agencies of the Russian bank in Seistan, which would entail that of the agencies of the Bank of Persia in the Russian sphere, and would cost us more than we should gain by it. The last paragraph of the Russian text appears to us incomplete, and we siiggest the following addition :— “ It is equally understood that the revenues of the Persian customs of Farsistan and the Persian Gulf, as well as those of the Caspian fisheries and of the posts and telegraphs, shall be devoted, as in the past, to the service of the loans concluded by the Government and the Shah with the Imperial Bank of Persia. There remains the question of providing for the eventuality of Russians being placed as controllers of customs in Seistan in consequence of the non-payment of the coupon of the Russian loan. We consider that so long as it can be shown that the revenues of the Customs are devoted to the service of those loans (as stated in the last 1128 — 191]paragraph, of the Russian draft) it does not matter to the Russians by whom they are •collected. You are therefore authorized to announce to the Russian Government 'that in the event of the necessity arising, as foreseen by their loan contracts, we are readv to undertake the collection and remission to them of the due proportion of the customs revenues in our sphere of influence which may be affected to the Russian loans if the Russian Government will agree to a similar arrangement regarding revenues pledged .to British loans within the Russian sphere.I2&gt; Sir A.

Negotiations with Russia. Your telegram of the 28th February. As regards lines proposed for sphere of concessions in Persia, are t\ e to understand that these will be drawn on map as indicated, or that limits of provinces will be followed ? If latter, we would point out that limits of Ispahan and Yazd would carry Russia far to south, and if she can claim Bakhtiaris as dependency of Ispahan her sphere would descend to Ram Hormuz, which is perilously close to ports on Karun and at head of Gulf. Probably this is not intended, as, if it is, it would he unnecessary to have two lines north of joint boundary of Yazd and Kerman. At the same time we venture to suggest that it might be well to have this point made quite clear. It will be awkward to exclude Kain from British sphere, and we should prefer, if possible, that line should be drawn in desert north of Kain, which would exclude all Russian influence from Kainat. We trust measures may he taken to ensure that our influence in Arabistan may not be ousted in favour of Foreign Power with interests opposed both to Russia and Britain. Present discussion about Karun irrigation concession perhaps gives us oppor tunity of strengthening our influence there. As National Bank will now obtain its charter, which gives Bank exclusive right to concessions, possibly it might be easier to secure this concession for Sheikh than for foreign syndicate.X 7 ' V r-— !

Slr ’ iirrrpTT , , Foreign Office, February 28, 1907. WITH reference to my letter of the 12th December, 1906, I am directed by becretaiy oir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh,* forwarding, with observations, a draft Convention to regulate the relations of Great Britain and Russia in Persia,]- which was handed to his Excellency on the 20th instant bv the Russian Minister for Foreimi Affairs. The preamble of this draft Convention is identical with that of the draft prepared in this Department, which was communicated to the India Office on the 12th December, 1906^ (see Confidential Print, Persia, the 17th November, section 1), with the exception that in the^ last sentence the present instrument substitutes the word “collision” for the word “interference.” This preamble may therefore, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, be accepted by His Majesty’s Government as satisfactory. By Article I of the Russian draft, the line defining the proposed Russian sphere of influence in Persia is drawn from Kasr-i-Shirin, through Yezd and Kakhk, to a point on the Afghan frontier near Kuhsan. It is to be observed that, though this line would not bring Russian influence, from a geographical point of view, nearer to Herat than it at present extends, it would give the Russians access to the valley of the Heri Rud, which is clearly an easier way of reaching that place than any route at present open to them. Sir E. Grey considers, therefore, that it should be pointed out to the Russian Government that, in the proposed preamble which M. Isvolsky has accepted, the provinces which are to constitute respectively the British and Russian spheres of influence are spoken of as “ contiguous with, or in proximity to, the Russian frontier on the one hand, and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Beluchistan on the other,” and that no mention is made therein of any contiguity of the Russian sphere to the Afghan frontier. The Russian Government should further be reminded that, since Great Britain is responsible for the external relations of Afghanistan, His Majesty’s Govern ment are obliged to undertake the settlement of all frontier and other questions arising between that country and Persia, and that the introduction of another Power having special interests on the Perso-Afghan frontier would tend to complicate the situation, and ivould thus defeat the very object of the present Convention. The Russian Government should therefore be asked to make the line bounding the Russian sphere of influence terminate, not at Kushan, but at Zulfikar, the northernmost extremity of the Perso-Afghan frontier. It seems also desirable to demand that the town of Tehran, as the seat of the Government and the residence of the foreign Legations, should be regarded as a neutral enclave, and thus excluded from the Russian sphere of influence. (With regard to Article II, Sir E. Grey has no observations to offer, but he considers that, in order to avoid any possible ambiguity in the future, a clause should be inserted in the Convention by which all existing Conventions would be maintained. The transfer of the Meshed-Seistan telegraph line to British, and that of the Meshed- lehran line to Russian control, might, he thinks, be effected separately, as desired by M. Isvolsky, by an exchange of notes, but the note or notes by which these transfers are arranged should be signed simultaneously with the Convention, and the Russian Government should be made clearly to understand the procedure which it is proposed to adopt.

The last paragraph of the Russian draft is clearly incomplete from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, since it omits to safeguard the revenues devoted to the service of the British loans in Persia, and Sir E. Grey would suggest the following addition:— “ II est egalement entendu que les revenus des douanes Persanes du Farsistan et du Golfe Persique, ainsi que les revenus des pecheries Caspiennes et des Postes et Telegraphes seront affectes, comme par le passe, an service des emprunts conclus par le Gouvernement du Schah avec la Banque Imperiale de Perse.” There remains the question whether any provision should he made in xhe Convention for the eventuality of Russians being placed as Controllers of Customs in Seistan in the case of the coupon of the Russian loans not being paid. The concluding paragraph of the Russian draft states that the revenues of the customs, with the exception of those of Ears and the Persian Gulf, will continue to be devoted to the service of the Russian loans, and it may well be argued that, so long as it can be shown that they are, in fact, devoted to that purpose, it is a matter of indifference to the Russians by whom they are collected. The eventuality con templated, though unlikely to be realized in the immediate future, is yet a possible one, and I am to suggest that it might be well to announce to the Russian Government that, in the event of the necessity arising, Great Britain will be ready to undertake the collection and remission to them of the due proportion of the customs revenues in the British sphere of influence which, under the existing contracts, may be affected to the service of the Russian loans.

The observation which I made in my telegram in regard to the words w par les frontieres de 1 Af ghanistan et Beloudjist.an' was, therefore, made without due consideration. The final paragraph will, I presume, require some amplification and amendment. I do not know whether you would consider it necessary to specify in the Convention that the revenues of the Caspian Sea Fisheries and the posts and telegraphs form securi ties for the British loans, hut in any case it would, I submit, be right to state clearly that the Customs revenues of Pars and of the Persian Gulf are secured for the services of British advances. As the paragraph stands there is no mention of British loans at all. I do not know whether in the Con vention you v/ould consider it desirable to mention that Mohamerah is included in the Persian Gulf ports}- or to leave this debatable point alone. V/e could not be ** Ithe the phrase 'Fare end the Persian Gulf'. f There is no mention, as from my conversation with Monsieur levoleky on the 18th instant I had been led to expect, of the maintenance of the ex isting concessions in our respective zones. The omission to mention them, and as the articles deal with the future, leads me to think that the Russian Government imply that such concessions do continue to exist. Monsieur Isvoleky apparently wishes to arrange the question of the two telegraph lines separately from the Convention. You may consider that there is no objection to such procedure. If, on the other hand, we desired that all Russian Bank Agencies in Seistanc, for instance, he withdrawn, the Russian Government might request that we should abandon concessions in the Russian zone, and this might raise the question of the Indo-European and Indian Government telegraph lines. Imperial Bank, &amp;c. It might be wiser perhaps to leave the ques tion of existing concessions alone, and restrict ourselves to finding outside the Convention a solution of the Meshed-Tehran and Meehed-Nasratabad ii lines.1 , &gt;45 ^ c [This Docmnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Governmei',.] PERSIA.

Draft Agreement. THE Governments of Great Britain and Russia, being mutually pledged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and animated by a sincere desire for the maintenance of good order and pacific development throughout the Persian Empire, as well as for the establishment of equal opportunities for the commerce and industry of all nations, have resolved that a Convention be concluded between them in the following terms:— The Governments of Great Britain and Russia mutually recognize that each has, for geographical and economic reasons, special interest in peace and order being maintained within certain provinces of Persia contiguous with, or in proximity to, the Russian frontier on the one hand, and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Beluchistan on the other; and each of the two Governments, being impressed with the detrimental effects of local friction on their relations with Persia and with one another, is anxious to avoid all ground for interference with the special interests of each in the Persian provinces to which reference has been made above. It is therefore hereby agreed as follows :— 1. Great Britain engages not to seek or maintain for her own account, or on behalf of British subjects, any concessions of a political or commercial nature within a line and not to obstruct, directly or indirectly, applications for such concessions in that region supported by the Russian Government. 2. Russia, on her part, engages not to seek or maintain for her own account, or on behalf of Russian subjects, any concessions of a political or commercial nature within a line passing from the Afghan frontier through Gazik, Birjand, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas and the frontiers of Afghanistan and Beluchistan, and not to obstruct, directlj^oi indirectly, applications for such concessions in that region supported by the British Government.

Russia engages not to oppose directly or indirectly Concessions supported by British Government in British zone, and Great Britain undertakes a similar engage ment as to Russian zone. No mention is made of [? maintenance ofj existing Concessions, as was stated verbally to me yesterday, but Russian Government may consider this as implied. Final paragraph states that revenues of all the Persian customs, with the exception of those of Farzistan and of Persian Gulf, guaranteeing the service of the Russian loans are to be devoted to same purpose as heretofore. Minister for Foreign Affairs stated to me yesterday that the above reserved revenues were affected to British Joans, but I presume you will wish that all the revenues affected should be clearly specified in the Convention.

His Excellency told me that he thought that our draft Convention as to Thibet could be accepted, but he questioned me as to scientific Missions and as to Chumbi occupation. I told him that I was expecting a draft note as to the former, and that I had submitted a draft Declaration as to the latter, but had not yet received a reply.

I said that only settlement to my mind was a t ran sf cr. It will be best to await proposals in writing, so that I may be sure that I have correctly given line, and that I may see all the details, as he only read me passages. _ He informed me that he had succeeded in winning over military party to accepting in principle our zone—which was practically abandoning Seistan to us, and was a surrender of what might in certain eventualities be an important strategical position. He said further that Persian question could not be settled until we had come to an arrangement as to Afghanistan, and asked me to give him a sketch of our views. _ 1 expressed my inability to do so at present, but hoped to be in a position shortly to give him some proposals. I asked what Russian views were. He said that military party , was anxious lest we should change Afghanistan from a buffer State into a country I entirely under our control, and obtain Ameer’s permission to organize Ms troops, bin a railways, &amp;c. I said we could not prevent the Ameer from developing ins country and ' building railways if he wished to do so. . I asked if he meant that Russia desired the maintenance of political status quo.

Sir C.

Lsvolsky yesterday afternoon, and stated to him that now that he had returned to St. Petersburg!! I trusted that our negotiations would proceed with reasonable despatch. I told his Excellency that the details of an immediate advance of money to the Persian Government were practically settled, and that we were now at liberty to deal with the wider question of our future relations in Persia. During his absence from St. Petersburgh, I had been in communication with you on the subject and that you were of opinion that progress should be made in the discussions. It seemed to me that there w ? ere no serious obstacles in the way of a fairly speedy settlement, and, indeed, owing to certain indiscretions which had given the public press occasion to comment on our negotiations, it was desirable that we should come to terms with as little delay as possible. M. Isvolsky replied, that he need not repeat to me that he was sincerely desirous of arriving at a final arrangement, but that he must be allowed time to overcome the opposition which existed in certain quarters, not perhaps so much against the principle of a friendly understanding with Great Britain, as against the basis on which we proposed to found an Agreement. He was personally quite in accord with our views (“je suis parfaitement dans votre ordre d’idees ”), but the proposal to delimit spher es of influence was by several important authorities regarded with much hesitation and doubt. For instance, the General Staff, with whom he had not yet discussed the matter seriously,, w ere, he gathered, indisposed to abandon Seistan absolutely to our influence and control. To the military mind those districts were of great strategical importance, and might in the future be of great value. He w ould then have to be armed with strong arguments to overcome their opposition and to remove their objections, and he would have to be able to prove to the military authorities that compensatory advantages would be acquired elsewhere. Then, again, there was a great mass of public opinion to be converted and be brought over to the new direction which Avould be given to Russian foreign policy. In view r of these considerations, it was evident that some time must elapse before we could approach the end of our negotiations. I told M. Isvolsky that the military mind only saw r one side of the question, and that opposition to an arrangement from military quarters w'as to be expected, perhaps not exclusively in Russia. He should not imagine that there was a consensus of opinion among all the authorities who had been consulted on our side ; but the responsible directors of the negotiations did not give undue weight to the military point of view. I intend to go into this portion of the question more fully on another occasion, as I wished yesterday to lead the conversation on to other grounds. In connection with the military point of view, I would beg leave to call your attention to the enclosed letter from Colonel Napier, whom I had desired to sound the Chief of the General Staff on the subject of an Anglo-Russian understanding. I further told M. Isvolsky that, so far as I was able to ascertain, public opinion in Russia w^as, generally speaking, in favour of an arrangement with Great Britain, and journals so wide apart in politics as the c£ Novoe Vreyma ” and the ‘ e Oko ” were singing pseans in praise of an Agreement. His Excellency said that it was possible that a portion of the press were well disposed, but he cited one or twm papers who were opposed to an abandonment ^of the secular policy of Russia. There was, he added, another point which somewhat perplexed him. He presumed that our Convention, when signed, would be published, and he w r as puzzled how r a preamble would be composed which would satisfy the Persian Govern ment and other countries that w'e were not proceeding to a division of Persia and were not departing from the principle of the “ open door/' I observed to M. Isvolsky that I did not consider that .the drafting of a suitable [2216 77?.—6] A.-nreamble would be a matter ot great difficulty We could place at the beginning a nhraw testifying our mutual desire to maintain the integrity and independence of Persia and we cSuld then proceed to mention that., in view ot our respective geographical frontiers marching with RlL^honld ^ek'wmalntein 0 inflimnceb |°e dMcts wl kh trde^d on the frontier of the other. We could d.chm ,h districts ill the course of our negotiations. We had, indeed, already specified the ■ d St cts which we considered essential to the security of our frontiers and I understood from him that what I might term the Russian district would he m the north of Persia. The two districts would! I trusted, not he contiguous, but that there would bean intervening space between them. To my mind, that was a most desirable condition. We could then obtain from the Persian Government an engagement not to allow either district to be disturbed by admitting another Power to interests m it. *o Power con® possibly take exception to such an arrangement, as our lights to secure om frontiers from disturbances or interference were incontestable. It would, I said, re well not to mention “spheres of influence or interest,” I had not, I added, a teadj-crawn formula to submit to him. but what I mentioned was the general outline, and I knew that it was in accordance with your views. r t it , r* M Isvolskv remarked that, as we wished to exclude the grant of concessions to other Powers in our districts, some of the latter— Germany, for instance—might contend that we were not upholding the principle of the tc open door.” T replied that I could not agree with that view. It was quite true that we should not admit that other Powers should seek for concessions in our district, and he anew well that concessions for railways and other enterprises in coimtues such as Persia carried more with them than appeared on the surface. But I did not think that it was desired to shut the door to legitimate commerce, and, in any case, throughout the whole of the rest of Persia the door would be sufficiently wide open to any concessions and trade which other Powers might wish to promote. He had mentioned Germany; was I to understand that that Power had raised any objections to our arriving at an understanding between ourselves ? . M. Isvolsky said that he had carefully abstained from allowing Germany to have any insight into the nature of our negotiations, as he consideied that these were matters which concerned us alone. Although Germany had shown no disposition to place spokes in our wheel (“ de mettre des batons dans nos roues it was evident that she had no interest in seeing us arrive at an understanding ( cc elle n avait pas d interet de nous voir arriver a une entente 3 ’). I would naturally recollect what had occurred in the matter of the Anglo- French Agreement in respect of Morocco, and the difficulties in which M. Helcasse had been placed by not having previously or opportunely acquainted the German Government with what had been arranged. Moreover, I had not made it clear to him how t he Persian Government would he induced to view with complacency the arrangement which TT^fTshetched. Supposing they were to regard it as a partition, in a disguised form, of tHeircountry, and were to turn to Germany to intervene in the matter ? I was not to suppose from these observations that he was raising unnecessarily imaginary difficulties to an arrangement. He was wholly and sincerely in favour of our coming to an under standing, but he wished to lay before me the different aspects of the case, especially as it would present itself to other parties, and to show me that the question was not one which could be solved easily or speedily. I did not think it prudent at our first meeting after his return to go more fully into the attitude and views of Germany, as he may still be under the influence of his recent visit to Berlin, and disinclined to be probed on the matter. I will obtain another opportunity before this messenger leaves of questioning him more closely on the subject, and I did not desire to give him the impression that 1 was either anxious or distrustful as to what had passed at his interview at the German capital. Before leaving the question of Persia, I put to him the direct question as to whether the Emperor was still in favour of an understanding with Great Britain, M. Isyolsky replied that undoubtedly His Majesty, was still of the same mind ; but that when the question, for instance, of a delimitation of our respective spheres m Persia came before His Majesty, he would naturally consult with his military advisers as well as with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. isvolsky added that he wished to be in such a position on that occasion as to be able to show His Majesty that the weight of argument did not lie on the side of the military. The impressions which my conversation with M. Isvolsky left on my mind are that, though personally desirous of coming to an arrangement, he is disposed to proceed with extreme and deliberate caution, and to make such slow progress as would unduly prolongthe negotiations and permit the introduction of elements which might be of a disturbing character. It will, I think, be necessary to stimulate M. Isvolsky to proceed more rapidly, and I would suggest that it would be of advantage if I could be furnished with the draft of an Article which would serve as a preamble to our Agreement in regard to Persia, and which would be drawn on the lines which I hastily sketched to M. Isvolsky. I think that if he were placed in possession of such a draft, some of his hesitations would be removed, and he would see that our proposals were not so difficult to frame as he at present appears to imagine. We could in this Article, or Articles, lay down our mutual desire not to disturb the political status of Persia, and also specify the districts in which, in view of the propinquity to the Afghan and Belooch frontiers, we are anxious to maintain peace and order, and in which we could not admit the interference of other Powers. We should be obliged to leave in blank the districts in which Russia has a similar interest, but this lacuna would afford a good reason for urging the Russian Government to supply the omissions. I also believe that M. Isvolsky, had he this document in hand, would be in a better position to discuss matters with the Emperor and with his colleagues. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. Inclosure in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Napier to Sir A. Nicolson. (Confidential.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, November 3, 1906. I HAY E the honour to report that, in accordance your Excellency’s desire that I should endeavour to ascertain what are the views of the military party on the question of an Agreement about Persia, I took the opportunity yesterday, when paying fmy respects to General Palitzin on my return to duty after a prolonged absence, of sounding him on the subject. General Palitzin, Chief of the General Staff, is at present, with the exception of the Grand Duke Nicolas, the most influential officer at head-quarters. He received me with great cordiality, and conversed on a variety of topics, so that 1 was able to introduce the subject of Persia without raising any suspicion of that being the special object of my visit. General Palitzin expressed himself, I believe sincerely, in favour of friendship with England, and declared that all through Asia we had a great many interests in common, but that the mutual distrust and misunderstandings which had lasted so long could not be put aside in a moment, and made an Agreement very difficult. As regards Persia, he did not believe in, and was opposed to, spheres of influence. iQjiig opinion, it was not a practical policy. The trade of Persia was a matter of real importance, and it was impossible to set limits to its operations, which were governed by the laws of supply and demand, geographical considerations, means of transport, &amp;c., which enabled one or other country to push its trade in various directions at the expense of its rivals. Of course it was possible to divide up Persia ; but if Russia and England each took spheres of influence, Germany and other countries would also demand their share, and then we should have to conquer Persia. General Palitzin did not look with favour on the prospect of the Bagdad Railway with a branch to Kbanikin, but thought the prospect was remote, and meanwhile he was not an advocate for prolonging the Russian railway from Erivan towards Tehran. He avoided giving any strategical reasons for his objection to spheres of influence, and I could not press him on that point without putting forward the actual proposals of our Government and betraying my purpose, which your Excellency wished me to avoid. I have, &amp;e. (Signed) H. D. NAPIER, Lieutenant-Colonel, Military Attache'.[This Document is the P rop erty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] [Bj PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. ' [36283] Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received October 29.) (No. 264.) Tehran, October 11, 1906. IT is, of course, too early for me to give any opinion on the general situation. I venture, however, to submit the following observations:— Whatever he the immediate practical effect of the new popular institution, there appears to be little doubt that it is the outward sign of a considerable change through which Persia is passing. From all I hear I gather that the spirit of patriotism has come to life and may be come to stay. This is the natural result of the educational work of the Babis, the Pan-Islamic movement, and the feeling of personal dignity which has been revived in the Asiatic mind by the successes of Japan. Whatever may be the strength and practical value of the movement, I venture to submit that it should not be lost sight of. From this point of view it would appear that in any negotiations with regard to this country which we carry on with Russia we should put on record, as the first and principal point of our policy, our traditional desire to obtain, in a definite and final shape, the formal recognition of the principle of Persian integrity and independence, and the maintenance throughout Persia of equal opportunity for the commerce of all nations. I submit that our hands would be greatly strengthened in dealing with this Government should we be able to point to indisputable evidence that this was our first and foremost demand in negotiating with Russia for the final settlement of our differences. Should we desire to effect a settlement of those differences by a mutual agreement to restrict our d ip lom atic activities to certain respective portions of the Persian Empire, I submit that such an agreement should be of a specific and definite character, relative to the prosecution under English and Russian influence respectively of certain industrial enterprises, the definition of the measures against the infiltration of plague, and other details of a commercial or administrative character, but that all proposals liable to be misinterpreted as a demand for exclusive territorial control should be sedulously avoided. I fear that an English proposal of a territorial character would be a valuable instrument in the hands of any one anxious to prove to the Persian people that the policy of Great Britain, which has so long and so ably striven to maintain the principle of Persian integrity and independence, had now changed, and that we were striving to buy off the hostility of Russia by surrendering to her exclusive control over The greater part of Persia, on condition that we were permitted to hold as our exclusive possession that small remaining portion which we considered necessary for the defence of our Indian possessions.

Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 29.) (No. 694. Confidential.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, October 15, 1906. THE French Minister, M. Boutiron, inquired of me the day before yesterday whether my discussions with M. Isvolsky were making any progress. I told him, in confidence, that the two Governments would shortly make a small advance in common to relieve the most pressing necessities of the Persian Government, and that M. Isvolsky and myself were still engaged in discussing the broad outlines of a future agreement. I did not go into any details with M. Bontiron, nor give him any indication of the points which were at present under treatment, but 1 said that I anticipated that later on the military party would place considerable difficulties in the way of a satisfactory arrangement. I added that I was sure that M. Isvolsky woidd do his best to overcome any such difficulties, but that I was unaware whether his influence and position were sufficiently strong to enable him to meet with success. In any case, I expected that the negotiations would be protracted. M. Boutiron remarked that he had some doubts as to whether the present occupants of the Russian and French Legations at Tehran would facilitate the negotiations. The French Minister should, in his opinion, naturally play a secondary part at Tehran, and confine himself to a benevolent and conciliatory interest in the rapprochement between the two countries, but he feared that M. Descos, who was an ambitious and active man, might be disinclined to assume so modest a part. I said that I had known M. Descos in Morocco, when he was Secretary of Legation, and that at that period, which was prior to the Anglo-French Agreement, he had led an active campaign against England during a lengthy sojourn he had made at Fez. This attitude on the part of M. Descos was, however, quite natural, and no exception could be taken to it, and I presumed he would receive instructions to follow a different course in present circumstances. M. Boutiron went on to say that M. Hartwig had been imbued with the old traditions prevalent at the Ministry here, and that his views on the Persian question were probably divergent from those held by his Chief, and that possibly with his greater knowledge of the details of the questions, he might exercise an influence on M. Isvolsky which would hamper a smooth course of the negotiations. He asked me if I had observed any “ German tendencies ” on the part of M. Isvolsky. I replied that hitherto I had not, but it would be foolish to imagine that Germany would view with complete satisfaction the conclusion of a durable understanding between England and Russia. M. Boutiron said that, before returning to St. Petersburgh, M. Isvolsky would pay a visit to Paris, where he would see the President and M. Bourgeois, and that he would naturally make a halt at Berlin, where probably he would have an audience of the Emperor, to whom he was a persona gratissima, and also see Prince Biilow. I remarked that it would be of interest to observe what impression these visits would leave on the mind of M. Isvolsky when he returned here. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON.

I understood that both His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government had given assurances in the sense desired to the Persian Government, and I thought that there the matter might be allowed to rest. At the present stage of our negotiations it was, to my mind, undesirable to draw public attention to them, but I should be glad to hear his views on the question. M. Goubastoff said that he agreed with me that as little publicity as possible should be given to our negotiations, though, if the Persian Government desired to reassure the public, they might be permitted to make the statement in the manner they considered to be the most appropriate.

In the event of tlie Russian Grovernment raising the question of an agreement relating to Persia on Sir A. Nicolson’s arrival in St. Petersburg, it would be advisable that lie should lay down as a general basis, before ^ entering upon any discussion, that His Majesty’s Government attach the highest importance in any negotiations that take place upon the recognition of the independence and integrity of Persia, and, with a view to securing tranquillity upon her frontiers, the recognition of the province of Seistan and the provinces coter minous with the British frontier in Baluchistan as entirely within the British sphere of influence and outside^ the zone of future Russian railway enterprise. The only indication which His Majesty’s Go vernment have of recent years received from the Russian Government of their views as to a settle ment of the Persian question has been their desire for a commercial outlet in the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government would present no objection to the realisation of such a project, provided there was no question of the construction of the terminus of a future Russian railway at Bunder Abbas or at any point to the eastward. A commercial outlet for Russian trade in the Persian Gulf may possibly be found by the participation of Russia in the Bagdad Railway. Subject to these considerations His Majesty’s Government would he ready to discuss any pro posals put forward by the Russian Government, whether based on the joint co-operation of the two countries for the development and amelioration of Persia, or on the division of spheres of influence by a line drawn vertically, horizontally, or diago nally from north-east to south-west, or any other scheme that the Russian Government might prefer to suggest. S. S.- ^ ^ r No. 27 of 1904. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. Frontier. To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Tort William, the 4th February 1904. Sir, In the telegram of your predecessor, dated 3rd September 1903, the opinion of the Government of India was asked upon the question of the action to be taken for the defence of British interests in Persia in the event of Russian encroachment or occupation in the north. This question which had originated in certain correspondence between Sir A. Hardinge, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and the Marquess of Lansdowne in 1902, had been discussed by the India Office, the Intelligence Department of the War Office, and the Admiralty in England, and had subsequently been referred to an Inter- Departmental Conference, at which representatives of all these Departments, as also of the Foreign Office, assisted. The Report of the Conference, held on the 19th November 1902, and the papers and memoranda which had been placed before it, were subsequently transmitted to India by Lord George Hamilton : and the consideration of the matter was only deferred by us until His Excellency the Viceroy had had an opportunity of discussing the matter in person with Sir A. Hardinge during his recent visit to the Persian Gulf. His Excellency having returned and placed us in possession of the results of this discussion, we are now in a position to forward to you the opinion for which we have been asked. 2. There are several remarks in the papers submitted to us with which w r e do not find ourselves in agreement, and which we only mention here because the acceptance or rejection of the views which they express, affects to a large extent the conclusions at which it is possible to arrive. We do not at all agree that, if Great Britain found it necessary under any conditions to occupy a port or ports in the Persian Gulf, Germany, France, and Turkey would necessarily or naturally do the same. The situation in the Persian Gulf bears little or no resemblance to that in the Gulf of Pechili: and there is not the same provocation to international rivalry that there was in the latter quarter. We are not aware of any authoritative ground for the belief that, if Great Britain in the defence of her interests were to occupy ports or territory in Southern or Eastern Persia, and were thereby to come into conflict with Russia, France would necessarily join the latter, and confront us with a Franco-Russian military combination. We differ from the views that have been expressed in some quarters upon the construction of the Baghdad Railway as a flank defence to the position of Great Britain in Southern Persia and the Gulf, and we deprecate the idea that our political and strategical interests in those regions can only be adequately protected by an understanding with Germany. In our view the interests of Germany in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf are more likely to be antagonistic than favourable to our own: and we see no sufficient ground* forthinking that there is any international combination to which we should look as a buttress to our interests or influence in that quarter. These views are expressed independently of the question, which has never been referred to us for opinion, of the ultimate completion of the German Asia Minor Railway to the Gulf; for we presume that it is an accepted principle with His Majesty’s Government that, should the line ever he continued south of Baghdad, this cannot he done without British co-operation and consent; and that no terminal port can he selected, unless a similar consent has been obtained, and unless the port is made open and international in character : further, if these views are also entertained by His Majesty’s Government, we ^ think that nothing hut good could result from Germany being made acquainted with them, lest, when her railway reaches Baghdad, she might complain of having been kept in ignorance of British policy and intentions. 3. The other alternative, namely, that of an agreement with Russia about the Persian Gulf, is one that we view with still less sympathy. Such an agree ment could only he purchased at the sacrifice of advantages, now in our sole and undisputed possession, the importance of which is perhaps not as fully recognized as it deserves to be. As will be seen later on, we favour the fullest and most explicit statement to Russia of our views and intentions; but we do not at present see either the materials for a compromise or the necessity for an understanding. The situation would, no doubt, be altered, if the Russian Government were to acquiesce in the statement of British policy that was made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his conversation with the Russian Ambassador on 25th November last, as reported to us in your telegram of 3rd December. But we are at present without information as to the likelihood of any such result. 4. There is another respect in which the views that we have been invited to discuss seem to us to be coloured by apprehensions in excess of the probabilities of the case. The situation that has been contemplated by certain of the writers of the memoranda in question is one in which the whole of Southern Persia, within a line drawn from Seistan on the east to Kermanshah on the w 7 est, would be occupied, or attempted to be occupied, by British troops, while these would be confronted at a slight distance by the armed forces of Russia, in similar occupation of the north of the country, and threatening the British posi tion, either at once or in the future, with hostile advance. Viewed from this standpoint, stress has been laid upon the risks of a position in which at least 50,000 and perhaps 100,000 British soldiers would be required to hold a long and in places indefensible frontier, and in which they would be faced by an enemy, possessing almost inexhaustible resources of men and uninterrupted land communication with his base. Even the tribes which are regarded as turbulent, when there is a question of their being controlled by Great Britain, become, in pursuit of this hypothesis, the useful instruments of Russia’s designs. In our opinion this picture bears little relation to the probable facts. We do not contemplate as even remotely likely any position in which Great Britain would occupy and hold the whole or the greater part of the south of Persia, while Russia did the same in the north. Still less do we foresee a situation in which an inadequate force of British troops would be confronted, or compelled to retire, by a vastly superior Russian army, pouring in from the Caucasus, the Caspian, and Khorasan. We think that perhaps insufficient atten tion has been paid to the extreme unlikelihood that Persia will become either the sole or the main theatre of war between Russia and Great Britain. The former has many other frontiers to guard and many other fields of conflict upon which her forces would in all probability be engaged. We see no reason for suppos ing that she would be able to concentrate the great bulk of her forces in Persia, or to undertake the sustained and overwhelming advance to the south that seems to have been contemplated in some of these papers. 5. The first necessity accordingly in our opinion is to correlate the problem submitted to us both with the general tendency of Russian policy in Asia and with the facts of the Persian situation. In our view the Asiatic history of Russia during the past half century lends no support to the theory that she desires to conquer or annex Persia, to subvert the Persian monarchy, or destroy the Kajar house. On the contrary, her policy everywhere, at Constantinople, atmflBtiM Tehran, at Khiva and Bokhara, at Lhasa, at Peking, and at Soul, is to maintain the existing authority and to support the reigning sovereign, hut to reduce him to a state of vassalage to herself. The control of Central Asia from the Caspian to the China Seas already places a tremendous strain both upon her military and financial resources : and she has, as we read her intentions, no ambition for the present to annex more territory or to subjugate more peoples by force of arms. She greatly prefers to control the government of the countries, which she desires to influence, through the prevailing form of government or dynasty, and to utilise them as the instruments through whom she may obtain supreme political influence and unchallenged commercial control. Whafc she has success fully done in the Central Asian Khanates she would like to do in Persia (and doubtless also in Afghanistan). Por these purposes it is necessary that the unit with which she is dealing for the time being should be so weak as to he dependent, but not so weak as to fall absolutely to pieces. The screen of the Native Government must be kept intact, so as to cover what might other wise have the appearance of hostile designs; and the appearance of the Russian forces must be stripped as far as possible of any appearance of aggression and be associated with the restoration of order or the support of indigenous institutions. It is notorious that in Persia the Russian representatives have been somewhat alarmed at the unduly rapid pace at which the Persian monarchy has in recent times been advancing on the road towards ruin, and that the last thing which they desire is to precipitate a crisis, which would demand armed intervention in that country, or bring about the downfall of the Persian monarchy. 6. We think that these political considerations should be kept prominently in mind in forming an opinion upon the strategical problem referred to us*: and that no solution of the latter that is arrived at in independence of them will possess much value. In the light of these general considerations we will now proceed to discuss what would be the probable course of events in case of any serious rupture of the status quo in Persia. 7. It appears to us that there are two contingencies which ought to be contemplated. The first of these is the advance of Russian forces across the Persian frontier, on some such pretext as has been suggested, and the occupa tion of a single point or objective, w T hich might be either Tabriz, Meshed, or Tehran. Of these places Tabriz owing to the close vicinity of Russian territory, which is about to be connected by railway with the Persian border at Julfa, is the most likely scene of action. Meshed, which is scarcely less accessible and equally vulnerable, may be placed second. The occupation of Tehran would, hardly be undertaken as an independent operation, but would be part of a movement that had other ramifications. The second contingency that we should keep in view is that of a sustained and simultaneous Russian invasion of the whole of Northern Persia, in which not merely would the three cities that have been named be occupied, but Russian forces w r ould overrun the provinces of Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazanderan, and Khorasan. The question is what should be done by Great Britain upon the occurrence of one or other of these emergencies. 8. From what has been said it is clear that in our opinion the probabilities of the first or smaller programme immeasurably exceed those of the second. We should never be surprised at a Russian threat to occupy either Tabriz or Meshed. In fact, there is reason to believe that the threat has already been made in the former case. Neither should we be surprised in either case at its execution. There would not be the smallest military risk in either operation ; and the only ground that would permanently induce Russia to desist from the undertaking would be the certainty that any such step would provoke a retaliatory movement on our part, which would jeopardise the success of the wider policy which we have credited her with holding in view. 9. If Russia were to make any one of the forward movements, culminating in the occupation of Persian territory, that we have described, we think that Great Britain should at once retaliate by a corresponding movement along the frontiers accessible to her forces by land or sea. This movement would not be in the nature of a hostile advance, or an invasion of the country, or a permanent occupation of foreign soil. We should enter Persia because we claim an absolute equality of interest in that country with Russia, \^&gt;o r *9 I\ 4 and with a view, hy discussion, to re-estahhsh the eqmhhrmm winch hy her initial action she would have violently disturbed. We should enter as the supporters of the dynasty, in order to ensure a return to the stalm quo vntr and to save those parts of the country lying nearest to our borders or m which our interests are paramount, from the risks of disorder that could hardly fail to be aroused by the news of an undisputed occupation by a foreign Power, and that would equally affect the security^of Persian interests and our own. Above all, though this may sound paradoxical, we should^ enter m order to accelerate, under proper conditions, evacuation by the Russians as well as our- selves The places at which such actions are open to ns are, bioadly speaking, four in number,—namely, Seistan, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Mohammerah. Of these an advance upon Seistan, or the occupation of Bunder Abbas and the adiacent islands, or the two in combination, would undoubtedly produce the greatest impression upon Russia, since if persisted in they would cut across the lines of her Asiatic policy and would imperil the attainment of her ultimate ends. The occupation of Mohammerah would probably _ produce a greater moral effect upon the Persians from its greater proximity to the capital more especially if it were accompanied or followed by the threat of a movement upon Isfahan. On the whole, as it would be more important at such a iuncture to induence Russia than to frighten Persia, we should recommend the first in preference to the second plan of action. If Russia were to advance upon Tabriz or Meshed (or «upon Tehran), we would at once push forward a force to Seistan, and we would move the fleet to Bunder Abbas. The occupation of that port and of the adjacent islands is merely a question of runnin 0, up a flag, which would be eagerly welcomed by the inhabitants, who are °not Persians, hut Arabs. The general principle to he observed, according to our view, would he that for every movement made by Russia a corresponding movement should he made hy ourselves, but that each movement should he accompanied hy an invitation to open a discussion with a view to the resumption of t\w status quo. We may interpolate the remark at this stage that should an advance he ordered under the conditions above predicated °into Seistan, we do not think that the entire cost should he borne upon the Indian revenues. The expedition would he undertaken in defence of imperial interests, and not exclusively or mainly for the protection of India, which would hardly he endangered, for instance, by a Russian occupation of Tabriz. 10. We will suppose that one or other of the steps above enumerated has been taken by the Russians and followed hy ourselves. The question then arises— What will he the probable consequence of our action ? W e desire to impress upon His Majesty’s Government the enormous value of the leverage that we should thus be able to exercise upon the Russian Government. It will, we imagine, he generally conceded that the ulterior objects of Russian policy in Persia are three in number, viz. (1) to reach the Persian Gulf, (2) to acquire such control over the Government and the interior of Persia (partly hy pressure at Tehran, partly by railways and Russian troops) as to convert Persia into an exclusively Russian market, and (3) by means of (1) to he in a position to apply pressure to yet one more vulnerable spot on the flank of Great Britain. The occupa tion by British forces of Seistan and of the mouth of the Gulf would be a serious, if not an insuperable, barrier to the realisation of these ambitions, and we entertain little doubt that, if persisted in, they would before long bring home to the Russian Government the advantages of an early discussion and settlement with ourselves. It is unnecessary at this stage to examine the terms that might then be agreed upon. The entire situation is hypothetical, and we are not con cerned with more than the preliminary stages in a probable course of evolution. 11. There is, however, one aspect of the case upon which we lay the greatest stress. The surest, indeed the only, preventive of such action on the part of Russia as we have here discussed is that she should know ^ in advance what will he the consequences of her action. If she is fully convinced that a move upon Tabriz or Meshed will be at once followed hy a British move in the south, and particularly upon the Gulf Ports, she will probably think twice about a step that would risk so much for so problematical a gain. We understand that under instructions from the Marquess of Lansdovvne, Sir A. Hardinge has mmskalready spoken to the Ain-ed-Dowleh, the head of the new Ministry in Persia m general terms somewhat to the above effect. But the knowledge of the Persian Government is a very different thing from the knowledge of the Russian Government: and it appears to us, if the policy that we recommend finds favour with His Majesty’s Government, that its first condition, and the most effective guarantee that it will not be required to take practical shape m circumstances of international complication, will be that the Russian Government should he clearly informed of the action that our reiterated p edges to uphold the integrity of Persia will compel us, in certain contingencies, to take. We even think that the knowledge that Great Britain is thus prepared to resist the destruction of the independence of Persia might predispose the Russians to enter upon ^ a discussion with us as to the sole means, apart from artificial resorts, by which that independence can be permanently maintained namely, financial and administrative reform. 12. We now pass to an examination of the wider issue that would be raised by an invasion in force of the whole of Northern Persia by the Russian arms In such a case we think that our reply is equally clear. We would retaliate by the occupation of Seistan and of the port and islands of Bunder Abbas. We would land a British force at Bushire for the protection of British interests and the support of constituted authority there. We would do the same at Moham- merah in support of the authority of the Sheikh, who, there can be little doubt, would welcome our appearance. In all these places we would explain that we came to save the country from disruption and to vindicate the existing order. At. Mohammeiah it would be for consideration whether our commercial or political interests on the Karan River required the despatch of British troops to Ahwaz or Shushter. We would, however, most certainly not leave out of sight this most valuable corner of the Persian dominions, both because of its intrinsic importance, because of the known sympathies of its Chiefs and people with the British cause, and because, if we leave the field open, others will not fail to enter it. 13. There remains the question raised by Sir A. Hardinge, whether the occupation of Mohammerah and the Karan River should be followed by a military advance upon Isfahan. We think that the answer to this question must depend upon two contingencies, on neither of which is it possible to pronounce with any exactitude at the present time. A good deal would turn upon the personality and action of the Persian prince or official who happened to be Governor of Isfahan. Were the present Governor, the Zil-es-Sultan, who is the elder brother of the Shah, and has well-known British sympathies, to be in office, and were British or Indian troops to appear upon the Karan, we think it extremely likely that he would press us to send a contingent to Isfahan for his support. Given a strong Governor at Isfahan, and the existence of conditions in which our presence would be welcomed by the people, we think that such an invita tion might be deserving of consideration. The appearance of British troops at Isfahan would certainly do more than any other step that can be contemplated to convince the Persians that we were in earnest in desiring a return to the status quo ante, and that Great Britain had to be reckoned with as well as Russia in the future disposition of the country. Neither can we think that the situation is at all likely to be realised that has been contemplated in some of the papers, viz., that at such a moment, when British forces would be in occupation of Seistan, the mouth of the Gulf, Bushire, Mohammerah, and Isfahan, the Russians would issue an ultimatum to us to retire from the’ latter place. For in such a case, whatever might be her prospective triumphs on land, Russia would be compelled to forego all hopes of satisfying her ambitions with regard to the sea. But there is a further contingency upon which, even more than upon the personality or inclinations of the Governor of Isfahan for the time being,we think that the answer to the question must depend. This is the degree of confidence that we might repose in, and the extent of assistance that we might hope to receive from, the tribes occupying the belt of country to the west and north-west of Isfahan. If the Bakhtiaris, Lurs, and other tribes in that neighbourhood had in the interim composed their internecine feuds, jf we had been able, by means of levies or road guards upon the Bakhtiari (Ahwaz-Isfahan) and Luristan (Dizful-Khorremabad) roads, toacquaint the picked men of the tribes with military drill and discipline, jf they were found to possess stamina and courage, and if we could rely upon their loyalty, then we think that a forward move upon Isfahan might be an even more advantageous venture, and that a Eussian advance in that quarter would he exposed to a flank attack that she might not care to encounter. We do not at present place any great reliance on the fighting capacity or strength of any of the tribes to which we have referred: and we cannot feel certain without further experience that they are capable of common action even in defence of their country. We are, however, strongly in sympathy with the proposal to introduce some sort of military organisation among them, and this is a subject upon which we shall separately address you. Eor the present we can only say that the idea of a forward movement upon Isfahan, as part of the general strategical plan, is one that in our view ought not to be lightly or hastily condemned, but that its execution must depend upon conditions which are at the present moment of too hypothetical a nature to justify us in treating them as the basis of a confident forecast. It must also depend upon the nature and numbers of the Eussian advance, since we are alive to the danger of sending Eritish or Indian troops to an advanced position where they might be in danger of being isolated, and where it would be difficult, if not impossible, to support them. 14. We have now discussed, from such knowledge as we possess, the question which was remitted to us by Lord George Hamilton; and we trust that our conclusions may meet with your general acceptance.
