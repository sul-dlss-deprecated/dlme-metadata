I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant THE POLITICAL AGENT BAHRAIN jsb/TRANSLATION . To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Regarding the woman from Aden who is the wife of my father Ahmad hin Yusuf abu Shaqar. I respectfully beg to state that last year, there was a house at Hura, which was suspected of 'being used for immoral purposes, where the said woman used to go frequently. We warned her not uo go there but she did noc. listen to us. She has a room on our main house which has a ’hadgir’ ( wind ventilator ) on the road side. On last Wednesday the wall of the ’hadgir* ( wind ventilator ) has been opened. This act and the fact that she has been entering the aforesaid house made us to suspect that she was of immoral character. Having seen a man coming through the ’badgir’ we prevented her from opening it but she did not hear what we said to her and has opened it. ’therefore, I had to ash one Sanad bin Abdullah to be a witness. On Friday night at 3.30 I came to the house, accompanied by Jabr bin ’Abdullah ad-hausari, in order to s^eeu and when X inspected the doors of the house and those of the room I saw that her room was locked from outside but there was light inside the room. I was*surprised to see this and had suspicion about her. I knocked the door but there was no reply. The doors of the house were locked from inside and I did not wigh to open her room when I had no one with me. I soon went out and called for Sanad bin ’Abdullah al Banqi who came with me. We opened her room but lound no one there, but while I was inside the room and Sanad was standing at the door oi the room, I noticed the feet and clothes of a man who was trying to come down through the badgir. I immediately ran after him and called for Sandd ( to help ) but I was only able to catch his clothes for he managed to be outside while I was inside the room holding his clothes. When Sanad reached me the man got himself set free, by leaving his clothes behind and was able to escape. I then left Sanad in the room and went out and called Jabr bin ’Abdullah ad-Lausari and asked both of them to witness. All this happenedhappened when the woman was not present in the house. Sanad then went out to his house and I closed all doors of our house an and made my wife and Jamilah, the wife of my brother, to sit in her ( Maryam’s ) room and watch. While they were sitting there the woman came from over the wall of the house and entered the room where my wife and Jamilah were sitting and turned them out from it. When I came up and ashed her how hew did she manage to enter, she replied that she entered by leaping over the wall. I also ashed her from wher^did she come at that time to which she said that she, together with a woman from Hura, came from some people who were playing drums. I submit for the information of the honourabe the Political Agent that we are from the respect acle families and it is not fit for us to do such things. There fore we request you hindly to remove this blot which has stained our honour. She is a foreign woman from Aden and also of respect able fejniiy. She was brought to this country by my father who lost his sense during the last 11 years. I am the in-charge and am responsible to do what would oe good and is in the interest of all. About a year ago ner people heard auout the sickness of ; ray father so they wrote to ’Abdul .’Aziz al ’Ali requesting him to make enquiries about the sickness of my father and about her state and behaviour. He informed them of the fact. Last year her people wrote to the office of the Resident at ^den who in turn wrote to the Political Agency, Bahrain, asking them to pay expenses and repatriate her. The Political Agency sent the letter to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government who called Doth of us before him. She ( Maryam J refused to go ( to Aden ) and we took it to be very kind of her. On making enquiries, however we came to know that she was leading a bad life which is not good for our honour or that of her people. This woman is of immoral character and my father Ahmad Din Yusuf is now of unsound mind confined in the house. Therefore, I request that you will kindly call her before you and order her to go back to her people and I undertake to pay for her expenses to her country, as we do not like to live with a woman of this kind who is of immoral character. I and our family are also in danger for thethe reason that she brings outsiders to our house when we are sleeping. Purely this man would not have ventured to come had she not 1^4 arranged with him the time and ha.d other previous arrangements. We request your honour to prevent this act of great harm to us. We do not sleep the whole night for being afraid from outsiders who are made to enter ur house, when we are sleeping, by this woman. hated the 7th Muharram 1353 ( i.e. 22nd April 1934 ).
