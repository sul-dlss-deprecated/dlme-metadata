Persian G-nlf Dear sir, Aiasrican Mission Bahrain, ? ersian Gulf March 30, 1949 As you may kno^ , the American Mission has been in charge of the Christian Cemetery in M'anama for more than half a century. This is the only place there non-Muslim foreigners in the Bahrain area may be buried. Both Homan Catholic and non-Catholic Christian burials are performed in this cemetery. It has become necessary to enlarge the Christian cemetery. Hish Highness the Sheikh of Bahrain has generously granted a piece of property immediately to the east of the present cemetery. This property should be enclosed p’ith a suitable wall. Present plans for landscaping the area should be* carried forward. To do this it will be necessary for the European and Indian communities in Bahrain to raise the amount of money required. If your organization would feel free to use the services of the Christian Cemetery in the time of necessity, may we ask you to respond to this request by making a contribution for this necessary enlargement to the grounds. Estimates for the work average about three thousand rupees. Checks and gifts may be made payable to the TT Christian Cemetery Account' in care of lev. Edwin . .

KVA- American Mission Bahrain, Persian Gulf •October 13, 1949 H.B.I . T s Political Vgent The Agency Manama Bahrain, Persian Gulf Honorable Sir, About one year ago it became obvious that the present Christian Cemetery in Bahrain would have to be enlarged. Since this cemetery is the only place available in this area for the burial of non-Muslim foreigners as well as Christian natives, and since the foreign population has .increased rapidly in recent years, the humber of burials £er annum has increased rapidlir. Sheikh Suleiman, the ruler of Bahrain, very graciously granted a piece of property for the enlargement which was directly beside the present property. The new piece of land doubled the surface area of the cemetery. We apuealed to the merchants and firms of Bahrain who would feel obliged to use the Christian Cemetery in time of necessity to make a contribution toward erecting a reasonable wall to enclose the new area. The receipts totaled Rs.4945-9-0. With this we proceeded to build the wall. The actual cost of the wall and new gate and two new water-pools for the irrigation of the new area omounted to Rs.5976-2-0. Since the American Mission is carrying on with this nuhlic service which in-other sheikhdoms, I understand, has become the duty of the Agency, I wonder if we may request the assistance of your office in balancing this deficit, quite obviously, we need Rs.1030-9-0 to comnletely settle the outstanding bills for this necessary community oroject. I will be happy to speak to you personally at your convenie: on this matter, if you so desire. for the Americah fission Edwin I . Luidens ^ Respectfully yours, -n. &gt;dU&lt;wNo.R-465-16/33 Political Agency, Bahra&amp;n, October 23, 1949. Dear Residency, Our note No*R-219-16/33 of May 12. The American Mission has written to us again about the Christian Cemetery asking for assistance in clearing off a debt of over a thousand rupees incurred in making a wall, a new gate and two irrigation pools. In our note under reference a suggestion was made for the resumption, from Mission Funds, of payments of the former Agency grant of Rs.50/- a year that had been discontinued. We doubt whether this is a proper charge on the Mission Fund but in view of the former practice of making a contribution from official funds and of the presence in Bahrain of both Residency and Agency we consider that the Department might be disposed to authorize the continuance of the former payments. (Is not a former member of the Residency staff.buried in this cemetery?) We anticipate no difficulty in per suading local business firms to pay off the debt hut they may well expect us to contribute too. Yours ever, Agency.

On the 17th March 1937 I saw Mr. van Peursem about his proposed circular for funds to pipe water for the cemetery. I said that when subscriptions had been raised for wailing in the cemetery in 1933 there had been a cer tain feeling , if public subscriptions were asked for, that the accounts of the money should be open to the public. Mr. van Peursem told me that he had a separate cemetery fund which could be seen if any one wished to do so. It was quite separate from the moneys of the Mission. I said that I thought that it would be a good thing to make this clear as it would encourage people in the matter of subscriptions. 2. r also pointed out that the''last two sentences of his circular might possibly be misunderstood as it was possible to read them (as both Mr.Belgrave and I had read them) in a somewhat mandatory way. I sug -ested a slight amendment making the circular more of a request and less of a demand. 3. Mr. van Peursem will send round tne amended circular shortly. He mentioned that an Indian friend had already taken one of them to the Jebal and that the Company apparently did not like subscription lists but had. made a donation.
