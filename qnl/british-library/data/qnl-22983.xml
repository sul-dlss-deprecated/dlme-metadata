According to paragraph 5 of the note the new Head Clerk will draw only one third of the Agency share instead of Rs.100/ hitherto drawn. The question now arises whether I am a new H.C.- I am not a new Head Clerk but I am only returning from a long leave and in the past, I have enjoyed this privilege 3. Another point for consideration is, that at present I am drawing the maximikm xaf pay of my grade and there is no, any future hope*whilst I am in Bahrain to get any annual increment. 4. I have a suggestion to make on this subject. The present system of working this account is as follows:- Joint Court Fees collected during the month - say Rs.220-0-0 Remitted to Bahrain Govt: half 3s. 110/- P sgf therernaindPT'' half, pa^td' expense ^^Cgr the month Retained by the Agency ... (only).. ' 100 /- ' 10 /- 220 - 0-0 As the Bahrain Govt: get half the fees collected, it is only fair that they should also bear half the expenses and therefore from April onwards this accounts should be shown as follows : - J.C.Fees collected during the month - say - Rs.220/- Dedact expenses for the month M 100/- Balance .. Rs. 120/- Paid half to Bahrain Govt.... Rs. 60/- Retained by the Agency .... ' 60 /- fl 120/- If this system is followed, I do not think, there will be much difference for the Agency. 5. Last time, when I was here, P.A. was kind enough to allow me to stay in the rooms called ''Sepoys 3arrack ff (now about to be demolished)• Since ray arrival here I am in trouble and cannot get a decent house nearby the Agency even if I pay Rs.40/- or Rs.45/- p.m. and all my house hold things are scattered about. Having regard to all these difficulties, I hope and beg that P.A. will be kind enough to allow me to continue the privilege hitherto followed.Agency Unoffi ci al Funds Account. Ydth immeaiate effect the term Agency Miscellaneous Fund will be substituted for that of Slave Relief Fund, which is misleading. Lieutenant Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain. hrDEPOSIT ACCOUNT . Present System . 1 . Register No. 5 is received from the Indian Assistant's Court and the entire contents are copied into the Deposit Register for court cases and Estate cases. This is a waste of time and is duplication of work. 2. The Accounts Clerk makes payments on behalf of the court. This is wrong and the account should be kept by the court. The Accounts Clerk cannot be expected to identify every individual drawing money. I suggest that /i/oney received by the Indian Assistant should be sent here at regular intervals. The Indian Assistant should never ha.e more than Rupees 100 in his safe at the close of the working day. Money sent infill be received by the Head Clerk and the accompanying chalan will be receipted by him. The money will be deposited and an entry will be made on the credit side of the Deposit register which will in fact become a cash book. Payments will be made by the court and receipts will be obtained in Register No. 6 in the form of a signature or thumb impression which will be initialled by the Indian Assistant. Money to make payments will be obtained by the Indian Assistant sending a requisition to the Head Clerk. The money will be withdrawn from the safe and an entry will be made on the debit side of the Deposit register. Undisbursed money should be returned for deposit when the total in the Indian Assistant's safe exceeds Rupees 100. I have talked the matter over with Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiym * Abdul Haiy and he is agreeable to doing his own payaents. ^ - u ' T.t. ^rtTTcL tWr 0lMw 0 I,A. Please note,Ciialan No. ^ate.
