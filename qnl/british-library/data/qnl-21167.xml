He&gt; From:- First Class Assistant Surgeon R.Holmes,I.M.L., M.O i/c V.M.Hospital.,Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to request that this my application for an extension of duty at Bahrain may be favourably considered is at present sanction this tour will expire on the 4th August 1932 and I request that it may be extended by a further period of two years. I nave a useful knowledge of both Arabic ana Persian ana I fee}, that I can render more useful service to the Government of India in my present post than in any other to whicn I am likely to be posted. During my service in Bahrain the Laily Siak attendance has increased from four thousand to just over thirteen thousand, this year and I venture to put forward this fact to show that my services have been appreciated by the local inhabitants. I have the honour to be Sir, Your iiiost ^beaient Servant, (Sa). R.Holmes, Assistant burgeon.C's. P. P.—L (iii) 126-500-4-31. The Agency, Bahrain, No. C/2o. Dated the 7t.U i 'ebruar/ '932. • From The Political Agent, BAHRAIN, P. To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, i have the honour to refer to mj Ic-ttar tlo:12/C cieteci the Gth February 1930 anc to forward an application oy Assistant Surgeon R.Holmes for an extension of two years of nis tour of duty at Bahrain. 2. i have nothing but the highest praise for this officer's services to the Bahrain tUste ana to this Agency. Ke is universally liked and his personal influence nas been such that the daily sick attendence at hit&gt; hospital nas increased from 9,41J in 1330 to 13,Iil4 in 1931. This phenomenal increase has been very largely due to the fact that rianrani women now attend his hospital freely, these bei%- the most oigoted of all the inhabitants of the island^.arttt wno will not even visit the women f s hospital of tne ijaerican Mission. 3. Further as you are aware / Hiy Excellency Shaikh Hamad suffers from diabetes and when a locum ten ens acted for Lr.iiolmea during % his leave he suffered a severe set backus he is a bad patient and will not carry out tne instructions of one he has not full confidence in. As you are aware,i'or Shaikn A .amad to predecease his long lived father would be a disaster tne consequences of which could not be foreseen. 4. I need hardly add that witn the increasing tide of American influence.in Bahrain we do not wish to tnrow Snaikn Hamad into the hands of the doctor of the American ission. 5. Lr Holmes has a fluent iUio^ledge of ^raoic and Persian xa and is by temperament ideally fitted for nis task. • 1 feel certain tuat there is no other post to wnich ne isJ® 2. likely to be appointee vhere he can render such valuable services ana where his special qualifications can be so useiul, ana since he is a servant of tne Oentral Government it is clearly in its interests tiiat he shoula be employea to the best advantage. As you are aware,it is extremely aifiicult to find suitable persons for these out of the way posts,and both of his locum tenens have Deen quite unsuitable,tne latter particularly so. Further,if the officer himself is suitable his family frequently create difficulties and embarrassments- 6. i would most strongly urge,therefore,in the interests of this igency,the Bahrain Covermnent and of the Government of India itself that the services of Dr.Holmes snoula be retainea for anotner two years- i nave the honour to be Sir, Your ^ost Obeaient Servant, Political Agent,Bahrain. j/^ /&amp;{, ^'- si2. 4* lie has been smocessful in oTercosaing the scruples even of Bahrani women sufierers,whose bigotrj forbids them to risit the women f s hospital ol tne American ^issionyana he is regarded with uauaual respect smong all cotaaunities of tne local people• b. I would especially urge hie retention in Bahrain on political grounas- in the first plscejhe hos great influence with iiis iixcellenc/ Sheiith Haiiiad bin T isa Al Khalifah,who sulfers from aiaoetes and does not take Kindly to mecical treatment, and espeoiall/ to e liraited aiet. it would be most unfortun ate if His excellency's health were to fail at the present time (as it undoubtedly would if he were to have a ^eaical Officer to whom he paid less scrupulous attention than he does to Assistant Surgeon IIoL&amp;es} for we have in him a Baler excellently disposed to us ana willing to be advised — and this fact it ol the first importance to us in view of the various important dv ,velopEients,which are taJcing place in and near Bahrain. in particular, the plans of the iSahram Petroleum Company Limited show that the next year or two will see the establishment oi a considerable American oil field. Assistant Surgeon Holmes has charge of certain of the personnel and 1 would be soost unwilling to see this charge fall into tne hands of the American iisaion,!! it can be avoided* The importance of the quarantine work will increase with tne coming ot tanX ships,and it is desirable that the quarantine arrangements shall,from the outset,be in the hands of a Leuical Oflicer, who has experience of the work and of the conditions obtaining in Bahrain. /».3 6. i would only adc tiiat Assistant burgeon Holmes is eminentl/ suiteu to the appointment by his Knowledge of Arabic ana Persian end by his popularity both with the local inhabitants and with the members of the British ana American Communities* ?. I have ascertained from Assistant Surgeon Lolmes that he would welcome this further extension of his appoint ment. 8. Finally,! would earnestly beg your support of this proposal,as I feel that our position in the r ersian Gulf is so menaces by ioreign interests that we can aliora to neglect no means of maintaining and improving it. f.e shoula,therefore, be unwise not to retain at Bahrain the services ol a Mtuical Oflicer,who is so fitter for the appointaeut uid who has so established himself in public esteem.

Holmss, Indian Medical Department, to commissioned rank» My recommendation is based on two reasonsx- (a) the desirability of such promotion on the grounds of its suitability, and (b) the necessity for it. 3. As regards its desirability. Assistant-Surgeon Holmes during the thirteen years he has been in Bahrain has devoted himself whole-heartedly to his work and made the Victoria Memorial Hospital an Institute which can vie with the much larger, better staffed and better equipped hospitals of the Arabian Mission. The proof of this fact can be deducted from the increasing number of patients attended to by Assistant- Surgeon Holmes, which has risen from 5,79G in 1 •: f8 to 16,479 in 1934. In addition Assistant-Surgeon Holmes 1 ability as a doctor is so well known that he is preferred by the Shaikh to to all others. He enjoys the full confidence of everyone from the highest to lowest. He is also Quarantine Medical Officer /andand Medical Officer of The Bahrain Petroleum Company. He Is extreir-ely popul&amp;r both as a doctor and socially amongst all classes* the advent of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Naval Base to Bahrain, the appointment should be converted into one of commissioned rank# Assistant-Surgeon Holmes is on the same footing socially as his brother doctors in the Navy, all of whom are of commissioned rank, and is certainly treated and regarded in that manner by them. The fact that as a subordinate he is expected to mix with commissioned officers makes his position anomolous and difficult. To substitute a commissioned officer for him would be a disservice to Bahrain, for however competent or able such doctor might be, he could never establish for himself the place in the hearts and minds of all classes in Bahrain which Assistant-Surgeon Holmes holds# 4. As regards the necessity for his promotion. With I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Captain, Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain.11th February 1 £~G. My dear Prior, May I bother you with the follovlng small point. In reply to a recommendation for Holmes to be promoted to Commissioned R&amp;nk I 1 as informed in August 13Z5 that his name might be recommended in April next year C 1j26), provided his case meets trie provisions of paragraph 10, Appendix XXVII of the Regulations for the Army in Inciia» I find that we have no copy of the Regulations here and it vouid take a long time to get a copy from BusUire, even if they have them.

The honourable the Po-itical i^esident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I xtension of the tenure of the appointment of Assistant-surgeon R. Holmes, I.r.D., as Quarantine Medical Officer, lira in. S-'r, I have the honour to refer to rry letter No*C/8-c/3 dated the 6th January 1 74 in which I made a proposal, • hich '/as s nctioned, that A iri stant- urgeon H. p-.ir.f s f tenure of appointment as a Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf should be extended by tvo years to the 5th August 1 j ?6. S. I no^ recommend that ais tenure of the a; pointmcnt of Medical Officer, Victoria Memorial Hospital, Baiirain, shall be extended b a further ^eriod of two years. ?. Assistant-Curgeon Holmes is in good health and . vould welcome this further extension of his tenure of his appointment, and the reasons (his hospital work, his influence with His Fxcellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin r Isa A1 Khalifah and his work as Quarantine 1 edical Officer), which I adduced in support of ray previous roposal have now even greater i'orce. The responsibility of the Medical Officer as /Quarantinewarn p. Cuarontine Medical Officer has been Increased by the regular visits of tankshlps (vhlch will incr&lt; est in nurber v .hen work on the Hefinery is completed about July of this year, 1.3- C) carrying avsy oil from The Ba rein Petroleum Company's field, and merchant ships of rerlous foreign lines, German, Japanese and Italian, are calling more frequently at Bahrain, it is also orobable that the French and Dutch air lines T.iii call ^t Bahrain in the near future. 5. In the past tv/o years I heve on a number of occasions had to send Assistant-Surgeon Holmes to do v.ork on the Trucial Coast. Ordinarily I should not have felt Justified in ordering him av ay from his important work in Brhrain, but I have done so in certain cases in order, for exaim^le, to give urgently needed attention to the Ehalkhs and in connection T.ith epidemic outbreaks' of smallpox at places on the Crucial Coast. For^ political reasons it is undesirable that such Y :ork should be left to the Arabian (American) Mission and Assistant-Surgeon Holmes has succeeded in establishing along the Trucial Coast the same regard for his ability as a medical officer and for his charatter as a man, as he has done in Bahrain. I am anxious that ve should use every possible means of Increasing our influence on the Trucial Coast ant of keeping out foreign influence, as important oil and air developments are in progress. f. I venture again to beg your su ort for my proposal on th&lt; ground of pressing ublic Interest, becu^ise in the present circumstances in the Persian Gulf we can afford to lose no means of maintaining rnd strengthening our position. I have the honour to be ^ir, Xour mosjt^ obedient servant^ iileut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain. -n New Delhi, the 18th February 1936. My dear Colonel, @ I Please refer to your letter No. 0/66-3/3, dated the 11th February 1936. I enclose an extract giving the provisions of paragraph ^10 of appendix XXVII, which I hope is what you want. I w^w.-ia certainly do what I can for Holmes when the reconniendation comes along, but I hand over on the 15th of torch and it is possible that it may not arrive by then. If it does not come, I will speak to Alington and Caroe about him. He certainly deserves something for the excellent work he has done in Bahrain all these y^ars. Yours sincerely, Lieut. Colonel G-.

From:- ijieutenant-CQa.onei. Gordon joch, C.I.E., Political A^ent, Baixrain, To:- Sir, The Honourable the Political Resident •in the Persian Bushire. Assistant-Surgeon R. Holmes^ Medical Officer, Bahrain - xiecommend- ation for pronL^tion to Commissioned Rank. I have the honour to refer to a Memorandum ^o: F«Sl(3)-E/35 dated the 5th August 1^35 from the Under secretary to the aovernment of India in the Foreign and Political Department to you, in v ;hich it was stated that the name of Assistant-Surgeon R. Holmes, I.M .D., might be recommended in April 1936 provided that his case met the provisions of paragraph 10, Appendix XXVII of the Regulations for the Army in India. S. I venture to think that Assistant-Surgeon Holmes 1 services are of such a nature as to bring him witnin the scope of those orders. 3. The excellence of his medical v:ork in Bahrain is apparent from the figures of attendance at the Hospital for the last eight years:- lag8. 5,736. 1323. 7,165. 1330. 3,410.lo Ke has, mreover, been successful In overcoming tne scruples even of the Baharinah women, -whose bigotry forbids them to visit the women's hospital of the American Mission, and he is regarded v;ith unusual respect among all communities of the local people. He speaks Arabic and Persian fluently and has attained a wide knowledge of the people and their customs. Apart from his medical work among the local populace, he is called in by the British and American communities, who place rnach confidence in him# 4« Assistant—burgeon Holmes has, by commendable tact and perseverance, succeeded in influencing to acceptance of regular treatment His Excellency Shaikh £ir HaBcd bin 'Isa A1 Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, v^ho suffers from diabetes and does not take kindly to medical treatment and especially to a limited diet. The political value of keeping in good health a Ru^er exce-lently disposed towards us and willing to accept our advice is very great, in view of the development which are taking place in Bahrain (for example, the establishment of the Naval Base, the air route, the establishment of an oil field). 5. Assistant-Surgeon Holmes is the Quarantine Medical Officer for Bahrain. The post is not an easy one to fill, as it involves dealing with merchant vessels of various nation alities (German, Italian and Japanese) and also with American, Norwegian and other tankships. The v .or i calls icr an Uigh degree of tact and commonsense. He is also entrusted with /MedicalMedical attendance upon the employees of Cable and tireless Limited and of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation limited and upob the Asiatic employees of The Bahrain Petroleum Company limited# 6. Thougii he can ill be spared from Bahrain, I have on a number of occasions (as have predecessors) had to send Assistant-Surgeon Holmes to the Trucial Co^st, both to attend inciividual Shaikhs ana others, to carry out general medical work and recently to help combat a serious epidemic of small pox, and he lies made for himself tnere a position among the Shaikhs and people comjarabie to that which he has made at Bahrain. This work is of especial value, as it serves to keep out the American influence which would otherwise be brought to bear on the Coast b the doctors of the Arabian (American) Mission. ■ 7. The effect of his work as a whole is acimirable and is of real value in our difficult task of maintaining the British position in the Persian Gulf. Certain of his achievements could only have been reached by a man of outstanding character and ability. 8. Apart from his own services there is a further reason why I should be glad to see Assistant-Surgeon Holmes promoted to commissioned rank. His work takes him asongst the Officers of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and the Merchant shipping of different nationalities and brings him into touch with persons of varied nationalities and all walks in life, ^e is welcomed by all with whom he comes in contact, but it would, I consider, be of advantage to him and of value in the conduct of # public business, if he were to nave the privilege of commission^ rank.

Weightman, Esquire, I•C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Jub.iect ;- Extension of the appointment of Lieutenant R. Holmes in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospi tal, Bahrain. I have the honour to refer to the Government of / India memorandum No. D.1006-S/36 dated the 7th April 1936, sanctioning the extension of the appointment of Assistant Surgeon (Lieutenant) R. Holmes as a Medical Officer in the Persian Gulf up to the 6th August 1938. 2. Lieutenant Holmes has now applied for a further two years 1 extension of service in his present appointment, and I do not hesitate to recommend most strongly that this exten sion be granted. Lieutenant Holmes continues to enjoy excel lent health and is in every way fit to continue service in Bahrain. • / I ^ 3. It is unnecessary for me to repeat Xhe arguments adduced by my predecessor in his letter No. C/67-3/3 dated the 12th February 1936 when recommending the current extension of Lieut enant Holmes' employment at Bahrain, and I need only say that those arguments continue to carry undiminished weight. It did not take me long to learn, on my arrival here, how enviable a reputation Lieutenant Holmes has earned for himself among all communities and classes in Bahrain and how great an asset he is to the Bahrain Agency. Indeed I regard his retention(50 in Bahrain until August 1940 at least is a matter of very considerable political importance. As is known, the Bahrain Government are anxious to develop their Medical Department and it is of 'the utmost importance that^ during the next two years of its infancy Or. Kolmes should 'be here to aid and / I / . y t. guide it with his immense medical knowledge and experience. While I hold it unjustifiable to expect that the work of the Officer in charge of the Victoria Memorial Hospital, who per forms also the duties of Quarantine Medical Officer, will di minish appreciably in the next two or three years, I do never- theless look forward to the possibility that as the Bahrain Medical Department grows so will the Agency Doctor be able to devote more attention to the Trucial Coast, where Lieutenant Holmes is already well-known and greatly respected. It is evident that the inauguration of any form of medical service on the Coast (so long overdue) will benefit exceedingly from the guidance which only an officer of Lieutenant Holmes 1 attri- butes and experience can impart. 4. .'hile writing this letter I have received a communica tion from the Regency Council on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, from which I quote the following M We wish, on behalf of the Ruler, to express apprecia tion of Dr. Holmes 1 long and valuable service in Bah rain and we request that if it is possible his period of service here should be renewed.' 5. I venture to express the hope that you will support this recommendation in view of your personal knowledge of Dr. Holmes• work and character, and of the requirements of this Agency, of Bahrain and of the Trucial Coast alike. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL.
