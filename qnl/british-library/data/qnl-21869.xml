Bus hire • Political \gent, Kuwait* Political \gent, 3ahrain.&gt;/ Political Agent, Muscat* / IP No* 323-B Of 1^39. Dated April, m 9 . 2**1 ec , t . ; ? ar emergency Legislation in the Persian Gulf. ^ I enclose copy of ( f O )raft Persian Gulf States (ISmergency) Order in Council, and ( b) jraft Defence Regulations under (a). 2. The general idea ie that on the outbreak of war and for its duration the Resident and the Political Agents under him must be given special legislative powers. That these powers should be embodi- in a draft Order in Qouncil and draft regulations to be kept in readi- ness fir application on the outbreak of war. The draft legislation in question is embodied in (a) and (b), which are tne result of long consideration by His Majesty's Government a nd myself. Actual war conditions may reveal points which h a v e not been covered in thlp drafts. Article 2, however, of the draft Order in eouncil gives the / Political s. e. MFI 1 —785S&amp;P—(M-lOlil—18-8-33—2,00 000.d) z - 2 - Political Resident full powers to make and amend Regulations and by the exercise of these powers the Resident can fill up such gaps as may come to light* 3. (a) and (b) can of course only apply to persons unaer our Jurisdiction. I had suggested to Hio Majesty’s Govern ment that the Political Resident should be given special powers over all inhabitants of the Arab states but there were legal difficulties in the way of adopting this sugges tion. 4. We shall therefore have to depend on the Rulers for applying war legislation to the persons under their jurisdiction, and the best Way to do this would be for them to issue Alans when a &lt;d if war breaks out. tiuch Alans would correspond to Articles 2 to 7 of the Defence Regulations and paragraph 2 of the Notice thereto. 3. It is obvious that before drawing up these Alans the Rulers will require seme time for consideration, and it is equally obvious, as I pointed out to His Majesty’s Govern ment, that such consideration should take place now and not on the outbreak of war. His Majesty’s Government have agreed and the scheme is for Political Agents to approach Rulers verbally on the following lines. That in the event of war the Resident would issue certain local regulations affecting persons under his Jurisdiction and that it would be essential for the Rulers to issue correeponding Alans to deal with persons under their jurisdiction. That it was desirable for the Rulers to have the actual text of such Alans drawn up confidentially beforehand, so that in an / emergency-3- 3 G emergency they coaid be published immediately. in the mean time of course such Al&amp;ns would be kept strictly confidential. some of the provisions of the draft Alan amongst which will be the death penalty corresponding to paragraph 2 of the Hot ice. If they take up this attitude it should be explained to them that as a deterrent it is essential that publicity should be given to the death penalty, and that whetner this is actually carried out will depend on tne Ruler'i' discretion. It can further be emphasised to them that all thd provisions tke Alan would apply only for the duration of the war. 7. I hope to be able to send you a draft Alan by this mail, if there is time to catoh it, or by next mail. In the meantime you need take no action. 8. 3ome points of (a} and (b) are still under considera tion but these do not affect the Articles of the Defence Regulations on which the Alans will be based. 9. for the Trucial coast we have no order in Council and so no war legislation will be applicable there. 10. The Trading with the iSneay Regulations (Article 3 (2) of the draft Order in Council) are unaer consideration and a further communication on this point will be made in due course. 6 It may be that the Rulers will hesitate at accepting Attested sd.

Sub.iect i- War Emergency Legislation in the Persian Gulf. OUT PiQfarence paragraph 3 of my secret Express letter No. C/263 dated the 19th April 1939. 2. I visited Rayan on the 9th May and discussed this matter with the Shaikh of Qatar for some hours. I introduced the subject on the lines of paragraph 5 of your Express letter No. C/323-S dated the 8th April 1939 and the draft Alan was read over to him in Arabic. The Shaikh and his son Hamad were intensely suspicious and began by saying that they could not understand the terms of that Alan. On these being explained in simple language they then said that it would be impossible for them to deal with foreigners on the lines suggested. I reminded them that I had just told them that I would deal with non-^ Moslem foreigners and that they would not be involved except possibly in aiding to seize the persons of such foreigners. They then said that they could not possibly implement such an Alan without consider able assistance from the British Government. Conditions in Qatar were different from those in Bahrain and Kuwait and they would need protection and aid from us. I reminded them that they had a guarantee of/- $. 44. MFP—985 S&amp;P—(M-1597)—27-11-36—10,000. $3 /- - 2 - of protection ©gainst external aggression and that much assistance hod been and was being given to them in other ways, e.g. in obtaining rifles, probably in obtaining light lorries with machine guns mounted, and so on. Their next objection was that the publication of the threat of death sentences would rouse the population against them. I said that it would probably never come to a matter of a death sentence, but they persisted that the very suggestion would cause half the country to rise. After further long argument I repeated that I was merely asking them to agree to an Alan which would assist them in dealing with their own sub* jects who might indulge in hostilities against the British Government and the Shaikh of Qatarj they appeared to be trying to make me believe that they were incapable of managing their internal affairs and their repeated statements that they would require so much aid from us made me wonder if they were about to request me to take over their country. This produced a better attitude, and the Shaikh said that I might rest assured that he would do all in his power to co-operate with us in war and to prevent any of his subjects acting in a hostile manner towards us. Nevertheless he held that an Alan on these lines was dangerous and he thought we should leave it to him to carry out his promise in whatever way was best from the Arab point of view. He might have to kill some people, he might have to bribe others, and some he might have to kiss on the nose l He requested me to send him a fresh translation of the Alan, since ha said the version read over to him was in very 'Persianised' form and he would then send me a satisfactory reply. I thought it best to undertake to give him a fresh translation and this will be sent in the course of the next day or two.3- 3. I think it is probable that the Shaikh of Qatar will refuse any Alan however drafted, but I anticipate that he will send some reply indicating his readiness to co-operate by such means as he may possess. In that event I would re commend that we should not press him on the question of the Alan and content ourselves with such an undertaking. 4. The attitude adopted by the Shaikh of Qatar is typical of what might have been expected from the Trucial Coast Shaikhs if we had approached them with a similar request.
