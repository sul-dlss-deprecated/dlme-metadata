H. B. M T s Political Agent, Bahr ain. Lemorandun: - -&lt;r &gt; /. /f 7 His Highness Shaikh Salman is considering the desirability of sending.one of his relatives, Shaikh Ibrahim bin Shaikh Lohaned bin Isa, to Bgypt in order to study for a year or two in one of the Egyptian Agricultural colleges. He has asked re to make enquiries about the possibility of Shaikh Ibtahim being accexoted there as a student and to ascertain the tuition fees. No information is available here on the subject so I should be grateful if you could make an enquiry from Egypt. Shaikh Ibrahim has a ce tain degree of education though he did not attend any Secondary School, at the time when he was of school age no Secondary School existed in Bahrain. He is genuinely interested in agriculture and h^s acquired some knowledge of the subject from reading Arabic books. He knows a certain amount of English. I believe that normally a Secondary School education is necessary for people entering the Agricultural College but possibly the authorities in Egypt might be induced to waive this in the case of Shaikh Ibrahim. His a 0 e is 27. I should be obliged if you could obtain any information on the subject from Cairo.
