There is some difficulty in getting any detailed information on the subject, as those of the Sheriffs entourage with whom we have had contact seem to know very little of the feeling of the people at Taif. They merely say that they are confident that the Grand Sherif is fully acquainted with all that goes on in Taif, and can be counted upon to keep the situation in hand. The presence of some 3,000 Turks at Ebhah, however, and the facilities that must exist for corresponding with their agents in Taif, make it probable that there is much anti-Sherifian intrigue in that town. The Sherif stated that he intended to go to Taif as usual this hot weather, and indeed, invited Wilson Pasha and the writer to accompany him there. His presence in Taif should do much to improve the feeling of the townsfolk. As regards Jiddah, there is little to be said. The popu lation is so varied—consisting of the mixed products of many a generation’s pilgrimage—that no Arab feeling as such can be said to exist. Jiddah, even more than Mecca, lives solely on the pilgrim age, and its policy and its sentiments are entirely influenced by material considerations dependent upon it. The Jiddawa would, in many respects, prefer a British occupation to any other solution of the present situation, and in their hearts believe in its advent. They have no loyalty for the Sherif, and showed very little interest, and no enthusiasm, on the recent occasion of his visit. Active hostile intrigue is at a discount at the present moment owing to the presence of Sherif Muhsin as Governor. The heavy hand of this official has some considerable reputation in an area that includes, but also goes far beyond, the boundaries of Jiddah. Sherif Muhsin’s personal courage and complete devotion to the Sherif, together with his hatred of the 1 urks, makes him an entirely desirable and suitable appointment in Jiddah, and, so long as he is there, a tranquility amounting almost to paralysis may be counted upon.

With Ibn Rashid, the Emir at one time hoped to come to terms but that hope has died with the former s open acceptance of Turkish allies and provision of assistance to the Turkish forces in Heiaz • and Sherifs Abdullah and Feisal have declared their intention of dealing faithfully with Ibn Rashid as an irrecon- cileable foe once they have done with Turks. Finally, the Imam Yahya is not personally hostile to the King of Hejaz, while his greatest vassal, Nasir Mabkhut of the Hashid, is inclined to be friendly ; but neither is free at present to adopt a foreign policy tn that, of the Turks. Certainly at the present moment the prospect of Arabia united under either the King of the Hejaz or anyone else seems very remote. The “ Arab Cause ” is evidently a very weak cement in the peninsula ; dislike of the Turk is stronger, and a desire to stand well with us is perhaps stronger still. Should the Turk disappear, it is the last bond which will have to take the strain. The Arab Advance on Wejh. When the deadlock in the Medina—Hamra area declared itself in October, 1916, the new idea of an attack on the Turkish rear at El-Ala, by way of Wejh, was brought forward. The situation in the South was that the Turks held Medina too strongly for direct attack by the Arab forces, and that Feisal held the Kheif—Milif hills too strongly for direct attack by the Turkish forces. In the rear, almost blockaded in Rabugh, lay Sidi Ali profitlessly with his army. Feisal decided to carry out the northern expedition to Wejh, and to do it himself. He, therefore, brought up Sidi Zeid to Wadi Safra, and transferred to him the whole of his Harb forces and his Southern Juheinah. He then withdrew to Wadi Yambo to organize a force of Northern Juheinah for the march on Wejh.While he was in Wadi Yambo in early December the unexpected happened. The Arabs under Sidi Zeid became slack and left a by-road near Khalis unguarded. A Turkish mounted infantry patrol pushed up along it into Wadi Safra near Kheif. The front line of Arabs, hearing news of this enemy six miles in their rear, broke with a rush to rescue their families and property in the threatened villages. Zeid’s main body followed suit. Zeid himself fled at top pace to Yambo ; and the astonished Turks occupied Hamra and Bir Said unopposed. This situation made Feisal’s march north impossible. He moved into Nakhl Mubarak with his forces and the still trembling remnant of Zeid’s army, and after a few excited days fought a long range action against a strong Turkish reconnais sance. In this he found his troops lacking in many respects : his centre and right wing held and repulsed the enemy ; the - left wing (Juheinah) retired suddenly behind his centre, without hostile pressure. He suspected treachery and ordered a general retreat on Yambo, the next water supply. The defaulting left wing refused to retire, put up an independent stubborn resistance against the Turks for another twenty-four hours, and then reioined Feisal at Yambo. It explained that the retirement during the action was to find an opportunity for brewing a cup of coffee undisturbed. The army of Sidi Ali at Rabiigh was stirred into life by these events and began a sudden advance of its own towards Bir ibn Hassani, in spite of Feisal’s appeals that it should wait till he was in a position to support it by a thrust from Tambo. Ali persisted in his movement, and Feisal eventually collected what men he could and hurried out to Nakhl Mubarak again. He was preparing a stroke against Kheif and Hamra to synchronise with Ali’s arrival at Bir ibn Hassani when he got news that Ali’s forces had fallen back sixty miles on hearing a (false) report of the defection of the Subh He therefore, retired again, in a very bad temper, to INakhl Mubarak. The move on Wejh now appeared not merely the convincing means of securing a siege of Medina, but an urgent necessi y i “kish advan! on llecca was to be prevented. Colond Wilson came up to Yambo and pressed point on Sg Feisal, who agreed entirely, but pointed out rthat “^ ab f Wilson gave Feisal his personal assurance that the Kabugh gan ison W ilson gave r capable ot resisting any fckLlf attack until Fe^al had occupJ Wejh. There was no means of giving force to this assurance, but it seemed a rea ®° na means g b since without it Feisal would not nave Mecca to proceed to Wejh at once.— 62 — a \ fflptor in our hands was Sherif Abdullah The other Arab factor £ orce i n being north-east with an untarnished reputa 10 ^ military importance.

The operation involved a flank^ march'of* about 200 miles parallel to the Turkish communi- cations by an inferior fighting force, leaving, its base (Yambo) entirely undefended, and evacuating its only possible defensive position (Wadi Yambo) in the face of an enemy force of nearly divisional strength in Wadi Safra, not thirty miles away across easv country. The manoeuvre was only made possible at all by the absolute command of the sea and the ungrudging co-opemtion in transport of ammunition and supplies afforded Feisai by the S.N.O. Red Sea Patrol. The situation at Yambo appeared likely to be so insecure that all possible rifles and ammunition were embarked from the town store-houses before we left. ^ Sherif Abdullah fortunately fell in with the Wadi Ais scheme, and said he would arrive there on January 11. Feisal, therefore, fixed January 20 as a provisional date for his attack on Wejh. Actually, Abdullah was not able to reach Wadi Ais 4-ui ir.wnr.wvT 17 orwl TTaisal rhd not T*f*a,ch Weill till Januarv 25. The occupation of Wejh is of importance, since it means a prolongation of the Arab front along the Hejaz railway by rather more than 200 miles, the accession to the Sherif s cause o£^ the Billi, and later of the Beni Atiyah and Huweitat. Its direct military value is that it is the only possible base for operations against El-Ala, which is the vital point of railway communication between Syria and Medina, and a base for the future. Sherif Abdullah’s occupation of Wadi Ais rendered possible Feisal’s move north to Wejh, and Abdullah’s occupation was indirectly secured by the operations at Arish and Rafah.FeisaVs Order of March. (i). Yambo to Um Lej. From Owais, Feisal moved to Akhdar (water), and thence to Nnbt (water), and so to Um Lej. He_ took five days over the journey, which is one of only eighty miles, and experienced great difficulty for lack of water. I was not able, owing to difficulties of the local situation at Yambo, to travel this stretch with the army, and can give no details of the route. The troops were given six days rations, and ordered to cany two gallons of water per man. The order of march was that the force was divided into nine sections, each under a 8 her it or sheikh of importance, and instructed to march separately to Um Lej, and concentrate there. Actually ther e. P r ^ ^ ,y e fi no water at Um Lej, and so Feisal camped a* Bir el-Waheidi, five miles north-east of the town. He reached there on January 14, and in the next four days was gradually pined bv his other contingents, who settled down at all available water-holes in the district. (ii). Um Lej to Wejh. The more serious part of the march was that from Um Lej to Wejh. The best road for camels is up the coast, to \\ adi Dhulm and then to Abu Zereibat for water. The drawback to the road is that the sixty miles between Semna and Abu Zereibat have no permanent water. For this reason an interior road, from Semna to Khuf, Towala and Abu Zereibat is usually chosen as well-water exists at each station. Between Yambo and Wejh there is no single spring of thr ee wells depend intimately on the rainfall, which to the kst three h as been almost ml. In consequence, little water is any where obtainable, ami the supply o£ tor^e preaenta sernous one day, now costs s . g consequence, all the animals Saw sA-stXiXSS: carrying capacity is impaired and th an d 4,000 For the transport of his army ot 4,U b and re dif to infantry (tl/army is o^-lXiUsuns and llfmounted- each camel), monntain-gnns mac in a)1 He carried infantry, Feisal had 380 bagg g rounc is of 2’95 eight days food, ^'Xu^eserve o^S A.A ove°r the 100,000 ammunition and a small rese , rounds of the machine-gun companies, on these 480ssaammm — 66 — o£ Feisal’s), are much below that of a Turkish or European force Feisal’s mountain-battery, in the hands of its Egyptian personnel, required 360 camels for its proper transport Since the Egyptians have been replaced by Arabs, the ba tery has moved with thirty-two camels for two-day marches and on this expedition of fourteen days found less than eighty sufficient. The same quantity of ammunition was carried in both cases. At Bir el-Waheidi Feisal heard that casual rain-pools had formed at two places on the coast road, and decided to take that road to Abu Zereibat with his own guard and three other sections of the army. He ordered the rest to march by Khuff and Towala. The local Arabs (Musa Juheinah) on whom we had to rely* for local information and as guides proved most un reliable. They were never able to say what the yield of any well really would be, or where and how far off the wells were. The numbers of Feisal’s armies are much in excess of anything which tribal warfare has conceived, and the Juheinah—being uneducated —have no unit of time smaller than the day, or of distance longer than the span and shorter than the stage, (from six to sixteen hours march, according to your wish and camel), and cannot realise a number larger than the digits. Inter-communi cation between units of the Arab forces is often hindered by there being no person in a force who can read and write. In the circumstances a great deal of delay, confusion, and actual danger for lack of water and food occurred on our march, which would have been obviated had time allowed of previous reconnaissance of the route. The animals were without food for two and a half days, and the army marched the last fifty miles on half a gallon of water per man and no food. This did not seem in any way to affect the spirits of the men, who trotted gaily into Wejh singing songs and executing sham charges ; nor did it affect in any way their speed or energy. Feisal said, however, that another thirty-six hours of the same conditions would have begun to tell on them. T. E. L. Midian. The Capture of Wejh. [Precis and Extracts from a Report by Captain A. N. E. Brat, 18th Bengal Lancers.] On January 21, 550 Arabs, consisting of 400 Juheinah under Sheikh Salih ibn Shefia, and 150 Bishawa under Sheikh Amr, who had been brought from Yambo and Um Lej, embarked at Hassani Island. They reached Sherm Habban the o owing day, and were joined there by the several ships which were sent to co-operate with the Arab attack. Suleiman Pasha Rufudah, paramount Sheikh of the Billi, neanng that feisal was marching up the coast from Um Lej,had cleared oat of Wejh, leaving Ahmed Tewfik Bey, O.C. Ageyl Camel men, in charge. The latter also retired before the morning of the 23rd, leaving 100 Turkish infantry in the town, and another 100 Turks in a position on the high ground about a mile east of the town, on the edge of the escarpment which falls suddenly to the inland plain. The town of Wejh stands at the south-western corner of a small coralline plateau, bounded on the west by the sea, on the south by the wadi, and on the east by the inland plain ; the plateau rises gradually to the east, and ends in cliffs along the wadi and the inland plain. About eight miles up the wadi, at the entrance to the foot-hills, is a fort, to which part of the Turkish force had retired before the action began. The 550 Arab troops consisted of inferior material, which was not fit to accompany Feisal’s army; and they had no real leaders. As events turned out, however, they were destined to play the principle r61e, and considering all things, did extremely well. The landing began at 7.15 a.m. on the 23rd. One of the warships began the action by firing at the Turkish trenches on the eastern scarp at a range of rather over 2,000 yards. The Arabs divided themselves into three groups : (1) About 1UU who really meant fighting, and advanced directly against the Turkish position on the eastern scarp; (2) about 300 who moved along the beach and incontinently went off to loot and fight in the town ; (3) about 100 who sat on the beach and did nothing during the whole operations. Group (1) was divided into two parties (a) about twenty- men under the above-mentioned Sheikh Salih, and (5) about eio-htv men. The first of these parties advanced at a very sharp pace straight towards the Turks, who were in position about 2,000 yards away. “ At 1,000 yards they came under fire ’ ^ took no notice, and showed no excitement. Indeed, t y anneared but for the pace they were walking, to be out for an ordinary constitutional. When within 500 yards they halted a moment or two to see exactly where the fire came from, and without taking advantage of any* cover or extending o a y unusual extent wandered on till they eventuaUy halted in some dead ..round within fifty yards of the Turks. Here they remained firing snap-shots and crouching down again, suffering m casualties 'whatever, but inflicting a fair number on them opponents. There was no noise or confusion and th affair might have been a manoeuvre with blank. The ™°f “'“T ® themselves ^rom the”r companions and, calmly sitting on a small— 68 — ground on their flanks, the Arabs now built small stone sangars, and five of them remained there as long as the action lasted. When this part of the ground was gone over next day, three dead Turks were found in addition to eight large pools of blood. The Turks numbered thirty-five to the Arabs twenty, and the Arabs suffered no casualties whatever. “ Meanwhile, party (b), about eighty strong, swung round and engaged the Turks further south. These men behaved in a similar manner and remained cool in action till ordered to retire so that the naval guns might shell the Turkish trenches. They retired quietly and extended, walking slowly away and taking no notice of the stray Turkish bullets amongst them.” The main Arab force rushed in a compact mass straight for the town and at once began looting and fighting in a completely disorganized manner. The Turks fought very hard in the town from house to house, and the Arabs suffered a fair number of casualties. However, by the evening, they had driven the remnant of the Turks into a few houses at the extreme southern end of the town. The night, which was windy and cold, passed without incident. At 7.45 a.m. on the 24th, a naval landing party sent a detachment of fifty men and a machine-gun to outflank the Turkish position on the Eastern escarpment, which was badly exposed from the rear. On reaching the rising ground, that had been held the previous day, they found it had been evacuated, most of the Turks having retired to the fort in the hills leaving a few snipers in the plain. This was searched by the machine-gun and further trouble was stopped. Remarkable practice was made by one of the ships, with an up-ended 4*7 gun, against the distant fort, at the very long range of about 14,000 yards. A shell was dropped in the middle of the fort at the third shot. The lurks did not wait for further experiments of this kind, and, when Feisal reached the fort next day, he found it completely evacuated. Meanwhile, fighting proceeded in the town. By the morning of the 24th some forty Turks had been taken prisoner. The naval landing-party moved back from the scarp toward the town, and twenty-one of the prisoners were handed over to them, one of whom volunteered to go in with a white flag and secure the surrender of any lurks still holding out. However, when this was done and the houses were searched, no more Turks were found a ive. 1 he town was in a state of utter confusion, and had been ransacked from roof to floor. In the mosque was found a dead lurk with cartridges, the bullets of which had been cut off at the top to make them expand. •n u iri ^ orrria fi on was received that some Turks were sti °‘d ln g out, and shooting from a tower on the south side of the Wadi There also appeared to be Turks holding SOm V- c - 111 the vicinity of this tower. These were shelled accou mg y, and covered by a machine-gun party from the nor lem ank of the Wadi, while a naval landing party made aspirited charge up the trenches to the tower. The Turks were found to have fled. Hearing the commotion, some of the Arabs in the town began long-range fire on their own account, not without danger to the naval landing party. They were, however, soon controlled, and this ended the operations. On the following day, several small parties of Turks were rounded up by Feisal’s army, which reached Wejh in the night of January 24 and 25. The total Turkish losses were about 110, of which three officers and eighty-two men were taken prisoners. While a seaplane was up on the morning of the 23rd, the observer, Lieutenant Stuart, E.F.C., was mortally wounded. He was the only Britisher killed. One seaman was wounded. NOTES. Nejd News. The following information about Central Arabian matters, past and present, is based on notes of a conversation with Sherif Feisal. “ About five years ago Ibn Saud began to move the people of Western Nejd against the Meccans. He sent Seyyids and preachers among the former, and taught that the people of Mecca were kufar and quite intolerable in such Holy Places. He won over to his side (by various arguments) some of the Buqum and Sebai, and threatened Taif. This stirred up the Sherif of Mecca, who took effective counter-measures. In consequence Saad ibn Saud was sent down to arrange terms of peace. By mediation all Wadi Dawasir (to the point where it becomes Wadi Ranyah) was recognized to be Ibn Saud’s, and Wadis Kharmah and Bishah and Ranyah were confirmed to the Sherif. Ibn Saud was recognized as overlord of all the Rahtan, and the Sherif as overlord of the Ateibah. The trouble about the Ateibah is that they are a Hejaz stock, recently moved into Nejd. Geographically they should be Ibn Saud’s, but by origin and custom they are Sherifian. Two years ago Ibn Saud again got active, and sent agents among the Ateibah and other tribes. So Sherif Abdullah went out over the whole dira, further than ever before to the East, and received again the allegiance of the Ateibah.” Feisal regards Ibn Saud as very powerful, but at home only ; for his forces are not organized, and he cannot move abroad in great strength. I noticed, as before, among the Hejaz Arabs and their leaders strong distrust and dislike of Wahabi principles and sectaries. Feisal is informed that 300 Turks with two mountain-guns, have been put under Ibn Rashid’s orders in Hail. They are unpopular, and local disturbances in Hail recently ended in the deaths of two of them.— 70 — Shammar. The Senha section of the Qahtan are wild.

Khamsieh, has received confirmatory evidence of the statement of Dhari ibn Tawalah to the effect that Ibn Rashid intended to move against the Sherif, and has been delayed owing to the inability of his agent, Rashid ibn Lailah, who has been purchasing supplies in Nejf, to arrange his safe passage (with the provisions purchased) through the tribes which lie en route from Nejf to Hail. A.P.O. Khamsieh, reports on December 9, that, according to his information from Samawah, Attiyah abuGallal, a secular leader at Nejf, has written to the Samawa tribes urging a Jehad against the Turks if the latter should make any advance on Nejf from Hillah. This latter news is similar to our latest reports regarding the anti-Turk Jehad from Nasiriyah. A.P.O. Nasiriyah, has received a letter from Haji Attiyah, a strongly anti-Turk Sheikh of Nejf, stating that the numbers of the tribal confederation gathered in revolt against the Turks amounts to 25,000 men. This figure is no doubt exaggerated, but G.O.C. 15th Division considers that a general gathering of the tribes round Hillah with offensive intent against the Turks is to be accepted, though he considers that the tribes have not yet committed themselves. Sheikh Mohammed Kadhim Yezdi, the religious dignitary of Nejf has not actually declared a Jihad against the Turks, but is said to have given encouragement to the tribal rising. Haji Attiyah sent copies to the A.P.O. for distribution of his appeal to the Nasiriyah tribes, calling upon them to avenge Hillah. Haji Attiyah invites the British to advance on the -Euphrates, and join his tribal forces. This tribal gathering, if once it commits itself before those w o compose it disperse, should be of value to us in attracting urk.ish Mitention and encouraging the Turks to detach on this side issue.SECRET.

The Hejaz has been fortunate in having very little history during the past two or three weeks, except in respect of its preparations for the campaign north of Wadi Hamdh, which has begun with the occupation of Wejh, Dhabah and Muweilah, the chief port-villages of Midian. Ali claims to have occupied Mijz on January 24, after a successful action with the detachment holding the place: the latter seems to have been engaged in the open and was possibly trying to withdraw in accord with the general plan of concentration on Grhayir and Bir Derwish. Next day, however, an enemy aeroplane made a raid on Ali’s main camp, causing some dozen casualties, and he withdrew a few miles to the southward. The same day one of our planes bombed the main Turkish position at Sath el-Ghayir. On February 2, an aeroplane again visited this Turkish camp and dropped bombs from a height of about 2,300 feet. &lt;Six out of the eight bombs took effect, and if the tents and shelters were occupied at the time the damage done must have been considerable. The aeroplane was subjected 0 to machine-gun and rifle fire, not from the camp but from the outpost. The number of tents was slightly reduced since the previous raid. Another aeroplane reconnaisance on February 4, revealed no sio-n of any enemy on the Fura road in the Bir el-Abbad district, Sidi Ali’s camp on this date was seen to be at laqur el-Shifaiya. However, since then he himself has been in Rabugh to recruit, leaving Sidi Zeid and Nuri Bey in charge. There have been three more raids by tribesmen acting inde pendently against Turkish cbnvoys south of Medina _ Two of these raids were undertaken by the Hawazim and the third by the Rahalah. The last seems to have been the most successful and important, the captures including two officers, thirteen rifles, and 100 camels. A telegram from King Hussein to Cairo, dated February 8, states that the Turkish forces have evacuated their posts on the Sultani road except at two places within twenty-five kilometres from Medina, but that they have left a considerable force at Ghayir and on the Fura road to resist any advance on Medina. A report has been received from Jiddah that the railway .line has been cut since January 29, but, so far, this is not confirmed. Condition of Medina.

With the Northern Army. [The following are excerpts from a Report made by Captain T. E. Lawrence, to Lt.-Colonel Wilson on January 8, 1917.] Route Notes. On January 2, 1917, I left Yambo and rode across the plain to the mouth of Wadi Agida in five hours. From the mouth of Wadi Agida to the watershed into the Wadi Yambo basin was one hour, and thence to Kakhl Mubarak was one hour ; all doneat a four miles an hour walk. The lowest third of the ascent of Wadi Agida was over sand : soft, slow going. The upper parts were harder and better: the divide was low and easy, and it gave at once to the eastward, on to a broad open valley, coming from the left with only very low hills on each side (Jebel Agida ?), down which the road curved gently into Nakhl Mubarak. The “ Sebil ” stands about 400 yards east of the watershed. The road down to Nakhl looked very beautiful to-day. The rains have brought up a thin growth of grass in all the hollows and flat places. The blades, of a very tender green, shoot up between all the stones, so that looked at from a little height and distance there is a lively mist of pale green here and there over the surfaces of the slate-blue and brown-red rocks. In places the growth was quite strong, and the camels of the army are grazing on it. In Nakhl Mubarak I found Feisal encamped in tents : he himself was in his private tent, getting ready to go out to his reception. I stayed with him that day, while rumours came in that the Turkish force had evacuated Wadi Safra. One reported that from Bir Sheriufi to Bir Derwish was one great camp, and that its units were proceeding to Medina ; another had seen a o-reat force of camelmen and infantry ride East past Kheif yesterday. We decided to send out a feeler towards Hamra, to get news. On January 3, I took thirty-five Mahamid and rode over a dull tamarisk -and thorn-grown plain past Bir Faqir (not seen) to Bir Wasit, which is the old Abu Khalaat of my first trip We waited there till sunset, and then went to Bir Murra, e. our camels with ten of the men, and the rest of us ^{^d U P the hills north of the Haj road up to Jebel Dhifran, which was painful for the hills are all of knife-like strata which are turned on idire and often run in straight lines from crest to valley. It gives you abundance of broken surface but no sound g rl ps, ^ the strata are so minutely cracked that almost any segment will come away from its socket in your hand. The top of Dhifran was cold and misty. At dawn we disposed ourselves in crevices of the rocks, and at last saw three belf tents beneath us to the right, behind a spur at the head of the pass, 300 yards away. We could not get round to them to set a low view, so put a few bullets through their top. This turned out a crowd of Turks from all directions They leaped info trenches and rifle pits each side of the road, and P° ttlll g them was very difficult. I think they suffered some loss, but 1 could not be sure. They fired in every that I expected us, and the row in the narrow valley was s° ^ ^Xady to see the Hamra force turn out. As the lurks were atreduy s r.vsS % y- *7 “tv; ss have been at their private morning duty. They were the most-— 7 6 — rasrs-ed men I have ever seen, bar a British tramp, and surrendered ^ once. We took them with us, and bolted off down the valley for another 500 yards. From there we put a few shots in to the lurks, which seemed to check them, and so got off gently to Bir Murra hv 6 30 a m The prisoners could speak only 1 urkish, so we mounted them and raced up to Nakhl to find an interpreter They said it was the 5th Coy. of the 2/55th Regiment which was posted on Dhifran, the rest of the battalion and two companies of the first battalion being at Hamra village. The other companies of the l/55th were guarding the Derb el-Khayaa from Hamra to Bir Ibn Hassani ; 3/55th m Bir Derwish ; O.C. 55th Regiment, Tewfik Bey. At Nakhl Mubarak I found letters from Captain Warren saying that Zeid was still in Yambo, and that the^ Dufferin would wait in Sherm Yambo till I came. As Feisal was just starting for Owais, I changed my camel and rode down with him and the army to the head of'Wadi Messarid by 3 p.m. The order of march was rather splendid and barbaric. Feisal in front, in white ; Sharaf on his right in red headcloth and henna dyed tunic and cloak; myself on his left in white and red ; behind us three banners of purple silk, with gold spikes ; behind them three drummers playing a march, and behind them again, a wild bouncing mass of 1,200 camels of the bodyguard, all packed as closely as they could move, the men in every variety of coloured clothes, and the camels nearly as brilliant in their trappings, and the whole crowd singing at the tops of their voices a warsong in honour of Feisal and his family. It looked like a river of camels, for we filled up the Wadi to the tops of its banks, and poured along in a quarter of a mile long stream. At the mouth of Wadi Messarid I said good-bye to Feisal and raced down the open plain to Yambo by 6 p.m. T was riding Feisal’s own splendid camel, and so managed to do the twenty-two miles fairly easily. To my great relief I found the “ Dufferin ” had already left for Rabugh with Zeid, and so I was saved a further ten miles’ march to Sherm Yambo. Arab Forces. The troops in Nakhl Mubarak were mostly camel corps. There were very many—according to Feisal’s figures, over 6,000— but their camps were spread over miles of the Wadi and its tributaries, and I could not manage to see all of them. Those , did see were quiet, and I thought in fair spirits. Some of them have now served six months or more, and these have lost t len enthusiasm but gained experience in exchange. They still preserve their tribal instinct for independence of order, but they are curbing their habit of wasting ammunition, have achieved a Tr routine in matters of camping and marching, and when e lent approaches near they fall into line and make the low ow am sweep of the arm to the lips which is the official salute. •Jp ( 0 no t oil their guns—they say because they then clog with sand, and they have no oil handy—but the guns are most ofthem in fair order, and some of the men know how to shoot. They are becoming separate but coherent units under their sheikhs, and attendance is more regular than it was, as their distance from home increases. Further, they are becoming tempered to the idea of leaving their own diras, and Feisal hopes to take nearly all to Wejh with him. As a mass they are not formidable, since they have no corporate spirit or discipline, or mutual confidence. Man by man they are good : I would suggest that the smaller the unit that is acting, the better will be its performance. A thousand of them in a mob would be ineffective against one fourth their number of trained troops : but three or four of them, in their own valleys and hills, would account for a dozen Turkish soldiers. When they sit still they get nervous, and anxious to return home. Feisal himself goes rather to pieces in the same conditions. When, however, they have plenty to do, and are riding about in small parties tapping the Turks here and there, retiring always when the Turks advance, to appear in another direction immediately after, then they are in their element, and must cause the enemy not only anxiety, but bewilderment. The mule mounted infantry company is very promising. They have got Mulud, an ex-cavalry officer, training them, and already make a creditable appearance. The machine-gun sections were disappointing. They say that the Egyptian volunteers are improving these and the artillery details. Gamp Life. The camp routine at H.Q., is much as follows—At 5 a.m. the Army “ Imam ” gets on to the best hill-top and calls to grayer 'He has an astonishing voice, and wakes up every man and animal in the camp. Immediately alter him Feisal s private Imam calls gently and musically by his tent A few minutes later a cup of sweet coffee turns up, for each ol us (Feisal has five slaves), and at 6 a.m. or a little later we go to breakfast with Feisal in his tent, where he has two modern, but not bad carpets, and a delightful old Baluch prayer rug. Breakfast in favourable moments may include Mecca cakes and cooked dhurra besides dates: after breakfast two little glasses of sweet tea are produced for each of us. From after breakfast till 8 a.m Fe.sal works with his secretary, or discusses things private y in his tent with imoortant people At 8 a.m. he gives audience in Ins diwan te, t which P is furnished with two bad kdvms. Hie routine is tor him’ to sit at the end of it, on one side, and callers or petitioners sit in front of the tent in a half circle, until he calls Them up to him. All questions are settled very summarily, and nothing is left over till later. At 11.30 a.m. he rises, and walks back to his living tent, where a little later we e^lect u h. 1 unch acain, on fortunate days, consists of several disnes. stewed thorn-buds, beans or lentils, with bread, and afterwards rice or honey cakes. They eat with fingers or spoons, as pleases them After lunch comes short delay of talk, while coffee and sweet tea turn up. Then till 2 p.m. Feisal writes, or dictatesFrobenius (calling himself Abd el-Kerim Pasha) turned up in Jiddah one morning by sea from Wejh soon after war had begun. Feisal was in Jiddah, and headed him off from Mecca. British naval activity dissuaded him from going on further south. Feisal, therefore, got him a boat, and gave him a letter o recommendation, and sent him back north again. When he got to Rabugh, however, Hussein Mubeirik took suspicion o mi and locked him up in the fort. Frobenius had some difficulty in getting out, and made great complaints ol his treatment when he got back to Syria. In March, 1916, Jemal Pasha took Feisal to a cinema m Damascus. The star film showed the Pyramids, with the Union Jack on top, and beneath them, Australians beating the Egyptian men and raping the women, and, m the foreground, an Egyptian girl in an attitude of supplication. The second scene showed /desert, with camel-convoys and a gn-fash infant y battalion marching on for ever and ever.

Oppenheim has hardly spoken to him since. In January, 1915, Yasim, Ali Riza, Abd el-Ghani, and others approached the Sherif of Mecca and suggested a military rebellion in Syria. The Sherif sent Feisal up to report. He found Divisions 25, 35 and 36 ready to revolt, but public opinion less ready, and a general opinion in military circles that Germany would win the war quite rapidly. He went to Constantinople, and waited till the Dardanelles was in full blast. He then came back to Damascus, judging it a possible moment ; but he found tne well disposed divisions broken up, and his supporters scattere 1. So he suggested to his father that they delay till England had been properly approached, and Turkey had suffered crippling losses, or until an Allied landing had been effected at Alexandretta. Rabugh Intelligence. The following information has been derived from examination of two Turkish prisoners at Rabugh, namely : Kaimmakam Ali Besim Bey, and Bash-Shawish (Sergt.-Major) Hassan Siam, Corps of Engineers :— On January 4, when close to Bir Ali, about six kilometres out of Medina, they were ambushed and captured by Arabs. Kaimmakam Ali Besim Bey, Corps of Engineers, Inspector of Wireless Telegraphs, left Damascus early in December and came to Medina to select a site, and erect a large wireless installation there. He visited Divisional Headquarters (Fakhri Pasha) at Hafah, the party consisting of three officers, two sergeants and small escort. Of the party these two were captured, the remainder fled. The garrison at Medina was only a small one, consisting of one company, no heavy guns, and two fleld-guns, 10‘5 cm. There were three field wireless sets : one at Medina, one at n Abbas, and one at Ghayir, none very powerful. These could not set )d to, but could receive messages from, Damascus. They were able to pick up all ship wireless messages, but were unable o ecode them, and are generally “ snowed under,” and ordered no o pick up messages other than their own.They stated no reinforcements had arrived at Medina for the last seven months, except aeroplanes—five in number—of which two are now broken, and a few details. The aeroplanes did not carry wireless, but perhaps maxims. There were no preparations for, nor any expectation of, reinforcements at Medina. A train was arriving each day composed of from five to ten coaches. The Hejaz railway line is guarded by a series of small posts between stations, apparently blockhouses, and the line is patrolled between them. The line is not enclosed by wire. Food in Medina was plentiful but expensive, and rations were quite good (but see later). The health of the troops in Medina and outside had considerably improved, and there was very little scurvy. Clothing was wearing out, and evidently difficult to replace. That the Hejaz operations were realised by the Turkish General Staff as of great importance to them, and that bakhri Pasha was considered one of the most able and energetic leaders of the Turkish Army Formerly the General Staff was of opinion that one division was ample to defeat the Bedouins and to undertake operations south of Medina, but latterly it had somewhat changed its mind, and our informants thought reinforcements would be asked for and sent. The Turkish Intelligence (almost entirely derived from native sources) reported the presence o£ Egyptian troops aeroplanes and hangars at Rabugh also large numbers of ships in the harbour ° the presence of British personnel was also reported, and that the latter were living on the ships. One of the informants, later, contradicted his previous statement about food, and said it was difficult to obtain it sufficient quantities, though there was no actual shortage. He stated 10 000 Arabs had been conscripted m Hejaz. They were employed on L. of C„ their loyalty being doubtful. All railway engines arriving at Medina are of good type and burning wood. Midian.

It appears that after the taking of Dhabah the Turkish remnant were pursued along the Tebuk road by Ahmed Rafiyah Tlx:: TJ nW pimt Fifty Turks are said to have been killed, the [ s belg rteaed bT cavalry from Tebuk. This is the first mention !f this Huweitat Sheikh, while the principal Huwe.tat chief Audah Abu Tayyi and his cousin, Mohammed Dhailan, are known to be loyal partisans of the Arab cause. Before the capture of Wejh on January 24, the Turks had been supplying Wejh from Tebuk via the Muweilah-Dhabah road and not from El-Ala, the road from Muweilah to Tebuk The boundaries of the Billi tribe run on the south from El-Ala down the Wadi Hamdh, and on the north from Kudr (Qalaat el-Akhdar) on the Hejaz railway, down Wadi Salmah to Naaman Island. The tribe is about as numerous as the Juheinah. There is still talk of Suleiman Pasha Rifadah coming in. His brother and most of his family are with Feisal already. The last news received of him is that, shortly before the capture of Wejh, he had retired to a place called Huweirah el-Jibliyah in Wadi Miyah, where he had about thirty-five tents. The Billi chief most favoured by Feisal is Hamid Rifadah, a cousin of Suleiman. This Hamid is about thirty-two years of age, of medium height and though friendly and intelligent of unimpressive appearance and somewhat lacking in distinction. Some of the Beni Atiyah clans are said to have come in also since the fall of Wejh. But so long as the Turks hold Tebuk in strength, (they are said to have 900 cavalry besides half-a- battalion in infantry in the place) this tribe will not come in as a whole. Now that the great mass of the Billi have rallied to Feisal, 1,500 Juheinah, who came up to Wejh, have been sent back to Wadi Ais to join Emir Abdullah. The latter has made his headquarters at a place called Murabba, and there he awaits Feisal’s advance inland before carrying out an attack on the railway. Reports state that the Turks are weakening the Medina garrison in order to concentrate on the railway. Isolated posts are being withdrawn and concentrations made at El-Ala, Medain Salih and Febuk. Basri Pasha is at El-Ala. The Medain Salih garrison is said to include four Germans.SYRIA. Extracts from Newspapers. El Balagh. January 2, 1917.

The seaplane was flying the French flag, and therefore, it has become an established fact that a French flag has waved over the Holy Places. This is one of the “good results of Hussein’s rebellion.

Two locomotives were employed. One of these was taken off at Sarghaya. Between the latter and Zebedani the accident took place, apparently owing to the engine leaving the rails at a curve. The whole train telescoped, and piled on to the engine. One coach was precipi tated into the ravine below. The killed and injured numbered about 400.

NOTES. Kuweit News. Sheikh Jabir, reigning prince of Kuweit, died on February 5. We have not heard any details. He has been succeeded, pro visionally, by his brother Salim, who has still to be recognized by our Government on his intimation that he is prepared to accept all his predecessor’s obligations towards us. Sheikh Salim las not enjoyed a good reputation in the past, and has been credited with being both dissolute and fanatical: he was long on bad terms with his father, Sheikh Mubarak.v SECRET.

North-Eastern Desert. Tribal Fights in the Shamiyah. [Compiled from Arab reports, recorded by A. P. 0. Zubeir.] Human nature being what it is—and at bottom the same in the Arab as in the European, pugnacious, ambitious and covetous, sometimes loyal but mainly treacherous, occasionally enlightened but always restless—the tribal fights in the Shamiyah desert may be expected to exhibit the same to and fro, change and interchange, of alliances as may be found in the history of the relations between the various nations which compose Europe. The redeeming feature of the picture is its comparative blood lessness. Normally, an Arab fight means the taking of an enemy by a surprise raid, and the casualties may be in some cases more, in others rather less, than those of a football match. As a ru e, no prisoners are taken. By that phrase, ill-omened as it is to us more barbarous Europeans, it is not meant that they are killed A man who surrenders gives up his rifle, his horse, and even his clothes, except the bare minimum that will save a blush. He is then let go. At times, however, the fight is waged without respite and without mercy, and, considering e numbers engaged, with sanguinary results. The history of these fights has its own intrinsic interest, apart from any lesson it may convey about the possibility of relating the tribes together under the influence of an external power. For those concerned, the story lias landmarks as great to Bedouins as are Hastings and Waterloo to us. What to Ibn Rashid and Ibn Suweit are Hastings or Waterloo compared with the battle of the Reeds or the battle of Naba ? o i r&gt; u i-n We will begin from the time when Saadun Pasha, the Muntafiq chief, had been driven back from north ^ and made the Shamiyah desert his own particular ^ anViPrp of influence The great Muntafiq family or baadu not native to Iraq by origin for they boast themselv^ descended from the nobles of Mecca—had built itself a ring , forts extending from Ghabashiyah through Chabdah an Shagrah to Abu Ghar and Neba, a ring of defiance to any attempt of the alien Turk to reduce them proud souls to sub- •S The great Saadun had once carried his arms to he walls of Basrah itself. . When the disciphned forces of t^ rp Vo oi Ipno’ih drove this unruly element into the aeserr, ■s'’*** » a claimed himself king of the Shamiyah. • But there was another enemy bes^e the Turk. J he se d forts were both a defence against the inevitable raids ot^.ra enemies and a base for their tenants'own ^ ™e Bedouin has, I* a tn Php Redouins it is a legitimate ebullition Ki~r.fi “i— -a *'«' *i»' •'* rules of International Law with us. To return to Saadun, if one man could be regarded as king of the desert more than another, it was Ibn Rashid, the great Sb_ Emir His traditional enemy Ibn Sand, Emir of Neid, was at this time at the lowest ebb of his power There wa no one to contest Ibn Rashid s supremacy. W hen therefore Saadun Pasha set up his standard in the Shamiyah Ibn Rashid said: “This cannot be. There cannot be two standards in the desert ” Whether his or Saadun’s actions were influenced by secret encouragement from the Turks, it is difficult to say. At any rate, some sixteen years ago, rumours came to the environs of Khamisieh that Ibn Rashid was preparing a great raid on Saadun. Saadun, therefore, collected his forces and made all ready to repel the attack. Besides Muntafiq tribes, he had with him the Dhafir, a Bedouin tribe derived in part from Hijr, north of the Hejaz, which had long ago been driven thence and had settled’in the district between Koweit, the Shammar and the Euphrates. I his tribe in its day has been as stiong as any in the Shamiyah. In the time of the present Sheikh’s grandfather, Sultan Ibn Suweit, or of his brother, Jalan, its easily dissolved elements were united by the personal influence of the Sheikh. Without such personal influence, the temptations to disunion are obvious from the position of the tribe, situated as it normally is between Shammar and Muntafiq, and, therefore, requiring to have influence with both sides. On this occasion a number of the Dhafir were with Saadun. Many of them did not enter into the affair at all. The Muntafiq and the Dhafir together were ready for all emergencies ; but no raid came. Thinking they had been collected by a false alarm, the tribes to a great extent dispersed, Saadun himself remaining encamped east of Khamisieh by the reeds. This was Ibn Rashid’s chance ; and one day Saadun’s followers observed a mysterious cloud of dust on the southern horizon. They sent out the usual scouts who returned to report the coming of a host of Shammar'. It was too late for all Saadun’s followers to flee. He himself escaped towards Sakhariyah. The Shammar easily defeated the rest, and captured a great booty of horses and camels. This was the well-known battle of the Reeds ( El- Bardiyah). Ibn Rashid encamped for a time at Tell el-Jibarah and then retired to his own country. Saadun Pasha, desirous of avenging his defeat, took advantage of a quarrel between Mubarak Ibn Sabah, Sheikh of Koweit, and Ibn Rashid to ally himself with Ibn Sabah. A famous merchant of Koweit, one Yusuf el-Ibrahim, w r ho had seceded from Mubarak after his act of fratricide (he had killed his two brothers, Mohammed and Jara), went over to Ibn Rashid. Mubarak, angry at his defection, employed some of his wealth in the arming^ of Ibn Saud, and readily accepted the invitation of Saadun to join forces against-the common enemy. This time 1 a an Ikn Suweit, Sheikh of the Dhafir, refused to join theconfederacy. The three, Saadun, Ibn Sabah and Ibn Sand joined forces in Nejd. But Ibn Rashid was too strong for them, and defeated the confederacy with ease in a battle known as u El-Turafiyah,” from the place where it was fought. This took place the year after the battle of the Reeds. After this time there appears to be a lull in important events. Though there were continual raids, there was no fight of any importance. Ultimately a quarrel arose between Ibn Sabah and Saadun. A section of the Dhafir, called Es-Said, consistently friendly to Saadun, captured a number of Ibn Sabah’s camels. Ibn Sabah asked Saadun to procure their return. He refused, and his refusal led Ibn Sabah to call^ in aid from Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud was not strong. Two of his tribes, the Muteir and the Ajman, had left him. Hence it was only a meagre force he sent to the help of Ibn Sabah. Such as they were, their forces reached Arkhamieh, where they were surprised by a mixed body of Dhafir, Zayyad, and Muntafiq (including the Budur), under Saadun. The Zayyad are not a Muntafiq tribe. They belong to a confederacy known as the Beni Mucheim, and dwell south and about Samawah. But their friendship with the Dhafir dates back to many years ago, and bodies of them continually appear in Shamiyah fights. There was no real battle on this occasion. The forces ot Ibn Sabah and Ibn Saud were captured without a struggle. tie 110 ® this event is known as the Hadiyah or “ the Gift. That sue events are possible is only intelligible to those who know the distance and pace that can be accomplished by Arabs intent on a raid. The u Hadiyah” took place in the spring nine years ago. The following summer Saadun went to Baghdad on a visit to the Wali, Kadhim Pasha. The Muteir, a Nejdi tribe normally of the following of Ibn Saud, heard of tHs and judged it a good opportunity for a raid. They came to Ibn Sabah and said Now that Saadun has gone to Baghdad, there is great chance of booty from the Dhafir and the Muntafiq. Let us make a raid upon them ” Not loth to attempt revenge upon the Dhafir tor his late disaster, Ibn Sabah and the Muteir made a considerable raid on the Dhafir at Shagrah, and succeeded m capturing much boo y. News of the raid came to Saadun at Baghdad and was reported to the Wali. The Wali offered to establish Saadun m the position of Emir of the Iraq tribes and Koweit if he would overthrow Ibn Sabah. Saadun always ambitious, agreed to t nroiect and set out to collect his forces. Among others he took lie'hhf sS^- rm going from Koweit ° r the' leaders of ‘this' fife maVe g ot a Saadun noble, Yusuf el-Mansur, was— 90 — his quest ; but though still enterprise.

He!'! it was arranged that live of the Dhafir chiefs should go as hostages with Ibn Rashid. So the parties dispersed ; but the Em r! chiefs, whether of their own free will or under the secret nersuasion of the captive Dhafir, came to the Em,r and represented the harshness of his judgment Had not the Dhafn already paid their fine of 500 camels ? Was it just, further, to takecaptive five of their chiefs ? The Emir was convinced by their arguments and released the hostages two days after he took them. As might be expected, the liberated chiefs hastened to their tribe, intent on revenge, collected their h-hai and “ Jais,” and overtook and routed Saadun and his following, south of Shagrah at El-Jaraibiyat. Saadun retired to Khamisieh while the Dhafir settled in the environs of Zubeir, at Safwan and Shwebdah. One section of the Dhafir, the Saud, were at the time with the Shammar, but now came to join Saadun at Khamisieh. Saadun and his following with the addition of the Saud moved to Alowi. This was within easy distance of the Dhafir, who straightway collected their forces, drove Saadun out, and returned to their tents. The Turks had chosen this time to send agents to Basrah and to approach Saadun on the question of making him Emir of the Dirat el-Muntafiq on the Shatt el-Hai. Mubarak Ibn Sabah was then at Muhammerah and had got into touch with Seyyid Talib. It is said that he offered Seyyid Talib 3,000 liras to persuade the Government to seize and imprison Saadun. Seyyid Talib agreed and represented to the Turkish agents how fatal a policy it would be to make a turbulent spirit like Saadun head of a combine of tribes notorious for its unruliness. “ Let me only bring Saadun to Basrah” he said “and the rest is easy. What follows is famous in Arab history. The Turkish agents complied with the infamous proposal of Seyyid Talib. Saadun was invited to the latter’s house, the well-known Beit el-Naqib, accepted the invitation without suspicion, and duly appeared. By arrangement of Seyyid Talib, Saadun was to sleep secure for the night, and was to be invited next morning to a repast whileSeyyid Talib was to excuse himself on the plea that he had business in the harem. When Saadun had eaten, the Turkish agents sent men in the guise of emissaries of the Wali to invite him to appear before the Wali at the Serai. The plan was successfully carried out. Saadun left Beit el-Naqib with the supposed emissaries of the Wali. When, however, they reached the Serai, they were told that the Wali had gone to Ashar. Saadun still unsuspecting was taken to Ashar in a bellam and from there straight to a Turkish gunboat where he was informed he was a prisoner. The boat left quietly in the night, and on his arrival at Baghdad Saadun was taken to Aleppo where he remained a prisoner and ultimately died. From the time of Seyyid Talib’s signal act of duplicity, the great Muntafiq chief passes out of history, and his place is taken by his second son, Ajaimi. Ajaimi was at this time besieged by the Budur in a fort north-west of Nasiriyah, at Maiyah. The Turkish agents secured his release and let him go. He fled to the Ghazzi, but the Sheikh of the Ghazzi, Ibn Hubiyib, was not prepared to take on his shoulders the onus of protecting this restless spirit, and Aiaimi was compelled to seek protection elsewhere. Isolated but not despairing:, he mounted his dheiul, rode almost alone to Hail and knelt Ids camel before the great Emir. “ I claim your protection, 0 Emir,” he said, “and your help to avenge me on my enemies. This you owe me as a right; for it was while he was under vour protection,, that my father, Saadun, was set upon and defeated by the Dhafir.” At Hail he stayed for some time, until at length Ibn Rashid consented to help him to attack the Dhafir. Aiaimi went to call in the help of the Juwarm. Ibn Rashid, on the first occasion he met the enemy, fled and brought in the help of Dhari ibn Tawala and the Aslam. _ Then he returned to the fight, and attacked and deEeated a combmed todj, of Dhafir and Budur between Shagrah and Abu Ghar Ajai arrived one day late. Ibn Rashid returned to Hail and left the Muteir, whom he had also called to his help, as a protection to Aiaimi. . This was in the.spring of 1913 Hext winter the Dhafir and the Budur returned from their summer quarters north and west of Nasiriyah. Ajaimi was still able to call in e Muteir but, fearing he was not strong enough to repel attacks, he appealed to the Muntafiq sympathies of sections of *e Beni W.,lit mid drew a body of them to his side. Ihe opposing forces met somewhere between Shagrah and Arkham.eh ; but w t, met the Budur had entered into secret negotiations with the Beni Malik ; for the Budur, too, are a Muntafiq tribe. The Beni Malik either fled or offered only a weak resistance with the result that Ajaimi and the Muteir were routed and and animals were captured. Ajaimi ned with ^ Gir a r to Safwan where he remained until the summer. ^“^1 rmnoved trSkbashiyah, where he perpetrated a futhfess act rf robbery upon aii unoffending relation.

Always generous with his money, whatever ts source, he was able, with the sum robbed from Mafvad to attract a baud of 400 mercenaries from various directions His force consisted of some Muteir, some Shammar some Beni Malik and other miscellaneous mercenaries. V. h th”se lie invaded the Dhafir district, and brought up against the Dhafir and the Budar at Naba. Then ensued one of the bloodiest fights in the history of tribal warfare in the Sham,yah desert. The Dhafir and Budur inflicted a severe defeat on Aiaimi and his following, and are said to have killed nearly 300 of them, their own losses being forty killed. The following day, Mazyad, overjoyed at the result, mounted his horse and galloped and curvetted before the victorious Arabs. This incongruous act met with disfavour in the eyes of Nemesis, and the unfortunate old man—he was then eight) fell and Ajaimi was now at the end of his resources, arid was reduced to making peace with his enemies. Hence he invited Hamud Ibn Suweit, chief of the Dhafir, to join up with him near Chabdah. Hamud consented, and settled alongside of him with some fifty tents. The rest of the Dhafir repudiated his overtures. Whether Ajaimi originally meditated treachery, or was driven to what he did by the unfriendliness of the rest of the Dhafir, it is difficult to say. At any rate, he quietly sent word to the Muteir, acquainting them with this splendid opportunity of revenge. The Muteir arrived, all out for a raid. Hamud Ibn Suweit protested to Ajaimi against this gross act of treachery, and Ajaimi repenting, attempted to dissuade the Muteir. But the Muteir were inexorable. They had come for a raid or a fight at Ajaimi’s express invitation, and were determined to carry it out. Ajaimi had to submit to his own arrangement, and reverted to his original intention of calling up the Muteir. “ Qalab ala Ibn Suweit,” as the Arabs say—it turned round against him. Hamud and his fifty tents fell an easy prey to the Muteir, and this affair is since known as the Qalbah. A speedy revenge overtook Ajaimi. News of the event soon reached the Budur, ancient friends of the Dhafir and their refuge in time of trouble, and two months after the Qalbah, the Dhafir and the Budur defeated Ajaimi at Shagrah. As the fiercest of Arab fights cannot permanently weaken a tribe,inasmuch as prisoners are normally released and live to fight again another day, there was no hope that Ajaimi was put out o£ court for good and all. So little depressed was he by his late defeat, that not more than two months later he engineered a raid by Ibn Rashid on the Arail section of the Dhafir at Tugayyid, while he himself and the Muteir defeated the Suweit section at El-Qusair. Meanwhile, greater events than any tribal dissensions were looming over Arabia. Turkey had declared war on Great Britain, and the Turks, who were joined by Ajaimi with 250 sowars, were gradually driven from Fao and Basrah. But other events, not of such significance to the world at large, though of greater purport to the Jezirat el-Arab, began to develop—-events which introduce us to elements and dissensions not within the scope of this account, which concerns chiefly the Shamiyah desert. But it will be useful to describe one great struggle, so as to explain certain elements whieh can never be altogether out of relation with the Shamiyah. This is a famous fight between Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid. The events -which led up to it are somewhat as follows. Ibn Saud delivered an ultimatum to the Muteir, who are really one of Ids own tribes, though they had of late joined Ibn Rashi or Ajaimi indifferently, when these offered occasions for plunder. He demanded their return to his suzerainty on pam of permanent hostility The Muteir were willing to return to their old allegiance, and celebrated their decision by pilfering a caravan ot 1,000 camels, which was on its way from Zubeir to the followers of Ibn Tawala, chief of the Aslam section of the Shammar. They were then ready to return to their own country and pm forces with Ibn Saud. At the beginning of their war with Great Britain the Turks had tried to persuade Ibn Rashid to attad an Saud in force. Ibr, Kashid, -‘hing o,h co lected his forces Meanwhile, the Turks changed then mmds. It occurred to them that if they could persuade Ibn Rashid to keep his forces in the Iraq, and Ibn Saud to attack KoweR they would at the same time completely overawe the Arabs of the Iraq an overthrow a great stronghold of British influence It was overtnrow S cal”upon the notonous Seyyid iahb to according y . 11 c i . , induce him to co-operate, proceed °n a mission to ^Sa^dyo^nbuce ^ ^ his At that moment ^ &gt;7 and whil e he was still hesitating services on extava an j declaration of war precipitated to abate his demands tne su ^ ous sitllation&gt; from which matters and placed him d o providential means of the placed himself into com- muXation with ke” British authorities, and was allowed to proceed to India via Koweit. . , Meanwhile, wh.n SiijSta sSi &gt;' l 1 ' I*™ 0,w — 94 — r* Ur Pnlifiral Ao'ent at Koweit, who H.

Adherents of either side naturally give very different versions of what occurred, but there is no doubt that while both parties suffered severely from the shock of the encounter ami from the depredations of the Ajtnan and other marauders aftet it Ibn Saud was the hardest hit and was for the time crippled. It was in the course of this action that Captain Shakespear, who insisted on being present as an interested spectator, though pressed by his friend and host to remain at a distance, met his lamented and untimely end. No two accounts give the same version of the precise circumstances of his death, and until the clouds of war have passed over and reliable sources from both sides can be reached under conditions of peace, it is hardly possible that they can be ascertained with certainty. But to return to the fight. The Muteir were some distance away when the fight began. W hen they drew near and heard the sound of shots, they worked round the fight to the south and finally came up right behind the Shammar to where they had left their camels. These they seized and made off with and secured large booty. They then returned to their own country and to the defeated Ibn Saud said : u Why did you fly ? See, we have captured the very dhelui of Ibn Rashid himself. As indeed they had. But nothing could compensate for the reversal of fortune caused by the treachery of the Ajman. And to this day Ibn Saud cherishes the hope of wiping them out to a man. Only their repute as fighting men—and it is often said there are no Arabs their equals—has preserved them from extinction. For they have many enemies and no friends.Arabs themselves say that of Bedouins the stoutest fighters are the Ajman, and of the Muntafiq the Budur. The Shammar too are redoubtable, as are the Zayyad, who occasionally appear to the help of the Dhafir. Less reputable fighters, though famous raiders, are the Muteir and the Dhafir. There is no tribe to touch the Dhafir for what seems to ns mere thieving, though it is dignified by the Prophet under the name of a raid. It will be noticed in this brief history of tribal dissensions that the Budur have continually saved the Dhafir from disaster. And indeed the Dhafir owe everything to the Budur. Certain tribes like tie Azairii are distinguished fighters on their own ground but helpless far afield. It is not so with the Budur. At home or abroad they display the same consistency of valour and they have a quality almost peculiar to them, the quality of always rallying to the standard of their head chief m the face of a common enemy, notwithstanding their internal quarrelsomeness and a certain rep - tation for ruffianism. It is different with another similar tribe, the Juwar'm, who certainly at the present time find no c i round whom they will readily rally at need, bo with the Zavvad- brave enough as fighters, they are split up into so many ill-united sections that one cannot conceive them rallying to one standard. Most o£ the Shamiyah tribes have taken par on one or other o£ the many raids and fights recorded m us V,Dhafir Budur, Juwarm, Ghazzi, Zayyad. But the pro tae-onhits are the Dhafir and the Budur. It is a curious alliance, Bedouin and camel tribe with Muntafiq and donkey tribe, orig^natm^in a blood feud against a common enemy, Ajaimi.

Koweit. Details about the death of Sheikh Jab.r and the accession of Sheikh Salim have been sent by Basrah, under date, February 17. It appears that for some days before January 28, Jabir had been suffering from gastric fever, for winch two European doctors were attending him After a brief rahy lie grew worse, and native doctors replaced the Europeans. He was cupped and bled on February 3, but died on the oth. His brother, Salim, succeeded without any disturbance m the town, the suq keeping open as usual. Salim is about fifty-five. Sir Percy Cox gives him a better character than our earlier information led us to credit. He was always a stronger man than his elder brother, and had more influence with tribesmen, partly through havmg been brought up in Bedouin fashion. Had he been in Koweit at the moment of Mubarak’s death, he might have succeeded instead of Jabir, who, as governor of the town, was on the spot 5 but, on his return from the desert, Salim accepted his brother and helped him loyally. His reputation for chauvinism and bigotry has not been confirmed by anything he has done during his brother’s reign, and both at the Koweit°Durbar last November and on his accession, he has identified himself with our interests. It is expected, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government will confirm his succession. Bahrein and Hasa. Nothing of moment is reported from here. The population seems to have recovered from the crisis in the Pearl trade, and to have resumed fishing as usual. Oman. We hear only that the Sultan sent a congratulatory message as usual to the Political Resident at the New Year. We conclude that the interior remains in its normal state of quiescent rebellion. Hejaz. Intelligence. There is little to record in the way of operations since our last issue. The Turks have evacuated Ghayir, Sath el-Ghayir, and Khanaqat er-Rim, i.e., all their advanced posts on the Gaha road ; but they still hold Mijz, which thev have strongly entrenched, on the Fura road. As, however, they have with drawn their reserve rations from the latter to Bir el-Mashi it looks as if they contemplated further retirement. On the Sultani road they have given up Bir Derwish and established Headquarters at Bir Wuhub or Bir Sheriufi, their retreat being an led by the Rahalah Harb, who are said to have lifted 150 of their camels.Our planes seem to have exploded something at Sath el-Grhayir, which was probably an ammunition dump, and, flying to Ali’s camp on February 4, they opportunely met and chased back an enemy plane. At Medina we hear that the explosion at the Bab Kubah barracks, which were full of Takruri soldiers, did much damage and caused a panic in the town. Roads from Hail are completely closed and scarcity increases, the actual bread ration being only about three-fifths of the reduced weight decreed by Jemal Pasha. Exodus of the civil population and government officials continues, the Turks having offered the inhabitants the choice of Mecca, Yambo or Syria, with (in the last alternative) transport by rail. Since, however, on the night of February 20, a train going north was blown up and derailed between Mudurij and Toweira, this facility has been mtenupted, for a time, at any rate. It appears that in the fight at Nakhl Mubarak in December the Turks lost heavily, the shrapnel of Arab 15-pounders having proved very effective. A considerable part of the Hejaz Expeditionary I orce, with its ouns, has been withdrawn northwards now, and is probably detailed along the railway. According to one report, not more than six battalions are left in the Medina district. Ihe mam concentration is now at Medain Salih, where the first battalion of the 163rd Regiment has appeared as a reinforcement, while the third is at El-Ala : the second and fourth are expected. Ihe line is now regularly patrolled by trolleys between stations. Feisal and Abdullah are holding the five principal passes from the coast to the railway, viz., Bowat, Murabba (m Wadi Ais), Kharar and Ras el-Yejd on the two inland routes from Weih and Khoreitah on the Dhaba—Tebuk road. The Circassian cavalry, which was holding Khoreitah, has been driven out by the Huweitat. Altogether the Huweitat have accounted for about 100 Turks, killed and prisoners.

During the month of January constant reports were received that Sevvid Ahmed was meditating a withdrawal from Siwa to the west 7 A copy of a letter from him to Seyyid Mohammed Idris was sent by the latter to the High Commissioner of Egypt, in which Seyyid Ahmed said that he was prepared to withdraw from Siwa m deference to Mohammed Idris’ wishes, but was unable to do so unless he could obtain 500 camels. It thus appeared almost certain that any force of ours, for which even a short period of concentration would be required, would not arrive in time to strike a blow at the remnants of the Senussi forces with Seyyid Ahmed. It was accordingly decided to employ the light armoured cars (Rolls-Royce : three batteries of four cars each), and three light cars patrols (six Ford cars each). The supplies of this column were carried by heavy motor lorries to Bayud, a distance of eighty-five miles from the base, the transport thence onward being by light Ford vans. The plan was to make for Girba, where the main body was reported to be, placing one battery of L.A.C. and one L.C.P. at a pass on the road to Jaghbub, some sixteen miles west of Girba, with a view to cutting olf any of the force which might be driven out of Girba by our main body. The column left Matruh at dawn on February 1, and arrived at the point of concentration some fifteen miles north of the Girba escarpment on the following day at noon. As information had been received that the road into Girba had been mined, a fresh pass was reconnoitred, and on the following morning at dawn our force moved off, and, successfuly descending by the new pass, pushed into the oasis, where it found the Senussi force, numbering about 800, holding a very strong position at the foot of the escarpment on the S.W. side of the oasis. Two mountain guns and two machine-guns were at once brought into action by the enemy, and the armoured cars were subjected to a heavy and accurate fire. Owing to the nature of the ground it was not possible for the cars to come to closer range than 600-800 yards. The action lasted some twenty hours, and before dawn on the morning of February 4 the enemy hastily decamped, leaving some fifty dead behind. l eav ing, this force took a southerly direction into the sand-dunes, turning north again to strike the Jaghbub road at the pass (Munasib), where the detached L.A.C.B. and L.C.P.were waiting to intercept them. After suffering some loss here the retreating enemy again turned southwards into the sand-dune country, through which the rest of his journey to Jaghbub must have been attended with the greatest difficulties. From information received it appears that the enemy casualties in wounded alone must have been not less than 200, including six Turkish officers. It was only the nature ol the ground, rendering pursuit from Girba and movement m any direction from Munasib impossible, which saved the entire enemy force from being completely wiped out. At tbe beginning o£ the action Seyyid Ahmedf who was in Siwa with Mohammed Salih at once fled (in accordance with his usual P^tme) “to the sand-dunes south o£ Siwa, and made oft .p, th ®.f warned of the presence of our post at Munasib, he did not attempt to break through there and turned off into the sand-dunes south.

The following extracts from this intercepted letter are of particular interest, as showing the effect which the bhenfial rising at the present moment has on the former s mind “ Sir look at the Sherif Husein, Emir of Mecca, who was made by the Turks. He saw that his interest and the interest of his country required him to go against them. He proclaimed his independence, and asked the approval of the Allied Govern ments (which he obtained), and now he is the King of the Arabs He is now arranging his Government, such as the torm- ation of Cabinets and other things. If he had entered the war with the Turks, the Allies would have been occupying his country as they now occupy Basrah and other towns. He pro claimed everywhere and to the papers that his actions are not against Islam, but against the Unionist I arty. He still preaches in the name of the Khalifa, but the Khalifa is at a loss what to do. The Arabs wanted to safeguard their honour from the Union and Progress Party. They have proclaimed him king. “ How can the Turks enter Egypt after they have failed to retake Hejaz ? After being near the Canal, they have to-day retired from El-Arish, and the English have occupied Rafa, and are striking at the Hejaz railway to cut it, as those who can read maps will inform you if you do not know. Don’t you see the Seyyid Idris of the Yemen who is still independent and did not commit himself, though the English tried to persuade him to fight the Government (Turks) ? The Government tried to incite him against the English, but he refused. You might have done like him before the affair of Solium. The Government and the English were in your hand. Regret is now useless. I draw your attention to the Islamic world, which desires to know you. You must look for what is to our advantage and that of our country, so that we may not be sacrificed for others.” Western Desert. Our rough handling of the Siwa soldiers at Girba is expected to have driven them all to Jaghbub, and probably on to Jalo; they had large numbers of sick, and their journey was undertaken before their preparations were complete, so that their march is likely to be attended with considerable casualties before they reach Jaghbub. This place is not considered able to support an army, in which case there remains before the latter the difficult march to Jalo for which a six days’ water supply has to be carried.Cyrenaica. At Akroma, Mohammed Idris is busy obtaining the views o£ all parties ; he has received two Turkish officers from Nuri, and is asking for two delegates from each tribe to consult with him. There is great misery, because the blockade leads to frequent cattle-raids amongst the various tribes. The immediate prospects of food are also bad, since, owing to insufficient rainfall, much less barley was sown than usual, and a poor crop is expected. A caravan, with ivory and ostrich feathers from Kufra, arrived at Benghazi, and others are coming from Jalo, showing an expectation of trade being resumed. Tripoli. Two distinct campaigns are being prepared in Tripoli. In the east the Tarhuna appear to be joining forces with the Senussi in order to crush Ramadan Shitewi, who is doing all in his power to collect an army. Two thousand Senussi, with three guns, were reported to have left Cyrenaica for Sert, and a simultaneous attack may be made on Shitewi from north and south. In Northern Tripoli, Bar uni’s forces are anxious to avenge their defeat at Agelat (east of Zuara), where the Italian force, which consisted of Erythreans and Somalis, lays claim to 820 killed and 1,200 wounded, whereas its own losses were light. Baruni admits heavy losses, but is anxious to organize attacks on Nuail and Zuara, saying that no help can be expected from Turkey till Zuara is taken. Baruni has among his following: Sheikh Sof, Mahdi el-Sunni, Mohammed Pighenq Khalifa ben Askar, Mohammed el-Shellabi, Abeda ben Zikri and Zaki el-Maghegh, and their forces at the battle of Agelat were rather over 4,000. They would, therefore, seem to have lost about half their effectives. NOTES. Asir Tribes. Two Turkish officers, both natives of north-east Asia Minor (one is a Laz, the other an Erzinjian Kurd), who had been recalled to Damascus from Ebhah last spring, were made prisoners en route at Mecca by the Emir, in June, 1916 They have been examined in Cairo, and state, that up to the date of their departure, no Asir tribes had risen against the Turks except the Ghamid, the Zahran, the Qahtan, the Sabia group, (Idnsi s home tribes) and the Rijal el-Ma. The last named, who called out eight to ten thousand men, and occupied strong positmns were easily reduced by a Turkish force of from l,o00 to 2,000 men, bribery being used as an auxiliary arm. One of our informants, who was O.C. 122nd Regiment, himself commanded the expedi- tionarv force. Idris was regarded at that time as threatening very little danger, his tribal following having been much reduced.— 102 — All roads to Mohail and Qunfudah were then open and Aii rudua ^ -..p pas ilv. The latter town these Ebhah obtained supplies q } , suburbs included officers estimate to contain about 400 houses, suburbs included. They travelled thence to Mecca m fifteen days They confirm our belief that the Abdul Aziz .bn Ham,d who was reported some time ago to be leading a force of As,r r.besmen nord. ward to ioin the King of the Hejaz, ,s the bhahran chief of the Misheit house. He is about sixty years of age a good Turk- hater, and a friend of King Huse.n, but he ,s said to t.pple. Our informants regard the Ghamid and Zahran as^ independent tribes, owing allegiance to no one, whether he be Turk, Idris or TTmii* nf \T prra. The C.U.P-, the Sheikh el-lslam, and the Efkaf. The French Ministry at Berne reports that, at the C.U.P. Congress held at Constantinople last October under the presi dency of the Grand Vezier and Talaat, it was reported that the Sheikh el-lslam had been relieved of practically all his temporal duties, e.g. his guardianship of orphans, control of schools, and executive functions in regard to sentences passed by the Sheria Courts. These courts are in future to be under the Ministry of Justice, while the primary schools, hitherto maintained by the Efkaf, are to be transferred to the Ministry of Public Instruc tion, together with the special funds allotted to them. To preclude any agitation which might be caused among the ulema by this measure, most members of that body had been removed from Constantinople previously to its promulgation. This step has been taken, in the opinion of the French Minister, as a result of the notorious disaffection of the ulema and in anticipation of an assumption of the Caliphate by the King of the Hejaz. In the latter eventuality, the C.U.P. is not sure of the attitude of the ulema, and, therefore, wishes to reduce their power and influence in good time. [Note by Arab Bureau. —In any case, this measure marks a definite resumption of the C.U.P.’s original secularizing programme, intermitted in 1909. The Neo-Turanian movement has strengthened its hands since then. We doubt if any con sideration of the Caliphate has really influenced the C.U.P. in this connection.] Euphrates Intelligence. Late in December last Ajaimi Saadun was said to have been greatly shaken in his pro-Turk policy by two things, first, the news of the Turkish successes at Hillah, and second, Ibn Baud’s letter urging him to break with the Turks and Ibn Rashid. With the last he is said to be, in any case, not on cordial terms at .present. His brother, Dhamir, who is pro-British, seems to expect that Ajaimi may ultimately change sides. Rashid Ibn Lailah’s mission to Hail, undertaken for the Turks who had become alarmed at the continued success ofthe Sherifs revolt, was a fiasco as he found no tribesmen collected at Hail. He then went to Nejef to buy horses and provisions for Ibn Rashid, but the tribesmen would not let these pass south. He is said to be still waiting near Nejef. [Later report says he has reached Hail.] Ibn Ajil, Chief of the Abdah Sham mar, was reported on January 12, to have left Ajaimi and to be about to join Ibn Rashid. [Later report says he has gone to Ajfah, between Hail and Shaibah, where Ibn Rashid is expected.] Wejh Papers. Military papers, captured at Wejh in January, and read in Cairo, confirm our intelligence about a progressive reduction of Turkish food rations in the last months of 1916. Jemal, O.C. IVth A.C., ordered the bread ration to be reduced to two-thirds on November 15, and to one-half on December 2. On December 15, he issued a general corps order fixing the ration at 400 grammes. The commandant of Wejh complained frequently, and with growing insistence, to the Military Governor of Medina about the shortage of bread, other foodstuffs, and forage ; also ot the state of his men’s clothing, and of the arrears into which pay to volunteers, and subsidies to sheikhs and tribesmen had fallen He showed great solicitude about both Suleiman Rutadah and other Billi chiefs, and also Saad el-Ghaneim, of the Musa Juhemah. The last he continued to regard as loyal up to autumn, 1916. He mentions the pillaging by Rifaa Juheinah, near Yambo, of the boat which contained Stotzingen’s baggage ; the latter s Indian servant, Mohammed Effendi, lost L.T. 8o m that affair.

(^) Eshref Bey’s Capture.— 107 SYRIA. The Raw Material. [Fragmentary notes written early in 1915, but not circulated.] Geographically, Syria is much parcelled out. The first and greatest longitudinal division is made by the mountains, which run like a rugged spine north and south close to the sea, and shut off the peoples of the coast from those of the interior. Those of the coast speak a different Arabic, differently intoned ; they live in different houses, eat different food, and gain their living differently. They speak of the “ interior ” unwillingly, as a wild land full of blood and terror. The interior is divided again longitudinally. The peasants in the valleys of the Jordan, Litani and Orontes are the most stable, most prosperous yeomen of the country; and beyond them is the strange shifting population of the border lands, wavering eastward or westward with the season, living by their wits onlv, wasted by droughts and locusts, by Bedouin raids, and if these fail them, by their own incurable blood-feuds. Each of these main north and south strip-divisions is crossed and walled off into compartments mutually at odds : and it is necessary, if political composition of Syria is to be gauged, to enumerate some of the heads of these. The boundary between Arab and Turkish speech follows, not inaptly, the' coach-road from Alexandretta to Ezaz, and thence the Baghdad railway to Jerablus. On the west it begins among Ansariya, disciples of a strange cult o a P I ' in ^ 1 P e of fertility, slier pagan, anti-foreign, distrustful of Moham medanism, but drawn for the moment to Christianity y e attraction of common persecution ; the sect is very vital m itself, and as clannish in feeling and politics as a sect cai . One Nosairi will not betray another, and they will hardly not betray Mohammedan and Christian. ^Their vihages are sown in patches down the main hills from Missis ^ Thev Tripoli gap, and their sheikhs are Aissa and old Maaruf i y sneak 1 Arabic only, and they have lived there since, at least, the beginning of Greek history. They stand aside from po l icy and leave the Turkish Government alone m ^° s ^ Mixed among the Ansariya are colonies of Syrian Chnstia and south of the Orontes are (or were) solid blocks ot Armenians who spoke Turkish, but would not consort with t P Inland south of Harim, are settlements of Druses (who fu’e r Arabs) ^and ^Circassians. these have their hand agamst North east of them are Kurds, speaking Kurdish every man. No • generations back, who are marrying and Arabic, settlers ot some gei . &lt; Christians At t cr ..a i-— 108 — and Jews unite to spit upon the Yezid After the Yezidis lies A eono a town of a quarter of a million of people and an epitome of all races and religions. Eastward of Aleppo for sixty miles you pass through settled Arabs, whose colour and manner becomes more and more tribal as you approach the fringe of cultivation, where the semi-nomad ends and the Bedawi begins. If you take another section across Syria, a degree more to 'the south you begin with some colonies of Mohammedan Circassians near the sea. They speak Arabic now and are an ingenious but quarrelsome race, much opposed by their Arab neighbours Inland of them are districts reserved for Ismaihya. These speak Arabic, and worship among themselves a king Mohammed, who, in the flesh, is the Agha Khan. I hey believe him to be a great and wonderful sovereign, honouring the English with his protection. They hate Arabs and orthodox Mushmin, and look for the crumbling of the Turk. Meanwhile, they are loathed and trampled on by their neighbours, and are driven to conceal their beastly opinions under a veneer of orthodoxy. Everyone knows how thin that is, and they maintain among themselves signs and pass-words by which they know one another. Miserably poor in appearance, they pay the Agha a princely tribute every year. Beyond the Ismailiya is a strange sight, villages of Christian tribal Arabs, some of semi-nomad habits, under their own sheikhs. Very sturdy Christians they are, most unlike their snivelling brethren in the hills. They live as do the Sunnis round them, dress like them, speak like them, and are on the best of terms with them. East of these Christians are semi-nomad Muslim peasants, and east of them again some villages of Ismailiya outcasts, on the extreme' edge of cultivation, whither they have retired in search of comparative peace. Beyond them only Bedouins. Take another section through Syria, a degree lower down, between Tripoli and Beyrout. To begin with, near the coast, are Lebanon Christians, Maronites and Greeks for the most part. It is hard to disentangle the politics of the two churches. Superficially, one should be French and the other Russian, but a part of the Maronites now have been in the United States, and have developed there an Anglo-Saxon vein which is not the less vigorous for being spurious. The Greek ehurch prides itself on being old Syrian, autocthonous, of an intense local patriotism that (with part) would rather fling it into the arms of the Turk than endure irretrievable annexation by a Roman power. r I he adherents of the two churches are at one in unmeasured slander of Mohammedans and their religion. They salve a consciousness of inbred inferiority by this verbal scorn. Behind and among the Christians live families of Mohammedan Sunnis, Arabic-speaking, identical in race and habit with the Christian, marked off from them by a less mincing dialect, and a distaste for emigration and its results. On the higher slopes of the hills are serried settlements of Metawala, Shia Moham medans who came from Persia centuries ago. They are dirty,ignorant, surly, and fanatical. They will not eat or drink with an infidel (the Sunni as bad as the Christian), follow their own priests and notables, speak Arabic but disown in every way the people, not their co-sectarians, who live about them. Across the hills are villages of Christians, yeomen, living at peace with their Sunni neighbours, as though they had never heard the grumbles of their fellows in the Lebanon. East of them are semi-nomad Arab peasantry. Take a section a degree lower down, near Acre. There are first, Sunni Arabs, then Druses, then Metawala to the Jordan valley, near which are many bitterly-suspicious Algerian colomes, mixed in with villages of aboriginal Palestinian Jews Ihe latter are an interesting race. They speak Arabic and good Hebrew : have developed a standard and style of living suitable to the country, and yet much better than the manner of the Arabs. They cultivate the land, and hide their lights rather under bushels, since their example would be a great one for the foreign (German inspired) colonies of agricultural Jews, w 10 introduce strange manners of cultivation and crops, and European houses (erected out of pious subscriptions), to a country like Palestine, at once too small and too poor to repay efforts on such a scale The Jewish colonies of North Palestine pay their way perhaps but give no proportionate return on their capital expenditure. They are, however, honest in their attempts at colonization, and dLrve honour, in comparison with the l^er settlements of sentimental remittance-men m South Palest . Locallv they are more than tolerated ; one does not find round Galilee ’the deep-seated antipathy to Jewish colonists and a^ms that is such an unlovely feature of the Jeru^lem area Across the Eastern plain (Arabs), you come to the Leja, a ^byrinth crackled lava, where all the loose and broken men of |y™Jury foregathered for unnumbered generations.

Among- them, and east of them, are semi-nomad and nomad Arabs of the religion of the desert, living on the fear and bounty of their Christian neighbours. Down this debateable land the Ottoman Government has planted a long line of Circassian immigrants. They hold their ground only by the sword and the favour of the Turks, to whom they are consequently devoted. These odd races and religions do not complete the tale of the races of Syria. There are still the six great towns, Jerusalem, Beyrout, Damascus, Hama, Homs, and Aleppo to be reckoned apart from the country folk in any accounting of Syria. Jerusalem is a dirty town which all Semitic religions have made holy. Christians and Mohammedans come there on pilgrimage; Jews look to it for the political future of their race. In it the united forces of the past are so strong that the city fails to have a present : its people, with the rarest exceptions, are characterless as hotel servants, living on the crowd of visitors passing through. Questions of Arabs and their nation ality are as far from them as bimetallism from the life of Texas, though familiarity with the differences among Christians in their moment of most fervent expression has led tbe Mohammedans of Jerusalem to despise (and dislike) foreigners generally. Beyrout is altogether new. It would be all bastard French in feeling, as in language, but for its Greek harbour and its American college. Public opinion in it is that of the Christian merchants, all fat men, who live by exchange, for Beyrout itself produces nothing. After the merchants its strongest component is the class of returned emigrants, living on their invested savings, in the town of Syria which, to them, most resembles the Washington Avenue where they “made good.” Beyrout is the door of Syria, with a Levantine screen through which shop-soiled foreign influences flow into Syria. It is as representative of Syria as Soho of the Home Counties, and yet in Beyrout, from its geographical position, from its schools, from the freedom engendered by inter course with many foreigners, there was a nucleus of people, Mohammedans, talking and writing and thinking like the doctrinaire cyclopasdists who paved the way for revolution in France, and whose words permeated to parts of the interior where action is in favour. For their sake (many of them are martyrs now, in Arab eyes) and, for the power of its wealth, and for its exceeding loud and ready voice, Beyrout is to be reckoned with. Damascus, Homs, Hamah, and Aleppo are the four ancient uties in which Syria takes pride. They are stretched like achain along the fertile valleys of the interior, between the desert and the hills ; because of their setting they turn their backs upon the sea and look eastward. They are Arab and know themselves such. Damascus is the old inevitable head of Syria. It is the seat of lay government and the religious centre, three days only from the Holy City by its railway. Its sheikhs are leaders of opinion, and more “ Meccan ” than others elsewhere. Its people are fresh and turbulent, always willing to strike, as extreme in their words and acts as in their pleasures. Damascus will move before any part of Syria. The Turks made it their militarv centre, just as naturally as the Arab Opposition, or Oppenheim and Sheikh Shawish established themselves there. Damascus is a lodestar to which Arabs are naturally drawn, and a city which will not easily be convinced that it is subject to any alien race. Hamah and Homs are towns which dislike one another. Everyone in them manufactures things—in Homs, generally cotton and wool, in Hamah, silk and brocade. Their industries were prosperous and increasing ; their merchants were quick to take advantage of new outlets, or to meet new tastes. _ North Africa, the Balkans, Syria, Arabia, Mesopotamia used their stutts They demonstrated the productive ability of Syria, unguided by foreigners, as Beyrout demonstrated its understanding ot commerce. Yet, while the prosperity of Beyrout has made it Levantine, the prosperity of Homs and Hamah has reinforced their localism, made them more entirely native, and more jealously native than any other Syrian towns. It almost seems as though familiarity with plant and power had shown the people there that the manners of their fathers were the best. Aleppo is the largest city in Syria, but not of it, nor of Turkey nor of Mesopotamia. Bather it is a point where all races, creeds and tongues of the Ottoman Empire meet and know one another in a spirit of compromise. The clash of varied characteristics, which makes its streets a kaleidoscope, has imbued in the Aleppine a kind of thoughtfulness, winch corrects in him what is wanton in the Damascene. Aleppo has shared in eac of the civilizations which turn about it and the resul seems to be a lack of zest in all that its people do. Even so, they smpa the re t of Syria in most things. They fight and trade more are more fanatical and vicious, and make most beautiful hinge, but al, with a dearth of conviction ^t -nde^ ,e,i-^ Christian and Mohammedaig Armenia^ Arab, Km^k ^ iess ^ce is accorded— 112 — outskirts like overgrown, half-nomad villages. These are, after the Maidan of Damascus, the most national of any parts of towns, and the intensity of their Arab feeling tinges the rest of the citizens with a colour of nationalism, which is by so much less vivid than the unanimous opinion of In the creeds and races above described, and in others not enumerated, lie the raw materials of Syria for a statesman. It will be noted that the distinctions are political or religious; morally the peoples somewhat resemble one another, with a steady gradation from neurotic sensibility, on the coast, to reserve, inland. They are quick-minded, admirers (but not seekers) of truth, ’ self-satisfied, not incapable (as are the Egyptians) of abstract ideas, but unpractical, and so lazy mentally as to be superficial. Their wish is to be left alone to busy themselves with others’ affairs. From childhood they are lawless, obeying their fathers only as long as they fear to be beaten, and their government later for the same reason : yet there are few races with a greater respect than the upland Syrian for customary law. All of them want something new, for with their superficiality and their lawlessness is combined a passion for politics, the science of which it is fatally easy for the Syrian to gain a smattering, and too difficult to gain a mastery. They are all discontented with the government they have, but few of them honestly combine their ideas of what they want. Some (mostly Mohammedans) cry for an Arab kingdom, some (mostly Christians) for a foreign protection of an altruistic thelemic order, conferring privileges without obligation. Others cry for auto nomy for Syria. Autonomy is a comprehensible word, Syria is not, for the words Syria and Syrian are foreign terms. Unless he has learnt English or French, the inhabitant of these parts has no word to describe all his country. Syria in Turkish (the word exists not in Arabic) is the province of Damascus. Sham in Arabic is the town of Damascus. An Aleppine always calls himself an Aleppine, a Beyrouti a Beyrouti, and so down to the smallest villages. This verbal poverty indicates a political condition. There is no national feeling. Between town and town, village and village, family and family, creed and creed, exist intimate jealousies, sedulously fostered by the lurks to render a spontaneous union impossible. The largest indigenous political entity in settled oyiia is only the village under its sheikh, and in patriarchal ^vyria the tribe under its chief. These leaders are chosen, not oimally, but by opinion from the entitled families, and they rule by custom and consent. All the constitution above them is the aiti cia bureaucracy of the Turk, maintained by force, impossible i it were to be carried out according to its paper scheme, but in practice either fairly good or very bad, according to the less or greater trailty of the human instruments through which it works.Time seems to have proclaimed that autonomous union is beyond the powers of such a people. In^ history, Syria is always the corridor between sea and desert, joining Africa to Asia, and Arabia to Europe. It has been a prize-ring for the great peoples lying about it, alternately the vassal of Asia Minor, Egypt, Greece, Home, Arabia or Mesopotamia, and v\ hen given a momentary independence by the weakness of its neighbours, it has at once resolved itself fiercely into Northern and Southern, Eastern and Western discordant “kingdoms,” with the areas and populations at best of Yorkshire, at worst of Rutland ; for if Syria is by nature a vassal country, it is also by habit a country of agitations and rebellions. The proposals to make Syria an Arab or foreign-protected country are, of course, far from the hearts of the “ autonomy party, but the conviction of their internal divisions and the evident signs that Syria’s neighbours are not going to be of the weak sort that enable it to snatch a momentary independence, have reconciled these parts to having sucli proposals constantly on their lips. * * * * By accident and time the Arabic language has gradually permeated the country, until it is now ^ most ^ “'l 0 ' e “ use • but this does not mean that Syria—any more than Egypt ? Arabian eountrv On the sea coast there is little, if any, Irlbiffc or Edition : on the desert edge there is much. Meed racially, there is perhaps something to be said for the suo-gestion—thrown in the teeth of geograp y an ec °“°. 1 “ 1 of putting the littoral under one goverment, and the mte under another. # * * * whatever the limits of future politics, it can hardly be i fi f bVp a European Government, an Arab Government contested that k E mor P r wou ld be an imposed one, as the in Syria, to clay o ’ Tbp &lt;dcmificant thing; is to former Arab Governments wer .

Any wide attempt at autonomy would end in a patched and parcelled thing an imposition on a people whose instincts for ever and ever have been for parochial home-rule. It is equally clear that the seething discontent which Syrians cherish with the present Turkish administration is common enough to render possible a fleeting general movement towards a new factor, if it appeared to- offer a chance realization of the ideals of centripetal nationalism preached by the Beyrout and Damascus cyclopaedists of the last two generations. Also, that only by the intrusion of a new factor, founded on some outward power or non-Syrian basis, can the dissident tendencies of the sects and peoples of Syria be reined in sufficiently to prevent destructive anarchy. The more loose, informal, inchoate this new government, the less will be the inevitable disillusionment following on its institution ; for the true ideal of Syria, apart from the minute but vociferous Christian element, is not an efficient administration, but the minimum of central power to ensure peace, and permit the unchecked development of customary law. Also, that the only imposed government that will find, in Moslem Syria, any really prepared groundwork or large body of adherents is a Sunni one, speaking Arabic, and pretending to revive the Abbassides or Ayubides. T. E. L. ARABIA. Hejaz. Intelligence. It was stated in our last issue that the withdrawal by the Turks of their reserve rations from Mijz, on the Fura road, to Bir el-Mashi, indicated that they intended a further retirement. This has now taken place. Sherif Zeid has reported that his advanced guard has occupied Gradir Rabugh, near Mijz, that the enemy is retreating and that Bir el-Mashi itself is being besieged by the Arabs. This was confirmed by an aeroplane reconnais sance on February 28, over Mijz, which appeared to be occupied by Zeid s forces, although no ground signal was shown. Owing to Zeid s failure to carry out instructions about a landing ground, a more extensive reconnaissance was however impossible. The landing ground referred to is probably at Abud, a few miles south of Alijz. It was partially cleared and a landing was made on February 19, the pilot and observer being given a good recep tion ^ Zeid and his Arabs. The airmen were informed that retugees were frequently arriving from Medina, which they had left owing to lack of provisions. Since then, Miiz itself seems to have been used as a landing-ground.A delegation of four notables from Medina arrived recently at Mecca and confirmed the report that the tomb of the Prophet had been pillaged. The “Kibla” states, with regard to this, that the Nazir of Wakfs himself came from Constantinople and took away with him all the money and treasures, valued at thirteen million piastres, with which the tomb had been enriched by gifts from Moslems, many of these having been there for centuries. The Meccan Government has issued a notice proclaiming Wejh open for commerce, on condition that all articles imported into or exported from it should pass through the Customs at Jiddah. The Government is prepared to facilitate consignments and to offer the necessary guarantees for their safety. Any goods, however, not passing through the Jiddah Customs are liable to confiscation. Aziz Bey el-Masri, whose admitted political aspirations suited neither the views of the King of the Hejaz nor of ourselves, has been removed from his command and has retired to his village in the Delta. In his place, as Minister of War, the King has ap pointed the Egyptian captain, Mahmud el-Kaisuni, formerly commandant of the garrison of Mecca. We were informed from Rabugh, under date February 25, that Sherif Ali had made the following pronouncement in reference to an aeroplane reconnaissance • of Medina itself. “ There is no objection to a plane flying oyer the environs of the city and taking photographs, provided it does not fly over the city itself, photograph it or drop bombs into it. In accordance with this permission, Major Ross made a flight with two planes on March 5, from the forward landing ground at Mijz (occupied by Sherif Ah about February to Medina, establishing on the way the fact that Bir el-Mashi, Bir Derwish, Bir Ali, and the roads connecting those points with Medina, were still held in force by the Turks. Near Medina the railway station (three miles west), was visited, and found to contain no engine, and only enough rolling stock to make up one short train. Four hangars were located as well as an aerodrome, and three enemy planes were seen in the air. Jebel Ohod was found strongly fortified. The population of Medina is reported by spies to be deeply disaffected towards the Turks, and ready to turn on them at the first opportunity. On February 19, a raiding party, sent o from Sherif Zeid’s advanced force at Mrjz, reached a point called, variously, el-Alaiun and el-Baitha, about four-and-a 1 a miles from Medina, and captured fifty camels and four n es, killing half-a-dozen Turkish soldiers. The force of about 4,600 men now marching up the Sultam road with Sherif Ali consists of 1,500 troops, trained under Aziz-e - Masri and now led by Syrian officers 1^500 Ba ^am (Zahran) ( P 1,500 Beni Saad, 800 Beladiyah, 400 Meccans 200 Bishawa, and 250 Ateibah Camel Corps.

From Sherifs Abdullah and Feisal come reports (confirmed by other intelligence) of at least seven successful raids on the Keiaz railway. The most northerly attacks, south of Dar el- Hamra and near Matalli station were carried out by one of Feisal’s detachments. These resulted in a troop tram being held up, one repair gang being captured, and one seriously knocked about. The line remained cut for at least forty-eight hours. Between Toweira and Mudurij, about 200 miles south of this, a raid was made which will be dealt with in detail m our next issue on the basis of Bimbashi Garland s report. South again of this, Abdullah reports several demolitions, the most im portant of which, resulting in the capture of the guard of twenty-two men at the Wadi Hamdh bridge, north of Abul Naim station, and the destruction of the bridge itself, has been C* ,3 /-vVi /'ay* orvn Yemen. /jetter from the Imam Yahya. The letter which follows has been received by Colonel Jacob. It is remarkable for the comparative friendliness of its tone, and it argues that the Imam, who has said previously that he could never desert the Turks, is hedging. The motive prob ably is trouble with Zeidi tribesmen and merchants over the continued stoppage of trade. Disturbances continue at Radaa, Ibh and Qatabah, and uneasiness about the state of Yemen is said to be increasing at Lahej. ♦ “ Praise be to God the Compassionate and the Merciful. “ Seal of Imam Yahya bin Hamid ed-Din. “Dated Rabi Awal 8, 1335. x “ (i.e. December 1, 1916.) “ From “Imam Yahya bin Mohammed Hamid ed-Din of Yemen. “ To “ Colonel Jacob, “ Political Resident, Aden. “ A.C. “ We have received your letter dated el Ki c da 9, 1334, (September 7, 1916) by the hand of Sheikh Ahmed Husid Alaui and fully considered it. You have known of the regard we have for the great British Government as well as the regard maintained by our ancestors towards it. You also know of thefights which took place in Yemen in the past between the esponsers of our cause and the officials of the Ottoman Grovern- ment, after which friendship has been established between the Ottoman Government and us and the sanguinary fights were caused to cease. u Then the general war broke out in parts of the world, during which time we have been true to our faith to them (Turks) and meanwhile we have had regard for the British Government, and kept aloof. “ It was expected that the magnanimous British Govern ment would have kind consideration for the inhabitants of this country who have suffered destruction in the former wars, and would not shut the door against their livelihood from the sea, though the product of their country might be sufficient to provide them with food and other requirements. The roads, however, have been closed and the cold shoulder turned to people who have shown no hostile attitude towards the Government at all. The benefits of the imports are derived by the sellers and buyers, and, the fight has no connection with goods imported to or exported from Yemen. Anyhow, we have said all well (i.e. raised no objection). But we hope that due consideration and justice will be given to our representation as behoves Government. “ As to the allusion to the agreement existent between our ancestors and the British Government in the year 1821, which you have mentioned, we inform you that a long time has since then been passed, many changes and fearful events have occurred and the capital of our honourable Imamate has likewise been transferred ; as is not hidden, therefore it is difficult to find trace of the circumstance mentioned by you at our end at present. “ If it be possible for you to send us a copy of the agree ment we shall consider the matter and let you know after paying attention to it. This will be better. We crave help from God and that He will guide and lead us to the right path. “P.S. “ The aforesaid Sheikh may be treated as reliable by both you and us.” The Desert.

The result was nil, Ibn Rashid refusing Ibn Ajil’s proposal for an attack on Saud Subhan. far from the Hazil wells, which he now controls, to the disgustThat the first three leaders, classed as anti-Turk, are in some sort of agreement, seems to follow from the presence, in each of their forces, of elements from the same main group of the Shammar, the Sinjarah and the Aslam being both constituents of the Sayih section. The Sinjarah sheikhs were reported in our No. 35 (p. 542) to be desirous of co-operating with us. All the three constituents of No. 1 have acted with us for a year past, and their present leader is both a rebel against Ibn Rashid, and a declared ally of King Hnsein of Hejaz. The leader of force No. 2 is also the latter’s armed ally, though it cannot be said of him equally that he has yet burned his boats, and he seems to be aiming primarily at the control of all the Anezah. If Audah Abu Tayi is really with Nuri (as information from Hejaz states), the latter has enlisted a very famous fighter, who, again, has subscribed to King Husein’s cause. About Ibn Sand’s intentions we can speak only with reserve. He is for us, and against the Turk, and he has done nothing against King Husein ; but that he feels jealousy and resentment towards the latter is notorious. He has come to Qasim, and will probably raid Jebel Shammar. The ultimate aims of the three leaders in Class 2 are less easy to analyse. Fahad Hadhdhal is certainly at odds with Nun Shaalan, but, while he has professed sympathy with King Husein, he has done nothing, so far as we know, to aid the Turks. On the contrary, he has written a friendly letter to Saud Subhan. Ajeimi Saadun (though Sherif Feisal reckons him a friend in the future) has lately professed his fidelity to the Ottoman Caliph in the fine reply to Ibn Saud, of which translation follows. Letter from Ajeimi el-Mansur to Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, dated Rabi I. 17, 1335 [January 11, 1917.~] u A.C. “1 have received your valued letter at a propitious hour with the hand of friendship, and have understood all the friendly sentiments contained therein. “But about your statement regarding your present ettorts in makino- reference to the English in my absence and of their acquiescence in your desires regarding myself, and your as mg for my alliance with you and agreement with you and yoor saying that that will not be possible without a meeting and that the obiect thereof is the preservation o£ the rights o£ the Arab race, and that we have taken np an attitude o£ disaffection which is baneful to the Arab race. “ Oh my honoured brother !

And verily I am an absolute ruler by the order of God and the Government, and, according to my conviction and belief. I am walking in the true path which pleases God and the Arab race with constant and unremitting attention, and that is the spirit of Islam. This is the position, and I finish what I have to say by quoting the word of God, (who has said) •'Tou cannot direct to the right path whom you like : it is God who “ If I had given any promise to them in the past or after wards, I should have been bound to carry out m_\ promise. But I gave undertaking for the service of my religion and my Government and mv zeal, and it was incumbent on me to act according to mv real honour, and therefore it is not proper for me to release mvself from what was demanded by my said religion and zeal and honour. The great God is the best of helpers and co-operators, and if you argue on the score of religion, then the discharge of my duty should be according to the promise which I previously gave to my Government, and that is the first attribute of the Arabs. “ This is what had to be explained. “ (Signed) : Ajeimi Saadun.” Uncom romising as this letter is, it should be discounted, perhaps, by the consideration that it is addressed to the Wahabite. Ibn Sand, who, as oppressor of the Ajman (not to mention other ancestral causes of difference), probablv appeals ill to Ajeimi. The most obscure point, however, about this Class is the actual relation of Ajeimi to Ibn Rashid. The latter has shown considerable annoyance before now about the enlistment of chiefs and tribal elements by the former, which Ajeimi considered to be properly his own, and at least one of the chiefs who went to Ajfah, viz., Aqab Ibn Ajil, has been at odds with Ibn Rashid and a particular cause of dissension with Ajeimi. The Ajman, again, since their expulsion from Hasa and Kov^it, have been rather Ajeimi’s men than Ibn Rashid’s. Is Ibn Rashid asserting himself against Ajeimi, and reclaiming the latter's chief allies ? If so, what will Ajeimi do, and will either turn againstthe other and the Turks ? It is possible, since the Turkish troops, who were with Ajeimi, have retreated through Samawah towards the north since the fall of Kut. The presence of Moham med el-Firm at Ajfah, with these companions, is not explicable by anything we have heard before. He has acted with the constituents of force No. 1 for several months, and it is difficult to believe he or his sub-tribe of the Harb are now, or will be, on the side of Ibn Rashid, King Husein’s avowed enemy. But there is no “ scrap of paper ” quite so scrappy as a Bedouin alliance, and we must be prepared for anything in the Desert. NOTES. Wadi Hamdh. The lower valley of Wadi Hamdh is a ten-mile wide depression. “At 3 p.m.,” writes Captain Lawrence, “we entered the wadi itself. It proved to be an immense bed of sandy hillocks a few feet high, cut up with shallow channels, which bore no signs of any general seil, though evidently local showers fill one or other of them frequently. Channels and hillocks are alike overgrown with the thickest growth of ethil and tar fa imaginable. It was difficult for us to force our camels through in places. The bed was in all about a mile wide, running from 100° E. to 300° W., and we cut across it obliquely till 3.30 p.m., when we passed a water,-pool about eighty yards long, fifteen yards wide, and two feet deep in a clay bottom, and 200 yards further reached the bare flint ridge of the Billi bank of the wadi, which extends as an empty plain to the abrupt foot of Jebel Raal, four or five miles away. The pool of water is within a few yards of the well of Abu Zereibat, and one or other of them affords water all the year round.” Wadi el-Ais. Feisal said to Captain Lawrence that the road up Wadi Yambo to the railway at Bowat Station was very difficult for loaded camels. There is a road by Bowat village to Wadi Ais, and another from Kheif Hussein in Wadi Yambo to Bir Fueis, by Ras el-Magrah, between Jebel Radhwah and Jebel Tareif, and thence over a harrah to el-Ain, near Murabba in Wadi Ais. Murabba lies a long day’s journey from the railway, and is said to be the last oasis in Wadi Ais. The water springs and plantations endure for a day’s camel journey west of Murabba, and Wfidi Ais itself for another day after that, up to a high pass between Jebel Tubi and Jebel Mertaba, a day from Wadi Girs and Urn Lej ; These passes (with Wadi Hamdh) are the only roads into Madi Ais, which is bounded on both sides by difficult hills and harrahs. There are many springs and wells of water, but the groves are poorer than those of Wadi Yambo.Wadi A&lt;pq. t , . . , T T n ^ -v, T Qwrpnce that Wadi Aqiq, which rises Feisal told Cap ai flowg tliroug h Tai£, becomes Wadi between Litli and F , d eventually flows between Shaiba near the Harrat ebMut^r ana^e Wad . ^ the Ohod and Medina, as , to Medina is about 300 miles, crowfly distance ion J , must be one o£ the most important this wadi, hl tfler o unexp , Sh ^ £rom Mecca to Medina, •“ to 'os it at Birkah, about SQ 1 miles N.N.E. o£ Mecca : but Xougb this road may hit its course again more than once, the’ reports (e.g. Burton’s) show that it does not follow the iiJ/nnnLnouslv At wadi of the same name reappears just lo^th west o£ Medina, in accounts of pilgrim marches between Medina and Bir Abbas, and possibly this is the lo wer end of the • • i a irvimcrlijirplv before it loses itsel£ m Wadi Hamdh. The Capture of Eshref Bey. Eshref was met quite by accident about 2 p.m. m easy country at a spot called Gambila, about six hours from kheibar, and was galloped down at once, before he could get oft more than sixty or seventy rounds with his machine-gun. The Arabs lost four killed and four wounded, and captured the whole of his party. He had with him letters to Ibn Rashid, Ibn baud, and the Yemen; £20,000 in gold ; presents of carpets and clothes, a machine-gun with five spare barrels and o0,000 rounds, a box of Mauser pistols, etc. Abdullah subsequently marched across the railway between Jedaha and Stabl Antar, without seeing any enemy patrols, and he left, between the metals, a letter to Fakhri with an account of the capture of Eshref. His force includes Muteir, Ateibah, Buqum, and Anezah, and he has got in a few Huteim mer cenaries. The force left at Henakiyah is about 300 strong. The desert seems in a very lively state, and nothing gets through unplundered. Nejd caravans are making for Mecca rather than Medina, to avoid the danger zone. Abdullah sent to Feisal Eshref’s gaudy Medina-made dagger as a trophy (given subsequently by Feisal to Colonel Wilson), and there was great rejoicing in Feisal’s army all night. The H.Q. poet (also chaplain, and as Muedhdhin, waker-up-in- f eneral to the force) produced a creditable ode in sixteen minutes. he ode summed up the situation in favour of Abdullah, but said that Feisal’s opportunities were coming.SECRET.

Jerrab is near Mejraaa in Sedeir.] “Abdullah was on his way to the scene of action, before the battle of Moharram 1334, at the request of Ibn Sand - but unfortunately, he was not in time for the battle and \^as oblige^ to halt at a village on the borders of the Hejaz called Sharaa, S.E. of Aneizah, the capital of Qasim (about 130 kilometres distant) and about 150 kilometres from the scene of the battle.” [Note.—Sharaa is on the Mecca-Riyadh road, about 400 miles from the former, in Ateibah territory.] “ Emir Abullah warned Ibn Rashid (who could not maintain his forces where he was) against advancing on the villages of Nejd and the estates of Ibn Saud. So Ibn Rashid returned to his own country, and Abdullah returned to Mecca. 1 his was when Turkey declared war, and at the time when bad relations began between us and the Turks ; because they asked, when they heard Abdullah was in action, that he should come to Medina and proceed with his brother Ali to Sinai to co-operate with Jemal Pasha. Ibn Rashid’s people consequently were unable to make the pilgrimage in 1334. “ Matters continued thus until the chiefs of the Shammar tribes discovered the mistakes of Ibn Rashid’s policy. Then these men began to send us their excuses and continued up to the time when our revolt took place ; but Ibn Rashid stated, ‘ I have nothing to do with the revolt of the Sherif, because my position precludes me from anything except helping the Turks to whom allegiance is due.’ We set Ibn Rashid aside and wrote to the Shammar chiefs, such as Ibn Tawala etc., that the mind ol Saud Ibn Abdul Aziz (i.e., Ibn Rashid) being under the influence of ignorant advisers, we were compelled to inform them that ithe continued this policy we should be obliged to take, unwillingly, strong measures against the Shammar. These warnings had a good result, and in the last three months we have^ received special information that a friendly feeling lor us has arisen ; and even Subhan, the Chief who is under Ibn Rashid, wrote^ to us three weeks ago that the Turks , had come to Ibn Rashid and compelled him to assist them. Subhan had warned Ibn Rashid that, if he moved south to fight against the Sherif, Subhan and Ibn Tawala would go straight to Hail and^teach him a lesspn. Ibn Rashid did not comply with the Turkish demands stating that he was unable to do so. “ This is the summary of that which you inquired of us. “Doubtless, in time Ibn Rashid will correspond with Abdullah or Zeid, but Nuri Shaalan has detached some people to Abdullah—about 300 camelmen, sent by Nawaf, the son of Nun himself. As you have previously heard, Abdullah has armed them from the arms at Yambo and given them hospitality and a good deal of money.” Raid on the Hejaz Railway. The following is a summary, with occasional textual quotations, o£ Bimbashi Garland’s report of his recent expedition from Wejh to cut the Hejaz railway : _ .„ The’ party accompanying him was provided by Shent Feisal and was composed of Sherif Abdul Kerim Beidawi of the Juheinah Sheikhly family, two other Juhemah sheikhs, one Billi and one Aneizah sheikh, twenty-four men of the Juhemah and Aneizah, and AH Nat'gan with twenty-three men of A ° e) Although Feisal, in choosing Abdul Kerim p gep ‘he party no doubt thought he was giving a good man, and certainly an influential one, it early became clear choice could possibly have been made. Absolutely incupame of action criminally haphazard and careless, he was responsible for all the delays of the party and for none of itssucces^ Day ± e ^rt::iy “ r tHr i Bedouin encampments en route^ ^^yAeleverArient and faS'no^littK anxiety to the Nairani, who was regarded as a sort of a curio by the women and children of each camp. . . ^ ft is distinctly inconvenient to have a person of the dignity Sherif who finds his chief pleasure m Juheinah tnbesmer?r^ere'no* better j but the other sheikhs, the few Aneizah, and the Ageyl behaved splendidly. . , . i P ,., r ,h,, —%«««', , K The camels were bad and the saddles worse.

In one place as we neared a Bedouin encampment 1 asked one ot the Leyl of what tribe the Bedouin were and whether they were for die Sherif 1 No,’ he replied, ‘ not for the Sherif ; for British a-old.’ In this part of the world, gold is now so plentiful that the British sovereign may almost be said to be the unit ot coinao’e. The filthiest Arab unearths (the term is no mere faeon de narler) a ba&lt;&gt;' of gold when making his purchases in the Suq T L,l tW r^m) for a camel as an ordinary procedure.” Notwithstanding these disconcerting elements (Bimbashi Garland says that at one stage he was firmly convinced that Abdul Kerim had no intention of ever reaching the railway line), the ] arty, which had left Wejh on February 12, did reach the vicinity-of the line towards sunset on'February 20, the distance being something over 120 miles as the crow flies. The- Aneizah scouts reported all clear ahead, and the party arrived within about'300 yards of the railway line. One man of the Ageyl was sent forward to ascertain whether it was safe and possible to take the camels any nearer. He reported that it was ; hut Abdul Kerim and his Juheinah could not be induced to approach any nearer. Bimbashi Garland, however, and the Ageyl, with several sheikhs, went forward on their camels, finally dismounting and securing them about 150 yards from the railway line. Abdul Kerim and his men stayed at the first stopping place ,300 yards away, chattering and lighting cigarettes, and in general giving away the position to any Turks who might have been about. On reaching the line, the raiders found a small two-span, strongly-built bridge. Some of the Ageyl were instructed about the charge to be used and the position in which it was to be placed, while Bimbashi Garland went southwards along the line about 400 yards, accompanied by Ali Nafgan and three sheikhs, to lay the first mine. Up to this time, they believed that the guides had. as they stated, led them to a point roughly midway between two stations, Toweira and Mudurij, about fifteen miles apart. They had been preparing the mine about five minutes and the hole for it was half dug, when one of the Ageyl ran up saying that he heard a train approaching. It being contrary to all his information that the lurks should run trains in the dark, Bimbashi Garland, hearing^S' Tt thGieirofto ™lley is Khautlah, where is no settlement, — 129 — nothing himself, proceeded with the arrangement of the mine, but a few minutes later, much to his astonishment, heard a train leaving a station, blowing off steam, and whistling. The fact was that the guides had taken them to within 500 yards of the rather important blockhouse of Toweira. Bimbashi Garland’s original intention had been to destroy thoroughly about 500 yards of rails', and, at points a quarter of a mile on each side of the section destroyed, to lay a heavy mine adjusted so as to be exploded mechanically by the first locomotive travelling each way : then, after laying the mines, he would withdraw to the top of some adjacent hill^ until a train came along, to see that the mines worked, and if not to re-adjust them at some convenient time in the dark. I he approach of the train, however, five minutes after starting work forced him to decide in a moment whether to stand by and let the train pass, and lay the mines comfortably afterwards, or lay a reduced mine and wreck the train without blowing it up as badly as a large mine would have done. He decided on the latter course, filled the hole with explosives, and had just completed the mine to find the train approaching within 200 yards. He bolted into the night, making slow and paintnl way barefoot (having removed his boots so as to leave no tell-tale prints) over bad ground, and turned after fifty yards m time o see the mine explode, much closer to himself than was de sj ra1 ? l( p He saw the engine rock, leave the rails, turn over and fall wi i a crash down a small embankment. boon after, mihtary commands were heard, from which he formed an idea that it was a troop-train, which was confirmed subsequently by reports from Arabs who passed the scene later Notwithstanding the risk of delaying their departure, Ah Nafgan and several Agey ran down to the charge on the bridge and fired it, and also two on the rails. The damage had the effect of cutting off the train on the north, and the bridge must have been so much damaged by the gelignite as to need completely le-bmldin In the dark it was impossible to see what damage b ee n don tn the eno-ine The partv returned quickly to Abdul iveum and his m°en but it was -impossible to make him move away speedily, and’it was certainly not owin ? to his good management that they ultimately succeeded in crawling off into safety. Kimhashi Garland has furnished a valuable route-report am eliart of his iourney up and back. He followed the mam ffejh- Medina track whik if called Darb Sultani and is a recognized Medina tra , d £ Wejh to the fort some six miles— 130 — , n . fv feet deep, and fitted with a new but but only a large ^el, fr0 m Wejh).

The rest of his route lay across country, the W 7 adis Safrah and Jizal being crossed in succession and W adi Llgat, a tributary of the latter (which is itself a right bank affluent of the Hamdh), being ascended to the point where the railway has to cioss it, a little south of Toweira station, the distance acioss country, aftei W T adi Hamdh was finally left, Bimbashi Garland gives as about forty miles. In W adi Jizal he met with three good wells, but he found the country increasingly bare of vegetation as he proceeded. His whole march reckoned by camel-pace (three-and-a-half miles an hour), was 153£ miles, and he thinks that the Hejaz railway at Toweira must be some twenty miles (crowfly) nearer the coast than our maps place it. Defences of the Line. Bimbashi Garland further reports as follows :— It seems that the Turks have a system of blockhouses along the line now, something like a mile apart. There was no barbed wire on the line. The two posts were not more than 1,500 yards apart, and he was told that at Toweira a company is stationed. Natives of the district say the line is patrolled by troops mounted on camels and mules ; also, first thing every morning, a trolley with twenty men runs from station to station to inspect. It was also reported that the system for catching raiding parties is as follows : Mounted troops start from the station on each side of the section attacked, the northerly detachment proceeding SW. and the southerly N.W., hoping thus to hold the raiding party in the resulting triangular area. 1 his is the first time that the Turks have had a train wrecked, and it is to be supposed that they will now have to search the line thoroughly every day for mines, and that they will hardly dare to run trains at night in the future.— 131 — The line appeared to be well-laid (technically known as spiked rails with wood sleepers) and the bridge was very substantial for its size. Camel Forage. Green food for camels was very sparse along the whole route. Although rains had fallen quite recently, most of the grass and green bush was burnt up. It would be inadvisable to move any large force on the assumption that the camels could live on the country. Fuel. Fuel was abundant. The party did not see a single palm- tree, or pass any village or permanent Bedouin camp. Water. Water was abundant and fairly good, except in Wadi Hamdh. This, however, was the best time o£ the year (just alter the rains') and in summer most of the natural cisterns probably dry up The only wells, properly so-called, met with were six outside the fort near Wejh and one at Khautlah, and the only spring, small but, according to the Arabs constant, was in the .J P ebel S immediately south of Jebel Raid, about fourteen hours camel-ride from Wejh. MESOPOTAMIA. Ismail Bey. Ismail Bey, son of Ibrahim Pasha Mdh, arrived at Zubeir on December 28, seeking British protection and ottering us ns co-operation against the Turks. His father was the most considerable figure in northern Mesopotamian politics during the last ten or fifteen years of Abdul HamidTreign. He had established, with the favour of the bultan d f l iter’s powerful minister, Izzet Pasha, an authority all d of the “ s U overeianty ’ ove r the country between Diarbekr'a d R as e l-Ain, and he controlled the northern roads between tie Euphrates ’and Tigris.

The mother o£ Mamu Ismail and Khalil is Khansah Khanum, a lady o£ remarkable force of character who administered the family estates when the elder son were imprisoned in Diarbekr after Ibrahim s death. Abdul Hamid died hr prison, but Ismail and his brothers were released after a captivity of many months’ duration, and their possessions w n great part restored. Though the power of the ruling house had suffered, the Milli remained a strong tribe, trained .... arms in the Hamidiyah levies, while the sons of Ibrahim aie still - i i ii* I-1~»/■*i tt/'m iPn nr* Ismail is a fair man, of medium height and slight figure, pleasant mannered, with a fine confident bearing He looks what he is, the son of a great chief, accustomed to dealing with hKh officials, and' conversant with big political issues. He speaks with affection and respect of his brother Khalil Pasha, who, according to him, has some 1,400 troops, more or less trained in the Hamidiyah, under his command. He himself claims to have about 400 horsemen of a similar kind, and says that his tribe numbers 25,000 men and can raise 12,000 horse. He includes, no doubt, in these last two figures various Arab tribes, such as the Adwan, who come directly under the influence of the Milli, and probably he intends them to cover the Shammar Jerbah also. The half-trained Milli horsb he speaks of as the Sabyan. They are all armed with Mausers and have plenty of ammunition. He suggests that he should summon his 400 men to the Iraq, if we could get thein safe passage through Ibn Hadhdhal’s country. He proposes to place them at our service under his command, and to maintain them at his own expense. He is confident that Khalil Pasha would have no objection to their leaving Wiransheher, as Khalil has an ample force of his own. Ismail states that at the beginning of the war the Milli furnished a body of irregular horse to the Turks for service against the Russians. They deserted during the first winter and returned home, bringing with them the arms which they had received from the Ottoman Government. This led to a conflict between Turks and Milli near Diarbekr about a year ago. Ismail claims that the Turkish casualties were heavy and included some German officers, but the upshot seems to have been unfavourable to the Milli, and Ismail fled south, intendingto make his way to the S her it: by the Hajj railway. He was caught at Qatranah and imprisoned first at Shobaq and then at Damascus. After he had been there some weeks, Sherif All Haidar arrived, on his way to Medina. Ismail begged for his intercession with Jemal Pasha, and at Ah Haidar’s instance tie was released, on condition that he would join the Turkish force in Sinai. He succeeded, however, in making his escape to Fawwaz el-Faiz of the Sukhur, and so by the Wadi,,Sirhan to Jauf, where he was hospitably welcomed by Kawwaf $s-Shaalan. While he was at Jauf, Nawwaf received letters from the Sherif asking for his support, but these he tiad not answered before Ismail left. A correspondence was going on between Ibn Shaalan and Ibn Hadhdhal. Nawwaf had urged Fahad Bey to join turn in helping the Sherif, but the latter replied with character istic caution that he was restrained from taking action lest the Turks should seize his lands, but that it would be a different matter if the English offered him their equivalent in the Occupied Territories. Ibn Mijlad is hand in hand with Ibn Shaalan. Ismail considers that he and Hachim Ibn Muheid (especially the latter) are of greater fighting value than Fahad Bey. Since the action a year ago, the Turks tiaye left Khalil Pasha unmolested at Wiransheher. They are afraid of stilling up trouble with the Milli who, according to Ismail, are bitterly anti-Turk. He thinks they would be prepared to take action on our side on the Turkish lines of communication, and he ao-reed that their help would be more useful there than at Kut. ° Nawwaf wished him to remain at Jauf, but he was insistent in his desire to come to us, and Nawwaf provided him with aii escort. He fell in with Ibn Ajil (Shammar Abdah), met Rashid Ibn Leilah near Mashhad, and went from hiin to Ajeimi s camp, where he lodged with a Dhahr Sheikh* (Ibn Dhira ?). He con cealed his purpose from Ajeimi, and told him he was looking for his brother Mamu, who, he has reason to believe is on his way to join Ibn Saud. Ajeimi gave him rajiqs to Dhari Ibn lawala Ismail undertaking to return when he had made inquiries about his brother. Once in Dhari’s camp, he dismissed Ajenm s men and came on to Zubeir, where his arrival coincided almost exactly with that of Saud es-Subhan, whose messengers he had met while he was with Dhari. Ismail reports Ajeimi to be disgusted by the lack of politi^l acumen shown by the Turks in their handling of the Arabs. No doubt it weakens his hand with the tribes. The Milli have no direct relations with Fahad Bey. Ismail is anxious to get into touch with him from here. He looks on Ibn Muheid as a friend, and seems to anticipate no difficulty m roping in the Shammar Jerbah. tsmall believes that a number of chiefs could be induced to join f„ interrupting the railway and cutting the telegraph hue Eg t“eTuphrates.

He^states thaTthe Turks became aware some time ago that the local Hnweitat were being worked upon by King Husein and ,1 , t hp last when after the receipt by Ahmed Teqeiqah, the Huweitet chief! of a letter from the King they realised that the tribesmen would turn on them, the Turkish officers and N C.O s. all went off inland (just as the Commandant of W ejh did, after exhorting his men to fight to the last). The small force o rank and’file, reduced by two years' wastage from one thousand to fifty men, which was thus left stranded, put up a fight, but after losing some twenty killed, had to surrender. The Imam tells us that Ahmed Teqeiqah, a man of about forty, has authority for only about two days journey inland, and is not on good terms with the Beni Atiyah beyond. His cousin, Shadli Alyaii, a much younger man, is a rival for the chiettam- ship, but acts under Ahmed and is quite friendly with him. I he Midianite Huweitat can call out about 2,000 men, but possess less than 2,000 camels. Ahmed er-Uifayah (or Eafai), {see our No. 42, p. 82), is a villager of Muweilah, an old man of consideration, but without tribal authority. Turks and Bedouin Sheikhs. The Sharq, under date February 8, states that Jemal Pasha has been handing out decorations among sheikhs, belonging to the Huweitat and to certain small Anezah units, which lie east of the Hejaz railway, evidently in the hope that they will counteract the hostility of the Juheinah, Billi and other tribal elements west of the line. Of the Huweitat, we find in this honours list, Hamid Ibn Jazi, who is called by the Sharq, Grand Sheikh of the tribe, but we do not find Audah Abu Tayi, the most important Huweitat Chief, nor even Arar Ibn Jazi, the head of the Jazi section. Both these last, as a matter of hict,have subscribed to King Hussein. Follows a list oE eight other Huvveitat sheikhs, none of note. Then we have Shehab, Chiet' oE the Fuqara, a poor Anezah tribe, some part oE which, at any rate, was lately with Feisal’s army in Wadi Yambo ; then three other sheikhs oE this little group. Finally Ferhan, ChieE oE the Aida, another small Anezah tribe, which also has been helping King Hussein’s revolt. Ferhan himselE has been reported in communication with the King, but we know from another source that he has also been accepting supplies from the Turks, who, nevertheless, are uneasy about him. Probably he has been playing the usual double waiting game. He commands very few men, but has some importance owing to his noble lineage- Certain other Aida names follow his. There is little reason to doubt that most, if not all, these decorations have been wasted on the desert air. Indian Moslems and King Hussein. The Paisa Akhbar (Lahore), of February 1, 1917, publishes from its local correspondent a letter, in which he says that Mauivi Mohammed Hussein of Batala led the Friday prayers in the Chinian mosque, Lahore, on January 26, 1917. He preached a sermon, in which he dwelt upon the blessings of British rule and urged all Mohammedans in general, and the Ahl-i-Hadis sect in particular, to remain devotedly loyal to the British Government. At the end of the prayers, Mauivi Ahmad Baba Makhdumi read out the proclamation of the Sherif of Mecca at the instance of Mauivi Mohammed Hussein. When the proclamation was being read, the audience were weeping and lamenting the disobedience of God’s commands, in Mecca, by the Turks, as explained in the proclamation. Subsequently, Mauivi Mohammed Hussein told the audience that, in view of what was stated in the proclamation, the Sherif’s dissociation from Turkey was not tantamount to rebellion against Islam. The Mauivi quoted a tradition of the Prophet in support of his contention. He added that the proclamation clearly showed that the Sherif had not put forward the claim of being the Imam of the whole Moslem world, but had only proclaimed the independence of Arabia. Indian Mohammedans had no quarrel with the Sherif for his assumption of the title of Amir, nor had they any political connection with him. They already did not believe the Sultan of Turkey to be the Caliph of all Musselmans. After the close of his- speech, the Mauivi asked those among the audience to raise hands who did not agree with him. But none raised his hand and all unanimously approved of what the Mauivi had said. : ■ c ■ [Note by Arab Bureau.—Though the Paisa Akhbar has its reasons for being Pro-Government, there need be no doubt that what it relates took place.

To judge by an Aden Intelligence Summary, it is evident that news ot recent events is both scanty and indifferent in Thus, Said Pasha, at Lahej, is found writing letters to the Negus Mikhail asking him to send him £200,000, quite unaware of the fact that since October last Mikhail has been a prisoner of the Shoan Government. Imagination, however, supplies any deficiencies. An agent has brought an official Turkish proclamation, published at Beit el-Fakih, detailing all the Turkish successes in the Hejaz and elsewhere and giving the terms of peace shortly to be ratified. These include, among other provisions, the cession to Turkey of Egypt, Aden and Basrah. I he state of local knowledge may be judged by the fol lowing telegram sent by Ali Said Pasha on January 7 to the Acting Governor of Hodeidah, for publication :—“ During the past ten days negotiations have been passing between the various belligerents on the subject of peace, result ing in England being obliged to make large concessions. An armistice has been declared. Russia, France and Italy have been compelled to accept the conditions offered (by Germany) and to agree to pay indemnities. The British have been forced to consent to evacuate Egypt, which is to pass into the hands of the Egyptian Khedive as previously.

The Senussi have definitely given up their plan for the immediate conquest of Egypt, and the result of Ahmed s expedition is a heavy blow to his prestige. A disappointed man, he is ready to quarrel with Mohammed Idris, who has been always sceptical about the chances of successfully attacking the British, and is now convinced that the Turks are not in a position to help him.

The following is a summarized account of the celebration of the festival of Bairam in the Mohammedan prisoners camp at Zossen, near Berlin, from the German publication “ Islamische Welt ” of November last. As an example of the readiness or the Germans to avail themselves of the opportunity for a little tactful and effective propaganda, it is not without interest. There are, it seems, some 14,000 prisoners in the camp, from all parts of the Mohammedan world, and taken from Russians, French and British. Turks who were present in Berlin at the time, and also certain German friends, were invited to attend the celebration, the Government providing conveyances for them from the stationto the camp. One o£ the guests writes : “ We saw the red Turkish flags floating from the barracks and an orchestra played some of our national airs. We alighted in a large square between the barracks, greeted with cries of ‘ Allahu akbar ’ (God is great), which echoed from rank to rank. Then the sacrifice took place. After prayer, Abdul Aziz Shawish Effendi, our great patriot, harangued the prisoners. He first explained the religious meaning of the sacrifice of the Kurban, and went on to say that Mohammed forbade his followers to fight one another, and that the taking of prisoners of war was also prohibited by him. ‘ Therefore,’ he said, ‘ Germany does not treat you as prisoners of war, but as guests.’ He said that this war would end in a victory to the Turks and Germans, and that the prisoners had been deceived by the enemies of Islam. On this holy day, let them all promise to unite together to work for the good of the world and the freedom of their respective countries. “ After a speech by Hakki Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador, who spoke of the benevolent sentiments of the Sultan,‘who thm s of you all, and loves you,’ we all partook of the flesh of t ie sacrifice, after which we returned to the town, and the^sight, as we left, of the red Turkish flag, spoke to us of victory. [Note by Arab Bureau.—Abdul Aziz Shawish, men- tioned above, is of Tunisian origin. He first caiM to^ Egyp in 1904 or 1905, and was employed in the Mimsti} Education.

A report on his first expedition from Wejh to the Hejaz railway has been furnished by Lieut-Col. S. F. Newcombe, D.S.O., R.E., under date March 12. He left Wejh on February 21, with Sherif Nasir (a Shiah from Medina) and about 160 Ageyl mostly mounted two on a camel. They took eight days to cover about 100 miles to Abu llaqa, some sixteen miles S.W. of Khishm Sana station, the camels being good animals, but somewhat overloaded. Ihe idea was that the main party, under Nasir, should attack Dar el- Hamra station, as soon as the morning trolley-patrols had gone out (with a view less to damage than to committing the Fuqara and Moahib tribes, some of whose sheikhs were acting as guides) : two other parties, going north and south, were to lay bombs and prepare for a demolition of rails and telegraph, to be begun as soon as Nasir attacked. On March 3, the northern party, under Shawish Aziz, guided by Moahib sheikhs, duly laid two bombs at kil. S42, The southern party, under Newcombe, guided by a Fejr sheikh, did the same near kil. 900, having had to renounce a more distant objective, south of Matalli station, owing to the nervousness of the Ageyl. Nasir’s first shqts were heard at seven a.m. and Newcombe’s party got to work at once, seven Ageyl destroying about 100 rails, while others ran down a trolley-patrol, which had just passed, and took eight very willing prisoners. Azizs party, having more gelignite at its command, did greater damage to the line, blowing up 150 rails. Fifteen telegraph poles, m three or four places, were destroyed. The attack on the station, however, after lasting four hours at long range, came to nothing thono’ll at one time, it appears, the garrison was on the pom of surrender. Later on the bombs laid north and south pro\e&lt; effective, two engines at least, with several trucks, being blown up. The parties re-united and returned to the rendezvous for more explosives. After waiting in vain for Beni Atiyah guides who finaUy refused to commit their tribe, Newcombe started ^ ao-ain for the railway, this time to a point between Khishm Sana and Qalaat Muadhdham.

At 100 miles, the large permanent pool of Abu Kaqa was reached in a khor, which contains other pools : and after that the way lies mostly over black harrah, rising to nearly 5,000 feet, flat- topped and seamed with deep rifts. One large pool (el-bbaq) occured at 112 miles (4200 feet) beyond the watershed, and within five miles of the railway. 1 he latter heieabouts ascends from the long trough, in which it has run since Batn el-Ghul (about 200 miles), and crosses a low water-parting (3,750 feet) at Matalli. Turkish Forces. It is perhaps worth while to recall, at the present juncture the composition and strength of the Turkish forces which were south f of Maan two months ago, and have not been reported north of this point since that date. They were:— infantry: 3 battalions 1 1 (gendarmerie ?) 42nd Regiment. 55th „ 130th 129th 131st ,, 11 about (?) 7,000 rifles.layfor ■al-Ala tinuiti| thence ! a fe^ 'niaiieiit eida, is i track), .s, hasto Q-Nejd; Amuifa es) into es-Saad' res more ecipitoiis idli, At nt jiinet® which f® gi] report — 145 — Mohafzia (L. of C.) ...

The only addition since that date has consisted in two battalions of 163rd Regiment, reported to us late in February as arrived at Medain Salih and El-Ala respectively. If the head quarters of the 53rd Division, to which this regiment belongs is now to be located at Ludd, in South Palestine, it is possible that those two battalions have been again withdrawn from Hejaz. We know also that a composite force, with headquarters at Tebuk, has been formed on the railway and put under Ivuchu Jemal Pasha ; but it is possible that its components include no elements, not included above, but have been taken irom the old Heiaz Expeditionary Force (of which we know that the major part has J been, or is being, withdrawn northwards) and from the old L. of C. Mohafzia and railway companies. I he only information which we have received indicating new elements is allusion in native reports to Circassian cavalry at iebuk and to new came corps oil the . southern section of the line, the last probably formed from Huteiin or other Arabs.

The following notes on the range, disposition and tenure of the tribes in north-western Sinai are taken from a recent mmute I eut -Col A C. Parker, Military Governor of Sinai Ay aid a. This tribe lives in the country which may be described rouphly as the triamde Maghara-Um Mukhsheib-Ismaiha The Sheikh Selim Abdullah has been at Ismaiha throughout the war, assisting Lieut.-Col. Jennings Bramley, D.S 0, and numbers of the men have acted as British agents A number have also acted as Turkish agents, and about forty Turkish rifles were accepted by Salman Shereif, the Sheikh appointed by the Turks, and distributed among the tribesmen at Maghara. N ur Lttendi, the Turkish officer at Maghara, was always doubtful about the loyalty of these men, and a few of them deserted and came to Egypt. On March 21, thirty-three of the Turkish rifles with some ammunition were brought in to El Arish and satisfactory promises given for the collection and handing in of the remainder. Da way hr a. This tribe normally inhabits the country north of the line Bir Abu El-Afein, a point four miles east of Salmana, watering from Abu El-Afein, Bir El-Abd and Salmana. With the British advance a great number of the tribe was removed to Egypt, losing in the process a considerable number of their stock, for which they have now received L.E.300 compensation from Government. Some of the men remaining (probably about ten) were supplied with fire-arms by the Turks, and these retreated with the Turks. Salem Abu Deinat, one of the chief men of the tribe, arrived at El-Arish from the east on March 21, and begged that the tribe might be permitted to return to their land. The reply given was that Id Sueilim, the Sheikh now with the Turks, must first appear at El-Arish, bringing all Turkish rifles issued. Teaha. The area of this tribe is roughly bounded by the line Bodhia-Nekhl-Kossaima-Helal-Yelag, though they own more country to the south. The sheikhs are now havering and writing letters to explain that they cannot come in for fear ol l urkish reprisals. They may be expected to make submission shortly.Sawarka. Area roughly within line El-Arish-Lahfan-boundary pillar Katib El-Arais-Nuga Shabana-Sheikh Zowaiid. This tribe received from the Turks 163 rifles. 160 families are settled at Masmi under British protection. Sheikhs of those remaining out may be expected shortly. Terabin. Maghara neighbourhood, Magdhaba neighbourhood, \\ adi El-Amr (north of Kossaima) neighbourhood. The sheikh appointed by the Turks is associating himself with the Teaha policy, and may be expected with them when they come. He appears to be afraid that some of his people at Maghara may surrender their Turkish rifles before he comes in himself, and has sent them orders not to do so. The names oi two young men who fired on the Camel Corps patrol at Maghara on its return from Hassana have been ascertained, and they will be punished for it when opportunity offers. Land Temur. l and tenure in Sinai is in a more or less transitional stage. South of the El Arish District the land is divided into tribal areas, in which members of the tribe may graze their animals, or take up for cultivation previously unclaimed land. Thus a single plough mark round an area gives exclusive rights of cultivation to an individual of that tribe, provided the land is within the tribal limits and has been previously unmarked. The tribal boundaries are often vague and in dispute, and cultivating rights have in some cases passed to members of other tribes. Where this is the case, it will often be found that the alien tribesmen have originally been employed to cultivate the land on account of their superior industry paying as rent a proportion of the crop, and have gradually obtained an exclusive freehold owing to the absence of the owners or to a series of rainless years, during which the owning tribe has been unable to uphold its rights. An instance o£ disputed boundaries is that of the Wadi Masarin at Maghara. Originally tins was probably Terabn lan l the Avaida by some means managed to get a tooting, 1 in ^ probability continue to hold parts of it or even to .'l te, ,i their holdings. The case is the origin of perennial com- ^tets from one oAoth parties, nor is it desirable to settle ,t m too great haste. v millr* of the ri ,T hts of tribes within their own areas— 14S — „ M «.7 'f“ “f asriwri sk®» * - -*-« k This selfish right appears to have little to recommend it, and to stld in the way of /he development o agneuWl ^ ties It must be remembered, however, that the primary utility of a country, where rain is scarce and cultivat.on fortuitous, is found in the grazing of stock. The tribe owning the grazing richts have therefore a strong claim to be consulted before set- tiers of other tribes, potential thieves of unguarded camels, are -cttt-i- fl m Tm£*1Y* Another interesting land dispute occui red not long ago in the neighbourhood of Kossaima, the Teaha tribe claiming to expel a certain Haj Lueimi, of the Terabin tribe, from areas he was cultivating at Manbata. The land appeared to be within the Teaha limits. Enquiry showed, however, that a Jong time pre viously the two tribes had been at war, and that during this period the Terabin had at one time temporarily extended their bound aries, and had kept the land sufficiently long to' cultivate a part of it, thus establishing a right. Subsequently, the cultivator appeared to have extended his boundaries by small encroachments, on the surrounding land. Judgment was given with the assist ance of Arab Sheikhs, making good the Terabin claim to the original area taken up by them but returning to the Teaha the land subsequently added. As regards tribal areas, it is interesting to find some tribes, such as the Safaiha and the Huwetat, which have apparently not yet acquired any legal rights (according to Arab Law) to any land. The first named tribe, a branch of the Lehaiwat, appears to have first entered the country to assist the Terabin against the Teaha. . From long usage they appear to have established a right to live near Um Mukhsheib, and further south between Mineidra and Majmar, and a few years ago they laid claim to the cultiva tion area of Hegaiib, near Jifjafa, but failed in their case. The eastern part of the El Arish District has a much greater rainfall than the country to tlie south, and consequently contains considerable areas of land, which may be regularly cultivated for winter crops of barley and wheat and for summer crops of dura and water-melons. The tenure of the land no doubt began in the same way as described in the south, hut is more advanced, partly owing to the better conditions for cultivation, and partly owing to the enterprise of the people of El Arish in possessing themselves of lands and in improving them. Most of the land which is regularly cultivated at present is held by what must be considered freehold, and the owner has generally, a deed of sale or other document to prove possession. None of these deeds specify measurements of any kind, hut merely the names of the neighbours, if such exist; hence litigation is frequent, and eases are often very difficult to decide.The system of mortage also causes trouble. Here the person lending the money holds and cultivates the land until the amount is repaid, nor is it quite clear whether delay by the owner in making repayment invalidates his original title in favour of the mortgagees. It is obvious that any great delay is in favour of the person on the land si nee r if the owner dies, his heirs may find* it difficult to force the holder to return the land in exchange for the amount of the pledge. A case in point was that of the Gledeirat v. Fereig Ibn Khalaf, regarding land at Geraii, which took place some years ago. The Gedeirat claimed that the land in question had been mortgaged with Fereig Ibn Khalaf for one she-camel. They desired to re-pay this she-camel and to take possession of the land. The defendant claimed that the land had been in his possession for twenty years and that therefore it was his property. The El Arish Court heard the case and gave it in favour of Ibn Khalaf. Subsequently the case was re-opened, and it was estab lished that the land had been in fact pledged for one she-camel, and that the right of redeeming this pledge had been kept good by offers, made from time to time by the Gedeirat, to pay it back. The land had, however, considerably increased in value, owing partly to the work of the persons in possession. The price^of the she-camel was therefore fixed at L.E. 100, which was paid to Ibn Khalaf, and the land returned to the original owners. The western part of the El Arish District, being for the most part sand hills, contains very little cultivable land, though palm trees are grown in most of the hollows, where the watei is not too far from the surface. North of a line Khirba-Salmana, however, there are numbers of patches of sandy soil which may be cultivated when sufficient rains fall. This whole area is now called Zugba and is inhabited by Dawaghra, Bayadiin, Akharsa, Samaana, and Sawarka Arabs, the first named being the most numerous. Twenty years ago or more the real Zugba, a small area near the Bardowil Lagoon, was let bv Government for the collection of colocynth. From continual collection the colocynth became scarce, and the lessees beo-an to collect a part of the crops on the ground, gradually extending their energies until they embraced the whole area at first described. The system gave the lessees power to introduce such cultivators as they wished, and so rendered it almost impos sible to decide, when the lease was discontinued, who had the be^t rio-ht to cultivate. A compromise was finally reached, but had scarcely been put into operation before the outbreak of the wai. During the investigation of the matter a ruling was given b\ the leo-al authorities in Cairo that the land was Government pro perty, and that a rent should be charged.— 150 — ABYSSINIA. General Situation. From reports recently received it seems thnt the situation i„ Abyssinia is probably more involved than any known in the country for the last two generations, ft had been hoped that the coronation of Zauditu, as Empress, and of W aldo Gnorgis, as Xe&lt;&gt;-us of a portion of Mikhail’s late dominions, would have a quietiim effect. No sooner, however, were the ceremonies over than news was received that four of Xegui' pioviuces, Simyen, Wolkait, Wojju and Wogara had risen in revolt and that, driven to desperation by the brutality of the Shoan army, the Wollo Moslems had made a fierce attack on Bessie, and, although defeated, were still raiding the Abyssinian districts. Further, the Arussi and certain recently Islamized pagan tribes from Ginir to Dolo, had taken advantage of the withdrawal, during the revolution, of their Abyssinian garrisons, to rise, while the outbreak of a revolution in Tigre seems merely a matter of time. Lij Yasu is still holding out in the fortress of Magdala and the Moslem populations of Abyssinia confidently expect that he will shortly return at the head of a large Turkish army. Ras Taffari, on whom the full responsibility rests, is surrounded by intrigues of all kinds, both on the part of the Empress, who shows a disposition to assert herself, and the ministers, who are mainly concerned with their own authority and interests. The soldiers and lesser officers are impoverished owing to their long absence from home, and not only are driving the peasanty to desperation by looting for their own subsistence, but would not improbably refuse to undertake a fresh campaign if called upon to do so. The risings, of which every day brings fresh news, do not seem directed to any political object, but can be ascribed to the general relaxation of discipline consequent on the concentra tion of the various chiefs to Adis Abeba. Ras Demissie and four Dejazmaches are concentrated round Magdala but make no serious effort against Lij Yasu, and yet the armies of the provincial chiefs cannot be sent home as long as he remains at large. I I he Negus, Waldo Giorgis, still offended at his original exclusion from affairs and at the refusal of the government to put Tigre and Gojam under his rule, openly declares that his only concern is with the pacification of his own provinces, and that the Council of Ministers may get out of their difficulties as best they can.— 151 — 16 situation own in | hoped tliat 'Giorgio,, uld liavei monies oit : os, Simyeii, that, driven , tbe fol id, althougl i.

The following notes are taken from a Report lately handed in by Lieut. L. Buxton on his return from Abyssinia :— Lij Yasu. No one seems to understand the character of this uncon ventional young man, who is, perhaps, more far-sighted than is usually supposed. When Regent, he was frankly bored by the porn]) of Royalty, and made himself extremely disagreeable to the big-wigs at Addis Abeba. He used to retire into the Danakil Desert with four or five followers for long periods, any messenger who approached him, even from his irate father, being severely beaten. The stories of his fantastic behaviour, combined with his apparently genuine dislike of Christians, seem to have made a great impression on the Somali and other Mohammedan tribes of eastern Abyssinia. To these people, disgusted with the brutal behaviour of the Christian soldiery, and influenced by Turkish propagandists, he has become a sort of legendary hero, and in spite of his frequently proved physical cowardice, they regard him as a Mahdi, who will assuredly come to deliver them from the hated Abyssinian yoke. His great scheme to unite the Moslems and rule with their support, (which has been described in the Arab Bulletin), is still arousing wild hopes and causing widespread unrest. At the same time he is quite capable of posing as an earnest Christian—for dissolute habits are not imcompatible with religious zeal in Abyssinia—in order to return to power, and already men are beginning to say that his return would be preferable to the anarchy into which the country is now falling. Pas Taffari. Ras Taffari and Ras Kassa are probably the only two Abyssinians of rank who are honest and disinterested, and they are also the most educated and refined. Kassi is, moreover, Taffari’s only whole-hearted supporter among the great chiefs. Both trust the British more than they trust any other foreigners, and it was a real compliment to our Minister that Taffari sent his infant son to our Legation during the revolution. Both would like to introduce reforms if they could and dared. Kassa is not aftiicted with Taffari’s fatal weakness, which amounts almost to moral cowardice ; but Taffari has the prestige which attaches to the son of Ras Mahounan, while Kassa’s family are unpopular. Everyone likes Taffari, but nobody fears him. Nothing illustrates his irresolution so much as his failure to get rid of the Council of Ministers, a useless and mischievous body of self-seeking intriguers. The British Minister is constantly urging him to establish a small Council which could do some- thmo- besides talk. Taffari knows that this is an essential reform ; all the big Ras’s would approve, and everybody hates the Ministers. None of the latter are powerful except Hapta Oioro-is, who is by far the best of them, and would support— 152 — Taffari He controls the army of the Central Government. The Bitwaded or Prime Minister (Ha.h Giorg.s) is the cleverest scoundrel of them all, and has made a large fortune by deliberate scheming for bribes. Nearly all are working exc.usively for personal' advantages, while two of them, the Ministers of Justice and Foreign Affairs, are regarded as pro-Germans and would probably welcome the return of Lij Yasu to power. They were orivinallv appointed by Menelik, and therefore enjoy a certain prestige, but under him they were mere cleiks. ^ 1 T /&gt; r I \ i /) y There is very little that the Germans and Turks can do in Abyssinia at present. Since the revolution it has been im possible for them to obtain the funds with which they were formerly supplied by Lij Yasu, nor can they now assist in sending arms to the Somalis. There is probably still some communi cation between the Turkish Consul at Adis Abeba and Ali Said Pasha in the Yemen, but it is very doubtful if anything but letters could now be carried through the desert between Abyssinia and the sea ; while Ali Said Pasha has presumably nothing else to spare. It is practically impossible for any Ger man to escape from Abyssinia, as Herr Gurk found to his cost when he was captured in a starving condition by the French. The German and Turkish representatives have no official relations with Taffari’s Government, and can only help to keep up an atmosphere of unrest and suspicion by casual talk in the cafes of the chief towns. Organized propaganda among the Moslem tribes has now ceased, though the camel drivers still visit the Turkish Consul, and no doubt carry messages to their co-religionists. But as soon as the enemy can send money to Abyssinia they will again become a danger to our interests, and our Minister has proposed that the German Legation shall be withdrawn at the end of the war. In Lij Yasu’s time it was working to persuade the Abyssinians to attack British and Italian territory, and thus divert Allied troops from the main fronts. Arms were smuggled across the Red Sea and handed over by Lij asu to the Mullah. The Europeans at Harrar would probably have been massacred had not the Abyssinian minority in that town got their blow in first and massacred the Somalis. The Mohammedans. 1 he Moslem danger is over for the time being, for when the Christians are not fighting each other, the Wollos and Somalis &amp;c. can be ignored. But during last November the situation was an extremely anxious one, and Lij Yasu’s. cause was by no means a forlorn hope. Had the revolution been postponed for an other year or two, he might well have succeeded in uniting the Mohammedans and making them a formidable power. His iiA nun was apparently to unite the Somalis under the Mullah ; ami he has already married the daughters of all the principal * ° b em c hiets °f Abyssinia. And the revolution might easilyhave been postponed, for the Prince showed great canning in setting one Shoan chief against the other, so that in his long absences from the capital they usually intrigued against each other rather than against him. At the last moment the aged Abuna’s hand was only forced by an outbreak of uncontrollable excitement at the palace, in which a considerable number of people were killed. As it was, a little more Shoan incompetence might have turned the bloody victory near Ankober into a crushing defeat. The Legations at Adis Abebn, whose communications with civilization were cut off for several weeks, made every preparation for a siege; for if the Wollos had reached the capital it is doubt ful whether Negus Mikhail could have restrained them from a general massacre of Europeans. If Lij Yasu had been crowned Emperor, the Abyssinians might never have combined against him, for they have the greatest respect for the Lord’s Anointed. Fortunately the soothsayers advised him that, if he was crowned, he would speedily die. NOTES. Hejaz Intelligence. The retirement of the Turkish advanced detachments on Medina continues, and, no doubt, at the same time, other troops are being withdrawn northwards from that city. On the 23rd we were informed that Bir Derwish had been evacuated at last, the Turks retiring on Manjur, which is some sixteen miles from Medina. Emir Ah claims to have driven them out after two days fighting, and has, at any rate, a uzbashi with nine men, 237 rifles, ami much gun and rifle ammunition to show for his claim. Raids on the railway are continuing. On the 22nd news came that one of Emir Feisal’s detachments had blown up three culverts and destroyed a long stretch of permanent way, a few miles south of El-Ala station. The raiders remained twelve hours near the rails, but were not interfered with—a fact that possibly indicates that the line is now so much cut up that communication along the southern section of it has virtually stopped. I bn Sand's Movement North. A certain Mohammed ibn Fahad, from Malham in Aridh, who left his home about February 10, has given some information to Basrah about Ibn Sand’s movement towards Qasim. According to him, Ibn Baud had concentrated m the Khafs district N.E. of Riyadh, and moved north with elements of the Dawasir, Sebei, Sahul, Aid Murrah, Hapr, Qahtan Rhahd, Hawazim, Ateibah, and Arjah (part ot the Ajman) tribe^ some of these being settled folk, some Bedmns. He had sent_ 154 — his brother, Mohammed, ahead to Qasim to raise the levy there. This spring there is plenty of fodder and forage everywhere. Near Mejmaa, in Sedeir, five envoys of Ibn Kaslnd to the tribes were caught (Mejmaa, it should be remembered, has Kashidite sympathies). According to this informant certain of the Ateibah are still with Ibn Saud, one large section, the Slnyabin, who range near Asheirah, 100 miles from Mecca on the Qasim ™arl Vipimy divided in allegiance. Aden Hinterland. Aden information up to March 9.tells us that, according £o m0 re than one independent native report, the tempoiaij, allies, Mohammed Nasir Muqbil and Ahmed Naaman (presuming that the latter is meant by “ Seyyid Ahmed Pasha of Taiz ”) have fallen out, owing to an attempt on the former s life by the latter’s men. Both appear to have appealed to Lahej, and Mohammed has recalled about one hundred of his own men from that place to his assistance. The Subeihi are out on the Lahej-Qatabah route near Nubat Dakim and have looted a caravan.SECRET. AH’Z Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, April 11, 1917. No. 47. SUMMARY.

The influence of the cnpture of Baghdad on Moslem minds can hardly be gauged yet by positive evidence. The local effect has varied necessarily with individual commitments and hopes. As Basra telegraphs, under date April 1, the provincial chiefs in Iraq, who had compromised themselves by a friendly attitude towards us, showed sincere relief at an event which renders the return of the Turks highly improbable, if not impossible. Our principal Mesopotamian allies, the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit, have displayed a joy which is obviously genuine, and if their subjects were not particularly enthusiastic, it matters little, seeing for how much the ruling individual counts in the East. Nor can the attitude of other chiefs and their subjects, not so committed previously, but now within inevitable reach of our arm, e.g. those on the Euphrates below Fellujeh, be otherwise than openly congratulatory. It is only when we look outside the sphere of the local opera tions that the question becomes open. It is interesting, but not in the least unexpected, that the same Basra telegram, summariz ing reports from Persia and the Gulf, should draw a distinction everywhere between the Shiite attitude and the Sunnite. The Shiahs are stated to be delighted by the news at Bahrein and Bandar Abbas, and pleased in Arabistan and in Southern Persia generally. Merchants foresee renewed and extended facilities for trade ; the educated class hopes to enjoy office again in the Shiah Holy Cities ; the common folk expect to be able once more to visit the Holy Shrines in life, and to have conveyance to hallowed earth in death. This last consideration, added to the comforting reflection that a Sunnite Government, which has always shown itself contemptuous and oppressive towards Shiahs, has ceased to sit astride the pilgrim roads, is enough to make the unorthodox section of Islam rejoice at the fall of Baghdad $ and, further, it must be remembered that Shiahs, though personally among the most fanatical of Moslems, have not that sense of, or desire for, unity in Islam, or that deep craving for temporal dominion, which actuates Sunnis. Waiting for the reappearance of the Twelfth Imam, or detached from practical politics by trans cendentalism, they care little if one great city, more or less, pass under Christian government, so their religion and its observances remain unhampered. Not so the Sunnis. Whether they be friends or foes tq us at this moment, to them Baghdad in our hands is one more dreary tide-mark of a receding flood. Even King Husein,^ hearing the news at Mecca, commented upon it to his notables in a spirit of regretful warning. This was what came of suffering u Turanians m'a seat of Moslem power ! Probably no sincere Sunni in the world has received the news with any feeling more joj ful than chastened acquiescence, or more salutary than a conviction that1 tbe ^ prtwked^intease* despondency and to have bet. followed by a tumult h! the Chamber and a shower of pet.tions for peace. At T ahe All Said Pasha, like the stout man he evidently is, At Lahej, ^ chiefs, with an exhortation communicated the news to , to them to stiffen their backs as sole response. In Egypt, while the censorship weighs heavily on the pres^ one can earn Utde about popular sentiment March 14 a paper e of suck known Turcophil tendencies as the “Wadi Nil” twitted Enver with the futility of his past pledges and his present explanations in regard to Baghdad, was very significant. Islam is not despaired of, but the Turk is ; and pro-British or anti- British, the papers throw the blame on the Germans. W hen the news of Baghdad arrived, the .present writer was m an Egyptian province far from Cairo. It was clear that a wide and profound impression was caused, and hardly less clear that some measure Indian press comments are not very enlightening : but evidently hope lingers that we may yet have to retire again from Baghdad. In due course we shall hear, no doubt, from other parts of the Moslem world. It would be especially interest ing to be informed about the state of opinion in Baghdad itself, when the military situation is sufficiently established for civil life to resume a measure of freedom. Euphrates Route to Syria. [For details of both River and Land Routes, see “ Handbook of Mesopotamia,” Yol. Ill (Admiralty War Staff, Intelligence Division, January 1917), Routes I\ E-H ; 46; 47, 48, and 51-59.] , The occupation of Fellujeh, 43 miles from Baghdad by a carriage track and a narrow-gauge light railway, puts us in possession of the head of the Euphratean routes to Syria. These vary in length. It is 470 miles to Aleppo, by the main river side road via Meskineh ; and 434 miles to Damascus, by the direct desert track which branches off from the river at Hit. Longer than either, however, is the most travelled and best sup plied route to Damascus, which does not branch off from the river till Deir ez-Zor, and covers altogether 559 miles. There are known direct tracks from Baghdad to Hit and Anah, which avoid Fellujeh ; but they save very little in distance, are not recognized or organized as through routes, and have very uncertain water supply. They can therefore he neglected. Nor, for much the same reasons, need account he taken of tracks other than those mentioned above, leading off across the Syrian desert from various points on the river, e.g. Jibbeh, Abu Kemal, and Raqqah ; they are too waterless for any hut very small bodies of Beduins.In addition, however, to these land routes, there is the river itself. Its stream, if followed right up to Meskineh, lengthens the distance between Fellujeh and Aleppo to 626 miles. This increase of 156 miles over the marching distance would not counterbalance its superior usefulness, were the middle Euphrates a good water-way ; but, in fact, it is of such a character that upstream navigation could not be carried on continuously without heavy preliminary work on the channel or banks, or the provision of powerful hauling and warping apparatus, at several intermediate points. Though the Turco-Germans claim to have improved the conditions of navigation during the war, we have no information that they have seriously lessened the difficulties of going upstream. There are three very bad stretches : (1) some ten miles from the rock ledge at Fatihat Khidr Ilyas, fifty-nine miles above Hit; (2) from the Bahaleh rapids, two miles above Anah, onwards to Tazali Island, some twenty miles ; (3) the Hammam rapids, 130 miles above Deir ez-Zor and fifty miles below Meskineh. Artificial channels were cut about forty years ago to help navi gation at the first two of these points, but they require re-dredging and do not circumvent all the difficulties. These are only the worst among many rapids, obstructed reaches and tortuous shoals. In the flood months—May, June, and July—there is usually w T ater enough for a clear run up-river from Fellujeh to Meskineh and beyond ; but, at the same season, the current met between Hit and Anah may be of any strength up to twelve knots. During the rest of the year, one would always be running aground or on snags, besides still meeting rapids which call for high power or haulage. There are not tow-paths where needed, and, where there is so little through boat-traffic, there are few or no skilled pilots, except for short stretches of home water, as near Anah. A steamer has been coaxed up to Meskineh now and again by a rare tour de force, but no regular up and down service has ever been maintained ; the Turks have tried motor-boats between Fellujeh and Hit and given them up again. A few clumsy keeled boats and keelless coracles, smeared wfith Hit bitumen, are kept for local fishing and ferrying, but the typical Euphratean' craft is the shakhtur, a rectangular raft with a high freeboard, roughly but solidly made. These serve for downstream conveyance only, and are rowed by three or four men apiece. Formerly they were made in Birejik alone, and on reaching Fellujeh, after a drifting voyage of any duration from twenty to forty days, according to the strength of the current at the season and their weight of freight, they were usually broken up and their timbers were sold. The Turks have used them much in this war, for floating down both men and supplies ^ e Baghdad Railway bridge at Jerablus, where Kap.-Lieut. H. yon Miicke, of “ Em den ” fame, has been in charge of the service. According to Turkish papers and a map captured by EE. *orce “ D ” three sectional headquarters were established tor tins transport service at Meskineh, Deir ez-Zor, and Anah ; and between Birejik and Ramadiyeh or Fellujeh, some thirteen landing— 160 — stations were provided. Military shalhiurs have usually travelled in paTrs, lashe’d together each pair being «paWe carry mg a nlatoon o£ 65 men. What their total number 1.1 been ot late is not known, but in 1914 there were said to have been five hundred. Nor is it known whether, as was proposed, metal rafts have been introduced to supersede wooden shakhturs. Jerablus has replaced Bireiik as the main boat-yard, and relays ot trained rowers have been established all down the river A shaLhtiii is built very quickly* and unless (as is probable enough) timber has been scarce it is not likely that empties have been towed upstream amiin ’ To an army, however, advancing or retreating upstream, t P„. wri „ia suoiilv very valuable concomitant transport, could small launches of sufficient power, aided by haulage in the difficult reaches be found to tow bitches of them. It should be observed that the raft buoyed with inflated goat skins, which is so much used on the Tigris, is not in vogue on the Euphrates, owing to ever present danger of puncture by rocks and snags. Sails are not used, and would in any case be of little service on an upstream .■1 * 1 * 1 1.1^ , -m -» y'Vi 1 /'X4“ l ^ A / » IHr/^CAT - xt/atto rrn Where a waterway is of such a character as this, there can be no question of an array using it as its main means of transit or even transport. Roads along the banks must be the main avenues of advance, the river serving as the chief source of water supply. The present writer has drunk unsterilized Euphrates water, both before and during flood seasons, and found it always both sweet and wholesome, though thick. But well-water is also obtainable at short intervals along almost all the route. The recognized Aleppo track keeps always to the right bank, an alternative left bank path from Anah to Raqqah offering no advantages. It is not (or was not before the war) metalled, nor is it supplied with enough bridges over tributary gulleys, which occur with especial frequency between Hit and Anah and above Deir-ez-Zor ; but it is practicable for light wheeled traffic through out, having no long or steep gradients (except little gulley-sides) and running over hardish, if stone-strewn, ground. In May and June, however, the river-flood cuts it in places, and makes the gulleys more serious obstacles. About 1907 a company was formed for the maintenance of a postal and passenger service by carriage between Baghdad and Aleppo. To serve its ends, the track was improved superficially, some of the worst gulleys were bridged, and more police posts were established. The aim of the service was to do the distance in six days by relays of horses, and, in fact, when the present writer was at Aleppo in April 1908, our Resident at Baghdad came through with his wife in eight days, but suffered much from the roughness of the road, and the length of the stages. The Company maintained neither its ser vice ^ nor its existence very long; but its record shows what is possible without regular road-making. Since then motors have followed the track, one in particular, a 40 h.p. Argyll, havingcovered the 337 miles from Aleppo to Anah in 31 hours. Heavy lorry traffic would no doubt necessitate improvement of the track here and there, as well as the strengthening of bridges (e.q. in Anah town), but nothing more serious than could be effected by advance parties of an army on the march. As for the routes which branch off from the Aleppo track at Hit and Her ez-Zor and strike straight for Damascus, they are desert tracks throughout, not provided at any season with water for more than small parties. Without carrying water for the whole strength, an army could not venture upon either route except, possibly, after spring rains. No considerable modern force' is known to have marched by these ways. Nor, for the same reason, have they been used for carriage traffic, although probably the surface presents no insuperable difficulty. A motor car ran some years ago from Damascus to the Euphrates, causing great excitement and leaving many legends among the Beduins. The present writer does not know for certain which track was selected, but believes the car followed, more or less, the southern one, which strikes the river near Hit. D. G. H. Hejaz. The Present Situation. Military operations in Hejaz seem to be somewhat hanging fire ; but this appearance is due partly to defects in our information. Owing to the distance inland at which the forces of all four Emirs are operating, we get news less constantly and rapidly than we did before Medina itself and the railway became their immediate objectives. Moreover, while the weak wireless set at Wejh has not much improved the situation, several patrol ships have been withdrawn; and the B.F.C. flight, recently transferred to Wejh, has only just got going again, aftei finding a satisfactory advanced landing ground at Beidha on the northern road to El-Ala {see p. 144)/ We do know, however, that a considerable detachment from Abdullah’s force in Wadi Ais, with which Capt. Lawrence is at present, has attacked Abul Naim station, under the lead of Sherif Shakir. The latter reports that he destroyed the station and also a tram of seven waggons, and that he killed forty Turks. Details will follow later. On March 16 and 17 some 45 culverts and many rails were wrecked just south of el-Ala by one of Feisals detac - ments which also burned telegraph poles.^ Colonel Newcom e reports a second raid made between Khishm Sana and liar el-Hamra stations, in which 110 rails and much telegraph wire were destroyed; twenty-one prisoners were taken, presumaby from repair-gang#, and'a Turk was killed -No train from the north had passed that point between March 24 and the date of Newcombe’s despatch. But the l urks, it not interfered with, seem able to repair about a kilometre of double track per diem.■w — lf)2 n i A W returned to resume Ins opemtions and Lieutenant Gai land ^ ^ The section of the hue from has gone inland ' )or ted held by 600 Turks, who have Medai n bahh to ®'^ [e(kill ^ alih itself are 300 infantry, of whom three aeroplanes. ^ el .

Wha the precise situation at Medma may be at the moment is obscure Intelligence agents have reported more than once hat the Turks intend to hold the city itself with a small garrison, after the bulk of their Expeditionary Force has been withdrawn to el-Ala and north of this point. Though this report contradicts our statement on p. 125, it may possibly be that an original plan of complete evacuation has been modified either by realization of the difficulty of withdrawal in face of the Arabs along; the railway, or by remonstrances from Fakhn Pasha, who appears still to' be in Medina. The raiding parties sent out by Ali and Zeid are operating now quite close up to the city, and there is some reason to think the Turkish defence of Jebel Ohod The main agent of recent delay has been Feisal, who has not stirred from Wejh for two months. At first he was occupied in compounding the feuds of the north-western tribes ; but though he was formally successful in this task, we ha\e had indications that his influence with both Lilli and Beni Atiyah is not yet decisive. He has, however, received considerable rein forcements of late from tribes still further north. We heard on March 31 that 2.000 camel-riders, with 242 sheikhs, had come in to Wejh from the Ruwalla Anezah, the Sherarat, the Beni Sakhr and the Huweitat, the Amran sub-tribe of the latter being especially mentioned. A further tribal name, Tabt, included with the above, may refer to Huweitat from the Tabit region NE. of Maan. We were informed further that ninety of these sheikhs had offered 140 horses and also arms. A representative of Nuri Shaalan—one Sheikh Shawan—had also arrived at Wejh, and on April 3 we heard that 800 more Ruwulla were expected that day. Also a brother of Nuri is said to be coming to meet Feisal. Audah abu Tayyi, of the Huweitat, has been to Wejh. These accessions of new tribesmen have raised in an acute form the questions of rifles, money, and food supplies ; and the discussion of these is causing further occasion of delay. Though Feisal despatched inland on April 2 a force, with two guns and four maxims, under Sherif Sheraf, he himself has declined to move till he can make good his promise of rifles to the Huweitat and others. This question of rifles is difficult. We had put into the Hejaz, previous to the Wejh expedition, 54,000 rifles, and even after deduction of the first almost useless lot of Japanese arms, 45,000 remain. A careful enquiry made early in February proved that practically all these could be accounted for satisfactorily ; but that many remained in thehands of tribesmen, etc., who were in the field at the beginning of the Revolt, but now were no longer needed, e.g., tribesmen of South Hejaz. King Husein has been urged to call in their rifles, but to get a tribesman to part with a European rifle is hardly more easy than to induce him to draw his own teeth. Feisal has exercised a commendably strict control over issues from reserve stock to new tribal elements ; but when, after Wejh, these last began to accrue in increasing numbers, he made a further demand for 30,000 rifles and 15 million rounds. With some demur, our War Office, on February 21, approved of the issue of 30,000 rifles from Egypt, the Sudan and Salonica, so soon as they should be released by the arrival of new arms from England. These new arms were not despatched until the first or second week in March, and at least a* month must elapse before the rifles for the Hejaz are ready. The C.-in-C., Egypt Force, in response to a further urgent demand from Feisal, very kindly provided an emergency issue of 3,000 rifles which have already arrived at Wejh ; 'and in addition 816 have been secured from the Egyptian Army. While there are obvious objections to pouring rifles and ammunition into Arabia, and no supply is likely ever to satisfy the demand, it is difficult to cry halt so long as the Turks hold on to Medina and the railway. To attack the latter, more and ever more tribes must be enlisted ; and as has been said above, it is very hard to recover rifles once issued. When, however, the tide of war rolls definitely north ward, it is hoped that some considerable transference of rifles from the southern tribes to the northern may be effected. The questions of money and food supplies are hardly less difficult. While gold is becoming an ever scarcer commodity and food has to be husbanded even in Egypt, the demands, and to some extent the real needs, of the insurgent Arabs grow Irom the same causes as affect the question of rifles. A lump sum ol of £100,000, authorized for distribution to northern tribesmen, is rapidly being exhausted, and a definite increase ol the periodical subsidy is urgently demanded. Beduins are not readily to be persuaded that great European Powers, who say they are winning a war, have to go short themselves, and mus ask their allies to go short too. 1 It is interesting that a 20 h.p.

I am asked frequently whether any, and if so, what, book in a Furonean lammage provides a conspectus of the actual social and pohticaf condftions 0 P f Syria. I can only replv that, to the best of my knowledge, there is no such single work. Guide-books do not supply the need, both for the general reason that they- treat such subiects too summarily and for the special reason that, in Syria they devote a disproportionate amount oi their space to one small fraction of the country, viz. Palestine. Nor are the best ideographical compendia much more satisfactory, their sectional treatment of so comparatively small a territory as settled Syria beino- necessarily very brief. Moreover, there is no modern travel- book which describes all, or anything like all, Syria. No govern ment commission, scientific society, or individual explorer, has ever set to work to examine this land as a whole, and produce a comprehensive report upon its entne length. Either, like Oppenheim, the travellers have taken cross sections only, or, like Miss Gertrude Bell, one longitudinal section with occasional digressions to right and left. None has coveied half the whole around. This lack reflects and illustrates the historical fact that, m practical politics, Syria has never yet been regarded as a single entity, and the further fact that one district of it, Palestine, detached from the whole by sentiment, has engrossed popular attention. Therefore one can recommend no single book on the society and politics of Syria, regarded as one land from the Negeb to the Taurus, but only several books on different districts. Those of comparatively modern date and general scope alone will be cited here, and periodical literature, which is not easily acces sible, and Intelligence Handbooks, etc., which may be taken for granted, will be left out of account. To begin from the south, the desert fringe has been rather unusually well studied and is sufficiently described in a group of three good books, Palmer’s “Desert of the Exodus,” Musil’s “ Arabia Petrtea,” and “ The Wilderness of Zin ” (Pal. Expl. Fund), by Woolley and Lawrence. For Southern Palestine, west of the Dead Sea, we are fortu nate in having Ellsworth Huntington’s “ Palestine and its Trans formation,” a recent intensive geographical study of all ancient Judasa and Samaria ; but this book will not be found sufficient by an enquirer about ethnographical distribution or features of social life. Nor do I know any other recent book that will supply this defect. We are better off in the wilder region east of the Dead Sea ; for there we have not only Musil’s book, cited above, but Jaussen’s “ Coutumes des Arabes du Pays de Moab,” and (more illuminating than either of these) a glimpse of the Belqa country through the sympathetic discerning eyes of Miss Bell, as set forth in the opening chapters of her “ Desert and the Sown.” 1 his traveller comes more fully into the picture as weproceed north into the Hanran and Jebel Druz, where Oppen- heim’s “ Von Mittelmeer zmn Persischen Golf” begins to be useful, and more than one of Schumacher’s intensive studies of small districts (Schumacher compiled a map of the East Jordan lands for the German Palestine Society) can be consulted. Returning to Western Palestine, we find a wealth of rather out-of-date books, mostly in English and of pious tendency ; but the most comprehensive and useful are probably Guerin’s “Description de la Palestine” (several volumes) and George Adam Smith’s “ Historical Geography of the Holy Land.” The statistical volumes of Cuinet cannot be neglected for any part of Syria; but they are already somewhat out of date. Great and constant as has been the public attention chal lenged by the Lebanon region, 1 know no good recent book on its societies. Two chapters in Oppenheim’s first volume, combi ned with Gobineau and with Wortabet’s rather ancient work on “ The Religions of Syria,” will give the most necessary informa tion. For Damascus and its oasis, Oppenheim and Miss Bell can be used after the reader has been grounded in earlier literature, represented by Porter’s “Five Years in Damascus,” etc.; and those same two books, with the Memoirs of the Princeton Expe dition (H. C. Butler), and Lady Anne Blunt s “ Bedouins of the Euphrates,” must serve for the desert fringe from the Hauran to the neighbourhood of Aleppo. But about the Orontes Valley and the hills and coast north of the Lebanon proper, there is very little to read. Miss Bell takes one to Homs and Hamah and a little into the western mountains, but even she fails us between Hamah and Antioch. Few European visitors have ever stayed in, and still fewer have described, the middle Orontes V alle} ; and as for the Lebanon and its continuation through Jebel Ansariyah to Jebel Musa, no one ever seems to go to those hills with an exploring purpose, or if any one does, he publishes no record. There are few regions of Asia less well known than that hundred-mile course of the Orontes from Hamah to Jisr Hadid, together with the range which looks down on the one side to its valley, on the other to the sea. In Antioch and Aleppo and their neighbourhoods we return to Miss Bell’s illuminating guidance ; but needless to say, she did not set herself to describe any place m Syria m the gazetteer manner, which alone would satisfy all our needs. In the region remaining to the north, the district of Islahiyah-Rilhs Marash A diaman-Aintab, which used to be called Commagene, two German books of travel are useful, viz H urn aim s mid Puchstem s “Reisen in Nord Syrien,” and Sachaus “ Am Euphrat , but neither is at all comprehensive. The plain truth of the matter is that the greater part of Syria, north of the buttmnds of Eebanoi and anti Lebanon, though it presents few difficulties to enter prising explorers and has much to attract them, remains still “unpublished” in this twentieth century.

In continuation of a note on page 153 of our last issue, it can now be stated, on the authority of a Basra telegram, under date April 1, that Ibn Sand is now, and probably has been for some time, established at Bureidah, in Qasim. His son, Turki, reported a short time ago to have been sent to raise the Muteir tribesmen, has not been heard of further. While Ibn Sand does not seem to be pushing towards Hail, Ibn Rashid, who has been joined by the Ajman, and the Tuman and Sinjarah sections of the Shammar, and presumably has the Abdah section also with him, is reported to be out on a razzia in the Harb country west of Qasim ; though in what strength we do not know.

With Inm was a small caravan which had been brought up _by Nasir el-Khashman (former conductor of the Persian Hajj through Jebel Shammar) Ibn Khashman had not dared to enter Jsejef but had halted at Ain es-Seyyid (5 miles S.W.) and loaded up from there. “ The Sinjarah are at Hazil under Ibn Rummal.

Fahad Hadhdhal is m Batn near Subeikah ; Saud has written urging him to join him, and Fahad has sent a friendly reply saying that he desires nothing Jiut friendship with him. The friction between Fahad and Nuri arises out of their rival claim to be considered paramount over all the Anezah. “ Dhari Ibn Tuwalah has gone to the Batin. He has with him no Aslam but some Suleilai, a section of the Huteim (from W.of Hail). The reason of his removal is this. He had prepared an entertainment for some of the Aslam headmen, among them one Nahdhil. During the course of it Nahdhil was murdered by a man of the Aslam, for what cause is not known ; but Dhari is currently accused of having a hand in the matter, since it hap pened while Nadhil was being entertained by him. Dhari was afraid to remain lest the Aslam should retaliate ; hence his hasty retreat to the Batin. “The Darb Salman between Linah and Samavah is a blank on the map.

It appears that Yahya Ali ibn Thawab, the chief of the Beni Abs, and former general of Idrisi, is at odds both with Idrisi and with other sheikhs of his own tribe. He is said to be receiving assistance in men and guns from the Commandant of Jarb, the northernmost Turkish post in theYemen Tihamah. An encounter is reported to have taken place on February 26, at Khidf el-Butri, which is just north of the Wadi Ain, in Abs territory ; but, according to our information, Idrisi got the best of it by grace of his newly trained gunners. Meanwhile the Turks remain in Joz Belair, leaving Qunfudah practically deserted. They are reported to have carried off the chief sheikhs of the Beni Yalah from Yebah and Kali to Ebhah, but not to have been strong enough to raise any taxes from the Wadi Dokah people. Sherif Nasir of Lith is credited with the intention of returning shortly with a force from Mecca to attack Joz Belair. Yemen. Indications continue of an unrest in Yemen which is be coming chronic ; it is aggravated by Turkish nervousness of an enemy landing near Hodeidah. The Imam, however, is reported still to be helping the Turks, e.g. in settling the trouble with the Zaraniq and others in the Zebid district, who had refused to pay war contributions. The old story of the Imam and his eldest son being at open variance but in secret accord has cropped up again. If it be true, the son is presumably acting against the Turks. There is fresh trouble in the Hajariah district, and help has been sent to Mohammed Nasir Muqbil from Lahej. Aden Hinterland. The significance of the movement of numerous Turkish troops northward from Lahej, reported by the G.O.G., Aden, as observed on March 26, has not been explained further to us ; but the intelligence given in our last issue (p. lo4) and other indi cations of trouble on and near the Yemen frontier may ver\ well account for it. All Safid’s communications have long been pre carious and at the mercy of the Hajariyah people. f A later communication from Aden makes it practically certain that no movement of Turks is on foot more important than the despatch of detachments to deal with local trouble on the Yusufiyin frontier.]notesSECRET. I Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, April 21, 1917. No. 48. SUMMARY. ARABS AND TURKS.- ARABIA.— Hejaz. Intelligence. TURKEY.— Turkish Debt and the War. SYRIA — Palestine. Economic Conditions.ARABS AND TURKS. The policy o£ the Allies, declared, and presumably immutable, is to remove the Turks, as a governing people, from all regions in which the Arab-speaking races are more numerous. We are committed to expel from that area the element which has been effectively dominant in south-west Asia, with very brief interruptions, for nearly a thousand years, since the first appearance of the Seljuks in Iraq. Indeed, if we take account of the long subservience of the Abbasid Caliphs to their praetorians, we must date Turkish control of Arabs back into the eighth century. This domination, however, with its implications, is not all that is threatened. The Turks have supplied to Sunni Islam the only enduring political force which 'it has known—its single steadying influence. Never changing their dynasty, and responsible for no religious schism, the Osmanlis have kept the Sunnites together, with their heads in one unchanged direction, for the last four centuries. Of their predecessors of the same race, the Seljuks, Sir Mark Sykes has put it well in his Caliph's Last Heritage that they “have laid the foundations of all that is virile and enduring in modern Islam.” It is not suggested hereby that our polic}- is wrong or should be revised. Circumstances not under our own control have determined it. But after we have destroyed—or even while we are destroying—we have to construct, and we shall be in the better position if we have realized the faults as well as the merits of those we are about to set up, and the virtues as well as the vices of those we are setting down. When we look back over the history of the early Caliphates —and we must so do, since the present hopes and pretensions of the Arabs, and the popular belief in their coming Renascence rest equally on ancient history—we find the period of genuine Arab Empire extraordinarily short. Arabs governed Arabs, through Arabs on an imperial scale for much less than a century. It is just the Omayyad Caliphate—the Damascus period and no more. The short previous Meccan period was all conquest and raiding accompanied by no more organization of territories overrun than would secure their payment of tribute. The long Baghdad period which was to follow would not be government by Arabs of Arabs through Arabs. If the Abbasids were Meccans, their ministers, great and often small, were Iranians or Turanians and their trust was in mercenaries, at first Persian, then Turk, Circassian, Kurd—any race but the Arabian. They themselves, even when Baghdad had filled with Semites, w^ere patently anti-Arab and obscurely Shiah, though later they would parade conformity to the Sunna, which Baghdad itself had laid down. And if Abbasid rule in Iraq will not satisfy our formula, neither will it nor will that of the Omayyads— 174 satisfy it in Egypt, North Africa, Spain or Iran. For there the subjects were non-Arab, and soon many Governors would not be Arabs either, but Turks like the Tulumds of Egypt, or Berbers like the dynasties which were to detach the Mediterranean shores of Africa from the distant inland Caliphate, which knew nothing about the sea. Sir Mark Sykes appreciated more justly the character of the *Vbbasid Caliphate than the reason of its coming to be, when he wrote that it grew out of an “ undefined wish to replace a government centred in an Arabian oligarchy in Damascus by a cosmopolitan Caliphate representative of the other peoples who had been swept into the folds of the mantle of the Prophet.’' The compelling cause was rather the force of economic gravity in the great plain-land of south-west Asia. Its centre shifted as inevitably from Damascus to Iraq as it had shifted from Mecca to Damascus. Lean Hejaz could keep it less than a generation : richer but not opulent Syria grappled it for two, but, once released, it could only swing round to rest where the immemorial seat of Empire has been, whenever Empire has lodged in Western Asia. Should Empire be there again, the centre of gravity will swing round the same arc. Mecca will not keep it, nor can Damascus long; its swing may be more slow, since Iraq is not now what it was before Hulagu ruined its canals ; but eventually it must gravitate to the old point of rest, and Semitic Empire will cease as before to be purely Arab or purely Semitic, or anything more pure than West Asian. There are Arabs who know this. Tradition and hope of the Hashimite Caliphate of Baghdad was doubtless in the mind of the Emir of Mecca when he claimed the style and title of Hashimite King. The brevity of purely Arab Empire was determined less by the force of non-Arab elements than by the inability of Arabs themselves to develope any system of imperial administration more adequate than the Patriarchal. They made no other contribution to the science of government. The Omayyads alike in Syria and Spain seemed to have carried on with the machinery they found, insisting only after a time on expression in Arabic. The Abbasids o'Wed a better system to non-Arab bureaucrats. Ao Arab Caliph ever conceived anything so effective and stable as the Household machine which Suleiman, first Ottoman Caliph, perfected on the model of the Imperial system of ancient Rome. This is the dark side of the medal. There is a bright side. It the Arab could not conceive or construct an administrative machine, he could use one which another had made, and he could impose and maintain himself in supreme place at great distance from his home and for long ages, supported by surprisingly few men of his own race. Except in the history o t e later Roman Empire, there has been nothing like that unquestioning and frank acceptance of one race, as born to pover, which was conceded to the Arab from Persia to Spain.It was not only that Arabs were installed on thrones and treated as God’s noblemen, but that all sorts and conditions of men of other races Arabized themselves in name and speech. History tells us that, in fact, Ahmed ibn Tulun was a Turk and Saladin was a Kurd ; but except to the credit of the Turkish or the Kurdish blood, neither fact matters at all. What does matter is that the Tulunids and the Eyubids wished and ultimately believed themselves (as their remote descendants still believe) to be Arabs. Though some of the earlier leaders, for example, Omar, Khalid ibn Walid, and Moawiya, not to speak of the Prophet himself, were conspicuously able men, the mass of those Arab aristocrats of the world do not strike us as superior persons. They were imposed on society by a combination of influences—by the prestige of a whirlwind of conquest which made fighting men wish to be Arabs, as Napoleon’s deeds once made many wish to be Frenchmen ; by the Arabs f valuation of themselves as a Chosen People, and perhaps, most of all, by that desire for a national link with an exclusive God which has made earlier men deifv their Kings and later men live and die for a principle of Legitimacy, however ignobly personified by the contemporary claimant of divine right. Be that as it may, the Arabian has to be ranked among the great assimilating races of history. But so too has the Turkish which has made Osmanlis of more and perhaps better aliens- Albanians, Slavs, Anatolians, Kurds, Circassians—than its rival has induced to be Arabs. Indeed, the lurk has assimilated not a few Semites, while fewer Turks have ever come to regard themselves as Arabs—probably none at all during these last four centuries of the subjection of the one race to the othei. This is by no means all. The Arabian claims rank too among the fighting races of the world; it claims to be of the greater civilizing races ; and, finally perhaps to be the greatest of all races that have conceived and propagated a faith. It the battle-force of the Arab is inconstant, self-conscious and too soon spared or spent, and therefore, has gone down before the steadfast, unsparing drive of the Turk, there is no comparison between the two races as exponents and agents of civilization, the Arabs developed culture both while they fought and when they had done with fighting (as under the later Abbasids) and were paying others to fight for them. As a governing race it might be said of them, as a great historian of antiquity has said ol another people-they began to wither when they kept the peace—had their literary, scientific, artistic activities ever been more conspicuous than under those latest Abbasids Arab civilization owes heavy obligations to the Greek, to the Persian, to the Jewish, but not heavier than are debited to all othei peat civilizations. Every advanced human culture must be eclectic and its originality is reckoned by the measure m which it transforms and makes its own what it has seized.— 176 — So much foi-ancient history. It shows us, on the one hand, the Arab people, capable of most dynanne ideas, and able to impose them swiftly and finally on aliens within a wide radius of ts P homeland,but, this done, delivered incontinently of new ideas modifying the first and making new. disunion ; terrible but very brief ill war ; inapt to conceive, organize, or maintain a system of government more adequate to Imperial purposes than the Patriarchal ■ of a natural nobility which, under the influence tof a religious idea and the military success of its propagation, has been accepted freely by numerous alien races as superior to then- own nobility: receptive, constructive, and prolific of the higher civilization/builders of cities, quick to sink actual resources m oreat works for future increase of wealth. On the other, the Turkish people, equally terrible in w^ar but more enduring, incapable of conceiving or adopting the higher civilizations, but tenacious of an idea received from without and immutable in practice ; able to administer a system of government and to hold by it, though good or ill ; as full of the will to power as any Arab, with more effective sense of national unity. To-day we are face to face with these two peoples, still incompatible, although one has been subjected in the main to the other for some four centuries, and once more at open odds , and, of the two, we are to help the subjugated race to an enduring freedom throughout its own area The shift of the world’s balance of power and centre of civilization, to the West since the sixteenth century, has affected equally both Turks and Arabs, depressing their relative importance to mankind and their pride in themselves. Inevitably both have become more dependent, or one may say (without intending offence), more parasitic. So far as reception and assimilation of European ideas and practice go their positions remain much the same, levantinized Syria balancing levantinized Anatolia and Constantinople. But in the acquisition and use of European material the- Turk has had the pull from his geographical position and his political dominance. Borrowed things however, affect vitally but a small part of either race—those members onlv that live or have come 4 into the outer westward fringes and taken on the varnish of the Levant. Behind lie the masses working out their own salvation. It is between the respective masses of the two peoples that the instructive comparison lies. Neither can be said to have made much spiritual progress in these four centuries, and certainly not one more than the other : for the idea of nationalism is about equally dormant in both. But the Arab mass has lost most, because it had most to lose. One most vital thing has passed from it— the religious prestige which secured it apostolic primacy and consequent empire. The control of Islam has been in the hands of its rivals too long, and the fire of faith has burned everywhere to° I° w 5 j' or the spiritual force of the Arabs to be a political force again. J o be an Arab, even to be an Alid, is no longer anambition which possesses men of ali^n races. Even among Arabs themselves, descendants of the Prophet are become very many and rather cheap, and one Sherif or Seyyid holds himself about as good as another. The best of them derive their status from something more potent and less honourable than the blood of the Qoreish. The ruling house of Mecca owes, in all men’s sight, its elevation and present wealth to an Albanian Pasha of Egypt, and its present head to appointment by the Porte. King Husein will have to rely on very much more than his pedigree if he is to be the agent of a new Arab unity. As well as his apostolic primacy the Arab has lost, not his aptitude for culture, but his distinctive civilization. Centuries of subjection and the ruin of the apparatus which ensured ease and leisure in Iraq, and also in a lesser degree in Syria, have reduced him below even his neighbours. He can show a spirit of humanity superior to the Turkish, but, at the moment, few of its fruits. The Turk, on the other hand, has suffered no loss equal to the Arab’s. While the latter no longer has that which gave him international importance, the former keeps the virtues, lower and few, by which he conquered his rival at the first his un imaginative tenacity, his disciplined courage, his will to power, and his steadfastness in the pursuit of it. Left to himself, if there were a fair field and no favour, he would undoubtedly continue to govern the Arab as ill as in the past, but to govern and police him always. It is not from failure of either will or capacity that the Turk must give way : nor, when the roof falls on the Philistines, will it be because his old strength has returned to the Arab. Once it was said in mockery of a Jew, u He saved others . Himself He cannot save and neither of that Jew nor of Jews in general is the gibe true. Of their Semitic kinsmen it might have been said so often, not in mockery, that we stand forewarned. D.G.H. ARABIA. Hejaz Intelligence. On April 9, a messenger brought news to Mecca that All had summoned Medina to sunencter , uiat renlied bv afitinn- for a three days armistice, and that Ah naa s SMBSSaS SSEfSSrfc BST-ia- - ~f —*— 178 — troops since the transference of our planes to Wejh that reinforcements have been getting through from Medina. Mecca has indeed, reported that most of the Medina garrison came to the’ assistance of the post and suffered the loss of two machine- o-uns and many men. In Medina and neighbourhood there are certainly at least two line regiments, the 42nd and the 130th, still left, besides Takruris, perhaps a gendarme battalion, and some technical troops. Three aeroplanes are said to have been burned as useless, there being lack of petrol and possibly of aviators : and three others have been sent down the railway to the El-Ala- Tebuk section. With the troops distributed on tbe railway south of Hadiyah, the remnant of the Hejaz Expeditionary Force (as distinguished from the Composite Force) has now a total combatant strength of just under 5,000 men. The Composite Force is commanded by Mehmed Jemal, not, as previously supposed by “Kuchuk” Jemal, former O.C. at Jerusalem. Sherif Ali Haidar, the Pretender, left Medina early in March with his three sons and got through to Damascus. The Turks have organized, on the railway, patrols and repair- gangs of remarkable efficiency, and none of the Arab raids made hitherto has caused more than a very brief stoppage of either transport or telegraphic communication, The Arabs, on their side, have been unable, owing to transport and supply difficulties, to maintain forces near enough to the line to keep communications cut continuously. But they are now both reinforced and better supplied. On April 11, we heard that two of Feisal’s lieutenants, Mirzuk and Sherif Mastur, had destroyed, apparently at their leisure, the one, 1,200 metres of permanent way north of Medain Salih station, the other, a culvert near Abu Taqa. The next day came news from Feisal that his Wadi Hamdh detachment had blown up the bridge at Baraka (we guess this to be the bridge near Abul Naim, repaired since Abdullah damaged it a month ago). Since then a heavy attack has been made on the Muadhdham-Dar el-Hamra section, about which we await news. The presence of Feisal’s force in this region will probably bring in again the Fuqara Bedouins, who have not been over zealous of late. Meanwhile sheikhs of northern tribes have continued to come to Wejh and offer prospective and conditional service to FeisaL Ihe latest arrivals (on or about April 9), besides Audah a u an( ^ ^ wo 0 ther Huweitat chiefs, Mohammed el-Haitan and Abdullah abu Tayyi, have been five Shaalans, viz., Mukhem (a favourite nephew of Nuri), Meshraf (a cousin), Majid, braithan and Farhan.

Two machines had to descend far inland for lack of petrol, but were found, supplied and recovered intact after forty-eight hours. TURKEY. Turkish Indebtedness and the Cost of the War. The speech pronounced by Djavid Bey, in the Turkish Chamber of Deputies, on March 3, 1917, contains statements on the subject of the increased indebtedness of Turkey, since the declaration of war, which may be taken as fairly accurate, seeing that they agree in the main with what we already know of the different advances made by Germany to her ally. In the summary which lias reached us, the amounts of the successive advances are not very clearly set forth, but the conclusion is arrived at that the general debt to Germany, including the last amount of L.T.32,000,000 to cover expenses up to August 1917, amounts to L.T.142,000,000. To this must be added 240,000,000 Kronen which are being advanced by Austria, as well as the sums due by the Turkish Government for arrears of salaries and for the redemption of requisition bonds ; and the grand total of new indebtedness from the declaration of war until August 1917, is stated at L.T.180,000,000. Djavid Bey added that, if the war ends in August, the Turkish Public Debt will amount to L.T.330,000,000 in all. Of the various advances received from Germany, only the first instalment, L.T.5,000,000, was paid in gold at the time of the declaration of war. A part at any rate of this sum reached Constantinople before war was declared, and there can be little doubt that the sight of this gold had a powerful effect in inducing the Young Turls leaders to throw in their lot with Germany. Once this result had been obtained, the Tuiks have had to content themselves with German Treasury Bonds, which are deposited with the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt as security for the issue of paper money ; of this paper, according to Djavid Bey, L.T.79,000,000 worth has been emitted. This, Djavid Bey asserts, will be withdrawn from circulation in a period of eleven years from the conclusion of peace, and Germany has undertaken to guarantee the main tenance of Turkish paper money'after the war at the same rate as German paper money, and to send Turkey every year 3 2 million Liras in gold for the withdrawal of paper on the market. Although the different loans are said to bear interest at six per cent Diavid Bey makes the surprising statement that Germany has agreed not to charge any interest on them until all paper money has been withdrawn, that is to say for eleven years from conclusion of peace, if the above arrangement is adhered to.— 18.0 — The conclusions about the cost of the war in Turkey and its disJution among the Central Allies appear to be as follows m The cost of the war in Turkey, up to August, 1917, ( ^ ; e t T 180 000 000, of which L.T.142,000,000 have been IdvaledC Germany, and about L.T.10,000,000 by- Austria, while a sum of about L.T 28 000,000 represents internal floating debt of the Turkish government for arrears of salaries and military requisitions. ( i )\ TVip sum due to Germany for munitions is L.T.25 OOO.OOOand for railway transport L.T.20,000,000. The latter seems a very high figure and requires explanation. (31 Diavid Bey states that the new debt of L.T.180,000,000 ‘ represents L.T.5,000,000 monthly of military expenditure for the thirty-six months of war to August 1916, and that the present rate of expenditure is L. 1.7,000,000 monthly. It is to be noted that he reckons from August, 1914, the date of the general mobilization, whereas’ war was only declared at the beginning of November, 1914. The whole of Djavid Bey’s argument is, of course, based upon German victory and solvency, the prospect of which could not be e-timated very accurately by the I urkish Parliament. This body received the speech with great applause, and ordeied that copies should be placarded throughout the Empire. R W G. SYRIA. Palestine. Present Economic Conditions. The writer of the following Notes is the same Jewish agricultural expert who contributed the Report published in our No. 33, p. 504. Being unaware of this publication, he has traversed again some of the same ground in his second Report. Therefore we reproduce extracts only. He has not been back to Palestine in the interval, but has opened and maintained, with our cognizance, intelligence relations with co-religionists and others in the country. Imports. Palestine, being exclusively an agricultural country, used to depend entirely on foreign imports for all the mineral, industrial, manufactured, and colonial products essential to the life and welfare of its inhabitants. Whatever the condition of the stocksand warehouses at the beginning of the war—and this will be considered in another paragraph—the blockade must have fundamentally disturbed the life of the country. The blockade, as far as Palestine goes, is complete. Nothing comes in from the sea. Before the outbreak of the Arab revolt a certain amount of colonial goods, rice, sugar, coffee, etc., used to reach Damascus and Palestine from the Hejaz, by the weary and, one would have supposed, we prohibit caravan route. Now this scanty source of supply has been entirely closed also. Neither foreign, nor home-made goods worth mentioning are coming from the North by railway; Palestine has to live exclusively on its own individual resources. Unless one has seen the country with one’s own eyes, one cannot realize what variety of essentials, and all but essentials, are absolutely non-existent in Palestine now. Manchester goods, leather, coal, iron, cement, iron nails, matches, tea, cocoa, chocolate, sugar, lubricating oils, drugs, etc., etc., are entirely exhausted. People of wealth wear mere rags. Shoe-polish has been out of use for two years. One could fill pages with tragi comic illustrations of the awful state of things which this successful blockade has created. Exports. The blockade has also stopped all exports ; and this effect is another cause of ruin to the country. Most of the articles produced for export are either perishable or otherwise useless for the mere upkeep of the inhabitants. Palestine used to export a certain volume of cereals,_ but to import nearly their equivalent in flour, rice, etc. The failure of the imports in this line is hardly compensated by the surplus accumulated on account of the impossibility of export. On the other hand, the country exported oranges (about 2,000,000 boxes), wine, almonds, which have no market, or only a very reduced one in Palestine proper.. ... • ; Unfortunately, the production of oranges, wine, etc. became too specialized ; and one has now distressing opportunities for seeing, in Palestine, the unsound economic bases created by Uniculture. Wealthy proprietors of orange orchards see not only their crops decay, but their orchards deteriorate, for lack of funds to maintain them, while their people starve for mere bread ; whereas the poorer farmers, carrying on diversified farming, have bread, and the surplus of their crops is readily saleable in the local market. For these orange or wine-growers the conditions are the same as those which” in the Beirut region, have he en the initial cause of distress. This harbour exported annually over 20,000 000 francs of silk, while its total export was not more than 2o,0UU,UUU. As the silk finds no buyer nowadays there, the whole economic life of the region would have been shaken to its foundations by the blockade even without the brutal, murdering methods of the— 182 — Turks which have, however, hastened and emphasized the economic ruin. Issue of Paper-Money, . . The issue of Turkish paper-notes crowned the difficulties due to the tightening of the money market. As soon as the nossibility of the general introduction of Turk.sh paper-notes was hinted, the public, in Palestine, began to hoard up all he coins they could lay hands on. To make matters worse the first bundles of Turkish paper-money, which reached Palestine, consisted exclusively of L.T.5 notes. The exchange of a L. Pa note into five single notes cost at the start, 3/. ±he rail ot the paper-note was steady, reaching 27% of its face-value in March The following may serve as a striking proof how powerless the Turkish Government is, severe punishments notwithstanding, to enforce the circulation of the papei-notes . (Jerusalem Hebrew Daily, 44 Hatneruth Freedom, ^No. J2, 28 January, 1917. Official Notices : From official quarters we have received for publication, in our daily issue, the following official notice, issued by the Bureau of the Mutessarifiah : “It is known that the circulation of gold coins is strictly forbidden, and those who detain such coins have to present them for exchange into paper-notes, at the Treasury. But in order to provide for the needs of the public, and in order to get wheat at convenient prices, and in good condition, the following decisions have been adopted by the “ Committee for supplying wheat ” (a) Inasmuch as it is impossible to get wheat from the Arabs otherwise than by paying in gold, and owing to the pressing needs of the hour, it has been decided to change the whole capital of the “ Syndicate” into gold. (b) Inasmuch as the human sentiment of mercy forbids any man to starve his fellow man, when there is plenty of cereals in store, it is, therefore, the duty of everyone who possesses gold coins to apply to the Hon. Von. Grower (German Consul-General, apparently), President of the Executive of the “ Syndicate,” to have them exchanged for banknotes. (c) In conformity with the former Notice, which remains in force, the circulation of gold coins, as also the trade in coin exchange is forbidden to everyone except the “ Syndicate.” And whoever transgresses these orders, will be punished according to the regulations of the former Notice.” 2. Kanun-thani 1335 (= 26 January, 1917). The Turks try. to explain away the public’s lack of confidence in paper-notes, by the ignorance of a peasantry, used only to gold and silver coins. This is an arbitrary official lie.The peasants (crassly ignorant it is true), accept the paper-notes in which they have confidence. Over 30 years ago, at the beginning ot‘ the Jewish colonization movement in Palestine, when the financial success of the enterprise was far from being- assured, the young Jewish communities were faced by the difficulties arising from the scarcity of small change ; and they relieved the situation by issuing paper-notes of one and of a half piastre. The peasantry accepted these “ bans,' any amount of them, in payment for their products or their work, though the “ bons ” were not guaranteed by any bank deposit, bearing merely the seal of the Community. At the beginning of the war, the iknglo-Palestine Co., the Zionistic banking institution, issued numerous “ guaranteed cheques ” of 5, 10 and 20 francs each. They were accepted to any amount by the public, and for their full value, as readily as Government notes in other countries. In fact, these “guaranteed cheques” helped to relieve the money market in Palestine in the first months of the war. But the Government became jealous, and abolished them, threatening the A.P. Co. with proceedings for unlawfully issuing paper notes. This persecution not withstanding, people, even now, prefer the forbidden “guaranteed cheques ” to the Turkish paper notes, though severe penalties have been pronounced against those who are caught refusing the latter. Even now the notes of the Ottoman Bank, issued before the war, and guaranteed by its Board, are readily accepted, whereas the recent ones are discarded. The real reason why the Turkish notes are disliked is because people do not trust this Government. The catastrophe which followed the Turco-Bussian war (18^6-/7), when the Kaimeh lost its whole value, is still in everybody’s minds. A few fabulous fortunes were made then (the wealth of the Sursok family originated in this way), but the general public lost money, and 'thousands of powerful firms were ruined. That is wTiy nobody cares to accept the new Kainieh. As is to be expected from such a state of affairs, some usurers get rich, by gambling on the Exchange. One gets nowadays three or four.notes for one gold ponnd. Old debts are paid in depreciated notes. Another business also has developed, based on the good exchange which the Turkish paper note now obtains in Germany. Normally the L.T. is worth about 18 60 marks ; nowadays it fetches 22*24 marks. It pays', therefore, to transfer Turkish pounds to Berlin. The rate of exchange m Austrian crowns is still more advantageous—thirty-two to thirty- seven crowns for one pound. (/ • The circulation of currency is very limited in Palestine ; but as soon as a trustworthy Government comes in, hidden .corns will appear again, especially in the Nablus region, and to some extent, in the Gaza region.

The writer will not mention here those diseases, like malaria, from which the Palestinian population had to suffer even tn normal times, to a larger or smaller extent. He will mention here only those diseases which have recently spread fright ally, either on account of the insufficient hygienic measures of the Turkish army—though one must acknowledge that, in this special respect, the Turks have made conspicuous progress—or on account o£ the underfeeding of the population. Cholera, not unknown before the war, was spread through the army, mostly in the towns. The mortality was not very hb&lt;b and the disease was less prevalent in 1916 than in the previous year. The latest reports are that there is no cholera for the present. Hunger typhus has spread frightfully and has decimated the population as well as the army. Though typhus is supposed to abate during the summer, numerous cases happened in .Jerusalem, even in the summer of 1916. According to the latest reports (20 March), typhus is spreading again. In the Hebrew daily, “Hatheruth,” published in Jerusalem (14 February, 1917), we read that the hospital specially designated for typhus cases in Safed has been re-opened, Dr. Halim being in charge, and it has now about twenty typhus patients. Numerous cases of typhus are reported, from other sources, in Nazereth, Jerusalem, etc. Recurrent fever was very frequent in 1915 among the soldiers. In 1916 this disease was on the decrease in the army owing to the marvellous results obtained by the Salvarasan cure. Of this remedy there was plenty, and the military doctors were held personally responsible for any fatal issue due to this disease. But civilians could hardly afford to be treated by this cure, the injection costing L.T. 3. Smallpox seems to be widespread, judging by the orders for tens of thousands of vaccine doses ordered for Damascus from the Jewish Bacteriological Institute at Jerusalem. # Vaccination on a large scale is reported, in the above named Jerusalem Daily, at that city, as well as at Jaffa and elsewhere. * * “Orders were received, from 25 December, UUfi, to 21 January. 1917. for 10,000 doses for the Municipal Government in Damascus, and 20,000 more for the army in Damascus. “Hatheruth.” 51 January, 1917.Syphilis. Outside a few ancient places, like Caasarea, Palestine was rather free from venereal disease ; at any rate ex tremely few cases used to come to the notice of the doctors. It is, therefore, symptomatic, when one reads in the monthly report of the Serological Department of the Jewish Bacteriological Institute at Jerusalem, that during the months of January and February last, sixty-five and sixty-six Cases of syphilis were submitted to the Wasserman test with thirty-two and thirty-four positive results. This is a moderate number for such a' large population as Jerusalem ; but since only the better people 'apply at the Institute, these figures are rather striking evidence of a new addition to the scourges due to the Turkish army. : Drugs. Pharmacies have been sacked and drugs wasted. No wonder, therefore, that most drugs are not to be procured now at any price. On the other hand, one is surprised to learn that, with the interested complicity of the Turkish doctors, certain drugs can still be obtained. Thus, quinine is still offered at a relatively moderate price of LT.12 to LT.lo in notes, corresponding to about LT.4 gold. Crystallized iodine fetches the same price, which is out of proportion. Cotton and rubber, for medicinal purposes, are absolutely unprocurable. Castor oil has not been emplo) T ed for the last two years. On the other hand, we have reports from military doctors, up to March 14 last, complaining that their pharmacy chests have been empty for months, and that, except some quinine, they can prescribe nothing for their patients. Commerce. The country is dying slowly ; there is no trade left. Reports from Haifa, Nazareth, Tiberias, Nablus, Jerusalem, Jaffa, etc. invariably state that the shops and stores are not only shut, but empty, and that even their doors have been removed. Whatever exchange of products still goes on is done secretly from fear both of robbery by the Authorities and the penalties for the low exchange at which the notes are accepted. The best proof how low commerce is, is to be found in the fact that officers stationed in Jerusalem are reported to complain of lack of petroleum and sugar. Thanks to the superior skill of Ali Rushan Bey in squeezing out of the people the last that the}' have, the officers in garrison at Jerusalem used to be well provided, paying for the products they got at normal pre-war prices. If Ali Rushan Bey can find nothing more, it proves that really nothing has been left. It may be the reason why he has been nominated President of the Martial Court of Jerusalem. There is no more game in his old field, for a man of his ability. Bedel. ' - ■ : : For the relatively moderate sum of 50 Napoleons a man, liable to military service, could free himself for the , whole duration of the war, no matter how long it. lasted. He- could186 be either enlisted or invited to Pav ' tax, only i£ there wer « a a ' eontracf er.tered upon by the of at least lo days, ^ the T ‘ urks have bedel-paying man wi i Seeing that this war was learned tne scrap 1 P . j methods of making the going to be a long one thej devned tm « hich rnlrsiwf-si* 18 - ’“''La-*' • &lt; ' , l f&gt; ■. **' «&lt; opposition irom Talaat, Enver succeeded m framing a^nevv law abolishing the “ bedel ’ entirely. But, as usual with the Turks, the law if so framed that a loop-hole can be d|Scoveted ,f the proper “ bakshish ” is paid to the officials. Aftei the bedel was finally abolished a way of escaping the law was provided, at least within the sphere of action of the H . Anm. There is no “ bedel ” any more, but by paying a definite war-contribution, one can be freed from military service. Ibis war-contribution is paid in kind. Commodities have to be forwarded to certain appointed stores ; the exemptee has to provide the sacks or bags for the commodities. There is not a single sack to be found m the country, and people are making bags of old skirts, rugs, curtains, etc., the heaped up stores presenting the wildest motley of colours and stuffs. The war-contribution, entitling a man to one year’s exemption from military service, can be paid in the following kinds, and amounts :— either: 4,000 Kgs of wheat or : 4,350 „ ,, barley 4.000 „ ,, potatoes 5,050 „ „ lentils 3.200 „ „ chick peas 3,220 „ „ bourgul (crashed wheat) 4.200 „ ,, maize (Indian corn) 4,300 ,, ,, durrha 8.000 „ „ ? A glance at the list will suffice to show the lack of proportion in the different products. Potatoes, for instance, were at all times rather a luxury in Palestine. Nowadays, after the locust invasion and the impossibility of the introduction of new seed potatoes, there are probably not 4,000 Kgs of potatoes in the whole country. Prospects of the Coming Crop. Knowing, as we do, that all able-bodied men are in the Army, and that only old men and children are left to drive the plough ; knowing too that there are practically no animals left, either through requisitions, or through the terrible mortality among animals, following the lack of pasture due to the locust invasion ; knowing that very few people could afford to keepseeds in the face of the famine—we shall not expect to hear that there has been milch ploughing or sowing this year in Palestine. In fact the reports show that most of the land is left bare, and that the preparation of it has everywhere been deficient. The winter crop depend on the amount and distribution of rain. The amount of rain has been satisfactory ; but the distribution of precipitation has been most unfortunate, as can be judged from the following figures : — 1916. 1917. Oct. Nov. Dec. Jan. Feb. Total. Rain in mm. : P5 34 - 0 75‘5 245*5 122*0 478*5 The first recorded rain fell on the 29th of October. 34 mm. of November rain fell between the 3rd and 6th of the month. The next rain came only on the 11th of December, or after an interval of five weeks. As the November rains were not sufficient to wet the ground to the required depth, sowing had to be postponed till more rain came in December. The amount of precipitation in this month was more than enough, but it fell unfortunately in 14 days, from the 11th to the 31st, so that little ploughing or sowing could be done during that month, the most important for these operations. During the month of January more than enough rain came, in torrential showers of 34, 38*5 and 47*5 mm. at a time (which must have caused a good deal of erosion), and at too short intervals : 135*5 mm. from the 1st to the 5th of January, 34*5 mm. during the 10th and 11th of the month, 42*5 mm. from the 20th to the 23rd, and finally 33 mm. from the 27th to the 31st. Very little sowing, under favourable conditions, could be done during that month. On the other hand, the temperatures were too low and the ground was too much soaked for the rapid growth of the early sowings, of which much must have been washed away, and there were no seeds to sow a second time. In February there were again 13 days of rain, which must have handicapped the field work. This defective distribution of rain is felt especially in years like the current one when there are few hands and animals. The most recent reports state that some people still continued sowing wheat at the end of February. Nothing can be expected of such late sowing. The prospects of the coming harvest of cereals theiefoie, can be only very poor indeed. The hot winds we experienced here in -March and early in April have certainly been felt in Palestine too, and must have done damage. The abundance of rain last winter promises a good summer crop, but this, at its best cannot feed the country, and requires for its success more hand labour and care than the people can afford, under the present circumstances.notesi SECRET.

It is agreed chat neither the nomination nor the establish ment ot‘ a Caliph is^ any business of a Christian Power ; but we are virtually committed, by a message sent through the Emir of Mecca to the Arab people (August 30, 1915), to 'approve” :m Arab Caliphate, whenever established by Arabs in common. VChen that message was framed, it was, perhaps, not realized that diplomatic, or any official, u approval ” of a Caliph as such by a Christian Power would be a novelty. Has any Ottoman Sultan been addressed by a British Chancery as Caliph ” or u Prince of the Faithful ” or other such title ? Elizabeth, or her ministers, styled Sultan Suleiman, Defensor Fidei,” when his help was being solicited against Philip of Spain ; but, if the Protestant faith was not intended, the title was probably inserted merely as a convention appropriate in addressing so great a sovereign. Our official acknowledgement of Caliphs as such has never gone much beyond the negative attitude adopted by the Government of India, which does not interfere with the practice of praying for the Ottoman Sultan in the Khutba , even when a state of war exists between him and ourselves. Nor, in the assurances given to the Sultan of Egypt, at the time of the establishment of our Protectorate, did we really make any new departure, though, in a letter from Sir Milne Cheetham to the Sultan, allusion was made to the Ottoman Caliphate as not affected by our action in a country no longer politically con nected with Constantinople. We are, however, almost certainly destined to be asked sooner or later to signify our approval” by some official action more posi tive than we have ever taken hitherto in regard to the Caliphate. If formally approached by a new Caliph, we could hardly, for example, be at one and the same time “approving” his Caliphate and continuing to suffer Indian Moslems to pray publicly for an Ottoman Caliph. Yet that such a dilemma may arise is not out of the question. There has often been more than one Caliph (there are, at least, two at present), and, even in sadly reduced circumstances, the Ottoman Sultan may continue to commend himself to many Moslems by force of tradition and habit, more than a new Caliph not particularly powerful and suspected of dependence on Christendom. The only possible justification of that negative attitude of ours in India and elsewhere resides in our official pre tence that the Caliphate is only a spiritual headship, no longer implying temporal dominion over Moslems in general. This view lies obscurely behind the reference in Sir Milne Cheetham’s letter quoted above, and is not inconsistent with any of the subsequent references to the Caliphate which occurred in official communications from Lord Kitchener and Sir Henry1 V nf Mecca. A pretence, in&lt;iee&lt;l, it is—a McMahon to the him - affect facts, but only our sturdy consciou.fict.ou It does.^ ()f , ht th imperial rektioii «&gt; ■ • , e , B pi r itual headship o{ Imamate, uot the Cagate, a was both tempera [slam i.that the Cahphate^ ^ , livorced from temporal and spiritual, and I a- - a j- j himself 'or by s&lt;,me great dom nion held e.the '.y ^e ^ ^ im&lt;) that it is Moslem sovereign not on l y w ith temporal dominion still associated by , but with a right and an aspiration actually enjoyed h.) ^ M in the fulness of time, to temporal dom , , 0I) Mamie history, law and maitict'^r Christian Snouck-Hurgronje, Professor of Arabic at practic , re8 i(lent in Mecca for several months, wrote last Leiden, &lt;iin 1 one ; ' , u A W year ’^nXrity of a Khalif over its Mohammedan ^tt^st'AUuthority.of a pope of the Moslem Church but in simple ignorance is feeding political programmes, which ’however vL^always. have the power, of stirring Mohammedan masses to confusion and excitement. The problem that will he set before us, if an Arab Caliphate is established, is how to “approve” an institution which implies a claim inconsistent with our sovereignty, without admitting that claim. It can only lie solved by persevering wdh the sturdy official pretence already mentioned. By bating explicitly as our official view, in our terms of 1 approval, we shall, in a sense, remove it from the region of pretence to that of relative reality. Though Moslems as a whole do not regard a Caliph as analogous to a Pope, it is perfectly reasonable lor us to say that we, for our part, do so regard him ; i.e., m his relation to our Moslem subjects and those of our Allies and. indeed, everywhere outside his own realm, he has, qua Caliph, a spiritual position only. Even Moslems have proposed that such should be his position. One of the earliest items m the O.t.r. programme was the divorce of Church fiom State, y t e detachment of the Caliphate from the Sultanate^ and its committal to some Sherif (Ali Haidar, the present v&gt; Pretender to the Emirate of Mecca, was suggested), who would live in a small guaranteed Vatican reservation, 1 perhaps near Damascus. The idea, therefore, is not quite unknown, ^ nor necessarily inacceptable, by Moslems. [See below, p. 193, for an indication that this idea has not been forgotten by the C.U.P.] To adopt it hardily and openly as our vieyv of the Caliphate to-day seems the only course, which will enable us to make good our under takings, and at the same time maintain common consistency and self-respect. The general consent of the Arabs, however, will not easily he accorded to any new Caliph unless and until he has proved himself conspicuously powerful without Christian help ; an ‘)'' should an Ottoman Sultan survive, non-Arab Moslems will be slow to transfer their allegiance, except to some prince deemedlikely to increase tin* Dar el-Islam. This last consideration, however, is not germane. We are pledged to consider the wishes of the Arabs alone, so far as their Caliphate is concerned. D. G. H. Hejaz. Intelligence. One of our patrol ships paid a visit to Akaba on April 20, and put a party on shore to attack the post of from sixty to eighty Turks, who were entrenched there. Part of their trenches was taken without loss to ourselves, and the enemy, leaving two dead and eleven prisoners, withdrew to the hills. Two boats, a large one, and a small one, recently brought down overland, were destroyed or captured, and some ten mines were taken out of the sea : but no store of mines was discovered on shore. A report, transmitted through Switzerland, and given here for what it is worth, states that Fakhri Pasha has informed his Government that, unless he can be re-supplied with ammunition, he must surrender Medina. From similar secondary sources come indications that the advisers of the C.U.P., while not ceasing to promote Neo-Turanian propaganda, are more disposed than they were to try to court the Arabs and keep control of Islam. They are said to be organizing, in concert with the Germans, an anti-British movement amongst Arabs: and King Husein, on being advised of this report by us, was disposed to credit it, and improved the occasion by remarking that, bad and u disorderly as Turks and Germans'may be, they still understand that the true basis of Islam is Arab ! We have further been informed, though from a doubtful source, that the Turks are prepared to offer King Husein a spiritual Caliphate without temporal power. If there is anything in this report, it indicates a return by the O.U.P. to its earliest programme, mentioned on p. 192. King Husein is very unlikely to look at such a proposal, but we have not yet heard any comments of his on the report. The Muadhdham station affair took place on April 14. I he detachment sent by Feisal numbered about 1,000 Arabs and a few Turkish soldier-deserters, with two mountain guns, two machine guns and an automatic gun. The line was cut in five places between stations, from Khaims to Oar el-Hamra, and che station buildings and fort of Muadhdham were attacked ; but though the desuitorv fight lasted some hours no impression was made. The Bedouins kept well away under cover as soon as they heard machine-guns begin to rattle, and only Yuzbashi Malud, a Baghdadi, who was wounded twice, with a lew trained men ever attacked.

Before the attack took place, Colonel Newcombe and a party of Ageyl and Bishawa went north of Muadhdham station to cut the railway and telegraph lines. From Colonel Newcombe s report it is seen that he had considerable difficulty m gett.ngthc narties with him to attend to any orders. However, htially he began blowing up the line at kilo. 798, and although about 161 charges were fired, lie reports very little real damage was done to — 194 — been left behind, in the end hicb had uiiaceoi . a | 088 G f ten dea&lt; He then moved south to Dizad, where there were some dozen Turks in a fort. Nobody could be persuaded to take on the attack of this fort, the fall of which could have been easily accomplished if his men had done what they were told. However, they preferred the less dangerous work of blowing up the line, and, when he found them again, were at kilo. 809 on demolition work. Between kilos. 809 and 814, the telegraph line was cut twice between poles, and he estimated that, on the whole, fifty rails were damaged at kilo. 798, and the telegraph line was cut in one place, and about twenty rails and the telegraph line were cut for four kilometres between kilos. 809 and 814. The chief point in Colonel Newcombe’s report emphasizes the extraordinary lack of discipline shown by the untrained Bedouin, and their total disregard of any orders, even a Sherif’s, and the good work, under very trying conditions, of the disciplined troops. Transport and commissariat arrangements he reports as poor. Sherif Feisal is still at Wejh, but practically all his available men and guns are operating on the railway line. Abdullah remains in Wadi A is, and reports that he is cutting the railway nightly. Ali and Zeid are reported to have abandoned their siege of Bir el-Mashi. Ali lias taken up positions on the Sultani road and near Muheit station to operate against the railway. Zeid remains to watch Bir el-Mashi. tinformation front Prisoners. Reports trom prisoners recently captured give a certain amount of information about the Hejaz Railway; but their statements about the number of trains running are very doubtful, in view of the known shortage of engines. There are reported to be thirty-five regular soldiers at Abu Taka, which is defended by three small blockhouses, holding nine to ten men each. The garrison of Medain Salih is reported to be about 400, under Mustafa Munir Eff. Medain Salih is also protected by blockhouses. A gun-pit was reported at Medain Salih, but no gun had been seen. One prisoner stated that the only stations on the line which have a water supply, between Medain Salih and Tebuk, are el-Muadhdham and Qalat el-Akhdar. Prisoners reported that, up till the end of March, two or three trains passed each way (ride note at the beginning). Trains from Medina were full of civilian inhabitants and a certain amount of soldiers, but in no sense could be called troop-trains. Trains from the north bring rations, most of which are reported to be for the Arabs, and particularly for Ibn Rashid. Sheikh Shehab of the Fuqara and Sheikh Suleiman Rufadah Pasha are also known to receive rations. Trains sometimes had armoured trucks, but apparently very few trains were supplied with an escort. At one time there 'was a big reserve of rails at Toweira, but latterly these have been moved north to Tebuk, whence, it was believed, a light line w T as contemplated to Uweini, in order to bring fuel. An engine was also reported to have run off the line and been destroyed during the recent rains. Information about aeroplanes was vague. An aerodrome was reported to have been prepared at Medain Salih, but no machines had been sent, though some new ones were expected from the north.Yemen.

The fact proves that el-Sar, or his emissary, must have come /■IIlia lnr&gt;lr wifli InTlfil * l, The Hashid wa Bekil are pure mercenaries, who swarm to the standard of the biggest briber. They are fickle to a degree. It is a common practice for sept to leave sept and join the man with the largest purse. It is hardly possible for one man to enlist the Hashid wa Bekil in their entirety. These tribesmen were originally in the pay of the imam, who, being stingy, got Izzet Pasha, when Turkey was fighting Italy, to pay not only his (the Imam’s) stipend, but that of these refractory tribesmenof his. Some of the Hashid wa Bekil dissapproved of the Imam’s wooing the Turks, and left him to start an intrigue with the anti-Turk Idrisi. NTasir Mabkhut el-Ahmar was one of the leading Hashid who wrote to Idrisi, and quite recently Seyyid Yahya, who was in Jizan, reported that Haj Masud el-Bariki (Hashid), together with, (of the Bekil), Salih Dugheish, principal Sheikh of the Beni Harith, and Sheikh Ibrahim ibn Ali of Rauda, were in Jizan, plotting to win Idrisi’s support. “To complicate matters still further, this Seyyid Yahya carried certain proposals from the King of the Hejaz to the Hashid wa Bekil, and was able to secure letters from various sheikhs of the Hashid wa Bekil, in which they offer their services to King Husein. The avowed object is to oust the Turks, but the conditions formulated include money, arms and ammunition, and various other important details of requirements, now and after the war. The principal signatories are Ali Husein el-Bariki, Ahmed ibn Yahya ibn Fara, Ali ibn Mukbil Abu Said, Haj Masud ibn Aid el-Bariki, all of Hashid, and various Bekil Sheikhs. • t fdrisi has sent to our Resident an original letter to himself from the Bekil Sheikh, Yahya ibn Yahya el-Shaif. This Sheikh is of importance and lives at Zahir. His daughter was given in marriage to the Hashid Sheikh, Ahmed \ ahya fara. The letter proves the writer to be a prime braggart. “There is, then, utter chaos reigning, since three principal rulers, the Imam, Idrisi and the King of the Hejaz are tiying their hardest to win over these mercenaries, who, if united, form the * creme de la creme ’ of the warriors of Yemen ; but divided they will effect practically nothing—jm* energy dissipated. “It is very important for us to gain the adherence of the Imam Yahya to our cause. This the Idrisi would checkmate, for he does*not wish his rival to come within the purview of our friendship, lest his own claims south of Loheiya, which are very nebulous, go by the board. He claims the territories held in '1848 by Sherif Husein of Abu Ansh, and these included tracts as far south as Mokha. ? “ It stands to reason, with all this wire-pulling, that Idrisi s chances of enlisting the Hashid wa Bekil to any appreciable or useful extent, are very small ; and ^therefore oui oftei Hiroug him to the Hashid wa Bakil of £&lt;,000 per mensem loi 5,00( warriors would be so much money thrown into the sea : especially since the latest conditions formulated by ehShaff (Bekil) to the Idrisi are so grasping and so fai m excess of what this Residency recommended, and the Government has sanctioned. . . “There was in my opinion an initial error ronnmttedm tampering' with the Hashid wa Bekil ; tor manifestly we can haTno fontrol over them once they enter the nor “'Id we guarantee their steering clear ot the Imam Yahya, even, , , 1 r Q , Up has UP to date. Nothing easier for the latter held aloot, as Q £ hostility by the Imam, and [drisi than to assert an o ^ t his distance. It is the Imam as difficult lor us to ( ^pr tronoe st potential foe, or friend, who, after this war. will wi ll not, I believe, and to attempt ^ 'ay hts taibe, ^ Turks [£ he di(i result in getting h * I H shid wa fiekil alienated, with ga^'2 a On the top of all this, as I have said above, we see the . i. i u* ^pwitl Yahva intriguing on behalf of the edHy'ng speckle ol^eyyid tahy^ ^ a kind i y welcome from Idrisi, who rightly scented self-interest in YahWs Plans and vetoed his proposal to go inland. Yahya accordingly plotted, and got letters from certain Hasted wa Bekif Sheikhs, over Idrisi’s head and unknown to Idrisi. Idrisi so far as this Residency is aware, has not discovered this i 'ounter-plottin &lt;r. If he did so, his relations with Aden would be less cordial, 'since Yahya travelled up to -Tizan trom Aden and would be considered partly our spokesman, or acting with om approval. “ As regards the Hashid tribesmen, it will not be easy for Idrisi to secure them. Nasir Nabkhut has^ influence, but no Arab sheikh can-command more than a nominal allegiance from his tribesmen. Sheharah, the Imam’s chief residence, ^ situated in the midst of Hashid territory, and here the Imam s influence is paramount, whatever Nasir may say to the contrary. Nasir is a weathercock, and will desert Idrisi when he finds it convenient to draw more from another source. It is unreasonable to blame the Imam, as Idrisi did, when he stated that despite his treaty with the Turks, it was easy for the Imani to break his pledge, and Allah would provide an opening ! The Imam is honourable, as Arabs go, and again, his interests tell him that, removed as he is far inland, it is a very precarious venture tor him to oppose the Turks, except covertly ; whereas Idrisi, who for some time past has been anti-lurk, lives near the sea-board, and, if attacked, can rely on British warships to defend These two rulers are placed in very different situations. My sympathies go rather with the Imam, whose forbears have stoutly disputed with the Turks the mastery of the Yemen. u The wording of the Resident’s letter to Idrisi, while eliminating every possible occasion for Idrisi’s charging us with a change of policy, will force him to reconsider the recruiting ol these Hashid wa Bekil in all its bearings, and will throw on him the onus of securing them on the conditions allowed by Government. “ In the meantime there remains a slight hope of our securing the Imam’s entrance into the field. Little will be gained byre-approaching him, it he declines to accept the present invitation ; hut if he elects still to hold aloof, his sitting on the fence is not without its advantages, though these are secondary. If, then, the Idrisi cannot enlist those mercenaries, we shall not only be saved a useless expenditure of cash, but shall be spared the spectacle of a congeries of tribesmen split up into different camps, allured by varying offers, and presenting no solid opposition to the Turks. “ Sheikh Ahmed Musa id-Allaui, of Sabah, is at heart a Zeidi and pro-imam. He carried our last letters to the Imam and brought a reply, and the letter from El-Dumein. I employed this Sheikh largely from 1904-1907, and here, in Aden, since 1910. He is a ‘ trimmer,’ hut at this juncture anxious to oust the Turks. His report, brought back from Sudah, the Imam’s present residence, shows that the Imam at heart does see occasion to break away from the Turks. El- Dumein is one of the best; of the Imam’s lieutenants. He visited Aden before the war and carried verbal messages from the Sherif of Mecca to the Imam. He will be able, if plied with e suitable douceur, to influence the Imam, and we can further play on the avarice of Abdallah ibn Ibrahim, the Imam’s confidant and chief minister. Both men will expect presents ; for the Arab lives up to his saw regarding the omnipotence of cash, which is “the. tongue of the eloquent and the strong arm of the fighter.” “ If we can secure the Imam Yahya. we shall put Idrisi in his proper place, and secure ourselves from much acrimonious correspondence and serious trouble with the Imam—if the Turks leave the Yemen-—and further, damage very greatly in the Yemen' the prestige of the Turks, who, if the Imam seceded, would have their retreat cut off. “ We need not, however, expect to see any two Arabian chiefs co-operating against the Turks. They will never do more than play each for himself. We shall never enjoy the spectacle of ‘the two kings smelling at one nosegay.’ Our diplomacy will be successful, if we can induce each to move on his own territory for a common object. “ Another letter from Idrisi is just to hand. He wants^ the Hashid wa Bakil to raid the Tihamah down to Sheikh vSaid. where he asserts naively that the Imam Yahya has no interests. He admits that the demands of the Hashid wa. Bakil will be high. He does not much care if these tribesmen are enlisted or not, so far as his own territories are concerned, but says the^ would prove very useful for the broader objective. He does not appear to have so far offered any monetary conditions to the Hashid wa Bakil. “ One point has not been adequately considered heretofore. 1 refer to the very easy transfusion of prejudices between Shafi and Zeidi creeds in the Yemen. Many of our hinterland proteges lean towards the Imam, and more so since the expulsion of the Turks from the Yemen is now practicable.■Hi — 200 — ABYSSINIA. Somali Frontier. • Ti &lt; 1 mimissioner tor British Somaliland, who went up to The Comnntv coronation, took occasion to draw the Adis Abeba to ^ ^ Government to the unsatisfactory atte,t.on pRas Taffian m,d Somal i lanc , p r otectomte Tk iild-standing M ol atoinistering these provinces has been aggravated lately by chaos in Xe Harrar Province and Lij Vasu’s Moslem intrigues. The Commissioner writes: “ With an administrative post at Hargeisa we control the o imaH Lhos rieht up to the frontier, and they are to-day well- ordered and 'peaceable. But across the border, in the Abyssinian sphere there is neither control nor security of life and jn-operty. Were ’we able to coniine our people within our territory the solution would lie in our own hands. We could establish tribal posts, as we have done with a good measure ot success on the dervish front, and thus preserve the British tribes from aggression from outside. But our frontier with Abyssinia, which runs through the middle of the bomah country, leaves us without adequate water and grazing. To both peoples, certainly, the right of free grazing on either side of the border is preserved ; but, in practice, the situation resolves itself into this : that whole sections of our tribes ha ve to emigrate m to the Abyssinian sphere and live there with their tlocks and heids toi six months in the year in pursuit of water and pasturage ; while there is no neceseity for the Abyssinian Somali tribes to come into our territory at all, except for purposes ol trade, and when they will. In the absence of any control on the other side oi the' line it follows that, when our people are looted (and they frequently are), there is no redress obtainable except by means of reprisals : and if raiding and counter-raiding are allowed to run their course, they can only, in the end,^ lead to complete disorder and anarchy along the whole frontier.” The Commissioner goes on to point out how the Abyssinian Government has failed to fulfil its treaty obligations to administer and deal fairly with these Somalis, there not being- one Abyssinian officer or soldier now in all the Ogaden territory. Massacres of Moslems by Abyssinian soldiery in the Harrar Province have embittered these Somalis, who now pray for the return of Lij Yasu. The latter, the Commissioner thinks, might possibly kindle a great blaze in all the country from the Culf of Aden to Juba. Meanwhile, no steps are being taken to capture him. The Commissioner arrived at no satisfactory understanding at Adis Abeda.NOTES. Basin of Lower Wadi Uamdh. Captain Ij. Hoyle, M.O., whose competence in Arabic, and power of gaining Bedouin confidence are well known, spent some days in the country behind Wejh in March last. He was sent up to search for landing grounds for the B.F.C., and went as far in as Jeyadah, on the southern el-Ala road, and Ugla (Akila) on the Medina road. He reports, that, though there is scarcity of accessible and good water, the country in general is surprisingly well-wooded, and full of game, in the wadis are guinea-fowl and red-legged partridge ; the true ring-dove is common, and so is the blue rock-pigeon. Dorcas and Coder’s gazelle were seen, as well as ibex, hyama, and a small jackal. Captain Hoyle came on tracks of a leopard, and heard much of an animal, probably a wolf or wild dog, which will attack a camel alone and pull it down. The H.F.C. observers estimate the hills, two day’s journey inland from Wejh (e.g. Jebels Chalab and Warid), to rise to 5,000 feet, and the railway to be more distant from the coast than our maps represent it. (Lieut. Carland, on the other hand, thought it, at Toweira, about twenty miles nearer to the coast than it is charted.) Jeyadah is reckoned by Bedouins half-way between Bir Abu A jaj and the railway ; el-Ala is reached, according to them in one and a half day’s easy going from Jeyadah. At his first night halt on the outgoing-journey from Wejh, between Wadi Miya and Seil Abu Ajaj, Captain Hoyle found the rifle-pits made by the u Emden ” party on their march up to el-Ala in May 1915. Currency in Iiddah. Mr. L. G. Houssin, of the Ministry of Finance, Cairo, kindly communicates notes of a conversation with Mr. Georges Raad. Controller of the Imperial Ottoman Bank, Jiddah Branch. The most interesting item of information concerns Turkish silver money, which Mr. Raad says has not depreciated at the same rate as gold. A mejidieh now exchanges for 16*6 gold piastres, a depreciation of only about 10 per cent on the pre-war rate : but small currency, which is plentiful enough, has fallen about 10 per cent more than the large silver. No Turkish notes are in circulation in Jiddah, but Egyptian notes are accepted at about per cent discount. Merchants generally contrive to make about 2^ per cent between the rates at which they receive and pay out money. When the mejidieh was fixed by the Hejaz Government at an arbitrary rate of 1 1 piastres, the&gt; paid then dues in this coin ; subsequently the rate was lowered to lb piastres, and it paid them better to settle in gold. Rupees circulate at about the same discount as in India, i.e. you may °- e t op to 16J rupees for the pound sterling. Owing to the number of counterfeit mejidiehs in circulation, containing often as much silver as the genuine coins, the HejazGovernment has declared that all those ■'closely resembling L real article are to he accepted as currency. Aden Hinterland. Under date April 9. Aden sends reports which indicate that the revolt on the Yusutyin frontier, extending south-west from Taiz for some forty miles, has given, and is giving. Ah Said Pasha a good deal of trouble. In one fight the Turks are said to have had some thirty casualties; and by sending successive detachments northwards, they have almost denuded Lahej ol troops. Gun and rifle ammunition has also been sent north m considerable quantities. This Yusuf yin revolt has now been going on for some two months The main combatants are tribal; but the Turks have been helping Nasir Muqbil and his Hajariyah and Jebel Habashi levies. The Yusufyin have now asked for monetary assistance from us to enable them to continue in the held, and a certain orant has been made by Aden. We are not, however, at present trying to organize a wider-spread revolt, owing to difficulties ol communication with more distant tribes, and tin expediency of leaving negotiations with some of these, e.cj. the bekil, in the hands of Idrisi. But several chiefs appear to be out against the Turks, e.g. Kaid Rajeb of Baadan, who has sent his brother Hassan with .500 men to help Hassan Raid Abu has of the Khaulan et-Tawal tribe, and Seyyid Ahmed of Taiz. We hear also of another chief, Hassan Mohammed el-Dueis, as an ally of Raid hajeb ; he claims to have been supplied with ammunition by the Imam Yahya. Yemen. Money is getting scarce in the Ottoman Treasury at Sanaa, if a report sent by the Abdali Sultan’s confidential correspondent at Lahej be true, to the effect that the 5 ali has warned All Said Pasha of his inability to send him any more cash for salaries, etc. Those at Lahej, said the Vnli, must henceforth live off the country. A chief of the Khaulan et-Tawal has reported to Aden that the people of Yemen are displeased with the Turks, and pray God they he removed. Afghan Opinion and Baghdad. In Kabul, we are informed, the news of Baghdad was received very quickly, and the bazaars explained it by a story that the Turks had been drawn awav to Kerbela by a feint, leaving Baghdad to be occupied without opposition. (The same bazaar credited Enver with the deposition of the Tzar !) At the same time the news is said to have scotched the Turco- German party at Kabul, and to have caused deep depression in the higher circles. The Amir betook himself to Laghman with it is said, the pick of his harem ladies, to obtain relief frompessimistic talk in the capital, occasioned by a sense of the military and political weakness and the general backwardness of the Moslem world. I bn Rashid and the Hash. In the recent fighting between Ibn Rashid and the Beni Salim Harb, who belong to Abdullah’s force, we are informed from Mecca that Ibn Rashid, who was the aggressor, lost 200 mares, and that two of the principal Abdah Sheikhs, Aqab ibn- Ajil (grand-uncle of Ibn Rashid) and Ibn Nahaiyir (?), were killed. An Ajman chief is also reported killed, but Ins name has so suffered in transmission that we do not know whether he is one of the Hithleins or not. His individual name was perhaps Mutluq.notes.SECRET. Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, May 13, 1917. No. 50. SUMMARY. ARABIA — Hejaz («) Intelligence. (/&gt;) Raids on the Railway.

There has not been much military information this week. The Turks still hold Bir el-Mashi in force, and Fakhri Pasha himself has been there. Medina is said to have more sick than sound soldiers in it. So far as we know, it has not been reinforced, re-victualled, nor in any way relieved. Abdullah’s bands continue to operate on the southern section of the line, and the damage the)’ do is reported often not repaired for three or four days. Further temporary destruction has been effected between Oar el-Hamra and Moadhdham, and raiders have apparently been operating also still further north, in the Tebuk district. The Huweitat are reported to be fighting with two sections of the Beni Atiyah, which have, apparently, not joined the revolt ; and the same report mentioned fighting also between the Turks and the Sibaa Anazeh and Hadidin of Hamah at a point which is probably ftanta on the Homs- Hamah railway, near a bridge .by which the latter crosses the Orontes. Sir Mark Sykes, accompanied by Colonel Leachman, has visited Weih and Jeddah. At the former, on May 3, he saw Sidi Feisal ; at the latter, on May 5, King Husem. He reports the results of both interviews to be satisfactory, inasmuch as the iiejaz leaders have been brought to understand that they have to with an indivisible Entente ; that, under whatever overlord, an enlightened progressive regime must be established m Syria ; and that certain districts of the latter, whmh present peculiar difficulties, must remain under special tutelage m any event. Raids on the Railway. T —Abu Markka to Abu el-Naam. From March lo to March 26 I stayed in Sidi Abdullah’s camp On Monday, March 26, wo started off at Z.oO a.m. foi railway at Abu el-Naam. With me were Shen Fauzan (Hurith Emir of el-Modhiq), Sherd Suleima (Abdilla), Sidi Raho Algerian officer in French service) and Mohammed 1 r? AW / T.mplnohl We were joined shortly by Mufaddhl, a ^ e ^^^ te b r ° U1 ^t o’lo^a^^we^crossed^the ri^i^bank of thewadh Me to the' left, and came out of the narrows on to a broadplain formed by the confluence of the wadis from right to left. Just in front of us was Bir el-Amn, about twenty feet deep; water slightly brackish, but abundant. The Mis °n the right, beyond the bend of the wadi, are high. Af 10.40 a.m we halted under a great sidr tree, and spent the mid-day there. Wadi Ais proved almost luxuriant with its thorn trees and grass. There was a cool east wind, and the valley was full of white butterflies and the scents of flowers. We mounted again at 3.40 p.m., and at 3.o0 p.m. reached an old wall, which deflects the stream of the wadi to its left bank, and guards an earth terrace, about five feet high, on its south side, against floods. The wall is constructed of chosen unhewn blocks, about a foot square each, and tolerably coursed. It is about a mile and a half long, and fairly solid. Its present Greatest height is about four feet, but it must go down some considerable depth below the wadi bed, to withstand the floods. In the terrace, about 400 yards wide, partitioned off by the wall, are remains of fields, house-foundations, and a large sunk water- basin, of correct masonry. At 4.10 p.m. we left Wadi Ais, which turned off northwards on our left towards Murabba. We went up-a narrow valley into Jebel Serd. At 4.45 p.m. a valley came in on the right ; at 5.5 p.m. we reached an easy watershed and crossed the heads of a valley flowing north to Wadi Ais. At 5.15 p.m. we crossed a second watershed, also easy, and went down a small valley into W. Serun at 5.25 p.m. We camped here for the night, watering from Gfhadir Seriam (Moeit Hefna), ten minutes awav in the foothills east of us. Tuesday, March 27. Started at 5.35 a.m. and crossed El-Mauggad to the north end of J. Serd, and went up and down its first spur by a very steep, sharp path (there is a much better road for guns, ten minutes south of our road, over J. Serd.) This took us down into a deep wadi, which we crossed, and thence over a second wadi (Seil el-Howeiti) and a low divide, giving on a side valley, up which we wound to another steep saddle at 7.3 a.m., and a nasty descent into a long rough narrow valley leading down into Wadi Turaa, which enters Hamdh opposite the mouth of W. Tubja. We reached this W. Turaa at 7.45 a.m., and camped at 8.25 a.m. near Bir Fueir. W. Turaa is a plain, bearing north-west, full of trees, and grass, with a sandy surface, much cut up with sells. One of these had filled in the well this year, but waterpools exist in plenty in the hills, so that the many tents in the valley have no lack of water. Wadi Turaa is the best way down to Wadi Yambo, and lias el-Fura (Kheif Husein) is about two days camel from here. 1 he flat-topped straight-sided hills on the north bank of the valley are J. ITn Rutba. The valley is Urwa dira. \\ e started again at 4.20 p.m. and at 5.5 p.m. turned 60 up a valley. At 5.20 p.m. about 120° and at 5.30 p.m. 60° agam, up the upper course of W. Turaa, a broad smoothroad, for half an hour till we lost the way, and wandered about the foothills, like Virgil’s erippled snake, till 6.40 p.m., just across the watershed of W. Turaa and W. Meseiz. Our guides were at fault in bringing us (to be near some tents) too far north from our first entry into the Turaa plain. The (juickest and best road is straight across to Ain Turaa, and up the east branch of the wadi direct to the watershed. Wednesday, March 28. Hode at 5.5 a.m. past north end of J. Tareif and down W. Meseiz, which is a steep, loose ramp of shingle and stones, scored deeply by water, unfit for wheeled traffic, into the great plain of el-Jurf, across which W. Meseiz cuts its way east to join W. Gussed, flowing north from J. Agrad. At 6.15 a.m. we were well into el-Jurf, and going due east, with J. Antar, a castellated rock with a split head perched on a cone, most conspicuous about ten miles off to the south. J. Jeddah, a group of needles, lay about six miles off down W. Gussed beyond Aba el-Hellu. We rode 90° till 7 a.m. and then 140° till 7.40 a.m., and camped under a tree in Wadi Gussed. It is very fertile in a wild wa y—indeed all the Jurf is. We were camped nearly at the south end of a tongue of hills, which walls off el-Jurf from the Hamdh valley. To the south el-Jurf opens into el-Magrah, up which the railway climbs to a watershed near J. Bueir, and one comes down to join the Hamdh at Abu el-Xaam ; and our own Wadi Guad, rising a little further west, in the foothills of Azrad (where is water in themail), runs down north to join the Hamdh near Jedahah, after giving the water-hole of Abu el-Hella on its passage through the hills. J. Tareif, prolonged by Azrad, forms a blank wall of hill to Bowat. There is no way up it foi camels into the valleys beyond, except a difficult pass just south of our camp. In the afternoon we went up the Dhula of Abu el-Naam, just behind the camp, and examined the railway and the station at 6,000 yards. It has two large basalt and cement two-storeyed buildings, a circular water-tower, and a small house to the west; and about the houses were many bell tents and shelter tents The perimeter was heavily entrenched, but there were no o-uns’visible, and we only saw about 300 men. A trolley went off north with only one man on it, to the bridge over W. Hamdh, which Dakhilallah had attacked. It was a large bridge, of about twenty arches of white stone, and next to it were some shelters, and on the top of a coal-black mound just north of the bridge, some dozen white tents, with Turkish officers lounging m chairs beside them At 2 p.m. a train (locomotive reversed), came m from the south. It had four water cisterns (improvised iron tanks on trucks), and four box-wagons, and after watering, went off north. The station of Istabl Antar was cleariy viS!!)^ on the Ras el-Magrah, but Jedahah was behind hills.

Thursday, March 29. Un at 5 20 am. Very cold, with a restless dawn wind blowing down el-Jurf, singing in the great trees round our camp. We spent most o£ the day admiring Abu el -Naan, from the h 11-top. The garrison paraded, and we counted them as 390 infantry, and twenty-five goats. No camels or horses, except the two or three near the well, which we captured subsequently. A tram came in from the north, and one from the south. 1 hat from the south went on and contained baggage and women. I he northern train stayed all day and the night in the station. At midday we heard from Sherif Shakir, who was coming up with the main body (we were only the^reconnaissance), that he would arrive at sunset, and we wandered out across el-Jurf to the last foothills of Dhula Abu el-Naam, till we found what seemed to be a good gun-position, about 2,000 yards west of the station. There were no Turkish outposts to be found, except that on the bridge. Behind the station is a steep hill, J. Unseih, about 400 yards distant, and we decided to put 400 men into it, to tnkp the Turks in the rear. The hills about us were typical of the Eastern Hejaz hills. They were of glistening, sunburnt stone, very metallic in ring when struck, and splitting red or green or brown as the case may be. The upper part of the hill is a cap, of an outcrop of base rock, and the lower screes are hard at the foot, where they are packed with a thin soil, but loose and sliding on the slopes. From them sprout occasional thorn bushes, and frequent grasses. The commonest grass sends up a dozen blades from one root, and grows hand- to knee-high, of yellow-green colours. At the head are empty ears, between many feathered arrows of silvery down. With these and a shorter grass, ankle deep, bearing a bottle-brush head of pearl-grey, the hillsides are furred white, and dance gaily in the wind. One cannot call it verdure, but it is excellent pasture, and in the valleys are great tufts of coarse grass, waist high, bright green in colour till it fades to a burnt yellow, and growing thickly in all water-lined sand or shingle. Between these tufts are thorn trees from eight to forty feet in height, and less frequently sidr trees, giving thick shade, and dry sugary fruit. Add some brown tamarisk, broom, a great variety of coarse grass and flowers, and everything that has thorns, and you exhaust the usual vegetation of the Hejaz. Only on steep hillsides is there a little plant, hemeid, with fleshy green heart-shaped leaves and a spike of white or red blossom. Its leaves are pleasantly acid, and allay thirst.Shakir arrived at 5 p.m., but brought only 300 men, two machine guns, one mountain gun, and one mountain howitzer. The lack of infantry made the scheme of taking the station in rear impossible, since it would have left the guns without support; so we changed ideas, and decided on an artillery action only. We sent a dynamite party to the north of the station, to cut rails and telegraph at dawn. I started at 8 p.m. with a company of Ateibah and a machine-gun, to lay a mine and cut the wire between Abu el-Naam and Istabl Antar. Mohammed el-Gadhi guided us very well, and we reached the line at 11.15 p.m., in a place where there was cover for the machine- o-uri in a group of bushes and a sandy valley bed about four feet deep, 500 yards west of the rails. I laid a mine, and cut the wire, and at 1 a.m. started back for the main body with a few Ageyl, but did not get in till 5 a.m., through various accidents, and was not able to go forward to the artillery position till 6.30 a.m. 1 found the guns just ready, and we shelled the station till 10 a.m., when Shakir found that the Ateibah infantry had no water, and we retired to W. Gussed without molestation. fHr bis are mostly unobtainable in the eastern Hejaz, which makes it difficult for an Arab force of more than a dozen men to remain in action for half a day. The results of the bombardment were to throw the upper storeys of the large stone buildings into the ground-floors, which were reported to contain stores and water-cisterns. We could not demolish the ground-floors. The water-tank (metal) was pierced and knocked out of shape, and three shells exploded m the pumping room and brought down much of the wall. We (lemolished the well-house, over the well, burned the tents and the wood-pile and obtained a hit on the first waggon of the tram in the station. This set it on fire, and the flames spread to the remaining six waggons, which must have contained inflammable stores, since they burned furiously. The locomotive was behind the northern building, and got steam up, and went o (reverse ) towards Medina. When it passed over the mine it exploded it, under the front bogies (i.e. too late). It was, however, derailed, and 1 hoped to see the machine-gun come into action against it, but it turned out that the gunners had left their position to join us in our attack on the station, and so the seven ™ en were able to “jack” it on the line again m about half an hou (only the front wheels were derailed) and it went off towards Istabl Antar, at foot-pace, clanking horribly. , . The north end of the station now surrendered and abou 200 of the garrison of the north end rushed in driblets for hills (J. Unseih) and took cover there. I examined the prisoners (twenty-four in number, Syrians, of 130th Regt.), and also ic Sf/an J “he train.’ 'The box-body had been lined with matchboard, at an interval o£ about four inches and packed nea the floor with cement (loopholed) and above with «h m g le - was burning hotly, and the Turks were oo obtain accurate details.— 212 — We fired altogether fifty rounds (shrapnel) from 2,200 and 900 yards and f(I sa w nine only) and forty- Deserters ZtoSeledW — of All Nasir (the F^yptiai'i 1 * Bah-Arab ” m Medina) and a couple of camels from the wflhhouse, and destroyed many rails. Our casualties were one nan wounded Had there been enough Arab infantry to occupy T Unseih which commanded the trenches at 400 yards (plunmng te) I think we could have taken the entire garrison. The Ateibah were not asked to do very much, and I do not think would have done it if asked. The Juhemah and the gunners behaved very well, and I think that the attack—as an experiment justified itself. It had the effect, in the nfort three days, of persuading the Turks to evacuate every outpost and blockhouse on the line, and concentrate the garrison in the various railway Friday, March 30. We marched back to el-Jurf, and camped in the middle of it from 12.30 p.m. till 3 p.m. We then rode np the Wadi Meseiz (Gradually turning’ west and south) till the wateished at 5.15 p.m., and at 5.30 p.m. had crossed the divide into W. Turaa, and rode down it till 6.30 p.m., when we camped at Ain Turaa, just where the eastern Wadi luraa enters the great plain of Bir Fueis. I he march (like all Shakirs marches) was very fast. The water of the W. Ain is very good, and fairly plentiful. Saturday, March 31. Left el-Ain at 5.45 a.m.; rode across the plain, up the side of the wadi and over an easy pass (to the right) into Seil el-Howeita. From this we took the easy southern road into el-Muaggad, and stopped from 8.30 a.m. till 3.45 p.m. in WAdi Serum. We then marched to Bir el-Amri at 5.45 p.m. and camped there. Sunday, April 1. Bode from Bir el-Amri to camp at Abu Markha from 6 a.m. till 8.30 a.m. Abu Markha to Abu el-Naam : 14 hours, 20 minutes. Abu el-Naam to Abu Markha : 13 hours, 15 minutes. 1L —Abu Markha to Madahrij. After returning from Abu el-Naam with Sherif Shakir, 1 stopped a short while with Sidi Abdullah, and on Monday, April 2, marched at 2.20 a.m. for the railway to the north of Hadiyah. I took with me Dakhilallah el-Gadhi with 40 Juheinah, and had as well Sultan el-Abbud (Ateibah), Sherif Abdullah, and Sherif Agab (two sons of Hamza el-Feir), and Mohammed el- Ladhi. A machine gun with six men and seven infantrymen(Syrians) came along also, as my hope was to derail a train with a Garland mine, and then attack it from a previously prepared machine-gun position. Sherif Shakir rode the first half-hour with us. We marched down Wadi Ais by the same road as that to Abu ei-N'aam to the village site at 6.20 p.m. Instead of leaving Wadi Ais at this point, we turned north with the valley, and camped at 7 p.m. opposite Magreh el-Semn, under hills on the left bank of the Wadi. Tuesday, April 3. Marched at 5.20 a.m. up the wadi at 50° till 5.35 a.m., and then swung round towards 20 in a curve till 6 a.m., aiming direct at J. Shemail, a great mass, which deflects the valley westward. At 5.40 a.m. we were opposite the mouth of W. Serum, and at 5.55 a.m. passed Bir Bedair on our left. At 6 a.m. we were opposite the point of J. Shemail, and the wadi, which had been clear and broad and shingly, narrowed down. At 6.30 a.m. Wadi Gharid came in on the left (it is the quickest way to Abu Markka, but steep), and at 6.40 a.m. we were opposite Bir Bedia, in the mouth of Sell Bedia on the left ol our road. Seil Bedia rises near Seil Osman. The wadi now widened out and became full of large trees, and more green than any wadi 1 had seen in the Hejaz. It has come down in flood twice this year, and affords splendid pasturage. We were now going about 40° and at 7.15 a.m. reached Du el-Murabba, in a broad part of Wadi Ais, where it became a small and very beautiful plain. We then turned 60 and marched down the wadi till 7.45 a.m., when we halted opposite the mouth ot Seil el-Howeiti (from J. Serd). At 1.15 p.m. we marched again, and at 1.45 p.m. reached Ribiaan, the last well in Wadi Ais. 1 he well is lined with a rough stone steynmg, and is about ten teet in diameter and fifteen feet deep ; water very shgit y iacns i. Wadi Ais at this point leaves the hills, and enters a great open plain, studded with low mounds. This plain is the common bed G united beds) of, amongst others, Wad, Ais, Wad, Hamdh W. Tubja, W.

We left the direct road a little when we “O™ 4 ® ^ 2.10 p.m. and marched a little way north-east A/'h aGrallel left Wadi Ais and crossed a low bank into el-bershah, p— 214 wadi in which were many tents of Harb and Anazeh, come by permission into the Juheinah diva for pasture. We camped near them (they refused us hospitality) at 3.20 p.m. Wednesday, Aprd 4. Rode at 5.30 a.m. and at 6.15 a.m. crossed the level bed of Wadi Turaa, and Wadi Hamdh at 6.45 a.m. The Hamdh was as full of aslani wood as at Abu Zereibat and had the same hummocky bed, with sandy blisters over it—but it was only about 200 yards wide, and shallow. We halted at 8 a.m. in W. Tubja, which was a sort of wilderness garden, with a profusion of grass and shrubs in which the camels rejoiced. The weather was very hot, with a burning sun that made the sandy ground impossible for me to walk on barefoot. The Arabs have soles like asbestos, and made little complaint, except of the warmth of the air. There had been thunder all yesterday, and half a dozen showers of rain last night and to-day. J. Serd and J. Kasim were wrapped in shafts and sheets of a dark blue and yellow vapour that seemed motionless and solid. We marched across W. Tubja again at 1.20 p.m. About 1.40 p.m. we noticed that part of the yellow cloud from J. Serd was approaching us, against the wind, raising scores of dust-devils before its feet. It also produced two dust- spouts, tight and symmetrical—stationary columns, like chimneys— one to the right and one to the left of its advance. When it got nearer, the wind, which had been scorching us from the north-east, changed suddenly, and became bitterly cold and damp, from the south-west. It increased greatly in violence, and at the same time the sunlight disappeared and the air became thick and ochre-yellow. About three minutes later the advancing brown wall (l think it was about 1,500 feet high) struck.us, and proved to be a blanket of dust, and large grains of sand, twisting and turning most violently with itself, and at the same time advancing east at about forty miles an hour. The internal whirling winds had the most bizarre effect. They tore our cloaks from us, turned our camels sometimes right round, and sometimes drew them together in a vortex, and large bushes, tufts of grass, and small trees were torn up clean by the roots, in a dense cloud of the soil about them, and w’ere driven against us, or dashed over our heads, with sometimes dangerous force. We were never blinded it was always possible to see seven or eight feet each side but it was risky to look out, since one never knew if one would meet a flying tree, or a rush of pebbles, or a column of dust. This habub lasted for eighteen minutes, and then ceased nearly as suddenly as it had come, and while we and our clothes and camels were all smothered in dust and yellow from head to root, down burst torrents of rain, and muddied us to the skin, the wind swung round to the north, and the rain drove before it thiough our cloaks, and chilled us through and through. At o p.m. we had crossed the plain and entered the bare valley ofy\. Dhaiji, which cuts through J. Jindal at its southern end, from the railway to the Hamdh. It is fairly broad at first, sandy, with precipitous rock walls. We rode up it till 4 p.m. and left our camels in a side valley, and climbed a hill to see the line. The hill was of naked rock, and with the wet and the numbing cold the Ateibah servant of Sultan el-Abbud lost his nerve, pitched over a cliff, and smashed his skull to pieces. It was our only casualty on the trip. When we got to the hill-top it was too thick weather to see the railway, so T returned to the camels, and shivered by them for an hour or two. We were stumbled upon by a mounted man, with whom we exchanged ineffectual shots, and were annoyed by this, as surprise was essential, and we could hear the bugles of Madahrij sounding recall and supper in the station, which was also an irritation. However, at 9 p.m. the explosives came up, with the rest of the party, and I started out with Sultan, Dakhilallah and Mohammed el-Gadhi for the line. We had some delay in finding a machine-gun position, for the railway runs everywhere near the eastern hills of the valley, and the valley is about 3,000 yards broad. However, eventually, we found a place opposite kilometre 1121, and I laid a mine (trigger central, with rail-cutting charges 15 yards north and south of it respectively) with some difficulty owing to the rain, at 12 p.m. It took till 1.45 a.m. to cover up the traces of the digging, and we left the whole bank, and the sandy plain each side, as covered with huge footmarks as though a school of elephants had danced on it, and made tracks that a blind man could have felt. 1 wiped out most of those on the embankment itself, however, by walking up and down in shoes over it. Such prints are indistinguishable from the daily footmarks of the patrol inspecting the line. We got back to the new position at 2.30 a.m. (still raining and blowing and very cold) and sat about on stones till dawn, when the camels and machine-gun came up. Dakhilallah, who had been guide and leader all night, now sent out patiols and sentries and outposts in all directions, and went on a hilltop himself with glasses to watch the line. The sun fortunately came out, so we were able to get dry and warm, and by midday were again gasping in the heat. A cotton shirt is a handy garment, but not adaptable to such sudden changes o temperature. Thursday, April 5. At 6 a m a trolley with four men and a sergeant as a passenger came from Hadiyah ('Haraimil) to Madahrij, passing over the mine without stopping. A working party of sixty men came out .of Madahrij, and began to replace five te ' e SfP h P 0,e , 8 f b 7 lo 'I'' &lt; 1° W ' near the station the day before by the habub.

This was too much for the nerves of Madahnj, which called m its working party, and opened a brisk rifle fire on us, at about 5,000 yards. Ldiyah (or rather its outpost on a hdltop) was encouraged by this to take a share. As they were about J ,200 yards off, they retained their fire, but played selections on the bugle from 8.30 a.m. till 4 p.m. This disclosure of ourselves position. The Juheinah and put us in rather an unfortunate myself were on camels, and posniuu. tiic , :i i ' • therefore pretty safe, but the machine gun was a sledge-maxim (German) and very heavy. It was on a mule, and the mules could only walk. Our position was between Madahrij (200 men) and Hadiyah (1,100 men), with Hadiyah in Wadi Tubja, behind our backs. I was afraid of their trying to cut us off in the rear, and after consulting Dakhilallah we rode past Madahrij to the head of W. Um Reikham, which runs into Tubja just north of el. Jindal, and sent the mules with an escort of fifteen Juheinah back to Wadi Ais. Had the Turks attacked us, the few Juheinah with me would not have been enough to cover the retreat of the gun : sind the xmiiners were Meccan tailors, inexpert in handling it. Dakhilallah, Sultan Mohammed and myself then rode back to the head of Wadi Dhaije, and camped at 9.40 a.m. under some good shady trees, from which we could see the line. This appeared to annoy the Turks, who shot and trumpeted at us incessantly, till about 4.30 p.m. No trains passed during this time—I fancy our presence held up the traffic, for a lone engine came down from the north to Madahrij, and there whs also heavy smoke from Hadiyah station. At 4.30 p.m. the Turkish noise stopped, and we got on our camels at 5 p.m. and rode out slowly across the plain towards the line. Madahrij revived in a paroxysm of rifle fire (4,000 yards, no damage) and all the trumpets of Hadiyah began again. Dakhilallah was most pleased. We went straight to kilometre 1121, and made the camels kneel beside the line, while Dakhilallah (whose strong piety has a vein of humour) called the idhan, and led the sunset prayer between the rails. As soon as it got dark the Turks became quiet, and T dug up the mine (a mostunpleasant proceeding : laying a Garland mine is shaky work, but scrabbling along a line for 100 yards in the ballast looking for a trigger that is connected with two powerful charges must be a quite uninsurable occupation), and I found it had sunk a sixteenth of an inch, probably owing to the damp ground. We replaced it, and then fired a number of charges along the rails between us and Madahrij with great effect. We also cut up a good deal of telegraph wire and a number of poles, and at 7.30 p.m. rode off down W. Dhaije again. At 9 p.m. we reached the Tubja—Hamdh plain, and galloped across it furiously, passing Wadi Hamdh, W. Turaa, W. Abu Marra, and reaching El- Fershah and the machine-gun camp at 12.15 a.m. Friday, April 6. Started at 6 a.m., reached Rubiaan at 7 a.m., and left it at 7.15 a.m. Wadi Ais had been down in flood since avc left, and the surface was all shining with white slime and pools of soft grey water. The camels slipped over this most amusingly, and most of the party went down. Dakhilallah therefore drew us up a mouth of Seii Howeiti, and across its delta, and over a little pass into the eastern bay of the plain of Murebba in Wadi Ais. We crossed this, passed Seil Badia, and halted at 9.15 a.m. in the mouth of W. Gharid. We mounted again at 2.45 p.m. and rode slowly (everything was stiff and tired) to the bend of Wadi Ais by the ruins a,t 4.45 p.m., where we camped for the night. Our two messengers who had been left in Dhaije came in late, and reported that the mine (which we had heard explode very vigorously at 7.30 a.m. this morning) had gone off north and south of a locomotive with rails and about^ 300 soldiers, arriving from Hadiyah to repair our damage. The quantity of Turks frightened our men away, so 1 cannot saj^ if any inconvenience was caused the train ; but the break in the line was not repaired for five days, which looks as though something had delayed the enemy. Saturday, April 7. We started at 1 a.m. and slept the rest of the night in Marraha from 2.30 a.m. till 6 a.m. Then rode and reached Abu Markha at 8 a.m. The results of this trip were to, show me the rare value of Dakhilallah and his son. Their humour makes railway-breaking a pleasure to them; their authority keeps the Juheinah m better order than ever I have seen ; and old Dakhilallah has grown gie} in successful ghazzus, and is as careful and astute as any raidei could be. It also showed that Garland mines, properly laid, aie impossible for the Turks to detect. Eleven men searched for my mine for twenty minutes. Also that the Turkish garrisons suffer badly from nerves; and that a machine-gun par t} t&lt;&gt; deal with stranded locomotives may require great mobility m retreat or advance, and should be, ii possible, mounted on the same kind of animal as the tribal escort. l.E.D.— 218 — Aden Protectorate. The Treaty Tribe*. 411 the subsidized chiefs are keenly interested in the Great War and especially in the ultimate issue of the inroad ot Turks 1 V - ,nrl vioiniLv None of them loves the Turk or his method* 5 of Administration, and all wonder at our inactivity. Immediately after the fall of Lahej on July 4, 191o, Idnsi wrote “his Aden agent that this mishap was due, not to the weakness hut to the slackness of the British. A certain number of tribes men have gone over to Lahej. Of this number some were com pelled by forcemqjeure; others were incited by greed of booty, and some were impelled by fear. 1.— Haushabi. There is no doubt that, foreseeing the Turkish inroad from Mavvia through his country, Sultan Ali Mani, who is weakness personified, made overtures to Ah Said Pasha, just before the Turks started to move. So far force majeure. But Ah Mam went farther and was in Lahej firing and looting the town till the Turks stopped him. After the evacuation by Sultan Sir Ah bin Ahmed, Ali was styled Sultan of Lahej, but he has never been in favour there. He stays mainly in his own capital of el-Museum and writes petulant letters to the Pasha, recapitulating his good services and whining for an increased stipend. His action m Lahej was due to his long-cherished hatred for the house of Abdali. The latter had led an expedition into Haushabi territory years before, at the instance of the Aden Residency ; for the then ruler was coquetting with the I urks. This expedition led to the loss of certain Haushabi lands. The district north of el-Anad, known as el-Hurrakat and comprising Nobat Dukaim and J. Munif, formed the subject- matter for a boundary case before me in 1905. I adjudicated in favour of the Abdali Sultan’s right to these places. The Haushabi now believes he will extend his borders at the Abdali’s expense. 2.— Amiri. Some time before the war the Emir Nasr of Dala had come to an understanding with the Turkish kaimmakam of Kataba. and for many years there has been a correspondence between the Emir Shaif (father of Nasr) and the Imam of Sana. Emir Shaif was a crafty old fox. He hated the Turkish invasion and longed for deliverance at our hands. When freed, however, he began to practise petty villainies on his tribesmen under pretext of con solidating his territories so long in the occupation of the Turks, and he resented our interfering with schemes that involved his certain ruin. So he prayed for our departure. Emir Shaif died in Delhi in 1911. His death was ascribed to poison administeredby me! Emir Nasr is pro-Turk, pro-imam and .anti-British. Lhe hmirs have sprung from a race of Muvvallads or half-breeds. n n0 /f° d i Cai \h ex P ected o£ tliem - The village.of the reigninj house (besides Dala) is Kharafa, and a jingling saw sings ’ c Trust not the house of Kharafa, even if it swear an oath.” H.— Abdali. hen the late Sir Ali bin Ahmed came into Aden as a refugee on duly 5, 1915, there accompanied him some 1000 of h^ people. The rest stayed behind in their villages; but some still trickle into Imad, near Sheikh Othman. The vast majority of Abdalis, who stayed behind, did so to safeguard their houses and property, while others remained to carry on their business of camel-breeding. These men have been forced, on occasion, to take up arms against us, but they do not fight seriously. There are also some Abdali tribesmen who have willingly joined the Turks in the belief that the latter will stay and take over the protection of Lahej in the end, ousting us. 4 .—Subehi (pi. Sabbeha). These petty marauders are the gipsy canaille of south-west Arabia. All have joined the Turks for booty’s sake, and then gone back to their villages. When Ali Said Pasha tried to levy taxes there, the Subehis rebelled, and several small punitive columns have been sent against them from Lahej. 8.— Fadli. The old Sultan, Husein bin Ahmed, joined the Turks, or rather went to Lahej, through fear that his country would be overrun, as was Lahej. He loathes the Turks, but owing to our lack of activity, he has no faith in our ability to protect him if he were to reject the Turkish proposals af Ali Said. He once asked us to land troops at Shukra. We refused, I think wrongly. Just a demonstration was asked for to impress the Fadli tribesmen. Our refusal to comply was translated as our impotence to act. Sultan Husein is an old man of over 70 years, and has cataract in both eyes. If he dies, his grandson, Abdul Kadir, would be likely to succeed. But knowing the latter’s pro-British proclivities, the Pasha has offered to name a substitute when the time comes. He has often invited the old Sultan to take up residence in Lahej, where he has been given some of the lands of the Abdali Sultan. Sultan Husein distrusts the Turks and prefers to live in Shukra or to till his rich crop-land in Abyan. fi.— Yafa and Aulaki. Sections from certain Mausata (Upper Yafa) tribes ; some Lower Aulaki clans, e.g., Ba Kazim (these befriended the Germans who landed from the schooner) ; some from Upper xVulaki sections ; some of the Badfan clansmen, and some Alawis— have gone to Lahej to see what they can pick up. but not at all drawn by any love of the Turks.220 — '■— Behan, H'da- Aulaki Sultan’s domain Upper and Lower La‘ , sh(jik f | __ in fact all territories where tnd that of the Upper Auto , tQ ug AU expect us to assert Turks have not a re being driven back, they mil ^P’th® on the line^re^ ^ Ais as a war The Arab proteges ^ ^ hlcll they have no direct between two L&gt;auia.. &lt; 0 .] H( i t0 see the crumpling up ot concern.

Colonel Pearson lias returned recently from the ceremony of the investiture of Has Taffari with the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. The investiture seems to have been an impressive affair and to have resulted in so great an increase in the prestige of Ras Taffari that an old Fitaurari, who had hitherto refused to render to Taffari the homage which he had willingly afforded to Menelik, knelt before him and kissed his knee, expressing his recognition of the value of the decoration as a proof of friendship on the part of Great Britain towards Abyssinia and towards the Ras personally. The Government is now entirely occupied with measures for dealing with Lij Yasu, who is believed to have a following of 2,000 men, with ample stores of grain at Magdala, whose resources are such as to enable him to maintain his followers there indefinitely. It is now intended to despatch against Magdala a force of the nominal strength of 50,000 men, which, however, is unlikely, in fact, to work out at more than 30,000. A portion of this force, under Ras Abata and Ras Kassa, had already left Adis Ababa during Colonel Pearson s stay, and a further contingent under Fit. Hapta Giorgis, who is regarded as the only man capable of holding such a force together and of overthrowing Lij Yasu, was expected to leave on April 2o. Ras Taffari, Ras Hailu and Bituaded Haili Giorgis were to follow a few days later. It was calculated that the force would reach Magdala about May 10, and it was intended to attack simultaneously the five roads leading to the summit. Owing to food difficulties, it is not possible to maintain a force longer than eight days before Magdala ; and if by then the place has not fallen, it is the intention to withdraw again, leaving posts on all the five roads to watch it and control Lij Yasu’s movements. An escape on his part to the plains is, perhaps, not wholly to be deprecated, as there should be no great difficulty in rounding him up there. Elsewhere, the situation looks more promising. The revolt in Simyen has collapsed, and Ganiazmach Ababi, who was deputed by Lij Yasu to stir up trouble there, has surrendered to Negus Waldo Giorgis. ' Ras Seyyum, of Tigre, who has been an uncertain factor, having found that his chiefs were not disposed to support him in a refusal to obey the Central Government, is on his way to meet Ras Taffari. The people of Wollo are reported weary of fightino’ and will probably make no opposition to Government troops. The province itself, with the districts of W orra, Haimanot and Gishe, has been given to Ras Abata. Abata, an impetuous and fearless soldier, is a bitter enemy of Lij Yasu, who kept him for five years in chains in Magdala, and Taffari has piobab v acted wisely in making friends with him and in restoring linn to a position of trust, as his name and influence may be inyaluab e later on in any reorganisation of the Government involving the breaking of the power of the Council of Ministers.Deiaz Balcha is reported to have been asked to take charge of Adis Ababa, as Ras Taftari has ordered the majority of the Council to accompany the army, less, probably, w.th the idea of utilising the troops of which they dispose, than of safeguarding himself against intrigue during Ins absence from the capital. LIBYA. The Agreements with Mohammed Idris. The policy adopted by the British and Italian Governments of supporting Seyyid Mohammed Idris in his efforts to make o-ood his hereditary claim to the headship of the Senussi sect has resulted in the conclusion of agreements between him and the two Governments. These agreements provide, on the Senussi’s part, for the preservation of peace, the surrender of all persons who' may be compelled to land on the coast of Cyreuaica at places not in effective occupation of the Italians ; the surrender or expul sion from Africa of all enemy officers or agents; and the removal of all persons who may try to make trouble between Seyyid Idris and either of the two Governments. In return, Great Britain and Italy have consented to allow a certain amount of trade with the Arabs at the ports of Solium, Tobruk, Derna, and Bengazi. daghbub remains within Egyptian territory, but its administration will be entrusted to Seyyid Idris, so that it practically remains in the same position as before the war. The amount of trade, especially in foodstuffs, that can be permitted at Solium, and also the freedom of entry of Western Arabs into Egypt are, of course, much restricted by the conditions produced by the war. It is, of course, undesirable that the Arabs should be allowed to accumulate reserve-stocks of food ; but it is probable that some time must elapse before the Italians will be in a position to supply them with even the amount of food that might safely be permitted to enter the country. The inevitable delay will not, however, cause as much suffering as might have been expected, since the barley crop has just been harvested and is believed to have been up to the average in most parts of the country. The stability of these agreements depends on whether Seyyid Idris is able to establish his authority over the Senussia, or not. It is believed that he is sincerely desirous of maintaining good relations with the British Government and with Egypt, and of putting an end to the war with Italy, which has lasted so long. It is probable that, in order to avoid hostilities with the Italians and the renewal of the blockade, he will make any concession which does not compromise his authority over the Arabs. At the same time, it must be remembered that, though Seyyid Ahmed is not likely to oppose Seyyid Idris openly, it isfar from probable that he will resign leadership willingly, or that he will wholeheartedly acquiesce in a pacific policy. If he gets the chance of persuading the Arabs that Idris has mismanaged affairs and has made too great concessions to England or to Italy, he will almost certainly use it as a weapon for the purpose of ousting Seyyid Idris and regaining his former power. At this moment Seyyid Idris’s chances of success appear to be very good. He left the vicinity of Tobruk about April 18 with the intention of marching ria Jedabia to Jalu to meet Seyyid Ahmed, who was last reported to be in that neighbourhood. His first move will no doubt be to detach from Seyyid Ahmed those of his followers who still adhere to him. When he has reduced his cousin to impotence, he may succeed in prevailing on him to retire to Kufra, where he can do little harm. It appears as if Idris has definitely broken with the Turkish Government and its emissaries in Northern Africa ; but it is probable that he will accept from them any arms or money that they may send him in the hope of gaining him to their side. He cannot be expected to hand over the Turkish officers as prisoners of war, but he has undertaken to expel them from Africa if they fall into Ids hands. Seyyid Ahmed, on the other hand, is very much under Turkish influence, and there is a possibility of his joining Nuri, Suleiman Bar uni, and Ramadan Shitewi, who are believed to be threatening Sirt and endeavouring to stir up the Arabs in Cyrenaiea against the Italians. As soon as the Great War is over, it is possible that the Italian Government will press Idris to carry into effect some of the conditions of the agreements, the execution of which has been deferred till circumstances are favourable. The extent to which he will be able to meet their views will probably depend on the security of his position amongst the Arabs. He could at any moment make himself supreme amongst them by adopting a fanatical policy and proclaiming a holy war against Italy ; but, before he can make concessions for the purpose ol maintaining peace and trade, he must be quite certain that he has a sufficient grip of the Arabs to ensure their acquiescence. The successful termination of the peace negotiations with Mohammed Idris is generally known by the western Bedouins, and the effect on them will probably be good. I hey have suffered considerably by the feeling ol unrest and the possibility of further hostilities, and can now settle down to their formei avocations. While, in the past, no great love was lost between the Aidad Ali and the Arabs lying further west, there was always a considerable movement along the coastal zone and on the inland trade routes. This has only been carried on during the last nineteen months, at the risk of spoliation by the lurco- Senussi force, or of arrest by' the British. On the whole, the Egyptian Bedouin has less to gain by the re-establishment of peace than his western neighbour, as he ias not been so reduced by T starvation ; but a great part of the224 — In.-lev crop of the coastal area used to find its way westwards, as well as the Siwa date crop, and with settled conditions the Bedouins have hope that trade may he resumed. It is as yet c «dv to judge what the position ot Mohammed Idris will be with our Bedouins. Amongst the more enhghtened he is regarded as a man of stronger character and wider out ook than his cousin Ahmed for he saw far enough ahead to realize the futility, from a Senussi point of view, of an attack on Egypt, and thus has avoided the odium which Seyyid Ahmed incurred by his failure. On the other hand, Senussism has ceased to exist m Hjgypt as anything but a religious confraternity; the zawms have been demolished, and the mosques closed These will only be re-opened when the time conies, under orthodox preachers, so that in the eves of the militant Senussist of two years ago, Mohammed Idris will be the head of a confraternity of much diminished importance in Egypt, whatever the position may be beyond our western frontier. Memories are not longer in the East than in the West, and one may expect in the not distant future to hear Seyvid Ahmed extolled as a great man who was sold bv his treacherous allies ; while Mohammed Idris will be decried as a friend of the Christian, whose accession to power synchronized with the collapse of Senussism in Egypt. NOTES. Euphrates Tribes. Baghdad reports that the hostile tribesmen, who have been annoying us on the left bank from Felhijah southwards to Museiyib (just north of Kerbela), have now been brought to book by punitive measures. Their country has been patrolled by con verging columns starting from the two extreme points, and severe punishments have been indicted. The leading sheikhs are now coming in, and terms will be imposed upon them. The Duleim, who, as Baghdad remarks (under date May 7), must remain under Turkish induence so long as the enemy H.Q. are at Rainadieh, are still hostile; but the Amarat, of Fahad liadhdhal’s following, show a disposition to break with Ajeimi Saadun and come in with us. Fahad is still some distance from Kerbela. We are trying to get the Nejef people to hold up or refuse access to Ibn Rashid’s food caravans, which usually come to the Euphratean markets at this season ; but our hold is not yet strong enough between Nejef and Samawah to ensure success. One of these caravans, of 5,000 camels, was reported at Ain es- Seyyid, five hours from Nejef, when Baghdad sent us this infor mation. Kuweit News. Our Political Agent at Kuweit sends the following, undei date February 19.11 Sheikh Salim is very busy introducing reforms. One of his first acts Avas to send for the Jews and forbid them henceforth to distil liquor in Kuweit. The amount of drinking that had been going on in the place was becoming a scandal. I had occasion to speak of it^several times to the late Sheikh and once publicly in his Mejlis in the market-place. Nothing was done, hoAvever, till Salim took the matter up. He is inclined to puritanism, and strong liquor is anathema to him. The Sheikh is also dividing the city into Mahallas or quarters, each under a Mukhtar or guardian, who will be responsible for maintaining order in his quarter and for bringing all delinquencies to notice. Particularly, he will be expected to keep an eye on all strangers and report their goings-on, if suspicious. Export-dues, fish and house taxes have been abolished, and all imports are uoav to pay a uniform ad valorem duty of 4 per cent. These and other reforms have been separately reported. They are viewed Avith favour by the people generally ; but, no doubt, those whose bad habits or private interests are affected, Avill seek means of subverting the new regime sooner or later. Detraction of the Sheikh will probably be their chief weapon. The Customs-Master and Mullah Salih, who are said to have feathered their nests rather too luxuriously, are being carefully watched, and one Abdul Aziz bin Salim has been appointed Mufatish, or superintendent over them. The Sheikh appears to be genuinely anxious to put a stop to the illicit trade Avith Hail and Medina; but in this he Avill have enormous difficulties to contend with.. The other day he sent for the principal merchants, showed them a letter from me on the subject, and threatened them with dire penalties if they continued their blockade-running ventures. He warned them he would not punish them in the mild frankish way (i.e. by fine and imprison ment), but Avould cut off the tongue of any offender he caught. It is to be hoped that this threat will hav^e an effect; but the enormous profits of the traffic have so far proved too great a temptation for even the best among them.” Hejaz Mission to Abyssinia. Sayyid Abbas Melki, who had been sent by the King of the Hejaz to promote his cause among the Abyssinian and Somali Moslems, and counteract the formerly active Turkish propaganda, has now returned home after a most successful journey. As has already been said, he started off badly, scandalizing local opinion by inveighing against the Ottoman Sultan’s person. This having been put right, all went Avell. He travelled from Adis Abeba Avith the British Somaliland Commissioner through Harar and Hargeisa to Berbera, and had a gratifying reception, especially in the last two places, where he was feted by all the Moslem community. His journey, therefore, cannot have failed to have good results.22 f&gt; Svrmn Railways. . ' T, rmorl *sourc6 W6 have received recent information from ^ goo y oIl g yr i an railways.

Under date April 26, Captain Lawrence sends the following notes on miscellaneous topics. They were collected by him during his sojourn with Abdullah in Wadi Ais Antecedents of the Uejaz Revolt. Talaat, in 1913, showed great anxiety about the situation in the Heiaz. Its subjugation and the imposition of militan service there had been a favourite project. Mahmud Shevket and the Turkish Ministry generally looked upon the situation as disquieting, on account of the great hold Husem PasTa ^ was o-etting on the people. This was the real reason ol Walnbs appointment, and his withdrawal was a personal triumph lor Feisal, who secured from Talaat a promise that Wahib would be lied by court-martial for infringing the privileges of the Hejaz. Sherif Abdullah was regarded as the probable cause of trouble in the Hejaz, and to keep him out of it he was offemd first the Wakf Ministry and then the Vilayet of Yemen. He saw the idea, and refused the appointments. Abdullah has a low opinion of Talaat’s judgment, and regards him as brutal and ignorant. The previous plan of Sherif Abdullah to secure the independence of Hejaz (as a preliminary to the formation o an Arab State) was to lay sudden hands on the pilgrims at Mecca during the great feast. He calculated that the foreign Governments concerned (England, France, Italy, and Holland) would bring pressure on the Porte to secure their release. ” |‘ el ‘ the Porte’s efforts had failed, these Governments would have ha to approach the Sherif direct, and would have found him anxiou&gt;to do all in his power to meet their wishes, in exchange for a promise of immunity from Turkey in the future. This action had been fixed (provisionally) for 1915, but was quashed by the war. 1 • Hejaz Tribes. Abdullah gave the eastern Ateibah (he has little control over them, and they would probably not have come to Hejaz to nght for him, had he asked them) orders to help Ibn baud against Ibn Rashid. It was partly on account of this that bn Rashid declared war on the Sherif. Abdullah doesn’t really care at all if they help Ibn Saud or not; but the order was an assumption of control over all the Ateibah (which Abdullah pretends to) in a form to which Ibn Saud could hardly object with grace. The Turks gave decorations (mentioned in “Arab Bulletin,” No. 44) to Aida, Towala, and Fagir (Fuqara) Sheikhs. The recipients decided to show their new orders to Sidi Abdullah, but, as they were crossing the line near Toweira, they ran into a Turkish patrol, and the camel carrying their personal baggage was killed and had to be abandoned. The Turks have thus received back their insignia. _ The Ateibah believe that Christians wear hats so that the projecting brims may intervene between their eyes and the uncongenial sight of God. Dakhilallah el-Gadhi, who has had good means of judging, regards the Billi as less than half the strength of the Juheinah, and a little less than the tribes under Ferhan el-Aida. Ferhan (who is with Abdullah) is the son of Motlog Allayda, Doughty’s old host. Dakhilallah says that Billi and Huweitat are much fiercer fighters than Wuld Ali or Ateibah. Indeed, I notice a contempt for the Ateibah among the Juheinah, and think that there is a good deal of justification for the feeling.I* 1SECRET. Arab Hureav, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, May 23, 1917. No. 51.

Lhe situation remains much the same, pending the develop ment of more organized and extensive operations against the railway by Sherif Abdullah in the Hadiyah section, and Sherif beisal in the Ala section. Meanwhile desultory raiding as far north as Disad is maintained, and the Turks have had to bring more men into the Moadhdham district. Kow that they have so many troops in South Palestine, they may spare a battalion or two to reinforce the railway guards ; but supply difficulties must limit such reinforcements. Abdullah’s men have had a successful raid at Toweira, and taken nine Turks. Bir el-Mashi is still unshaken. The Turks, so long as the)' hold this point and also Manjur on the Darb es-Sultani, are secured against a surprise attack on Medina from south or west; and, commanding the railway also, can afford to leave Medina itself denuded of troops. It appears that, in addition to the 42nd and 55th Regiments, they still keep the 130th south of Medina. News has come from Feisal that Abdullah has received a deputation of eighteen Abdah Shammar sheikhs, bringing- excuses and a letter from Ibn Ajil. They stated that Ibn Rashid had deceived them with assertions that the British had invaded Hejaz : now that they know the Sherif is supreme and only helped by us, they will not fire another shot at his men. There is no sign of fbn Rashid himself having come down to the Medina neighbourhood, nor of his patrols which, it was reported, were to take over the guard of the southern section ol the railway. He has, no doubt, kept at home to watch Ibn baud in Qasim and Nawwaf Shaalan in Jauf (though he is said, on good authority, to have an agreement with the latter). leisal himself has had letters from Fahad ibn Hadhdhal (^see also p. 246) and Mohammed ibn Mijlad, the two paramount chiefs of the Amarat, who say they only wait for him to come their wa) to join forces (later information from M ejh implies that one of the Mijlad. family, if not Mohammed himself, brought these letters). That he has had a similar letter from Ajeimi Saadun is also reported. Feisal left Wejh for Jeddah on May 17 in the ship convey ing Sir Mark Sykes and Monsieur Picot to meet King Husein on May 19. He proposes to return by the first opportunity, to push his offensive against the railway. The meeting with the King duly took place, and the Commissioners proceeded to Aden.Wejh to Wadi Ais and back. -Wejh to Wadi Ais viA Darb hill o£ the two), ^ - | e( ^ area 0 £ rough stones. This Khauthla road across a jd d ^ a wadi rossed it, and lasted ouly till li.oO a m., wiie ^ ^ ^ ^ w h en we ^dTwiA^’which runs down to Munaibura. The going for the last hour was rough. March 11. Started at 6 a.m. up a tributary of Seil Arja, and continued in it till 6 30 a.m., when we reached the head of the valley and pntered a plain,'about a mile wide At 6.45 a.m. the -- forked a^ we went right downhill,at 140°,into Sell Mismah, at 7.10a.m. Mismah runs into Aria and Munaibura. We crossed it and rode up a side- valley (rough in parts) to a watershed at 7.40 a.m., and a steep descent of a few minutes into a great sand and gravel plain Across this we went at 110° till 8.15 a.m., when we crossed \\ adi el-Murra, which runs into the Sebakha at Kurna ; J. M urra was about three miles away to the north. At 10.10 a.m. we reached W adi Abu Aiai, running from 20° to 200°; it is not one bed, but a whole system of sells, all shallow and bushy, with soft sandy water courses winding about them. About three nnles away on the rio-ht lay J. Ajwi, overlooking Mersa Zuam. Ajwi is a very un- rmstakable square-sided flat-topped coral reef. We stopped at 10 45 a.m. in W'adi Abu Ajaj and started again at l2.4o p.m. At 1.30 p.m. I was abreast of J. Tibgila, about five miles oil, and at 1.50 p.m. and 2.5 p.m. crossed the branches of WVli Ghorban, which passes just south of libgila. Ihe going across the plain was at first soft, and later rather more solid, but with \er\ sort sandy valleys, which would be bad for cars. The guide now took us too far east, and the path entered tin*, lower spurs of J. naal, so that we did not enter the Hamdh valley till 4 p.m. W e bore across this to the ghadir at Abu Zereibat, which we reached at 6 p.m. It was little, if any, smaller than it had been in January last. March 12. Started at 3.45 a.m. and proceeded to lose the road in the dark. At 4.30 a.m. we entered low rough hills, J. Agumma, till 5.20 a.m., when we turned to the right up Seil Aguna at 1^- At 5.30 a.m. reached the watershed, which was easy, and rode down a short valley on luxuriant colocynth into el-Khubt, at 6.10. a.m. Colocvnth makes the best timber when crushed anddried. _ Its juice is rubbed on the feet to produce a purgative effect, which is said to be quite distinct, even when the drug is applied in this very diluted manner. Horses which will eat its stalks and leaves can go without water for a considerable time. El-Khubt is a great plain, draining at its extremity into Wadi Hamdh near Abu Zereibat. A road goes up it to Urn Lejj. We crossed it diagonally, aiming for el-Sukhur (wrongly called J. Arban on the map). At 7.15 a.m. we reached the east bank of el-Khubt, and turned right, up a side-valley, for ten minutes, on to the plain (Magrah) of el-Darraj, a scrub-covered area leading right up to the feet of el-Sukhur. We halted at 7.40 a.m. in the middle of a rain shower, which lasted intermittently from 6 till 8.50 a.m. In el-Darraj were some half-dozen tents of Waish Billi, with sheep, goats, horses and camels. There has been no rain to speak of in the Bluwiya this year, and plenty in the J uheiniya, and, therefore, many of the Billi have come over the border peaceably to pasture. These tents were watering from Heiran. We left el-Darraj halt at 10 a.m. and moved across to the feet of the Sukhur. We wound up a valley till we were between them and the isolated Sakhara south-west of them, and then scrambled for fifteen minutes up rock shelves and along faults over a knife ridge and down a stony bed, past a huge boulder all hammered over with tribal marks, into the basin of Wadi Heiran. Che Sukhur are huge striated masses of a reddish coloured volcanic rock, grey on the surface ; th'e Sakhara is like a brown water melon standing on end : on its south and east faces it is absolutely smooth, and dome-headed, polished till it shines, with fine cracks running up and across it, like seams. I he height above the plain must be about 700 feet. At 11.5 a.m. we were over this pass and in a narrow valley, between granite outcrops. This led into another valley, and so to another, till we entered Wadi Heiran (40° to 200°, its course) at noon. The well lay some way on our right, down the valley. We crossed the valley, rode up a tributary, and then till 12.45 p.m. went up and down over granite shards piled up in tiny 50-foot mounds all round us in wild confusion. There was no road and we kept no direction, but wandered where we could. Wadis ran in and out everywhere. At 12.45 p.m. we descended sharply into Seil Dhrufi, a wooded valley 100 yards wide, along which we went at 120 . At 1.30 p.m.' we got to the head of our branch of the valley, and ascended a narrow and difficult hill-path, with broken steps of rock, difficult for camels, round a shoulder of Jebel Dhrufi (it is a range) to a saddle from which a steep) but short descent led and across a valley sweeping down from north-east towards the sea. The ground again became a confusion of small mounds and valleys till a new watershed was readied at 1.40 p.m. This was easv and led us to a big valley running south ; we bent on the— 234 — . , i Kv tho rock-wall down which we had left at ^ht an K C! j ( oro . e which grew very narrow, and come. We turned J cUm b the S ide o£ the ‘A 6 , I^the Trth f The ascent was very steep, unfit for laden clels owing to the rough surface and the narrowness of the cameib, owi g qiones above and below. At 2.20 p.m. we mchirthe 6 watershed and descended a sandy valley into W H‘inbal a large well-wooded tributary of W. Heiran. We topped for twenty minutes to gather for the camels the luxunant stoppea -'.i,, i iav 0 f the hills and then crossed the wadi and' marched up a tributary of its east bank, W Kite,, This is a stony valley with a good hard surface (no rocks), about loo yards wide from hill to hill, and well wooded with th.im We marched up till 4.15 p.m. and then halted; the valley had drawn in a little in the last half-hour. The hills on the south were small; but to the north is a very large hill Jidwa, about six miles long and perhaps three miles distant, flanking the valley with a steep and high hog s back, running 1 /H a/'vn+n March IS. Started at 3.30 a.m. and readied the head of W. iiitan m a few minutes and went over a narrow pass between rock masses (steep but not difficult; too narrow for wheels) into Sell Jidha. which runs into W. Amk. It has sharp hills each side. At 4.30 a.m. we diverged to the right up a gorge limning south. Ttu s was from eight to ten feet wide between its cliffs, but the bed of the torrent was all encumbered with fallen stones and tiees, so that the passage was difficult. At 4.50 a.m. we reached its head and found a gentle valley running away south. At 4.50 a.m.. when the Wadi turned west about a mile above Kir Reimi, which is only ihemail in the wadi bed. The water smelt one foul smell, and tasted equally unpleasantly but quite differently. We had high hills on the east and smaller hills to the west. We started again at 8.30 a.m., leaving Wadi Reimi by a side wadi to the south, which ascended to a gentle watershed, from which we had a fine view down the broad and green Wadi Amk, which passes through Khuff to the sea. This branch of it runs 150° and is bounded by considerable hills. At 9.10 a.m. the valley turned more to the east, and at 9.20 a.m. received a large feeder (on the main stream) from the north, and bore off 180°. We cut across the confluence, at 70°, making for the centre of a great hill in front of us. At 9.30 a.m. we found a side valley and at 9.40 a.m. went over a patch of soft white sand in its bed. At 10.15 a.m. we entered Wadi Dhuhub el-Amk, coming from the north to join W. Amk. We went up a side valley from it, with high hills on the right about a quarter of a mile off, and then climbed a sandy valley between piles of the curiously warped ^ grey granite, looking like cold toffee, that one finds frequently in the Hejaz. This valley led us to the foot of one of these great stone piles, up which runs a natural ramp and staircase, badly broken.twisting and difficult for camels, but short. This brought us at 10.30 a.m. back into W. Dhuhub again, above its northern bend. WeMlowed the valley till 11.38 a.m. (its head). It runs about 120°, has low hills on the right, and high hills on the left of the road, and is full of quite large trees ; there are water pools in the gorges about it. There were a number of Merawin tents here and there, with plentiful sheep and goats. At 11.15 a.m. the valley narrowed and began (from being excellent smooth shingle) to get stony. At 11.25 a.m. it became a mere ravine, on the north bank of which an execrable track led us up to the watershed between W. Dhuhub el-Amk and W. Marrakh. The view from the crest was beautiful, but the descent dangerous. We reached the foot at 11.45 a.m., and found ourselves in an absolutely straight valley, running steep!}’ downhill at 130° towards a depression ahead, between two regular walls of moderate hills. At 12.25 p.m. a large side-valley entered on the right, showing, through its break in the hills, a parallel range a couple of miles away and broken ground behind. There was a corresponding (but small) break on the left. The hill walls then opened out in a double sweep like an amphitheatre of grey stone with veins of dark red brown granite running over them in up-and-down lines, looking like cockscombs, or a rustic scenic railway ; and in front came down a steep black wall of harra, with a low hill of brown granite in the middle of the line. We halted at 1.10 p.m. under the trees, shortly after passing a pile-circle of uncut stones about forty feet in diameter, with a central cairn, and some small square piles round about it, outside the circle. These were the first stone remains I had noted (bar simple cairns) on the way from Wejh, but from now onwards to the mouth of Wadi Ais they were to grow increasingly frequent. In parts of the harra and its valleys are distinct remains of old villages and rough terrace constructions for cultivation. The Juheinah ascribe all these to the Beni Hillal. and never put up even a cairn of more than three or four stones themselves. Their onlv stone constructions are little square box- houses of the type they call ” nawamis in parts of Sinai. These little places are made to shelter the young lambs and kids, and are put up, as needed, by the shepherd boys. We have now got into a much more fertile area than the Tihamah or the hills near Wejh. My camel men got milk to-day in the Merawi tents—the first milk they had tasted for two years— and this plain of fine quartz gravel and coarse sand is all studded over with a stubbly grass, in tufts sixteen inches high, of a slate oreen colour, white at the tips. The heat is very great, but there is a faint cool wind, which, however, has little effect on the plague of flies. I have with me a Syrian, a Moroccan, a Merawi, four Rifaa, and three men from Aneizah, Rass, and Zilfi respectively. The last describes himself as an eyewitness of Shakespear’s death. He says he was with Ibn Sand’s artillery, looking through his field glasses and very conspicuous, since he was wearing full British uniform, . , „ii Up W qs therefore easily picked out, and and a sun-helmet over • h lmet was taken into Medina, and was shot at h a u Moslems that I bn Sand was a publicly exlnbite 1 Christians into his country. Syed in the Semi, with an inscription pointing its moral. We started again at 2.35 p.m. (120°) across^ Wadi Marrakh which runs out to westward to the Makassar mst south ol Harrat tthich run entered Harrat Gara. It hlls a wadi, running north “d falls down in steps or waves to Wadi Marukh, where 't is cut short. We had mounted its first terrace by 3 2o p.m and found a small sand and grass plain m the lava of the second ‘tec We then turned east, up Wadi Gara, which is one of the main sources of the lava How. The lava was in a great rope, down the centre of the valley, whose water had cut tor itself a , eec bed in the granite each side. At 4 p.m a stream of lava came in from the south, and we crossed it, and the edge of the main stream, and other side streams, very slowly and painfully till 4.50 p.m. The north bank o£ the wadi was a straight line ol hills At 4.50 p.m. we ] assed a first crater, ol fine silted black ash and earth, just south of the road, and at 5.10 p.m. halted at the tent of Sheikh Fahad el-Hamshah, who produced bowl after bowl of milk, till 10 p.m., and then rice and a dismembered sheep. Camels and men all very tired, for the going over the harm is vile. Harm looks like scrambled eggs that have gone very wrong, o nri affWk thp worst ^oinff imaginable for man or beast. March 14. Started at 5.40 a.m. and at 6.25 turned 120° with the valley, and then sharply to the left up the slope between a group of cones of black ash from a huge crater to the south. At 7.10 a.m. reached the watershed (Has Gara) and went down the eastern slope of the valley, passing the remains of what was perhaps a fort, of rough uncut stones, rectangular, about 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Walls about three feet thick, and now not more than four feet high. Descent was very bad ; at 8 a.m. left the main valley and stopped at 8.20 a.m., at the end of the harm, up a side- valley, in the tents of Sheikh Mualeh, a relative of Fahad. We halted till 9.35 a.m. and then marched 120° till 10 a.m. when we reached the head of the valley, across remains of old settlement and fields. At 10.10 a.m. we had crossed a small spur into a tiny valley between hills, which led us at once to a kind of chimney, up which the camels had to climb till 10.25 a.m. It was dangerous riding up, and most of us walked. From the top there was an easy run down Wadi Shweita till 11.20 a.m., when it ran into Wadi Murramiya, one of the most important tributaries from the Juheiniya into Wadi Hamdh. The wadi is filled all across the middle with bristling harm, but a clear path exists each side. We marched along the west edge till 11.50 a.m., when we struck round a bay of lava, and camped under a tree in a grassy dell.In the hollows and sandy places of the harm you find wonderful vegetation, which affords the best grazing in the country. Flowers grow freely, and the grass is really green and juicy. The green looks the more wonderful in comparison with the blue-black naked crusts and twists of jagged rock all around. Harra seems to be either loose piles of fist- or head-sized stones, rubbed together and rounded, possible for camels ; or solid, almost crystallized, fronds of rock, which are impossible to cross. We mounted again at 2.15 p.m. and crossed the remaining harra in a few minutes to a flat plain, containing stone circles and cairns. At 2.40 p.m. this came to its' end, and we turned 125° up an easy. pass. At 3 p.m. reached the watershed (broad and flat) and entered Wadi Cheft, which is half a mile wide, straight, overgrown with brushwood and lined with hills. At its lower end (3.45 p.m.) was a field about a quarter of a mile square, ploughed two years ago. This was the first field I had seen in the Juheiniya, though many others are reported. The field ended in a harra which we crossed—the worst road yet experienced on the march. We have had many bad roads, but this is awful. The path zigzagged across the harra, which is very deep and piled up and broken. At 4.30 p.m. we reached the southern side (it was going north) and climbed a low watershed into a smooth valley, which turned down towards W. Murramiya, at 4.40 p.m. We climbed a feeder for a few minutes, and then rode down into W. Murramiya. Its central harra was easy to cross, and took five minutes only, and we then climbed up its further bank—it is here a plain about two miles wide, covered with large trees (W. Ghadirat Murramiya) till near the eastern hill border. Along this we marched, by a beautiful road, till dark. We could see the lava a mile and a half to our right, and behind it a break in the hills and high ranges in the distance. At 6 p.m. it got dark and a hill rose up in the centre of the valley. About 6.30 p.m. we crossed an imperceptible watershed, and rode down W. Tleib, till we stopped at 7 p.m. March 15. Rode at 5.30 a.m. down the valley, which became moreand more green as it got lower. The hills each side were low at first, but then J. Elif on the right, and later J. Keshra on the left, raised the level. At 8 a.m. we passed a conical hill in the valley, below Keshra, and at 8.30 a.m. went over a low watershed into a parallel valley ; at 9.20 a.m. this opened into Wh Ais at Abu Markha, where the valley is about a mile wide, more thickly wooded than most Hejaz valleys, and with a great 30-foot deep water hole to an underground stream in its side. Wadi Ais is here sharply limited by hills on its south side, but is open on its north, with all the Tleib system of valleys running down into it. I found Sidi Abdullah at Abu Markha, ju&gt;t dismounting from his camel, after his march here from Bir el-Amri,Time taken from Wejh to Wadi Ais : 47 hours. Road was a bve-road, impossible for any but pack-animals and not for regular or extended use by them. Average speed of camels about three miles per hour. ||.—Abu Markka to Wejh. When Sidi Abdullah had made arrangements for a nightly cutting of the railway, l decided that 1 might return to Wejtn I started therefore at 6 a.m., with three A gey 1, and Mohammed el-Gadhi with about a dozen of his followers, hherif Shakir put us on our way for the first half-hour. At 7 a m. we reached the low watershed into W. fleib. which we had crossed on the journey down to Wadi Ais. We marched across Wadi Tleib, and up a steep side-valley to the north of Jebel Keshra. At 8.55 a.m. we reached the head of this and went down an easy slope into W. Saura, turning a little right out of our road to some tents at 9.20 a.m., where we halted.' They fed us very hospitably, and at 12.50 p.m. we rode across Wadi Saura, which comes from the east, and up a northern branch of it to the common origin of W. Osman and Wadi Bedia, on the eastern slope of J. Riam, at 2.5 p.m. ^ On the western slope of Riam is the common source of W. Tleib and W. Murramiya. We rode down W. Osman (which is fit for gun- wheels, except for about 150 yards at its head, where rock cutting would be necessary), twisting and turning with it, till 5 p.m., when, at a right-angled turn, we saw on our left Magrah el-Ithrara, whose western half drains into Murramiya. We halted at 6.15 p.m. in the mouth of W. Geraia. Rode at 5.5 a.m. and at once Wadi Osman widened out. We rode across it to the tents of Dakhilallah at 5.55 a.m. We had to stop there till 1.35 p.m. while they prepared saffron-rice and a lamb. We then rode up a side-vallejy and down into Osman again at 2.15 p.m. We followed it down (it was not so zigzag in its course as it had been yesterday) till 4 p.m., when we turned abruptly to the right, and found ourselves in Wadi Hamdh, which here flows in a narrow rock-walled valley, about 200 yards wide. The valley is bare at the edges, of hard damp sand. In the middle it is packed with aslam wood, the ground being leprous, and of a white salty colour, with soft bulbous patches where bushes grow or grew. The water-beds are cut in a clean light clayey soil from one to eight feet deep, and in the central one was a ghadir (brought by W. Osman) about two feet deep, 250 feet long, and twelve feet broad. The water was sweet and good. Half a mile above the ghadir, Wadi Hamdh ran into Jebel Muraishida, and turned abruptly north to get round it. Faqeir is said to be about seven miles up. From Ghadir Osman we rode at 6.30 p.m. along Hamdh, and at 7.15 p.m. were opposite the break where the road from Wadi Osman to Aqila (TJglai reaches the Hamdh. Our course now 280°. At 7.30 p.m. weturned 300°, and at 8.20 j).m. diverged from the bed of Hamdh to the left, to sleep. Wadi Hamdh is clearly distinguished from any other Hejaz wadi (except W. Yambo) that I have seen, by the damp chill that strikes up from its valley. This is of course most obvious at night, when the mist rises, and everything glistens with damp ; but even in daytime Wadi Haradh feels raw and cold and unnatural. Started at 5,20 a.m. along Wadi Hamdh. At (&gt;.15 a.m. Wadi Murramiya came in on the left; it forms by far the best road from Hamdh to Ais, and from Wejh to Sidi Abdullah’s camp offers the quickest and smoothest road. We rode down it, into the brushwood of W. Hamdh, where we found large pools of rain water, some fresh, others gone very green and stale. We then crossed the valley, left Wadi Dura on our right (the confluence of Dura and Murramiya makes the plain of Aqila, whose brackish well is the only permanent supply in the district till Faqeir is reached) and rode past Bir Aqila (on the left, in the Hamdh valley) over a low watershed, to the landing ground at Urn Jarad at 7.20 a.m. From this point Major Ross’s map is available. It is admirable, f rode till W. Methar at 10.15 a.m., camped till 3 p.m , and then rode slowly (one of us fell off his camel when racing and broke his arm and had to be left behind) till 0.20 p.m., when we halted, with a narrow gorge to the south in which are rock-pools of water. Started at 5 a.m. Halted at 6 a.m. in Wadi Melha, north of the road, which contains good water pools. Rode again, 0.45 a.m. till 10.10 a.m., when we halted till 2.20 p.m. We then marched to Bir ibn Rilada in hhauthla, at l.oO P ,riK There are at least five wells in and near W. Khauthla, and about them are small plants of horn-palm, one or two grown-up how- palms, and, at Bir ibn Rifada, the drying remains of the palm and vegetable garden that Suleiman began to make. 1 he wen water had a purgative effect on our camels.^ We rode again at 5.30 p.m. and camped between the Raals at &lt; .30 p.m. Started again at 1.36 a.m. and rode till 8.45 a m. in the south edge o£ Murra. From Sam, when men and camels were all tired, it seemed fit to the boy. Mohammed el-Gadhi, to run races. . o e took most of his clothes off, got off his camel and chal enged an of us mounted to race him to a clump of trees on the slope ahead fora pound English. All the party started off at once; the distance turned out about three-quarters of a mile, uphill, over heavy sand, which 1 expect was more than Mohammed had bargained toi though he won by inches, he was absolutely done an&lt; £ bleeding from his' mouth and nose. Some of our camels tve - very fast, and when racing in a mob, as we were, they do then best. We put him on his camel, at 11a.m.; when we started off to march to Wejh at 5 p.m, he was quite fit and a f“ l £ ‘“f all the little jests that had enlivened the march horn ' If you come up quietly behind a camel, poke a stick up its tump, ami screech, it phmges off at a gallop, very disconcerting to its— 240 —- rider. It is also good fun to cannon another galloping camel into a tree ; either the tree goes down (Hejaz trees are very unstable thino-s) or the rider is scratched, or best of all, is swept off his saddle and left hanging on a thorny branch. This counts a bull, and is verv popular with the rest of the party. The Bedu are odd people. Travelling with them is unsatis factory for an Englishman unless he has patience deep and wide as the sea. They are absolute slaves of their appetites, with no stamina of mind, drunkards for coffee, milk or water, gluttons for stewed meat, shameless beggars for tobacco. A cigarette goes round four men in the tent before it is finished ; it would be intolerable manners to smoke it all. They dream for weeks before and after their rare sexual exercises, and spend their days titillating themselves and their friends with bawdy tales. Had the circumstances of their life given them greater resources or oppor tunity, the Beduins would be mere sensualists. It is the poverty of Arabia which makes them simple, continent and enduring. If they suspect you want to drive them, either they are mulish or they go away : if you know them, and have the time and give the trouble to present things their way, then they in turn will do your pleasure. Whether the results you gain are worth the effort you put forth, no man knoweth. I think Europeans could not or would not spend the time and thought and tact their Sheikhs and Emirs expend each day, on such meagre objects. Their processes are clear, their minds moving as one’s own moves, with nothing incomprehensible or radically different, and they will follow us, if we can endure with them, and play their game. The pity is, we break down with exasperation, and throw them over. T.E.L. In Sherif Abdullah'* Camp. Captain L\ E. Lawrence, whose report on his journeys to and from Sherif Abdullah’s camp, as well as on the two chief raids in which he took part, have appeared separately, sent also an account of his stay in the camp itself. From this we take the following notes :— Abdullah had a force of about 3,000 men, mostly Ateibah. ^ avvreuce thought very inferior as fighting men to f 1 -i * u ^ e ^ Iia h ? being unadulterated Bedouins. Their &gt; heikhsare ignorant men, lacking in influence and character, and f w\ appear to be without interest in the campaign. They also knew nothing of the country they are in. Abdullah himself was eac mg rather an irresponsible hedonistic existence. His tastes appear to be pronouncedly literary. He take great interest in e war in Europe and follows the operations on the Somme and course of . European politics most closely (through 1 a )1( 1 spapers which he spends most of the day in reading).1 was surprised to find, says Capt. Lawrence, “that he knew the family relationships of the Royal Houses of Europe and the names and characters of their ministers. He believes that he could make himself supreme m Yemen. If he succeeded, “it v\ ould transform the Sherif’s state from a loose hegemony of Bedouin tribes into a populous, wealthy and vigorous kingdom of villagers and townspeople.” Capt. Lawrence adds, with justice, that all past movements of importance in Arabia have been the work of the settled peoples, not of the tribes. Sheikhs Shakir and Dakhilallah el-Gadhi were the two outstanding personalities in the camp. Both are men of action, and the first has an authority hardly inferior to that of the King or his sons. The Ateibah worship him. Dakhilallah is hereditary lawman of the Juheinah and possesses some science, speakinb Turkish well. In fact, he was with the Turks up to December last and came down with them to Nakhl Mubarak. He seems to be a man of energy, resolution and persistence. In regard to railway raids, Capt. Lawrence gives a rough list of those carried out during his stay from March 24 to April (i. “ March 24. Bueir. Sixty rails dynamited and telegraph cut. April 27. Istabl Antar. 29. Jedahah. 25. Abu el-Naam. Twenty-five rails dynamited, water- tower, two station buildings seriously damaged by shell fire, seven box-wagons and wood store; and tents destroyed by fire, tele graph cut, engine and bogie damaged. Fifteen rails dynamited and telegraph cut. Ten rails dynamited, telegraph cut, five Turks killed. Five rails dynamited, telegraph cut. Eleven rails dynamited, telegraph cut. 200 rails blown up, four-arched bridge destroyed, telegraph cut. Locomotive mined and put out of action temporarily. Twenty-two rails cut, culvert blown up, telegraph cut. “ The Turks lost about thirty-six killed, and we took some seventy prisoners and deserters during the operations. “ From April 7 a regular service of dynamiters was begun, from Ain Turaa, working against the Mudahrij-Abu el-Naam section, and from Bueir against the Istabl Antar-Bowat section. Dynamiters have been ordered to blow up not more than five rails per night and do something every night. The result of the first three nights’ work was satisfactory, but no later details have reached me.” 31. 3. 5. 6. ( 1 . Bueir. Hadiyah. Mudahrij. Bueii ; \— — Lu conclusion, Capt. Lawrence |*ys a tribute to Abdullah's sincerity and earnestness, while he thinks Inn, not a military commander or a man of action in any way He is too fond of Xsure and, in a sense, evidently too civilized tor Ins present wild work Capt. Lawrence, however, got him to do a good eal-to pay up the Ateibah (whose allowances were m arrears), , &gt; take an interest in his guns and machine-guns, to send out Ins dynamite parties, and to begin to prepare tor a general move towards the railway. The report ends with an optimistic forecast. u reirards the situation at Medina, I think the great bulk of the troops and practically all stores have been evacuated northward in small parties by rail. The programme for a route- march of the main body to el-Ula has (wisely, I think, for the Turks) been abandoned, and the fall of Medina is now merely a question of when the Arabs like to put an end to the affair. The Turks have little food, but so small a garrison that the question has less importance. No food is going in from the north, so that sooner or later starvation will ensue. Till it does, the Arabs will probably not enter the town, since the Emirs are all anxious to avoid ‘ warlike action against the place itself, for religious reasons.’ Railway Raiding. Interim reports, covering the period between April 17 and May 2, have been received from Colonel Newcombe.^ Thanks to his persistence, he succeeded in effecting his object of cutting telegraph and rails five or six times, but his report is mainly a record of disappointments, of missed opportunities and of good plans spoilt by the indiscipline, instability of purpose, cowardice and general untrustworthiness, not only ol the Bedouin forces accompanying him, but also of the Sheikhs at their head. Explosives promised are not sent, rendezvous arranged are not kept, desertions take place at the critical moment, supplies are not forwarded, and so on ; a dreary catalogue of the difficulties experienced by trained European officers in carrying out, with inadequate, human material, plans which would be perfectly easy of execution if only reasonable co-operation on the part of subordinates could be secured. Colonel Newcombe was working in the district round Khishm Sanaa, Muadhdham and Abu Taqa. The damage done to the line consisted in removing or destroying a few rails and lengths of telegraph wire, and was never so serious as to require more than a few hours work by the trolley-parties sent out promptly by the Turks. Colonel Newcombe more than once says that the obstacles put by the Turks in the way of his efforts at destruction are far less serious than those proceeding from his own people.It appears from information obtained from a few prisoners captured that food difficulties are considerable. Trains' pass daily in spite of the cutting of the line, but they only carry troops and no food. The majority of Arab troops, therefore, and many Turks are anxious to desert, if only a way can be found. Aden Protectorate. Haul into the Fadhli Country. The Resident, Aden, reports that on April 18, when the 33rd Punjabis were in harbour awaiting naval escort to East Africa, they were used for a landing at Wadi Bana in order to raid Musemir in the Fadhli country. He appends an account of the expedition by Captain Reilly, who accompanied it as Assistant Political Officer. I left Aden in the troopship 4 Purnea,’ on the afternoon of April 18, with the force under the command of Major Graham. I took with me Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar and his slave. Mohammed Marzuk. Mr. Ali Ibrahim accompanied me as interpreter. We reached the shore near el-Kaud early next morning, and 1 disembarked in the first boat from the ‘Purnea, and proceeded at once to el-Kaud. I was. however, too late to arrest Mohammed bin Abdullah and Salim bin Abdullah, whose houses are at this village. The former has a dar into which I went. He had left his women in it, but he himself was said to have gone to the Fulesi country two days earlier. Salim bin Abdullah had a “ Kutcha ” house. He had left that morning on seeing the ships. Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar was welcomed^ by those villagers who were present, but the majority had fled. I he Arabs reported that two camel sowars had left at dawn for Lahej to report our arrival, and that the Fadhli Sultan s son, Abdullah bin Husein, had gone personally to Ali Said Pasha to ask foi assistance. The people said that the I urks had left their post at Ba Sharara six days previously, and had gone to Harur, a party of them having gone on to el-Raha. Sultan Husein was said to be at Shukra. Salim bin Abdullah’s house was destroyed with the assent of Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar, who suggested that it would be a good thing to destroy Ba Shahara also. “ We then proceeded to Musemir, where we found that most of the villagers had fled, but those who remained were friendly, and the headman Ali Mansur (also called Ali Mohammed) invited Major Graham and the officers into his house, as the force rested here for a short time. Ali bin Ahmed, the radhli Sultan’s son-in-law, whom I had instructions to arrest and whose house is at this village, was said to have left that morning with his family. While we were at Musemir information244 — was brought that the Fadhli’s men were then removing ammunition and stores from the dar at Ba Shahara. This dar was occupied by the Lurks when tiiey were at Ba &gt;shahara. On receipt of this information (which was given to me through Mr. Ali Ibrahim). Major B rah am immediately marched to Ba Shahara. On our arrival at the dar a few Arabs opened fire on the scouts and then retired to a distance of about 500 yards, where they were joined by others and from there they ao-ain opened fire. Meanwhile we had occupied the dar, in which was found nine boxes of M.H. ammunition and a quantity of grain. The Arabs were driven off with the assistance of two machine-guns mounted on the top of the dar. They were said to belong to the Marquashi tribe of the Fadhlis, and were presumably covering their retirement with stores which they had removed from the fort. 1 do not know whether there were any casualties amongst them. Major Graham consulted me about the desirability of destroying the &lt;1ar. As we had been fired upon by 7 the Arabs in charge of it, and as it is used by the Turks as a post, and might be so used again, I considered that it would be a good thing to demolish it. There were no means available of blowing it up, but it was partially demolished, and this work was continued next morning by the guns of H.M.S. ‘Topaz.’ The ammunition found was brought away, and the grain destroyed. Grain found in the villagers’ houses was not touched. Meanwhile it was reported that two guns (smooth bore muzzle-loading field-guns of old British make) had been found at the village ol Zangebar, and these Major Graham had blown up after consulting me. I he force then returned to el-Kaud, which was reached at about 6.45 p.m., and there we were rejoined by Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar and his slave, together with six women, four men and four children, dependents of the Sultan, whom he wished to bring to Aden. I he force spent the night on the sea-shore, and was re-embarked early this morning, whereupon the “Purnea ' left for Aden. \\ hile ashore 1 was informed that the F’ulesi Sultan had been captured by the Turks. The people in all the villages through v Inch we passed had been alarmed at our approach, and most had » uii away ; but those who remained seemed friendly and not at all displeased at the destruction of the dar, Sultan Ahmed el-Mehdar on the contrary appearing to be very glad of it. The people seemed dissatisfied with the conduct of the Turks in interfering with their kafilax.”NOTES. Oman* Muscat i©ports (up to the end of: March) that there are signs of the local u Imam’s ” popularity being on the decline as a result of his efforts to raise zcihcit in advance. Rain has been scanty and the pomegranate harvest a failure. The spirit of rebellion, therefore, is not only quiescent, but possibly dying down. The arrival in Muscat of Ali ibn Saif, agent of Sheikh Hamyar ibn Nasir, as a guest of the Sultan, is regarded as symptomatic of some attempt at a pacific arrangement being on foot. South Arabia. Aden reports, under date May 8, that the Kaiti Sultan of Makalla is no nearer a settlement of his difficulties with the Kathiri of the Hadhramaut, except for the one fact, that Ali Said Pasha has written to the latter stating his inability to arm them or in other ways assist them. On the other hand, the . Aulaki Sheikhs, from both the Tipper and Low r er districts and also from Bir Id, are reported to have gathered at Makalla, to make an agreement with the Kaiti, under which one shall assist another against the Turks. The Sherif of Behan has congratulated us on the capture of Baghdad, and says that he has protected the Kadi Atik against a Turkish plot on his life. It is rumoured, but not yet confirmed, that the old Fadhli Sultan has been deposed at last in favour of Abdul Kadim, has accepted the situation, and hns withdrawn to his &lt;la,r in the hills. Yemen. Aden sends us news, under date May 15, which suggests that earlier information (see iNlo. 37 p. 556 and No. 38 p. 23) respecting a son of the Imam Ahihya leading an anti-Turk movement was erroneous in one important detail at least. The leader, Mohammed Yahya, is no son of the Imam, but a seyyid of the Qasim house of Sanaa (the present Imam belongs to the Shehara branch of that house), and is perhaps the same who has been Emir of Midan in the Hasliid country. His full name is now given as Mohammed Yahya ibn el-Hadi ibn el-Muayyad billah el-Qasim. No doubt he is the individual indicated in Mustafa Idrisi’s report printed in our No. 30 p. 445. He seems to have numerous and influential support and will probably be heard of again, for, according to latest information, his faction is gaining strength. It is thought that Idrisi may come to terms j with it in order to oust his enemy, the reigning Imam, and to j secure, as his price, the Yemen Tihamah district which he covets. ] By himself he seems unlikely to realize his ambitions. The j Turks are evidently holding him up on the south, having moved, . it is reported, their Hodeidah and Zebid garrisons up to Jarb on | the Abs border. The Hashid and Bekil tribes are said to be behind the revolutionary movement ; and if these will fight for it, they will be more effective than if called out at the bidding of Idrisi.The results o£ our blockade of Yemen ports grow more and more unsatisfactory owing to the exception of Idnsi s ports and lack of control by IdnsTs officers over the coastal trade. On May 6, boats from our patrol raided the dhow anchorage oi Dubab south of Mokha and destroyed twenty craft ; and on Vlav 8 twelve dhows and some stores were destroyed at Ibn Vbbas’ opposite Kamaran, in retaliation for frequent firing on Uni Hhdhdhal and the Amaral. Under date May 17, Baghdad informs us that Fahad Ibn Hadhdhal lias, at last, given definite proof of friendly sentiments in two messages to the C.P.O. The active co-operation of this Paramount Chief of the south-western Anezah, though it may not he given until we have pressed the Turks a little further back up the Euphrates and so opened sufficient markets to the . Amarat, will be of great value on both sides of the Hamad desert. From the same source we learn that the 'fezidis of Jebel^ Sin jar, in north mid-Mesopotamia, are prepared to come out actively on nnr side. &lt; jeneral Maude and the Shiah Holy C ities. Owing to errors of ciphering and transmission, information lias reached us in a mutilated state from Baghdad under date May 20, to the effect that General Maude and someone else (Mr. Storrs ?) have paid an official visit to Kerbela, Nejef and Kufa. In the first they had a cordial reception, from both the towns people and the Ulema, and found that the town had preserved its shrine and treasure practically intact. At Nejef the populace came out to greet them. There and at Kerbela the intermission of the pilgrimage has caused much poverty, and a sum of mone}’ was given by the General for immediate distribution. At Kufa the principal mujtahids received the visitors. All these towns people are well armed and defy the Bedouins : but the Ulema would like to see less warlike conditions re-established, under the guarantee of British troops not at present available. Meanwhile the town sheikhs have been made responsible.SECRET. Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, May 31, 1917. No. 52. SUMMARY. ARABIA.— Hejaz («) A Year of Revolt. (b) Intelligence. Yemen The New Movement. ABYSSINIA.— Summary of Intelligence. NOTES.— (a) Ajeimi Saadun. (A) Wejh Map. K. Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.ARABIA. Hejaz. A Year of Revolt. The 9th Shaaban, which falls this year on May 30, is the anniversary of Emir Hnsein’s definite rupture wilh the Turks. His standard indeed, had been raised four days earlier outside Medina by his sons, Ali and Feisal ; but the 9th Shaaban, which heard the first shots fired at Mecca and Jiddah, has been adopted as the official Day of Independence. On this occasion the following telegram has been sent by the High (Commissioner of Egypt to King Husein : “ On this fortunate 9th Shaaban, on which day, last year, Your Majesty’s troops victoriously took the field at Mecca and Jiddah, I beg to offer Your Majesty my cordial congratulations on the completion of a first year of liberty and my sincere hopes that the years to come may be equally fortunate for your Majesty and the Arab Nation.” The outbreak of the Hejaz Revolt, as is well known, was premature. The original plan was for August, but the Emir’s hand was forced by the appearance in Medina of a picked body of 3,000 Turks, destined to escort the Stotzingen Mission. Neither he nor we were at all ready in early June, 1916, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that a minimum of sufficient assistance in material could be scraped together to ensure initial success. But for the prompt co-operation of the Sirdar, who sent indispensable artillery from Khartum, and of the S.N.O., Red Sea Patrol, both Jiddah and Mecca might have defied attack for long enough ; nor would Taif have fallen in time for the Pilgrimage in early October. The comparative ease with which early successes over considerable bodies of trained troops in fortified positions were obtained, was, of course, due to the isolation of the Turks in Southern Hejaz, some 300 miles from any base connected by a decent system of communication with the rest of the Empire, and also to their very inadequate equipment of munitions and other supplies. If there existed any misconception about these successes, it was soon to be corrected by what happened at Qunfudah, at Medina, and on the Darb es-Sultani. That the Heiaz Bedouins were simply quernleros, and not of good quality at that, had been amply demonstrated, even in the early sieges; and it was never in doubt that they would not attack or withstand ^Turkish regulars unless these were at the last extremity. Our efforts, therefore, have been directed, almost from the first, to finding, in addition to material assistance, some elements out of which a trained force could be formed. Syrian refugees, Arab prisoners of war, and a few ex-Ottoman soldiers of Arab race were the only material which we could— 250 supply but only a small proportion of what seemed available in these categories proved ultimately o - Released Hejaz itself could add some townsfolk, ® &amp;e f prisoners and the like. In one way or another by the end of die year between two and three thousand partly trained men under very heterogeneous Moslem officers have been put into the field;'but, distributed 'as they are among at least three distinct annies, they are not yet sufficient to solve the problems which Medina, with its outposts and railway line of com munications, presents. More such material, however, is being steadily recruited, the pace having notably quickened since the vindication of British arms by the capture of Baghda . We reach, therefore, the end of the year with Medina and the Heiaz Railway still held by the Turks, together with the posts of Bir el-Mashi (about thirty miles to the south-south-west at the bifurcation of the Gfaha and I ura roads) and Manjur (some fifteen miles south-west on the Sultani Road). Medina itself has been evacuated by at least half its civil population and is very short of food, none apparently being put into it by the railway, though this is still intermittently open. The latter has been greatly weakened as a means of communication, both by damage to the permanent way, now repaired in many places with 'defective material, and by the deterioration of the rolling stock. But no station has yet been taken and held by the Arabs, and such a stoppage of traffic, as a trained force astride the line could ensure, has never been brought about. All the rest of the Hejaz, including Midian with its immediate hinterland, acknowledges King Husein, and his is the only effective government in it. But, so long as Medina remains linked up with the rest of the Ottoman Empire, and the Turks hold the heads of the three coast-roads towards Mecca, not only has the immediate end of the Revolt not been wholly gained, but it cannot be said to be impossible for the enemy to retrieve the whole province. Had the Hejaz Expeditionary Force formed last autumn a flying column of the old pre-Turco-German type under a dashing commander, it might well have re-occupied Mecca for a time at any rate, for the Arabs could not have stopped it by themselves, and would probably have called for the assistance of foreign troops too late. What was possible then is still not quite out of the question, should the railway remain in being, and the Turks succeed in reinforcing and re-provisioning their Expeditionary Force by next autumn. At present however, this Force undoubtedly lias not the man-power, the transport, the munitions or the morale to do more than just hold its own in place. ^ D.G.H.InteUitjence. King Husein is sending back the Amarat messengers with replies to I bn Hadhdhal and I bn Mijlad, in which he states that the Arabs and the British are one and urges all the former to render the latter every assistance in their power. He desired that Colonel Wilson should add similar letters under his own hand, but instructions were sent to the latter not to comply, it being doubtful what construction might be put by independent Arabs on such statements and exhortations signed by a British representative. From more than one source we have been informed that the Turks are reinforcing the artillery of their Hejaz Expeditionary Force, which suffered rather severely at Bir el-Mashi. It is hoped that operations against the railway may, at least, delay these reinforcements. On May 16 one of our planes Hew over el-Ala and bombed the station buildings and also a freight-train, which started for the south on seeing its danger. The enemy garrison appeared to have decreased since the end of April. Spasmodic raids on the line continue in the Muadhdliam neighbourhood and the enemy is reported to be running short of rails, bolts, nuts, etc. We are informed that the 129th Regiment, after being depleted to make up the companies of two battalions of the 55th which remain at Bir el-Mashi, has been withdrawn north to guard the railway. Colonel Newcombe, who has continued to encounter great difficulties with his following of Bedouins and Bishawa in prosecuting attacks on the line, has been to Jiddah and to Cairo. Colonel Wilson has gone to Wejh to decide the question of transferring the R.F.C. flight to Yambo. If the transference is made, it is hoped to establish an advance flying base a,t Bir Abbas, and a landing ground near Bir el-Mashi ; but it is very doubtful whether communication by car can be established between the former and Yambo. [Later advices state that, for the present, the flight will remain at Wejh.] Some useful information has been given by Ramadan Eff., an Arab Officer, who deserted about May o from neai Medina. He was O.C. Camel Corps there, and had ‘been much trusted by Fakhri Pasha. He is a Bedu by birth, from Deir el-Zor district, his father being a sheikh. He and his brother, with sons of other Bedu sheikhs, were educated at the Stambul Military School. (1 ).—Turkish Forces. 55th Regiment. One battalion, Manjur.

Ramadan Eff. had had leave to go to Deir el-Zor, and returned via Aleppo, Damascus, etc., about six weeks ago. The railway was not particularly guarded north of Kayak, and bridges have only small gendarmerie guards. There is a division at Alexandretta, but no big force at Aleppo, except troops passing through. There is a division in the Lebanon, under Kafaat Bey, who had a division at the Canal attack, Febiuary 191.5 ? Practically no troops are at Damascus, hut one regiment is at Derail, watching the Druses. They have no camels or horsesOn May 13 and 14, Sherif Sharraf, with whom was Lieutenant H. S. Hornby, made two raids near Muadhdham. In at Deraa, except for the gendarmerie. Between Deraa and Maan are no troops except the Railway- battalion, and it should as easy to cut the line there as near Medain Salih, since the Beni Sakhr are very strong and anti-Turk. At Maan were two alai when he passed through, but these had been sent to Gaza a month ago, and he believed one compairy of cavalry. Two companies infatitry were the only troops left. The hospital at Maan is full; all Medina sick are sent there ; and large numbers have gone from Fakhri’s army. At Tebuk were 300 men with mules ; these were moved to Medain Saleh, then back to Tebuk, then again to Medain where he believes are their present headquarters. Tebuk had, otherwise, practically no troops. Kamel Eff. (from Tarablus el-Gharb), was C.O. a very dark man and pro-Turk. Another lot of about 300 mules has lately come under Selim Bey. There are a good many troops at Medain and el-Ula, but he had no details. Jemal Pasha was G.O.C. He is from Ismid, and not to be mixed up with the two original Jemals of Syrian fame. Mohammed Bey, his staff officer, is Arab and pro-Sherif. The Agevl, or Camel Corps, from Wejh still continues at el-Ula under Yuzb. Bakri Bey with about 150 hagins ; but other three deserters lately arrived from el-Ula on their camels say they left the other half of the force, consisting now of 300, at el-Ula. Miralai Salaheddin Bey is staff officer to Fakhri Pasha, but very unfriendly to the latter. 3. General. People in Medina, perhaps 20,000, have no food, or very little. Every railway station receives a month’s rations monthly, but no bigger reserve. He believes there are 10,000 or more deserters in Jebel Druse and large numbers at Nablus ; his conversation on the prospects of successful action north of Maan were most encouraging, including his belief that the Turks would not be able to 'enter the Beni Sakhr country easily, if the latter rose. The Turks are not hard up for food, he thinks, owing to the new exemption law by which payments are made in kind. As regards the situation along the northern sections of the railway, we are informed, under date Ma^ 2o, that the Beni Atiyah’have occupied Ram (or Imram), an important point about fifty miles east of Akaba, and that the Amran section of the Huweitat, under Ibri Jazi, is prepared to co-operate with them in attacking posts along the Akaba-Maan road. The Beni Atiyah are said 'to have made a raid of their own on the troops (labour corps ?) in the Wadi Ethil, south of Tebuk, and to have captured a Yuzbashi and t^n men.rlpfll o£ explosive was wasted, but some forty- the first a great de [ i eiiem y reliefs, which arrived eight rails were destroyed ami d'e e } ’ her a loss of from Mnailhdham and ^ die ^ ^ north T^al.nmn^'thirty-thde rails and the telegraph lines tvere of Mua Indnam, ) Hnrnhv’s report ou these operations destroyed.

Yemen. The Sew Movement. We have already called attention to the growing anti-Turk movement in Yemen {see esp. p. 24a and references quoted there) Since it appears to be unusually widespread, to be rooted in national sentiment, and to have a definite programme and serious plans for putting it into execution it will be timely in r*irr»n late more information about its chief leaders and their aims. The leaders have put forward a member of the Qasim house of Sanaa, in the direct Kassite line, to be proclaimed Imam of Sanaa in place of Yahya. To the latter they threaten no physical violence; but his throne and property are to be co n ti sen ted, and the Shehara branch of the Qasim house is to be superseded, because of the unpatriotic attitude maintained since 1911 by Yahya “ ibn el-Mansur,” the reigning Imam. Such is the profession of the leaders, and we may take it to be sincere, despite indications that a more intimate motive has been supplied by the stinginess and remissness of Yahya in dealing out to the feudatory chiefs their stipulated money allowances. The proposed candidate, Seyyid Mohammed el-Qasim, seems to be himself of no fame, but to be the son of a better known scion of the Qasim house, one Yahya, who has been hitherto in receipt of a Turkish pension. The son has been described to us as a nephew of the reigning Imam. If so, he must be a son of a sister of the latter ; since two brothers would not have the same name. But it is more likely that some distant cousinship is the real relation (this is actually stated to be so by the headman of Seyyid Mohammed’s deputation to Aden). The genealogy reported to us continues “ ibn el-Hadi ibn el- M navy ad billah ibu el-Qasim.” El-Hadi has been a personal title borne by several Imams, and most lately by the Imam Mohammed in the early forties of last century. It is possible (though the interval is rather long) that the present candidate isthe latter’s grandson (Moslems, it must be remembered, often beget sons m old_ age : the present King of Hejaz is grandson of the Emir put m by Mohammed Ali in 1827). The rest of the genealogy does not fit the immediate ascendants of the Imam Mohammed el-Hadi ; but it looks very much as if several generations had been skipped and the el-Muayyad intended is the imam of that name who was son of the Imam Qasim, the first of the Saadah rulers who established himself in Sanaa, and became prince of all Yemen, in the seventeenth century, after the withdiawal of the original lurkish conquerors. This genealogy gives a verj distinctly nationalist and anti-Turk colour to the movement, basing, as it does, the Seyyid’s claim on I mams who all ruled before 1849, when the first Lmamic submission to the Turks was made. Seyyid Mohammed, styling himself President of the Ulema and the Sherifial League of Yemen, has written under date, April 27, to the Resident, Aden, reminding him of negotiations proposed on his own behalf eight months ago by Nakib Yahya esh-Shaif through Raid Ahmed of Hajariyah (one of the border chieftains now in active revolt against the Turks on the Yemen border). Seyyid Mohammed says he has all the Yemen ulema and sherifs in his hand, and that all the Bekil chiefs from Barat up to Nejran have agreed with him. He now sends to the Resident, two akils of the Has hid, Ali Mohsin el-Useimi and Ali Mohsin el-Kharmi. His reference to our King is interesting :— “ We are aware of the power which the representative of the Christ—may the blessing of God be unto him—possesses on land and sea.” He appended a complimentary letter to be forwarded to His Majesty himself. The exordium is truly remarkable :— “ To the benevolent King, the Magnificent Monarch, the great Sovereign, the honourable Emperor of the Christian nations, the kindest King over the followers of Jesus, He who was submerged in the baptismal water, He who drags the tails of respectfulness, and veneration (with him), He whose veneration is dreaded by the inhabitants of the land and sea, He whose administration is longed for by cities and kingdoms, the brave lion, the magnanimous lion, the King of the English, the pure gold.” The other reported leaders of the Movement fall into three categories. I .—Chiefs of the bid pendent Hinterland. These include the ruling Sherifs of Behan and Mareb, who have both written letters, the one to the Resident, Aden, the other to Colonel Jacob. Sherif Ahmed Mohsin of Behan (the last tract of fertility down the Wadi Behan before it enters the south-west corner of the Great Desert) is a well known, if remote, friend of ours, an old and crafty man, who signed theft . • ions like the Sherif of Mareb (some eighty Aden 1 act m t” ' , habitua i] y takes our side from fear of the miles *? th f. n ^ ce Between these two shenfs, and hostile nearer 1 &gt; irkl “' 'I , ' ,. u J er does not appear in this movement, to both, hes Hanh, whose , ^ much of EuropeanS) and the Neither Behan n bMan capita ] al ,d site of the great dam of latter, the ancie ' ; s on e of the landmarks of ancient Qneen ^ by Arnaud) H alevy, and Arabian hist , • Xarkisli escort in 1889).

The Mareb Shenf, dating on \larch 24 also mentions the Nakih as his counsellor. He is less cordial in tone than the Behan Sherif, and takes occasion to say Tat the ruling Imam Yahya is his relation and friend He evidently thinks we are in treaty with the latter ; but though chiding us for our secretiveness, he promises to do our bidding, if we will tell him what we desire. U—Chiefs of Central Highland Tribes. Some seven chiefs have written five of them signing one letter. The most important, the Makib lahya esh-bhait, who has been in correspondence with Idrisi, and professes to speak for all the Bekil, wrote separately from Mareb to Colonel Jacob, under date March 29, saying he had sent his son to Laiz to get money and, evidently, also to confer with the Hajariyah rebels under Raid Ahmed (son of Ahmed Naaman ?). He offers to d-o, if desired by us, to Hadhramaut. Lhe other chiefs merely introduce themselves through the HashidiaMs sent to Aden, and mention other great chiefs of Hashid, Bekil, Hamdan, Bilad Sharifiyin, Ahnum, and Bilad Dhuleima as being in agreement with themselves, and especially Nasir Mabkhut el-Alnnar or t e Himran Hashid, Hizam es-Saar of the Amran Bekil, and Ah Miqdad of the Aids. All these are well known to us. I he last, now about fifty, fought with the Imam in 1911, and took prisoner the Kaimmmakain of Doran. Since last summei, however, he has been at odds with his suzerain. He is \er) powerful in the southern Highlands. HI .—Notables of Central and Southern Yemen. Of these the most important are Sherif Abdullah ed- Dumein. one of the best of the ruling Imam’s lieutenants, who came the Emir of Mecca’s messages to Yemen, and was in Ac enbefore the war ; and Kaid Ahmed of Hajariyah, alread) t mentioned as having been in the field against the Turks for some time. Is he the son of Ahmed Naaman who, before the latter’s death in 1915, was A.D.C. to Ali Said Be}^ (now Pasha) when the latter was at Taiz ? The general plan of these leaders is to deal with the Turkish occupying forces, first in the Aden Protectorate, secondly in Yemen itself, if we will give them material assistance (they ask for no other). Presumably they will proclaim their new Imam Mohammed at the outset, but it is not quite clear whether a locus poenitentiae will or will not be allowed to the present Imam Yahya. If all is true, that the Naqib Yahya esh-Shaif (who seems to be the soul of the movement) and the others assert the forces behind this movement are very considerable. They include, first, the bulk of the fighting tribes of the East Yemen Hinterland, which the Turks have never been able to subdue ; second, the largest tribal units of the Central Highlands, which have always supplied the backbone of the most successful risings ; third, southern border elements already in active revolt. With the Turks short of both money and munitions and unable to reinforce their garrisons, not only ought the first successes of 1904 and 1911 to be repeated, but the setbacks which followed these should not occur again. D. G. H. ABYSSINIA. Summary of Intelligence. Hews from Abyssinia shows that iq3 to the last week in April the general situation was continuing to improve. The revolt in Negus Waldo Giorgis’ northern provinces seemed to have collapsed and Has Seyyum, of Tigre, who was reported, in our Ho. 50, to be on his way to meet lias Taffari, had reached Dessie. This destroys ^ any possibility of a combination between the northern pro^ inces and Eij T asu, and does away with the danger of a rising in Tigre against the Central Government. The internal position in Tigre itself is complicated by the fact that Has Seyyum is supported by only half the population, his personal enemies, Dejaz Guksa and Dejaz Tabri Selassi, exercising considerable influence over the rest. The result is that the province is in a state of perpetual unrest, which can onlv be ended by the nomination of a chief who would be acceptable to the whole of the country. Such a man is only to be found in the person of Dejaz Guksa, who, like Has Seyyum, is a grandson of the Emperor John and, as such, lias stiong hereditary claims on Tigre. His popularity there however, is, the reason for Has Taffari’s hesitation to appoint him lest a united Tigre might prove too independent of control. I he final— 258 — i will be delaved until the result decision a b°^ ? ^ actainst Lij Yasu is determined.

He realizes that it is not in an attack on an almost impregnab e position that Abyssinian troops are at their bes . Brave to recklessness when they can lace their enemy and attack with he sword it is doubtful if they have the cold courage or the discipline necessary to enable them to scale successfully narrow mountain paths in the face of an avalanche of rocks and long ranee fire The Fitaurari is hoping that Lij Tasu s troops will desert him (as Fitaurari Woubie has already done) on hearing of the approach of a strong force, or that Lrj Yasu himself will show his habitual cowardice and try to escape alone. Lither of these solutions is quite possible now that lias Seyyum has come in and all support from him is out of the question 1 here is indeed a rumour that Lij ^ asu has already tied, but nobody t f f / &gt; Ras Hailu of Gojjam is being detained in Adis Abeba until the fate of Lij Yasu is settled—not that there is any special reason to doubt his good faith, but merely as a precautionary measure in accord with the policy of suspicion which every Abyssinian ruler seems bound to follow. From the British point of view, owing to its possible effect on our Somali frontier, perhaps the most disquieting element in Abyssinian politics at present is the unrest reigning in the Ogaden country. One Dejaz Kedani, formerly outlawed by Lij Yasu, but subsequently restored to favour on account, probably, of his Moslem sympathies, was arrested after the Revolution, but allowed to escape. He lied to the Ogaden country and placed himself at the head of a band of some two or three thousand discontented Abyssinians. His presence at Dagabur is a menace to the peace of Harrar and an expedition against him is believed to be a necessity ; but any force which is sent must count on his being supported by the Ogaden Somalis, who would certainly riKP tn r&gt;rntprU. flipmsplvpw A.trn.inst the 1 ootiuc of the Abvssinian the Abyssinians after the revolution and have only recently been persuaded to settle down. The approach of an expedition would certainly frighten them into deserting their villages, and if looting took place, they would rise and join the Ogaden in resisting the Government.

If the expedition advances by another route, or if looting could be restrained and safety guaranteed to the Darods, the trouble might be localized ; but no chief has sufficient influence to prevent his troops from looting even a friendly country through which they may be passing. Recently, Dejaz Balcha, one of the strongest of the chiefs, had to abandon an expedition he had been ordered to make, because his troops refused to go into country which did not offer sufficient opportunities for loot. The authority of the feudal chiefs is fast decaying and the old system of military service by feudal tenure is obviously worn out. The soldiers are beginning to recognize their own power, and, unless the relaxation of discipline is checked, they will some day render the administration of any government impossible. A breath of the wind now blowing over our European civilization seems to have reached Abyssinia. Nobody will do what he is told. An officer recently returned from Abyssinia informs us that:—“ Even those who are condemned to be hanged refuse to obey the sentence. Twenty-seven men were recently so condemned for the murder of a big chief in Adis Abeba, and were led to the usual tree in the market-place. Here they protested indignantly against the proposed hanging, and walked off amid the cheers of the executioners and the crowd.” NOTES. its posii outlawed bl- iceount, ie iy# juntrj aodflf or three^ ffaburis^ osttiimi^ ioustco®A 30 WO rerelf la-res, } e n iu re^ 1- ;' Ajeimi Saadun. As was indicated in our last issue (p. 231), the attitude of this important (though not for the moment very powerful) Muntafiq chief has been undergoing a change since his lettei to Ibn Saud, quoted in our No. 44, p. 119. Nearly two months ago he seems to have drawn closer to Fahad ibn Hadhdhal and finally to have thrown in his lot, for the present, with the Arnarat chief, with whom, according to LEY. “D’ Intelligence of April 4, he went off from Samawah.

One of the greatest difficulties encountered in dealing with the Arab movement has been the lack of cohesion among the Arabs themselves, divided as they are by jealousies and tribal feuds ; whilst the different temperaments of the elements comprising the Arab peoples militate against a wholehearted and cohesive effort on their part against the Turks. Lengthy, yet essential negotiations between the Sherif’s sons and some of even the smaller chiefs have meant long delays in military operations ; local animosities and grievances have to be settled before those affected by them will participate. The Syrian, from the height of his education and “ refinement ” looks down on the Beduin in his “ dirt and sand ” as being beyond real con sideration, while the Beduin in his turn despises the effeminacy of the Syrian. There are several other causes, like the above of a political nature, which tend to make the Arab movement somewhat spasmodic and inharmonious, while on the military side we have experienced obstacles quite as great. I he Bedouin forces have been proved incapable of either attacking, or withstanding an attack from, disciplined troops, and the successes they have so far achieved, if we except the capture of Faif, which was completely isolated and starved into submission, have been those of a guerilla nature; and although the military situation has frequently demanded decisive action, this has not been forth coming through lack of the most elementary disciplined behaviour. In a political sense, therefore, they have lacked in the past, and to a great extent lack in the present, a policy clear enough for them all to grasp, and idealistic enough to encourage them to forget their purely local grievances and ambitions, in a military sense, they need the support of troops who will face a disciplined attack in defence, and supply the moral backing in their offensive operations. To assist in overcoming these difficulties and merely as an adjunct to other endeavours in the same direction, it has been proposed to form an Arab Legion. The objects for which it would be formed may be summed up briefly as follows :— (1) Political object: To form and consolidate a national spirit among the various Arab elements at present at variance in ideals and policy, and to create among them m a practical manner the spirit of unity and enthusiasm, and also, by locating its training camp near the headquarters of the Franco-British Political Mission, to enable those of Arab nationality visiting the Mission to see some visible sign of the efforts being made on their behalf. (2) Military object: r l o forma well equipped disciplined body that can be relied on to fight keenly, to stiffen the Sherifian forces in their operations against the durkis troops, to act as a support to irregular operations against theenemy’s lines of communications, or every if sufficiently well trained, to be employed in part in co-operation with the British forces should occasion require. The operations in which the Legion may take pait would only be those in Arab countries, and the enemy they oppose, only the Turks and those fighting with them in these spheres. It would be officered by Arab officers and would fight under the new Sherifian flag. The organization would be that of the British battalion, and its training would be supervised by French and British advisory officers equally represented. No limit has been fixed for the size of the force, but, as recruiting would be prosecuted in a wide area, it is hoped at the least to form a full battalion, while there is a prospect of the material even for a full brigade being obtained. This material would be obtained from volunteers from among the prisoners of war taken in the various fields of operations, and levies from the Yemen recruited in Aden. Enrolment would not be confined to I Mohammedans ; it is hoped by incorporating Christian Arabs in the Legion to make it non-fanatical and so encourage the ideal of Christian and Moslem working together for the common weal, and to assist in carrying this ideal from association in war to the period of peace. In operations in the Hejaz, of course, the Christians would not be employed, but in any other sphere they would bear their part. All preliminary arrangements have been made for the first double company, for which officers and volunteers have actually been obtained. These arrangements include, in addition to the ordinary details of organization, a compilation of the disciplinary rules and regulations, a glossary of Arabic military terms and a purely Arabic drill book based on the British infantry training. The uniform adopted would be that of an Arab battalion of the Egyptian Army. The scheme has been sent forward for final sanction by the War Office, and it will be possible to make an immediate start if and as soon as this is signified. ARABIA. Hejaz. Intelligence. King Husein replied as follows, on dune 1, to the telegram from the High Commissioner, quoted in our last issue :— lo H.E. The King’s Representative in Egypt. 1 he good wishes expressed by Your Excellency for the happiness of the ruler of the Arab Nation move me to redouble my thanks to your person as well as to the government of His— 265 % Majesty, and I pray heartily to the Almighty that we may ere long celebrate in common at our anniversaries a true victory, and that your Excellency may continue to enjoy health and attain all your desires. “(Signed): Husein.” News comes from Wejh that on May 29 a force of 60 Lurks was cutup by Arabs nearel-Matalli Station. Ten were captured ; the rest were killed (including the officer commanding) or wounded and all their rifles were taken. Captain Stent returned to Wejh from Yambo on May 28, after an expedition to see if good communication by motor car could be obtained between Yambo and Bir Darwish or some other place in that neighbourhood, in the event of the transference of the R.F.C. flight to Yambo. If such communication were found possible, hangars and an advanced base would be made, from which daily bombings of the Turkish positions could be under taken. He got as far as Kheif (say 30 to 35 miles) with his motor car, but was there stopped by the rocky state of the road, which he considers quite impossible for cars in its present condition. He said, however, that if the hangars and necessary stores could be transported to Bir Darwish he would nevertheless establish an advanced post there and be able to bomb the enemy s positions. The machines would fly up from Yambo, a distance of 90 miles and the personnel would be relieved every week or so. Colonel Wilson writes that he is not satisfied that, with only camel communication, which would take three days, such a scheme would be reasonably safe. If a machine broke down on the way it might be vei v difficult to take supplies to, and rescue the occupants ; also, ir Darwish is so close to the enemy position at Bir el Mas hi that even with a guard of Egyptian troops there would be nothing o prevent an enterprising attack being made by the Turks on the advanced aerodrome. He adds however that since, owing to the hard nature of the ground at Bir Mashi, the Turks ha c only been able to construct stone sangars without dugouts or head-cover, the effect of bombing, if only tins could be arrange , would probably be enormous and might well lead to the surrender of Fakhri and his forces. In the event o£ the removal o£ the flight to Yambo, with the supply ship “ El-Kahira,” the water problem at Wejh would become difficult. There is only one source o£ ^nk.^ water supply consisting o£ two wells six miles inland, £ om which, as 5 s ! rcssia required and, in order to have a second source ot supply m case the wells ran out, tank storage up to sixty tons Yil up wanted, this to be filled by ships winch would themselves fill up from the Yambo condenser and discharge at Wejh.— 266 — Large numbers of fugitives from Medina have been arriving at Yambo, a hundred families on May of), about as many the following day, and fifty persons on June 1.

Pasha is said to be resolved to hold out, and to have declared that he would destroy the town rather than surrender it. He is also stated to have received reinforcements, munitions and food supplies. Lieut. -Colonel Cadi, who arrived on May at the camp of Sherif Ali. estimates that the Turkish forces include three battalions at Bir el-Mashi and at Jelijla (on the Sultani Road, about eleven miles from Bir Darwish), two at Bir Ali (with two o-uns and two machine guns, and one at Medina). Ah himself has three machine-gun companies, 1,(MM) icgulai and 2,000 irregular infantry, without counting a large number of Bedouins. A report, dated May 25, from Bimhashi Garland, of his continued operations against the iailwa\ is lathei more satisfactory than its predecessors in so far as it shows that, at last, the O.C. of the raiding parties is being given a certain voice in the conduct of affairs. He had been working in the neigh bourhood of Mudharij nnd Toweira, and he joined Sherif Abdullah at Abu Marka on May 22, after laying a few mines and destroying considerable lengths of the line, hut without having been able to ascertain definitely the result of his work. Scouts sent out did not return. Others sent to look for them reported, probably untruly, that they had found them with their throats cut. Others, again, refused to go at all. Such are Bedouins. The trials of an energetic white officer obliged to depend on them are indeed considerable. Once, when Bimhashi Garland was laying a mine, the fuse went off in his hand, whereupon the whole party bolted with but one exception. He reports favourably, however, of Sheikh Mohammed Abu Ghaneim and Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza, who accompanied him. He approached Abu Marka from Faqeir, and found the road good for cars all the way, hut very inhospitable, without water or camel food. He reports that Sherif Abdullah has two parties, one N. of Hadiya, the other S. of Bueir, each of which is supposed to break 16 rails every night. Abdullah believed that these parties had permanently stopped traffic, and was greatly shocked to learn from Bimbashi Garland that at least two trains had passed within a few days. Bimbashi Garland is trying to induce him to arrange for raiding on a more intensive scale, on a system which he describes in detail, pointing out that one long break is preferable to two short ones, which are probably repaired simultaneously. He is also urging Abdullah to make up a demolition party from Ids Syrian soldiers and to put an officer in charge. he results of their raids would no doubt he more satisfactory and their reports of their doings less exaggerated, than those of the Bedouins. ° on &gt;From a letter written a few days later it seems that this scheme is progressing. Bimbashi Garland has begun training a class of Syrian soldiers who will go out as soon as reliefs can be sent by Feisal. He also gave special instructions to one of Abdullah’s regular parties before they went out and saw that they took double the amount of explosives they had hitherto been taking. Nejd. Ibn Sand's Attitude. King Husein stated, under date May 2, that Ibn Sand had said : “ The Turks will not be beaten, and we must consider them.” Accordingly, Husein fully credits reports, which have reached us from time to time, that Ibn Baud has been promoting the passage of Turkish consignments of specie to the Yemen by circuitous routes. Some weeks ago, on receiving such a report about a consignment of forty or fifty thousand pounds (Turkish), Husein sent a message to Feihan ibn Sirmeil, Chief of the Sbei, but the latter failed by two days to intercept the convoy at a certain well. Now there is question of a further consignment, and the king asserts that a still more easterly road has been chosen, to secure safe passage by which Ibn Baud wrote to sheikhs lying along it almost to Muscat. These, according to his information, have lightened the consignment by some six thousand pounds ; but he does not tell us whether the balance is supposed to have arrived yet in Yemen. In consequence of all this news, King Husein is convinced that Jbn Baud contemplates an attack on himself and some pro- Turk treachery towards us. He complains that the arms given by us to Ibn Baud have been distributed to W ahabis (but to whom else should a Wahabite Emir distribute them ?), and he presses us to call on Ibn Baud to recognize his (Husein’s) paramountcy—a request he had made already to Sh Maik Bykes at their recent meeting. If it be true, as Sherifs Abdullah and Zeid have reported very recently to their brother Feisal, that Ibn Rashid has left for Medina or neighbourhood, Ibn Baud has the chance of giving the lie to all these rumours by attacking Hail behind him. Failing that demonstration, we can only estimate their truth by a balance of probabilities ; but it must not be assumed hastily that, even if Ibn Baud does not attack Hail now, these .rumours are well founded. Our information about Ibn Rashid s move ments may not be credited by him, or may be actually false . Ibn Rashid may have left behind him a sufficient force, with Turkish artillery, to maintain the status quo ante, i.e., t e impossibility of attack by Ibn Baud, weak as he is m guns as recognized by the Indian Government and Sir Percy Cox last— 268 — January. It is true that the last named expressed himself on May 13, less inclined to urge caution on Ibn Saud , but lie did not suggest that the latter’s own view had changed or was llkel 'Shice th?Kuweit Durbar, Ibn Saud has contented himself with consolidating his power in Qasim, and if he has taken any further action against Ibn Rashid it has been limited to writing letters to try and detach chiefs, like Ajeimi Saadun ; to inciting tribesmen to close the Hail-Medina roads (we do not know what, if any, responsibility Ibn Saud had for the tribal fighting mentioned on p. 203)' ; and, possibly, to stopping contraband to and from Kuweit in its passage through Qasim. His relations by correspondence witb Iving' Husem luive continued m n tone of civility ; but Ibn Saud has neither so addressed Husein as to imply recognition ot his paramoniitcy, noi has he evei sent his son or any 3 of his followers to co-operate with the Sheridan armies. Since his capture of Urn Faraun’s camels last autumn (he did this only in obedience to a strong representation from Basra), Ibn Saud cannot be said to have taken, to our knowledge, any active measures against the Turks, except in so far as his appearance and utterances at Kuweit constituted such action. In the meantime, King Husein has accused him more than once of amicable relations with the Turks ; e.g., in a letter dated April 9, Husein stated that Ibn Sand’s agent Abbas el-Faliji, who, according to his own report, had left Damascus hurriedly, in October 1916, on hearing of the Ibn Faraun affair, and had refused to carry Jemal’s letters to Ibn Saud, had afterwards returned to Damascus to apologize on the latter’s behalf and had brought to Riadh forgiveness and presents from Jemal. Also Husein has reported negotiations of uncertain issue between Ibn Sand and a party, including a son of Sherif Ali Haidar, which was trying to get through with money to Yemen. Needless | to add that, on several occasions, inspired Syrian and Con- 1 stantinopolitan papers have reported complete agreement and 1 co-operation between the Turks and the Wahabite Emir. There the matter stands. Ibn Sand desires undoubtedly one thing above all others—his own sovereign independence in’ the territories now subject to him, which include Hasa ; and he would like to add Jebel Shammar to these. Just before the war (May, 1914) he was prepared to accept a guarantee of such independence from the Turks, but as in the end he got none sufficiently satisfactory, be turned back to us. He signed a treaty with us in December 1915, and in virtue thereof he has accepted arms and money. But his confidence has undoubtedly been disturbed by our preferential treatment of King Husein, with whose pretensions neither his own political ambition nor his religious sympathies are quite compatible. At the present moment bis mind can hardly fail to have been agitated further by reports of the Russian situation, and of the improved outlook of the Turks on their northern and south-western Asiatic fronts.In view of the above facts it is not altogether improbable that Ibn Sand is a trimming ” to the extent of refraining from all provocation of the Turks that is not forced upon him ; but, seeing how essential Hasa is to him and what is our actual position in Mesopotamia, it is not in the least likely that he will affront us by attacking King Husein. The latter, be it remarked, has an obvious motive in trying to force our hand in respect of Ibn Sand, whose adhesion to himself he knows he will not secure except through insistence on our part ; and while there is no proof of the statements on which Husein bases his conclusion, there are difficulties about some of them. For example, accord ing to other good information, all Ali Haidar’s sons returned to Damascus with their father, and that easterly route, making a detour almost to Muscat, which the last money consignment is represented to be taking, is, for geographical reasons, hardly credible. Since the above was written, Sir Percy Cox has telegraphed? under date June 6, discrediting the report of Ibn Rashid’s departure .from Hail, but stating that without doubt he has been approaching Ibn Sand with peace proposals. With these Ibn Saud reported on May 12 he had temporized, pending the reception of our views, which he invited. He seemed, however, inclined to make peace ; and desert rumour says has done so by now, Ibn Rashid having restored certain horses which he was detaining. Baghdad is waiting further information, Ibn Hadhdhal (who was at Baghdad on the date of telegraphing) having expressed himself incredulous of Ibn Rashid s hona Jidcs m the matter. Of Ibn Sand’s honour Baghdad has no doubt, and if Ibn Rashid were prepared to come over to us, Sir Percy Cox counselled acceptance of him. Finally, on June 11, a messenger from Ibn Saud reached Basrah, carrying to Sir Percy Cox copies of the correspondence between the two Emirs. I he purpoit of these letters, as telegraphed to us, is that Ibn Rashid pioposed peace but refused to accept Ibn Sand’s terms, of which alliance with the British and with the King of the Hejaz was an essentia condition. Ibn Saud now asks for instructions and for material help. His attitude, therefore, is, so far as we know, loyal, and we must credit the report received by Sherif Feisal, that he has declared publicly, in Riadh and Bureidah, that he is a friend of Kino - Husein and will cut the tongue out of anyone heard speaking against the latter. That Ibn Rashid, however, for Ins part, has pushed some force towards Medina is clear trom an information given by King Husein to the effect that his son Zeid, on some date unspecified, engaged a Raslndite party nicludmg some Turks, under Ibn Leilah } on its way from Mustajiddah towards Medina, killed twenty-six, and captured prisoners, a gun, three machine guns, live stock and munitions. Zcu muse three killed. D Gr Hnotes. Money for 1 emen. reference to the question discussed on |,a S e 2(!7 above, it , Aden has reported, under various dates ,S worth im ins { 24 nimou rs of the arrival of consignments of specie from Constantinople at banaa. Kamaran stated on April 22, that £35,000 in notes and no 000 in void had so arrived, and on June 6 A,leu reported ^ ’ . » , . About a month later two I urkish Xm's who are said to'have brought -£800 to Lahei reported that they had been held up en route to Sanaa by tbn Sand Their consignment for Yemen is stated by a fairly reliable agent to be as high as £82,000; but all figures so reported must he distrusted. The notes are said to exchange in Yemen lor half iheir face value If so, it is difficult to see why Constantinople should trouble to send them so far. The vali of Yemen might 11 Pis own nnst-bellum promises-to-pay on the spot. Since the above has been in type, Aden has forwarded, under date June 2, a statement on the subject, based on information fathered from Lahej. From this it appears as if £30,000 was the total sum in cash confided to three parties of six Turkish emissaries in all for transport to Yemen ; and if (as seems certain), Eshref’s party was one of these, £20,000 odd ol that total never reached its destination. As for the balance, to which has to be added £30,000 in notes, it is not clear what proportion (if any) was brought to Sanaa by the two Turkish officers mentioned above. They secured their release from Ibn Sand s hands by appealing to his sense of hospitality and Moslem solidarity ; but whether all or a part of their cash was also released is not said. Of the third party and what sum it carried, Lahej has no news. But it passes on a rumour of a very large consignment expected through an Oman port from Germany, which may explain the statement made by King Husein that Ibn Sand had issued orders in regard to roads in the East of Arabia. (See above page 267). The “ clean-fighting TurkT Admirers of the clean-fighting Turk may profitably reflect on the following examples of his military chivalry, reported by deserters in the Hejaz Suleiman ihn Fadalla, of Broussa, states that about five months ago, at Medinet el-Haazal, a Turkish captain, Mahmud Effendi, when on reconnaissance, came upon a flock of sheep guarded by two Bedouins and a girl of ten or twelve years of age. One Bedouin fled, but the other was killed and his head was brought into camp. The girl was also brought in and shot, her head being then cut off and exposed in the middle of the camp.Mohammed Ali ibn Salih, of Aintab, states that all the Bedouin prisoners taken in the fight at Bir Ali, whether wounded or not, were killed. The next day, a Turkish patrol found a boy of thirteen or fourteen hiding inside the belly of a dead camel. They pulled him out and beheaded him. There were also three Bedouins in a tent ; during the night they were bayonetted and left in a dying state, but as they lingered for three days they were eventually beheaded. In April, at Bir el-Mashi, eight Bedouin men and two women leaving Medina were captured and, by order of Ali Sahib, were bound and exposed to the sun all day. In the evening they were taken outside the camp, bayonetted, and beheaded. One soldier, who protested, was himself threatened with death. Evacuation of Akaba. It is reported from Wejh, under date June 1, from information received by Sherif Feisal, that there has been fighting at Akaba between Turks and Arabs, resulting in the evacuation of the place by the Turks, who retired to Maan. The road is stated to be clear from Akaba to Maan, except a post of twenty men at Gueira and a post at Fuweila ; though in a confirmatory report from Tor of the same date it is said that there were ten men still at Jerf el-Edeida (? near Jebel Edoid, N.N.W. of Akaba) who were only waiting for camels to remove their kit. Many Turks were reported killed and six Arabs. One camel company of 100 men deserted from the Turks, joined the Arabs and fought the Turks when pursued by them. Syrian Notes. The following extract from the “ Iqbal ” of Beirut, of 20 Regeb last, is of some interest as indicating the dearth of woven fabrics in Syria :— “ One and a half million sacks of sand are required for the fortress of Gaza. They are wanted for the construction of defences against the infinite number of projectiles shot at our .soldiers by the enemy. These are continually being supplied them by their trains and fleet. The sacks are to be used in filling up the breaches made by enemy fire. If necessary, all the silk curtains and screens in all the houses in Palestine and Syria will be used for the purpose, and the sacks made from these will be placed before the defence lines of Gaza on which the future of Syria and the Hejaz so largely depends. “ One quarter of a million of these sacks are to be supplied by the Vilayet of Adana, another quarter by the Mutessarrifate of Jerusalem. Half a million are to be supplied by each of the Vilayets of Aleppo, Beirut and Syria.“ We understand that thus’” lOolww'to Brirut of Ve Mutessarrifates of Tripoli, Latakia, Acre and Nabhis.

Intelligence. Major Joyce sends the following report on his visit to Bir Derwish^— “ Sherif Ali has divided his force into two sections ; himself and his Bedouins, who he states are 10,000 (but I estimate them at about 5,000) occupy the hills and open ground south-west of the big well at Bir Derwish. His Meccan levies hold the hills just above his camp and have regular outposts 'stationed on the tops. The Bedouins also hold hills to the north-east of the Wadi .Freish in the direction of the Turkish positions at Jelajila, about eight miles to the north-east on the Sultani road. It is possible, therefore, that the numbers of Bedouins are greater than I estimate, owing to their wide distribution. “ The trained army and artillery are camped about one-and- a-halt miles north-west of Bir Derwish. They hold a regular line of outposts, with guns and maxims in position. They have their own ration and ammunition dump, and apparently Sherif Ali gives them a free hand as regards interior economy, merely telling off 1,200 camels to bring their requirements from Yambo* The result is satisfactory and there appear to be discipline and system in their arrangements. 1 heir animals look tit and well cared for, and they have lost only four Australian horses in the four months’ operations from Rabegh. “Jauder Kffendi commands in the absence of Yuri Bey and informs me their numbers are 1,800, of which-1,500 might be considered effective. 1 spent a whole morning at then camp and took a note of their immediate requirements, which appear very reasonable considering the length of time they have been in the field. . “ Their artillerv and machine guns are all m good order, and there is apparently a marked improvement in theii handling of the artillery, and they are satisfied with the effectiveness of their guns. “ The taking of Medina is undoubtedly Sherif Ali s one aim and objective, and he practically admitted that when this was achieved his part in active operations would come to an end. 1 suggested that his Bedouins had not been as active as might be expected, thinking possibly that, when Medina fell, theii sources of pay and supplies might either cease or be gieatly reduced. Sherif Ali assured me that this was not so, but^ on the contrary they were more loyal and united than at any time since the Revolt broke out. This 1 believe is so and their general attitude and discipline appeared far better than when was in touch with them at Rabegh. Towards myself, certainly they were much more friendly and less suspicious._ 276 — ^ CRa. Mii-* 1 machine and mountain guns. His presence is essential to - p ee p together the Bedouin tribes ; but unless a competent commander takes over charge of the operations, it appears to me very doubtful if any important military success will be obtained. Colonel Cadi is at present with Sherif Ali in the capacity of adviser and this may bring about some better results. “I questioned Sherif Ali closely re his Syrian officers aijd troops and he expressed himself entirely satisfied with them in every way, with the exception of two of them who had been sent to Mecca as their conduct had not been entirely satisfactory. Though he would never acknowledge it, I do not consider Sherif Ali really possesses a very strong hold over these Syrian officers, and the part they take in operations is arranged more by themselves than by Sherif Ali. Their inactivity since the action at Bir el-Mashi is most probably due to their own lack of enterprise and the fact that Sherif Ali has not sufficient control to supplement it. “ Sherif Ali and the other Ashraf I met were most cordial in their relations with me while 1 was in his camp. No British officer had previously been in as far as Bir Derwish and a few months ago it would have been absolutely forbidden. The Sheikhs I travelled with were most open and friendly and treated me more as an ally than as a unit to be conveyed by the , Sherif’s order, ft seems possible that in time British officers might be allowed to co-operate in an executive capacity in this area, but the old prejudices are slow in changing.” The following notes were collected from refugees on the road between Yam bo and Bir Derwish by Major Joyce and sent to Cairo on June 11 :— “ The Turks have now ordered the deportation of practically the whole civilian population of Medina. Formerly the ideawas for these to be sent north to Syria, but as rations became scarce and the railway interrupted, orders were issued for civilians to leave in any direction. The upper classes and rich merchants left some months ago for the north. The majority of the poorer classes take refuge in the camps of Sherif Ali and Sherif Zeid, but a fairly large number have gone to Hail. Out of a population of about 25,000, only 3,000 or 4,000 are now reported to be remaining in Medina, and many of these are merely waiting transport to take themselves and their families away. About 2,000 of these refugees were actually in Sherif Ali’s camp when I visited Bir Derwish and I passed many caravans on the road. Native carts and porters bring the refugees and their baggage (of which there is a considerable amount) to about two miles outside the city, where it is dumped and the unfortunate people are left to arrange with the Bedouins as best they can to procure camels to take them on. These arrangements are usually made at night, and apparently the Turks do not interfere, or endeavour to seize the camels brought by the Bedouins. The refugees are allowed to take away only a very small quantity of foodstuffs and naturally _ suffer many hardships, though I saw no case of actual emaciation or want. The feeling of these refugees against the Turks is very bitter and numerous imprecations are showered on their heads and on Fakhri Pasha especially. All houses and property had to be abandoned, and in many cases the former were broken into and all available wood, etc., was stolen. “ All foodstuffs are now under direct control of the military and there are reported to be large stocks of barley, rice, burghul, semin and lentils actually in the city. In spite of this, only half-rations are issued to the troops and issues of camel meat are irregular. Civilians are allowed no meat. An extensioiq o the railway has been made and it now runs from the old station through the city up to the citadel near the Bab el-Sham. hlo compensation was given for buildings knocked down to clear the way for this extension. The three main storehouses in Medina aie one at the old railway station, one in the Haram enclosure, and one at the citadel. A pump has been erected m the well m the courtyard of the Haram and the buildings themselves have been fortified with sand-bags and protected with machine guns. “ Very few soldiers are reported in Medina itself, but a coffee-seller reports very strong entrenchments on Jebel Ohod, Jebel Arsi and at Jemma ; he states the majority of the soldiers are outside Medina itself. , “ The Egyptian Tekia buildings have been turned into officers quarters, about forty to fifty officers occupy it. I he clerk himself was invited to go to Syria, but preferred to return to Egypt to collect his arrears of pay. “ Fakhri Pasha evidently rules Medina with much severity and it is chiefly due to him that the discontented army is kept together. There are very few Arab officers or soldiers left m— 278 - Medina, most having been sent to Syria or having deserted to the Sherif. G0L ‘the Arabs « \i', in The (iulf of Akal'.a, an,I b,-ought to Dhaba about a month avo The mines are now to be seen at Dhaba and it is stated that the Turks brought them to Magana about three months ago, but did not utilize them. About June 4, some thirty Ageyl reached W ejh, r,« Dhaba, from Akaba, having deserted from the Turks. They say- that another sixty Ageyl are still with the urks, ready to desert.

Motor Car Runs. (a) Wejh to Jeyadah. The following' Route Report has been supplied by ( apt. f. W. Stent, R.F.C. :— “ June 4, 1917. One K.F.C. ear,one armoured car (strip])ed) and one Ford car left Wejh at 8.30 p.m. We followed the Khauthla route for about twelve miles, when we branched off to the east and ran over foothills in an easterly direction on very well marked camel tracks, till we got to Wadi Maara at 5.40 p.m. From here we went north-east to Abu Ajaj, which we reached at 0.40 p.m. and camped for the night. There were several wells here, of which only two were good, and all the going up to this point was very easy for cars. “ June 6‘, 1917. We left our camp at 4.45 a.m. and ran in a fairly straight line to a point about six miles north of Khauthla in a wadi of that name winch runs north and south just here between the two Jebels Khashub. We turned into it and ran north to Khorba (with a stop of an hour and a half), whiclr we reached at 10 a.m. The going was beginning to be rather had here, and as the Rolls-Royce was rather short of spare tyres we decided to leave it and the Ford and go on with the R.F.C. tender. The water at Khorba was very good and there was plenty of it. We started again at 10.35 a.m. and ran slightly west of north for about seven miles, skirting Jebel Shaihub on our right till we got to the end of it, when we turned sharply to the right into Wadi Kharrar, again skirting 3. Shaihub and running east-south east for about ten miles ; all of which was very rough and stony. Here the wadi turns north-east (el-Kharra) and runs up to a narrow gorge in which there is much running water. W e gothere at 1.45 p.m., but found it impossible to get any further owing to the steps in the rock. “ Total run about ninety miles in ten hours. I inspected the pass and found that there were three steps which could be made passable with very little work, and I think guns could be handdiauled over them as they are. “ I also walked to Jeyadah (about two miles), where 1 found a very suitable place for an aerodrome, which only needs a little clearing. We started back again the same day, and after picking up the armoured car and the Ford, reached Wejh at 1.30 p.m. on June 0, having accomplished the return journey in seven hours.” (b) Yamho to Bir Derwish. Major Joyce sends the following under date June 12 :— “Capt. Stent, R.F.O., and myself arrived at Yambo on May 21, and disembarked with the Crossley tender on which the reconnaissance was to be attempted. No letter was received from Sherif Ali sanctioning the reconnaissance, but approval had been obtained from Mecca, and it was decided, therefore, not to await receipt of the letter from Sherif Ali. “ Sheikh Abdel Qadir at first volunteered to proceed with us and act as guide, but decided later he was too busy, and produced in his place Sheikh And Mirzuk of the Harh tribe, who turned out a satisfactory and reliable guide. The routes were thoroughly discussed before starting ; the two likely ones being one via Bir Said, and the other Y/u Bedr Honein and W adi Safra. It w T as decided to attempt the Bir Said route first, as being the more direct one,and also the Mahmal route (which meant that an enormous amount of traffic passed along it). ( amels were despatched by Sheikh Abdel Qadir to follow the car tracks in the event of a breakdown. “A start was made at 3.15 p.m. on May 22, ami some forty-five miles were covered before halting for the^ night at Kashm Burweith, about four miles west of Bir Said. 1 he load was generally good, except for about half-a-mile of dee]) sand met with on entering the foothills at 1 ageisln The car punctuied once on this stretch of road. On the morning of the 22nd, ve proceeded via Bir Said and W adi W ash up to about one-and-a- half miles from the Difran Pass, when the road ascends to a neck in the hills, and thence leads on to Hamra. Here the road became very rough and large stones made the going difficu t. Capt. Stent and myself made a reconnaissance of the road up to the pass and found it, in its present state, quite impossible tor motor traffic. A narrow path had been cleared by the lurks, but it would probably take a hundred men ten to fifteen days work before the track could be widened sufficiently and the large boulders removed.— 280 — “ Findine this route impracticable, we decided to return to Kir Said amUrom there endeavour to get across the country to edr Honein and into the Wadi Safra Phis was successfu ly accomplished and we entered the Wad, Safra about three miles south west of Bed,-. Some very soft sand was encountered shortly after getting into the wadi and the car stuck several times ; but with this exception we proceeded up the wad, without much difficulty, though the going was very rough and eventually we halted at Wasta for the night On the morning of the 24th, we nroceeded up the wadi to Urn Diyal, a village with palm trees, about one mile west of Kheif. Here the road became very bad, an( j a f ter inspecting it on foot Capt. Stent decided that it was 'impracticable to proceed further, and to attempt it would probably involve the loss of the car (1 calculate titty men could make this bit of road passable in one day.) We accordingly returned to Hamra, in which stretch of about eleven miles we had four punctures, and there awaited the arrival of the camels which had been sent out to follow our tracks. These arrived on the morning of the 24th ; accordingly on the morning of the 25th, Capt. Stent and the Crossley tender, with two guides, returned to Yambo and I proceeded on camels to Bir Derwish. The road east of Kheif for about eight miles would require working on if cars were to use it to any extent ; it would only be just passable in its present state. From Bir Abbas to Bir Derwish the road is excellent. “(1) That cars can be got as far as Um Diyal, and with a small amount of work, could, in my opinion, be got up to Bir Derwish. “(2) That without a considerable amount of work the road could not be used to any extent by motor transport, and the wear and tear on tyres would be very great.” SYRIA. Jebel Nuseiriyah. The following extracts are taken from a valuable report prepared by Fere J. Janssen and communicated by the “ Bureau des Renseignements, Division de Syrie,” in November, 1916. bhe full report contains also a list of administrative districts, statistics of villages, and notes on personalities. A map was also appended :— Population. “ The mountainous region bounded on the south by the Nahr el-Kebir, on the east and north by the Orontes (Nahr el- Asi), and on the west by the Mediterranean, is largely inhabited by Ansariah. Considered geographically, this region forms a kind of island separated from the rest of the country by remarkable natural features. To the south, the depression of the Nahr el-Kebir divides the Jebel Nuseiriyah or Ansariah district from the northern part of the Lebanon which is known as the Jebel Akkar. This division is very definite, the northern most slope of the Jebel Akkar rising to a height of 350-400 metres above the southern bank of the Nahr el-Kebir, whilst ten kilometres to the north of the river, the castle of Kalaat el- Hosn, or Hosn el-Akrad, is on a summit 735 metres high. At this point the narrow and deep pass is commanded by the neighbouring; heights. In the middle ages the castle of el-Hosn dominated the country and commanded the road. I he l urks have now made their preparations for defence at Telel Kalak on the Tripoli-Homs Railway at about 100 kilometres from the former. To the east, the Jebel Nuseiriyah is bounded by the Orontes. Bridges over this river are rare except at the two large towns of Homs and Hama, there being only three or four in a length of 140 kilometres. The one at Jisr es-Shoghur is the best known. The Nahr el-Asi flows from south to north as far as Jisr el-Hadid, another bridge opposite Antioch. Then it abruptly changes direction and flows west through a gorge some 700- 800 metres deep. Here it divides the northern limits of the Jebel Nuseiriyah from the southern slopes of the Amanus range. Nature of Country. “ The country is mountainous and broken. It is only on the coast between Latakiah and Tripoli that there is a narrow strip of fairly flat country. The principle heights from south to north are those of Kalaat el-Hosn, Safita, Kadmus, Aleika, Sahyun, Akrad, Ordu, Akra Shaksini, Koseir : some of these rise to 1,700 metres, e.g. Jebel Akra. Rivers. u Numerous streams flow into the the Mediterranean. The most important is the Nahr el-Kebir, which flows into the sea to the south of Latikiah. Most of these streams, though oi small volume, make communication with the interior difficult, owing to their flowing at the bottom of deep gorges, and owing to there being few roads. “ A name, which is not given on the maps but which is frequently used by the natives, is Jebel Kalbiah. 11ns name is given to the district between the Nahr Banias and the Nahr el-Kebir (Latakiah). It is very mountainous, and contains^ a number of hiding places used as places of refuge by brigands, rebels and deserters. Many of the Ansariah have moved there, and live by requisitions and robbing the Government. Hie latter has not yet succeeded in establishing itself in t ie m enor of the Jebel Kalbiah, the inhabitants of which remain exempt from paying taxes and from military service.2X2 Races and Sects. a Besi ae S the Ausariah, who give their name to the country, rhere are also a number of important races which must he mentioned. n a Ch ri s tians, belonging both to the Greek and the Marouite churches, are found in large numbers about Homs el-Akrad, Satita. and Zimrin, ie .,in the districts nearest to the Lebanon. There are others at Tartus, round Banias and at Latakiah. u Xhere are some Armenian villages, including Kassab on the slopes of Jebel Akrad. Mohammedans are numerous in the villages and particularly the larger villages along the coast, especially at Latakiah. ' Kurds occupy the Jebel Akrad, whence its name Ismailians occupy some twenty vdlages round Kadmus, Masyad, and Hamidieh. They belong to a Shia sect, takinu- their 'name from one Ismail, father of Mohammed, the seveiith Mahdi after Ali. In S7J a.p., the divinity which existed in Ali. was recognized to have been transferred to Mohammed Ben Ismail. He was proclaimed Mahdi by Abdullah Jh n Meimun el Kaddah, find his followers were called Ismailians. The population of the Jehel Ausariah is therefore very mixed ; Arabs, Mohammedans, Ismailians, .Kurds, Armenians, Maronites, Greeks, are all intermingled with the Ansariah. The latter are, however, much the most numerous and most influential. Numbers and Statistics. “ No reliable statistics have ever been drawn up. Several authors and travellers have estimated the number of Ansariah at from 110,000 to 150,000. The American missionary Van Dyck, in his Arabic geography, estimates that there are 112,500 Ansariah, distributed as follows : In the Akkar district south of the Nahr el-Kebir, 3,500 ; Safita district, 25,*100 ; Sanjak of Latakiah, 75,000; in the mountains east of the Orontes, 3,750 ; Ruad, 5,000. Van Dyck does not mention the Ansariah of Antioch, or those of Sueidia and El-Aidiyeh, six kilometres north of Antioch. Nor does he include those of the Jebel Ala, Mersina, Adana, or Tarsus. In upper Galilee, north of Lake Tiberias, there are also three Ansarieh villages, Ain Fit, Zaura and El Gaduar. A fair estimate of the numbers of the Ansariah could perhaps be between 125,000 and 150,000, of whom 110,000 to 120,000 are actually in the Jehel Ansariah. (tccupations. u In general, the Ansariah are fellahs or peasants, who live in a fertile country and practice agriculture. Besides cereals, wheat, barley, millet, etc., they cultivate the olive and the vine. A recent but very well developed industrv is tobacco, that of Latakiah being very well known ; it is cultivated in the hills near Latakiah by the Ansariah.Origin and History. “ According to some savants, the Ansariah are sectarians of a certain Mohammed ibn Noseir, a follower of the eleventh Shiite 1 main, who m the eleventh century founded the religion ol the Arabs. Tt is from him that they are supposed to have taken their name. Arab historians have adopted this legend, but place Ibn kloseir in the seventh century. Dussaud puts forward the claim that the Ansariah are the descendents of the “Mazerini” of Pliny (“Hist. Nat.,” 5, 81), and this is supported by the similarity of name and locality. In spite of the Arab invasion of the seventh century, the Ansariah were not won over to Islam, but remained pagans. There is no mention of them from the seventh to the eleventh centuries. They are next mentioned in the chronicles of the Crusaders. In 1099, after taking Antioch, the Franks captured Maraa en- Namaan ; they then moved to the Lebanon, where they killed a large number of people called Noseiris, and subsequently beseiged Arkah in the district of Tripoli (Bar Hebraeus, “ Chr. Syrie,” 281). The Crusaders gradually occupied all the strong holds of the country : Kalaat el-Hosn, Safita, Oriameh, Markab, Aleika and Manokah in Markab, Sahyun, Ivosseir, Shoghur, Bakas, Bokebeis (Abu Kabeis), Barin, etc., but after the battle of Hattin (1187) Saladin conquered the Ansariah country, and the inhabitants became subject to the Sidtan of Egypt. “ Early in the twelfth century the Ismailians who were at Salamyah, near Hama, took refuge in the Ansariah country. In 1132 they captured Kadmos, Kahf, and some years later, Masyad, Rosafa, Kadir, etc., and became celebrated by the name of Assassins. Historians have given their chiefs the name of the Old Alan of the Mountain, the Ansariah had to submit to this invasion and several adopted the doctrines of the Ismailians, especially in the time of their best known chief, Rashid ed-Din Sinan. In the year a.h. 717, under the Mahdi, Afohammed ibn Hassan, the Ansariah took by surprise the Mohammedan town of Jebele and killed most of the inhabitants. The governors of Latakiah and Tripoli prepared to suppress them, but the Sultan ordered them to be left alone as they cultivated the land for the Mohammedans. The Ansariah detested Christians just as much as Mohammedans. Burchard de Alont Sion described them as a cruel, malicious race, and hostile to Christians. Bibars, 1260— 1277, destroyed the power of the Ismailians and tried to convert the Ansariah to Islam, but unsuccessfully. They were neither converted nor assimilated, and gradually letuined to their independent way of life. About this period the Raslan was the most important tribe of the Ansariah. They surprised and captured the stronghold of Alasyad occupied by the Ismailians and killed most of the inhabitants. The Pasha ol Damascus sent an army which burned a.few villages and was recalled without having penetrated far into the mountains. ’“ In 1854 a minor local chief, Ismail Bey of the Metawara- 284 — sj ara-'teirt! k— 11 . ,t .sa m w „£, r*. , 1 * 1 «. ««bii.h«i assumed the t a y e a t the same time to keep on ^termswhh the Ottoman Government, which, in return for r '“ 1 rsJ STirti ‘nxd t StS th' wl,',i b district ...d th. mcst ImgM Mo W tenoi oi i 0 ver Kalbiah, Hosn, and even the northern district, about 120,000 people acknowledging his authority His exactions at last caused strong interests to fight against him. He intrigued with the Porte m order to be given the stronghold of Kalaat el-Hosn, where he would be secure against sudden attack. But just as he was about to take possession of it, , the Mohammedans of Hosn and Akkar rose against him Religious questions were raised, and the Government reconsidered their decision and refused Ismail what he had asked for Troops from Damascus and Tripoli invaded the Jebel. Ismail took to fljo-ht and sought the higher mountains, where he was betrayed and killed by one of his relations AH Ohelh. “ After the disappearance of Ismail, the Ottoman govern ment tried to administer the country itself, but it was with great difficulty that the officials collected taxes and raised recruits. Many times it has been necessary to adopt rigorous measures, invade the country and pillage the villages. In 1870 the Russian ao-ent at Latakiah, writing to his Consul-General at Beyrout, said, ‘ The state of the Ansariah districts is most wretched. There is neither justice nor security. The state of the Jebele district is still worse ; the Ansariah villages are wasted by pillage and fire. The tax collectors, the officials and the friends of the Kaimmakam practise every injustice and take from them all means of existence. Side by side with military action against them, attempts were made to convert them, but the mosques which were built remained J^ Ci-t-Y-kz-k /'xT kxT 1X0 Y»C5 Present Situation. u A government of this kind, which has remained the same for the last forty-five years, is not such as can win the sympathy of the Ansariah. Equally strong is the hatred which the latter bear to everything which is Turkish and Mohammedan, there are no families sufficiently powerful to raise the standard of revolt, and their misfortunes have not united the different clans or Ashirets. “ All these races nourish their old antipathies in their hearts. Except for some of the Mohammedans, all wish to be free of the Ottoman yoke. T hey are, however, incapable of uniting for common action, possessing no leaders or generally acknowledged chief, and each havingno confidence in his neighbour. Evennow the Christians do not trust the Mohammedans, and they would not have more trust in the Ansariah. Numerous deserters, as many as 7,000 or 8,000, are said to be in the Kalbiah mountains. This figure isdoubtless exaggerated, and moreover the sentiments of these deseiters are unknown and they should not be trusted, ft must be acknowledged, however, that the circumstances at present are much in favour of Allied intervention in the Jebel Ansariah and in the Lebanon. The suppression of the privileges of the Lebanon has brought discontent to a head, the suppression of ‘ bedel ’ annoys a large number of the middle and influential classes, and the announcement of a levee-en-masse of all able- bodied men to fight for the Germano-Turks exasperates the whole population.” NOTES. Jebel Radhwah. The following is contributed by Bimbashi Garland, who has travelled recently from Abu Markha in Wadi Ais to Kheif Husein in Wadi Yambo :— “ I was told by two Arabs at different times that in Jebel Radhwah there lives a quite distinct tribe. They are said to have gardens, producing everything they require, goats and other animals. They never allow an outsider to ascend their Jebel and have no intercourse whatever with the outside world. They use neither money, nor clothing, and are said to be of a savage disposition. Passing close to the Jebel one was unable to see any of their settlements. “ It rained quite heavily on May 30, for the greater part of the day, and I think this is somewhat late for rain in this country.” The fight between Rashidite mid Sheri fed forces. At the fight mentioned in our last issue (p. 269) it seems doubtful whether Ibn Rashid himself was present, but certainly Rashid Ibn Leilah was there. He escaped. The Sherifian forces were, it is reported, mainly Harb tribesmen drawn from the Feridah and Zakara (Dhikarah). These profess to have lost onlv one man. According to Suleiman el-Dakhil, nephew of Jarullah of that ilk, Ibn Rashid’s former agent at Baghdad (Suleiman left Hail about six weeks ago), Rashid Ibn Leilah is all-powerful with Ibn Rashid, but, owing to scarcity of food and supplies, the townsfolk and tribesmen are turning more and more against him, and only need assurance of our continuance in Mesopotamia to force Ibn Rashid to come to terms with us. The caravans which have got through from Nejef brought much less than was expected or is needed, and very little is coming up from Kuweit.^8(&gt; Operations at ^ of tlie , iava l attack on Salif (on the Fhe nnmedia .1 ^ Island), which took place on North Yenien coasl neat the sa]t . refin ; n g and other plant belong- dune Id, was to n (ml pany.

From news sent by Aden, under date June 1H, it appears that much fighting has taken place and in still going on, m Yemen both south and north. Die Hadaa 4'stnct, up to the borders of Yafa, is still occupied by Mohammed beif-el-Islam and an fmamite force of 1,500 men, which was sent two months ago to operate against Juban, Nawa and Hubiatem. 1 he Mausate sheikhs have had to watch their frontiers to prevent trouble with this force. The Taiz district is thoroughly disturbed chiefly through the combined action of Ahmed Pasha with the new claimant to the Imamate, Sey vid Mohammed Taliya.. f lie ' former is reported to have lifted L.T. 2,000 in bullion on its wav to Lahej and to have turned some 2,000 Dim Mohammed and Dim Husein tribesmen loose into the region. 1 he Badan Arabs also are said to be joining Seyyid Mohammed, who has received dues from the greater part of the Hashid and the Bekil as we as lesser tribes like the Hamdan. The Imam Yahya is stated to have warned the 1 urks that they are on the point of losing a Taiz. In the north, Ibn el-Heij is reported by Kamaran to have definitely seceded from the Turks and to be co-operating with Idrisi. The latter’s action against Ibn Thawab and the Abs tribesmen, on May 14, seems to have been a serious afian resulting in unusually heavy casualties. Idrisi is reported to &gt;e steadily gaining the upper hand.SECRET. Arab Hureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, June 28, 1917. No. 55. SUMMARY. ARABIA.— Hejaz. Lith. Intelligence. MESOPOTAMIA.— M nseiyib, Kerbela, Nejef, Hillah. NOTES.— Abyssinia. K. Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.ARABIA. Hejaz. Lith. The following notes have been furnished to the Naval Authorities by Lieutenant G. W. Murray of the Topographical Section G H.Q., who was attached as Political Officer to the Lith Survey.' The prohibition of landing during the latter part o£ t p e Survey’s operations limited Lieutenant Murray’s opportunities of acquiring information, but he has used those he had very well to increase our knowledge of a previously very ill-known district, and very obscure tribes :— “Lith (‘dense grass’) is a poor town of from 1,500 to 2 000 inhabitants, about 80 miles due south of Mecca and 120 from Jiddah by the coast road. The inhabitants reckon it four days journey to both places and the same to Taif. They are a colony of Hadharim (people of Hadramaut) from southern Arabia, not on the best of terms with the Dhawi Hasan Bedouin bv whom they are surrounded. They, in common with the natives of the whole district, have a peculiar habit of sucking the teeth while speaking, and saying ‘ilia’ (maybe) for ‘aiwa’ (yes), which strangers at once remark. The Sheikh of the Hadharim is Sala Harim. The Sherif at the time of our first visit (January 11)17) was Nasir Ibn Hazza, who was replaced later, during his absence in Mecca, by one Sultan. He maintains a local garrison of seventy-two soldiers, among them ten or twelve Ageyl from Nejd, who are paid six pounds monthly and supply their own camels (very good ones). The other soldiers, mostly men from Bishah, serve for their food or very little pay. All are armed with modern English rifles. “The buildings, from the Sherif’s residence downwards, are of the poorest description, being either low mud houses or conical straw huts. The only two-storeyed building serves as the mosque, and there are also five or six shops, one a silversmith’s. The Imam, a pro-Turk, is the only educated man in the town. “The town stands on an island in the Wadi Lith (dry, except after rain) and obtains its water from a large well, about four fathoms deep, in the western branch, which affords an apparently inexhaustible supply. Wadi Lith is the continuation of Wadi Sillama, itself formed by the confluence of Wadis Ghara and Safra from the north and east ; after passing the town, it continues in a southerly direction till it reaches the sea about 300 yards east of the palm-grove at Riadha. “There is a dense grove of palms to the north of the town, and after rain the country to the east is sown with dura, dukhn, and water-melons in a broad belt stretching at least as far south as the Khalig Hasan, which enters the sea at Raka.“ Mersa Ibrahim, so called from the well who lies buried there, is about a mile and a hall to the west of the town, and is now practically deserted. The mosque and minaret mentioned in former sailing directions have fallen down, and since the departure of the Turkish garrison the barracks have been abandoned and the blockhouses destroyed. “ There are no supplies or water at the port itself and everything has to be fetched from the town. “ Dhawi Hasan, a tribe of Sherifial descent, inhabit the coast from just north of Lith to a point near Jelajil. According to Mohammed Hujeir, a relative of the Sheikh of the Beni Mehidi, the sub-sections with their chiefs are as follows :—( # ) Sub- •Sections. Chiefs. Fighting Men 1 El Asaf. Ahmed Abd el Aziz. 90 2 El Khumjan (t). Aid ibn el Hasan. 90 3 El Hasan ibn-Ahmed. Mohammed ibn Ali. 170 4 El Jisas. Khashm ibn Ahmed. 170 5 El Sumdan. Ibrahim ibn Ali. 500 6 Na’ara. Musa ibn Asab. 170 7 Hawadma. Imbarak Slump. 1,050 8 Beni Mehidi. ( Ahmed ibn Gfhazi. ( Ibn Haidar. 1,050 9 Dhawi Ayaf. Mohammed ibn Badish. (f) 170 Total for Dhawi Hasan ... 3,460 “Of these, Beni Mehidi and Sumdan are the most likely to be met along the coast. South of the Dhawi Hasan are an independent offshoot of theirs called the Dhawi Barakat, chief Abd el Aziz ibn Qasi. (§) Their strength is about 650 men, and while the clans quarrel among themselves, the whole of the Dhawi Hasan and Dhawi Barakat would make common cause against the Sherif of Mecca if need be. At the present time, the sentiment of both tribes seems to be in favour of acquiescence in the Sheriffs rule as the weakest form of government obtainable, and so far preferable to domination by the Turks or the Idrisi. They have refused to contribute men to the Sheri f’s forces acting against Medina. * The numbers given in the table are arrived at by taking the mean between the numbers as given by Mohammed Hujeir, and those arrived at from the fact that the Beni Mehidi annually circumcise 35 to 40 youths of 18 years of age. Assuming the life of a Bedouin to be 4o years, this gives 1,200 males of that tribe between 15 and bO years of age. Huieir’s estimate was 25 per cent less. ' t Sheikh Mohammed Hasan Ibn el Ud, mentioned in the Handbook of Asir as Sheikh of the Dhawi Barakat, is an unimportant pirate belonging to the Khumjan. . . t Sheikh Mohammed fbn Badish of the Dhawi Ayat petitioned the King of Hejaz, saying the Survey was building barracks. . § Sheikh Abd el Aziz ibn Qasi of the Dhawi Barakat took an active part in destroying marks.290 - “The total of the two clans thus amounts to perhaps 4,000 . , j. . whom the Dhavvi narakat possess many.

Some of my informant’s relations pirated a craft belonging to Sheikh Arif ibn Arifan of Qadhima, murdered his three companions, wounded him severely and threw him into the sea. He offered a stout resistance, killed one of the aggressors, and finally escaped to the Turkish garrison at Lith, off °which place Ids vessel had been lying. But-as he had committed the sin of killing a Sherif, his blood or that of his family is still sought by Dhawi Hasan, and my informant, Mohammed HujeiroFthe Beni Mehidi, announced his intention of killing him if ever he obtained the opportunity. Mohammed Hujeir gained some local notoriety by killing one of the Dhawi Barakat in the market at Lith some time ago. The above story is corroborated in every detail by Sheikh Mohammed Arif, from whom I just heard it, and who showed me the scars of the wounds received in llie combat. “ The laws of Dhawi Hasan resemble those of other Arab tribes, but the penalties imposed are slighter than those prescribed by custom in Sinai or Moab.” Intelligence. Following on reports published in our jSTos. 53 and 54, pp. 271, 278, information has now come, via Tor, from a reliable Arab who left Akaba on June 11. At that date the place had been reoccupied, he stated, by a mixed force of some fifty Turk and Syrian regulars and some three hundred Arab irregulars. The agent testified further to having seen a number of u foreigners,” occupying twenty-eight tents, and wearing peaked caps. If this news is correct, it may possibly be explained asreferring to a naval detachment. We were informed that one, officered by Germans, was ^ent southwards in April last from (ialilee. According to unconfirmed information received by the French Military Mission at diddah, but of uncertain value, Sherif Zeid has driven in a certain number of enemy outposts of unknown strength near Medina. Except Awali, the garden oasis some two miles east of the city, the names of the places thus reported cleared are not known to us ; but “Khakhe” is said to be two hours distant, probably to east. 1 he others, “Shehat” (or “ Hillah Shehat ”) and “ Sela,” remain unplaced. The report says that the Beni Ali of Awali made common cause with Zeid’s forces, but the Turks were able to get their guns away. It will be remembered that these tribesmen, who are Harb Shiahs, were cruelly treated last August by the Medina &lt;&gt;’arrison on its first sortie after the outbreak of the Revolt. r*) Zeid has reported the arrival of a deputation of sheikhs and sheikhs’ sons who (so far as we can identify their names) brought the adhesion of constituents of the Aslam Shammar and the two chief Anazeh tribes of the northern Hamad., the Sibaa and the Fedaan. As, however, some of the tribal and personal names seem to have suffered in transliteration (and probably also in typing), we await confirmation of news, which, if correct, might have some bearing on future plans. Grazing is unusually scarce in the Hejaz this summer, thanks to drought and locusts, and this scarcity complicates all operations, fodder having to be carried where usually transport animals can live off the country. There is also everywhere a shortage of camels, and to this more than anything else has been due the lon&lt;&gt;' delay of Feisal’s offensive against the el-Ala section of the railway. There is now, however, good prospect of his wetting to work immediately in combination with ^ im brother ^Abdullah, who will operate against Hadiyah ami neigh bourhood. The first fortnight of duly should show us how far tliis offensive is likely to succeed in its immediate and ultimate A further report from Sherif Zeid about the fightJ)etween his forces and the Rashidite party, mentioned on p. 285 above, states that the enemy party was composed mainly of 1 urkisti regulars under Hamid Bey ; the latter escaped, but a 1 his men were either killed or captured. The report puts the enemy figures at 26 killed and 250 prisoners ; and Sherif Feisal says there is no doubt that the Emir Sand I bn Rashid himself was present, but got away. Accompanying the soldiers were certain Qasim and Kuweit merchants (it is alleged), and measures aie beinw taken to ascertain their names, with a view to ieporting them to our Political Officers on the Mesopotamian side. Ihe amount of sheep and other live stock taken seems to have been very large.MESOPOTAMIA. Museiyib, Kerbela,Nejef and Reports bv Captain H. \V. Young on his visit oF inspection, in the early part of April, to the Euphratean country between VIuseivib and Hillah iiave reached us from Baghdad. Most of their contents refer to matters too exclusively Mesopotamian and local to be suitable for our Bulletin ; but m parts they touch on the desert, its political condition, temper, and relation to the Euphratean towns. We make certain notes and extracts. The Museiyib district is in danger of serious loss by the state into which'the Hindieh Barrage has fallen. It seems to have been neglected and ill-used for some time , legulatoi sashes have been broken and only some have been repaired ; machinery has been looted ; the carriage road from Museiyib is hardly passable, and the river has begun to scour pot-holes. 1 he town of Museiyib itself is reported to be in a disturbed state, guarded day and night, loopholed and armed. Stray shots are tired at all hours during the early part of the night. The road to Baghdad, passable for light cars, was, at the time of Captain Young’s visit, none too safe, and the same was true of the Kerbela road. -I-»-» » \/^l l v-o/'v Ir’/'Wi Kerbela town was much damaged in the street fighting, but the Holy Shrines have hardly been touched. The spirit shown to us in the town , was good, the leading ulema proving quite amenable ; but news of our movements and actions north of Baghdad was verv scantv and inaccurate. At that time the Turks were still holding Diwanieh, and, under the circumstances, it is satisfactory that Captain Young should have been so well received. Nejef showed more enthusiasm than Kerbela, but its leading sei/yi'/s were anxious not to commit themselves too deeply. Here, more than at Kerbela, there is difficulty with the desert tribes, and Sheikh [Imran of Hindieh was got hold of and talked to. From the tribes' point of view, the completion of the Sari bund near Fellujah and the completion of the escape above the barrage are pressing questions. Umran was very proud of his arrangements for keeping the routes open, and also of having locked up and taken charge of the Turkish barracks at Hindieh. He evident!v aims at being recognised by us as administrator of his home territory. The town sheikhs and the ulema seemed to be on good terms, and Captain Young thought, that, if these sheikhs, the Killidar and the head of the Municipality could be officially installed as a town council with a president elected under our auspices, the town would govern itself satisfactorily till the end of the war, with occasional inspection by a representative of the British military authorities. ‘•The same applies to Kerbela. Both towns are quite capable of defending themselves against the only enemies whoare at all likely to attack them, namely, the Beni Hassan on the one side and I bn Rashid on the other. All that they require is official recognition of their own institutions and an occasional visit of inspection. I was asked by Seyyid Mehdi to represent that the Shammar will soon be moving down to the neigh bourhood of Nejef and Shenafieh. The townspeople are quite capable of refusing mesabilah to the Shammar, if directed to do so ; but they point out that the blockading of the towns alone will not be enough. I he Ghazalat tribe will always keep the Shammar supplied with rice and dates from their own lands, and nothing short of force will prevent them.” At Hillah, which was Capt. Young’s last stage, “the town-versus-tribes feeling is exceedingly strong. The townsmen do not hesitate to accuse the tribesmen of every kind of law lessness and exaction. The towns on the waterways are almost in a state of siege. Here in Hillah three watchmen are posted on the minaret of the mosque and fire whenever they see a horseman beyond the date groves. This is not the only precaution taken. Both here and at Museiyib the ends of the streets facing the desert are bricked up and loop-holed. There is some reason for the townsmen’s attitude. Extortionate tisiar dues are taken from travellers under co\ er of the pretence .of keeping the roads open. Twenty heliums laden with grain have collected here, the nakhudas being afraid to take them on to Museiyib. A petition has just this moment been brought to me by a traveller who was waylaid and robbed to-day by the Khafaja, his companion having actually been abducted by them. But the townsman makes the most of his legitimate grievances. I have been assured many times that the Beni Hassan intended to sack Nejef and Kerbela. Seyyid Mehdi, the Nawab, Afdhal Khan, Sevyid Hadi, and various others all claim to have been the saviours of the holy shrines. As a matter of fact, the roads in Beni Hassan territory appear to be safer than anywhere else.” Capt. Young had a most enthusiastic' reception at Hillah, but he found the place in a very unsatisfactory state. “ A quarter of the town is in ruins. The narrow streets are choked with debris and refuse. The Turks, the tribes, and the townspeople themselves seem to have vied with each other in indiscriminate looting and destruction. The nine mukhtars, each of whom is trying to make himself into a Sheikh, have taken no steps to restore order. The bridge, which consists of only eight shakhturahs, has not been put together, though the materials are all to hand. Shots are fired at all hours of the day and night, A black slave named Xanga is allowed to terrorise travellers and assault women from a fort not two miles outside the town on the Hindieh road, and all the 1,500 armed men of the town are unable to stop him. For a fortnight or more both the Baghdad and Hindieh roads have been closed to all who prefer not to be robbed en route. The flow of grain from Afej and Daghara has been seriously interfered with.

Captain Young sums up his impressions as follows “ The townsmen, except in Kerbela and Nejef, which have never depended much on Government assistance tor their pro- tection, are eagerly looking forward to the restoration of order. The tribes have had a taste of independence and the longer hey •ire left to enjoy it the more difficult will it be to control them later. At the same time they quite realize that they are incapable of developing the country, even to the extent that they them selves would like to see. As the Arab proverb puts it, their brain is in their eyes.’ Let them hut see that a good Governmen will really benefit them and they will accept the discipline and tribute without which no good Government can exist. bevy id Mohammed Ali Kasvini was very eloquent on the subject ot revenue collection. ‘ Take something,’ he said, ‘if it is only one- tenth of your due.

And the sooner we give, the better. Bridges, telegraph lines, and roads can be restored immediately at trifling cost.

Abyssinia. A report from the Commissioner of British Somaliland states that Kedani (p. 258), the Abyssinian outlaw and emissary of Lij Yasu, is extending his influence in the Ogaden country of which he probably aspires to become Governor. He appears to be preparing the ground in anticipation of Lij Yasu’s return, and may become a serious danger, if he succeeds in establishing any cohesion among the Ogaden, who are in the habit of making raids into our Protectorate. If the situation does not improve, it may become necessary for the British authorities to withdraw restrictions upon counter-raiding across the border. The Abyssinian Government, however, has for some time contemplated the despatch of a punitive expedition against the Ogaden, and such an expedition, if successful, would probably secure the removal of Kedani. Meanwhile the Ogaden chiefs have been deterred by him from coming in to treat with us peaceably for the return of looted stock. The District Com missioner, Hargeisa, wrote on May 23 : “1 feel sure that what amounted to a flat refusal by the Ogaden to come in and see me was directly due to Kedani’s influence with them. I have it on good authority that he told them on no account to negotiate with the British Government, because Lij Yasu was coming back very soon with increased power and would assuredly punish any tribe who disobeyed the orders of his right-hand man. Under date June 6, our Minister at Adis Abeba reported that the plateau of Magdala, where Lij Yasu is, had been surrounded bv the troops of Fit. Hapta Giorgis, Ras Kassa and Ras Abata : but, as the rains had already begun, a definite issue could hardly be looked for this year.. The Government troops will not be able long to keep the field, or even stay m the neighbourhood of Magdala ; and the chance of Lij \ asu either surrendering or bolting is small. He will more probably hold out and defy his assailants. Meanwhile, though, during the six months of the rains, the Government’s position is not likely _ to o-et much worse, it will not get any better, if Lij Yasu lemams at large. Ras Taffari cannot cope with the situation and dares neither to lay hands on dangerous disaffected chiefs, noi to initiate any of the reforms which he knows to be necessary. e is keeping Ras Sevyum of Tigre and Ras Hailu of Gojjam m honourable detention at Adis Abeba for the summer and when let go, these chiefs are likely to carry away a wholehearted con tempt for his authority.SECRET.

Cornwallis, Major, Director, Arab Bureau.\ — 298 — ARABIA. Hejaz. Intelligence. Little news has come in concerning the operations of the four sons o£ the King of the Hejaz. fehenf he,sal has now moved inland from Wejh and, if all goes well may be ejected to ioin issue with the Turks near £1 l la about the middle of the month It is more than likely that the latter have got wind of Ids movements, and already there have been indications that the El Fla area is being reinforced. The scarcity of water is likely fzv flip Arabs. Information received by way of Jedda fiom an Egyptian who escaped from Medina about the middle of May is mostly confirmatory of what has already been recorded in these pages. Informant places the civilian population of Medina at a lower figure than had hitherto been reported and states that there were only between 500 to 1,000 men, all of whom had been retained by the military authorities for labour purposes. The food supplies he reckoned sufficient for one year for the present garrison and reduced number of inhabitants. This is being supplemented by the sowing of grain in the gardens north of the town, which will maintain '500 people. Water is plentiful both outside the town and within. Supplies continue to arrive from the north at irregular intervals and four or five camel loads had been brought in by the Arabs from the West. This is interesting, as showing that some of the supplies sent by us to the Arabs are finding their way into wrong hands. I his is inevitable once the supplies are distributed to the tribal groups, but there is nothing to show that it is taking place on any^ large scale, The Arabs have been allowed to come with their camels quite close to Medina in order to remove refugees, and surreptitious smuggling is probably not a difficult matter. The King of the Hejaz places the blame on Idrisi dhows, which are alleged to be landing unauthorised cargoes. Informant states that there are twenty-six fortified posts round the town. All the surrounding hills have been occupied, the strongest force being on Jebel Jehannum, which is the key to the whole position. The Mosque of Haroun is being used as a store for food supplies and a machine gun has been placed in the minaret. The Howeitat in the neighbourhood of Maan have recently broken into active revolt and have already caused considerable embarrassment to the enemy. Fighting began by attacks on the same day against El Fuwella on the Akaba-Maan' road, resulting- in the communications between these two places being cut, and against Meriga, where twelve Turks were killed, including Capt. Ahmed Hikmet, O.C. Cavalry Squadron, and one gun was captured. A grazing patrol was also set upon at Ain el Jerbah,near Shobek, but succeeded in escaping with the loss of one man wounded and five animals killed. Following on this, the movement has spread south. Rails have been blown up in the neighbourhood of Gadir el Haj station and a repair gang of fourteen men was attacked near Tell el Shahm station, suffering losses of one Turk killed, three wounded and eight captured. The telegraph line near Wadi Retim has been damaged and fighting has occurred in the neighbourhood. The telegraph wires and instruments have also been destroyed at Fawira, a place not yet identified, and the Mamur of the place has been killed. The Arabs appear to have their headquarters at Bair wells to the north-east of Maan, where they have reopened the wells. The full extent of the revolt is not yet known, nor whether the Howeitat only are participating, but the results already achieved have proved a very timely diversion and must have distracted the attention of the Turks from the Arab preparations further south. Further reports from Sherif Zeid about his fight with the forces of Ibn Rashid, mentioned on page 291 above, show that the enemy convoy was larger than was at first supposed. Sherif Zeid claims to have captured four mountain guns, more than 200 rifles with a large quantity of ammunition, o,000 loaded camels, including Ibn Leilah’s riding camel, a further herd of camels, including 200 untrained she-camels, and Ibn Rashid’s standards. The enemy’s losses in killed, described at first in one of the Emir’s letters as “ of a number innumerable,” are notv placed at seventy-six, including the brother of Ghalib Bey, Commandant of Medina. Lieut.-Colonel Neireorn.be s Report. Colonel Newcombe sends a report of his recent movements to June 23. Preceded by Lieut. Hornby with thirty Egyptians and an Indian party of four machine-guns, he left Wejh on June 14 by car, joining Lieut. Hornby at Beda the same evening. I he going was good as far as Abu Gazaz, after which he had to push the car through sand for some miles. He moved off on the 16th, reaching Tefiha (unidentified on the map) on the 18th, where he found Khaled Effendi with 110 men. Being informed that there was water at El Righai he made his way there with the intention of proceeding next day to Iharba, but on reaching LI big ru found no water and had to go instead to Ansheifa, with the a ca of going on to Gharib and attacking the i ail way thence, further report reaching him, however, that the water was short at Gharib, caused him to return to Tefiha and try another route to Tharba via Urish, by which the water was said to be ample,— 300 — i i^llv At Tefiba, on June 22, he heard though the roai ^- y re J t ' e( j to } ia ve Oiled in the wells at that the ^ ur ^ h \ lal an( \ t } iat probably there is no water near Tharba and at , , p )erra Iiear Moadhdham and at places near the line, excep d Hornby was sent on to Tharba to Kalaat uni rep orts prove true, the projects of attacking re live between Meda P in Saleh and El Ula will have to be abandoned. The Northward Move. Report reaches us from Wejh, under date June 30, as follows :— a Audeh abu Tayyeh arrived at Kasr el Azrak, and many Arabs have come to him to submit loyalty and to fight under the tlao- which was given to him by H.li. Shenf Feisal with Sherd Nasir, Nasib el Bakry and Captain Lawrence. The Turkish Government hearing that Audeh had joined the Sherif’s army, sent a force and destroyed El Gifa wells (Wells east of Maan) knowing that Audeh will make this place his headquarters.” This is the first news we have had of the doings of Abu Tayyeh since he started north with Captain Lawrence, Sherif Nash- and Nasib el-Bakry. Kasr el-Azrak is east of Salt, about 120 miles north of the Jafar depression (El Gifa, above). It is doubtful whether we should understand that Captain Lawrence is with him there, dr whether in fact the party, after showing itself in the north, has returned to the Maan district and is now directing the operations of the Howeitat, elsewhere reported, whose activity without this direction it is difficult to account for. SYRIA. Attack on the Ansariyah. We are able to supplement the information about the Ansariyah given in No. 54 of the Bulletin by further reports just received to the effect that, on May 26, Aziz Bey, Commandant of Gendarmerie at Latakiya, left with 300 to 400 men to attack the Kalbiah {see pp. 281 &amp; 284) refractories. I hey entered the villages of Bostan Pasha and Ibrahim Makhluf, pillaged everything they could lay hold of, violated the women, and sent a few shepherds as prisoners to Jebele. If the Ansariyah are anything like as numerous and brave as they are reported (the'Kalbiah section are stated to be able tomuster some 8,000 rifles), it is not clear why they showed no fight, especially as they are supposed to be particular^ sensitive in the matter of their women. They seem, however, to have limited themselves to assuming a threatening attitude and refusing offers made by Aziz to their chiefs to treat with him. Aziz is said to have established himself in the village of Batra (?) and to have telegraphed for reinforcements to Jemal, who replied that he could not spare a man and that Aziz should try to arrange the matter amicably. The troops are reported to have stayed on in Batra, robbing the neighbouring villages of sheep, fowls, and anything else they can lay their hands on. A French trawler which fired some shots is said to have much frightened Aziz and to have filled the Ansariyah with hopes of coming Allied assistance. AFGHANISTAN The Amirs views on the situation. Although only the last paragraph of the following is strictly within our field, we include it as showing the effect of probable German propaganda on a friendly Moslem Sovereign. A Durbar was held at Kabul on May 26, 1917, at which the Amir is reported to have referred to the war with more freedom than usual. His remarks are summarised by the British Agent in Kabul as follows “ Briefly, he said the war was very fierce on the French front, where the Germans had recently recaptured a few positions from the Anglo-French forces, but no decisive sign was yet in sight. America had also entered into the war on the side of the Allies, but it would take long before the martial energies of the nation revived and came into action to the advantage of the Allies, because America has long been addicted to internal peace, policy and civilisation of a high order, and consequently their genius or spirit of fighting as a nation or of military capability was totally extinct, and her intervention in the war was intentionally caused and sought by Germany for two reasons : (a) because America could have otherwise attained so high a position, in commerce economy, and wealth, by remaining a source of supply of war materials to the Allies during the war, as to make it absolutely impossible for Germany to compete with her for centuries after the war ; and (b) because by plunging America in the same trouble as Germany was herself suffering from, the former would be deprived of all chance of making any advance in her own social life as well as of continuing to be a source of contribution to the Allies.quite abruptly ana ” ' ‘Vear an.

Hejaz. .. A detachment of Sherif Abdulla’s army has captured a mai coming from El Moadhdham for Ibn Rashid. It contame telegrams from Sherif Haidar (at Damascus) and Enver Faslia to Ibn Rashid, congratulating him on joining his army to defeat the rebels. This tends to confirm the report that Ibn Rashid i\a. present at the recent engagement with Zeid s forces. ^ From the first attempt at organised military intelligenc obtained through an Arab Intelligence Officer we hear t an twenty to forty rails are kept at every station, 3,000 rails beingat Medina, and 100 to 200 at El Ula and Medain Saleh. There is no water at most of the stations, and it is brought to them by means of the trains. Most of the wells near the line have been destroyed by the Turks. Under date July 4, we hear that a detachment, under Lieut. Zemori, of the Spahis, has blown up for a length of about ten metres a viaduct north of Mektum and destroyed several lengths of rails to the west (?) of it. It is not possible to locate Mektum, but it is presumed to be in the area where Sherif Ali is operating, just north of Medina, he being the only one of the Sherifian brothers known to have any Spain officers attached. Some chiefs of the Beni Atiyeh and some of the Ibn Jazi sections of the Howeitat have arrived at Dhabah. It may be remembered that Hamid ibn Jazi, chief of this section, who was recently decorated by the Turks, was reported some time ago as having announced his allegiance to the Sherif. It is believed that he has not been concerned on either side in the recent operations round Maan. On June 24, Sherif Feisal stated he had received a letter from Sherif Mohammed Ali at Dhabah, saying that an Arab, who had come in from the North, reported that Captain Lawrence—with Sherif Nasr and Audeh Abu Tayyeh—had gone north towards Jehel Druz and that he had destroyed a very high bridge near Maan. Sherif Feisal pointed out that this was only an Arab rumour and possibly not true. It is stated that, after the defeat of Ibn Rashid by Sherif Zeid, some of the Shammar chiefs joined Sherif Abdullah’s forces, including Ibn Ajil. If this is Aqab ibn Ajil, one of the principal Abdah Sheikhs and grand-uncle of Ibn Rashid, the report of his death received some time ago (see p. 203) is incorrect. Paper Money in Syria. The Turks appear to be enforcing their threats of punish ment of those who contribute to the depreciation of their paper money by exchanging it for less than its due value. Recently, at Beirut, the police gave one of their secret agents L. 1. 400 in paper for the purpose of changing it into gold. He eventually changed it at a jeweller’s shop at the rate of 25‘o piastres to the Turkish pound. Five hours afterwards the jeweller was arrested by the police and asked to explain the transaction. ^ After having been soundly thrashed, he admitted the transaction and, when he was ordered to give up the notes, said that he had aheady sold them to some one else, who had in turn sold them to a third person and so on. Seven persons were successively arrested. The following current prices are reported : L.T.l paper money 25—25*5 piastres. 1 mark 5— 5*5 ,, 1 krone 2— 2*5 ??— 304 — Boro “r4ilC”'has Visited Magnah (Gulf of Aqaba) 1 he blieie ,/ f • ji arlc [ W as informed that the and found the tn^es ie^^ j^jly also.

On June 30 some Turkish guns fired back but did no damage, while the ships replied, starting a large fire ashore. On July 6, all civilian inhabitants were reported to have left while 200 or 300 soldiers, some of whom are believed to come from the Idrisi front, and a larger gun are reinforcing the garrison. The ships meanwhile remain. 1 f1Y ' VAT ’ Tmr ha * The governor has 11 -T -»» 4- r\ good treatment of the prisoners. Hodeidah is a centre of trade for smaller towns, and considerable business is done there. It has been a mainstay to the Turks, who obtained a local loan of £10,000 in June. I he Governor of Hodeidah complained to the Wali, previously to the bombardment, that the patrol ships’ activities were causing the richer merchants to leave the place and that there was a tendency among the inhabitants to panic. It may be hoped that a continuance of these activities will deter the resumption of business and that Turkish finances will suffer accordingly. Yemen Neivs. The unrest against the Turks and the Imam appears to be spreading, owing to an event that Aden informs us may influence the future of the Yemen to a great extent, namely, the beheading by the former of Naqib Hassan Abu Ras, a prominent member of Dim Mohammed, the chief section of the Bekil tribe. He was a friend of the Imam Yahya and an official under him, acting also as a tax-collector for the Turks. As it is thought the Turks would not have ventured on this step without the acquiescence of the Imam, he also is involved, and the opinion is that it will lead to a general rising against both him and the Turks. The Hashid and Bekil are said to be seeking vengeance, and Bias Bey, Kaimmakam of Ibb* is being reinforced by a few— 305 — ^ rorri t ^aOnr and Waht to help him against them. The adherents of Abu Has are also reported to be fighting Mohammed Nasir Muqbil, who, according to a Lahej rumour, is responsible foi the killing of Said Ahmed Pasha of Taiz, and who has had to withdraw fifty of his Arabs from Lahej in consequence. Aden informs us that negotiations are in progress between Seyyid Mohammed Darwish, of Riyashia, in the Qatabah district, who revolted against the Turks about a month ago (see p. 272), Seif el Islam Mohammed el Mutawwakil, a relative of the Imam and one of his chiel generals and advisers, and Seyyid Mohannhed Yahya ibn el Madi (see pp. 254, where he is called Seyyid Mohammed el Qasim, and 286), who, it appears, is the father of the new claimant to the Imamate and not, as we thought, the claimant himself, whose name is Yahya. Seyyid Mohammed was, however, the writer of the letter to the Resident, Aden, mentioned on page 255. Seif el Islam was recently reported as occupying the Radaa district up to the borders of Yafa with an Imamite force of 1,500 men, operating against the Juben, Xawa and Rubiatein. His defection from the Imam to Seyyid Mohammed may be expected to have far-reaching results. A report, which is considered reliable, has been received at Aden that the Turks are taking steps to re-occupy Salif. They are said to have moved a small force from Loheiyah towards Salif, and some 250 men with four maxims from Jarb, of whom some were approaching Salif on dune 20. According to another report, which the O.f '. Kamaran considers reliable but exaggerated, 2,000 Arabs and a few Turks with them, are concentrating at Khoba to attack Salif. Aden JSews. Letters received at Aden from Radian state that Seyyid Mohammed Darwish, in preparation for an attack on Qataba, has collected a large force at Jebel Murus and has warned the Radfan tribesmen-to hold themselves in readiness. The Alawi Sheikh’s son writes that, owing to recent casualties, the Turks at Lahej are demoralised, and realise that if they left they would be killed in the Yemen. Abdul Qadir, grandson of the Fadhli Sultan, has sent in a letter from Ali Said Pasha to the Sultan, referring to our recent raid into the Fadhli country (see p. 243), and describing our action as cowardly and intended merely to frighten women and children. The Pasha asks for accurate information as to our intention to station troops in the country so that he can despatch a force and capture them. Abdul Qadir, who recently made an appeal to us in hopes of getting his old grandfather restored to favour, as he is on the verge of the grave, now says that he finds the Sultan cannot dissociate himself from the Turks, whom he has invited to come and live at his capital.ARAB BULLETIN.

The operations of Sherif Feisal, already alluded to in the last bulletin, were begun on the night of July 6 by a success ful raid on the railway just south of Seil Matara, of which a full report will be found below. On the same night, another attack was made between Mabrak el Naka and Abu Taka, resulting in the destruction of 150 rails and twenty-four telegraph poles. Full details of this have not yet been received. Since these episodes there has been a lull, chiefly due to the departure for a few days of Sherif Feisal to Sherif Abdullah’s camp. The aeroplanes have, however, been active, and on the 12th inst. dropped fourteen 20 -lb. bombs on El Ula, causing damage to the station buildings and water tank enclosure. They estimated the garrison at less than 1,000 men with 200 mules. Reports from various sources agree that there is a serious shortage of food, fodder and wood in the Turkish camps from Maan to Medain Saleh. This has led to discontent among the Arabs who have hitherto been faithful to the Turks, and the open disaffection of the Beni Atiyah tribe, who, after destroying the line near Wadi Ethil and capturing some Turkish soldiers, have threatened the Turkish garrison at Tebuk. Sheikh Sultan of the Fuqara, near Medain Saleh, has also come over to the Arabs and it is said that orders dor his arrest have been issued by the Turks. Some of the Billi constituents are still faithful to the enemy, but the followers of Sheikh Eid, the cousin of Sheikh Suleiman Rifada {see Bulletin 1916, p. 227) are reported to be wavering- owing to the non-receipt of supplies. An explanation of the recent activity of the tribes round Maan, referred to in the last bulletin, has reached us in the person of Capt. Lawrence, after coloured adventures in that district. The results achieved may be summarised as follows : He left Wejh on May 9 with Sherif Nasir ibn Husein as O.C. Expedition, and Eesib Bey el Bakri as Political Officer, picked up thirty-six men and also Auda Abu Tayi (of whom more below) and he arrived at Akaba on July 8 with an army of 2,000 Arabs, and a tally to their credit of 700 dead Turks and 600 prisoners. The Arab concentration, which, to produce these results, they had busied themselves informing, took place at El Bair to the K.E. of Maan and was under the general command of Sherif Nasir. The main force moved to El Jafar on June 50, dealing one well, and thence to kilo. 479 where the line was destroyed on a large scale, while a column was attacking A. of Maan near Aneyza. The Arabs then marched towards Fuweilab, where the gendarme post had been destroyed by an advance column. Fhey were met with the news of the re-occupation of Fuweilah by a belated- 308 — . n.,- n f the 4th Battn. o£ the 174th Regt. rehef ° £ Jl tel v defeated on July 2 at Abu I Maan. from ,, 'Kirwas completely defeated on July 2 at Abu Lissan, Maan. 1 his J a m ^ unta m gun being captured, and the the O.O., annihilated.

Of these, the German, twenty-five Turkish officers and 360 rank and file have been sent to Fg) pt, while the remainder, being Arabs or Syrians, have volunteered and been incorporated into the Arab army. I he I urkish dead are estimated at 700. The forces which accomplished these remarkably successful operations were mainly Abu Tayyi Howeitat under Sheikh Auda U)u Tayi, Kualla Anazeh under Sheikh ibn Dughmi and Sherarat Their losses were only four men killed and five men wounded in the actual fighting, though an old man, six women and seven children were surprised m then tents ly\ a Fuikish cavalry patrol and slaughtered. At present some 5,000 Arabs are in arms in the Maan area. Reports show that the Turks fully realise the danger of the threat and are likely to attempt strong measures. They are already reported to have brought down some mule mounted companies to Maan and to have enlisted the help of 500 Beni Sakhr Arabs, 250 from Kerak and fifty of the Khoreisha Howeitat. Sheikh Fawwaz ibn Faiz of the Beni Sakhr, who was one of their chief supports, has died within the last few weeks. Sheikh Mishkal is mentioned as his successor and they can count on Sheikh Hamed el Arar, but the Trad and Zebu elements of the Beni Sakhr, as well as the larger portion of the Ibn Jazi section, are on the side of the Sherd. From all that Capt. Fawrence could hear, the disposition of the northern tribes is increasingly anti-Turk and favourable to the Sherif of Mecca. Sheikh Nuri Shaalan and his son Nawwaf have re-affirmed their loyalty. The Druses are deeply incensed against the Turks and the same feeling exists among the Serdiyah, the Jebeliyah and the Metawala of Anti Febanon and the Orontes valley. Sheikh Fahad ibn Hadhdhal of the Amarat has come in to Bagdad and offered the whole hearted support of himself and his tribes and there is reason to believe that the Western Bishr and border tribes from Homs to Aleppo are equally ready to cut loose from the I urks should a favourable occasion arise.The lloweitat and their chiefs. 1 he Howeitat used to be all under Ibn Rashid—a family which still exists in the Akaba in the Hisma, but is grown poor and weak. '1 hey were then for a little presided over by Ibn Jazi; and from this period dates their sub-division into discordant sections with independent foreign policies. The Abu Tayi sub-section is the joint work of Auda, the fighting man, and Mohammed el-Dheilan, the thinker. It fell out with Ibn Jazi over the latter’s treatment of a Sherari guest of Auda’s, and in the fifteen year old feud Annad, Auda’s full grown son was killed. This feud is the greatest of the Sherif’s difficulties in the operations lately at Maan and has driven Hamed el-Arar, the “ibn Jazi ” of to-day, into the arms of the Turks, while Saheiman Abu Tiyur and the rest of the sub-tribe are at Wejh with Sidi Feisal. Auda has offered them peace and friendship at the request of Feisal ; and it was perhaps the hardest thing the old man has ever had to do. The death of Annad killed all his hopes and ambitions for the Abu Tayi in the desert, and has made his liie a bitter failure ; but it is a fixed principle of the -Sherif that his followers have no blood feuds, and no Arab enemies, save the Shammar, who are enemies of the Arab. His success in burying the innumerable hatchets of the Hejaz, is the most pregnant indication of his future government. In all Arab minds the Sherif now stands above tribes, the tribal sheikhs and tribal jealousies. His is the dignity of the peacemaker, and the prestige of independent, superposed authority. He does not take sides or declare in their disputes : he mediates, and ensues a settlement. The head man of the Abu Tayi is, of course, the inimitable Auda. He must be nearly fifty now (he admits forty) and his black beard is tinged with white, but he is still tall and straight, loosely built, spare and powerful, and as active as a much younger man. His lined and haggard face is pine bedouin . broad low forehead, high sharp hooked nose, brown-green eyes, slanting outward, large mouth, (now unfortunately toothless, loi his false teeth were Turkish, and his patriotism made him sacrifice them with a hammer, the day he swore allegiance to Feisal in Wejh), pointed beard and moustache, with the lower jaw shaven clean in the Howeitat style. The Howeitat pride themselves on being altogether Bedu, and Auda is the essence o the Abu Tayi. His hospitality is sweeping (inconvenient, except to very hungry souls): his generosity has reduced him to poverty, and devoured the profits of a hundred successful raids. He has married twenty-eight times, has been wounded thirteen times, and in his battles has seen all his tribesmen hurt, and most of his relations killed. He has only reported his “kill since 1900 and they now stand at seventy-five Arabs; Turks are not counted'by Auda when they are dead. Under Ins handling the Toweihah have become the finest fighting force m Western Arabia. He raids as often as he can each year ( but a year_ 310 — msses so quickly, Sidi”) and has seen Aleppo, Basra, Taif, \Vejh and Wadi Dawasir in Ids armed expeditions. In his way Auda is as hard-headed as he is hot-headed. His mtience is extreme, and he receives (and ignores) advice, criticism or abuse with a smile as constant as it is very charming. Nothing on earth would make him change his mind or obey an order or follow a course he disapproved He sees life as a sage and all events in it are significant and all personages heroic. His ‘mind is packed (and generally overflows) with stories of old raids and epic poems of fights. When he cannot secure a listener he sings to himself in his tremendous voice, which is also deep and musical. In the echoing valleys of Arnousa, our oaiide in night marches was this wonderful voice of Auda’s, conversing far in the van, and being rolled back to us from the broken faces of the cliffs. He speaks of himself in the third person, and he is so sure of his fame that he delights to roar out stories 5 against himself. At times he seems seized with a demon of mischief and in large gatherings shouts appalling stories of the private matters of his host or guests : with all this he is modest, simple as a child, direct, honest, kind-hearted, affectionate, and warmly loved even by those to whom he is most trying—his f nn rl He is rather like Caisars tribe, in his faculty for keeping round him a free territory, and then a great ring of enemies. Nuri Shaalan pretends only to love Auda—but in reality he and the Sukhur, and all friendly chiefs also, go about in terror lest they should offend in some way against Auda’s pleasure. He loses no opportunity of adding to his enemies and relishes the new situation most because it is an ideal excuse to take on the Turkish Government. “To the Mutessarif of Kerak from Auda abu Tavi greeting. Take notice to quit Arab territory before the end of Ramadan. We want it for ourselves. Should you not go, I declare you outlawed and God will decide between us.” Such was Auda’s cartel to the Government the day we struck. After Auda, Mohammed el Dheilan is the chief figure in the tribe. He is taller than Auda, and massively built, a square headed intelligent, thoughtful man of perhaps thirty-five, with a sour humour and a kind heart carefully concealed beneath it. In his youth he was notoriously wild, but reformed himself the night he was condemned to be hanged bv Nevris Bev, Sami Pashas Staff Officer, and has repaid many of the injuries he once wrought. He acted as business manager of the Abu Tavi and their spokesman with the Government. His tastes are rather luscious, and his ploughed land at Tafileh and his little house at him to luxuries which took root among the waters and parasols of a Howeitat richer than Auda, more Maan introduced tribe: hence the mineral (xhazzu. Mohammed is leeper—but a calculating, o' greedy. fine fighting man too, and one whoknows how to appeal to everything in his hearers’ natures, and to bend them to Ins will by words. Zaal ibn Motlog is Auda’s nephew. He is about twenty-five, with petite features, carefully curled moustache, polished teeth, trimmed and pointed beard, like a French professional man. He, too, is greedy (of all Arabs I have met the Howeitat were the most open, most constant, most shameless beggars, wearying one day and night with their mean importunities and preposterous demands), sharp as a needle, of no great mental strength, but trained for years by Auda as chief scout to the tribe, and therefore a most capable and dashing commander of a raid. Auda ibn Zaal is the fourth great man of Abu Tayi. He is silent and more usual in type than Auda, Mohammed, or Zaal, but the Howeitat flock to his side when there is a raid, and say that in action for concentrated force he is second only to Auda, with something of the skill of Mohammed super-added. Personally I have seen all four chiefs under fire, and saw in them all a headlong unreasoning dash and courage that accounted easily for the scarred and mutilated figures of their tribesmen. The fighting strength of the Abu Tayi is 535 camelmen and twenty-five horsemen. T. E. L. Raid on the Railway. The following is condensed from reports of Lieut.-Colonel Newcombe, in dontinuation of his report given on pages 299 and 300, and of Miralai Davenport Bey :— Col. Newcoinbe waited with Khaled Effendi’s Arabs at Tefiha till the return of Capt. Hornby from his reconnaissance. This showed that the road via Ourash to Shellal was not safe, Shellal being only three miles from Medain Saleh, but a different road was found direct from lefiha to lharba, twelve miles distant and one hour from the railway N.W. of Mabrak el Naka, and where there was good water. He instructed Ivhaled Eftendi and Capt. Hornby to go to Tharba and cut the railway from there and other water pools to the north. On June 27 Col. New combe returned to Jeida (50 miles) visited Weih, where he conferred with Sherif Feisal and picked up Jaafar Pasha and, returning via Jeida, reached Wagir on the nio-ht of July 4, with Lieut.-Colonel Joyce, Miralai Davenport Bey, Lieut. Wade (of Armoured Cars), Indians and about one hundred Egyptians and some Bisha, also Sheikh Hamad el Maimara and Sherif Ali Husein. 1 he distance to the railway from Wagir was over thirty miles, and there was no water on the wav The enterprise was therefore rather formidable, ihey felt early on July 6, getting within sight of the railway, after a very hot day’s march at three miles an hour, at 6 p.m. Here they312 - —. nr 1 ir w5 5 \2 a.m. on the ’ . ^ ()f fifty-five Egyptians with three demolition P al ' ■ u i cl , q 0 j_ Newcombe and Col.

The Bashawish’and three of the men turned up, however, two days later having been shown water by some Bedouin. Except for the regretted loss of the other two men, the raid was very successful, considering that all the Egyptians were new to the work of laying and firing explosives, while the very long way (sixty-five miles there and back) without water made the journey one of haste. Col. Joyce left straight from the railway to join Sherif Abdullah near Wadi Ais, about sixty miles south, Col. Newcombe returned to Jeida, and Miralai Davenport went on to a well which Col. Newcombe had ordered to be cleared out at Bir Salim (? Saleh) in the Wadi Jizzil. Water had been found, and this will enable the base to be brought to within only twenty miles from the railway. From here Miralai Davenport was to start fresh raids on the line, and a French party with Bedouin was expected to reach him about the 13th. Capt. Hornby is believed to be active north of Medain Saleh and Ali el Ula near Moadhdham. But, as Col. Newcombe closes his report, “In this very waterless country of long distances and very misleading Bedouin (misleading partly due to' ignorance, partly because their sole thoughts are ninnpv firtrl Tint wa.r 'l miv settled nrofrramme is imDOSsible. Letter from Sherif Abdullah to King Lfusein. Abi Markhah, 9th Ramadan, 1335. To the Master of Favours, May God protect him and grant him victory. The slave has returned to his place. The people are commencing the advance which will be crowned with victory and success by the will of God.We are awaiting the arrival of the Army at Wejh to their central station which is probably Gayadah. On their arrival we shall also move to either Hadiyah or Bueir. From Hadiyah we can easily communicate with the Wejh army and prevent the Turkish forces at Hadiyah from assisting the forces at El Ula. But Bueir is protected and well fortified, and if, which God forbid, the Wejh army does not succeed and the enemy withstands their attacks, the Turkish force is unable to drive us from our place except by means of two divisions, which they cannot get because of the scarcity of the water and camel men. I have left the matter of choosing one of the two places above named to your slave, my brother Feisal, according to his needs. On my return, 0 Master of Favours, I found the place full of Shammar tribes, so that some of the weak-minded thought that it was a mere strategem (on the part of our enemies). To-day El Ajil and El Said [sub-tribe of the Butun section of the Dhafir, whose chief is Hamud ibn Suweit] have arrived with their camels and Abd Aqab ibn Ajil (see p. 303) is with them. They all took the oath of loyalty and swore that all our enemies are their enemies and their friends our friends and they went to El Seir. I have sent four of them to their Sheikh and Emir to see whether they are with us or not ; if not, they had better go to wherever we may tell them. As Ibn Ajil is the Vizier of Ibn el Rashid I thought it better not to send his people back with their camels, lest they might think that we are weak. 1 have dug some wells for them at El Seir, even fifty wells are not enough for these Shammar. To-day also, Duleim ibn Barak [chief of the Beni Rashid sub-tribe of the HuteimJ arrived here with 700 camel men, and all the Sheikhs of the Huteim who have left Ibn el Rashid entirely and went to El Harrak. They are fair fighters and 1 shall treat them kindly and hospitably. 0 Master of Favours, my place became like the day of resurrection because of the multitudes of people coming. Che camels of the people who came number more than 3,000. The supplies here not being sufticient, 1 was compelled to buy 200 sacks of rice from Yambo to meet this sudden Hood which is increasing wonderfully. Mijlad el-Ajman [Dahamishah tribe of the Amarat, between Jauf and Basrah] came and informed me that many more people are still coming. Therefore, I suggest that my supplies should be increased and an extra £10,000 be sent for the sake ol the newcomers, otherwise I shall spend the pay of the troops on the newcomers and presents for them.

MESOPOTAMIA. The Situation in Hail. Suleiman el-Dakhil, a native of Bureidah, one of whose daughters is married to Ibn Saud, has recently arrived u, Baghdad, f n n Hail. Formerly in Baghdad, he had fal en under suspicion of the Ottoman Government owing to an article in Ins newspaper uro-ing the Government not to quarrel with Ibn &gt; and and, after tie war broke out, went first to Nejt and thence to Hail, where L evaded the arrest which the Government ordered by telegraph. Ibn Rashid interceded for him but received no reply and el-Dakhil on hearing that we were established in Baghdad, made his way there. The following, according to his account, is the position in Hail : There are three parties, Rashid ibn Leilah’s friends, the Shammar and townsfolk who want to come in to us, on the ground that if we hold Iraq there is no other alternative and the Emir, who, up to now, lias been under the thumb of Ibn Leilah. The latter has been heavily bribed by the Turks. Of the moneys entrusted to him for Hail he has appropriated about three-fourths investing it in property in Constantinople. _ Of the one-fourth which reaches Hail, one-third _ goes to his own supporters, one-third to the Emir and one-third to the bhammar. The Shammar complain that they get no profit out of the Turkish alliance. The Ottoman representative at Hail is Abdul Hamid, an Egyptian. He has quarrelled with Ibn Leilah, and has retired to Mustajiddah. The Emir has forbidden him to go on to the railway. He and Ibn Leilab send mutual recriminations to Jemal Pasha, Abdul Hamid saying that it is all Ibn Leilah’s fault that Ibn Rashid has done nothing, and vice versa. Suleiman was in Hail when Ibn Subhan quarrelled with the Emir and came to us. The cause of the quarrel was chiefly Ibn Subhan’s antagonism to Ibn Leilah and jealousy of him. *[Note by Arab Bureau. This final paragraph is not of good omen for Arab unity.] Ifr^utm-Ksa ^-..acv&amp;aaaa Suleiman heard that a good many Shammar Sheikhs have recently joined Ibn Subham A1 Baij of the Sinjarah, A1 Maij and Nida ibn Nukhaiyir of the Abdah and Ibn Thanayan of the Sinjarah. They are all out against Ibn Leilah and his policy which they regard as suicidal to the Shammar. While Suleiman was at Hail one biggish caravan (200 camels) came in from Kuweit bringing petroleum, cotton cloth, tobacco, coffee, but not rice or dates. This was the one which started for the Qasim and split up half way, part going to Hail and part to the Qasim. Driblets have come in from Kuweit over and above this, forty camels at a time, but the merchants are now very much afraid of going to Kuweit fearing that Ibn Subhan will wive information against them and have them arrested. As for O O the caravan which came up recently to Nejf, it was at the outside 4,000 camels strong, it loaded in great haste, not more than one-third of its full load, and left about four days ago in very great alarm lest it should be captured on the return journey. This caravan was sent out from Hail as a feeler. They are at the end of their food supplies, they were not certain of the truth of the report that we were holding Baghdad and the Iraq and they sent up the caravan to spy out the land. Its experiences will encourage the Shammar Sheikhs and the townsfolk in their desire to come to terms with us. Suleiman says that Fahad Beg can absolutely control the whole Musablah from Nejd to the Iraq if he undertakes to do so. When he left Hail nothing was definitely known as to negotiations between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, but Suleiman had heard gossip that Ibn Rashid had asked for peace. He did not think that Ibn Saud would accept, as it was obviously not in his interest to do so. This is exactly what Ibn Saud said to us, but he added that he would come to terms with Ibn Rashid if we wished it. As to the position in the Qasim, Bureidah alone counts ; Aneizah will follow its head. It is true that the Qasim towns like a great deal of freedom but there is a strong party in Bureidah which does not wish for complete independence, for they fear that that would imply the return of their former Emirs, the Abu Hail, whom they hate. _ One of these, Mohammed, is now with Ibn Saud and stands high in his favour but is bitterly disliked at Bureidah. The other, Fahad, is at Hail and is much better liked-by the Bureidah people. He is anti-Turk. He refused an Ottoman subsidy. Ibn Sand’s overlordship is infimtel} preferable to that of Ibn Rashid. The Rashid have a name tor tyranny, whereas Ibn Saud deals very liberally with the Qasim towns and in ordinary times allows them complete freedom ol trade. Ibn Rashid is not popular. He never speaks m the Mejhs and does nothing to make himself a personal position. 1 tie— 316 — , if, fUp cons o£ his cousin Talal, who was murdered ''Tir ™ These boys I .saw three years , ,o in Ha 1 Abdullah and Mohammed are their names They loom nan, resDec tively twelve and eleven, charming fetin-dithed'children They are true Rashid and belong to an de, branch than that of the present Emir.

This year they refused to go out on the spring S unless the two boys were allowed to come also, and he Emir reluctantly consented. It is very improbable that the Shummar would accept an Emir outside the Rashid family. Urn SaucCs account of Ibn LeilaKs Defeat. A telegram from Sir Percy Cox of July 9 says that Ibn Sond under date June 16, communicates that he was leaving his sou Turki, at Qasim to watch Ibn Rashid, and expected himself to reach Riyadh on June 21. Ibn Sand gives further details of the recent fight between Ibn Rashid’s and Shenf Zeid’s forces. He says that Ibn Rashid sent Ibn Leilah with Turkish troops and a guard by the Hajar road to go to Medina or to gyria. When three days out from Jebel Sham mar, Ibn Leilah met the Hataim and the Firm Marly Arabs of Hajar, and heard that they intended to plunder him. Ibn Rashid came out to help, but, with the exception of a few men, his party fled. There were no Shammar with Ibn Rashid’s forces, as they had separated into two parties, one of which, the Aslam, joined Ibn baud. The second party, the Abdah, had intended to help Ibn Rashid, but, fearing that Ibn Saud would seize their property, they changed their minds. On hearing this, other Arabs who had been with [bn Rashid took refuge in the hills of Selmah and Aja. The action, in which Ibn Leilah and Ibn Rashid’s forces were scattered, took place at Dueim. They are said to have abandoned almost every thing, including loads of supplies intended for Medina. Twenty Turks and thirty men from Hail were reported killed, as well as Sezman Bey, the Turkish leader. Ibn Rashid himself escaped to Hifan near Hail. Ibn Leilah has guides from the Hataim and Harb with him, but is in danger from one of Ibn Sand’s parties and also from local people. Abyssinian Neics. Has Hailu of Gojjam, who had been detained in Adis Abeba, has received permission to return to his province after taking the most solemn oaths that he will remain faithful to the Empress and Ras Taffari.The question of Tigre has now been settled m so far as the re-distribution of provinces is concerned. Ras Seyyum has been 317 fc—sac^osssao. It is probable that he is in earnest in giving these assurances, and certain that he would oppose the return of Lij Yasu by every means in his power. He has, however, no illusions with regard to the rottenness of the present Government and makes no secret of his scorn of the Ministers, whom he looks upon as low-born persons who have no ideas beyond filling their own pockets, and it may be expected that he will only obey their orders so far as it suits him. He appreciates, however, the necessity of establishing a strong Government in Adis Abeba but his support of Ras Taffari will probably be as from a practically independent Prince treating with his equal. There is no question of the genuineness of his hatred for the Turks and Germans. He told the British Minister that, before leaving, he intended to see the Empress in the presence of Ras Taffari and Ras Seyyum and urge upon her the necessity of friendship with the three Powers who are her neighbours, and of putting an end to German intrigues even by dismissing the Germans and Turks from the country, pointing- out that if Abyssinia delays giving proof of her friendship until the victory of the Entente Powers is absolutely certain, the gift will then be valueless. In Ras Hailu’s own words “If England, France and Italy are to die, let us die with them, as the victory of Germany would mean the return of Lij Yasu who would establish a Moslem kingdom under the protection of Germany and Turkey.” The baneful activities of the outlaw, Kedani (see p. 295), are happily ended by his death in the course of a raid into British territory. About the middle of June, strong parties of Ogaden her Ali collected at Segudan just beyond our borders, where they were joined by Kedani and part of his Abyssinian following. Our western tribes, anticipating attack, took all necessary precaution and divided their riflemen and spearmen into two parties. When the attack was made at Warmarali, some ten miles_ within our territory, the first party adopted the usual Somali tactics of falling back and stimulating defeat. The raiders pressed on too eagerly, and were drawn into an ambush and outnumbered by the other party. Kedani and twenty-five Abyssinians were killed, and the rest' fled. A dangerous and troublesome personality is thus removed from our Northern frontier. We also hear from French sources that it is believed that two Germans who lately got out of Adis Abeba, perhaps with the intention of joining Lij Yasu, but, failing, took refuge among the tribes somewhere near Tajura, are being forced by lack of food jo return to Abyssinia. If this is true, another source of potential trouble is removed.— 318 — guard Dejaz Guksa S^ssf alter his C'“* Kift -s™ » K- I- -' ■ « » ■ »&gt; ”* Lii Yasu in Magdala. , • * n • The district o£ the two Tawlalo has been also given to Dejaz ^^The arrangement seems to be a satisfactory one as both Rases are contented to have made friends and the Government believe that they have guaranteed the future good behaviour of L Seyyum by placing on his borders lias Guksa h,s former rival, and Dejaz Tetla, who can overwhelm Tigre on the slightest sign of in subordination.

Kamaran reports a rumour that, in the early part o£ June, -or m riS i c ? rces ’ a£ter surrou nding Ibn Tawwab and some 600- / 00 1 urkish troops, were surprised in their sleep and defeated, but succeeded in holding their ground. No reliable account has however, yet been received, and Idrisi himself says nothing. Abu Ras. From further details received about the execution of Abu Ras {see p. 304) one may conclude that he only got his deserts from the Turkish point of view. It seems that he sent a party of fifteen armed men to the camp of Ibn Nasir Muqbil, to kill him. The party duly fired ^ off a volley, killing five soldiers and three other Arabs, but their chief quarry escaped. Abu Ras then waylaid and robbed a Turkish money convoy from Taiz, and eventually, after eluding a punitive force sent bv the Turks, he went with a party and bred at the Turkish camp near Taiz, when both he and his son were captured and executed. Money for Yemen. The arrival of the money at Sanaa, reported on page 270, is further confirmed by a Greek who escaped from Hodeidah. He says that the Imam refused to change any notes for the Turks. They talked of sending some of these to be sold at half-price at Hodeidah. As the current rate there for a £5 Turkish note is only Rs. 17 to 18, as against its normal value of Rs. 67, bidding is scarcely likely to be keen. The same informant says that large quantities of goods reach Hodeidah, and that the import dues amount to 1,000 to 2,000 dollars daily. The New Movement. This appears to be progressing. Kamaran reports that a meeting has taken place at Amran between Hizam Pasha of the Bekil and All Miqdad of the Anis, already mentioned (p. 256) as members of the confederacy, and the Sheikh of the Beni Matar. The Idrisi is said to be supplying Hizam with arms and ammunition. Raid Ahmed. We may briefly note here that Aden has replied negatively to a query raised on page 257 as to whether Kaid Ahmed of Hajariyah, another of the notables of the new confederacy, is the son of Ahmed Naaman, the late Kaimmakam of this district. It appears that he is the son of a former Kaimmakam, Ahmed bin Qasim, the succession to whom, as Kaimmakam, Ahmed Naaman by intrigues secured for himself to the exclusion of his predecessor’s family.No. 58.

After the successful raids of duly 7, reported in the last bulletin, Sherif Feisal, Gaafar Pasha and Col. New com be left deida by car on the 11th for Sherif Abdullah’s camp, where they arrived on the 14th. Abdullah stated that he was not ready to attack the railway as he had insufficient food supplies, owing to the arrival of a party of 2,000 Shamraar after the recent defeat of Ibn Rashid (.see p. old). He was anxious to postpone all operations for at least twenty days, but was finally persuaded by Col. Newcombe to make a combined attack with Feisal on the railway at the earliest possible date, pending a larger operation when he has more men ready. Col. doyce and twenty-five Egyptians were left with him to arrange dynamite parties for the first raid, which was timed to take place towards the end of July. El Ula was successfully bombed on July 1 5 by three aeroplanes. Three bombs fell on the station enclosure and one direct hit was observed on the water tanks. Damage was also done to buildings and camps. The enemy opened an ineffective fire with four guns. So far as we have heard, Arab operations in this area have been confined to the cutting of the telegraph line between Khamis and Dizad on July 19 and an attack by 800 Arabs on the Turkish patrols from Dizad to Khamis and Moadhdham towards the end of the month. The latter resulted apparently in about eight Turkish casualties and the withdrawal of the Arabs. A shortage of food is again reported along the line, especially in the Tebuk°area, where the Turks have been supplying some of the local Arabs as well as their own forces. All wood for the railway engines is being brought from Maan to the Medain Saleh area, where the stock has completely given out. Shortage of water is undoubtedly making operations very difficult in these regions. There has been a lull in the Maan area. At Akaba, Sherif Nasir ibn Hussein has approximately 800 men, of whom 300 are properly armed Ageyl from Wejh. Auda Abu Tayi, who is holding the road from Maan, is reputed to have 6,000 men at Fuweilah ; of these, 2,000 have rifles of British’or Turkish pattern, the remainder being armed with obsolete weapons. According to a somewhat obscure report which has been received the Turkish force under Jemal the Less advanced about July 25 towards Wegeidah, which is between Fuweilah ami Maan Station.

Prisoners captured at Akaba report that the troops under stood that they were in the district for garrison duty only, and were much surprised at the hostile attitude of the Arabs. All the Arab soldiers deserted the Turks. More recent information shows that the combined attack by the forces of Sherif Feisal and Sherif Abdullah took place at the end of the month, but the results are not yet fully known, it is reported that Turkish patrols were attacked by the Arabs trom Dhat el-Haj to Mustabgha on July 20, and that two lurks were wounded. A reinforcement train which was sent out on ' the following day to this section of the line was also attacked. Heavy fighting took place on July o0 and 81 at Kalaat el- Zumrud and between Sell Matara and Meshed, the Arabs having previouslv destroyed the railway between Zumrud-Seil Matara, Seil Matara-Meshed, and Meshed-Bedai. Several water trains were held up in this neighbourhood on the 81st, but the line between El-Ulaand Bedai is believed to have been cleared on thatday by a reinforcement train which brought up a mule M.l. Coy. Later reports state that numerous rails were damaged on the Bedai-Meshed and Toweira-Muderij sectors, and that on the latter sector, where the repairing party lost two killed and tvvo wounded, five bridges were also blown up. The Hadiyah-Abu el-Naim sector is said to have been reinforced by two Nordenfeldt guns from the Bir el-Mashi region. El-UJa is the present headquarters of the (1.0.C. Composite Force. The expected advance of the Turks from Maan towards Akaba has begun. A force estimated by the Arab leaders at sixbattalions with quick-firing guns and accompanied by some Arabs mis moved to Abu Lesal, near Fuweilah, and Auda Abu Tayi has a len back on Grueira. Reinforcements are bein&lt;&gt;’ hurried up from Akaba. I he Arab forces have killed twenty Turks and captured forty mules. Aeroplanes at Maan have recently been unable to fly, probably owing to lack of vacuum oil, but it is also reported that a new aeroplane has arrived from Damascus. The Arabs have blown up three arches of the bridge at Anzah station, north of Maan. YEMEN. Overtures from the Imam. The Imam Yahya, probably prompted by the knowledge that the new confederacy had appealed to the British Government for help, has sent a Sheikh from the Beni Siham section of the Khaulan el Tawal tribe to Aden with certain proposals. These a,re, briefly, that he is prepared to make an agreement with the British Government on condition (a) that he is given all Yemen, from Hali Point south, excluding Aden only, but including A sir and Hadramaut and all seaports in Yemen which used to belong to his predecessors ; (/&gt;) that Idrisi is eliminated from Arabia, and (c) that the Government agrees to communicate with the people of Yemen only through him, or with his knowledge. The Government is invited to give adequate financial assistance and to provide arms and ammunition immediately together with some quick-firing guns and personnel. The envoy claims that the Imam can call up the whole of Yemen at once, including Hashid and Bekil, and that all the tribes are on his side. This communication is interesting as showing the inordinate lengths to which an Arabian chief, isolated from the world, and surrounded by flatterers, can go. Since the days of Moawiya, under the fourth Khalifate, no rule in Yemen has extended to anything approaching the limits indicated by the Imam. Even in Central Yemen, among the Zeidis themselves, there has been no consecutive stable rule for long ; no dynasty has ever really established itself. Aet the present ruler claims the remote and Sunnite provinces of Ash and Hadramaut, though he must know that Sunnis, even within his present narrow limits, only accept his jurisdiction when backed by the machinery of the Ottoman Government. The Imam s influence southward follows the two trade routes^ to Aden, rh/ Musemir, or Dthala, and there have always been friendly relations between his house and Lahej, but it is difficult to imagine that big military tribes like Yafa, Aulaqi or Fadhli would brook e\en the semblance of his suzerainty and certainly not his spnitua dignity, for they are Sunnis throughout and look on him (when they consider him at all) as a schismatic.— 824 — .r . fho Aden Protectorate and Hinterland (excepting Moreovei, - ..irp-idv been approached by the Imam Beda, which Niltana e ]c ^ re ]ations with the Aden authorities with little result) have treaty .elan precluding such an ftn Asiri chief raIed there for As regards his ^ ^ Hussein of Abu Arish (a Wahabism m 1&lt; , Sanaa Imams) ruled Asir and the coast i — ** — ' “ Th.

New Claimant to Imamate. Aden sends us further details about Seyyid Mobaimned, the father of the new candidate to the Imamate. He hails trom Mayadar, in Habur, north of Shehara. Our suggestion on page 245 of No. 51, that he was Sheikh of Madan (Midan) m the Hashid country is not accepted by the Hashid messengers. I he genealogy is now given, by informants who claim to know the family history, as follows : (1) Al-Qasim ; (2) Mohammed el-Muayyad ; (3) el-Mortada; (4) el-Hadi; (5) el-Qasim ; (6) Ahmed ; (7) Yahya ; (8) Seyyid Af.u.nwwvroP • ( Yflhvfl. the. nresent candidate. This may be compared with the provisional genealogy given on page 254. Ihe conjecture there made that the succession is to be traced back to the Imam Qasim, prince of all Yemen in the seventeenth century, is confirmed, as is also the supposition that, in the name as first given us, some of the intermediate links had been skipped. Remarks on the Imamate. To assist in forming a just appreciation of the importance of the new movement headed by Seyyid Mohammed Yahya ihn el-Hadi in favour of his son Yahya*s claim to the Imamate, we print the following notes by Lieut. G. Wyman Bury, R.NA .h They are based on personal knowledge and on information from native sources :— An Imam must be of Fatimite descent, and, in practice, is always a scion of the original Rassite stock which founded the dynasty in the early tenth century. Theoretically, he isdesignated by bis predecessor at the instance of the Aid al-Akfah or fmam’s Council, which is first convened by the Imam at his accession, and may muster up to 200 members of the Ashraf and Sadah. It invites the Imam to appoint his successor before his demise, but, in actual practice, his choice is much swayed by this council, which elects Ins successor ii he dies without appointing anyone. An Imam may not be a minor, and he must also have attained distinction among ulema or theologians. Direct issue is set aside where these qualifications are wanting. The Imam may reside where he likes within territorial limits, but prestige attaches to residence at Sanaa. The earlier Imams lived at Sadhah, later at Sanaa, then at Kaukeban and afterwards at Sanaa again until the present Turkish occupation. There are two collateral houses, Sharaf ed-Din and Earned ed-I)in, between which the Imamate has oscillated for generations, thus fogging genealogies and continuity of succession, for the house to which the Imam belongs is seldom mentioned, so that he may either be a direct heir, or a distant relative of his predecessor. To understand the present situation in Yemen, we need only go back to Imam Mansur al-Qasim of the house of Sharaf ed-Din, which had been driven from Sanaa to Kaukeban and Sheharah by the first Turkish invasion in the sixteenth century and held sway in Sanaa again through Qasim alter the I urks had evacuated. Imam Qasim, who extended his power over all Yemen, set aside his own stock as lacking the necessary qualifi cations and appointed as his successor Hamid ed-Din ibn Mutahir, of the collateral house. The house of Sharaf ed-Din ruled again at Sanaa through Imam Hadi (No. T in the Aden genealogy given above), who was succeeded by three Imams of the Earned ed-Din house, the last of whom is the present ruler. The candidate is descended, as stated by Aden, from Imam Qasim of the Sharaf ed-Din house, to which natives allude as the Kaukeban house, calling that of Earned el-Din the Sanaa house. There is little to chose between the claims of either, except the prestige of Qasim and the fact that he set aside his own line for temporary disabilities only. The candidate’s father, Mohammed, held rank under the late Imam as “Emir al-Meidan,” which means,^ literally, “ Commander of the Plain, or Open Field” i.e. O.C. Cavalry. (No Yemen infantryman comes down on to level, open ground if he can help it.) Mhen the present Imam was invested with the “tag” or “ crown,” which is a gold-brocaded silk turban, he had to convene his council, and omitted to include Mohammed.Seyyicl Mohammed was furious. Apart from his services and rank under the late Imam, he considered his claim to the Imamate as good as Yahyas, or any member of the Hamed ed-Din house. He and the present Imam had also been rival students at the theological college of Madan, near Sheharah, and anyone who has heard''w/ma discussing each other can guage the bitterness of such a rivalry. Seyyid Mohammed took the field against the Imam soon after his accession some thirteen years ago. Backed by o,000—4,000 thditing men of Hajur (his district), he put up a very good fight for a year, but was eventually defeated and taken prisoner. His status as Seyyid saved him from the death penalty which any sacrilegious outsider would certainly have incurred. He considered that he would make a better Imam than Yahya, fought for his opinion and lost. Ho stigma attached to him among the Ashraf and Sadah, who procured his release after lie had been immured for some months in the fortress at Qaflat Udhr as a political prisoner. In this connection it should be noted that two Imams cannot co-exist amicably in Yemen, which has been rent by their quarrels for centuries. Each must be an impostor to the other and his adherents. The very name “ Imam ” implies a national leader who goes in front and shows the way. There can be but one right road any whither. Any suggestion that there should be more than one Imam is blasphemy to Zeidis and Sunnis alike in Yemen. After his release Seyyid Mohammed remained in comparative obscurity until the present crisis. He has presumably proposed his son as candidate in order to leave himself free as President of the League of Ashraf and Sadah, which may be identified with the Ahl al-Akfah — a potential Imam’s Council. The candidate’s position is much strengthened by the adherence of Seif ul-Islam. Seif nl-Islam Seyyid Mohammed Yusuf is of the house of Hamed ed-Din and one of the Imam’s best generals. After the Turks capitulated at Sanaa in 1905 he swept southwards along the main plateau, taking one Turkish garrison town after another in quick succession. It was then that he firmly established his influence and prestige in Badan. which is a large and mountainous district impinging on Yerim, Ibb and Qatabeh and dominating the routes between those towns. Its inhabitants are warlike and united ; they are in a position to give the Turks a good deal of trouble. Seif ul-Islam is also connected by marriage with the Sheikhs of the Ban a valley, near Saddah. (A Sherif, Seyyid or Imam may marry a woman of non-Fatimite descent, but the converse is sacrilege.) He came down to Aden some six years ago to arrange for the transport of the Imam’s minting-machine to Sheharah, wherey he has also established a munitions factory and repairino’-shons for small-arms. Before the war his name was generally mentioned among Ashraf and Sadah as the next Imam, and Yemen Sadah in Cairo, who are unaware of the trend of events, still consider his succession a certainty. It will be seen that the coalition between these tw 7 o men if genuine, is a strong one, for the candidate’s descent entitles him to serious consideration in a country that is practically ruled by a religious aristocracy, and Seif ul-lslam, besides being an energetic and dominant personality, is a prominent member of the collateral house. It is relevant to note that over and over again in the recent history of south-western Arabia some prominent and powerful personage has put fonvard the claims of a lesser personality to nominal dignities, while himself retaining the real power. One might quote the Ashars of Upper Yafa and the puppet Sultan of Loder as examples, but there are many others, for the office of “ kingmaker ” appeals to the shrewd Arabian statesman—he can use his protege as a political weather-vane and a lightning- conductor in case of storms ; for his owm pow 7 er and prestige need not suffer if he abandoned his candidate in good time—and there still remains his own claim to urge, or that of a more popular candidate. LIBYA. The Trospects of Mohammed Idris. It is still early to attempt a detailed enquiry into the effect upon the Cyrenaican situation of the agreement wdth Mohammed Idris described in Bulletin No. 50. There are indications, how r - ever, that affairs are shaping themselves along the expected lines and that Idris is beginning to exert an increasing influence amongst the Cyrenaican Sheikhs. He has now taken up his residence in the southern coastal district of Western Cyrenaica and is reported to be busily occupied in organizing the tribes of those parts against any 7 attempted eastward move on the part of Ramadan Sewehli. An instance of Idris’ growing prestige and authority may be cited in the recent secession of Safi ed-Din from his brother Seyyid Ahmed and his definite adherence to his cousin. As a concrete fact, this is a valuable indication of the undoubtedly prevalent trend of popular religious opinion amongst the followers of the Senussi tenets in these parts. In fact, it is now highly improbable that, even if he attempted to do so, Seyyid Ahmed could ever again attain to the leadership of the Senussi sect except, perhaps, by resorting to purely fanatical propaganda in direct opposition to the temperate and reasonable jurisdiction of Idris.Such a course might be expected to meet w ith a certain amount of popularity of a local nature and it is a contingency which Nuri has probably had well in mind m his repeated endeavours to restore to Sevyid Ahmed some measure of Ins shattered reputation by promises, gifts and flattery Meanwhile it is strongly rumoured from the oasis district, immediately south of the Gulf of Sert (where Seyyid Ahmed is at present to be found) that the ancient hostility between Ramadan and Seyyid Ahmed has been set aside and that Nuri has brought about a reconciliation between them. It may be inferred, however, from what is known of the respective characters of the two protagonists, that mutual distrust and dislike will not readily be patched up by any mere agreement or understanding negotiated by a third party, whom both probably regard as an outsider. However, it may well be questioned what benefit Ramadan is likely to reap from entering into partnership with one who, whether from a political, religious, or military point of view, can only be considered as bankrupt. It will be well, therefore, to await some more tangible manifestation of co-operation between these two old enemies before recording a definite success for Nuri There are no signs that Idris is not able to hold his own in Cyrenaica and, in this respect, the situation may be considered as satisfactory. Had there been any pronounced reluctance on the part of the tribes of Cyrenaica to accept Idris as the hereditary chieftain of the Senussi faith, it is safe to assume that by now such reluctance would have taken active shape. On the contrary, however, all reports point to ready consent on the part of these tribes, many of which have sent delegates to pav personal homage to their religions leader. The only menace, therefore, to the general satisfactory state of affairs in Cyrenaica seems to be Ramadan and what he intends to do with his reported well-equipped and numerous army, of which the main body, estimated at four to live thousand, is now encamped at Misurata on the eastern coast of Tripoli. In estimating Ramadan’s chances, should he succeed in over coming the well-known reluctance of his followers to leave their own country and advance east under his leadership, it must be remembered that such a move would immediately expose his present stronghold to attack by the Italians. Further, the Senussi of the Sert district number amongst them many trusty adherents of Idris who would vigorously oppose, as indeed they have already done, any intrusion on Ramadan’s part. Idris’ personal presence in the Gedabia district, too, would tend to stiffen their resistance as, though not now in actual touch, it would not be difficult for him to hurry west and assume control in Sert. All things being considered, then, the chances would seem to be against any eastward move on the part of Ramadan, but, at the same time, the fact should not be overlooked that, sooner or later,— 329 — 1 % iny nt K ii'toii lisonii tisiWas ice on I Wk it k m Ramadan will certainly be strongly pressed to make some return tor lurco-German “ services rendered,” and that he will have to make up his mind to move in one direction or the other. • Whether this will he an altogether voluntary move or not is another matter that remains to be seen. NOTES. The Situation at Qatif. I he following information has been supplied to the Political Agent at Bahrein by Dr. Harrison, an American Mission doctor, who returned on May 8 from a long visit to Qatif :— The population is entirely Shiah, with the exception of Ibn Sand’s officials and their retainers, some 200 in all. “ The Amir of Qatif, Abdurrahman ibn Abdullah as Suwailim, is a sound man, devoted to Ibn Sand’s interests, and, as neither he nor his adherents extort money from, or otherwise oppress, the inhabitants to any extent, he is well liked and there is no Shiah-Sunni friction. “All Ibn Sand’s officials are strongly pro-British, even when speaking in a hostile assembly. The inhabitants of Qatif were very pro-German, and probably are still in their innermost thoughts, but, as the result of the fall of Baghdad and the vigorous spreading abroad of Allied war-news, British prestige is now as high as it was before the war. The regular receipt of official news, telegrams and extracts from Reuter’s is much appreciated. “ The people are much exercised in their minds as to why, after a longish occupation of Iraq, we do not open up the pilgrim routes, and are inclined to think that we are purposely preventing pilgrims from going to the Holy Places without reason. The issue of a notification that the several pilgrim routes will be opened as soon as possible is strongly recommended, as also that the shrines at Samarra are safe. “ People are all strongly anti-Russian, and evince con siderable curiosity as to the situation in Russia. They look upon the entry of the United States of America into the war as an additional proof of the righteousness of the Allied cause.” Ibn Saud. In consequence of Sherif Abdullah’s remarks about Ibn Sand in his letter to his father {see p. 314 above) and reports from other sources that King Hussein was taking up an unsympathetic attitude towards ibn Saud and the Idrisi, Colonel Wilson took the opportunity during a recent interview to speak of these chiefs, in complimentary terms, and to remind the King of our treaty obligations towards them, and of the policy which His Majesty’s Government had pursued from'fSJU-aa-ir- - — — s:iO tlle beaming of the war. The reply of the King was quite t 5 ' ^ r 1 xj p stated that he had every intention ot adherin'’ to his promise of non-interference with the affairs of Ibn Sand and the Idrisi but that he preferred to wa,t tmt.l the Turks had been finally expelled from the He™ before l a li ne with internal Arabian politics He would then he guided entirely by the wishes of His Majesty s Government. Ibn Sand has kept the King ndonned of his peace negotiations with Ibn Kashid After they had faded owmg to \hn Thishid’s refusal to ally himself with the British and the King: of the Hejaz (see p. 269 above), Saleh ibn Athl, who had been Ibn Baud’s envoy to Hail, was sent to Mecca to make a full report to the King. This action on the part of Ibn Baud bears out the impression gained from the letters on the subject which have been received by Sir Percy Cox, and which he describes as straightforward, uncompromising and entirely loyal to the King and ourselves. Sherif Abdullah, it seems, was influenced, in writing as he did, by the intrigues of one Ibn Dakhdivi, who has since been cast into prison at Mecca. Ibn Baud, in a recent friendly letter to the King, makes no mention of his intention to make the pilgrimage, but his father-the Imam Abdurrahman who wrote at the same time—asked whether there would be any objection to bis coming himself. It is understood that the King will encourage his doing so. Capture of Teima. It is reported that Teima has been taken by the local Sheikh, who is, presumably, of the \\ ulud Suleiman, on behalf of the King of the Hejaz. Ibn Hash id’s representative was killed, and fifty Turkish prisoners captured. Teima, which lies about seventy- five miles due east of Moadhdham, is on the main roads from the north and west to Hail, and its capture should seriously interfere with communica tions between Ibn Rashid and the Turks. The Shammar are said to be exerting pressure on Ibn Rashid to make peace with the King of the Hejaz, and to have threatened to take matters into their own hands in the event of his refusal. Arabs at Kabul. It is reported from Kabul that some Arabs (professional beggars who visit Afghanistan annually), have, contrary to the old practice, been ill-treated and abused by the Turkophile element here, among whom the most prominent are Mahmud Tarzi, Naib-us-Saltanat, and Mustaufi Mirza Mohammed Husain. These Arabs were persecuted for no fault of their own but merely because their nation had thrown off the yoke of Turkish rule, which was, according to their persecutors, heresy and sedition on the part of the Arabs as a nation. Yemen News. A rumour is current at Lahej that terms of peace are being discussed between Ilias Bey of Ibb and the followers of the late Negib Hassan Abu Ras (see p. 304).o3o i fjj. ^ /k. 4 ARABIA. The Sherif s Religious Views. On July 28, 1917, the Sherif of Mecca explained at some length to Colonel Wilson before me his dogmatic position He began by sketching the original tenets of the Wahabi sect—its pmitanism, its literalism and its asceticism. After the Egyptian conquest of ISiejd the sect fell away very quickly in numbers and enthusiasm, till of late years it was practically confined to Aridh. I he Nomads, \\ ushm and Qasim had all weakened so much as to be practically Sunni. About four years ago there was a sudden revival. The Sherif is doubtful as to whether this can be ascribed to Ibn Sand or not. At any rate, funds were obtained from some where, and A ahabite missionaries went up to Qasim, amongst the Ateiba, Meteir and Sbei, and into Mecca and Taif. The first tenet of the new preachers was that the orthodox Sunnis and Shias (especially the Shias), were infidels. The Emir of Mecca was as convicted a Kafir as the Turks. The constructive side of the new creed was curious ; they preached an exaggerated fatalism : “ God does everything ; ” they forbade medicine to the sick, discouraged trade, building and forethought. A favourite saying was, “ If a man fall into a well, leave it to God to pull him out.” The missionaries were at first successful in great part, and the Sherif took alarm at the prospect. He sent Sidi Abdullah rapidly into Nejd, and by a show of force recovered the Ateiba, and most of the Meteir, and bound them again to the Emirate of Mecca. He also seems to have taken steps to counter-preach the new dogmas in Qasim itself, and in a short time the second Wahabite movement appeared to have spent itself. It was, however, only dormant, and in the last year or so missionaries have again been issuing from Aridh, and agitating the neighbourhood. Ibn Saud has increased the unrest by his military policy. He has called out his levies two and three times in the year, discriminating between town and town ; from one he will demand a contribution of men ; and from another a composition in money. This has particularly annoyed Aneyza, Boreyda and Russ, rich and comfortable towns, fond of silk and tobacco, and not too fond of prayer. Their disaffection is wide, and the Sherif regards it as an embarrassment, since his ambitions extend to the limits of the Ateiba and Meteir only, and he has no desire to be involved in any question of the suzerainty of the Qasim towns. At present there is a sharp cleavage between Aridh and Qasim, which any external encouragement, or un wise internal act, might inflame into an open breach. We then asked the Sherif about the position of the Shias. Towards the Wahabis, he said, they were extremely hostile. Other than that, he could not see in them any particular policy.•p, l,w«1 his family, since Shias have a greater respect for the — of the Prophet than have the Sunms. borne such as the eb-, tbs “i SH&amp;trASS: !»«.»' il. - doctrinal. He in common with all orthodox Islam was not prepared to deny the Khalifate of Abu Bekr, and regarded the Sh.as who condemned Abu Bekr, Omar and Othman, as nnstaken. The Shias in India are largely heretical m their views, as are many of the Persian sects. (The Sherif is ostensibly a Shafei. In this conversation he took up a middle position between moderate Shia and Sunni ; it is oenerally believed that his real beliefs are /eidi. Sidi Abdullah is* nearly openly a bhia of the Jaafen wing; Sidi Vli is a Sunni, and a fairly definite one ; Sidi beisal is not a formalist, and tends to an undefined imdogmatic position, ‘more Shia perhaps than Sunni, but vague. I hey are all nervous of betraying their real attitude, even to their friends, and I then mentioned to the Sherif that the Northern Arabs commonly called him Emir el-Muminin, and asked him if this title was correct and if it met with his approval. After a short reflection he said “ No ” and made his refusal more definite later. He said that people ascribed to him ambitions which he did not possess ; he had even heard talk of his reviving the Khalifate. He explained his position with regard to the Khalifate. It was the simple Shia one (already impressed on me by Feisal and Abdullah), namely, that the Khalifate expired with Abu Bekr, and that any resurrection of the idea to-day was not only grammatically absurd but blasphemous. He will have absolutely no truck with such a notion. (Sidi Abdullah is weaker than his father in this respect. If he saw profit from the Sunni side in the assumption, he might do it, and cut the loss of the Shia element; }et, as matters stand, if the decision lies with him it is improbable that it will ever be adopted.) The idea of a Moslem Khalifate was, said the Sherif, suggested to Abdul Hamid by the British, and exploited by him as a stivk to beat us with. Its exponents to-day were Obeidullah, Abd el-Aziz Shawish, Shekib Arslan, and Assad Shucair, four blackguards without an ounce of Islam or honesty between them, and its nominal holder, the Sultan of the Turks, was a pitable laughing-stock ; the invention had been fatal to Islam ; it*tried to twist a religion into a political theory and was responsible for unrest in Turkey, Arabia, Egypt, North Africa, Java, India and China. It had plunged Turkey into the present war, and caused the Arab revolt, and with this example before his eyes, and in view of his own policy of friendship with Great Britain, he could neither acknowledge another’s Khalifate, assume one himself, or admit the existence of the theory. Idle title Emir el-Muminin was one that a sincere Moslem might adopt. It made no pretence to any succession to theprophet^ but was objectionable politically, on account of the word a Emir. I t was no use being Emir, without the power or pre tence of giving orders, not to a sect, or a country or two, but to the Moslem world. 1 he main divisions of Shia and Sunni would unite under this title, but the smaller sects, and especially the alien congregations in India and Africa, would resent the impli cation of authority, as, no doubt, would the Great Powers. His policy for Islam was to provide in Mecca and Medina for the honourable upkeep of the Holy Places, to facilitate the ] pilgrimage, and to issue Fetwas and Sheria decisions as required. The Moslem world must have a head, but it would be a less tem pestuous body of thought if the head was the Sherif and Emir of Mecca, basing his right on the concrete possession of the Holy Places, and on an authentic descent, not on a supposed implicit apostolic authority, inherited from an unbroken succession of Khalifas. His motives in rebelling against the Turks were two. The first is a political object ; the liberation of the Arab world from Turkish domination ; this he will effect without question of creed ; Christian, Druse, Shia and Sunni meet on a common base of nationality, and must co-operate with him on level terms if the aim is to be achieved. His second motive was a religious one, purely Islamic in character ; it is to provide for the Mohammedan world an independant sovereign, ruling in the Holy Places, of the Sherifian family, whose claims to the spiritual leadership of Islam will be so transcendent as to be generally admitted, but whose weakness in material resources (money, ships, and guns) will at once make him acceptable to the Christian Powers, and purge Islam of the lunatic idea that it is a polity, bound tempo rally to a single infallible head. His ideal is a spiritual city, not a theocracy. To attain this aim he must have temporalities enough, free of foreign control, to establish his claim to political competence, and must be delivered from the hierarchical theories which have plunged Turkey, the Senussi and Ali Dinar into suicidal jehads. His temporalities he will hold as King of the Arab countries, and his spiritualities as Emir of Mecca. My personal opinion is that the title of Emir el-Muminin would not be repugnant to him, if it came not as his assumption but as the homage of his followers. It is generally used by the tribes to day from Kaf to Kunfida, and will apparently be accept able to the Sheikhs of urban Syria. His present objection, that it involves the power of command in Islam, does not hold good, since it is as fair to interpret it only in a doctrinal sense. As for the Khali fate, the sincere disgust he expressed of Abdul Hamid’s bogus claims, and his only half-veiled acknowledg ment of Shia tenets himself, made me certain that this opposition to the idea is a matter of principle. Further, I do not think that all the temptations of the world would persuade Sherif Hussein to run Counter to his principles. His transparent honesty and strength of conviction (while they may prevent him distin cruishing between his prejudices and his principles) will at all O C 5 Acosts ensure his shaping his conduct exactly ... accordance with Ms promised word. It would be easy to influence him in coming to a decision, but once his mind is made up it would be a thank- less task to tr} T and make him change it. He appears to hope that, by ignoring the political disinte- oration of Islam, he may be able to concentrate attention on its dogmatic differences and do something to reduce the friction between sects. His appeal would be to moderate Sunni and moderate Shia to meet together under Ins presidency, and try to restrain the extremists in their camps. T 1? I The Occupation of Akaba. The following account by Captain Lawrence supplements information already given on pages 307-308 above. The irregularity of the Hejaz mail service is responsible for the delay in its publication :— By Monday, June 18, we had enrolled 535 Toweiha (of whom twenty-five were horsemen), about 150 Rualla (under Benaiah ibn ' Dnghmi, Durzi’s brother) and Sherarat (under Geraitan el-Azmi), and thirty-five Kawachiba, under Dhami. Of these we chose nearly 200, and left them as guards for the tribal tents in Wadi Sirhan. With the rest we marched out of Kaf in the afternoon, and on June 20 entered Bair, after an easy but waterless march over the Suwan. At Bair we found one well filled in, two seriously damaged, and a fourth unhurt : the Turks had come there a little time before with Hamd el-Arar, and tried to blow them in with gelignite. They used an electric exploder clumsily, and we removed many tamped charges rrom the sides of the still open wells. Circumstances forced us to stay in Bair till Thursday June 28. The time was spent in negotiations with Ibn Jazi and the smaller sub-sections of the Howeitat on the Akaba road. We also carried out demolitions against the railway at Atwi, Sultani, Minifir, and elsewhere. The Ageyl dynamitards were inefficient, and our supply of dynamite small, so that the demolitions were of a pin-prick character, meant only to distract the Turks, and advertise our coming to the Arabs. The staffs ol two stations were killed, to the same intent. From Bair we marched to El-Jefer, where we stayed till July 1. The Turks had been more successful in their efforts against the wells here, and we had some difficulty in digging one out. 1 he water proved sufficient for about 300 men and camels, when it was obtained. The station buildings of Maan and Hamra are visible from El-Jefer, about twenty-four milesoff,^ but the Turks did not realise chat we had arrived in force owing to the operations near Amman, undertaken at this time by a flying column of 100 men, under Sheikh Zaal. This led them to believe us still in Wadi Sirhan, and on the 30th they sent a force of 400 cavalry with four machine guns, and Nawaf ibn Shaalan as guide, from Derail to go to Kaf and find us. the Turks seem unable to discriminate the true from the false out of the flood of news unquestionably brought them by the local Arabs. From El-defer a hying column rode to Fuweilah, about seventeen miles south-west of Maan, and in concert with the Dhumaniya Howeitat (Sheikh Gasim) attacked the gendarme post on the motor road to Akaba. In the fighting some mounted gendarmes got into a group of undefended Howeitat tents, and stabbed to death an old man, six women and seven children, the only occupants. Our Arabs in consequence wiped out the post, but not before some had escaped to Maan. This news reached Maan at dawn on the 1st, and a battalion of the 178th Regiment which had arrived at Maan from Zungul- dak on the day before, was immediately ordered out to Fuweilah to relieve the post. The same afternoon we descended on the line at kilometre 479, near Ghadir el Haj, and carried out exten sive demolitions till nearly sunset, when we marched westward, intending to sleep at Batra. On the way, however, we were met by messengers from our Fuweilah column, reporting the coming of new troops from Maan, and we swung northwards, marching a great part of the night, till we were able at dawn to occupy the crests of the low rolling grass-covered hills that flank each side of the Akaba road near Ain Aba el-Bissau. The Turks had reached Fuweilah, to find only vultures in possession, and moved to Aba el-Lissan, fourteen miles from Maan, for the night. The spring has been built round, and piped, and is much smaller than it used to be before the war, but is still sufficient for perhaps 2,000 men and animals. The battalion camped next the water, and kept together in the bottom of the valley, so that we were able to take the higher ground (at from 400 to 600 yards range) without difficulty. We sat here throughout duly 2, sniping the Turks steadily all day, and inflicted some loss. The Turks replied with shrapnel from a mountain gun, firing twenty rounds, which were all they had. The shells grazed our hill-tops, and burst far away over the valleys behind. When sunset came, Auda Abu Tayi collected the fifty horsemen now with us, in a hollow valley about 200 yards from the Turks, but under cover, and suddenly charged at a wild gallop into the brown of them, shooting furiously from the saddle as he came. The' unexpectedness of the move seemed to strike panic into the Turks (about 550 strong), and after a burst of rifle fire, they scattered in all directions, 't his was our signal, and all the rest of our force (perhaps 350 men, for some were watching the road on the east) dashed down the hillsides into the hollow,— 338 — as fast as the camels would go. The Turks were all infantry, and the Arabs all mounted, and the nux-up round the spring m the dusk with 1 000 uieii shooting like mad, was considerable. As the Turks scattered, their position at once became hopeless, and in five minutes it was merely a massacre. In all 1 counted 300 enemy dead in the main position, and a few fugitives may have been killed further away, though the majority of our men went straight for the Turkish camp to plunder it, before the last shots were fired. The prisoners came to 100 (three officers), mostly taken by Sherif Nasir and myself, since the Arabs in the Maan area are very bitter against the Turks, and are set on killing •dl they can. They have some reason for this attitude, in the slaughter of the women and children mentioned above, and in the previous execution of Sheikh Abd el-Rahman, a Belgawiya from Kerak. He was popular, and anti-Turk, but the Government caught him, and harnessing him between four wild mules tore hi m to death. This was the culmination of a series of executions by torture in Kerak, and the memory of them has embittered The Arab losses in the fight came to two killed (a Rualla and a Sherarat) and several wounded, including Sheikh Benaiah ibn Dughmi. Considering the amount of firing, the confusion, the close quarters at which we were, and the Turkish casualties, the Arabs must be held to have got off very luckily. Several horses were hit in the cavalry charge, and Auda himself (in front, of course) had a narrow escape, since two bullets smashed his field glasses, one pierced his revolver holster, three struck his sheathed sword,and his horse was killed under him. He was wildly pleased with the whole affair. Unfortunately, many of our prisoners were wounded and we had very few spare camels with us. Those who could hold on were mounted behind Arabs on the spare camels ; but we had to abandon the worst cases at Aba el-Lissan, and of those we took with us about fifty died of heat, hunger and thirst on the road down to Akaba. The heat in the Hesma and Wadi Itm was terrible, and the water between Fuweilah and Akaba only sufficient for perhaps 200 men and animals. For the matter of food, Nash* and 1 had taken two months’ supply with us from Wejh, and were now two months out; the Bedu had their own food with them in their saddle bags, but Arab rations are ill-adapted, in quality and quantity, for Turkish soldiers. We did what we could for the prisoners, but everybody went short. From Aba el-Lissan we marched to Guweira (22 miles) after sending out a column which destroyed Mreiga, the nearest gendarme post to Maan, on the Akaba road. At Guweira we received the surrender of the garrison (of about 120 men), their intermediary being Hussein ibn dad, who joined us here on July 4. The motor road is finished to the foot of Aagb el-Star, from Maan, but not metalled anywhere. As the soil is fairly hard loam, I think it should suffice for thepassage of a series of light cars. The Nagb is very steep, with bad hairpin corners, and will require improvement. The Hesma is of hue red sand, soft along the track, but harder in the bed of the watercourse which runs down from the foot of the Nagb to Guweira. FromGuweira we marched down Wadi Itm to Kethira (18 miles) where we overran a Turkish post of about seventy infantry and fifty mounted men, taking most of them prisoners, and thence we went on to near Khadra, at the old stone dam in Wadi Itm (15 miles), where we came into contact with the garrison (300 men) of Akaba. They had retired here from the village itself (about six miles away) to be out of view of the sea, and on the line of retreat towards Maan. The news of our fight at Fuweilah had reached Akaba quickly, and all the Amran, Darausha, Heivvat and sub-tribes of the Howeitat near Akaba had risen, and collected round the Khadra post, which had held them at bay from their trenches with small casualties for two days. When Nash’ and the banner turned up the Arab excitement became intense, and preparations were made for an immediate assault. This did not fall in with our ideas, since (pour encou- rqc/er les autres) we wanted the news to get about that the Arabs accepted prisoners. All the Turks we met were most happy to surrender, holding up their arms and crying “Muslim, Muslim” as soon as they saw us. They expressed themselves willing and anxious to go on fighting foreigners and Christians till they dropped, but with no intention of adding a Moslem enemy to the powers already against them. To save the Khadra garrison from massacre Sherif Nasir had to labour from after noon till dawn, but he eventually carried his point (by our going ourselves between the Arab and the Turkish lines, to break their field of fire), and with the prisoners (now about 600 in number) we marched into Akaba on the morning of July 6. The asto nishment of a German N.C.O. (well-boring at Khadra) when the Sherif’s force appeared was comic. He knew neither Arabic nor Turkish, and had not been aware of the Arab revolt. The situation at Akaba was now rather serious, economically. We had no food, 600 prisoners and many visitors in prospect. Meat was plentiful, since we had been killing riding camels as required, and there were unripe dates in the palm groves. These saved the day, but involved a good deal of dis comfort after the eating, and the force in Akaba was very unhappy till the arrival of H.M.S. “ Dufferin ” on the loth with food from Suez. Before she arrived, Arab forces were sent northward to occupy the hills up to Wadi Musa (Petra), some sixty miles from Akaba, and southward to join up with the Beni Atiyeh, and reconnoitre the country with a view to an eventunl offensive against the railway south of Maan.— 340 NOTES. Abyssinian News. The Bit waded, Haili Giorgis (p.lo2), was arrested mid chained on July 11, by order of the Empress and Has I altar., m.d instructions issued to seize all his property. Iron, an early hour the Ghebbi was filled with troops, and the Utwaded was then’ summoned to attend the council, and, on his refusing to come on the plea of ill-health, Has Demissie was sent with a stroim force to bring him. The arrest was made without any Relations between Has Taffari and Haili Giorgis have been strained since the Revolution. For eight years, the Bitwaded, thanks to his undoubted intelligence, had held the _ reins of government in his own hand, which meant complete liberty to further his own financial interests, and he had evidently determined to make his support of the new government conditional on his being allowed to retain his power. To. this Ras Taffari would not consent, and not only declined to bring him in to his intimate councils .but deprived him first-of the eontrollership of the railway, and then of the governorship of the market. It was the Bit waded’s refusal to hand over this offer to his successor that furnished the ostensible reason for his arrest. The real reasons were no doubt his opposition to the assumption of authority by Ras Taffari, and the suspicion, under which he has recently fallen, of communicating with Lij Yasu. The general result of this incident is likely to be satisfactory It is the first trial of strength between Ras Taffari and his ministers, and the fact that he has been able to crush the Bitwaded will raise his prestige with a people who despise weakness. A telegram from Adis Abeba, dated July 30, reports that a part of Lij Yasu’s force has left Magdala and occupied the capital of Edju. Lij Yasu has left a garrison at Magdala, but his own where abouts are not stated. There is no news of the movements of the Government troops who were surrounding Magdala (p. 295), but they have presumably abandoned the siege and dispersed. Ras Hailu of Gojjam (p. 316), during his recent visit to Adis Abeba, is reported to have strongly advised the Government to put an end to German and Turkish intrigues in Abyssinia. The Ansariyah. The following additional information has been received about the Ansariyah {see Nos. 54 and 56 of the Bulletin) :— I he most important tribes among these people are the Mhelba and the Kalbieh. The chief of the former is Khair Bey, a man of forty-eight years, who lives at Kalaat el-Mhelba. TheGovernment made him chief of the Ansariyah volunteers, and he has under his control various other tribes such as Hamarra, Darussi, Beit el-Lenar, Beni Ah, Beit Yashuta, Beit el-Hadad, Metaura, Beit el-khayat and the inhabitants of the Latakiya Plain, xie is reputed to be an Anglophile and to have been on good terms with the British Consular Ag6nt before the war. The second most important individual in the tribe is his cousin, Shakir Derwish Aga Khair Beg, who is about fifty-five years old and lives at El-Fakura. The Mhelba with their subordinate tribes number about 4,000 males, of whom about 150 or 200 are armed, mostly with Greek Gras rifles, and are excellent shots. Their sympathies, like those of the Kalbieh, are said to lie with the rich and the strong ; but especially with the rich, among whom they reckon the British and the French. The Kalbieh are reported to be able to put 2,000 men into the field, of whom a few are armed with Mausers, and are a more efficient fighting force than the Mhelba. Their chief is Aziz Ismail, who also controls the people of'Karahla, Nuasra, Rashauna, Jalkish, Jehni and Beit Mohammed. Abdullah Ibn Dakhil. In the last Bulletin (p. 330) we referred to the intrigues of a certain Ibn Dakhdivi in connection with the relations between King Husein and Ibn Sand. We are now informed that the real name of this man is Abdullah ibn Dakhil, one of the sheikhs of Russ, in Qasim, and that he was formerly an envoy from Sherif Feisal to Nuri Shaalan and Ibn Rashid. He recently left Wejh, having made himself highly unpopular there as commander of the Ageyl, and was sent to Mecca, where he had nothing to do. Soon after this the King received the letter {see p. 314) in which Sherif Abdullah mentioned Ibn Sand’s intention of making the pilgrimage, and advised the King not to allow him to do so. This letter was followed immediately by a letter from Sherif Feisal, giving the same information and the same advice. Feisal added that he had received the information in a letter from Ibn Dakhil at Mecca, and there is little doubt that Abdullah’s informant was the same. The story, as presented to Feisal, not unnaturally aroused his suspicious. It was, according to King Husein’s statement to Colonel Wilson, that Ibn Saud had sent messengers to his agents and friends in Mecca and Jeddah, ask ing them what his reception would be if he came to Mecca at the forthcoming pilgrimage season, and that the answers were that he should come with his men and that he would find m) force in Southern Hejaz to interfere in any way with his liberty of action. The King, as soon as he received Feisal’s letter, sent for Ibn Dakhil and asked for an explanation. Ibn Dakhil replied that he had sent no such letter to Feisal. The King said that he preferred to take Feisal’s word for that, and threw Ibn Dakhil into prison.— 842 — Capture of Teirna. The capture of Teima by the local Anazeh, reported on ^ oo a likelv to lead to their more eftective co-operation with the She, if. ' They recently held up a caravan from Hail, 'Listing- of artillery, troops and supplies but not being in sufficient strength to attack, they merely demanded and were triven forty rifles. The Turks are believed to be senousy alarmed at the prospect of Teima being used as a base tor attacks on the railway, and may be expected to make a determined attempt to recapture it and cnast.se the Anazeh. he Turkish officers at Hail are reported to be short of cash, as Ibn Rashid’s Grandmother, who has pro-British sympathies, holds the nurse 0 striiia:s and refuses to provide him with funds. Hejaz Intelligence. The Akaba situation shows little development. The Turkish force that occupied Fuweilah (strength about two battalions with some hundreds of mounted men) has not attempted any forward move. As far as Aba el - Lissan and F u weilah, the road from Maan to Akaba runs over open rolling country, affording little oppor tunity for the exercise of Arab tactics, and the water supply at Aba el-Lissan is enough for perhaps 5,000 men. After Fuweilah the road descends the steep Nag'b el-Star (dropping nearly 2,000 feet in a zigzag road of about four miles) and then runs over the sandy plain of°El-Eisma, which is studded with precipitous rock- pinnacles of red sandstone. Behind one of these, at Gfuweira (twenty miles from Fuweilah) are the present headquarters of Auda Abu Tayi, who has about 600 Howeitat with him. The waterat Guweira lies in two side valleys to the north, and is sufficient for about 2,000 men, but difficult of access. After Guweira the Akaba road runs up a broad valley to a watershed, and then runs for twenty miles through the gorge of Wadi Itm, a watercourse from forty to 300 yards wide, with cliff sides 300 to 3,000 feet high serrated and broken in the wildest way. The bed is rough underfoot, turns and twists through the hills, and has no water supply in it, though weak springs exist in side ravines, from one to three miles off the road. The Arab tactics are to allow the l urks to advance to Guweira and beyond, sniping them when possible, and cutting off patrols and supply caravans. In Wadi Itm itself they would hold all the water sources strongly and occupy the hills each side of the main valley. The Turkish problem is to carry enough water from Aba el-Lissan to Akaba (fifty-five miles) to support the relatively con siderable body of troops necessary to force Wadi Itm, and maintain itself before Akaba, where the wells, being all under machine gun fire from the sea, cannot be relied on as available for an attacking force. A hurried Turkish advance on Akaba is therefore hardly to be looked for, as it is impossible unless the Turks can persuade a sufficient number of the Sherifian Arabs to cease fighting, andgather quantities of camels from the Turcophil Arabs. They have made efforts m both directions, but so far without much success. Auda Abu Layi remains unshakeably Arab, and he commands a following so long as he remains in the field. He has lately sent Mohammed el-Dheilan to near Ghadir el-Haj (a bridge and about foity rails cut), Auda ibu Zaal to near Batn el-Ghul (two bridges blown up), and Zaal ibn Motlog to Aneze (a bridge destroyed). These laids were to distract the Lurkish attention from the Fuweilah district, and something on a larger scale will be attempted as^ soon as more materials are available. A compound Garland mine at Atwi shattered the firebox of the leading locomotive, and overturned the second, of a double-engined train. L urkish aeroplanes have made many short flights over Auda’s forces (inflicting one casualty and causing panics) but have not been able to visit Akaba again. Further details have been received about the attacks on the railway reported iu the last Bulletin. On July 28, Sherif Feisal’s force destroyed 1,000 rails between Bedai and Bir Gedid. At Sell Matara Sherif Sharraf captured fifty prisoners, including three officers. On July 31, Jaafar Pasha’s force had a twelve hours’ fight with the Turks at Zumrud, where the Egyptians occupied a fort two miles from the station for some days. The result of the fighting was indecisive, but the Turks were driven back and lost about fifty killed and wounded and fifty prisoners. The Egyptians had two wounded and two captured, and the Arabs about fifty killed and wounded. Between Hedieand Muderij a party under Major Joyce and a Sherif destroyed over 700 rails (four kilometres) on July 27 ; the enemy attacked from each station but were held off until the demolition was complete. Another raid by Sherif Abdullah’s forces was carried out on August 2 between Toweira and Wayban, where about 1,400 charges were exploded and about six kilometres of railroad, includ ing seven culverts, were thoroughly demolished. In an engagement near Toweira the Arabs lost one man killed and claim to have killed thirty-three Turks. Both of these raids were carried out by day. Emir Feisal, a Sheikh of the Jerba Shammar, has arrived at Mecca with thirty-five followers and offered his services to the Sherif. The latter is arranging for him to return shortly to Mesopotamia and has recommended him to visit the G.O.C., Baghdad, with a view to assisting the operations of the British on the Tigris.SECRET.

W e have now latter s relations n i c nt 0 f this interview, written by received from him , t . The Sherif, after explaining Captam Lawrence who wasjesen ^ lagt , l 5u llcti,r, '» = »“ ll) !‘ *!f fr ~B 1“ Ld been friendly, and he l.ad no mtention of giving offence in the manner suggested by Sidi Abdullah On the contrary, he had invited Abd el-Rahman Ibn baud s father to come to Mecca for the Haj, and to reconcile with Ibn S md such fugitives of the Emir’s family as had taken refuge with him in Mecca. He hopes to hear in a few days that Abd el- Rahman is coming. The Sherif also said that Sidi Abdullah was on the best of terms with Ibn Sand, and insisted that he went to Shaara in 1914-1915 to assist Ibn Saud against Ibn Rashid. He also said that Abdullah’s presence there bail prevented Ibn Rashid from following up the victory at Jerab. I his is also Sidy Abdullah s present view of his* action on that occasion, and it is worth notincr 'from Captain Shakespear’s reports before the battle (Arab Bulletin, 1916, p. 336), that Abdullah and Ibn Saud were in direct relation at that time. Colonel Wilson suggested to the Sherif that it might be desirable to send letters officially to Idrisi and Ibn Saud, mfoiming them that his assumption of the Royal title was not intended in juiy way to suggest interference with their internal affairs, and proposing common action against the 1 urks. He suggested that if Said Mustafa and Tnrki could come to Mecca as representatives of Idrisi and Ibn Saud, the relations of the three rulers could be put on a satisfactory basis. The Sherif said he did not agree with him. He thought it unwise to raise the question of the inter-relations of the Emirates of Arabia while the Turks were still in possession of the Hejaz. His future policy towards the other Emirs would be guided, when the time came, by the wishes of the British Government. For the present he intends to make no demand, suggestion, or protest to them, in any event. He did not believe they could harm him, even if they wanted to, and as for their co-operation with him against the Turks, they all had cause enough against the I urks, and treaties with the British Government, and if that did not move them, he was not going to try. Later he said that Idrisi’s promise of neutrality to Muhied- din in Asir had enabled the Turks to operate against the Beni Shihir, who had however repulsed them and inflicted a loss of twenty-five killed on them. He said that Ibn Sand’s conducttowards Fbu Rashid was a disappointment, especially his recent retirement from Northern Qasim. He had asked Salih ibn Athil for the reason for the latter move, and Salih had replied that he was not in a position to explain it. He mentioned that Ibn Sand had permitted the Turkish military envoys, with specie for the Yemen force, to pass through his country, on payment of £10,000, and expressed some disgust at the meanness which would break a treaty obligation for so small a bribe. He also said that the ruling family of Koweit was neg roid^and that Mohammerah, as Persian, was hardly in a posi tion to enter an Arab Confederation. The Sherif mentioned later that the Ajman who had turned on Ibn Sand and killed his brother were now serving Sidi Zeid and Sidi Abdullah. He had no intention of making capital out of them ; but he hoped, through Abd el-Rahman, to persuade Ibn Saud to make peace with them. When asked what his ideas were with regard to Ibn Rashid, he promptly said that Ibn Rashid was a young fool with no will or policy of his own. The visit of Ibn Ajil to Abdullah, the defeat of Rashaid Ibn Leila by Zeid (see p. 316), and the inter view between Ibn Rimmal and Sherif Nasir were then quoted as possible indications of an early submission of the Shammar to his authority, and he was asked what his attitude towards proposals of peace would be. He replied that when the time came, he would consult with Colonel Wilson and act in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. It was evident throughout the interview that the Sherif has no intention at all of adjusting the relations of the Hejaz Govern ment with the Emirs of Arabia until after the fall of Medina. He said quite frankly that they were not going to do him good or harm at present, and felt that his position would then be suffi ciently improved to give him the advantage in negotiation. He insisted at the same time upon his good personal relations with the various rulers, and seemed to anticipate no difficulty in arriv ing eventually at an agreement with them, agreeable to the wishes of the British Government. Twenty-seven Articles. The following notes have been expressed in commandment form for greater clarity and to save words. They are, however, only my personal conclusions, arrived at gradually while I worked in the Hejaz and now put on paper as stalking horses for beginners in the Arab armies. They are meant to apply only to Bedu ; townspeople or Syrians require totally different treatment. I ic\ are of course not. suitable to any other person s need, or applicable unchanged in any particular situation. Handling Hejaz Arabs is&gt;48 pxcei'tions and no obvious rules.

Be a little still a ‘ In matters of business deal only with the commander of the army, column, or party in which you serve. Never give orders ai all and reserve your directions or advice toi the C.O., Sg (f- efficiency’s sake) of dealing direct with his underlings. Your place is advisory and your dvice S due to the commander alone. Let him see that this s ^ur conception of your duty, and that his is to be the sole executive o£ your joint plans. i n c , 4 Win and keei) the confidence of your leader, strengthen his prestige at your expense before others when yon can. Never refuse or quash schemes he may put forward ; but ensure that they are put forward in the first instance privately to you. Always approve them, and after praise modify them insensibly, causing the suggestions to come from him, until they :ue m accord with your own opinion. When you attain this point, ho him to it, keep a tight grip of his ideas, and push him forward as firmly as possibly, hut secretly, so that no one but hnnselt (and he* not too clearly ) is aware of your pressure. 5. Remain in touch with your leader as constantly and unobtrusively as you can. Live with him, that at meal times and at audiences you may he naturally with him in his ten . Formal visits to give advice are not so good as the constant diop- ping of ideas in casual talk. When stranger sheikhs come m or the first time to swear allegiance and offer service, ^ clear out o the tent. If their first impression is of foreigners in the conn- dence of the Sherif, it will do the Arab cause much harm. (i. Be shy of too close relations with the subordinates of the expedition. Continual intercourse with them will make it impossible for you to avoid going behind or beyond the instruc tions that the Arab C.O., has given them on your advice, am m so disclosing the weakness of his position you altogether destro} vour own.7. Treat the sub-chiefs of your force quite easily and lightly. In this way you hold yourself above their level. Treat the leader, if a Sherif, with respect. He will return your manner and you and he will then be alike, and above the rest. Preced ence is a serious matter among the Arabs, and you must attain it. 8. Your ideal position is when you are present and not noticed. Do not be too intimate, too prominent, or too earnest. Avoid being identified too long or too often with any tribal sheikh, even if C.O. of the expedition. To do your work you must be above jealousies, and you lose prestige if you are asso ciated with a tribe or clan, and its inevitable feuds. Sherifs are above all blood-feuds and local rivalries, and form the only prin ciple of unity among the Arabs. Let your name therefore be coupled always with a Sherif’s, and share his attitude towards the tribes. When the moment comes for action put yourself publicly under his orders. The Bedu will then follow suit. 9. Magnify and develop the growing conception of the Sherifs as the natural aristocracy of the Arabs. Intertribal jea lousies make it impossible for any sheikh to attain a commanding position, and the only hope of union in nomad Arabia is that the Ashraf be universally acknowledged as the ruling class. Sherifs are half-townsmen, half-nomad, in manner and life, and have the instinct of command. Mere merit and money would be insufficient to obtain such recognition ; but the Arab reverence for pedigree and the Prophet gives hope for the ultimate success of the Ashraf. 10. Call your Sherif “ Sidi” in public and in private. _ Call other people by their ordinary names, without title. In intimate conversation call a Sheikh “ Abu Annad,” “ Akhu Alia” or some similar by-name. 11. The foreigner and Christian is not a popular person in Arabia. However friendly and informal the treatment of yourself may be, remember always that your foundations are very sandy ones. Wave a Sherif in front of you like a banner and hide your own mind and person. If you succeed, you will have hundreds of miles of country and thousands of men under your orders, and for this it is worth bartering the outward show. 12. Cling tight to your sense of humour. You will need it every day. A dry irony is the most useful type, and repaitee of a personal and not too broad character will double your influence with the chiefs. Reproof, if wrapped up in some smiling form, will carry further and last longer than tne most violent speech. The power of mimicry or parody is valuable, but use it sparingly, for wit is more dignified than humour. Do not cause a laugh at a Sherif except amongst Sherifs. 13. Never lay hands on an Arab ; you degrade yourself. You may think the resultant obvious increase of outward respect a gain to you ; but what you have really done is to build a wall between you and their inner selves. It is difficult to keep quiet350 you or anyone ^ ^ vou fl n a a t bottom their real fund of good- , . • i - a- done wroim', but the less you lose your when everything rs c, ”a v *intaoe Also then you will not go temper the greater your advantage. j b inad r r'tvhile very difficult to drive, the Bedu are easy to lead, .. 14 ,- * tit iritience to bear with them. 1 he less apparent ,£ you have th p. your influence. They are willing to your '“terteienc ^t w 1 mt you wish, but they do not mean follow to be aware of that. It is only after the end of all annoyances 15 Do not try to do too much with your own hands. IWter the Arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly. 1 1 L he r war, and you are to help them not to win it or them. Actually, also under the very odd conditions of Arabia, your practical work will not be as good as, perhaps, you think it is. 1 (t If you can, without being too lavish, forestall presents to vourself A well placed gift is often most effective in winning over a suspicious sheikh. Never receive a present without giving ‘i liberal return, but you may dekiy this return (while letting its ultimate certainty be known) if you require a particular service from the &lt;&gt;'iver. ' Do not let them ask yon for things, since their o-i-eed wilfthen make them look upon you only as ^ cow to milk. 17 Wear an Arab headcloth when with a tribe. Bedu have a malignant prejudice against the hat, and believe that our per sistence in wearing it (due probably to British obstinacy of dictation) is founded on some immoral or irreligious principle A thick headcloth forms a good protection against the sun, and it you wear a hat your best Arab friends will be ashamed of you in public. 18. Disguise is not advisable. Except in special areas, let it be clearly known that you are a British officer and a Christian. At the same time, if you can wear Arab kit when with the tribes, you will acquire their trust and intimacy to a degree impossible in uniform. It is, however, dangerous and difficult. Ike} make no special allowances for you when you dress like them. Breaches of etiquette not charged against a foreigner are not condoned to you in Arab clothes. You will be like an actor in a foreign theatre, playing a part day and night for months, without rest, and for an anxious stake. Complete success, which is when the Arabs forget your strangeness and speak naturally before you, counting you as one of themselves, is perhaps only attainable m character : while half-success (all that most of us will strive for; the other costs too much) is easier to win in British things, and you yourself will last longer, physically and mentally, in the comfort that they mean. Also then the Turks will not hang you, when you are caught. 19. If you wear Arab things, wear the best. Clothes are significant among the tribes, and you must wear the appropriate, and appear at ease in them. Dress like a Sherif, if they agree to it.20. If you wear Arab things at all, go the whole way. Leave your Lughsh friends and customs on the coast, and fall )ack on Arab habits entirely. It is possible, starting thus level with them, for the huropean to beat the Arabs at their own game, foi we have stronger motives for our action, and put more heart into it than they. If you can surpass them, you have taken an. immense stride toward complete success, but the strain of living and thinking in a foreign and half-understood language, the savage food, strange clothes, and stranger ways, with the complete loss of privacy and quiet, and the impossibility of ever relaxing your watchful imitation of the others for months on end, provide such an added stress to the ordinary difficulties of deal ing with the Bedu, the climate, and the Turks, that this road should not be chosen without serious thought. o 21. Religious discussions will be frequent. Say what you like about your own side, and avoid criticism of theirs, unless you know that the point is external, when you may score heavily by proving it so. With the Bedu, Islam is so all-pervading an element that there is little religiosity, little fervour, and no regard for externals. Do not think from their conduct that they are careless. Their conviction of the truth of their faith, and its share in every act and thought and principle of their daily life is so intimate and intense as to be unconscious, unless roused by opposition. Their religion is as much a part of nature to them as is sleep or food. 22. Do not try to trade on what you know of fighting. The Hejaz confounds ordinary tactics. Learn the Bedu prin ciples of war as thoroughly and as quickly as you can, for till you know them your advice will be no good to the Sherif. Unnum bered venerations of tribal raids have tanffiit them more about some parts of the business than we will ever know. In familiar conditions they fight well, but strange events cause panic. Keep your unit small. Their raiding parties are usually from one hundred to two hundred men, and if you take a crowd they only get confused. Also their sheikhs, while admirable company com manders, are too “ set ” to learn to handle the equivalents of bat talions or regiments. Don’t attempt unusual things, unless they appeal to the sporting instinct Bedu have so strongly, or unless success is obvious. If the objective is a good one (booty) they will attack like fiends, they are splendid scouts, their mobility gives you the advantage that will win this local war, they make proper use of their knowledge of the country (don’t take tribesmen to places they do not know), and the gazelle-hunters, who form a proportion of the better men, are great shots at visible targets. A sheikh from one tribe cannot give orders to men from another ; a Sherif is necessary to command a mixed tribal force. If there is plunder in prospect, and the odds are at all equal, you will win. Do not waste Bedu attacking trenches (they will not stand casualties) or in trying to defend a position, for they cannot sit still without slacking.

T.E.L. Route Report: Yambo to Abu Markha. 'Hie following route report has been received from Bimbashi Garland :— The first eighteen miles lies along the sandy plain stretching before Jebel Rudhwa ; there is no water and very little cover. Passing between the low hills, the road becomes heavy with sand, and after about three miles Bir Agida is reached, where there is one well about fifty feet deep, with plenty of water. The surface improves, the hills become higher, reaching to 700-1,000 feet, and the Wadi broadens out until, after about six miles, Nakhl Mubarak is reached, in the Wadi Yambo. The water at Nakhl Mubarak is clear and good and may be drunk without boiling. The oasis is similar to the other sixteen that are passed in close succession, these only differing in size ; Sueg and Bethna being probably the two largest. The growth of palms is luxuriant and could be much more so with proper attention, which does not seem to be given at present. There are markets at most of the springs, and sugar, sheep, dates, etc. may be bought at high prices. The following is the order in which the springs are passed : — Nakhl Mubarak; Jeria ; Muzra ; Ain el-Xur Agamia ; Ain Sulman ; Skobya ; Jebrya ; Ajlan ; Shaatha ; Ain Ah ; Suega ; Sueg (about two miles long) ; Asira ; Bethna (about one and a half miles long) ; Kheif Hussein. From Kheif Hussein the journey round Jebel Rudhwa, begins and the road is much less hospitable. The suiface is clogged with loose sand for long stretches. At the foot of Rudhwa there is water in several places, but it is generally one to two hours from the road. Twelve miles from Kheif Hussein the road reaches Fthe, where the water is somewhat nearer, being about half an houi s ride away, and is situated in a small wadi running from the west.— 354 — T . u xjnecpin the road leaves Wadi Yambo, and Wadi At Kherf H, s^ein ^ ^ ten miles .

A ,ate1 ' re P ort from Aden states that, about July 23 a meeting took place at Qafilet Udhr between the Imam and Sheikhs ol JJhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein and other Zeidi chiefs with reference to the murder of Abu lias. According to this report the Imam advised the acceptance of a monetary compensation but the Sheikhs refused, and the Sheikhs of Ibb have revolted against the Turks and the Imam. After the meeting, 4,000 men of Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein joined forces with Ivaid ibn Hassan the successor of Abu lias ; while several thousands of the Imam’s men under the command of Abu Naib (chief of the Al-Ahim section ol the Hash id ?) are said to he marching towards Mawia with what object is not known. A aid Ahmed of Hajarieh (see p. 319) recently wrote to Aden asking for arms and ammunition to assist in the movement against the ImkvS, and sent letters which he had received from Said Ahmed of I aiz, who anticipates success if assistance is given, and from Yehya ibn Yehya el-Shaif, chief of the Shaif section of the Bekil (p. 197). Kamaran reports that the general effect of the bombardment of Hodeida is good. The British Indians, however, have suffered, and are now reported to be treated as prisoners, being kept under guard about two miles out of Hodeida during the day and in the military barracks at night. Since the above was written, a telegram received from Aden shows that 1,000 men of the Hashid and Bekil, with some of their principal chiefs, have gone to Jeizan to meet the Idrisi, and are ready for service against the Turks if large subsidies are provided. The Idrisi declares that the assistance of the British Govern ment is necessary, and it is clear that money and food must be sent if the tribesmen are to be kept together. Sultan Salih ibn Omar of the Dhubi section of the Upper Yafa confederation (Aden Interior) has visited the Imam and concluded some agreement with him ; but he is, nevertheless, willing to join the Confederacy, and writes to Aden asking for a grant of £400. In his letter he refers to the enmity between the Imam and the Idrisi, and states that Nasir Mabkhut (p. 256) and Ibn Sarhan of the Hashid are friendly to the Idrisi. On returning from hisSECRET.

Several minor raids, at various points on the railway from Tebuk to Jedaha, have taken place since those recorded in the last Bulletin. Over one hundred rails were destroyed between Hadiyah and Jedaha on August 15. An engagement took place on August 17 at kilometre 1,120, near Muderrig, without result. South of Wadi Ethil patrols were ambushed by the Arabs, but Turkish reinforcements are said to have surrounded the latter, killed four and captured sixty. Patrols were attacked between Dar el-Haj and Mustabgha on August 18, and a north bound train was unsuccessfully attacked between Dar el-Haj and Bir Hurmas. Ibn Rashid arrived at Medain Saleh on August 17 with about 1,000 men, 100 horses, and, according to one report, 500 camels. The Emir was accompanied by Abd el-Hamid, delegate of the IVth Army, and Reshid Pasha, who is described as his Agent- General, and who intends to proceed to Damascus to report. He was welcomed by the G.O.C., Composite Force, and a council of war was held. It is reported that the Shammar and AnazeR tribes have seceded from Ibn Rashid owing to his recent reverses. Most of the men of Hail refused to accompany him, and those who did so were only induced to come on the pretext that they were to recapture Teima. The Turks fully realize the importance of restoring his prestige, and are believed to be preparing for an expedition against Teima, no less on political than on military grounds. The Turks are reported to have made an agreement with the Huteim tribe, according to which the Huteim will, among other conditions, drive the Sherifian Arabs out of the Meclina-Hanakiyah area, keep open the Medina—Nejd road, and protect caravans and guard the railway from Hadiyah to Medina. 1 he l urks under take to give free monthly supplies to all the Huteim Sheikhs, who are now at Medina awaiting ratification of the agreement. In a military sense the situation in the Akaba district has undergone no great change. The. Turks are still in the near neighbourhood of Maan, to which, apparently fearing an attack, they retreated from Fuweilah some ten days ago, and the forces of Auda Abu Tayi, supported by some 300 to 400 trained troops under Rashid Effendi and a French machine gun section, are at G uweira. Politically, however, things are moving. 1 he occupation of the place by the Arabs has raised Akaba to a position of considerable political importance, affording as it does an alternative means of contact with the Eastern Syrian tribes th ? ;7town with Auda Abu Tayi on July 6, holding a series of recep tions of local sheikhs, processions of whom, with their followers, attended by much expenditure of ammunition in feu de pie, flow daily in and out. His position as Sherifian representative has now been taken by Emir Feisal himself, who, long and impatiently expected, at last made his appearance with Jaafar Pasha and his trained force from Wejhon August 23. Auda, who had previously visited Nasir and satisfactorily explained the conduct to which Nasir had, as mentioned on page 322, taken exception, at once came in to pay his respects, and there are indications that the presence of the Emir will have a widespread influence on the attitude of certain Sinai tribal sections, who have hitherto shown coolness to ourselves. As regards local conditions of the population, which normally amounted to about 600, less than forty males remain, destitute ot‘ everything, while, as the result of continous bombardments at Italian, French and British hands, the town itself is only a mass of roofless ruins. Meanwhile, much has been done, partly by the crews and partly under the supervision of the successive warships stationed at Akaba, to prepare the place for future operations. A jetty has been constructed for landing supplies on a road constructed along the beach for evacuating them. Further operations to improve and extend these works are already in progress under the super vision of a French engineer officer and his unit. Journey to Abu Markha.

T\ 00e fcr tllc ridin g camels and Me, slid there A , t tlle last §heikh Abdel lw.de&gt; said there would be three other camels going with us,taking private stores for Sherif Abdullah, in charge of a native. This f took to be our complete party, and I had previously expressed a wish to Abdel Kader not to accompany any large party of hamla. We started from the house in Yambo at 6.45 p.m., but on arrival at the town gate we were stopped by the watchman for half an hour, as he would not let the baggage pass through without a pass from Abdel Kader. One did not resent this, as it appeared to indicate that some system of control existed, a feature to be encouraged at every opportunity in this country. On getting outside the gate, I found our party attached to a .caravan of about thirty baggage camels, carrying water-tanks, ammunition, etc. The Sherif was nowhere to be seen, and on enquiry I was told by my camel man that he had changed his mind about coming. If anything, I was relieved at this, as on former occasions I had found sundry Sherifs an impediment and was generally able to get along faster without one. 1 his one was an old man, pleasant enough, having three teeth a penchant toi cognac, and not much “nafas”; I foresaw that he would always favour long halts. On remonstrating with my camel man as to our proceeding with a caravan, he said we could detach omsehes i we w } s ® , but as our two camels were tied up and mixed with the remainc er, it would be better to do it next day. After com* slowly along for about two hours-and th'e Heinz hamla has acquired the art of going slowly to perfection stonpino- many times to pick up dropped cases and so forth, 1 noticed'the caravan was developing a strong tendency to zigzag. I went to the leading camel man and found him m an ominous low-toned consultation with another one as to where the road lay^ One head-strong youth swore lie knew the way and foith with took us along a route that was obviously wrong, but my pro- testations were useless. ■The zig-zagging got more pronounced, and when 1 found we had been on the' way over three hours with I stopped the caravan for enquiiy. a p Cei ‘ y , ^ Ihdits miite lost though only about five miles from Yambo. the ly o^vdiich couhl not be seen. Not a single camel man knew where the road lay, nor would anyone admit that he was the head ma of the party. , 1 decided to camp where I was for the night -th &gt;ny b^ gage, leaving the rest to do as they hked, and the blowing morning to return to Yambo for a gin e. The next morning, however, we saw the path quite close to SShs'tSTdidtr M^y'camel mhn a Mghly-skilled— 361 — but overpaid liar. He was endowed with a measure ot cunning far beyond his years, and I soon learnt that any proposals he put forward as being the best for my comfort were those most suited i • cmrl dp.sires. \fter trudging through the heat of the day from 6 a.m. to 4 „ m we reached Nakhl Mubarak, and I then told my camel man I’wished to proceed the next morning about four o clock. When I awoke that morning there was no sign of movement, and when 1 shouted to the men to get ready they said the bag- o-ao-e camels were absent, having been taken into the village by the man in charge. I sent my man-servant to warn him to get ready but he returned saying he had found with the camel man a Sherif (Sherif Sultan Abdalli), who had turned up during the iiio-ht and was in charge of the party. The servant said Sherif Sultan told him that we should not move off till the evening (which meant a day and night’s idleness for me at Mubarak), and that when he asked the Sherif to come to see me, as I was keen on starting forthwith, he only used insolent language and said that 1 was merely a servant of the Grand Sherif just as he was. However, he did eventually come to see me. He is something between a Beduin and a townsman, about twenty-four years of a&lt;&gt;-e, with a facial physiognomy of a most impudent type. To indicate his Sherifial dignity, I suppose, he carried a sword; but his clothes* were Beduin. He would not listen to my requests for my party and our two baggage camels to proceed at once, or that we should form a separate party. He said I might ride on if I liked, but the baggage would go with the caravan. We left at dusk. It was impossible, of course, for me to crawl along at the rate of baggage camels and so I decided to get on in front, then halt for sleep and overtake the baggage in the morning. We overtook it at Kheif Hussein, the caravan having done only eighteen miles in twenty-four hours. Sherif Sultan never got his caravan off before seven o’clock of an evening, whereas we noticed other caravans started by 5.30 or 6 p.m. The next night the arrangement did not work so well. My camel man had assured me that he knew the road the baggage would take (there being a choice of three routes over this piece of country). We did not see our baggage again for forty-eight hours. The caravan took a different road. For that period 1 was perforce on a very low diet, my food and cooking pots being with the baggage. The following morning the bag gage caught us up, and we camped at El-Dom. Here the Sherif had the effrontery to approach me saying. “What about my backsheesh?” To have a three days’ journey unnecessarily dragged out into six, to be treated to insolence and disregarded in my every wish, and then to be asked for a gratuity was almost too much. 1 hat night we were to start what I expected to be our final stage, and the morning, I hoped, would find us at Abu Markka. But I heard rumours of a visit to Nijl. Now Nijl was some sixmiles out of our way and meant deliberately turning; off the direct road to Abu Markha. Further, there seemed to be no legitimate reason for going there. But my efforts to get the Sherif to let my party continue its way direct were of no use, and I had to follow to Nijl, a detour that meant twelve hours’ further delay in Sherif Abdullah getting valuable stores that he was urgently in need of. At Nijl I again asked Sherif Sultan to let my complete party continue to Abu Markha after an hour’s rest, but he refused and said we should leave with the whole caravan at noon, which I knew was untrue, because he had no intention of leaving be fori' the evening. Evening came, and the Sherif said he had decided to stay at Aijl that night ; so I replied that I had not, and he finally agreed for my party and its baggage to proceed alone. This is not the first trip of the same kind 1 have had. In fact, 1 have only had one really satisfactory trip (with Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza). One has to submit to a load of indignities, and the waste of time that occurs in every business detail is appalling, even to one educated in the Oriental’s love of procrastination. I thought afterwards that it was queer that Sherif Sultan cared to have an impartial observer present with his caravan to witness the systematic robbing of convoys by the camel men during the journey. Such robbery is not peculiar to this particular caravan, but always goes on. Bags of rice, flour, barley, etc., are opened en route, a quantity of the contents are extracted, and they are then sewn up again. Transport is one of the great difficulties in war work here. Not for lack of animals, but rather because the personnel is of so poor a quality. There are plenty of camels, but they are seldom properly loaded and never employed systematically. The Hejazi will ever be indolent, I suppose. In his inner heart he is not keen on doing anything that might tend to shorten his revolt. He is fed well, and in most cases scandalously over paid, a new experience for him ; there is always a shower of backsheesh ready to fall on the slightest provocation, and so he says, May the war continue for ever !— 363 — LYBIA. Arrest of Turks by Idris el-Senussi. About the middle o£ June, Idris left Ezziat, whither he had (mne from Akrama (near Tobruk) at the conclusion of the negotiations with Col. Talbot and the Italians. He went west to Gedabia in response to a request from one of his officers, who informed him of a hostile Turkish force in that region. Since that time various rumours and reports have reached us about these Turks, and the native press the other day published an extraordinary story about an Arab revolt from the Turks in Barca (westCyrenaica). ' The following letter,dated July 19, 1917, from Idris to Sherif el-Idrisi (his Cairo representative and close personal friend, who was present throughout the recent Tobruk negotia tions)^ gives for the first time what may fairly be considered the correct story about these Turks, and it may be inferred that Idris has kept loyally to his agreement with us and, by means of an essentially Beduin ruse, has succeeded in clearing Gedabia of the enemy in its midst. The origin of this Turkish force in Gedabia is obscure, but it is highly probable that they came over by submarine from Misurata and were sent by Nuri and Ramadan Sewehli as an energetic form of remonstrance with Idris for his “perfidy” in making peace with the infidels. Musa Pasha el-Yemeni, the C.O. of the force, is an exceptionally able man and did fine work for the Turks at Zuara during the Turco-Italian war. Apparently, Idris either has not been able or has not deemed it politic to arrest Musa Pasha himself. Translation of Letter from Mohammed Idris el-Senussi to Sayed, Mohammed el-Sherif Abd el-Al-el-Idrisi. “30 Ramadan, 1335 (July 19, 1917). “Compliments. We have settled the question of the Turks, and the following are the details : — “ We ordered those who wanted to go to Nuri to travel at once, and five officers and seven men started. We then gave word to our patrol parties to arrest them should they reach them. They started on the 10th of Ramadan. “ On the 20th of Ramadan, we sent away fifty of them, including sixteen officers, and also gave word to our patrol parties to arrest them. “On the 27th of Ramadan, I gave Musa Pasha a definite order to the effect that all those who were at “El Kasr” should leave that very day, either willingly, or by force, and go to their Pasha, Nuri. He begged that they should be allowed to remain until the feast was over, but I told him that, if at sunset they were still inside “ El Kasr,” 1 would destroy it on their heads withguns, and that they should leave in six hours after receiving my order. So they left, much against their will, and stopped at a place about one hour distant to the west of the town. At seven o’clock on the evening of 28th Ramadan, we ordered our troops, whom we had kept ready at Shedalat, to follow them. At twenty minutes before dawn, our troops with their guns and machine guns succeeded in completely surrounding them. They were still sleeping and so, one by one, we captured them all and took all the arms and ammunition and Russian machine guns which they had. They counted eighty-seven, and ares till at El-Akta’ia, about seven hours to the south of Jeddabia. ATe hope to have them transferred on the 2nd Shawal to El-Kafra, as well as all others whom we found suspicious. u Just now we heard that all those who had gone across the fire line, or through the zone of our patrol parties, have also been captured and will be sent over in two days. A e have sent orders to our patrol parties to capture Jemal Bey in Daur el-Abyar, Abdel Kader el-Xajdi in Gerdis, and Abdel Rahman el-Yemeni in Khawlan, and the four Syrian gunners who are with him, as well as Goma Effendi and Rajab Effendi who are with the Bara’sa. We shall send them to join their companions at Kafra. Up till now the number of those captured is 149, including forty-one officers, apart from those whom we are going to capture soon. “ Salaams to Sayed Morghani and to all the Saveds and Ashraf.” NOTES. Indians at Hodeidah. It is reported from Kamaran that a Seyyid named Abdel Kader, of Marawa (a few miles north-east of Hodeidah), approached the Turks wdth a view to the removal of the British Indian merchants from Hodeidah to Marawa, promising to pay £1,000 and guaranteeing their safe custod} 7 . The Yali of the Yemen declined the offer, though he is said to have enquired whether the Seyyid would pay £2,000. He stated that the Arabs would release the merchants against a ransom from the enemy, but added that the merchants held a considerable amount of property and money, both at Hodeidah and in the interior, which the Turkish Govern ment hoped to secure so as to relieve the financial stress in the vilayet. It is reported at the same time that the merchants are in secret correspondence with the secretary of the Imam and the Zeidi Kadi at Sanaa with a view to their release. H adhramaut. Aden reports that, according to the statements of pilgrims, hostilities are expected between the Kaiti and the Kathiri. The latter have been in correspondence with Ali Said Pasha, who, it is said, intends to send them arms and ammunition {see p. 245).However this may be, the Haiti bultan undoubtedly intends to Xck the Kathiri Sultan, who refuses to recognize his suzerainty, and Kathiri troops are reported at Shibam and A1 Kutn, which “re close to the Kathiri country. The Sultan is sending h.s Wazir 'to renort to the Resident at Aden. It appears that he could put considerable pressure on the Kathiri by preventing goods from .roiin. UP country from Mokalla and Sheher, the only outlets wliidi the Kathiri have to the sea ; but he has not as yet applied News received from Mokalla since the above was written shows that the Kaiti Sultan has now decided to stop all caravans for the Kathiri country. He is also reported to have arranged a truce with, and given money to, his traditional enemies the Hamumi, who have hitherto been allied with the Kathiri. Yemen News. The Idrisi has entered into agreements, with a view to active operations against the Turks in Yemen, with certain sections of the Hashid and Bekil, at least 1,500 of whom are now at Jeizan. The most important Sheikhs among the latter are Masud el-Barak and Salih ibn Maid el-Moghrabi of the Dim Udhrah section of the Hashid, and Abdullah ibn Ghazeilan and Yahya ibn Yahya el-Shaif of the Dhu Mohammed section of the Bekil. Nasir Mabkhut is said to be on his way to join the Idrisi, who has also established amicable relations with three Sherifs of Kaukeban, probably of the Imamic house of Sharaf el-Din, and several other influential persons in the Yemen, including Abdullah, the brother of the Imam’s chief general, Seif el -1 slam M oh am m ed ibn el-Mutawakkil Mohsen. Idrisi is now said to have 5,000 men, in addition to his own forces from Asir, and he proposes to raise an army of 10,000 men, mainly of the Hashid and Bekil, with which he will clear the Tehama and hold the passes into the hills to prevent a flanking movement by the Turks or Imam. He further proposes that if the present Imam abstains from assisting the Turks, and will come to terms with the British Government after the conclusion of hostilities, he shall be left undisturbed ; but that otherwise he shall be deposed and his lands given to a new Imam appointed by the tribes. His programme, therefore, is not identical with that of the Con federacy as hitherto reported, and his relations with it are somewhat obscure. He has sent a message to Aden that he wishes, in the event of his success, that we should appoint a ruler of the Tehama, as he has no desire to rule there. It will be remembered that last December he claimed the whole of the Tehama down to Mokha (Bulletin No. 37, p. 7), and it may be doubted whether he has really abandoned this claim.In considering the Idrisi s plans, it may be interesting to note the distribution and approximate numbers of the Turkish troops in Yemen. these are estimated as follows :— On Idrisi’s southern boundary : 1,440 men, with twenty- two guns and one machine gun. In the Tehama : 600 men, six or eight guns and one machine gun. In the northern and central highlands : 550 men and some guns. At Mawia and Taiz : 500 men, six to eight guns and two or three machine guns. In front of Aden : 2,075 men (including 850 Arabs), about thirty-five guns and four machine guns. Moza district and Sheikh Said : 250 men and eleven guns. In view of the insignificance of the Turkish garrisons in the highlands, the Idrisi’s anticipation of a flanking attack suggests that he contemplates hostilities with the Imam as well as with the Turks. According to an estimate of his resources which has been forwarded from Aden, his Customs’ revenue up to last May amounted to over $50,000 per month. Imports having recently decreased, he has apparently made up for the consequent loss by imposing a tax of $5 on every camel load leaving Jeizan for the interior. From the salt works at Jeizan he receives an income of about $20,000 per month, and he collects tithes, etc., from other parts of his territory. His Wazir, Mohammed Basahi, makes large profits by buying, dollars in Asir and selling them at a much higher rate in Aden, the export of dollars by any other persons being prohibited. Idrisi does not pay his soldiers on acti ve service, but only provides them with rations. Though nominally every able-bodied men in the Jeizan territory is liable for military service, he cannot in reality raise even 20^ of the population without the risk of provoking a rebellion, for his subjects, many of whom are engaged in business, dislike fighting except in defence of their own homes. The disturbances resulting from the execution of Abu Has show no signs of abating. Risings are reported from several districts. The Zeidi tribes are threatening Kataba, Mawia and Jebel Jihaf. [lias Bey, the Commandant of Taiz, has been held up since June 22 at the village of El-Kaida, and All Said Pasha is believed to be unwilling to release any of his troops at Lahej to send relief to the besieged Commandant. At the meeting between the Imam and the Zeidi chiefs, reported on page 355, the latter are said to have declared that nothing would satisfy them but the beheading of IN asir Muqbil and his Turkish supporters. As the head of Abu Has was hung for three days at the gate of Mawia by Yasir Muqbil, and as— 367 — hundreds of their tribesmen had been killed and wounded in the recent fighting by Nasir Muqbil’s men, it would be a lasting disgrace to the tribes if adequate revenge were not taken ft is reported that the 4,000 men of the Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Hussein who, after the meeting, joined forces with Raid ibn fdassan (see p. 355) had a successful but severe engagement with Nasir Muqbil’s force near Gebel al Kadama. Another unconfirmed report has reached Aden of a fight between the followers of Sheikh Mohammed Hassan of Gebel Habashi north of Taiz, and a Turkish force advancing to enforce a demand upon him for $ 40,000 as arrears of taxes and a war contribution. Forty of the Turks are said to have been killed. The Sheikh is the head of a religious fraternity at laiz, and was formerly known as an ardent pro-lurk, but was attacked in 1915 by Ahmed Naaman, Kaimmakam of Hajarieh, for refusal to pay It is now reported from Aden, that the Imam s Commander Abu Naib, who was mentioned in the last Bulletin, as marching on Mawia, has left Rahida with his men and will probably pass through Ibb and Dhamar on his way back to the Imam.SECRET.

Shei if Abdullah claims to have destroyed five kilometres ot' railway and eight bridges on August 18, and it is reported that odd lails, thirty telegraph poles and six small bridges were destroyed between Muderrij and kilometre 1103, on.August 23,' two Arabs being killed and two Turks wounded. A thousand rails have also been blown up by the French detachment in Sheri 1 Abdullah’s sphere. Harb tribesmen state that many houses in Medina have been pulled down for firewood for the engines. A report from Sherif Ali speaks of the sacking of much property, and says that the Turks are looting Medina owing to hunger. It is reported that Fakhri Pasha has been ordered to send all his Camel Corps to Jerusalem, and that he replied that this would mean surrender. On August 28 the Flying Corps dropped over 100 bombs on the railway and buildings at Maan, and eight direct hits were obtained on the engine sheds. A field battery and other troops in the neighbourhood were successfully bombed on the 29th. Sherif Zeid states that one to three Turkish (as well as Arab) deserters arrive daily at his camp near Medina, and that others arrive at the camp of Sherif Ali. These deserters are in a weak condition, and report that the Medina garrison is disheartened on account of the destruction of the railway, and the stoppage of trains. It is stated by the King that Sherif Zeid has occupied positions which isolate Bir el-Mashi. There is no further news from Akaba, where there are at present about 2,000 trained Arab troops. The Turks have still a post at Fuweilah. Raids on the Railway. Bimbashi Garland reports as follows on recent railway raid ing operations made by Sherif Abdullah’s lorces at Abu Markha camp. He left the camp on August 7 with the intention of breaking a long section of line between Istabl Antar and Bueir, and arrived at the foot of Jebel Antar on August 9, in the morning. The party consisted of thirty-six natives trained in demolition work, including nine Ageyl, seven Tambo townsmen, and twenty men from the Sherifian trained army (chiefly Mesopotamians). The escort detailed by Sherif Abdullah was 400 strong, but at no time during the operations did it exceed 200, and was under a Sherif Nasir. After feeding and watering at a spring called Helwan, neai Jebel Antar, about an hour from Istabl Antar station, the party proceeded at dusk towards the railway, and after negotiating a most tortuous path over the Jebel south of Jebel Antar, met tie— 370 f,,,.,. sc0UtB who had been sent forward to reconnoitre They reported that the Turks were patrolling the line and had fired on them 6 Sherif Nasir sai.l that apparently they hail had notice of our intentions from the Beduin hving at Helwan and that it was useless to proceed that night. 1 he party returned to Helwan. The next morn ire-' it became clear to Bimbashi Garland how the Turks had become'aware of the presence of: the Arab party. He was astonished to find that Abu Kami station as well as that of Istabl Antar, could easily be seen, when pointed out, from the position on which the party was camped, and that the previous day n approaching Helwan the party had marched some ten kilometres alon- the Wadi containing the railway m easy view of any observant Turk at either of these two stations I he proximity of the latter had not been pointed out to him, and he had supposed that the line ran along the other side of the range of hills, which However, the next night, patrols reported that the Turks were not patrolling, but were occupying a hill some three kilometres south of Istabl Antar station, and it was decided to make a small break between these two points and leave the district. About 7 p.m. the party left Helwan, and passing Istabl Antar station on the left at about 1,000 yards, at which point the camels were left behind, proceeded on foot for about a mile, when the line was reached. About 100 rails were destroyed, but the Turks appeared as lighting up was being finished and the demolition party had to withdraw under fire, reaching Helwan as dawn was breaking. That evening, August 11, the party proceeded to a point between Abu Naim and Jedhah stations to destroy 1,000 rails. Much delay was caused here through the position selected by Sherif Nasir for leaving the camels being about one and a quarter hours’ march from the line, and so it was after 2 a.m. when the party actually got to work. Some 850 rails were destroyed, but Bimbashi Garland had much trouble in getting the Ageyl and Yambo men to do the work correctly, some of them refusing to remove superfluous charges from the rails w^here five or six had been put on one rail. He found it practically impossible to thoroughly supervise alone a purely Arab party doing a break of 1,000 rails, and his comments on the matter are given below. The explosions occupied about an hour and a good break was effected, the party getting away just at daybreak. During the firing of the charges, Jedhah station turned a poor search light on the party but no Turks were encountered. A return was made to Ain Turaa, where a fresh supply of explosive, sent by Sherif Abdullah according to arrangement, was found. 1 he party left this place again on the afternoon of August 14, and reached the proposed point of attack (between Jedhahand Hadiyah stations) at about 12.30 a.m. Beduin scouts reported all clear and the escort was supposed to occupy points on the left and right of the section of line to be destroyed. The dynamiters marched towards the line, each carrying about thirty pounds of guncotton and unarmed, over two rows of hills covered with heavy drift sand. They were proceeding roughly in line, and Bimbashi Garland reports that as he and two of the Mesopotamians were approaching a railway bridge of four spans, about thirty Turks opened rapid fire on them at about fifty yards range. The flat treeless wadi provided no cover, and a hurried retreat was made, whilst the Turks kept up a furious fire, to which the Beduin made a desultory reply from hills that were at least 1,000 yards away from the line, points that were obviously useless for covering the railway at night time. After about a quarter of an hour, the Turks hurried away to the north, and the dynamiting party returned to the line and destroyed some 800 rails, but it was impossible to inspect the damage done, as morning was approaching and the Beduin escort had proved of a rather migratory nature. There were no Arab casualities, but this was chiefly because the Turks made the mistake of firing a few moments too soon. The party returned to Abu Markha on August 16. A second party, including French Mohammedan troops for the dynamiting, left Abu Markha three days later with sufficient explosive to destroy 1,000 rails, whilst a third party of Egyptian Army soldiers, under El Miralai Davenport Bey (recently arrived at Abu Markha) was due to leave with the intention of breaking about 1,600 rails about a week later. Bimbashi Garland’s remarks on Arab demolition parties are as follows :— “ These purely Arab demolition parties on a large scale are very difficult to control ; in fact, it is a mistake to suppose that the British officer does in any way control them. They carry out only such parts of one’s schemes and instructions as suit them, and often flatly refuse to make alterations when mistakes are pointed out to them. I am advising Sherif Abdullah to dispense with Ageyl and other natives for demolition work, as they are too unreliable, and are very expensive, each man s monthly pay being E.E. 15. The Mesopotamian and Syiian soldiers are very much better, and under well-trained officeis (which he has), will do the work well. It is extremely difficult for the British officer when, for instance, he finds men tying two and more charges to one rail and the Arabs refuse to move the surplus ones, to have to do so himself. In fact, there is not time for it, as extensive demolitions occupy some three hours, and this even does not give sufficient time to thoroughly inspect the whole length of line prior and subsequent to firing the charges.«Also as the Turks are taking more effective steps for .mardit the line, it is necessary that some means be provaled of gtuiumg , ’ ,, duin escort occupies positions on the flanks ensuring &lt; iye ones&gt; This means that the command of expeditions must not be left to Sheikhs and Sherifs. but must be liven to the Sherifs trained officers. o Ibn Sand's relations with Ibn Rashid. T nv n f the suspicions which were at one time cast on the attitude of Ibn Sand by Sherif Abdullah (p. dl4), the following letters are of interest as showing his loyalty to the Arab cause letter from Ibn Rashid to Ibn Sand, dated May 7. U p ra i ses be to God, our affairs are all right. May God save u You know what happened between you and myself in the past and the cause was the devil Sand ibn Salih al Subhan. By the &lt;»■ race of God now that cause has been removed. Nothing is more dear to me than to do good to the Mohammedans, and according to what I know you too desire it. I have therefore “ My belief in God and then in you is good. You need not be anxious about me, because we, God willing, are on what pleases you, on what existed between us in the past. “ I beo- that in case you accept it you should send a trust worthy deputy, so that we make an arrangement and a duplicate copy will be sent to you. Sal am s.” Letter from Ibn Sand to Ibn Rashid dated May 15. “ Praises be to God, our affairs are all good. I received your esteemed letter and duly understood its contents, especially what you mentioned about peace. You say that you want peace. You know, 0 brother, that the dearest thing to us is to effect peace between Mussulmans, and to unite the Arabs. If this was a matter between us and you, there could be no hitch. Your excuse is accepted and thank God nothing happened but good. About the future, we place in you good belief. But, 0 Brother, the matter nowadays does not rest in my hands. If you want good to happen, and you want your interests and those of the Arabs, peace can be concluded only under three conditions. “ Firstly, you should sever your relations with that wretched 1 Government which gives loss to our religion as well as our world. I mean the Turkish Government, who did not leave anything undone, and lhe last thing they have done is the disgrace they I meted out to Muslim women, about which you must have heard. “ Secondly, you should befriend yourself with the Government whose allies we, your brother Arabs, are, and we ai\; bound to unite all Arabs. -Your interests are under their hands.Thirdly, you should HpfVionrl \r/-&gt;n&gt;.t.^ip ..rUi, j-i— oi___.!p it is necessary to help him it is far better lor one to keep aloof from him.

Had the object been a personal motive or self-interest between myself and yourself, I tell you by God the rieat that I want your peace. But by God I do not intend but these conditions, and I will not withdraw them, even at the risk of my life. There are two reasons : firstly, that I have given word to that effect and my word cannot be changed ; and secondly, by God I have never known any more bitter enemy against our religion and the Arabic element than the Turks, and whoever possesses Muslim zeal and Arabian honour will fight them. If you accept this, I promise you what you require. Give us binding and bonds to this effect and you may come with Salih al Hadhdhal to take agreement accordingly. If, however, you do not accept, God will decree in what lies good for us (and He will save us from your evil and we do not depend upon our efforts only). This is what had to be mentioned. Please give our salaams Urbrothers. From here our brothers and sons send you compliments. May you be ever preserved.” Letter from Ibn Rashid to I bn Saud dated May 20. “ I have received your esteemed letter dated the 22nd Rajab, 1335 (= May 14, 1917), and duly understood its contents. The terms which you have mentioned are not agreeable to the interests of our religion as well as our world ; the matter there fore stays where it was. May it be known to you. From me salaams to brothers and sons. My sons send you compliments.” The following notes are taken from a report dated' July 2, 1917 For nearly two years before the capture of Baghdad the Euphrates below Musaiyib had been out of Turkish control. In May, 1915, immediately after the battle of Shu’aibah, an attempt was made by the Turks to master the towns of Karbala and Najaf, which besides being exempt from conscription were harbouring Turkish deserters. It resulted in street figthing in Najaf, but in the end the Turks were obliged to give way ; the government of the two towns was taken overby the town Sheikhs, and Ottoman authority was for the time being withdrawn in all but the name. 'The elements of disunion in the countryside were, however, largely in favour of the 'Turks. The Mujtahids were jealous of the Sheikhs, who were jealous of one another. Still The Najaf-'-Karbala, District. MESOPOTAMIA. more acute was the rivalry between the towns and the tribes— 374 — , • ri ,„ towns The hitter have command of a greater fighting Xet h tha' be produced by the town leader^ and long estobhshed animosities made them ever ready to play into the hands of the Turks against the towns The most miportant tribe between Najaf and Karbala on the nght bank of the Hmd.yah branch and partly on the left bank also, is the Bam Hasan, and the two principal Sheikhs, ’Amran and Alwan sons of Hap c ’],, n have long beui a source of anxiety to both the Holy Places ’ On the left bank of the Hindiyah, the Fatlah, and their neighbours the Yassar on the Hillah branch above Hillah, had oufscores against the towns and the opportunity to pay them off In April 1916, occurred the famous disturbances in Karbala which ended once more in the discomfiture of the Turks. Both Kin'af and Karbala threw off the semblance of Ottoman rule established during the months which had elapsed since the rising of 1915 and thelown Sheikhs resumed their authority. On this occasion the Bani Hasan had given some assistance to the Turks, and the towns knowing the temper of the tribes had little con fidence as to the future. The jurisdiction of the town Sheikhs was confined to narrow municipal limits, beyond which there was no semblance of order. Lhe tribes, all of which aie loose confederations made up of more or less independent constituents, did as they pleased and defied the ruling of paramount Sheikhs whom the Turks were impotent to back; river and high road were open to their depredations. Such was the position when the Turks withdrew in March 1917. Within the municipal limits of Najaf and Karbala the town Sheikhs had the ordering of civil government, but their authority rested on a very uncertain basis and was constantly menaced by the tribes. Up to the fall of Baghdad the Turks had held Musaiyib, where the Baghdad-Karbala road crosses the Euphrates, above the bifurcation of the Hindiyah and Hillah branches of the river ; when they left, a provisional government Was set up locally. Outside the towns anarchy prevailed and no road was safe. Apart from the pressing appeals of the towns that we should take over civil government and place it in the hands of British officers, there was a further consideration of great importance to the Army of Occupation. The Euphrates basin from Musaiyib to Sanaawah is one of the chief food-producing areas of the Iraq. Baghdad normally depends for its food upon this region and upon the Ba’qubah-Khanaqin district, and since only a small part of the latter is in our possession, the Euphrates corn-lands acquire a yet higher significance. At the time of occupation, the winter- sown crop of wheat and barley was almost ripe ; the Government dues, especially if they could be collected in kind, were obviously a most valuable asset, and it was essential to establish some control over the district, so as to prevent the harvest from leaking into the desert, either to the Turks or to Syria. It mustbe borne in mind that the fact that the Turks have lost this rich food-producing area is to them one of the most disastrous con sequences of the fall .of Baghdad. Early in April permission was obtained for two Political to reoort o^Tbe ^ Najaf ’ via Hindiyah, to repoi t on the state of the country and the prospects of the grain market Towards the end of the same month, primarily m the interests of the supply question, a Political Officer was ™dh headquarters at Musaiyib, to organise Arab levies (Shabanah) for patrolling, to begin with, the main routes ot supply into Baghdad, viz .those from Hillah, Musaiyib and IvarbaJa, with which places, pending the appointment of Govern ment agents, relations had been conducted directly by the Chief Political Officer from Baghdad. For the time being the functions ot the local officer did not extend down the Euphrates Valley further south than Hillah. 1 To establish security on road and river was the first task the most powerful tribe on the southern half of the Baghdad- Musaiyib road arid along the Musaiyib-Hillah road is the Zubaid who hold the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris’. Flie head Sheikhs of two large sections were accordingly encouraged to co-operate with us in the protection of these roads by providing their quota for the Shabanah, and, pending the expansion of the scheme, the protection of the main routes south of the three towns above mentioned was entrusted to local tribal headmen. The presence at Musaiyib of a British column, which had been sent out to avenge the murder of a British ’ officer between Musaiyib and Fallujah in May, greatly facilitated the inception of the Shabanah scheme. At first there was a general disinclination on the part of the Sheikhs concerned to agree to their men being employed outside their own tribal limits, but this attitude is not an unnatural one, and it is expected that as time goes on, and their relations with us become more intimate, it will disappear. ABYSSINIA. The French authorities at Jibuti have seized some letters sent to Ali Said Pasha by the two Germans from Adis Abeba who were recently reported in French Somaliland (see p. 317). One of these letters, giving a message which the Pasha was to telegraph to Berlin, shows that the Germans believe that Lij Yasu has no chance of returning to power, but that the probability of Ras Taffari being able to establish a strong government is almost equally remote. A letter from Ganiazmach Bayena, ex-Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Vienna, announcing the accession of the Empress was also captured.— 876 Mission’s departure having been facilitated by The German Mi^on s t A1Hed le ^ ations at Adis Abeba the Abyssmiati au . io &gt; ^ Government, insisting on the have addressed a protest^ ^ ghould it return to arrest _ and d _ is ..•'A out that, should any further facilities be Ahyssima^snd J „ cre ate trouble, the three Powers would KlSed^ieritasabreach of neutral,tv. Adis Abeba reported under date August 1 that the news t yin was somewhat unsatistactory. L.j Yasu had gone trom Wo,lo ‘‘ fc Q £ his force which broke out from , M n rr ,nd had occupied Talanta, the capital of Edju. Dejaz Anndfe not having sufficient troops to hold it, had fallen back ■o old his father Ras Wolye, and them combined army was reoorted to have occupied a strong de enstve position, leaving t'i nT In the hands of the rebels. Lij Yasu reopened the telegraph line and sent a message to the Italian legation that he was certain of victory. On August 8 our Minister wrote that Lij Yasu had marched south from 0 Edju and joined up with Ras Imer for a movement so-iinst Dessie. Their forces reached that place m advance of the Government troops and appear to have scored a success, takino- some 300 prisoners, including the local Commandant. Only the rumour of approaching reinforcements kept them from occunyin 0 ’ the town, which was apparently defenceless. On tie following day the Government army under Fitauran Hapta Glorias arrived, and a skirmish at long range took place without much loss on either side. The rebel troops took up a position on the neighbouring bills, while the Fitauran occupied the town. Fii Yasu’s army numbers only 4,000 to 5,000, but he can count on the support of the local Moslem tribes, who are to a certain extent provided with rifles. Hapta Giorgis has about 30,000 troops in the field, but they are thoroughly tired of the war, and owing to the rains ne cannot be reinforced betoie I 1 v \ 1 \ /'v v» The attitude of Tigre, moreover, is causing considerable anxiety, and although the Government have for the third time forced Ras Seyyun.to take the most solemn oath of fidelity to the Empress, they still hesitate to allow him by return to his own country lest he should throw in his lot with Eij Yasu. The disinclination of the Fitaurari’s troops to continue fight ing may possibly compel the Government to withdraw Horn Wollo, of which Lij Yasu might then remain an independent ruler. Abyssinia in the past has always tended to split up into independent kingdoms when the central power was weak, and i seems not unlikely that the same process is again taking place. The provincial chiefs show an inclination to stand aside l l0U ^ what they regard as a personal contest between Ras Taftan an Lij Yasu, and respect for the central Government is rapu ydisappearing. The Empress and Ras Taffari may retain their titles and nominal supremacy, but they will probably lose ail real control over the great provincial rulers. Since the above was written, a telegram from Adis Abeba gives the satisfactory news that Li] Yasu’s army was completely defeated on August 27 by Hapta Giorgis, and that Ras Imer has been killed. The fate of Lij Yasu himself is still unknown. He has shown a remarkable faculty in the past for deserting his followers on the field of battle without losing his prestige among the Mohammedan tribes, and it is much to be hoped that he has not again made good his escape. NOTES. Sheikh Salim of Koweit. Our Political Agent at Koweit writes under date June 18 : — Sheikh Salim has many detractors and some of his employees are far from loyal. His inscrutability and a rather forbiddingRemeanour are qualities rather discouraging to tattlers and intriguers. But in all that concerns the business of the British Government’s interests, I have found him hitherto pleasantly amenable. The missionaries do not love him. He has not called on them since his accession, which is regrettable, but, on the other hand, when written to by them about a certain bit of land which the former wished to add to their property, he replied in a frank and friendly manner agreeing to let them have it and promising to come and inspect the site. The Indians at 1:1 odeidah. . The Turkish authorities in the Yemen were recently approached with a view to the release of the British Indian prisoners at Hodeidah. General Ahmet Tewtik, the G.O.C., and Mahmud Nadim Pasha, the Vali, replied that on the outbreak of war they received orders to detain all enemy subjects, but that these subjects enjoy complete freedom, and are kept in comfort. They state that they can only release the Indians if we produce official instructions to that effect from the G.O.C. at Constantinople, and they express a hope that this will be done. Meanwhile, the prisoners have been moved fifteen miles inland.SECRET Arab Bureau, Savoy Hotel, Cairo, September 18, 1917. No. 63. SUMMARY. ARABIA. (a) Hejaz Intelligence. (b) The Situation at Akaba.

Daieuports party, with Sherif Shaker and about ,000 Arabs and four guns, left Abu Markha on August 28 and inarched via Bit* Aim* and Bedawi to Bir Ain Turaa, where three Aral) desei ters came in from Abu Naam. On the night of September 1 they halted six miles west of Abu Naain station, and early on the following morning Major Davenport began laying charges on a bit of curved railway south of Abu. Naam. The work was interrupted by a heavy fire from the south and from hills to the east, but the charges laid were fired and about •500 rails and three miles of telegraph line were destroyed. An Egyptian officer and seven men were missing, while the Arabs captured about thirty Turks and killed twelve. Next day a party of Arabs completed the demolition of the big curve which the railway makes at this point; it is hoped that these curved rails are irreplaceable. The prisoners taken were ravenously hungry, and stated that they recei ved only a water-bottle of water and one small loaf per day. Some of them believed that supplies are being carried to Medina from Syria, every fortnight, by an aeroplane as big as a train and resembling a “ huge cigar,” which one prisoner professed to have seen. Sherif Zeid, with artillery and Syrian troops, has arrived at Yambo en route for Akaba. An enemy aeroplane visited Akaba on September 7 and dropped three bombs, but no damage was done. The enemy have attacked Wadi Musa, but are reported to have been repulsed by the Arabs, who killed forty Turks and themselves lost eleven. Sherif Nasir is said to have gone to Wadi Musa, where the Turks are likely to make another attack. They are alarmed by the anti-Turkish movement among the Arabs of this region and are doing all in their power to prevent it from spreading northwards. Further details have been received of the recent bombing raids carried out by the R.F.C. in the Maan area (see last Bulletin, p. 369). Thirty-two bombs were dropped at Maan on August 28. The station and adjoining buildings were hit many times, eight bombs falling directly on the engine sheds. One bomb hit the Railway Inspector’s house, and four fell within* fifty yards of the aeroplane hangars. An enemy machine was seen on the aerodrome but did not rise. No bombs were dropped east of the railway, as the Turkish hospital is situated there. Our machines returned safely, though hit in many places by machine-gun fire and shrapnel. On August 29 seventy-four bombs were dropped on the Turkish camps at Fuweilah and Abu el-Lissan with good results._ 380 Tl.P DTpatest coafasion was caused, and a direct hit was obtained on a field battery. Our three machines were again subjected to intense rifle, machine-gun and shrapnel fire and were all hit. Several Syrian notables have arrived at Sherif Feisal’s camp at Ataba among them being Emir Abd el-Kader el-Je Z a,n and Ounr and Faiz, sons of AH Pasha el-Moayyad. The latter is of he‘influential Damascus family of El-Arm. part of which ,s •o-Turk and part pro-Arab. Omar anil Fair escaped some time Lo from Broussa and organized a band of brigands to harrasstbe furks round Damascus. Emir Abd el-Kader is one of the three sons of Ali Pasha Jezairi, who was President of the Chamber oi Deputies at Constantinople and deputy lor Damascus. His father was the famous Abd el-Kader of Algeria. The Egyptian Mahmal has arrived at Jeddah on its way to The Situation at Akaha. The following notes are taken from a report by Captain Macindoe, M.C., dated August 27 A hostile Turkish force operating from Maan would have to approach Akaba by either the northern road or the eastern road. The northern road runs through easy country from Maan to Delagha. From Delagha to Gharandel there is a narrow and win dm o- defile for some sixteen miles to be traversed, but as soon as the Wadi Araba is reached, the road becomes easy for any body of troops with a camel transport, but not for wheeled transport, as there is very soft sand. Jdieie is also a plentiful water supply, even at this time of the year. The eastern road runs through easy country from Maan to Fuweilah, and not difficult from Fuweilahto Gueira ; but from six miles this side of the latter place it runs through the narrow gorges and defiles of Wadi Itm, which would he exceedingly difficult of passage in the face of organized opposition. _ Water is obtainable at Fuweilah for a force of 3,000 men and animals, and at Gueira for 500 men and animals, but there is no water between the two places. From Gueira to Akaba there are small wells in side valleys easy to defend. It must he borne in mind, however, that in two or three months’ time water might be plentiful every where. The troops at Akaha consist of some 2,000 so-called regular troops under the command of Gaafar Pasha. They consist of 1,600 infantry, divided into two regiments, the north and the south regiments, 300 cavalry-and camel corps, and 150 artillery. Gaafar Pasha is proceeding with the training, and the men do a little company drill, hut I think he quite realizes that it would he useless putting them up against anything like an equal body of trained Turkish troops with any hope of success.Something, however, might be made of them in time, especially the cavalry (mule and camel), machine gunners and artillery, as long as they are not asked to fight any pitched battle with the Turk, but are used entirely as irregulars, and only for minor operations. Pilgrim Accommodation at Jeddah. There are about 200 houses in Jeddah which accommodate pilgrims. A quarter of these houses are known as “ Wakalas ”, and are vacant except in the pilgrim season, when they are let out to u Wakils ” and “ Mutawafs ” for the sole purpose of housing pilgrims. The “Wakalas” are mostly situated in the Yemen quarter of the town and can take in about 10,000 pilgrims. They are the property of the King of the Hejaz, of members of his family, of the Zawa Zeid Ashraf family, of Mohammed Nassif, the King’s agent at Jeddah, and of other wealthy^ merchants in the Hejaz. The largest of them is owned by the King himself, and can accommodate about 2,000 pilgrims when tightly packed. The nominal price for pilgrim accommodation was fixed by the Turkish Government at P.T. 2 a day for the first three days and P.T. 1 for subsequent days, and'this was approved by a com mittee appointed by the King in August, 1916. It is generally admitted, however, that a pilgrim is lucky if he gets off with P.T. 10 for a night’s lodging. Nearly all the large private houses facing the harbour and many in the Yemen quarter are built with spare rooms for lodgers, and the tenants endeavour to obtain the whole of the yearly rent, often amounting to £150, in the few weeks of the pilgrim season. In addition to these houses there are several free houses called “ rubats,” which have been built and are maintained as “ waqfs.” In the Yemen quarter there are three rubats foi Bokharis and two for Indians. The Mutawafs who live in Mecca have their representatives in Jeddah. Wakils of the Javanese, Indians, Bokharis and others are always in residence there, and are well-known citizens of the place. They, in turn, have their deputies who travel back with the pilgrims to their own countries, remain there preaching the duty of visiting the Holy Places, beat up recruits for the next pilgrimage and return with them to Jeddah. Each man, as he lands, will find that accommodation has been aiianged foi mn either by the deputy on board or the Wakil on the landing stage, and if by any chance he evades these he will soon be picked up by another Wakil in the town.MESOPOTAMIA. ru.C'' Sui] d-Shuyukh Tribal Affairs. The following notes are taken from the Administration Report of the Issistant Political Officer, Suq el-bhnyukh ' Suq is to Khamisiyah as Basrah is to Zuhair. The chief trade is done in Suq, whilst Kham.s.yah ,s the gate mto the desert. Khamisiyah, in other words may he looked upon as the Khan for caravans coming from Had and Central Arabia to nurchase goods from Suq. At one time, before the marshes existed between the desert belt and Suq some filty years ago), camel caravans used to come right up to Suq, as also didthe big escorting companies of Fb., Rashid who annually conducted the Hai from Suq to Mecca. In those days llm Khaims was the recognized leader of the Najd community of merchants who made Suq'their headquarters. The big marshes having formed between Sun and Khamisiyah, Ibn Khaims transferred a portion of the Nandi population to the far side of the marshes to what is now known as Khamisiyah and built a sort of bridgehead there ; to-day caravans put up in Khamisiyah, while goods are sent out from Suq, by boat in summer and donkey in winter. The arrangement suits the desert man well, especially as he avoids the Surra fly area, in the vicinity of Suq, which used to kill off many of his camels annually. From the date of the capture of Kut, the attitude of Suq tribes has undergone a marked change for the better, ft is too early to say whether this change is only a temporary one or not. Open hostility to us, 1 fancy, they will put away for good, as they are quite shrewd enough to realize that whoever holds Baghdad holds Iraq. There still remains, however, to be dealt with the innate hostility felt towards any form of government by the average Arab. This will have to be gradually removed by whoever is A.P.O. during the next few years, and also by the process of education. There appear to be several causes for this rather pardonable state of mind. First we have the had govern ment of the Turks before, us, the tyranny of the Saadun before them, and lastly the fact that they, the tribes, have tasted the sweets of almost complete freedom from any sort of government restraint for the last fifteen years or so. The fact that no rice, date or wheat revenue has been paid for many years to the Turks has had its effect, especially on the younger generation of tribes men, who are in consequence arrogant, conceited and boastful. I heir arguments are crude hut logical, and are something as follows : — Firstly, “No Government” means that we retain crops or money which would otherwise he taken from us in the form ot revenue. Secondly, we retain lands from which we have ejected the rightful owners, therefore we have to pay no “ mallakiyah(rent) to anyone, and have gained and possess good rice lands for nothing. Thirdly, we exist and are prepared to defend ourselves by right of our strong arm, always a popular form of existence among savages. The above is more or less the argument of the young braves ; the wiser and older heads, on the contrary, believe in the English and especially in their ability to rule, and look for great things from us. Possibly they expect too much ; they dream dreams, and are for ever talking about the great railways, ships, canals, irrigation schemes, hospitals, schools, etc., etc., that we shall introduce. As is natural, however, they apply things to them selves and are already beginning to wonder what immediate changes will most affect their own lands and crops. They realize that one of the first things that we British will enforce will be the proper payment of revenue. They fully understand that this must come, and all agree as to the justice of it. Doubtless they will endeavour to put off the evil day as long as possible, but, beyond a little bluff, such as attempting to prevent trees being counted etc., 1 do not think there should be any difficulty in gathering in a full revenue in about two years from now. NOTES. Abyssinian Neivs. Despatches from Adis Abeba show that the position of the Regent, in the weeks preceding the defeat of Lij Yasu on August 27 (see p. 377), was becoming increasingly precarious. In the middle of August Fitaurari Hapta Griorgis was still at Dessie, while Lij Yasu was at Amba Sel some thirty miles to the north-east. The Government ordered Dejaz Igazu to take a force northwards to support the Fitaurari, but Igazu flatly ref used to do so. This was the second instance within a month of a leading chief refusing to obey the orders of the Central Govern ment, the previous offender being Dejaz Kabada. Ras Taffari s prestige was being further undermined by the intrigues of Queen Taitou (see p. 37), Dejaz Igazu and Fitaurari Felahoun with the Empress, with winch he was powerless to deal. A rising in Tigre under the leadership of Hailu Mariam is reported to have been crushed by Ras Seyyum s troops under the latter’s son, Dejaz Kassa. Year Goba in the Arussi country (see p. 150), the province of Dejaz Bayena, the Abyssinians have successfully repulsed a night attack by the Moslems, both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Moslems were led bj Mohammed Yusuf who, earlier in the year, was reported from Nairobi as a fanatic who was preaching the Jehad m Southern Abyssinia and proclaiming the coming of a new Mahdi.384 — It reported from Aden that the German Mission from Adis Abeba {see p. 375), which was presumably attempting to read] Arabia, has been captured in French Somaliland and taken to Jibuti. South- Western Arabia. Reports from the Yemen show that the unrest among the Zeidi tribesmen is not abating. The revolt in the Ibb region is headed by three Bekil Sheikhs, Abu Barb, Kaid ibn Rageb (p. 2020 and Yahya ibn Yahyaesh Shaif (p. 355), and by bayed Mohammed Hassan (p 367 ). Sayed Mohammed is said to have lost influence by his present action, and his Taiz followers recently broke off relations with him on the ground that he had joined the Zeidis against the Government, These leaders, with at least 3,000 men, have taken in) positions on Jebels Ras, Baadan and Meeiah. 1 hey aie opposed by Elias Bey with some local irregulars, about 300 Millah Arab troops, 150 Turks with some guns, and the followers of Moham med Nasi r Muqbil and Ibn Ahmed Naaman. Up to the present nothing beyond a few skirmishes appears to have taken place— in one of which Yahyaibn Yahya esh Shaif was slightly wounded though there is an unconfirmed rumour that fbb has been captured from the lurks. Local native opinion considers that the Zeidis can do nothing beyond occupying the attention of the Turks, since there is no religious incentive to induce others to join them, and they lack a common leader and are unable to obtain supplies from outside. Meanwhile the Imam has been doing what he can to stop hostilities. He is said to have joined the Mali in issuing a pro clamation calling on the people of Yemen to defend themselves and their country from the Zeidi rebels. He also recently sent Seyyid Mohammed ibn Yusuf Said id Islam to the Dhu Hussein, offering $ 13,000 as a ransom for the murder of Abu Ras and certain territorial priviledges. He ordered them to cease fighting, as otherwise he would consider they were fighting, not the Turks but himself, and would send a force against them. It is also stated that, at the instigation of the Turks, he is preventing the Arabs of Rada from coming to Aden. Some interesting correspondence has come into the hands of the Resident, Aden, from Jeizan. Sheikh Ahmed ibn Ahmed esh Shaif, of the Ghazeilan section of the Dhu Mohammed, wrote to the Imam that he had tried to keep his people from joining the infidels (i.e. the British), but that to do so he needed his stipend. The Imam’s reply, written on the back of the letter, was a curt refusal. He added that he did not believe anyone would join them, that he who is a friend of them is one of them, and he who fights for them is worse. This letter was written eight days before his letter to Aden, in which he proposed an agreement with us.Lhe Zeidis are said to be still in possession of Juban Kawa and Knbiatein (see p. 805). ’ Wfl An attempt by Sheikh Mohammed Nasii- Muqbil to canvass reenuts toi' the Turks in the Radfan district throu&lt;.|, Sheikh Muqbil Abdullah who had with him $1,000, only resulted in the collection of thirty men.

Nasir Mabkhut (p. 2bo) and Masud el-Barak, chief of the Dim Udhrah section of the Hash id, are now at Jeizan.

Our Agent at Koweit, writing on June 28, reported that not more than a third of the Shammar were at that time supporting fbn Rashid, the remainder including the Aslam and some of the Abdah—having come over to our side. Qasim seems to be the main source of supply both to Hail and Medina, although Ibn baud is knowm to have issued the strictest orders against trading with enemy countries across the border. ^ His authority in Qasim is not by any means absolute; it is subject to many limitations and may be less at the present moment than for some time past. the people who count in Qasim are the traders. Any restrictions on their business imposed by Ibn baud would be likely to drive them into the arms of Ibn Rashid. though tbn Rashid is weak now, there is always the chance, they think, of the Turks returning and Ibn Kashid becoming top dog again. Ibn Sand, too, is not everywhere popular; the town of Buraidah is said to be against him. The men of Qasim would doubtless fight for Ibn Sand if attacked, but their loyalty, if taken outside their borders to attack Hail, is more than doubtful. In the abortive campaign against Hail, on which Ibn baud set forth so impressively, all the tribes owning allegiance to Riyadh were beaten up and marched to Qasim. There, whether on account of the frigid attitude of the Qasimis, their own lack of confidence in themselves and their leader, or the temptation of finding an exceptionally good spring pasturage, tbn baud could accomplish nothing. Some manoeuvring took place and time was wasted in futile peace negotiations.

Intelligence. Attacks on the railway have been more frequent than usual during the past fortnight, especially in the area of the 2nd Composite Force, i.e. between Maan and Muadhdham. Some have been vigourously repulsed by the Turks, but the difficulties with which the latter have to contend [ire evidently increasing. On September 15, the Arabs attacked a Turkish detachment between Wadi Ethil and Ear el-Haj. The Turks were reinforced by cavalry and a severe engagement took place, the Arabs being driven back with considerable loss. On the same day some rails were destroyed south of Ramleh, and on the following dav at Mudawara ; in both cases the line was repaired without much delay. On the evening of the 16th the Arabs are reported to have cut the railway and the telegraph line between Tebuk and Wadi Ethil, but retired on the approach of a reinforcement train from Tebuk. On the 17th they destroyed some rails and small bridges between Akabat el-Hejazia and Bir el-Shedia. A bridge south of Mudawara was blown up while a train was passing over it, and a considerable number of Turks were killed or wounded ; troops were sent out both from Maan and Tebuk, but it is not known whether the bridge has been repaired. The Arabs are said to have attacked a party of the enemy who were cutting firewood in the neighbourhood of Wadi Ethil and to have captured most of them, including two officers. The question of fuel is one about which the Turks appear to be much concerned. Another is that of the water supply, and it is reported that brick walls are being built round the reservoirs along the line. In the southern area, a party under the orders of Sherif Abdullah cut the railway and telegraph line between Bowat and Bir Nasif on September 15 and 16. After destroying a large number of rails, they retired on the arrival of Turkish reinforce ments, and an Egyptian soldier is said to have been killed. Sherif Abdullah reports that a force under Sherif Shakir defeated the Turks between Abu FTaam and Istabl Antar, killing thirty- three and taking seventeen prisoners and a quantity of rifles, water skins and blankets, and destroying six kilometres of railway. Sherif Sharraf is now at Wejh, where he will’ probably remain for the present. At Medina, all the Turks are said to be now inside the town. They have, however, seized all the dates in the neighbourhood, and also much property of the Harb tribe. Ihe Harb tribesmen are consequently among the most active of those now serving in the Sheriflan armies. There was some hard fighting round Medina early in August, the Arabs attacking from north and west.— 388 — Enemy aeroplanes dropped bombs at Akaba on September 12, 15 and 17, and on the first occasion killed seven Arabs and WOU1 Sherif U Feisal states that an enemy cavalry squadron attempted to reach Delagha but was driven back alter heavy L hti L It was reported from Akaba on September 20, that three unsuccessful demonstrations had been made during the fpw ( lays by the enemy in the direction ot Wadi Musa. The Arabs } claim to have killed 100 Turks, including a Commandant, and to have captured mules, camels and a machine umi An enemy force was said to be threatening Wadi Musa from Busa five miles south of Petra, and mounted troops had left Akaba to oppose it. The Turkish aim, is to bar the way to the north and to retain both the valuable wood areas round Hishe on which they rely to provide the fuel during the coming winter, and the Kerak grain district. They show no disposition to advance on Akaba at present. _ There has been a shortage ot fodder in the Maan area, especially of barley, and the enemy’s horses are said to be weak throuo-h'want of food. The inhabitants of Akaba who left it before its ‘capture by the Arabs, and who went to Maan, are. reported to be in a starving condition. Sherif Feisal’s arrival at Akaba has evidently created a great impression among the Arabs further north. A nephew of the Sheikh Umjelli (Mujali) arrived at Akaba on September 8 from Kerak and informed Sherif keisal that the Keiak district is awaiting his orders and the arrival of a Sherif to rise against the Turks 0 The Arabs of the Bir Saba district are also showing a disposition to co-operate with us, but they, too, insist on the presence of a Sherif, and Sherif Feisal has detailed Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza for this purpose. * Palestine. The Jewish Colonies. It is a departure from precedent to admit party controversy to the Bulletin, but the following memorandum by one of the leaders of the Jewish movement, dealing with the criticism that the Jewish penetration of Palestine is to the detriment of the native population, is perhaps of sufficient interest to warrant an exception. No responsibility is, of course, taken for the accuracy of its contents or for the views expressed. Curchases of Land by Jews in Palestine. u Owing to the official and secret restrictions imposed by the Turkish Government, issued in order to hinder the purchase oi land by -lews in Palestine, and owing to the intricacies of the Turkish law concerning the transfer of property in general, it takes a long time, and endless trouble and expenses, to carry out such deals and to obtain a deed.For these reasons, and also for reasons of policy, it did not pay the Jews to purchase small lots, belonging to farmers. We preferred to buy large properties (“ Latifundia ”) held by Syrian bankers, landowners and other Palestinian euphemisms for usurers, suckers of the blood of the fellah. To this policy we have stuck with but very rare exceptions, if any. The tillers of the land were not owners, but workers on lease. Owing to the peculiarities of the Turkish law, under which ten years of uninterrupted occupation developes into squatter ownership, these had to be removed from the property when it changed hands. This necessity of frequently displacing the land-tillers is regularly practised by all Syrian landowners, such as the Sursok family. It is very likely this removal, always unpleasant, sometimes even forcible, of the fellahin from the land they used to work but never owned, that has given rise to the wholly unfounded calumny that the Jews drive out the poor landowner without paying him his due. (See Note at end.) Jewish Segregation. The Jews have been reproached for their exclusiveness and for keeping the Arabs out of their villages. It is true that we have strictly avoided Arab infiltration in our villages, and we are glad of it. From national, cultural, educational, technical and mere hygienic points of view this policy has had to be strictly adhered to ; otherwise the whole Jewish Renaissance movement would fail. Had we permitted the squalid, superstitious, ignorant fellahin, hard pressed by their Syrian brethren, the usurers, to live in close contact with the Jewish pioneers, still feeling their way and seeking the trail which might lead to their salvation, the slender chances of success which, at their start, was all that the Jewish settlements seemed to possess, would have been impaired, since w T e had no power, under the cruel Turkish administration, to enforce progressive methods, or even to ensure respect for private property. In the few cases where we failed to stick strictly to this policy, we met with failure from the Jewish national point of view. In Rosh Pinah (Arabic: Ja’uneh), for example, the Jews and Arabs live, not indeed together, but close to one another. This continual contact may have brought about fairly friendly feelings between the two races, but at the cost of the material, moral and mental development of the Jewish settlement. Notwithstanding the great variety and fertility of their land, the Jewish farmers of Rosh Pinah are the poorest and the most unprogressive among our Jewish settlers. They remained on the same'footing as their fellahin neighbours.— 390 — Yet from the educational point of view, Rosh Pinah had t Tt other ewis . g a rea ] j ew i s h Pestalozzi, a forerunner of SoSori “began his career in Rosh Pinah and practised there h r years ’ H?s immediate successor is the next best known Hebrew teacher. For a quarter of a century the pedagogic methods of the schools of Rosh Pinah have been copied as worthy models. Yet, whereas all over Palestine, m the seore&lt;mted Jewish villages and town-quarters, these methods yielded the most gratifying results, they nowhere produced such poor effects as in Rosh Pinah, owing to the unavoidably deffradin^ effect that continual contact with the uneducated fellahin had on the Jewish youth. In other places, although the' two races were kept apart, there was no deep ill-feeling between Jews and Arabs, and the former have never wished to keei) the latter down. So far as the conditions of the Jewish schools permitted—all these schools are supported by private, inadequate donations — Arab boys have been admitted to Jewish versus Arab labour. From the beginning of the Jewish colonization work thousands of Arab labourers earned their bread on Jewish land. The Turkish oppression was so hard that numerous small farmers or owners of olive orchards abandoned their property and pre ferred to work on daily pay in the Jewish villages, which escaped both the Turkish taxation and the Syrian usurer. This was specially so in Judaea and Samaria, where the intensive agri cultural methods, developed by the Jews, the creation of numerous vineyards and orange groves, etc., required thousands of hands. The'village of Petah Tikwah employed from one to two thousand Arab workers daily, according to season—mostly Araishi from El Arish. The Turkish military drafts, the railway and other public enterprises, and the general development of the country made labour scarcer and dearer, and this improved the openings for Jewish skilled labourers of a higher standard of life. They were, however, preferably used as foremen, supervisors, etc. Since about ten years, however, w r e have had in Palestine an artifically bred “labour problem”, as we have more or less artificial class fights and problems. With the failure of the Russian revolution, after 1905, the influx of Jewish immigrants brought along quite a number of those Russian disorganizing elements of whom we hear so much now—would-be anarchists, maximalists, etc., who tried to implant in Palestine, in the Jewish milieu, all their bankrupt ideas and foolish dreams, without taking into account that, whether justified or not in Russia, where they originated, ihese dreams were entirely out of place, and, in fact, positively disastrous, as applied by them in Palestine.Starting from the most generous premises, they tried to inaugurate the wildest agrarian reforms. They wanted the nationalization of the land, the grant to every individual of no more land than he could till with his own hands, the abolition of all capitalistic concerns and of the so-called exploitation of the Arabs ; and to that end, however paradoxical it may sound, the interdiction of any other than Jewish labour on Jewish land, if we were to assert our national rights and national independence. These demagogic ideas could find but little sympathy in the propertied bourgeois classes. Still, a few enterprises on which these ideas were to be put into practice in the most orthodox fashion did spring up. It was in the nature of things that such enterprises should go in for extensive agriculture only, growing cereals and the like, under which relatively large areas can or must be cultivated by few hands ; for that reason they were, with one or two exceptions, established in Lower Galilee. It is not surprising that these attempts should have turned out utter failures. Still, a good deal was spoken, agitated, and printed about these fanatical adventures. They unquestionably did lots of harm, but only to the Jews themselves. Not one single Arab less was employed on Jewish property; not one single Arab workman suffered loss by reason of them. But the Jewish work suffered greatly in its development. Would be investors were discouraged and their confidence shattered by the acts of sabotage of the fanatics, the more so that in our villages we could not possibly call on the corrupt Turkish authorities to maintain law mid order. We had to rely on our self-imposed institutions and regulations, which these disturbing elements ' sometimes disregarded. The whole opposition of Jewish labour to Arab labour amounts then to this : a handful of fanatical talkers trying to u protect ” the poor Arabs from “ capitalistic exploitation ” and, in order to do it, generously forbidding them to work at all. Attitude of the Jews towards the Arab Revolt. The Palestinian Jews have good reasons to hate the Turk and to help to rid the country of him. They have no interest, and still less confidence, in the Arab Revolt. They are not in a position to take up arms against the Turk, and they would hesitate to join the Arabs, even if they were in a position to do it. So far as we know the Arabs, the man among them who will withstand a bribe is still to be born. According to theii ovvn proverb: u Fifty prophets would turn liars, before a Bedouin would speak the truth.” Lack of idealism among the leaders, lack of real public opinion aipong the uneducated masses and, above all, Moslem solidarity, will always cause the Palestinian Jews to keep a neutral attitude in this fight between lurks and Arabs. In order to help to defeat the lurk they will ica i y join the British forces, but it is doubtful whether they will ever trust the Arabs._ 392 — P,„t although we cannot promise our confidence and . ' Arabs in their striving for their national deliverance, we L least make no opposition to the success of their efforts and abstention from acttve co-operation should no be rtl Advantage of by them to encourage, or placidly allow, attacks oil Jewish property and life for mere reasons of jealousy and lust for robbery. Such attacks would hardly serve the Arab cause International Jewry may still be too loosely organized to fight for the Jewish regeneration in Palestine ; but it will always h? found Strongly organized when it comes to defeat the common , I a,. \,.„1, loaders are too wise not to understa jj otf The above memorandum has been submitted to •mother Zionist leader of equal authority, who takes exception to the implication on p. 389 that, Jewish purchasers sometimes find it necessary to expel the dwellers on lands acquired. He “Never in the history of Jewish colonization have Arabs been expelled from their villages. In the first place, the greater part of the lands acquired for colonizing purposes are lands hitherto uncultivated and uninhabited because of either their swampy or unhealthy character, or their reputed lack of fertility Secondly, the Jews are not exposed to the danger of their claims being ‘ jumped ’ by Arab cultivators, since they become resident proprietors of the lands held by them and, by payino- the taxes themselves, defeat the possibility of any such occurrence. The large Arab proprietors, on the other hand, being absentees and in the hands of incompetent or dishonest agents, are sometimes obliged to take the step described. ABYSSINIA. The Overthrow of Li] Yasu. During the fortnight preceding the defeat ol Lij \asu (recorded on p. 376), the news which reached Adis Abeba from the north all tended to show that he was extending his influence in the Wollo and Edju districts. Communication between Dessie and Worra Hailu was cut off, the population having risen against the Government. An urgent demand for reinforcements, however, came through from Fitaurgri Hapta Giorgis to the capital, and on August 26 the Government ordered that every man who had a rifle was to be ready to march in eight days’ time, while instructions were sent to Harrar to send up 8,000 men without delay, and to Dejaz Balcha (see p. 259) to come at once to Adis Abeba from Sidamu with his army.Meanwhile the attitude of Tigre was doubtful, the Danakils were reported to be concentrating below Ankober, and considerable doubt was felt about the intentions of Negus Waldo Giorgis, who had sent a force of 7,000 men towards Wollo. In Adis Abeba armed bands were attacking and robbing the shops by night, and the German Minister called a meeting of his adherents and, after warning them that important events w r ere pending, instructed them in this case to go to the Legation, where arms and food would be provided. On the 28th the anxiety prevailing in the capital was suddenly dispelled by the news that on the previous day Lij Yasu had attacked the Fitaurari in the neighbourhood of Dessie and had been defeated with tremendous loss. Ras liner was killed, Fitaurari Serabezu seriously wounded and a prisoner, and the Wollo army practically destroyed. The loss on both sides is estimated at about 18,000 men, and little quarter seems to have been given. Nothing has since been heard of Lij Y T asu, who has probably escaped to the low country. It is now known that Negus W 7 aldo Giorgis’ force under Ras Imam, whose movements had caused the Government much anxiety, succeeded in making their way through Edju and Lasta and joined the Fitaurari some days before the battle, contributing largely to his success. NOTES. Nawwaf Shaalan. Strong letters have recently been sent by Sherif Feisal to Nawwaf, asking him to define clearly his attitude towards the Sherifian movement, and also to negotiate for the purchase of camels, the shortage of which is becoming serious. It is now reported that he has lately fled from Damascus owing to the Turks having hanged Mohammed Milhem, a big Sheikh of the Hasaneh section of the Anazeh, in spite of their promise to Nawwaf to pardon him. This may have an important effect on the attitude of the Shaalan family towards the Turks. Nuri Shaalan is in the neighbourhood of Jebel Druz. The Beni Sakhr. Fawwaz el-Faiz died last month. He had gone to Amman at the invitation of Jemal, and it is generally believed that he was there poisoned by the Turks, on account of his pro-Sherif leanings, by poison given in a cup of coffee. 1 his has caused great resentment among the Beni Sakhr, who attacked a Turkish post at Madeba, killing two officers and some soldieis. Fawwaz is succeeded by his son Mesh-hur, aged 25, who is strongly pro-Sherif, and has sent a message that his tribe are awaiting the signal to rise against the Turks. They aie said to be well supplied with arms and ammunition, and are at piesent on good terms with Nuri Shaalan’s tribe, the Ruwallah.— 394 — Conditions in lurkey. • i f qi -f u • i&gt; Fl - r Abdul Kadi.- el-Jezeiri, whose arrival at bherd heisals 1 • . w Bulletin, reports that the internal ^ditib^s oTAsia Minor and Syria are exceedingly bad, and that no^public 8 seourit'v exists. The country is filled with bands of deserters and it is everywhere unsafe to travel; even the gendarmerie can only move in parties of five or six. Talaat and Jemal are reported to have formed an alliance avninsi Enver, whom they accuse of having sold Turkey to the Germans. Talaat has refused to take extreme measures against the numerous deserters. The Ahd el-Kadir Family. When Turkey entered the war, the Abd el-Kader family were suspected of intriguing in the Arab nationalist cause, and one of them, Omar, was hanged. With the exception of Emir Abd el- Malik who still heads the anti-French malcontents m Morocco, they were deported to Brusa, where they now live in honourable confinement. Abd el-Kadir el-Jezeiri, who escaped from Brusa and travelled secretly through Asia Minor and Syria, has now offered the allegiance of the family to Sherif Feisal. Libya. It is reported that enemy submarines arrive regularly at Misurata, where they discharge cargoes of munitions, guns, wireless apparatus, etc., and large sums of money. The pive Turkish elements are thus greatly encouraged and the position of Seyyid Mohammed Idris is rendered precarious. Somaliland. The German armourer who has been with the Mullah is reported to have died while attempting to reach the coast. This man’s name was probably Emil Kirsch, and he went to the Mullah last year from Abyssinia with the assistance of Lij Yasu. Being treated as a prisoner in the Mullah’s hands at I ale, he appears to have escaped one night about the middle of June accompanied by his servant. His strength gave out after some days, and it is thought impossible that he can have survived. His servant left him and has been picked up near Musha Halid in an emaciated condition.SECRET.

Abdullah was in W adi Ais, acting titfullv and without consistent plan against the southern section V the line Ali and Zeid remained south-west ot Medina unable to isolate the garrison of Bir el-Mashi from Headquarters, but with help from Abdullah, fairly successful m preventing the’ relief of Medina from the direction of Henakiyah and the East No tribe lying north of the Billi, except some incon siderable constituents of the Beni Atiyah and the Huweitat, had yet come into action. At the close of September we find Feisal with the main base of operations moved up to Akaba, the extreme northerly point of the Peninsula, and there lie is to he joined by Zeid and most of the “ regular” constituents of the latter’s army. Outposts have been established Eastward, beyond Gueira, some thirty miles from Maan, and as far North as Wadi Musa near Petra (or even at Shobak), from which point communication is open with Kerak. Touch with our Sinai forces is about to be established through Nakhl. Abdullah and Ali remain in their old positions, but it is proposed that the former shall soon move north; to Jeyadah, while the latter reports that he has isolated Bir el-Mashi. Beyond increasing his outposts in the immediate environs of Medina the enemy has made no sustained advance either from that city or from the railway south of Maan, i.e., he has resigned himself to holding no more of North-West Arabia than the northern Holy City and one line of communication thereto. This hold is undoubtedly weaker than it was, and he has more than once thought of abandoning it. As for Medina, the most recent reports from deserters, etc., show that about a sixth only of the civil population now remains ; that many buildings have been wrecked to provide fuel for the railway, while private houses have been sacked ; that bare necessities for the troops have run very low, while luxuries and proper forage have practically ceased ; and that little coined money is in circulation. As regards the railway, while better organized and sustained raids have been made on the southern section under the experienced direction of British officers, and with regular troops, Egyptian and Arab, the area of attack has been extendednorthward to Maan and even beyond. At the same time the north Arabian section, from Maan to Medain Salih, has not been neglected. September saw much raiding activity on both sides of 1 ebuk, and one of the most serious disasters which has occurred on the line, the wrecking of a double-engined train on a culvert, near Haret Ammar, on the 19th [See p. 401). It is not possible to give an accurate total of breaks effected, still less of rails or even bridges cut. The Arab reports often tell of so many “kilometres destroyed.” In such -cases we can presume several breaks over the distance claimed, but certainly not demolition of the whole length, nor, necessarily, demolition of both rails at any point. Nor can we be sure that many rails have been damaged beyond re-use [see Colonel Newcombe’s remarks, on p. 407). As for the “bridges,” they are rarely more than culverts. During the three months just about thirty raids have been made upon the long stretch between Bowat in the south and Ghadir el-Haj in the north (700 kilometres). The total of rails reported to have been dealt with is 7,630, plus an undefined number assailed by purely Arab parties, which have not reported details of their achievements. On the face of the reports, we might assume an inclusive total of not less than 10,000 rails. But certain reservations must be made. Only on a few occasions have even British-led parties been able to inspect their work after firing their charges. Purely Arab parties never inspect. Charges fired do not necessarily mean an equal number of rails damaged ; still less do they mean rails damaged irretrievably. As Colonel Newcombe says (p. 407), if a five metre length of rail is unhurt, it is left in position. \\ r e may, therefore, safely deduct at least 25% from the above assumed total of rails destroyed ; and if we conclude that the Turks have had to replace 7,500 in all during the three months, we shall perhaps be still somewhat above the mark. Whether this be so, however, or not, the local reserves are known to be nearing exhaustion. Medina, which is reported by a reliable deserter to have had three large stacks of spare rails^at the beginning of the year, has now only a remnant of one of these. Most sidings have been taken up along the line south of Maan ; and it is reported that Fakhri Pasha, to quiet the apprehensions of his men, has had to put it abroad that wooden rails will be used. As for “ bridges,” we have had the demolition of over thirty reported during the period, but of these perhaps only one, the bridge north of Abu Naam, is more substantial than a culvert. In the case of culverts the practice of the Turks is to fill in the gaps with earth and relay the rails atop. It is probable, therefore, that as soon as the rains have come down, they will have some automatic breaks to deal with, winch wil call for more thorough reparation. On the Haret Ammar budge, broken on September 19, the G.O.C.’s instruction was to effect397 — i .nr-h tomDorarv repairs as would just allow the passage of tr ins Demolition o£ telegraph plant is rarely reported to us in deta 'and is often neglected by purely Arab raiders We have durine the three months of about two miles of telegraph w demolished at two points, and of some hundred poles with wire, destroyed elsewhere besides several mere cuts. Some interruntion of the lines has, indeed, taken place about every second day Apart from these interruptions, the lurkish military authorities are known to have had and be having, continual difficulties owing to the overloading of their land wire, the inadequate capacity of their wireless, and the disinclination „ i -i tn allow them rull use or the tratfie wire. . While the supply of water to stations, unprovided with water-towers or wells, has not yet proved so serious as might have been expected, the fuel question is causing ever graver uneasiness to the enemy south of Maan. We know that some south-bound trains have had the utmost difficulty in getting through on their supply, and that it has been necessary to hold them 'up for hours at stations till wood-fuel could be brought down. There is only one good source of supply for the whole 800 odd kilometres south of Maan, namely, the Hish forest in the Shobak district, to which a light branch line six miles long has been laid. It is to safeguard this, quite as much as to cut communica tions between Feisal and Kerak, that the Turks are so anxious to regain control of Wadi Musa. It will be recalled that Major Lawrence, during his great raid in July, appeared at both Shobak and Hish. The upshot of the matter, however, is this : that the railway south of Maan had not been permanently cut by the end of September. In spite of ever increasing difficulties, of whose effect on the local commands we have ample evidence, the Turks have been able to keep up intermittent communication with Medina and to supply the bare necessities of the H.E.F. and the two Composite Forces, as well as those of Ibn Rashid and his following of some 1,000 men. The position of these forces, therefore, is not yet desperate, and, indeed, in the face of the outer world, is little different from what it was in June except, perhaps, for the increasing disaffection of the Beni Atiyah and open defection of the Fuqara and southern Wuld Ali, counter balanced to some extent by continued neutrality on the part of most of the Billi. They have had, in appearance, an accession of strength by the arrival of the Emir of Hail and his men ; but, in reality, the character of the Emir himself, the temper of his followers, and the drain of supplies, caused by their arrival, more than counterbalance the advantage of their presence, either on the L. of C. or in Medina itself. On the whole, seeing what the retention of Medina and of the long L. of C. is entailing on the Ottoman General Staff, we may look with equanimity on a prolongation of the present situation.The enemy’s position at Maan itself must react with in creasing detriment on his difficulties further south. There with a long stretch of L. of 0. to safeguard, south and north, with the all important Hish district to protect and Wadi Musa to recover, with the enemy based at Akaba, and in force no further off than about thirty miles—having further to reckon with the hostility of all the greater local tribes, and the imminent opening of direct communication between the latter and our Sinai army—the Turkish G.O.C. can rely on only six weak battalions and the doubtful support of a few of the smaller Kerak, Shobak and Huweitat clans. He cannot attack Wadi Musa in force without exposing to grave peril Fuweilah, his chief outpost now held by two battalions, and leaving his H.Q. at Maan with no more than one cavalry regiment, which has been reported by its O.C. too weak to sit its horses or fight. On the other hand, though Audah abu Tayyi,. at Gueira, is a more daring and effective Bedouin leader than any the Turks have had against them in Hejaz, he is, like all his kind, some what unaccountable and open to other than purely military considerations. He may be induced to forbear just when he could strike most decisively. Of the forces at present at Feisal’s disposal, Audah’s following is the only element with which a serious offensive could be undertaken. Jaafar’s “ regulars,” O' with their indifferent officers, are hardly to be relied on for more than defensive operations, and Zeid’s “regulars” will not be much better when they arrive. While Akaba is fairly secure with its garrison and protecting British monitor, Fuweilah and Maan may not prove to be in so precarious a situation as represented, even if the G.O.C. draws on their garrison strength for a Wadi Musa expedition. The success of this expedition will depend in the main on the action taken by Audah and the Huweitat, and the attitude of the chief Shobak and Kerak clans. About the latter’s disposition we presume Akaba has more information than we possess. We can only note, as to the good, that the Mujali Sheikh, the principal man in Kerak and chief of a clan actually detailed by the Turk to guard their L. of C. at Kutrani, north of Maan, has visited Feisal recently. The hour even now has not struck for bringing in the Arabs of the Syrian Desert, the trans-Jordan lands, and Syria proper : but considerable progress has been made in preparations for their co-operation. Nuri Shaalan and his son, Nawwaf, have re-affirmed their loyalty and readiness and have asked that their Ruwallah may buy necessary supplies in our controlled Mesopotamian markets. If this is allowed, we shall acquire a strong pull on them and their chiefs. Ibn Hadhdhal and the Amarat maintain their friendly attitude to us, and lately we have had news of the two remaining greater constituents of the Northern Anazeh, the Fedaan and the Seba, drawing away from the Turks in the north and rallying towards Ibn Hadhdhal. The Beni Sakhr have been embittered against the Turks by the— H99 — i v.Ar, which is believed universally to have death of * 9 . all( j ? as indicated above, the main been caused some elements of important Kerak body ^ of the H l ^ at ’ Q t^h-eadv come into action. ARABIA. North-West. Intelligence. There is a hitch about Sherif Zeid’s move to Akaba. During his halt en route in Wadi Ais, Abdullah has persuaded him to stay on ostensibly to join in an offensive operation against the railway. There is a money question behind Zeid’s action and, possibly, some fraternal jealousies lurk behind that again. Feisal s pecuniary demands, owing to the large and indefinite area of operations and of tribal elements with which he has now to deal from Akaba, have orown much above his allotment, and the diversion of sums from one brother to another, and the grant of extraordinary sums by us to one and not another, have caused soreness. W e have had this sort of trouble before in the matter of transport amma s and stores detained en route and shall have it again. After all, such unauthorized levying of necessaries in transit is not unknown to more regular generals ! Cairo and Jiddah are doing their best to get the financial distribution adjusted. Meanwhile the food crisis at Akaba has been relieved for the present. From the southern section of the railway, Sherif Abdullah has reported a successful raid carried out by a Billi Sheikh, Abdullah Muhanna, north of el-Ula. He claims 230 rails damaged and ten Turks killed. Also another raid on the Bir Nasif-Bowat section, which cut four culverts, and “ destroyed eight kilometres” of track. There has been, lastly, a serious attack made between Seil Matara and Zumurrud which has cut communications and put over 100 rails out of action. A e await a detailed report of this. Abdullah further states that he is reconnoitring the line up to and beyond Abu Xaam, presumabl) with a view to the combined offensive which he proposes to take with his brother, Zeid {see above). Suleiman Rufadah, of the Billi, is now reported gone to Syria and there has been no news of him for some time. The only important operation to be recorded on the northern section is Major Lawrence’s raid at Haret Ammar detailed below (p. 401). The Turks have demonstrated their ability to keep the railway open by getting Memduh Bey, the “ Surra-Emini^ (Almoner of the Holy Places), through to Medina on September 2/, just in time for Bairam. On his passage through Tebuk, the chief Beni Atiyah sheikh and others demanded their usual surra, hut were refused it, presumably on the logical ground that they had had no Hajj to guard this year. They took the ref usal ill, and were quieted with difficulty by a promise of receiving their money on Memduh’s return passage. As the likelihood of their getting it— 400 — then (Damascus lias reported it has no coin to spare) is very small, we may look (as do the Turks) for their defection in the near future. The O.C.’s both at Tebuk and Maan are asking nervously and insistently for reinforcements of men and guns, which Damascus will not send. Disease, desertion, and Arab raids are steadily reducing the Composite force, while the Maan command, as said on p. 398, is up against the extreme difficulty of holding on to its outposts at Fuweilah, Ohi and Merifa,. if it is to make any serious effort to regain Wadi Musa. Some small Iverak and Shobak clans have been summoned to help guard the inadequately defended line south of Amman. This is a pis aller, seeing how fickle is the loyalty of the local clans. The poor quality of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, now T in garrison at Maan, was demonstrated on the night of September 28-29, when a dismounted corps, drawn from it, was unable to save a repair-muig from suffering disaster on the Hish line, and losing thirty-one prisoners, while its train was wrecked front and rear. The cavalrymen were then withdrawn and replaced by an infantry battalion from Ohi. Another report on this affair, from an Arab source, which puts the prisoners at twenty-three only, states that mounted troops of Feisal’s drove three companies of Mule M.I. (detachment of dismounted 7th Cavalry Regiment?) out of Shobak and occupied the place temporarily. The majority of the horses at Maan are now unfit for service, and if better accommodation, than exists at present, is not provided before winter sets in on the bleak plateau, the mortality among the enemy’s camels will be even greater than among his horses. An encounter is reported to have taken place at el-Ghaymar ( ?) (stated by King Husein to be west of Aneizah and south-west of Boreidah), between a force under Turki, son of the Emir of Riyadh, and a mixed body of Abdah Shammar under one of the A pi sheikhs, and of some Beni Salim Harb under Ibn Nahit el-Hanafiyah. The first force is affirmed by King Husein to have been the assailant, and the latter to have been friendlies, not Rashidite adherents, as Turki pretended. They were indeed, he says, operating against the Emir of Hail. We do not know the truth of this matter, or the precise location of the fight (can it be el-Gathmar, 280 miles from Mecca and about 200 from Boreidah, on the Sudani road between these towns) ? But it has caused the King to reaffirm his suspicions of Ibn Sand. Beyond compensating families of victims, however, he says he will take no action. Twenty men were killed. Ibn Ajil and Ibn Aahit have since arrived in Mecca. A report of the recent Pilgrimage will be issued later, i he total number of pilgrims, who went to Arafat this year, is stated to have been 70,000, inclusive of 30,000 from Nejd and Yemen,_ 401 — i • v hardly anyone came last year.

Ten horses and thirteen riding camels accompanied them as presents to King Husein. The latter had a camp prepared two marches from Mecca and personally received the party on arrival. On its departure after the Pilgrimage, it received lavish presents, and the Emir Mohammed has expressed great gratification at the treatment accorded to him. The latter, however, is not a man of much intelligence or weight with his brother ; and we must not expect any great political consequence from this intercourse. [ Later News .—There are indications that Hauran Druses and Ruwallah are about to attack the railway near Deraa. Scurvy is serious on the L. of C., South of Medain Salih. The fuel question has become worse owing to interruption of supplies from Hish, and the food difficulty, on the L. of C., South of el-Ala, is almost as serious. The Circassian Regiment has been sent up from Tebuk to Maan.] The following report on his raid has been furnished by Major Lawrence, C.B. :— I left Akaba on September 7, with the two British gun instructors, and two Sheikhs of the Ageilat Beni Atiyah, from Mudowarrah. My hope was to raise 300 men in Gfueira and take M udo w arrah stati on. We rode gently to Gfueira, where were a large camp, little water, and great tribal heartburnings. The three sub-tribes I was relying on were not yet paid, and Audah abu Tayi was making trouble by his greediness and his attempt to assume authority over all the Huweitat. It was impossible to get either men or camels, so I moved to Rum, five hours S.S.E. of Gfueira. There are good springs, difficult of access, at Rum, some pasturage, and the most beatiful sandstone cliff scenery. At Rum the Dhumaniyah came in on September 12, muti nous. The situation became unpleasant, so I. rode to Akaba, saw Eeisal, and returned on the loth with the promise of twenty baggage camels, and Sherif Abdullah ibn Hamza el-Feir, who tried to smooth over the local friction.— 402 On September 15 the camels arrived, and on the 16th we started for Mudowarrah with a force of 116 Bedouins, made up of Toweiha, Zuweida, Darausha, Dhumaniyah, Togatga and Zelebani Huweitat, and Ageilat Beni Atiyah. Sheikh Zaal was the only capable leader, and Audah’s pretensions had made the other sub-tribes determined not to accept his authority. This threw upon me a great deal of detailed work, for which I had no qualifications, and throughout the expedition I had more preoc cupation with questions of supply and transport, tribal pay, disputes, division of spoil, feuds, march order, and the like, than with the explosive work which should more properly have been mine. The Sherif with me, Nash* el-Harith, went blind the first day out and w 7 as useless. We reached Mudowarrah well on September 17, in the after noon, after thirteen hours march and went down at dusk to the station about three miles further east. We got within oOO yards of it, but could find no position for a Stokes gun. The station is large and the garrison seemed to be between 200 and 300 men, and I was doubtful whether it would be wise to take it on with the rather mixed force I had ; so in the end I went back to the well and on the 18th moved southward into sandy country. It is hoped to make Mudowarrah the object of further operations. In the afternoon of September 18, I laid an electric mine, in about five hours work, over a culvert at kilo. 587, on the outside of a curve towards some low hills, 300 yards away, where Stokes and Lewis guns could be placed to rake the lengths of either north-or south-bound trains. The position was too high for the best machine-gun wmrk, but the presence of a British machine- gunner made safety play advisable. We slept near the mine, but were seen by a Turkish watch ing post near kilo. 590 in the afternoon, and at 9 a.m. on the 19th about forty men were sent from Haret Ammar ( = Kalaat el-Ahmar on map Maan 1: 500,000) to attack us from the south, where the hills were broken and difficult to keep clear. We detached thirty men to check them, and waited till noon, when a force of about 100 men moved out from Mudowarrah and came slowly down the line, to outflank us on the north. At 1 p.m. a train of two engines and two box-wagons came up slowly from the south, shooting hard at us from loopholes and positions on the carriage roofs. As it passed I exploded the mine under the second engine, hoping the first would then go through the culvert. the Lewis guns cleared the roof meanwhile. The mine derailed the front engine, smashing its cab and tender, destroyed the second engine altogether, and blew in the culvert. The first wagon upended into the Vhole and the succeeding ones were shaken up. The shock affected the Turks, and the Arabs promptly charged up to within twenty yards, and fired at the wagons, which were not armoured. The Turks got out on the far side, and took refuge in the hollow of the bank '(about eleven feet high) and fired between the wheels— 403 — a , „s Two Stokes bombs at once fell among them there and turned them out towards some rough country 200 yards N.E. o t e line On their way there the Lewis gun killed all but abou twenty of them, and the survivors threw away their rifles and fled towards Mudowarrah. The action took ten minutes. The Arabs now plundered the train, while I fired a box of p-uncotton on the front engine and damaged it more extensively. T fear however, that it is still capable of repair. 1 he conditions were not helpful to good work, for there were many prisoners and women hanging on to me, 1 had to keep the peace among the plunderers, and the Turks from the south opened fire on us at Ion o’ ranoe just as the train surrendered, our covering force on that sale having come in to share the booty. The baggage in the train was very large and the Arabs went mad over it, In any case a Bedouin force no longer exists when plunder has been obtained, since each man only cnies to get^off home with it. I was therefore left with the two British X.C.O.’s and Zaal and Howeimil of the Arabs, to ensure the safety of the guns and machine o-uns. It was impossible to complete the destruction of the first engine or burn the trucks. We destroyed twenty rounds of Stokes shells and some S.A.A. whose detonation kept back the Turks for a time. The north and south Turkish forces were both coming up fast, and our road back was commanded by hills which they were already occupying. 1 abandoned my own bag gage and got away the men and guns to a safe position in the rear. Zaal was there able to collect thirteen men, and at 3 p.m. we counter-attacked the hills and regained our camping ground. We then managed to clear off most of the kit, though some of it, in the most exposed positions, had to be left. Sergeant Yells came up with a Lewis, and we retired ridge by ridge from 4’30 p.m. with no losses except four camels. The Turkish killed amounted to about seventy men, with about thirty wounded (of whom many died later). We took ninety prisoners, of whom live were Egyptian soldiers captured by the Turks near Hadiyah, ten were women, and nine were Medina men, deported by the Turks. An Austrian Second Lieut., who (with about thirteen Sergeant Instructors) was on the train, was killed : only sixty-eight of the prisoners were brought into Akaba. From 5 p.m. we rode hard northward, and on to Mudowar rah well, at 8 p.m. We watered that night, without interruption from the Turks, which was good fortune, for the station is only three miles away and the Arab camels were so loaded with booty as to be useless for a fight. We left the same evening, and got to B um on the night of September 20. The promptness of the Turkish attack, the smallness of my force, and the amount of spoil made our retreat inevitable. I had hoped to hold up the line for a considerable time, and still hope that, with proper arrangements, it may be possible. The country about Mudowarrali (whose station well is, I feel sure, the key ofthe Maan-Tebuk railway) is so bare of grazing, that the mainten ance of a large blockading force is not feasible ; but the water difficulties for the Turks make a heavy attack by them, if Mudowarrah is once lost, improbable. The Arab casualties were one killed and four wounded. The mine was a sandbag of fifty pounds of blasting gelatine kneaded into one lump. It was set between the ends of two steel sleepers, in contact with each and with the base of the rail. Four inches of sand and ballast was laid over it. The spot chosen was over the south haunch of a three-metre arched culvert, and the contact wires were buried down the embankment, across a hollow, and up a low rocky ridge beyond. A naval waterproof detonator was used, as army detonators were not available. 1. he burying of the contact wire took nearly four hours, since stiff single wires were supplied. A very light twin cable would be more use. It ] roved extremely difficult (on the score of weight) to carry off the wires after use. The length of cable available was 200 yards, but for reasons of observation I had to stand at 100 yards only. I he shock of the explosion was very severe, and parts of cylinders, wheels, pistons and boiler plating fell all over the place to a radius of 300 yards from the locomotive. The whole side of the engine was blown off and half the culvert brought down. People in the trucks complained of shock. Had I fired the mine under the front engine I think both would have been wrecked. One was a Hejaz locomotive and one a D.H.P. (Damascus—Aleppo Railway). LIBYA. Situation in Cyrenaica. The period, which has elapsed since the publication of the remarks in Bulletin Ho. 58 (p. 327), has permitted Libyan affairs ^ to assume a clearer shape ; and contact, maintained with Idris by means of correspondence during the past few months, has served to clear up several obscure points of the political and military situation in his country. The outstanding event has undoubtedly been Idris’s capture of the Turkish contingent at Gedabia, reported in Bulletin Ho. 61 (p 363) The most important of his prisoners, including the redoubtable Musa Pasha el-Yemeni, have now been sent under escort to Kufra. This action on the part of Idris, being at variance with the conditions of Article 2 of our Agreement with him whereby he has undertaken either to hand over all lurkish prisoners of war to us or to expel them from Africa altogether, has evoked a protest from the Italians who have asked that Idris should be compelled to observe strictly the above mentioned conditions. An official letter has been sent from Cairo to^ 1 Viim on his exploit at Gedabia and asking Idris, congra ai a _ b pr0 p 0 ses to take to observe the conditions r vn d ? P Mea-Ue iaHs reports, that there are .several Turkish iutrip- tT’rzrs Sen “ariivi^ at Akrama near Tobruk in the middle of September. He appears to entertain serious apprehensions about the powers , f these intriguers, and his efforts to combat their propaganda have undoubtedly been very seriously handicapped by a certain action on the part of the Italians. At the shortest notice an Italian “Customs Post was established on August 23 at a well called M sead, lour miles due west of Solium. The local Bedouins at Sollnm strongly resented this move and their resentment would undoubtedly have developed into active opposition, had not haled el-Homn the wakil of Idris, happened to be on a visit to Solium at the time. Strong representations were made to him that no armed Bedouins could be allowed to congregate on our borders, and eventually he sent orders in Idris’s name, to all Bedouins to disperse. Since then the situation has continued quiet. Idris’s personal views on this Post, as expressed in letters to the Italian Governor of Bemdiazi and’ to the High Commissioner, indicate very strong resentment indeed, and he refuses to accept the Italian explanation that the post was similar to others established by Idris himself west of Gedabia. He complains, that it is impossible to make his Bedouins believe that the establishment of this Post is necessary; furthermore, that its existence greatly strengthens the case made out against him by the above mentioned Turkish intriguers, who will now accuse him of having sold his territory to the Italians. It is believed that a meeting was held at Akrama in mid-September between Idris and an Italian Diplomatic Agent to discuss the whole question, but it is not yet known whether any definite decision has been arrived at. [Later news says that the result was satisfactory]. Idris is known to be anxious to get back to Gedabia, where he has inaugurated certain military measures, including two patrol lines running from the coast in a southerly direction, the most westerly one from Marsa Sultan on the Sert coast to the oasis of Sella some 150 miles south. The Italians are urging him to permit them to attach a liaison officer to his entourage, and have requested him to submit a list of names. Idris has undertaken to link up some of his posts in western Cyrenaica with the Italians by telephone. That Idris is still nervous about the Lurkish influence opposed to him is evident from appeals which he has made for money and assistance both to the Italians and ourselves ; the latter request was conveyed by a special delegate, who was recently interviewed by the High Commissioner. Idris complains especially of supplies reaching Misurata bv submarine. The Italians have expressed their willingness to assist Idris to combat the Lurkish element, especially in the Gedabia district, which is his most- 406 — vulnerable point. It remains to be seen bow far Idris will be able to counteract the insidious propaganda of the enemy in his midst, for there can be no doubt that Nuri’s agents are busy enough amongst the tribes of north Cyrenaica. In this connection, it is instructive to note that the Abeidat tribe of this region has shown signs of restlessness and is refusing, it is said, to acknow ledge Idris’ authority ; on the other hand, it is not clear whether the tribesmen are being encouraged in their attitude of semi independence by Turkish propaganda. Further west, Ramadan Shitewi still sits at Misurata and a acquires merit” from submarine arrivals. In the neighbourhood of Tripoli itself, a large Turco-Arab force, said to have been commanded by Nuri personally, with Sheikhs Sof and Suleiman Baruni in attendance, was recently reported to have been dispersed with heavy loss south of Zanzur, by an Italian column under General Cassinis. But later information tends to discount the first report of this affair. NOTES. Turks outside Medina. Miralai Abd el-Mejid Bey, now at Yambo, forwarded to Colonel Wilson, in the middle of September, a chart of the Turkish dispositions round Medina. The chart had been drawn without knowledge of true relative distances or directions, and is, therefore, not worth reproduction ; but the posts indicated on it and the strength and armaments, enumerated in a note sent with it, may be recorded. The Turks, according to this information, were holding the hills round a sort of semi-circle, with flattened ends, from Ihrel-Manjur, W. of the city, to the springs of el-Ayun on the S.E. (F. of Awali). This semi-circle leaves to the S. Bir Derwish, where All’s H.Q. are, but includes Bir el-Mashi, which is faced from the south by Zeid’s H.Q. There are seven hill-posts m al . (1) S. of Sir el- Manjur, where is a fortified camp ; J. Abuar Ali, S. of the fortified camp of Abyar All; here is 3/52nd Regt. (reserve); (3) J. Umm Euqba with a Q F Schneider 7-5 gun and two Q.F. Mantelli 8'7 guns; (4) hill above RzrtfZ Idurad, facing Bir Derwish ; here is l/52nd Regt. and a fortifie camp; (5) two points S.W. and S. of Bir el-Mashi held respectively by 3/42nd Regt. and l/42nd Regt., whose fortified camp is at Bir el-Mashi ; (6) near dwaK which with (, el-Ayun and the intervening space, are held by 2/42nd Regt. with camp at el-Ayun. Except at No. 3 the guns are ordinary mountain, about twenty-one in all, with about twenty machine guns. 4 e— 407 — , • 700.

The following interesting experience of the difficulties of effective railway ^demolition is contributed by Lieut.-Colonel S. F. Newcombe, D.S.O. i * • i u • + onn “On July 6 , Capt. Hornby and Aziz ei-Hamawi cut 300 rails north of Mabruk en-Naqa, on a straight piece of line. The line ’was inspected and most of the rails were found to be broken, nieces six inches long being knocked out of the top flange. Subsequently, however, an engine with several trucks passed over this broken track. The train rolled from sidetoside butno vehicle left the rails. Capt. Hornby saw it, and was unable to get the men with him to attack. Later on, both the fii email and the driver deserted. They stated that they had been punished by the Turks, who accused them of trying to damage the train by running over the broken rails. I hey weie so augeied by this injustice, when they had done their best, that they deserted. Had the breaks been on the curve instead of on the straight, the train would certainly have been derailed. The fireman stated that, had the Arabs attacked, the train would have surrendered as there were only two or three armed men on it. As it was, thev were able to run unmolested to Abu Taqa station. The driver was present when this line was repaired, and he said that only 218 rails were replaced. Damaged rails, slightly bent, were not touched ; and only those with the flange actually cut were removed. Also any pieces longer than five metres are always used a (min. Therefore, it is essential to cut at the centre of the rail.” ‘ News of A nazeh Tribes. Two satisfactory signs of Nuri Shaalan’s attitude towards the King of the Hejaz and ourselves have come to hand during the past week. One is an agreement, authoritatively reported, that, during Anri’s absence from Jauf on business of the Kings, a Sherifian artillery detachment shall guard the oasis against Rashidite attack. Ceylon mountain guns are asked for as the armament of the detachment. The other sign is a request from Anri, transmitted through Major Lawrence, that half his tribe, the Ruwallah, should he allowed to supply itself from some Mesopotamian market, controlled by us. He states that the usual supplies of Hauran corn have been headed off, presumably by theiwi cot 1 &gt;£k lit litlybt,®' 4 cot® ^ areal® e centre ft a. — 408 — Turks, from his tribesmen, owing to the latter showing their hand too soon. Nuri’s request has been referred to Baghdad. Bagdhad telegraphed on September 24, that a Muzeiri Ubidah sheikh, whq had come down from near Meskineh, has reported his tribe, the Seba, to be moving south to avoid the Turks, who are oppressing ail the Anazeh in revenge for the defection of the A mar at under Fahad Hadhdhal. The sheikh’s own sectional chief, Barjis ibn Hudeib, was coming down eastward of Anderin towards Sukhneh en route for the Qaarah district west of Hit. As he will cross the tracks from Tadmur to Deir and Hit, he will be able to inform Fahad about the truth of recent reports of the use of Tadmur as a base by the Turks and of their project for passing large bodies of troops across from Homs to the Euphrates by that place. The Fedaan are stated by the same sheikh to be moving in the same direction and for the same reason as the Seba. Under their new Paramount Chief, Mudhim ibn Turki, who, on attaining majority, has superseded the well known Hachim Muheid, they propose to stay at present in the Shamiyah desert about Qaarah. Fahad Hadhdhal had reported their intention already to Baghdad, and presumably it was submitted by the Fedaan to his approval. Hachim Muheid is said to have retired east of the Euphrates into the Belikh valley, where he is camping with no .more than a tent or two. The relations, however, between Fahad and Nuri Shaalan are not yet adjusted, and will not be till the latter renounces publicly his pretension to be paramount over all the Anazeh. At present Nuri expresses a wish not to be beholden in any way to Fahad in the procuring of supplies for his Ruwallah from a Euphrates source. If, however, Fahad gathers to himself the alliance of the Fedaan and Seba, Nuri will probably see reason : and if the former chief helps us on the Euphrates line and the latter helps King Husein, we ought to able to bring about some agreement. Yemen awl Aden News. Sheikh Mohammed Hassan of Mirab, who is one of the holiest Shafei chiefs in the Taiz district and southern Tihamah, has suffered a set-back at the hands of the Turks, who are reported to have occupied Mirab and driven him to flight. Since, however, he is son-in-law of the powerful Sheikh of Udein and is opposed very unwillingly by Sunni tribesmen, even if these are Turcophil, we have probably not heard the last of him and he is still worth our support. The matter of the murder of Abu Has seems to have been settled temporarily on the terms mentioned on page 384, the Dhu Mohammed and Dhu Husein envoys having agreed to consult their tribesmen and in any case observe a truce till after the Bairam just past. The majority of their followers— 409 — , c xTolrlikn via Yerim, for the feast. The Imam rreporTa toTave made’once more public proclamation of his ^We^e beeif supporting Abd el-Kadir, grandson of the „ , o U Kvt thv despatch of: a warship to bhukrah on Smber 27 ”’with fifty troops, against a reported Turkish design to abduct him. Our soldiers were welcomed by Abd el-Kadir on Jerba Shammar. Baghdad telegraphed, on October 1, that Abdul Aziz ibn Tertian °of the Jerba Shammar had entered the aiea of om occu- nation and been received by us His brother, Fe.sal, has been to Mecca for the Pilgrimage, and there declared lus adherence to Kiim Husein’s cause. He has now left for Zeid s camp and will probably go on to Abdullah and home via Teuna. Abdul Aziz and Feisal are sons of the late Ferhan Pasha by his second wife, a Tayi woman. Asi, a son by the first wife (of A mud stock), was made by the Turks responsible chief of the jerba Shammar in 1911, and presumably he retains that position. What influence these half-brothers of his, Abdul Aziz and Feisal, may wield with the tribe is not known to Cairo ; but it is^ worth noting that their connection, on the distaff side, with the Tayi— who rano’e in north-west Mesopotamia and could interfere with Ovo RonCrWl rail wav west of Tell Halif—might prove of value to us. The Jerba are the leading section of the northern Shammar, ^ by far the strongest of the Mesopotamian nomad tribes. Che Jerba Sheikh, whose nobility dates back to pre-Mohammedan times, is regarded as Paramount Chief of the whole tribe, about whose°numbers great diversity of opinion prevails ; pro bably at a pinch it could muster 8,000 fighting men. It ranges over all Eastern and Central Mesopotamia proper, from north of Mosul to the neighbourhood of Samarra, and across to Deir ez-Zor, with a sort of tribal metropolis at el-Hadr, west of Qalah Sherghat. It is, therefore, in a position to interfere with communications, not only on both the Tigris and Euphrates lines, but also on the cross-line Ivy the Baghdad railway in the north. Some months ago, after a German engineer had been found murdered on the road between Qalah Sherghat and Tekrit, the G. 0. C., Mosul, showed much solicitude about the attitude of the Jerba Shammar and directed the despatch of presents to el-Hadr. Ferhan was out against the Turks all his life, as also was his brother, Fails, though eventually both accepted the title, Pasha. Even if some of Ferhan’s sixteen surviving sons, like Asi and Humeidi, have accepted a mediatized position, the family tradition is to fight Turks.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000228_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/657</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000228</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/657</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 756/1917 Pt 1 ‘ARAB BULLETIN Nos 1 to 65’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-30T10:16:50</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (616 folios)</extent><extent>The bulletins are arranged in numerical order from the front to the back of the file.
