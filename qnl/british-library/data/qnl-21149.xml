Memorandum s io zti, ut mo irfs iBi .SI iai m *« In order to enable the Transport Authorities to arrange adequate shipping space for the requirements of Bahrain, thehave asked that a programme should be drawn up showing the requirements of Bahrain (including transit trade) moi*th by month for the remaining portion of 1941. This will be alluded to as the Requirements Programme and will be sent in the form of a single statement. 2. I should therefore be most grateful if the Customs authorities here could kindly assist by letting me have material to enable me to draw up the above Requirements Programme. The details required are (a) anproximate total in tons for each month beginning with July (b) the proportion of this tonnage coming from any of the following* loading areas s- (i) North America Atlantic-Florida (ii) Gulf and West Indies (iii) South American East Coast (iv) Spain, Portugal, Canaries (v) West Africa excepting Cape Town (vi) East Africa Cape Town Mombasa including Mauritius (vii) (a) Karachi, Bombay and Western India (b) Burma s Calcutta East Coast, and Ceylon.

I attach a specimen of the information required* These details for all the remaining months of the year may kindly be supplied to me as early as possible. 3. In addition, to supplement the above programme, the Transport Authorities require to know, month by month in advance, exactly what tonnage of cargo may be expected to be shipped for Bahrain. These details will include the name of the port of loading, details of the commodity, names of consignor, consignee, shipping agent, weight in tons and any other details, with sufficient indication to permit identifi cation. These details are required to enable me to compile a monthly Loading Programme and shipping representatives will be instructed to load for Bahrain only cargo so specified. I should be grateful if you could kindly let me have the figures for July and August as soon as possible. The figures for September may Aiindly be sent to me by the end of July, for October at the end of August and so on. 4. I do not know if the Bahrain Petroleum Company have any separate arrangement for obtaining their requirements by tanker but if they have I would be grateful if your figures could also include imports by them. 5.

S.Z Adviser to the GovernmeA w a 1 1, July 7, 1941. CON-856 Mr.C.Dalrymple Belgrave, C.B.E., Advisor to the Government, Bahrein. V) Bear Sir, T ?ith reference to your letter dated July 3rd requesting information with regard to Company’s Imports into Bahrein in accordance with copy of letter c/698-la/48, dated July 1st from H.B.'-’s Political Agent, Bahrein. We are forwarding for your information a detailed estimate prepared covering our estimated purchases for the next twelve month 3 commencing July 1941. This estimate was compiled in accordance with instructions from our New York Office to meet the requirements of the British Purchasing Commission in New York and of the pet roleum Board in London. After completion of the estimate we received advice that the Petroleum Board desired this information quarterly, and in view of the urgency with which this information required we informed our New York Office to divide the figures given by four in order to ascertain the estimated purchases during the quarter from July to September, and we will, in future, prepare estimates quarterly commencinp with the quarter from October to December. T In addition to the above we ha\B been requested to submit a quarterly cable detailing in tons the estimated purchase of material classified as per attached cable dated June 14, which information we cabled on June £5 as per copy attached. As requested we have studied the letter forwarded from H.B.M’s Political Agent and offer for consideration our comments under respective headings, with a view to affording every possible assist ance which racy, result in the desired information being prepared as accurately a^possible. ^ y H.B.M’s Political Agent requested Tonnage figures cover ing ^^quirement Programme end Loading Programme covering the months of July and August should be forwarded as soon as possible, we have given information available for the above months under res pective headings. Similar figures are requested for the month of September at the end of July, October at the end of August, and so on. For reasons which we trust will be apparent after reading the attached, we await further instructions before submitting these figures in view of possible modification which may be made after consideration of attached.- 2 - Although not requested by H.B.M’s Political Ag'ent, we have given, under the heading of Local Purchase, details of estimated purchases locally not covered by Company Foreign orders, for inclusion in general tonnage figures for Bahrein. CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED EWGREQ,liIREMENrs PROGRAMME. Information is requested detailing month by month Tonnage which will arrive in Bahrein for Company operations. In our opinion we are not in a position to furnish this infor mation with a sufficient degree of accuracy which would enable the Transport authorities to allocate shipping space month by month commencing with July, due to the following: Three factors are involved to enable an estimate to be prepared regarding arrival date of material in Bahrein. 1. Period of transmital of the order to our purchasing agents in our main sources of supply, i.e. India, U.K. South Africa and the United States. In each case this will vary depending whether the order is mailed or cabled, which in turn will depend on the degree of urgency at the time order is pre pared, this cannot be definitely determined in advance due to circumstances associated with operations here and the continual fluctuation of the delivery period. 2. Actual period for shipment from Loading Port, which in the case of the United States end the U.K. is averaged at two months, India, one week; South Africa, three weeks. 3. The last and most important factor affecting this esti- mete is the actual period of delivery from the factory. As you are doubtless aware Export Licences have been required for some time covering the export of certain commodities when exported from the United Kingdom and India, during recent months this has also been applicable to certain exports from the United States in conjunction with a system of priority delivery, in this connec tion we attach sheets detailing information with regard to deli very of material compiled by our Purchasing Agent in the United States. This factor of delivery is one which we cannot determine here in Bahrein and as this period varies by nine months or longer, we cannot predict with any degree of accuracy arrival of tonnage month by month in Bahrein represented by orders forwarded from here and executed in the United States, which still continues to be the main source of supply notwithstanding our attempts to obtain supplies or substitutes from Sterling Countries. Although we have quoted the United States as an example representing the main tonnage involved, it will be appreciated that this is also applicable to the United Kingdom and other countries exporting. To summarise the above due to the unknown factor of delivery varying by nine months, we cannot accurately estimate here in' Bahrein tonnage arrival month by month, this factor is the most important one with regard to estimate of arrival in Bahrein which only our Purchasing Agent can provide after receipt of the Order.- 2 - RE^JIBSMSNTS FROGR;A!M£. It Is noted that figures for July and August are re quired as soon as possible; for September at the end of July; covering October at the end of August, and so on. May we suggest that, even if we were in a position to give this information accurately, in the case of shipments originating from the United Kingdom and the United States - which will comprise the main tonnage likely to be involved - material scheduled to arrive in Bahrein by October will already have been shipped at the end of August, date information is requested, allowing two months as the average period for actual shipment. For reasons which we have already detailed under, Delivery Period page 1 para. 3, we regret we have very incomplete information available to comply with the request to detail approximate tonnage scheduled to arrive in Bahrein during July and August under heading 'A', as requested in 'B', proportion of tonnage from Loading Areas. We detail below all the available information we have in our possession, and suggest it will be realised, after examina tion, why we are not in a position to list and segregate as requested by H.B.M* s Agent.

In the hope that it will prove to be of assistance, although not requested, we attach a detailed tonnage statement listing by Loading Areas as above, our receipts for 1940 and 1941 to date. Although not a direct medium of comparison, as a rough indi cation of tonnage trend, our valuation of estimated purchases during the next twelve months in relation to purchases in 1940 is approximately one-third lower. Quoting from Page 2 of letter from H.B.M’s Political ^gent - 'Items having priority other than on grounds of need or political importance should be shown separately' - Assuming continu ity of supply from the Bahrein Refinery may be regarded as essential, and taking into consideration the fact that nothing will be ordered during the next twelve months which is not considered to be essential for the maintenance of operations here, is it possible to regard tonnage represented by Company orders in the category of priority 'other than on ground of need or political importance'. LOADING PROGRAMME : It is stated that shipping representatives will be instructed to load for Bahrein only cargo covered by Tonnage to be given under this heading, with sufficient details to permit identi fication, following is our comment on the most important point involved. 'ort of Loading. Ye are not in a position to give any details regard- ing Port of Loading for any material shipped from England. With regard to shipment from the United States we have no definite informa tion in the majority of cases before material is shipped. We can only conjecture based on previous shipments from which port, or Loading Area, material is likely to be shipped viiich we assume for the purpose of this programme is not sufficiently accurate, we quote the two following recent examples, supplies of lubricating oil, grease, etc., were in the past shipped from New York, Loading Area (1), cabled advice has now been received stating that due to Govern ment regulations consignments falling in this classiciation will not in future be shipped from Atlantic Coast. Clarification Clay used in bulk for Refinery operation has in the past been loaded in the Gulf Loading Area (2) and shipped from New York Area (1), we have been informed by cable that there is an outstanding order for 850 tons awaiting shipping opportunity from the Gulf direct.

We are not in a position to give any details regard ing port of Loading for any material shipped from England, With regard to shipment from the United States we have no definite informa tion in the majority of cases before material is shipped. tfe can only conjecture based on previous shipments from which port, or Loading Area, material is likely to be shipped vhich we assume for the purpose of this programme is not sufficiently accurate. *Ve quote the two following recent examples, supplies of lubricating oil, grease, etc. were in the past shipped from New York, Loading Area (1), cabled advice has now been received stating that due to Govern ment regulations consignments falling in this classification will not in future be shipped from Atlantic Coast.

With regard to the Requirements Programme, I think the Company are aiming at a degree of accuracy which under the cir cumstances it is not possible to reach* What is required as regards the Requirement Programme is only an approximat e estimate of the number of tons likely to be required for the remaining portion of 1941, This should be split up as far as possible among the remaining months of the year. The Company must be aware of what orders have been placed which are likely to be shipped during the remainder of 1941 and it will only be necessary to divide this out amongst the months in which consignments may reasonably be expected to be shipped. Even the roughest estimate will be useful provided it is tabulated in the form required and I hope it will be possible for the Company to do this, 3, As regards the Loading Programme, In this connection accuracy cannot be hoped for but if the Company can give some intimation in advance of tonnage^ likely to be shipped during the month in question and some idea of the area, if not the exact port from which it is likely to be shipped, the requirements of the Transport Authorities will have been met as far as cir cumstances permit.

MBIIORAJTIUM: - THE CUSTOr/HCUBE: BAHRAIN 31st July, 1941., 8th Rajah, 136G., Singapori Coffe being cheaper than the quality ^nown as 'Native* is in great demand in the local market. The present position of stock of Singapori Coffee is as follows With Birect Importers. 280 bags. ‘With Wholesalers. 120 bags. Total:- 400 bags. This quantity will last us for about tv/o months. In view of the low stock Messrs Dharaanmal Isardas have recently imported 100 bags from D*bai, and request that the selling rate may be revised according to the prime cost of this consignment as was done in case of Messrs Aujan Bros when a consign ment of 100 tins of Holandi Vegetable Ghee was imported oy them from D’bai. quoting this oonsignment yere ^Xihely., the two case consignments Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas are quite correct in instance, but they are unaware of the fact that the in question was imported when no fresh consignments .tQ„_re,a&lt;ch,Baiirain uirect J^rom SQurc im In my opinion a differ. Orders have already been placed and fresh of Singapori are expected to arrive Bahrain from source of_j|ep.temper. But, if, by chance the shipments are :e owing, to some reason T or. other there will be no as we have plenty or Native &amp; plantation Coifee Ln stock. The prime cost of Singapori Coffee recently imported cy Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas is Rs;21-5-0 per naund of 56 lbs which is much higher than the price quoted at source. If, after allowing the usual margin of lo^, the selling rate is revised, there will be a rise of eight annas per 'uba over the existing rate, hich will mean a very large profit ,o the importers. In other Gulf Ports where there is no price control irices are much higher than in Bahrain. The principle adopted .ere is that market prices are based on the cost of the latest mport of a. commodity into Bahrain. If local merchants find that &gt;y importing a few cases or bags of some commodity from another hlf Port they can cause the market price to rise many of them will eliberately import goods from places where the prices are high in rder to raise the market selling price of their stocks. Under the circumstances I consider that merchants should ot be encouraged to import goods from Gulf P 0 rts except in case of cute shortages. I am of the opinion that in the interest of the onsumers it would be fair if the revision of rates of Singapori offee is postponed until the arrival of fresh consignments from source I shall be glad to have your views on the above. i’OOD CONTROL SR.

' * + V, T ^ is £ as already been submitted to His Highness ?+t er v f ? r 4 . hlS ^P 1 ^ 1011 which, as will be seen from the attached translation of his reply, is somewhat non- committal. tfith the exception of cement, which generally now comes by sailing craft from Port Okha, the needs of Bahrain are being served by steamers fairly regularly and up to date there is no need to rely upon the service of native craft, which involves more risk of loss to the importer than the steamers’ service. Therefore I do not feel that the matter is really urgent; but rather that importers would like to gain a little more profit than at present. It must be remembered that the great majority of the papulation of this State are very poor, and since the out-break of war the cost of foodstuffs has increased by about 125$. Hence I feel that the burden of this increase ought not to be borne entirely by the poor, and that the Food Control does not exist so much for the benefit of the merchants as for the protection of the poor.

EMORANDUMi- It has been reported to me by Mr Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakroo f Maharaq that, in consequence of the position in Tehran much .awlessness has broken out in Southern Persia, e.g. in Laris tan ,nd particularly in the Persian Makran. ’ Native craft carrying imports and exports to and from tasra, Kuwait, and Karachi, and Bahrain, proceed along closely to ,he Persian coast; and often on account of weather, and to obtain .rinking water, put in at the various smaller Persian ports as 'ar as Chioa and Kalat, whence they sail across the Gulf to the .rabian side. At these small ports such craft are visited by armed local ribesmen who loot valuables from the crew and passangers, and steal uch foodstuffs as are possible. The port of Chiroo is becoming otorious for these practices, which, so far as I understand, do not .ppear to occur upon the high seas. In view of this situation, I am told that the Ruler of uwait, with the concurrence of H.B.M's Political Agent there, has rdered his subjects, whose traffic in deep-water craft is both .umerous and extensive, to defend themselves by carrying two rifles nd a suitable quantity »of ammunition in each craft. Mr Ahmed Fakroo asKb uhao similar orders may do given i&gt;o ahrain craft ( of whom his family own a fair number) for their wn protection while passing the Makran and Persian coasts. I I would be glad if you would kindly advise me as to the uitable action to be taken in this position, as during the coming inter, it is possible that the local food situation will require he services of local craft rather more than previously, please. i ■ i ft jjl p7/.

Turkey and Syria we anticipate very considerable increased traffic through Persian Gulf ports. (2) Apart from steps which are 'being taken to develop port and Inland transport facilities in which we hope you will take an active interest it seems very desirable to establish a War Transport Committee at Basra on lines of Central Conmittee at Alexandria which controls all Red Sea Palestine and Egyptian ports. (3) Sphere of action of proposed committee would be Basra Khorramshahr Abadan and Bandar Shahpur. Also Urn Qasr and Kuwait if developed. (4) Its duties would be to (a)receive particulars of ships and their cargoes local and in transit especially to U.S.S.R. Ministry of War Transport will arrange for supply of information on civil cargoes as far in advance as possible.

With reference to your telegram No. 1025 of the 5th October 1941 regarding the proposed War Transport Committee to be established at Basra, I have the honour to report that this Committee commenced its meetings on the 23rd October and that Mr.W.H.Lock assumed his duties as representative of the Ministry of War Transport for Iraq and Iran on the same date. 2. I enclose a copy of the Committee^ terms of reference which were approved by the General Officer Commanding and the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation representative in Iraq and myself. I discussed them with Mr.MacTier who secured tne agreement oi the various authorities concerned without any difficulty. It will be noted that the Iraqi State Railways are not represented on the Committee. This may seem strange in view of the important part they play in the movement of goods inland from Basra. It was decided to exlude them for reasons ol secrecy, but it has been arranged for the Committee to keep the Director-General of Railways fully informed of developments of interest to him, and the Committee will keep in close touch with his representative in Basra. 3. I welcome the formation of the Basra Committee, as it is clear that it will be able to deal effectively with pro blems which could not be handled by the Bagdad Angb-Ir&amp;qi Committee for the Co-ordination of Transport. I understand that the committee is already working smoothly and efficiently and that Mr.Lock has established very cordial relations with the Port Director in particular. 4. With regard to the Bagdad Committee for the Co-ordina tion of Transport, Mr.MacTier agrees that this should be left in abeyance until problems with which it can usefully deal arise. At present matters which might be ref/erred to such a Conmittee are being expeditiously dealt with by direct negotiation between the parties concerned. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty^ Representatives at Cairo (with a copy for the Minister of State), Ankara and Tehran, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Speai's Mission, the Government of India, the Department of Overseas Trade and His Majesty's Consul at Basra.

The Committee will co-ordinate the operation of discharge and loading of ships and Port clearance with a view to tiie most rapid turn-round of ships and distribution of cargo. 6. The Committee will receive information and will advise regarding the development of Port and Inland transport facilities. 7. Nothing in the above will prevent priority being given to any Service operational requirements; subject to this, the Committee will be collectively responsible for its decisions and in the event of dispute the matter shall be referred through the Chairman to the Ministry of War Transport, iiondon, who will undertake to obtain a decision by reference to the Departments concerned. 8. Appropriate matters can be discussed with the Iraqi authorities through the Anglo-Iraqi Advisory Committee for co-ordination of Transport of which the Chairman of the War Transport Executive Committee is a member.

The retail prices to the public are, of course, published; hut general gossip indicates that there is wide-spread profiteering in the bazars, which causes particular hardship upon the poorer and illiterate folk to whom sales are refused unless the price demanded is paid, whatever may be the controlled price. Also, the wholesalers (whose business it is to sell) readily sell their goods to anybody, whether he may or may not be a recognised sh&amp;p-keeper. Consequently it is possible to buy in quantity and hoard up same in expectation that the price will rise later on, which it invariably does. Thus we have the local position of hoarders withdrawing from the bazar goods which ought to be in sale, and retailers refusing to sell except at a 'profiteering' price. I instance some recent purchases of sugar by non-retailers, i.e. hoarders: 2. Muhummad Saleh Sainey, clerk of S.H.Bassam. 3. Muhummad Said Khadim, Persian carpet dealer 4. Mahmud Ismail, watch dealer, Abbas Aly Aly Reza,.. carpet seller, 6. Ebrahim Mahmud Awazy, cloth siller 7. Muhummad Jumal Khunjy, cloth dealer, 8.

Dscsmhsi’j 1^/41 • t in which I sought for oowsr to control hoarding and refusal to sell controlled commodities. Since the news of the stoppage of a consignment of five thousand 'bags of Java sugar intended for Bahrain has 'become general, there has been a general concelament of stocks and with-holding of sales in the bazar by the retailers, which is, of course, a bad thing for the poor people. Also, wholesalers and others have made bargains with the importers to create a 'reserve 11 stock, but have not taken delivery. This is another form of hoarding. This morning, there was not an ounce of sugar to be bought in the bazars of Manamah and Maharaq, although numerous orders to sell aad been issued on retailers. In view of this position, I had come to a friendly arrangement nth Mr Tickamdas , of Dhamanmal Isardas, an importer, for him to open a shop in Manamah and in Maharaq for sale of foodstuffs, commencing with sugar, at controlled prices direct to the public; and I am having Notice Boards prepared for exhibition which will give the controlled prices in Arabic. H.E.Shaikh Abdullah bin Easa A1 Khalifah has been of assistance In loaning a set of scales for public service. This morning I had a Town Crier announce the opening of these shops at controlled prices; and consequently all the other retailers Immediately produced their stocks and offered them for sale. For this reason I ask you for power to cancel any uncompleted bargains (i.e. where delivery has not been taken by the purchaser), md ( 2 ) to take over and sell any stock which any importer, whole-saler, &gt;r retailer refuses to sell, and arrange for such to be sold through )ther means. May I ask, please, for your early assistance in this matter, the same time I would commend to your favourable notice the public- spirited action of Mr Tickamdas.
