H.B.M 1 s Political Agent, Bahrain, # / Dear Sir, We have to report that on 1st December 1947 cheque No.295949 for the sum of Rs.65,000 was issued by this Company and cashed at the Eastern Bank Ltd., by our Cashier, C. Alberts. This sum was not paid into the Company's cash by C. Alberts. On the previous day he received a cable from India stating that his wife was dangerously ill and applied to us on 1st December in writing for one month's compassionate leave. This was granted on the 2nd December 1947 and he left for India on the 4th December 1947. The cheque, which Xs in the possession of the Eastern Bank Ltd., was signed and endorsed by Mr.B.H.Lermitte and further endorsed by C. Alberts. We are informed by the Bank that this sum was paid to Alberts in the following denominations: Rs*100 notes Rs.30,000 10 ' 30,000 1 TT 5,000 Total Rs.65,000 assssssssssas Alberts was previously employed by The Bahrein petroleum Co. Ltd. for approximately 8^ years and was locally engaged by us on 27th April 1947 on Rs.300/-. per Conisdential.• • - E - month plus a temporary allowance of SO^ and house allowance of Rs # 50/- per month. On leaving he gave as his address M Sukhvilas ,t , Udipi, S. Kanara. On 28th December 1947 he wrote from Haroon Building 3rd floor, Parel, Bombay, stating that he had 'come down to Bombay and will sail for Bahrain by the 1st available steamer after the 4th January 1948'. We had written to him at his previous address on 28th December 1947 informing him that we had instructed our agents, Messrs. Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. Ltd., Bombay, regarding his return to Bahrain. As we had no news of him, we wired A.I.O.C., Bombay, on 24th January 194 8 and received the following reply on 2nd February 1948: '12 Your BB8 Alberts not reported nor any information received will clarify and inform you' The above telegram crossed ours of the same date reading as follows: 'BBll Our BB8 and PMP/5462 please telegraph date Alberts reported you and date expected sail' It was not until the 29th February 1948 that the loss of the cash was discovered when our Qatar Accounts Depart ment were checking the Bank passbook with their cash book. The amount of Rs.65000 was drawn, we believe, by Alberts producing a copy of a previous letter authorising the withdrawal of a sum of Rso 165000, and it is to be presumed that the amount on the copy of that letter had been altered together with the date. No trace can be found of the Debit Note ?/hich is always signed at the same time as the cheque and forms the authority for debiting to the account concerned.# ~ 3 - It can only be presumed tbat this was destroyed after signature. The counterfoil of the cheque was also detached from the checkbook, presumably by Alberts. The cash could have been transferred to India in the form of a draft through one of the local merchants who undertake similar banking business. We shall be grateful if you will institute inquiries and arrange to trace Mr. C. Alberts and cause him to be brought to Bahrain so that we may take proceed ings against him for the recovery of the amount of Rs.65,000. We have heard unofficially that Alberts was seen recently in G-oa. Please inform us whether you require any further information.

Dear Dredge, I enclose copies of two letters dated VtH and 11th March which I have receive : from the Manager, Petroleum Con cessions Limited, which are self-explanatory. 2. As in the Heskail Soorani case of recent da^e, I consiiar chac similar action may be taken to arrest Mr. Alberts and bring him to Bahrain for -rial, under Sections 2 to 6 (inclusive) of the Fiagitive Offenders Act 1831. 8. There are however certain complexities in chis particular case, viz. if Mr. Alberts has fled to Goa which seerns quite pos sible from the correspondence, can the Fugitive Offenders Act be applied, or have His Majesty's Government by Treaty any other arrangements whereby fugitives may be brought to justice? If on the other hand, Mr. Alberts is in eicher of the dominions of Pakistan or India (in which case I presume that the Fugitive Offenders Act applies), it is at the same time not certain as to whe 'e exactly he is. For this reason it appears necessary to forward the full particulars of the case through either or both of the dominions of Pakistan or India so that they may take steps to arrest Mr. Alberos. 4. Accordingly, I am forwarding correspondence on the subject to you and would be grateful if y u would take whatever action you may think fit. A warrant for the arrest of Mr. Alberts when detained would have to issue under the hand of the Hon 1 ble the Political Resident, an' arrangements could be made for Police to be sent from here to bring back the fugitive. You may however wish to telegraph the authorities in India in the area of the home address of Mr. Alberts given as South Kanara, to detain him meanwhile. Yours sincerely, Major A.L.A.
