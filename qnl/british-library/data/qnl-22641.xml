Sir I have the honour to refer to your letter No:1031 dated the 22nd May 1931 and to say that the draft rules proposed appear generally suitable. I would,however,suggest that a stiff general paper in matters relating to the Persian Gulf be included in the upper division examination and that the following subjects might be included in it. 2. Use of the Indian Word and Government Telegraph Codes, knowledge of mercantile and shipping terms such as Bill of Lading, Letter of Guarantee,general average; the mode of addressing and relative ranks of Naval and Royal Air Force officers,Navy bills; rules regarding slaves and their repatriation,principles of passport work and Indian rules regarding emigrants; marine protestsjprincipal communities of the Persian Gulf and their distribution,geography of the Persian Gulf. Many other points will no doubt suggest themselves to you. 3. It is noticed that the lowed division are to have no examination since they are only to perform routine duties. Unless a clerk passes the upper division examination,itvis presumed he will rise to the top of the lower division time scale,some Rs.250/- including allowances,and would therefore certainly be given more arduous duties,so some simple test would not be out of place. At present the upper half of the caare have been placed in the Upper Division en bloc. This is no doubt inevitable upon the inauguration of a new system, though several clerks are quite unfitted for an upper division,but in the course of time itit would appear clear that the Lower Division will contain men of as long service as the Upper Division and certain minor head clerkships will presumably he filled by them* /K ^ i have the honour to be Cir^LeL Sir, cLoi^r~U l^CZi^Your Most Obedient Servant, Poetical Agent,Bahrain.NO. £6/0 1932.

M 982 British Residency and Consulate-General, , 0 ' 64/42-11 Bushire, the ]9th May 1935. From The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel T. C. FOWLE, C.B .E., . Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, SIMLA. Subject: —Exchange compensation. Sir, In view of the steady decline in the exchange value of the rupee during recent months I have the honour to submit for the consideration of the Government of India my recommendations for the grant of exchange compensation to gazetted and non-gazetted personnel employed in Iran. The question is also being considered by His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, vide copies of his telegram No. 90, dated the 2nd May 1935, and my reply. I presume that His Majesty s Minister will forward his proposals direct to the Government of India. 2. With effect from 1st November 1916 the Government of India allowed all gazetted and non-gazetted Government servants employed in Iran to draw Rs. 200 per mensem, or the whole of their salary, whichever was less, plus half the balance of their salary, if any, up to a limit of Rs. 1,000 per mensem at a privilege rate of Krans 365 per Rs. 100. Sumptuary allowance was excluded for the purpose of the limit of Rs. 1,000, and was allowed to be drawn at the privileged rate of Krans 365 per cent. In this connection a reference is invited to telegram No. 1391-Est-a, dated the 1st November 1917, from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. 3. The above concession was granted in view of the fact that the low exchange value of the rupee was incommensurate with the cost of living at the time, and some measure of relief was necessary for Government servants who had to spend a substantial portion of their salary in Iran. Since then, the cost of living has risen out of all proportion to the relative rise in the exchange value of the rupee, and if any relief is to be afforded, in view of the recent rapid decline in the latter the privileged rate will have to be raised proportionately. 4. The attached statement ' A ' shows the average monthly rates of exchange prevailing from 1917 onwards. It will be observed that the rate between 1931 and 1934, except for a few months ranged between Krans 600 and Krans 800 per Rs. 100. Since January 1935, however, the rupee has been falling steadily, the official rate for the month of May 1935 (Krans 433 per cent.) representing a decrease of income of approximately 30 per cent, as compared with the income drawn in January 1935. Recent developments in the exchange situation, local and international, point to a further decline in the exchange value of the rupee with small prospects of a rise, at any rate, in the near future. 5. The attached statements, ' B ' and ' C ', show the present cost of living in Iran, as com pared with the year 1930. Prices prevailing at the present time at Bahrain are also included for purposes of comparison. It will be observed that present prices and rates in Iran are about 77 percent, higher than those prevailing in 1930 and about 179 per cent, higher than those prevailing at Bahrain on the Arab Coast. In 1928, the Political Resident recommended to the Government of India the grant of Customs Compensation which was sanctioned in 1930, but this allowance, in itself, was insufficient to compensate Government servants for the increased cost of living caused by the heavy additional import duties and other taxes imposed by the Iranian Government since the year 1928 when the recommendation for the grant of Customs Compensation was made. The resultant hardship was to some extent mitigated by the subsequent rise in the exchange value of the rupee, particularlybetween 1931 and 1933, but the benefit derived from this rise was merely temporary and was outweighed by the abnormal rise in the cost of living, and cannot therefore be regarded as an advan tage to be set off against the present diminution of income resulting from the appreciation of the Kran. The accompanying graph illustrates clearly the extent and duration of the gain or loss resulting from the variations in the rate of exchange since 1928, considered in relation to the rise in the cost of living. The point of contact ' X ' represents the rate of exchange at which income in terms of local currency is sufficient to meet the present cost of living. The position of Government servants employed in Iran as compared with those serving on the Arab Coast will be clear from the following example An Officer of the Political Department, for instance, who is stationed at Bahrain spends locally, say, Rs. 400 per mensem. If he is transferred to any place in Iran, his expenditure, based on comparative prices, and assuming the rate of exchange to be Krans 445 per cent, will be Rs. 1,116 per mensem. Against the increased expenditure of Rs. 716 he receives Customs Compensatory allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem only, leaving a net increase of expenditure of Rs. 616 or 154 per cent, for which he is not compensated. The principle is applicable, mutatis mutandis, to Government servants of all grades. 6. It may be explained here that, though the Kran has appreciated in terms of the Rupee and Sterling, there has been no resultant drop in prices owing to the fact that the major portion of the import duty is assessed in Krans on the weight of the articles. Thus the amount of duty levied is unaffected by the fluctuations in exchange. 7. In the circumstances I am of opinion that the income of Government servants, employed in Iran should be raised, in terms of local currency, to a level more in keeping with the present high cost of living. I therefore submit the following alternative recommendations for the consideration of the Government of India :— (а) That the privileged minimum rate of Krans 365 per cent be raised to Krans 600 per cent on the terms sanctioned in the Government of India telegram cited in paragraph 2 above ; (б) that the official rate at which salaries are paid be fixed at Krans 600 per cent irrespective of exchange fluctuations. The latter proposal has the advantage of stabilising income in local currency at a level more commensurate with the cost of living, without giving undue advantage to Government employees when the rupee appreciates over Krans 600 per cent. It may be mentioned here that the local branch of the Mesopotamia-Iran Corporation Ltd., a British Commercial firm, pay their British Indian employees at a fixed rate of 600 per cent. As shown in paragraph 5 above this rate is below the level at which income in terms of local currency is sufficient to cover the present cost of living, 8. As the present exchange position is causing considerable hardship to all grades of Govern ment servants serving in Iran, I request that the Government of India will be pleased to issue very early orders in the matter. I also recommend that, in the event of my proposals being accepted, the orders should take effect from the 1 st April 1935. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obdient servant. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.u Y' (Passages referred to in Question 4.) 1. The drainage system of the city is mainly defective which is most prominently noticeable in the slum areas. The Municipality has been suggested to take up the question with the least delay for the interests of the city's health. The Chief Officer who was requested for a report on the matter reported that, apart from the deficit point of view, there are other considerations which might be found preventing while accepting the proposal to have drainage pipes laid down underground, such as the difficulties attending to the acquisition of privately owned lands and the necessity for breaking up roads upon which considerable expenditure has recently been spent. 2. In view of the facts explained above I shall be obliged if sanction could be kindly given to have these stores written off. 3. The officer in question applied for 3 months' leave with effect from the date on which he was due for retiring. It was pointed out that under the rules thq leave applied for was in admissible inasmuch the officer was not previously refused leave in the interest of public service. The leave was actually sanctioned but he did not avail of it before the date of superannuation. Under the above circumstances he may be replied that his request cannot be acceded.c Qualifying and Efficiency Bar Examination. Paper 3. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF ACCOUNTS.

British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, the \§th July 1932. From The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel Sir HUGH BISCOE, k.b.e., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. ( Proposed abolition of post of Interpreter, Bushire Residency. A' Sir, I have the honour to state that I have recently been examining the establishment of the Bushire Residency Office with a view to the possibility of effecting those economies which are so urgently required by the present financial position. The establishment of this office, however, is on a modest scale compared with offices of a similar status in India, and this, I think, will be admitted when I describe it in detail. 2. The General Office consists of a Registrar, three clerks and two copyists. This cannot be considered in any way excessive having regard to the large amount of work dealt with, and I have satisfied myself that no reduction is feasible, and that the clerical establishment is iully employed. 3. The Treasury Office consists of a Treasury Officer, one accountant, one clerk and a shroff. The accounts of eight sub-offices pass through Bushire, and there are always a number of miscellaneous accounts to be dealt with on behalf of the Navy, etc., while exchange matters add to their labours. No reduction is possible here. 4. The Confidential Office consists of a Confidential Assistant, a Confidential Clerk, a Stenographer and a Cypher Clerk. The work of this office is exceedingly heavy and moreover is steadily increasing ; whereas the General Office keep normal hours, the Confidential Office frequently have to work on holidays and often till a late hour at night. There is certainly no possibility of any reduction of the establishment in this Office. 5. There remains the Vernacular Office. This consists of an Indian Interpreter and two munshis, both of whom are Persians. The labours of the Vernacular Office have been enormously increased by the Persian import restrictions : special applications have to be made for every single article that I or my staff or the clerical establishment desire to import into Persia,, and 14 copies have to be made out of each application, i.e. 7 in Persia^TTOTtt^'^: 6 in English for the Persian authorities, and 1 for the Legation and 1 office copy ! Subsequently constant enquiries have to be made to the Customs Department to ascertain what permits have been received, etc., and it is no exaggeration to say that half the time of my Vernacular Office is nowadays taken up in trying to cope with the ever-changing regulations introduced by the Persian Government. Though no reduction in the strength of the esta blishment is possible, I consider that under present circumstances the cost of the vernacular establishment could be reduced without serious loss of efficiency.4 6. Formerly it was desirable to have a senior Indian official on my staff for dealing with local Persian officials, etc. Things have now changed however, and Persian officials with the exception of the Governor are no allowed nowadays to have any dealings with the officials of Foreign Consu lates, and the importance of the duties devolving upon the Interpreter have been reduced. The retention of an official on so high a rate of pay, at a time of financial stress, is hardly necessary. The Head Munshi has acted as inter preter in the past when the Indian Interpreter has been on leave and has fulfilled his duties adequately, and is competent to discuss minor matters with the local Governor. I would therefore recommend that the appointment should be abolished. 7. On the other hand, ever since I have been here I have experienced great difficulty owing to the fact that I have no Arabic munshi on my staff, and though the Indian Interpreter knows Arabic to a certain extent, he obviously cannot be expected to write letters in Arabic as would an Arab, or to interpret as would a native of the country. When I visited Ibn Saud in January 1930 I had the greatest difficulty in drawing up the notes which had to be exchanged, as I had no Arabic Interpreter with me, and actually the notes were drawn up by Ibn Saud's officials with such amendments and criticisms as suggested themselves to Colonel Dickson and myself, not a very satisfactory arrangement. When visiting the Trucial Coast I have twice had to borrow an Arabic munshi from Bahrain, thereby interfering with the normal working of the Bahrain office. I think it will be agreed that this state of affairs is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and that the Resident, whose work is now very largely centred on the Arab Coast, should have a competent munshi whose mother tongue is Arabic. I would therefore request sanction to the creation of a post of Arabic munshi to replace the Indian Interpreter. 8. The pay of the Interpreter is Rs. 350-20-450 plus Gulf Allowance Rs. 75, Customs Allowance Rs. 50, and House Rent Allowance Rs. 50, and as the present incumbent. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ali Soofi, is now drawing Rs. 430 his total emoluments come to Rs. 605, the average cost of the post being Rs. 604. The pay that I would recommend for the Arabic munshi is the same as that drawn by the Head Munshi (who would in future be known as Persian munshi), viz. Rs. 250—10—300, plus Gulf Allowance Rs. 50, House Rent Allowance Rs. 40 and Customs Allowance Rs. 25. The average cost of the post would thus be Rs. 407-4-0. There will thus be a saving to Government of Rs. 196-12-0 per mensem. 9. I would recommend that the present incumbent of the post of Interpreter, Khan Bahadur Muhammad Ali Soofi, should be granted the terms stated in Foreign and Political Department confidential memorandum No. D.5082-E/31 of the 21st November 1931. The Khan Bahadur has rendered many years of valuable service and before coming to Bushire was serving in Iraq both during and after the War. He therefore merits every consideration and concession that can be accorded to him, and had it not besn for the urgent need for effecting economies I should not have advocated the abolition of his post.

To The Foreign Secretary to the Government op India, Simla. Proposed abolition of post of Interpreter, Bushire Residency . Sir, I have the honour to state that I have recently been examining the establishment of the Bushire Residency Office with a view to the possibility of effecting those economies which are so urgently required by the present financial position. The establishment of this office, however, is on a modest scale compared with offices of a similar status in India, and this, I think, will be admitted when I describe it in detail. 2.

I am sure the evil acts of the Kadkhudas of Buir Ahmadi Garmsiri regarding the capture of Nasrullah Khan have been reported to you. In order to make it clear, I write this brief letter to you. Nasrullah Khan has been overtaken by a surprisingly overwhelming bad luck in these days. A few days ago he had gone with some of the men of Deel, who are his adherents, to the house of Mulla Darwish where he remained one day. Nasrullah Khan then took Mulla Darwish and went to the house of Qaid Ali Dad, though during the last two years there was such intense hostility between them that each party trembled on hearing the name of the other. When he arrived at Qaid Ali Dad's house, he and his companions were arrested and a man was sent to inform Muzaffar Khan at Aru. Muzaffar Khan rode at once to the house of Qaid Ali Dad and removed Nasrullah Khan and his men to Qalah-i-Aru for the security of their lives. As soon as I came to know of this, I rode out at once, in view of my duty to humanity and to my fellow human beings, to the house of Qaid Ali Dad. I arrived there just when Muzaffar Khan and Nasrullah Khan and other prisoners had left for Aru. As I had gone post-haste with two servants, I was compelled to return to Behbehan. Yesterday I received a letter from Nasrullah Khan and Muzaffar Khan requesting me to go to them quickly, and make an arrangement that may ensure the peace of both parties. I accepted their invitation and will Inshallah leave for Aru two hours hence. I will report to you in detail the position of affairs next week. No. 264 of 1919. B ritish R esidency and C onsulate -G eneral,. B ushire, 25th June. 1919. To K han S ahib HAJI MOIN-UT-TUJJAR, B ehbehan. A.C. I was absent from Bushire when the good news of your receiving the title of Khan Sahib from the High Government was received, and could not telegraph my congratulations, as the line is not yet repaired. I hope it soon will be. Agha Khalil will now give you my hearty congratulation I hope you will live long to obtain still higher distinctions. It is very difficult to deal with Behbehan affairs at this distance, and I am sorry I cannot come there myself for the present, until the last two rebels. ShaikhHusain and Zair Khedher, are disposed of. So I have sent Agha Khalil from the Residency, to consult you as to the best way of extricating Nasrullah Khan Boir Ahmadi from his present difficult position, and to represent me in the matter. I have given him a letter for the Deputy Governors but I should of course prefer it if the matter could be arranged without their interference. I only heard that they had arrived from Haji Lutf Ali Khan, who has just passed through Bushire, and as I know it is the habit of Bakhtiari Deputy Governors only to stay a very short time, it is possible that they have now gone away. It appears to me certain that Mirza Sultan Muhammad Khan has not behaved in a straight-forward way in this matter, and if he does not help Agha Khalil I shall no longer be able to regard him with friendship. You will of course help Agha Khalil in every way. (Sd.) J. H. BILL, i.c.s., D. P. R. No. 265 of 1919. B ritish R esidency and C onsulate- G eneral, B ushire, the 25th June, 1919. To MTRZA SULTAN MUHAMMAD, Q awam-i- D iwan, B ehbehan. A.C. You had told me in your last letter that you had gone out to try and arrange the affairs of the Boir Ahmadi in a satisfactory way, and that you would let me know the result on your return. I have been awaiting your letter, but T now hear that you have returned some time ago to Behbehan leaving Nasrullah Khan in captivity, and have written me nothing on the subject. My friend, this is not in accordance with the letter of friendship which I sent you the other day. If anyone desires the friendship of the High Government, he must act so as to show himself worthy of it. I am quite sure that if you used all your influence with Muzaffar Khan in the right direction he would comply. Unfortunately I cannot come to Behbehan myself at present, though I hope to do so in the autumn, so I have sent Agha Khalil to represent me, and to secure the release of Nasrullah Khan. You must make Muzaffar Khan understand that although Bushire is a long way off it is by no means advisable for him to displease the British Govern ment in this way. If he pretends that he is acting loyally to his own Government in arresting his own brother, he must prove it by surrendering him to the Persian authorities, and not keeping him a prisoner himself. He can have no right to do that. I wish you to understand that I expect this service from you, not because I wish to force anyone on the Boir Ahmadi as Kalantar, but because Nasrullah Khan's misfortunes began while he was my guest. You should try and make a regular peace between the two brothers, and in the tribe. If this is not possible, you must at least induce Muzaffar Khan to release his brother and let him come away to Bushire or Dilum, or wherever he wishes. (Sd.) J. H. BILL, i.c.s., D. P. R.

I very much regret to hear that you have now caught your brother by treachery and imprisoned him. I am tired of writing letters to a person4 who pays no attention to them* You seem to be determined to persist in a course of action which can only lead you into more serious trouble, i ave often told you before that I have nothing to do with the appointment ot a Kalantar for the Boir Ahmadi tribe, but that Nasrullah Khan is entitled to my friendship because you took his fort from him while he was my guest. For the same reason I now ask you to release him, and I am sure you will regret it bitterly in the future if you do not, or if any harm comes to him. I have sent Agha Khalil as my representative in this matter, and expect you to deal with him in the matter in a way which shall be in accordance with the professions you have so often made, that you desire the friendship of the British Government.

Yesterday morning, that is 26th Ramazan, an aeroplane flew over Bandar Rig and dropped a letter which fell in the middle houses of the village, and returned. They brought the letter to me and I saw it was from you. I read it and I felt greatly honoured, pleased and obliged. Agha Khalil has not arrived here up to now. I believe he has thought to come at the termination of Ramazan. Nasrullah Khan's wife came to Bandar Dilum a few days ago with a view to taking Husain Khan to Aru and Deel to persuade Hayatullah Khan to evacuate the fort and village of Deel and hand them to Muzaffar Khan so that the latter may then release Nasrullah Khan. As the woman is in a desperate condition, she has come to Dilum and proposed this to Husain Khan. But it is evident that Muzaffar Khan will not release Nasrullah Khan even if Deel is evacuated. I believe he will be killed or made blind. The reason why they have not killed or blinded him as yet, is because they intend to get Deel. But as the journey is dangerous for Husain Khan, he does not want to go there, nor does Hayatullah Khan leave Deel. Husain Khan's visit will be fruitless and perilous. I sent you with my previous letter a copy of the telegram which Haji Said-ud-Saltaneh sent in reply to Agha Khan Lirawi's telegram. Agha Khan's representations and complaints are not without a cause, and he has reason to Complain because the original rent was too much for Lirawi. Moreover, the lack of good crops for 7 years and the locust devasta tion this year has placed the Khan and subjects of that district in a pitiful condition. But Agha Khan will not act contrary to your advice and to what you think advisable. If you think advisable for him to pay now the same rent as he has paid for some years past, he will do so and obey your order, though he may have to sell his animals and household effects. He will have ultimately to sell his household effects.You had written at the end of the letter dropped by the aeroplane that Germany has accepted the peace terms and was to sign them next day. I was very glad to hear this and I thank God that the High British Government has become victorious against the enemy Governments especially the German Government in spite of all her pride and haughtiness, and that peace is made in accordance with their wish. P.S. —You will have heard that two Bakhtiari Deputy Governors have come to Behbehan, namely, Agha Slan and Agha Khoda-Murad. Telegram. From AGHA KHALIL, Behbehan. To J. H.

The following is an office note :— ' H.M.'s Consul, Ahwaz, proposes further increases in the rates of pay of the Ahwaz Escort establishment of 6 Indian sowars on the ground that the Foreign Office have given similar increases to their menial staff. The Ahwaz Escort establishment were granted increased rates of pay in January 1937. Although we estimated for Rs. 1,600 for the pay of the Ahwaz Escort, the Government of India have included only Rs. 1,000 in the current year's budget. The proposed increases, even if the post of 2nd Farrash continues to be kept vacant, would therefore result in an excess over the budget provision. This excess would be increased if the Rupee-Rial exchange rate continues to depreciate. In the circumstances, I think that the proposed increases require the sanction of the Government of India, and that a case should be made out and submitted for increasing the pay of the Escort establish ment at Ahwaz.' The following is the Secretary's reply to the above note put up by office :— ' In view of the present financial stringency, the Government of India are not likely to consider any proposals for increases in pay, unless ways and means of meeting the proposed increases are suggested. The possibility of the Government of India accepting the proposed savings without agreeing to the proposed increases must also be considered. It will be seen that Ahwaz spends approximately Rs. 1,700 on Escort Contingencies. Of this sum, Rs. 900 per annum represents the rent of the stables and the rest the cost of food and equipment for the horses.'2 Marks.

To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, SIMLA. Memorandum No. 1725. Bushire, the 2Qth September, 1922. Ahwaz Consulate Building. With reference to your memorandum No. 2174/406-Est., dated 24th July, 1922, I beg to report as follows on the points raised by the Govern ment of India :— {a) I attach herewith a statement which gives the accommodation proposed. (6) Although the Consulate is only designed for a married Consul, I think that in ordinary circumstances, if the Consul had not a large family, the building could accommodate a bachelor Vice-Consul as well. The accommodation is, of course, amply sufficient for both Consul and Vice-Consul if they are unmarried. It, however, would not be sufficient if both officers were married, though this is not a very likely con tingency nor would it be very suitable for a married Vice- Consul whether the Consul had his wife with him or not. This, however, would usually be remedied by changing the Vice-Consuls at Ahwaz and Dizful as it is not probable that both these junior officers would be married. (c) The building is constructed on a pucca style according to the following specifications :— Foundation. —Broken brick and lime concrete. Plinth. —Stone and lime masonry. Superstructure, outer walls, —Stone and lime masonry. Superstructure, inner icalls. —Stone and lime masonry. Flooring, ground floor. —Broken stone gatch plastered. Flooring, first floor. —Burnt brick and jack arching. Roofing. —U.S. beams, joists, flat tiles, bhan mud, mud plaster finished with lime plaster. Doors. —Pucca teak panelled, and glazed. Windows. —Pucca teak glazed.4 The upkeep charges per annum would be :— Ordinary repairs at 2 per cent, on Rs. 2,23,900 — Rs. 4,478- Special repairs at 1 per cent, on .. Rs. 2,23,900 = Rs. 2,239 Rs. 6,717 {d) and (e) This figure should, I consider, include upkeep, i.e.,. any large repairs required on account of dilapidation. The local custom appears to be that the owner bears the cost of all outside repairs while the tenant has to bear the cost of inside repairs, and if this is calculated at J owner and f tenant according to the Public Works Department calculations the cost to the owner would be 1 per cent, and thus he would get an interest on his capital of either 8 or 9 per cent, which I do not think can be considered excessive for Persia. Paragraph 2 of your letter. I send herewith 5 rough plans of the proposed Consulate and a rough estimate. The local style at Ahwaz is reported to be as follows :— Foundations, stone and mud. Plinth, stone and mud, protected with mud plaster. Superstructure, outside ivcdls, stone and mud, gatch plastered outside and mud plastered inside. Superstructure, interior icalls. Katcha brick mud plastered. Floorings, broken stone, gatch plastered. Roofings, chandels, arab mats, date sticks and mud. Doors, windows and all wood-ivork. Imported from India. The only variation in the rough estimate sent by this office is for foundation and plinth and superstructure outer walls, the former must be of stone and lime or brick and lime, it is immaterial whether the latter is stone and mud or brick and mud. The span of the main rooms is too great for chandels, brick and jack arching has been substituted. I consider it would be much better to have the Consulate, if it is to be built, constructed on a pucca style and it will be worth the difference which will not be very much. There is no doubt that it is essential that a suitable Consulate should be erected at Ahwaz and I earnestly trust the Government of India will be pleased to approve of these proposals and accord their sanction at an early date. (Sd.) Lietjt.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf..From The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum No. 719/406, Est- D elhi, dated the 5th March, 1923. Ahwaz Consulate Building. Your Memorandum No. 1725, dated the 20^ September, 1922. The Government of India are advised that the proposed building is. unnecessarily large for a married Consul alone and is unsuitable for two married families, though it would be possible to accommodate a bachelor Vice-Consul lodger who either messed with the Consul or was served from the one kitchen. Any of these arrangements might in practice prove inconve nient and it is suggested that it might be more suitable to provide separate residences for the Consul and Vice-Consul on the lines of the plans enclosed (Marked A and B). The cost of these two houses, which could be situated in the same compound and be served from the same power house is roughly estimated at 2-|- lakhs, including outhouses. 2. The Government of India would prefer that the repairs, both outside and inside, should be undertaken by Government and not by the Shaikh and that a correspondingly reduced sum be paid to the Shaikh, which would represent interest on his capital. It is observed that you suggest 8 or 9 per cent., but this is perhaps unduly high. 3. Please state whether you consider the plans sent as suitable in the light of your local knowledge, and, if so, or if they require only small modifications, submit a rough estimate and proposals for an agreement on the subject with the Shaikh of Mohammerah. 4. The plans received with your memorandum under reference are returned herewith. (Sd.) DENYS BRAY, Secretary to the Government of India ~ Attested, (Sd.) Illegible. Superintendent, F. &amp; P.

I have the honour to return herewith in original memorandum No. 719/406-Est., dated the 5th March, 1923 from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department to your address together with revised plans A and B, the site plan and the original rough plans for a new Consulate building at Ahwaz. 2. I have discussed the revised plans fully with Mr. Jamieson, the Fields Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company who has a very wide experience of house building in Arabistan. Mr. Jamieson considers the revised plans eminently suitable provided the houses are oriented in such a, way as to secure the maximum protection from the sun : that is to say they should be built facing nearly due north and not parellel to the bank of the river. He was of opinion that the houses could be built within the limit contemplated by the estimate but added that if necessary, economies could be effected by [a) lowering the height of the central wall in plan B from 22' to 18'-6' and {b) by combining the 'Pakka' and 'Kachha' specifications as follows :— Foundation.- —Broken brick and lime concrete. Plinth. —Stone and lime masonry. Superstructure.—Ow tside walls. Stone and mud pointed with gatch outside and mud plastered inside. Swper structure .— I n t erior walls above floor level. Kachha brick and plastered. Flooring. —Rammed broken stone with gatch plastered surface. Roofing. —R.S. beams, joists, corrugated iron, bhan mud, and plaster finished with lime plaster. Doors. —Pukka teak panelled and glazed but single instead of double doors. Windoios. —Pukka teak glazed. 3. In view of the conflicting proposals which have been made to the Shaikh of Mohammerah from time to time and the immense delay which has occurred since the subject of a new Consulate at Ahwaz was first mooted I was compelled to approach the Shaikh with considerable caution with a viewto obtaining a settlement on the lines indicated in your telegram No. 766, dated 25th April 1922. After several interviews I have now been able to obtain the Shaikh's agreement to the following proposals :— {i) Two houses to be built on the approved site at a cost not exceeding 2J lakhs of rupees, this sum to be provided by the Shaikh as required. (ii) If two houses are built, simple interest on the capital outlay to be calculated at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum and reckoned from the date on which the money is actually paid. N.B. —The Shaikh is prepared to put down the capital sum at once if necessary, but if it is required to be paid gradually interest must be cal culated on each instalment as it is paid. {Hi) If only one house is built interest to be calculated at 9 per cent, per annum. (iv) All expenditure on repairs whether internal or external to be paid for by the tenant. {v) Possession on the above terms to be guaranteed for thirty years renewable on fresh terms at the end of that period. {vi) All buildings erected within the containing walls, now or subse quently, to be paid for with the Shaikh's capital. (vii) Sufficient space to be left at the north end of the site between the boundary wall and the Moin's garden to permit of a thoroughfare to the river bank and to allow the Shaikh to build a house for himself if he wishes to. 4. Before commenting on the above proposals it may be of interest to recall the conditions suggested in despatch No. 457 dated 28th February 1907 from Major P. Z. Cox, Resident at Bushire, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. The capital outlav was to be borne by the Government of India and after making due allowance for the withholding of rent in order to recoup the original outlay the following alternatives were offered :— (a) Rent to be assessed at 8 per cent, on the capital outlay with the option of renewal on fresh terms after 25 years, or (b) rent to be assessed at 6 per cent, on the capital outlay with the option of renewal on fresh terms after 20 years. Simultaneously a loan of two lakhs of rupees bearing interest at 5 per cent, to be given to the Shaikh by the Government of India. 5. I note that the Government of India in their memorandum No. 719/406-Est. dated 5th March 1923 have suggested that the rate of 8 or 9 per cent. ' is perhaps unduly high.' I venture to submit that in all the circumstances 8 per cent, may be considered a reasonable return for the10 Shaikh's capital outlay. It must be remembered that in Persia and Meso potamia very high rates of interest are charged even by British concerns. For example, the Manager of the local Branch of the Imperial Bank 01 Persia informs me that his bank's normal discount rate is 12 per cent, and that onlv large sums on exceptional security would be lent at even 9 per cent, interest. The Government of India could no doubt borrow money more cheaply in the open market but in the present case they appear to be prevented from doing so. The point is that the Shaikh is not prepared to lend his money unless he can obtain what he considers to be a reasonable return upon it judged by the opportunities which he enjoys of lending his money at higher rates of interest locally. He is certainly strongly under the impression that by lending money at 8 per cent, to the Government of India he is com mitting a very friendly act. In view of the fact that the capital sum required is a large one and that the Shaikh can make no use of it in the meantime it seems only reasonable to calculate interest from the date of payment rather than from the date of completion of the buildings. I would add that the value of building land at Ahwaz has greatly appreciated during the last few 3 ^ears, that the site has been kept vacant for Government when it might have been sold outright for cash and that no ground rent is being charged. I am convinced that these proposals represent the irreducible minimum which the Shaikh will accept and that if the Government of India feel com pelled to modify them it is useless to pursue the negotiations further. 6. The only favourable period for building purposes in Arabistan is from April to November inclusive and if the Government of India are pleased to accept the proposals I have put forward it is urgently necessary that building should be commenced with the least possible delay. For this reason I suggest that attention be concentrated on the smaller of the two houses (plan B) and that every effort be made to complete this during the current year. Plan A could be left until the summer of 1924. It is obvious that the work must be undertaken by an Officer of the Public Works Department and I trust it will be possible to depute an officer for this purpose. In the mean time if telegraphic orders are issued I can arrange for the collection of stone, lime, etc., on the spot. 7. As regards Electric power and a water supply for the new building I think it will be possible to come to an amicable arrangement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company who hope to have a new electrical plant installed by next autumn. On receipt of definite instructions from you I propose to address the Company independently and ascertain the terms on which they would be prepared to supply our needs.
