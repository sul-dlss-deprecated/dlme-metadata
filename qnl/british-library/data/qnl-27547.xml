Political A^ent and H.E.M’s Consul, Muscat, To The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, Sir Please refer to the correspondence ending with my letter No,493 dated the 20th March 1919 on the subject of the prolongation of the Commercial Treaty, This treaty terminates on the 10th February next, I would propose a further extension for a period of one year with wording similar to the existing prolongation. There is no doubt in my mind that the treaty needs revision especially with regard to the tarif, which is at present five per cent. This will entail however the revision in addition of the treaty of 1833 between the United States of America and Muscat, and of the treaty of 1844 between the French Government and Iluxcat• Article 3 of the American treaty and Article 10 of the French treaty both lay down five per cent as the maximum duty which may be levied. The tarif question must also be very carefuly considered in relation to the various tarifs levied by other states bordering on the Persian Gulf, The Bahrein duty is also five per cent according to the treaty of 1861, The rate of duty in Kowelt I do not know. On the other hand the duties levied in Mesopotamia and Persia are quite different, This bearing point has also a considerable on subject of the prevention of emuggiing. It would I venture to suggest be of ^reat advantage to all concerned if the customs arrangements of theArabian States of the Grillf c &gt;ul&amp; be reviewed this year with the object of arriving at a definite policy and if possible a definite agreement which will unify the arrangements through -out . It will be seen that it would be impossible at present satisfactorily to revise the treaty owing to the many considerations involved. Prolongation for a period of one year will admit of the question being carefully examined, and the wording of the prolongation admits of the treaty being replaced by another before the expiry of this period.

I do not hnow whether His Highness wknts an increase in the Customs Tariff or whether you thinb it would be better to raise it for the benefit of the State; at one time there was an idea (held by Sir H.

Yours sincerely, Sd/~ A. II. L. Cater. The Hon J ble Lieutenant Colonel A. P. Trevor,C . S.J . ,C.1.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Enshire•Your D/0 of the Xith instant regarding the rerision of the Commercial Treaty* The question of the revision of the treaty now raises a large number of points, an! with your permission I want to put them before you. You will probably think that I am an awful trouble an! am raising a number of unnecessary hares , but if you think the situation worth consilering from the point of view ©xpresse! in this letter it will probably have some effect upon the exact details of what you want done. First of all as regards a few points in the treaty if it is revised. I am sure you are right now as to the inadvisability of raising the tariff. In the first place as long as Muscat has treaties with other countries we cannot raise it as regard! ourselves wltaout posing the position of most favour©! nation. It seems scarcely worth wh.i].e entering into all the diplomatic trouble which would be involved, and the questions that might be asked, for Ui© sake of possibly increasing the income of this insignificant state. In tn© second place such action would lose half its point if itx was not accompanied by the raising of one tariff In ta« other states of the Gulf. In the third place I doubt if it is worth while risking the possible outcry from Oman which has peculiar ideas on the subject of all customs. I tiiink also it might be necessary slightly to alter some of the clauses in tne draft treaty of 1904 in the light of our experience. I refer especially to the clauses dealing with the estimation of the duty, and I would suggest the insertion of a clause tnat while affirming the fact that export duty is not permitted at the same time mentioned the rigat of the Sultan to levy his zakat on gaais produce grownin his iorainlons and brougnt to the coast towns. Tills might in the future save a lot of trouble. However to get back to the real point of this letter. We have arrived in Muscat as you know at a rather interesting situation. To put it very shortly a bankrupt rule { embodying really no administration at&amp;ll, and practically not functioning except to give some decision in a case involving a British subject, and that only under pressure, was supported at great expense by us from certain annihilation by the Omanis. At the same time we made no attempt to improve the actual administration, on the grounds that it was not our business. Tills was however indefensible as else why did we give it armed sux^port, pay it and save it ? This has now been replaced by a rule that is Arab at least in personnel and conforms in a small degree to the requirements of reasonable administration, while it just pulls along financially and provides its own defence, instead of our providing it. But the real head of the administration declines to interest himself in any way and is an absentee as long as possible, and the driving force is the influence of the Political Agent, whose advice must be asked and followed on all questions of importance. It is almost unnecessary to add that this advice under the conditions of the last eighteen months has had to be given frequently. While all these events were going on the absence of the Sultan was if anything beneficial, it was possible to get a move on, and he and his father have always been regarded as the source of all evil by a large section of their subjects. Now a form of constitutional rule, if it can be so termed has been introduced, ought not the Sultan to take more interest ? In other wor d s -for the moment we have extricated ourselves and the Sultan from what was admittedly a bad show,and wnich evary proape becoming worse&gt; but though theoretical we have reduced our ic&amp;jfcoLl Interference to aliaoet nil, we hare increased Inerltablj our Interference in admlnlatratlon&gt; and so our responsibility especially owin , to the attitude of the Sultan* Ought we not now to call a halt, and make him accept this responsibility for the future.? The moment Is a propitious one. We do not I imagine, haTin^ got rid of one lot want of embaraaslng responsibilities, to enter unwittingly upon another set which may crentually be worse* The two sides of the question are that the Sultan wants us to rule his state for him because there is much more chance of his being able to lead a comfortable life in that case, we X presume want to do nothing of the sort, and in the future Y«rill be only concerned in the interests of our own subjects and in tendering the minimum amount of advice The position of the Sultan is (i) He has talcen a loan from us on condition that he reforms his adminstration, permits us to control his finance, establlsnes a levy and follows our advice, (3) these conditions he has fulfilled, («5) He refuses to take any interest in affairs and wishes to abdicate and to make us responsible. Our position is ( l) We have done these things go any further (8) We iont want to iax&amp;ityx&amp;isxft, Sven our loan is fuHr secured on the subsidies, (3) We want the Sultan to accept responsibility, wnich is morally and actually his. To the Sultan it seems therefore, must be brought home a realisation of his position, which bluntly is a-s follows ;(n) The ©ub#iai®8 are personal to him. Were he to abdicate they would automatically cease, and he would be a peniless man as he haa no private property atall, and even if his successor were to promise him an allowance we would in no way be responsible for it, (b) Should in the future the state fall into disorder in its finances or otherw3.se, the subsidies are pledged to u® for the redemption of our loan, and they will automatically be stopped. It is to be presumed that hi® ministers will be able to pay him nothing under such circumstances. (c) Though his state is now aelf-supporiing and has a defence force, it still only exist® througn our moral support. Should that be withdrawn it will crumble to dust at once. And we will withdraw it should tne Sultan persist in his attitude, or should he not act in accordance with our wishes in important matter® and not continue the reform of his administration. (d) We have more than fulfilled, and at great cost our duty toward® him. It is up to him now. He must be the reaponsi- -ble ruler of his state. If anything goes wrong now we accept no responsibility. It is his alone. (e) We have made oeace for him with the tribes. The maintenanc of this peace depends on the tribes knowing that we support him and the agreement which was mad© through us. All I would ask if that the Sultan should be made to understand these important points thoroughly. He is no fool, but he seems to think that the British Empire is only ! ,oo delighted to take on fresh responsibilities and to administer places, quit© regardless if it pays us or not, or If it is for our own benefit. I would not ask trie Sultan even to reside a fixed period of the year in Muscat. I would leave it to him, but I would Insist that he is personally responsible for all important measures such as the appointment 1of ministers and uign omcials, for knowing tue financial condition, for fixing salax-ies, for lookiiag after iii* family. for being acquaint#! witx^ political events, etg, and X would a. r m, vr U* * u-i-MM-tZ se# t’oat evox*ybody knew this* At present he never even answer# / . r-,. tii© querie# of his ministers on any subject. Once «e nave cleared up the position and attitude of the Sultan, we are then in a position to revise treaties or do anything els© we like. But it seems at present that there is the danger of an artificial situation developing, gRdxkgxxkxaxkksxxhfiifcxg The moment is a critical one. One phase is over and another beginning. The second phase may develop into what tne world regards as British protectorate unless we make the situation clear, tnough nox actually at the moment it is much less like it than it was before. And this development will take place so to speak against our own will and simply as the result of circumstances unless we seize the present opportunity, which is unique, for settling the matter onceS of 1921 Ho* l±h\ S of 1921.

It will be remembered that the position of the self- governing Dominions in relation of this Treaty has been the * subject of several discussions dobing recent years. 3. As long f as 1908, a despatch w»s received from the governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, asking that notice might be given o'' the termination of th$s Treaty (amongst others) in respect of Australia, in view of the fact that the Treaty of 1891, whilst providing for the adherence of the Dominions, made no similar provision for withdrawal, a reply was sent to the Governor General, with the concurrence * of the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, indicating that the matter was one of some difficulty, and that a special Convention would require to be made. The oorrrspondence refe rred to will be found in the letters from this Department of the 3rd June, and the 1st July 1908 and the letter from the Foreign Office of the 19th June, 1908. 4. In a letter from the Foreifeb Office of the 13th September, 1909, it was stated that the desirability of entering into an agreement to allow withdrawal of the Overseas Dominions in/ respect of this Treaty was being considered, such an agreement having already been made in the similar case 8 of the Treaty with Paraguay. T he substance of this letter was communicated to the Governor General of Australia in Lord 0rewe , s despatch of the 8th October 1909. , P ; !5* negotiations were subsequently entered into with regard to the Austro-Hun an, Italian and Mexican Treaties (see Foreign Office letter of the 11th December, 1909, and the letter from this Department of the 24th November, 1909), and Governor General was informed on 3rd December, 1909 that Sir E.Grey proposed to await replies with regard to these Treatie • * before making any communication to Muscat* 6* The matter then remained in abeyance until 1911, when i\r was taken up again in connection with the general arrangem resulting from the Imperial Conference of 1911, for enabling the self-governing Dominions to withdraw from Commercial treaties* It was, however, settled to leave out Muscat from ♦ the arrangements then initiated on the ground that It was doubtful whether the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1891 affected the lilferty of the Dominions as regards custom's duties, and the Treaty might be terminated at an early date* 7* The question of the Treaty as far as it affected Canada was raised in connection with the Canadian Order in Council o the 16th December, 1913, respecting coasting trade* It is mentioned in the Memorandum on the inclusion of Coasting Trade In Commercial Treaties, enclosed In Foreign Office lett of the 23rd July, 1914| and in the despatch to the Governor General of Candda of the'7th October, 1914, in the terms of which Sir E* Grey concurred (see Foreign Office Letter of the 30th September), it was stated that His Majesty’s Government were of the opinion that Muscat was entitled to participate in the Canadian coastal trade on the most-favoured-nation footing* 8* In view of the above facts it is clear that the continued existence of the 1891 Treaty is not a matter of indifference to the Dominions, and in the circumstances, Mr* Churchill does not consider that the Treaty should be further renewed without the insertion of a clause giving to the Dominions separate liberty of withdrawal* 9* Ipf am to request that, if Lord Curzon agrees to this course, he will cause such a clause to be prepared inin draft and communicated to this Office* 10* A copy of this letter is being sent to the Board of Trade•■nRasraeMBMjjusAJimamna G crv»—J biaJL Ho, 1475 of 1921, Political Agency &amp; K,B,M f s Consulate, Muscat, the 21st December 1921, To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.

Best course in the circumstances is I think for Political Agent to renew o^d treaty on return of Sultan of Maskat and as soon as points raised in second para' graph of his telegram are settled proceed with new treaty. r This refers to Maskat telegramj No, 208, Telegram P., No. 364, dated (and received) the 27th February 1922. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, (Repeated Political Agent, Maskat). There was some talk when Tdewellyn Smith’s Commi^ion came up of trying to get tariffs on more,or less uniform basis round Gulf. The object of this was to reduce inducements to smuggling. I do not think we need go out of our way to help in this matter as our action would chiefly benefit Persia. Persia is now thoroughly anii-British 'and Anglo-Persian treaty has never been ratified. I see therefore no reason for revising tariff unless any special local reasons exist for such a course. This refers to your ielegramf No, 23.8-S., and Muscat telegramJ No. 7-C. Demi-official telegram P., No. 414, dated and (received) the 3rd March 1922. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulp Bushire. (Repeated Muscat). I should think that in the same way as in previous years treaty could h e pro 1 eng__ as before February 11th. Sultan was apparently agreeable to prolonging i . ere i was not on the spot to sign. This refers to Maskat’s telegram No. 10-C., *and your telegram No. 271 C.From Telegram P., No. 425, dated the 4th (received the 5th) March 1922. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Serial No. 29 T have received a wire from the Political Agent Maskat to the effect that al ii the enhancement of the tariff will in his opinion be necessary eventually for tll0Ug g 0 f revenue, the consent of the Prench and American Governments will be P ur ^ d before any such action can be taken. This even in favourable circums- talces would take some time to procure. He therefore thinks that tariff revision nn rould take some time to procure. might be taken up later, and that if possible the treatv should be revised (renewed ? ) now, leaving tariff where it is. I agree that it would probably delav matters — considerably to alter tariff (sic.)* I think that the Political Agent has su o- o'ested the best course to pursue, if alteration of the tariff could subsequently be carried out by simply amending one of the clauses of the treaty.

The orders of the Government of India were that, pending the con clusion 0 ;:’ the Anglo-French Arbitration proceed- ings at tne Hague, no steps should be taken to ascertain jrhe views df H.H. the Sultan on this. « Draft. j- he matter remained in abeyance until iTo- vember 1910 when the late Sultan notified his desire - vide his letter Q.n page 35 of the seine file - for the revision of the existing Treaty an and gave 12 months’ notice as required by the terms of the Treaty. He also said that he wish ed to make in the new Treaty the additions and alterations mentioned by him in the note which he gave to the Political Agent in 1905. A trans lation of this note is one page 41. The P.R. instructed the P.A. - vide his Ho.530 dated 5-3-11 on page 47 - to discuss these proposals with H.H. and in due course to submit a residue in a suitable form for consideration by Govt. On the 15th May 1911 the Sultan sent a Draft Treaty (page 113) as he considered it should stand, and about the 23rd idem the P.A. placed in his hands a translation of the Draft of revised Treaty received from the Govt.of India. On the 27th idem he called on H.H. th discuss both the drafts simultaneously, but as H.H. would not discuss the proposals made by himself he dropped the subject and reported the fact to the P.R* in his D©Q.letter ITo.k5 dateddated 25-6-11 (page 151) and letter No!31 ILted^ }p\ s.pa^e r 53 ). Subsequent aorrespondence vrtiieh took place between the P.A. and the p.R. IS between pages 155 and 177. The P.R. (sir Cox; eventually decided to come to Muscat to go through the Articles with His Highness and tue Political Agent, but it appears he was not able to come to Muscat until a day after ( 5 th October 1913) the death of the Sultan when he paid a visit of condelence to the new Sultan and the A1 Bu Sayyid family and returned to Bushire. Saiyid Taimur a few days later was formally 1 ' recognised as the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and the Muscat subsidies which were withheld re granted to him on the condition that the Revision of Commercial Treaty would be postponed - vide telegram Ho.102 dated 23-1-14 on page 46 of file 33/7. In 1914 the Treaty was prolonged for 5 years and from 1919 it is being prolonged every year. In his letter ITo.9-S dated 4-1-20 (page 9 file 33/3) Mr. Wingate said that the Treaty needs revision with regard to the Tariff, but that this would entail the revision of the Treaty of 1833 between the U.S,A.- and Muscat and of 1844 between the French Govt, and Muscat. oir Llewylen Smith and the Tariff Commission favoured the raising of the Customs duties on the Arabian side of the Gulf to bring them into line with Persian Tariff if and when axHxxixxxx x evisea. But Colonel Trevor in his D.O.lettsr dated 11—4—21 (page 43 file 33 / 3 ) said thau an ad valorem tcirifi was simplest and that as the /inglo Ie.i.sic~n ^Vgree — ment had been dropped we had better stick to the old 5 / with perhaps a proviso that this might be raised by mutual agreement without having to make a new Treaty and that perhaps Article VIIVS '/II would, have to he modified as regards Arms and ^/‘Unition. He practically repeated the above to .-oreign in his telegram Ho.364 of 27-2-22 (page oG; and stated that for reasons given there- ±n tLe tariff should not be raised unless local reasons existed. The P.A., Major Rae, replied - vide his telegram ITo.Q-C of 28-2-22 (pa^e 88 ) that tariff should be raised to increase revenue, but in a later telegram Ho.l 3 -C de.ted 3-3-22 (page 94) said that as tariff could not be raised without the consent of the Govts, of America and France the Treaty if possible should ; be revised without touching the tariff. In this opinion the Resident concurred - vide his telegram Ho.425 dated 4-3-22 (page 104) to Foreign.■DMRiM tnmmmmmm 1 1 s No. 269-S of 1926.

The original Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Faisal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi. The renewal of the Treaty was upon the request of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Taimur bin Faisal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi. The Treaty was renewed on the 11 of February of each year between 1919 and 1931. The renewed treaties of 1919-1926 were signed by the Political Agent in charge and the Sultan, whereas, the treaties renewed between 1927 and 1931 were signed by the Political Agent in charge and the Council of Ministers on behalf of the Sultan.Up until 1922, the wording of the Treaty was the same as that in 1891; however, in 1923 a new line was added to the wording of the Treaty which gives the right to the Dominions to withdraw from the Treaty whenever they want. This was done upon the Dominions’ request. The renewed Treaty of 1924 included a line about the right of Canada to withdraw, and that Australia had already withdrawn. All treaties from 1925 onwards included a line about the right of Canada and Ireland to withdraw and that Australia had already withdrawn.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000290#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
