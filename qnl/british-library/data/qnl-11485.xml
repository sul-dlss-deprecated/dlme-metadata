Bright and glowing visions are conjured up by its very name. We may picture to ourselves the line of Patriarch Kings worshipping their one God in days of old; the Monarchs who, as we learn from the Books of Isaiah and Ezra, obeyed the will of Jehovah, and were chosen instruments in his hands; who not only reared the famed palace of Persepolis for their own glory, but covered the land with aqueducts for the good of their people. How heart-stirring, too, is the narrative of Ferdausy, which tells of Eustam the hero of Iran, and of the struggle with the powers of evil, typified by Afrasiab and his Turanians! In later times we are dazzled by the magnificence of the Sassanians and of the Khalifahs, delighted by the beauties of Persian poetry, and filled with astonishment at the conquests of Jengiz and of Timur; while we dwell with pleasure on the revived glories of 'Abbas the Great, and deplore the present misgovernment of modern Persia.vi PREFACE. The following outline of Persian history, from the days of the first Paishdadian patriarch to the present year, will offer a connected sketch of the annals of that interesting country. The writer does not possess the advantage of a knowledge of the Persian language, and is dependent on translations for his materials. But he undertook the task because, in translating and annotat ing Clavijo's ' Embassy to Timur,' he had occasion to refer to nearly all the translated Persian authorities and to the European writers on Persia; ■ and he had amassed a large number of notes and memoranda chronologically arranged. He thought that the preparation of a con nected historical sketch, based on these materials, would be acceptable at a time when Persia is receiving much attention from politicians, and would serve a useful purpose in time to come ; seeing that Persia will always continue to be a most important neighbour State, with reference to British India. In narrating the chief events of Persian history, geo graphical descriptions of the provinces and cities have been introduced, and sketches of the lives of the poets, with specimens of their works, will be found, when the stream of time brings us down to the days in which they flourished. The translations of Persian poetry are chiefly taken from the works of Sir 'William Jones, Sir Gore Ouseley, Atkinson, Falconer, Kirkpatrick, East- wick, and Costello. The materials for the history of Iran are exceedinglyPREFACE. Vll voluminous. As regards the early history, which in volves numerous disputed points, it has been thought best to give a sketch of the native stories preserved by the poet Ferdausy; 1 upon which the Grecian writers and the cuneiform inscriptions form parallel commen taries. Other native sources for this earliest period are the translations of Mirkhond by Shea, and of Tabari in the series of the Oriental Translation Fund. 2 Much light has been thrown on the Kaianian and Sassanian Periods by Sir Henry Eawlinson and M. Flandin ; and Mr. Thomas, in his interesting numismatic treatises, has done a great deal to elucidate the history of the Sassanian Dynasty. 3 There are also many doubtful and disputed questions respecting the ancient Zend language, the early religions 1 The Shah-Namah of Ferdausy, in an abridged form, was trans lated by Mr. James Atkinson, of the East India Company's Bengal Medical Service, and published in 1832. The edition of Jules Mohn (4 vols., Paris 1838), is printed in parallel French and Persian columns. Mr. W. T. Robertson published the translation of the episode of Eustam and Zqhrah, from the Shah- Ndmah, at Calcutta, in 1829. 2 Tabari was the earliest Persian historian. He was born at Amol in 838, and died at Baghdad in 922 a.d . His work consists of six parts :—1. On the ancient kings of Persia. 2. The reign of Kai Kobad and the kings of Yemen. 3. On the Sassanian Dynasty. 4 and 5 on Muhammad, and 6, on the first four Khalifahs. In 1836 the translation of Tabari, which is the most ancient Persian work now extant, was published by the Oriental Translation Fund.

In the chapter on this subject, the views of Dr. Haug have been condensed, though I am aware that Mr. Thomas and other learned Orientalists are not in accord with Haug on several important questions. In so brief a sketch it is perhaps the best course to give the conclusions of the leading modern Zend scholar, without venturing upon a re ference to any of the disputed points. The chapter on the Khalifahs is derived from various well known sources; but the account of the reigns of the Ommeyahs is almost entirely from the work of Conde. 1 The events of the long period of 700 years, from the decay of the Arab power to the rise of the Sufawi Dynasty, are pleasantly told in Malcolm's ' History.' The best native historian of this interval is Mirkhond 2 (more correctly Mir Khawand), who derived his materials from nineteen Arabic and twenty-two Persian histories; but there is no entire English translation. It was translated by Pedro Texeira, and re-translated into English in 1715 by Stevens; and large portions are given by Major Price, Shea, and Morley.

C. D'Ohsson. 1 For the life of Timur and his successors the translated materials are ample. The great conqueror's own Institutes were translated by Major Davy, and edited by Prof. White at Oxford, in 1783. His were translated by Major Stewart, and published by the Oriental Translation Fund in 1830 ; 2 and the well known history by Sharafu -'d-Din Yazdi is accessible through the translation of Petis de la Croix. 3 But still more complete details respecting the Court of Timur are to be gathered from the charming narrative of Euy Gonzalez de Clavijo. 4 For the period between the fall of the Timiirides and the rise of the Sufawi Dynasty, in addition to oriental 1 Histoire des Mongols depuis TcKhan jusqu'a on Tamerlan, par M. le Baron G (4 vols., Amsterdam 1852).

Their authen ticity is proved by the fact that the Memoirs are quoted by Sharafu- 'd-Din, who wrote only thirty years after Timor's death.

It was then that Europeans began to appear upon the scene; and the travels of Chardin, Tavernier, Pietro del Valle, Garcia da Silva, Herbert, Kcempfer, Struys, Thevenot, Hamilton, Sanson, and Krusinski supply ample materials for history. Father Krusinski was an eye-witness of the events at Isfahan which led to the downfall of the Sufawis. It was during the flourishing period of the Sufawis that the Shirleys, those gallant knights who had been reared in that age of British worthies—the glorious reign of Elizabeth, visited the Court of Persia ; 2 while Anthony Jenkinson penetrated into the wilds of Central Asia, and was the first Englishman who hoisted the cross of St. George in the Caspian Sea.

His travels are written in the good old God fearing spirit of the days of Ealeigh and Gilbert, though he lived during the reign of the second George. The reader cannot fail to be attracted by the writings of this honest Englishman. His navigation of the Caspian, his journey through Mazandaran to the camp of Mdir, his perils at Astrabltd, and the prayer to God which he composed when he was in danger of being sold as a slave to the Turkmans, establishes a warm sympathy between the good old traveller and every one of his countrymen who reads his book. The Dynasty of Zand followed on the death of Mdir. Its great ornament, the wise and just Wakil, finds an impartial admirer in Sir John Malcolm; while Sir Harford Jones is a warm sympathiser in the misfortunes of the chivalrous but ill-starred Lutf 'Aly Khan, the last of his race. On the fall of the house of Zand, the Kajars, the present dynasty of Persia, rose to power; and the materials for their history are abundant. Englishmen have reason to be proud of the labours of their country men in Persia during the present century. Sir John Malcolm s Mission to Tehran, in 1810, not only resulted in his own valuable ' History,' but also bore rich fruit in the geographical memoir of Kinneir; and the travels of Pottinger, Lindsay, Christie, and Grant. From thexii PREFACE. days of Malcolm the labours of Englishmen on the his tory and geography of Persia and Central Asia have been unceasing. We have the works of Harford Jones, of Ouseley, of Porter, of Morier, and of Fraser; which brings us to the death of Fat-h 'Aly Shah in 1834. Mr. J. B. Fraser also wrote an historical account of Persia ' from the earliest ages to the present time,' for the Edinburgh Cabinet Library (1834). Since the death of Fat-h ' Al y Shah, a number of travellers have pub lished their narratives. Todd, Monteith, Eawlinson, Sheil, Abbott, Selby, and several other officers have supplied most valuable information respecting the various provinces of Persia in the Koyal Geographical and Eoyal Asiatic Societies' Eastwick, Bin ning, Stocqueler, Loftus, Layard, De Bode, Colonel Stuart, Lady Sheil, and Mounsey, have given us in teresting narratives of their travels through or residence in Persia; and Captain Hunt has published a clear and soldier-like account of the operations in the Persian Gulf in 1856-57. Quite recently, the labours of Sir Frederic Goldsmid, Majors St. John, Lovett, Euan Smith, and Mr. Blanford, have thrown a flood of light on the geology and geography of Persia. With the aid of these rich materials, and of the Treaties, Blue Books, Asiatic and other sources, the outline of Persian history has been brought down from the death of Agha Muhammad, where Malcolm's ' History' ends, to the present year.PREFACE. xiii The History of Persia from 1800 1858, by Mr. Watson, is very accurate; and its value is increased by the fact that the author had access to the archives of the British Mission. He carefully tested the truth of Persian statements, by comparing them with the accounts given by European authorities. But his work only treats of a period of sixty years; and there is no condensed narrative of Persian annals, covering the whole ground, and in a convenient form for reference. The present book is intended to supply this want. It has also been thought desirable to introduce a chapter on the geography and history of the Persian Gulf, the principal authorities for which are the selections from the Proceedings of the Bomba and the writings of that learned and accurate scholar, the Eev. George P. Badger; and another on Central Asia. Moorcroft, Burnes, Wood, Abbott, Conolly, Ferrier, Khanikoff, Vambery, Pedchenko, and others, have made vis acquainted with Central Asia; the geography and history of which region had been almost a close.d book since the Emperor Bfiber wrote his charming The problems relating to Central Asian geography have more recently been fully discussed, in learned and ex haustive essays, by Sir Henry Eawlinson and Colonel Yule. In one of the Appendices, abstracts are given of the treaty engagements between Persia and England and Eussia, and of Baron Eeuter's Convention;xiv PREFACE. which, it has been thought, will be useful for future reference. From the earliest ages, the hordes of Turan have pressed upon the northern provinces of Persia; and a never-ending contest has prevailed between Irdn and T uran, between races represented on the one side by the hero Eustam, and on the other by his adversary Afrasiab. This contest is the earthly symbol of Zoroaster's doctrine of the two principles, Ormuzd and Ahriman—good and evil. In the modern history of Persia, these two antago nistic principles are represented by England and Kussia, the friend and the foe of Iran. The policy of England has been to strengthen the power, and ensure the independence of Persia; and (though Mr. Canning, in 1826, evaded the obligations of a treaty, and deserted the Shah in his utmost need) she has, on the whole, been the true friend of Iran. Our advice has ever been that her Government should devote itself to internal improvements, and to the amelioration of the condition of the country, and refrain from schemes of foreign conquest. When, too, the folly and insolence of our semi-barbarous ally forced us into hostilities, we proved an unwilling and a generous foe; we did not rob Persia of an inch of her territory, nor a dinar of her money, nor exact unnecessarily humiliating conditions, on the conclusion of peace. Eussia, on the contrary, has proved herself a modernPREFACE. XV Tviran—the spirit of evil, the enemy of Mn. Adopting an insidious policy, she has laboured, by means of bribery and intrigue, to undermine the power and inde pendence of her neighbour. She has encouraged the Persian Government in ruinous and useless contests on the side of Herat; and, after she herself had engaged in unjust wars with Persia, at the conclusion of the treaties of peace in 1814 and 1828, she tore large and important provinces from her defeated enemy, excluded the vessels of the Shah from the navigation of the Caspian, and saddled a debt of several millions upon the already impoverished State. Since the latter date, the Eussians have maintained their influence in Persia by bribery, encroachments, and threats. It remains to be seen whether the kingdom of Persia will retain her independence by embracing a close alliance with England, her true friend in peace, and generous foe in war; or whether she will succumb to the intrigues of her aggressive neighbour, who has always proved a bad friend, and an ungenerous enemy; eventually falling under the grinding yoke of the Northern Ahriman.NOTE on THE TRANSLITERATION OF ORIENTAL NAMES. The most eligible transliteration of Eastern names and words is still, unhappily, a qucestio vexata ; and until a uni form system is generally recognised the existing divergence among authors will be perpetuated. Not professing to be a critical orientalist myself, and yet appreciating the import ance of the subject, I have sought the aid of others in my essay to transcribe Oriental names in European characters as correctly as possible, without endangering, by pedantic trans- figurement, the easy recognition of old forms in a new dress. In the first four chapters I have, for the most part, followed the hitherto prevailing method, the main peculiarity of which is the use of the acute accent (') over a vowel to denote prolongation, except in the case of incidental Arabic names which have been rendered somewhat differently. For the names of the Sassanian Kings I have followed Mr. Thomas. The attempt to combine the two systems has, however, damaged the uniformity of both; and as from page 102, where the History of the Khalifahs begins, and onward to the end of the work, Arabic terminology predominates, I judged that I could not do better than adopt the usage devised by the Eev. Gr. P. Badger, D .C .L., allowedly a com petent authority in what relates to that language. Through a 2xviii NOTE ON THE TKANSLITERATION. Dr. Badger's courtesy, I am enabled to set before the reader the following rationale of his system :— 6 My main object has been to convey the correct sound, and, as far as may be, to preserve the etymology of Arabic words, without resorting to unfamiliar -expedients, such as the use of arbitrary diacritical points, &amp;c. 6 Nobody can be more aware than I am that neither of these ends can be perfectly attained without the aid of devices of some kind to indicate the sound of those Arabic letters which are foreign to our language. But bearing in mind that persons unacquainted with Arabic would undoubtedly fail to pronounce such words correctly even with that help, I have eschewed resorting to it, resting satisfied at present with giving, through Eoman letters, the nearest approach to the right sound practically attainable by the generality of English readers. 6 1 represent both the ^ and ^—two radically different letters, the first a deep pectoral, and the second a slight aspirate—by our h. Whenever the latter occurs as the feminine termination of a word, and preceded by the vowel as in Mekkah, Jezirah, the h is nearly mute, as in our heir, hour. a sibilant, and a faucial, I represent by s; and t, the former our £, and the latter like the same letter as more emphatically enunciated by Irishmen, by t\ and (J and cS —ihe first a guttural and the second like our h—by that letter only. 6 The other Arabic letters, which have no equivalents in our language, are J, ^ k, c, and The sounds of ^ and are expressed nearly enough for all practical purposes by kh and dh respectively. J I write dz and )a zh, by way of distinguishing them, and also for etymology's sake, rather than because the expedients convey any very clear idea of the proper native sounds. Those who are puzzled by the combinations may content themselves with pronouncing both as 0. In order, however, to prevent the bizarre appearance of four consonants coming together in the transliterationOF ORIENTAL NAMES. xix into English, whenever either of these four letters is double in the Arabic, I separate the combinations by a hyphen ; thus, fakh-khar, nadh-dhadh, kadz-dzaf, mundzh-zham. Fortunately, such words are of rare occurrence. 4 1 adopt the same expedient with ^—adequately repre-* rented by sh —when that letter is doubled; thus, hash-shdsh, fash-shar. Also, when it occurs at the end of a syllable and is followed by A, as in Mdsh-had, which, otherwise, English readers might pronounce Ma-shad, And, again, when a syllable ends with h and the succeeding one begins with s, as in Ah-dd, ' The guttural ^ I express by gh, and the ^ with an apo strophe before the vowels a, i, u, when they follow that letter in the Arabic, as 'Abd, 'Irak, 'Ulamd, Sand'a, and after the vowels when it occurs at the end of a word or syllable, as rahia\ Rddha\ ez-Zaila\ ' The remaining Arabic consonants correspond generally with those of the English alphabet. The sound of our e, as in cat, being supplied by my use of fc, I only resort to it, conjoined with A, to express the Persian which is equiva lent to our ch in Charles. ' There are only three vowels in Arabic, in sound like a, i, u, in far, pit, lunar, respectively. The Arabic equivalent of a takes, in some positions, the sound of e in beg —a gram matical nicety seldom correctly observed; and I should have preferred expressing the corresponding Arabic vowel sound always by a; but the use of the e has so long prevailed, especially in writing the definite article el (properly, aV), and such words as Ahmed and Jezirah (correctly, Ahmady Jaztrah), that I have, regrettingly, retained it in such cases. For the same reason I have retained the vowel o in names which have become familiar by long usage, such, as 'Omar^ 'Oman, 'Othman, which should severally begin with 'U. ■ 6 To indicate the prolongation of a vowel, I place over it the familiar circumflex ( A ), as in Bukhara, Turdn, Baghdad, in preference to the acute accent (') recently sanctioned byNOTE ON THE TRANSLITERATION the Grovernment of India, whereby the hitherto universal use of that accent by English lexicographers to denote where a syllable should be accentuated is overlooked, and its utility lost. I retain it with that object, which is one of great importance in the pronunciation of Eastern names. Thus, Kdjar, Mdskat, Ldhej, are severally marked as requiring the accentual emphasis to be given to the first syllable. 6 The Arabic diphthongs are ai, ei, au, in sound like ie in pie, ei in vein, and oiv in how. When doubled in the same word, I express the au by aww, as in Tawivam. The Arabic suffix ^ when used to denote an ordinary or gentilic adjective, I represent by y, which ^ somewhat in the same way constitutes the formative of many of our English adjectives, as windy from wind, stormy from storm. I prefer this expedient to that which has recently been adopted, of expressing the suffix by a circumflexed i (as in Hindi), because that mark is generally used, as I use it, to denote a prolonged vowel, from which this adjective termi nation differs very essentially. The y in such cases should be pronounced with a ringing Italian i sound. c I notice, lastly, that in addition to the use made of the apostrophe, as stated above, I avail myself of it, as in English, to denote the elision of a letter, as in won't. Its utility is great in this respect, especially in transliterating compound Arab names, which generally require to be put into the con struct case. Thus, 'Abd-el-Majid, Nasir-ed-Din, 'Abd-er- Rahmdn, should be written and pronounced 'Ahdw~l~Majid, Nasm-d-Din, 'Abdu-'r-Rahman, the apostrophe represent ing the elision of the e of the article, in its different forms here presented of el, ed, er, and the junction in one syllable of the u, the final vowel denoting the nominate of the nouns Abd and Nasir, with the I, or second letter of the article, which remains. But however correct and desirable this style may be, I do not advocate its adoption in names which have become familiar to the ordinary English reader under a different form. i\0OF OMENTAL NAMES. xxi € I wish it to be understood that my system is tentative only, and designed to facilitate the introduction of a perfect transliteration of Arabic into Eoman characters, which shall correctly represent not the sonnd only, but also the etymology of the former language/ If in the portion of the book already referred to I have knowingly departed from Dr. Badger's system, it has been mainly in respect of those Oriental names which, by familiar usage hitherto, are more readily recognisable amongst us in a less correct form than that which he provides. Besides these, however, there will doubtless be found, in the multi plicity of Eastern words and names recorded, numerous errors and inconsistencies, for which I must crave the indulgence of the reader and critic.xxiv ANALYTICAL TABLE OF CONTENTS.

CHAPTER I. paishdadian dynasty. T he chief authority for the early history of Persia is the famous poet Perdosi. His Shah-Nameh is founded on the most ancient traditions, embellished by his own rich imagination. Malcolm's history of the more' re mote ages is taken chiefly from Perdosi, but also from the Arabian work called Zin and from a work called the Dabistan, written by Mohsin Pani, a native of Kashmir. But for actual historical facts we are dependent on Herodotus, Ctesias, and the other Grecian writers, and on a few inscriptions. Perdosi's work is thoroughly Persian, embodying all the national legends. His version is alone received , by the Persians themselves, and some knowledge of it is essential to a comprehension of their universally received notions of their own history. The lb B2 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Narneh is not historical, but, like the Annals of Livius, it is national. 1 In the most remote times it leads us to one of the cradles of the human race, the mountainous districts around the snow-clad peak of Ararat, 2 where some of the descendants of Shem still dwelt, and peopled Media—the modern province of Azerbaijan. They rapidly became rude and ignorant, until a king arose amongst them, named Kaiomurs, who is said to have been the son of Yessan Azum, the son of Elam, the son of Shem. Kaiomurs was sumamed or the 'Just Judge,' and the dynasty he founded is called the dadian. He reclaimed the people from barbarism, taught them to live in villages, and erected courts of justice; and it was not long before many neighbouring tribes, hearing of the blessings of his rule, placed themselves under his protection. He sent his brother into the distant East, to visit these new provinces, and 1 An account of Ferdosi and his work will be given in a future chapter. The Shah-Nameh was translated, with parallel Persian text, by Jules Mohn. (4 vols. Paris, 1838.) 2 There is no doubt that Mount Ararat, near Erivan, is not the Ararat of Noah; nor was it ever said to be so until within the last 500 years. It was an invention of Armenian priests.

Hushang is often said to B 2 U.4 HISTORY OF PERSIA. have been the founder of a religion ; but there can be little doubt that the more thoughtful Persians wor shipped a supreme God, and continued to do so for ages. It is indeed very remarkable that, of all the nations in the world, Persia is the only one that has never, at any period of her history, worshipped graven images of any kind. The Vedic elemental faith was succeeded by the creed of Zoroaster, which was super seded by Islamism. Sir William Jones observes that ' the primeval religion of Iran was that which Newton calls the oldest of all religions': ' A firm belief that one supreme God made the world by His power, and continually governs it by His providence ; a pious fear, love, and adoration of Him ; a due reverence for parents and aged persons; a fraternal affection for the whole human species, and a compassionate tenderness even for the brute creation.' 1 Hushang founded Susa, and subdued the people on the shores of the Persian Gulf; thus his empire ex tended over the present kingdom of Persia. In the north were Azerbaijan, or Media, a moun tainous district whence the first Paishdadian settlers had originally come; the fertile little province of Ghilan; and the forest-covered mountains of Elburz, running through the province of Mazanderan, near the shores of the Caspian Sea. Further to the East was a line of pastures and hilly country extending towards 1 Sir William Jones's Works, vol. i. p. 87.PAISHDADIAN DYNASTY. 5 Balkh, and bounded on the North by the deserts of Turan, and on the south by the salt desert of Kerman : this is the province of Khorassan. In the east and south-east part of Persia is a vast salt desert, 400 miles long and 200 broad, abounding in salt marshes, and crusted with a coat of brittle earth, interspersed with rocky ridges. It extends to the province of Sistan, which here divides Persia from Afghanistan. The valleys of central Persia abound in valuable vegetables and fruits, and rich pastures, and the orchards produce every kind of fruit known in Europe. From Hamadan (the ancient Ecbatana) to Shiraz, near Persepolis, there is a lofty chain of mountains, with several majestic peaks capped with perpetual snow. On the western side are spurs of hills, crowned with oaks and walnut trees, and well-watered valleys, possessing a generous soil, and pro ducing pomegranates, cherries, figs, vines, corn, barley, and excellent pastures for sheep and cattle. On the eastern side is a lofty plateau. In this range of mountains rise the rivers Kariin and Kerkhab, which fall into the Persian Gulf; and on their south-west side a vast plain extends to the Shat- el-Arab, 1 and Tigris. Here the ancient city of Susa was built. The narrow strip of arid and level country which extends from the mouth of the river Karun, along the shores of the Persian Gulf, resembles Arabia in soil and climate. It consists of a succession of sandy plains, with occasionally a large plantation of date palms, near 1 After the Tigris and Euphrates unite, the river is called el-Arab.6 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. the wells and fresh water rivulets, which are thinly- scattered over this barren region. Hushang ruled over this country, so diversified with fertile valleys, rich plains, lofty mountains, and barren deserts, for many years, and was at last killed in an attack upon some barbarians, when a large rock was thrown upon him. He was succeeded by Tahamurs, who died at Balkh after a long reign; and the crown of Persia then descended upon the head of the renowned Jam- shid. Jamshid founded the famous city of Istakar, called by the Greeks Persepolis, 1 thirty-five miles from the modern town of Shiraz. He introduced the use of music and wine ; and invented a more correct method of calculating time by the solar year, in which, in the space of 130 years, a month was intercalated. New Year's day, called Noroz, was celebrated as a great religious festival. Many learned men from distant countries frequented his court; and it is said that Taou, the famous Chinese rationalist, and Pythagoras, the Greek philosopher, be came acquainted in the palace of Jamshid. At least, it is recorded that at nearly the same time, and in countries more than a thousand miles apart, Taou and Pythagoras both discovered the forty-seventh proposi tion of the first book of Euclid, and it is known that they both visited Persia. Jamshid was much helped in the business of 1 Called also Tukt-e-Jamshid, the 1 throne of Jamshid.'

Persia was invaded, from the west, by a prince named Zohak with a great army, who defeated the forces of Iran, and the unfortunate Jamshid fled to Sistan, and there married a daughter of the prince of the country, and became the ancestor of the heroic Eustam. 1 He was, however, at length captured, and put to a cruel death by order of Zohak—who had him sawn in two with a fish's bone. 2 Zohak was a cruel tyrant, with a meagre pallid face and wild sparkling eyes.

Among his victims were the sons of a blacksmith named Kaf, who ran up and down the street of his native town, crying out for vengeance upon the tyrant, and waving his apron in the air. He soon collected a large army, defeated Zohak in a great battle, and besieged him in a castle of Azerbaijan, still known by his name. 1 The tyrant was captured and confiaed for life in a cave amongst the mountains of Elburz; and the noble blacksmith Kaf placed Feridun, the son of Abten, the son of Jamshid, on the throne. Malcolm believes that the tyranny of Zohak is intended to represent the period of Assyrian domi nation ; and Sir H. Eawlinson suggests that the notices of Persians, in the cuneiform inscriptions of Assyria, ' will go far to verify the suspicion of the subjection of the race to the Assyrian yoke being figured under the tyrannical rule of Zohak; and will enable us, in the end, to introduce something like accuracy and order into the traditions embodied in the Shah-Nameh.' 2 On the death of Jamshid, Feridun had been con cealed by his mother in the mountains of Elburz, where the royal child was nourished by a cow, named Purmaiah; and, in remembrance of this, he carried an iron mace with a cow's head on it (called 1 Colonel Monteith's Journal in Azerbaijan 2 Eawlinson's Commentary on syria (1853).

The apron of the blacksmith Kaf, the saviour of his country, became the Eoyal standard of Persia, and remained so until it was captured by the Muhammadans in the fatal battle of Cadesia, a thousand years after wards. It was called Darafsh-e-Kdwani (' Standard of Kaf'), and was covered with jewels. Peridiin was a great and wise king. He married a daughter of Zohak, and had two sons, Selm and Tur. On her death he married secondly the beau tiful Iran Dukht, or Daughter of Iran, and had a son named Erij. When the king became very old, he divided his empire amongst his sons, giving Selm the Western country, Tur the Eastern, while to Erij, the son of his beloved Iran-Dukht, he gave Persia. But the two elder brothers were discontented, and reproached their father with injustice. Erij resolved 1 On the overthrow of Zohak, his two grandchildren, named Snri and Sam, fled to Nevahend; and eventually the latter fled, with his wife and children, and ten horsemen, to the mountains of Ghori, where he built the castle of Zumyandesh. At the time of the Prophet Muhammad, Ghori was ruled by Shist, a descendant of Shuja, son of Sam, who was converted to Islamism. Amir Yahye, descended from Shist, was contemporary with Harvln-er- Eashid. His descendant Muhammad Ghori, overthrew the Ghazna- vide dynasty, and conquered Lahore. He invaded India in 1191, and was defeated by the Eajahs of Delhi and Ajmir, at a place eighty miles from Delhi. He fled to Lahore. Pithau Eai of Ajmir collected 800,000 horse and 3,000 elephants on the former field of battle; and Muhammad Ghori utterly defeated him. Muhammad Ghori's two slaves became the rulers of Delhi and Bengal.—From Ferishta,PAISHDADIAN DYNASTY. 11 to give up his share of empire, rather than be the cause of dissension which afflicted his father. He, therefore, repaired to the camp of his brothers to make the offer, but was cruelly murdered by them. The unfortunate prince implored them to spare his life, exclaiming— Will you ever allow it to be recorded That you, possessing life, deprive others of that blessing ? Pain not the ant that drags the grain along the ground, It has life, and life is sweet and delightful to all to whom it belongs. But they showed him no mercy, and sent his head to their father Feridun. The old man fainted at the sight, and when he recovered, he exclaimed—- ' May they never more enjoy a bright day! May the demon Eemorse tear their savage bosoms! As for me, I only desire from God that gave me life, that he will continue it till a descendant shall arise from the race of Erij to avenge his death.' The daughter of Erij, named Peri-cheher (or ' Fairy Facewas married to Pushung, a nephew of Feridun, and their son, Menucheher, was the image of his grandsire, Erij. He was the cherished hope of his father, and of old Feridun, who brought him up and educated him carefully. At length, he was old enough to take the field against his wicked uncles, 1 and de feated them, killing both Selm and Tur. From 1 The brothers, fearing the prowess of Menucheher, sent an em bassy with costly presents to Feridun, to avert the approaching storm. Feridun showed the envoy his great warriors: Gavar (Kaf),HISTOKY OF PERSIA. the name Turan is derived, whose wildernesses were peopled by his descendants. On his death the aged Feridun left the throne to Menucheher, saying : ' Believe, my son, that every day of your life is a leaf in your history. Take care, therefore, that nothing be written in it which is not fit for posterity to see.' Feridun was the greatest monarch of the Paish- dadian Dynasty, and the Persian poet thus speaks of him: 'The happy Feridun was not made of musk and amber. By his justice and generosity he gained great and good ends. Be thou just and generous, and thou shalt be a Feridun.' Menucheher was a wise prince, and turned many wildernesses into fertile plains, by making aqueducts and cutting water courses. The aqueducts were made and his two sons Shahpuar and Shirueh, and Kariin, and Sam, and Nariman ; and then the old monarch indignantly exclaimed; Hence with your presents, hence away, Can gold or gems turn night to day ? Shall gold a father's heart entice Blood to redeem beyond all price ? Hence, hence with treachery ; I have heard Their glowing falsehoods every word. The brothers of my murdered boy Who could a father's hope destroy, An equal punishment will reap And lasting vengeance o'er them sweep.

They form the province of Khorassan, n y which is bounded on the north by the Turkoman c t s Desert (or desert of Turan), and on the south by the c | e great salt desert of Kerman. From time immemorial the wild roving tribes to the md north have periodically invaded Khorassan, sometimes only making insignificant predatory excursions, but at others they have come in such numbers as to overrun the whole of Persia. Such were the invasions of Afrasiab, Togrul Beg, and Zengis Khan. In the reign of Menucheher, Afrasiab, king of Turan, a descendant of Tur, invaded Khorassan with a great army ; and, after a long war, was finally driven back by Sam, the king's minister and general. Afra siab agreed to confine himself, for the future, in the territory between the rivers Oxus and Jaxartes (Sihun 1 Called Kanats.i . ■ 14 HISTOKY OF PERSIA. and Jihun). A place called Tash-kurghan, on the eastern slope of the Pamir, is still called the city of Afrasiab. 1 The prosperity of Menucheher was owing to the wisdom and courage of his minister Sam, who was Prince of Sistan. This minister, and his renowned son and grandson, Zal and Eustam, were all Princes of Sistan; and for many years their lives formed a more prominent part of Persian history than those of the kings whom they served. Sistan, a province between Persia and Afghanistan, is a flat country, with low hills here and there. One third of its surface is moving sand, and the other two thirds are composed of compact sand and clay, rich in vegetable matter, and covered with woods of tamarisk and saghes, 2 reeds, and abundant pasture. The Helmund, 3 rising in the mountains near Kabul, flows into Sistan, and empties itself into the lake of Zirreh. 4 It is by far the finest river between the Tigris and the Indus. In the first part of its course it flows through scarped defiles, and is ob- 1 Tasli-kurghan is a very remarkable place. No English tra veller has ever been there; but Sir Henry Eawlinson has collected all that is known about it, in a note to his Monograph on the Oxus, R. G. S.

It was formerly called Saghestan, and its true etymology is the country of the Sagan or Sacse. 3 Etymander of the Greeks. 4 Sistan, in the Behistiin Inscription, is called Zor aha, or i the Lake Country.'m PAISHDAD1AN DYNASTY, 15 t ^ e structed by enormous masses of rock, but a little above y Girishk it is less confined, and is turned to account in irrigating the plain.

One day, as he was following the chase amongst the wild mountains near Kabul, he came to a lonely tower, on the summit of which was a beautiful damsel. They gazed upon each other and fell in love, but there was no way of getting up. At last the lady loosened her hair, which was so long that it reached the ground, and thus the young Prince ascended. The lady proved to be Eudabeh, 1 a daughter of Mihrab, 2 king of Kabul, who consented to their mar riage. Zal and Eudabeh were the parents of Eustam, the great hero of ancient Persian history. The Simurgh assisted at his birth. Af ter a long and prosperous reign, Menucheher was succeeded by his son Nudar. During his time, Afra- siab again invaded Persia, and the aged Sam died while marching to resist him. The King of Turan 1 Ferdosi thus describes Rudabeh : Her name Eudabeh; screened from public view, Her countenance is brilliant as the sun; From head to foot her lovely form is fair As polished ivory.

But, in the meanwhile, Zal collected an army, and after a bloody war, which ove ' brought famine and pestilence in its train, he forced My Afrasiab to retreat into Turan, and placed Zab, the lawful heir, upon the throne of Persia. Zab was a good prince, though fond of eating, and he invented r of several kinds of sauces and broths.

Thus ended the Paishdadian dynasty, that of the earliest rulers of Persia, who lived in times so very distant that many writers have believed the whole of their history to be fabulous. Yet the universal tradi tions of a country, and on such was Ferdosi's History founded, are generally based on truth; and at all events the rebellion of Kaf is not a fable, for his apron was captured by the Arabs in the fatal battle of Cadesia, and thus confirmed the truth of this event in the remote history of Persia.

F oe several years, while the barbarian King Afrasiab tyrannised over the conquered children of Iran, Zal the Prince of Sistan, brooded over the misfortunes of his country, and trained up his heroic son Eustam amongst the tamarisk woods on the banks of the Hel- mund. At length he succeeded in collecting a great army, composed of Persian fugitives ; and Eustam was sent to the fastnesses of the Elburz mountains, to invite Kai Kobad, a grandson of the Paishdadian King Menu-' cheher, to come from his concealment, and accept the crown. He encountered the fugitive Prince at the foot of the snowy peak of Demavend, and after a feast, during which the cup circulated freely, they proceeded to the camp of Zal, and Kai Kobad was proclaimed King of Iran, and thus founded the Kaianian dynasty. 1 Eustam then advanced against Afrasiab, with the cow-headed club of his grandsire Sam. He slew 1,160 enemies, and drove the armies of Turan beyond the 1 From Kai, an epithet signifying regal rank, which was prefixed to the names of several of their kings.

Kai Kobad enjoyed a long reign: and he was so famous for his justice, that during his life the people of Iran ceased to lament the death of Feridun. Kai Kobad 1 is believed to be the Dejoces of Grecian writers. He founded the city of Ecbatana, on a conical hill, in Azerbaijan, and surrounded it with seven walls, one inside the other, and overtopping each other by the battlements alone. These battlements were all of different colours : the first being white, the second black, the third scarlet, the fourth blue, the fifth orange, the sixth silver, and the seventh gold. 2 In the centre was a palace and a treasure-house, while the people were ordered to construct their dwellings round the outer wall. The plain in which it is situated, now called Takhti Soliman, when in the spring the Kai Kobad was tlie Dejoces of Grecian writers. Herodotus says :— 4 I shall follow the Persian historians, whose object it appears to be, not to magnify the exploits of Cyrus, but to relate the simple truth. There was a certain Mede named Dejoces, the son of Phraortes, a man of much wisdom, who had conceived to himself the desire of obtaining sovereign power.'— Booh I. The Grecian story of the rise of Dejoces is evidently fabulous. Grote says:— 4 Of the real history of Dejoces we cannot be said to know anything; for the interesting narrative ol Herodotus presents to us, in all points, Grecian society and ideas, not Oriental.' 2 ' The colours of the battlements are manifestly a fable of Sabaean origin; the seven colours mentioned by Herodotus being precisely those employed by the Orientals to denote the seven great heavenly bodies.'—Kawlinson's Herodotus, 1 Thus Dejoces collected the Medes into a nation and ruled over them alone. These are the tribes of the Medes: 1 Busse Par^taceni Struchates Arizanti Budii Magi.'— Herodotus,KAIANIAN DYNASTY. 21 rills descend from the mountains, is proverbial for its beauty throughout Persia. 1 Kai Kobad was succeeded by his son Kai Kaus, 2 the Cyaxares 3 of the Greeks, and the Arphaxad of the Book of Judith. The first act of this king's reign was the rash invasion of the mountainous districts of Maz- anderan, on the shores of the Caspian; but he was entirely defeated by his opponent, the Div Safid or White Demon, and cast into prison. 4 Eustam de termined to attempt his rescue, and mounted on his good horse Eeksh, he boldly entered the wild territory of the Divs. He entered Mazanderan alone, by a pass which winds round the snow-capped peak of Demavend. Here the Persian hero was surrounded by magnificent scenery. Bold and picturesque rocks of limestone, groves of oak trees, and deep ravines, with streams 1 Echatana means a treasure city. Two cities of this name became successively the capitals of Persia. The first one, built by Dejoces, may now be traced in the ruins on the hill at Takhti Soliman, in Azerbaijan. Sir H. Rawlinson has written a full and very interesting account of them. E. G. S. Journal, vol. x. p. 65. The second Echatana, where Yarahran, or Ahasuerus, held his court, is the same as the modern Persian town of Hamadan. 2 Dejoces was succeeded by his son Phraortes, who conquered the Persians. He was killed in a battle with the Assyrians of Nineveh. His son Cyaxares succeeded him. 8 Cyaxares was succeeded by his son Astyages. He had a daughter named Mandane, whom he married to a Persian of royal race, named Cambyses. Then follows in Herodotus, the story of the birth of Cyrus. 4 The army of Kai Kaiis is said to have been struck blind: and this is clearly the eclipse of the sun, which the Grecian writers say occurred when King Cyaxares fought the Lydians. It was foretold by the philosopher Thales.22 HISTORY OF PERSIA. dashing through them, surrounded him at every turn. In this country fruit trees abound, the birds sing very merrily, and beautiful trees, in great variety, clothe the hills, with vines twisting round them. 1 With the aid of Eeksh, Eustam penetrated far into this unknown and mysterious land; and overcame a lion, a serpent, a sorceress, a giant, an army of Divs, and lastly, the Div Safid himself. He then rescued Kai Kaiis, and restored him to his own dominions. But this foolish king had no sooner been released from one difficulty, than he plunged into another. His next act was to attack the king of Hamaveran, 2 and demand his daughter in marriage. But Kai Kaiis was taken prisoner, and Afrasiab immediately took the opportunity of crossing the Oxus with a great army. In this emergency Eustam was again called from Sistan to the rescue. The hero first defeated the king of Hamaveran, forcing him to give his daughter Sudabah to Kai Kaus ; and then advanced rapidly across Persia to oppose Afrasiab. Then it was that the famous episode occurred, which is called by the poet Ferdosi, ' A tale full of the waters of the eye.' In the days of his early youth Eustam had married a lady named Taminuh, but very shortly afterwards he left her to serve his country, through many glorious Colonel Stuart's Tour in Mazanderan. Maz means 1 mountains'; cmdevcin — c within 1 ; in the Pehlvi language. 2 Probably Assyria.KAIANIAN DYNASTY. 23 wars. She gave birth to a son named Zohrab, but fearing lest Eustam should claim him, she sent him word that it was a daughter. Before leaving her, however, Eustam took off his seal, charging her, if delivered of a son, to bind it on his arm as a token of recognition; and she obeyed this last injunction. When Zohrab grew up, though aware that Eustam was his father, he entered the service of Afrasiab, and in many battles carried terror into the Persian ranks. At length the two armies met on the banks of the Oxus. Zohrab challenged the bravest Persian hero to engage him in single combat, and Eustam, under a feigned name, stood forward between the opposing hosts. The duel that followed was long doubtful; but at length Eustam dealt his adversary a mortal blow with his terrible cow-headed club, and Zohrab sank to the ground. The unfortunate youth warned his con queror ' to shun the anger inspired by parental woes, and bade him dread the vengeance of the mighty Eustam.' 1 Zohrab proved his words by exposing the ring that his mother had fastened round his arm, and the wretched father was overwhelmed with grief. He permitted the army of Afrasiab to retire beyond the Oxus, and carried the corpse of his son into Sistan, where it was buried. 2 Kai Kaiis had a son, named Siawush, of a noble and generous disposition, but who had incurred the resent ment of his step-mother Sudabah, the daughter of the 1 Malcolm. 2 Translation of the Shah-Nameh by Robertson.24 HISTORY OF PERSIA. king of Hamaveran. She accused him to the king, and he was forced to seek safety at the court of Afra- siab, where he was received with joy. He first married a daughter of Piran Wisa, the minister; and after wards he obtained the beautiful Feringis, Afrasiab's own daughter, for his wife. He received the land of Chin, or Chinese Tartary, as his wife's dowry; and retired to its delightful capital Kang, 1 where, says Ferdosi, ' the warmth was not heat, and the coolness was not cold.' Here he passed his time, with his beloved Feringis, in improving the condition of the people ; until he was treacherously put to death by Gursivas, a brother of Afrasiab. He left a son, named Kai Khusru, who was also ordered to be murdered, but the little child was concealed by the good old minister, Piran Wisa. On hearing of the death of his son, remorse seized upon Kai Kaus, and, having put the wicked Sudabah to death, he marched an army into Turan to avenge the murder of the brave and generous young Siawush. The hero Eustam joined him from Sistan, and the armies of Afrasiab were again encountered near the Oxus. Eustam fought the bravest of the enemy, and hurled him back into the ranks of Turan. He then attacked and overcame Afrasiab himself, who retreated across the Oxus, and again ordered Kai Khusru to be sought out and put to a cruel death. 1 The ruins, which mark the site of this ancient capital, are near Yarkand.—Rawlinson's Monograph G. vol. xlii. p. 504. Sir Henry suggested {Jour. It. S., vol. x. pp. Ufi and 321)that Kung was a Pehlvi word, signifying ' heaven.'KAIANIAN DYNASTY. 25 But the young prince fled eastward from Turan, and is even said to have wandered beyond the sea of China. He was, however, at length discovered by a faithful Persian warrior, who led him home and restored him to the aged Kai Kaus. The old king re signed the throne to his grandson; but in his retire ment Kai Khusru paid him the greatest attention, and this conduct of the new king gladdened the hearts of his subjects. Kai Kaus is said to have been fond of astronomy; and in pursuit of this favourite science he neglected the affairs of his kingdom to such an extent, that Eustam once angrily said to him, ' Hast thou managed thy affairs so well on earth, that thou must needs med dle with those of heaven ?' It is generally supposed that the reigns both of Cyaxares and Astyages are comprised in that of Kai Kaiis, and that Kai Khusru was Cyrus the Great. 1 The final war with Afrasiab followed very soon after the accession of Kai Khusru. One day some peasants 1 Herodotus says, in the time of Cyrus, that Persia was made up of the following tribes : Pasagarda. The chief tribe. Also the name of Cyrus's capital. Achmnerddv.

A young nobleman and a great favourite of the king, named Bijun, volunteered to extirpate them; and he was accompanied, owing to his youth, by the warrior Gnrgin. Bijun killed many hogs, and Gurgin few; and the latter, wishing to get the tusks from his young comrade to present to the king, determined to lay a trap for him. As they were sitting on a hill which commanded an extensive view towards Turan, Gur gin told young Bijun that he was the most valiant of heroes, and described the distant valley where the beautiful Muneja, the daughter of Afrasiab, resided. He said: ' Seest thou yon valley of variegated hues, what a scene to fill the heart of a valiant man with joy ! Behold the sweet groves, beautiful gardens, and flowing streams. The stalk of the lily bends under the weight of the flower, and the whole grove is charmed with the fragrance of the rose bushes. See how the graceful pheasant moves among the flowers, while the doves and the nightingales warble from the branches of the cypress. Behold Muneja, daughter of Afrasiab, who, like the sun, irradiates the garden. If you make one day's journey forward, you will reach the beautiful valley.' 1 The temptation was too strong for young Bijun, who advanced into Turan, and was captured by the guards of Afrasiab. He was thrown into a pit, and his life was 1 Ferdosi.kaianian dynasty. 27 only preserved by the secret attentions of Muneja, who was touched by his youth and his devotion for her. On receiving tidings of the misfortune of his young favourite, Kai Khusru, being joined by Eustam, ad vanced with a great army towards Turan. The first place they attacked was the fortress of Kelat, in Khor- assan, about thirty miles n.e . of the present city of Meshed; which was defended by Ferud, a son of Siawush, by the daughter of Piran Wisa, and there fore half brother to Kai Khusru. Kelat 1 is situated on a very high hill, only accessible by two narrow paths. On the summit there is a plain, twelve miles in circumference, well watered and covered with verdure. Ferud was killed in defending his castle, and the hosts of Iran crossed the Oxus. Here they encountered the army of Turan, commanded by old Piran Wisa; and a great battle was fought. 2 The aged minister was killed, Afrasiab fled, and his ally, the Emperor of China, riding on a white elephant, was taken prisoner. Kai Khusru then advanced into Turan, captured all its cities, and Afrasiab, after a very long reign passed in continual wars against Persia, after wandering about for months on the shores of the Caspian, was finally put to death. 1 The birthplace of Nadir Shah. * Kai Khusru, beholding the field of battle, exclaimed ' hud, (I have my desire).

After a reign of sixty years, he resigned his crown to his adopted son Lohrasp, his own by affection; and devoted the re mainder of his life to religious exercises. He is said to have retired to the banks of a stream in Azerbaijan, where he disappeared. Kai Khusru 1 was a great and good, as well as a very successful prince. Tires were lighted during his reign, on the mountains of Elburz, as emblems of light and goodness ; and he also seems to have believed in the God of the Jews. For when Isaiah wrote con cerning this king, he spoke of him as ' my Shepherd, who shall perform all my pleasure ;' 2 and when Daniel told Cyrus of this saying, the king readily testified his obedience and sincere belief that there was one true God: as afterwards appeared in his edict restoring the Jews. 3 Lohrasp, 4 after a short reign, retired to a valley near Balkh, and became an ascetic in a Buddhist temple, 1 Or Cyrus. 2 Isaiah xliv. 28, xlv. 1, and 1 my anointed.'' 8 Ezra i. 2. 4 Cambyses, on the death of his father Cyrus (by Cassandan^) took the kingdom. b.c. 527 or b.c. 525 he invaded Egypt. After killing the calf-god Apis, Cambyses became mad. He sent to Susa, and caused his full brother Smerdis to be killed. He had a passion for wine. While he still lingered in Egypt, two Magi (brothers) revolted. One was Patizeithes, the other pretended to be Smerdis, whose death was concealed from the people. When Cambyses heard it, he sprang on his horse, meaning to lead his army to Susa, but his sword slipped out of the scabbard and killed him. Cambyses reigned seven years, and left no children.— Herodotus.KAIANIAN DYNASTY. 29 leaving the throiie to his son Gushtasp, 1 the Darius Hystaspes of Grecian writers; in whose reign the so- called Zoroaster arose, the reformer of the religion of Iran. Gushtasp, also, built the famous palace at Persepolis, near Istakar, the city of Jamshid, and made it his principal residence. Persepolis is situated in a plain, eighteen leagues long and four broad, watered by the river Bendemir 1 Gushtasp was probably the Darius Hystaspes of the Greeks. Herodotus relates that, after the death of Cambyses, a Persian noble named Otanes, discovered, through his daughter, that the Magian usurper was not Smerdis.

The palace, built by Jamshid at the N.E. end of the plain, and enlarged by Gushtasp, is described in an oriental work called the Zinut-ul-Mujalis Jamshid built a fortified palace at the foot of a hill, which bounds the fine plain of Mardasht to the N.E., and is called Koh -i -Rah or the ' Hill of Mercy.' The platform on which it was built has three faces to the plain, and one to the mountain. It is formed of a hard crystalline limestone, and every stone used in this building is from nine to twelve feet long, and broad in proportion. The stones are exquisitely joined together, and are often, if not invariably, hollow. There are two great flights of stairs to this palace, so easy of ascent that a man can ride up them on horse back ; and on the platform several temples were erected. ' Some most beautiful and extraordinary figures ornament this palace; and all the pillars which once supported the roof are composed of three pieces of Twenty Governments of Darius: 1.

Standing figures, in long robes, with short spears^ fluted caps, and a quiver and bow, are sculptured on the walls of the staircases; and the sides of the terraces are ornamented with admirable bas-reliefs. The plat form is now covered with broken shafts, capitals, and fragments of building ornamented with exquisite sculp ture. Each pillar is formed of carved stone, and is ornamented in a manner so delicate that it would seem difficult to rival it in a carving upon the softest wood. The pillars, before their destruction, were six deep every way, in four divisions, but only ten are now standing. Their height was sixty feet, fluted in fifty-two divisions, with pedestals in the form of the cup and leaf of the lotus, and capitals surmounted by double demi-bulls. J. he face of the mountain behind this beautiful palace is ornamented with sculpture, and there are two tombs cut in the rOck. One of them has four pilasters, with double-headed unicorns for capitals, supporting an architrave. Inside there is a chamber, forty-six feet long, and having three cells for bodies on one side. It is remarkable that there are no remains of a city close to the ruined palace, which was probably only used as a summer retreat, with magnificent temples and a place of royal sepulture. The ruins are four miles from the remains of the city of Istakar. The abode of the King of Iran was enriched with ivory, silver, and amber; and his golden throne was placed under a canopy, supported by four pillars. Large gardens and parks surrounded the palace; its halls32 HISTORY OF PERSIA. were thronged with Persian nobles, and the splendid feasts were enlivened by music and the songs of women. On certain occasions the humblest peasant could bring his complaint to the personal notice of his sovereign, who sat in state with a crown on his head, and a purple band, an emblem of royalty, round his forehead. The princes and noble youths of Persia were taught justice, prudence, fortitude, and clemency by the learned men; and, as Herodotus says, from their earliest youth they learnt to manage a horse, use the bow, 1 and speak the truth. 2 While Gushtasp was adorning and beautifying the palace of Jamshid, the reformer Zoroaster is said to have first made his appearance in the mountains of Azerbaijan. But the difficult questions relating to the time he lived and to the religion he established will be discussed separately in the next chapter. The young Prince Isfandiar, son of Gushtasp, a great warrior who extended the arms of Persia into the remotest lands of the West, 3 was one of the first to embrace the faith of Zoroaster, and when Arjasp, king 1 Isaiah speaks of the 1 quiver of Elam.' 3 4 Th^ir sons are carefully instructed, from their fifth to their twentieth year, in three things alone—to ride, to draw the bow, and to speak the truth.'— Herodotus. 3 Isfandiar was the Xerxes of the Greeks. The Oriental his torians scarcely mention the invasion of Greece, and the defeats and disasters he met with. It is probable that the war, so glorious for the Greeks, was never generally known about in Persia; just as many Frenchmen, when the Allies were at Paris, had never heard of Trafalgar. The numbers of the army of Xerxes, 1,000,000 men, must have been a gross exaggeration.KAIANIAN DYNASTY. 33 of Turan, refused to abandon his idolatry, Isfandiar prepared to make war upon him. But Arjasp is said to have suddenly invaded Persia, seized the city of Balkh, and put the holy Zoroaster, and many other priests, to the sword. His triumph was, however, of short duration. Isfandiar advanced against him, and retook Balkh, defeating and killing the King of Turan. He then prepared to invade Sistan, where the old warrior Eustam had refused to embrace the faith of Zoroaster. The hero was most unwilling to fight with Isfandiar ; but at length they met in single combat on the banks of the lake of Zirreh, and the king's son was killed. His dying request was that Eustam would educate his son Bahman ; and the body of the young prince was conveyed to Balkh. But the glorious career of Eustam, the greatest of Persia's heroes, was drawing to a close. Through the treachery of a Prince of Kabul, he fell into a pit that had been dug for him, with his faithful horse Eeksh, and his dying act was to transfix his murderers with an arrow. His son Feramurz was driven out of Sistan; but his grandson, named Azer-ba-zin (literally 'fire upon the saddle'), recovered the patrimony of his ancestors. On hearing of the death of his son, the old king died after a very long reign, and was succeeded by his grandson Bahman, the son of Isfandiar. Gushtasp, or Darius, was ' a prince of wisdom, clemency, and justice, and has the honour of having his name recorded in Holy Writ as a favourer of God's D34 HISTORY OF PERSIA. people, and a promoter of his worship.' 1 He, as well as Cyrus, believed in the God of the Jews, for in his decrees relating to the temple at Jerusalem he ex presses as much. 2 Bahman, or Ardeshir Dirazdast (' long-handed'), the Artaxerxes Longimanus of the Greeks, and the Aha- suerus of the Bible, displayed great wisdom in the internal regulations of the empire, and was a just and good king. He deprived Belshazzar, 8 a wicked ruler, of the government of Babylon, and often resided in that famous city himself. But his favourite residence was at Ecbatana, the modern city of Hamadan, where he enjoyed the society of Esther, the beautiful Jewess. At Hamadan the face of the country is undulating, the soil rich, the water good, and the climate singularly clear, healthy, and bracing; with picturesque mountains at hand, for retirement during the heat of summer. The numerous plantations and gardens in the plain are watered by the streams that descend from the glaciers of Elwand. In the centre of Hamadan is the tomb of Esther and Mordecai. The entrance is by a low door, and the tomb occupies the whole of the internal space, leaving only a narrow passage for walking round. Jewish pilgrims, for a thousand years, have covered the walls with their names. 1 Prideaux's Connection, vol. i. p. 298. 2 Ezra vi. 9; and Ezra vi. 12, wliich is yet stronger. a This must have been some subordinate governor, and not the monarch who was killed a century before, by Darius the Mede.

In his reign Alexander the Great conquered Persia, and the Kaianian dynasty, the most glorious in Persian history, came to an end. During the period of its existence the Persians enjoyed a degree of happiness and prosperity far beyond what has ever been expe rienced since. The evils of despotism were checked by a powerful warlike nobility; manners were softened and refined by a spirit of chivalry which prevailed throughout the country, during the Kaianian dynasty; and the heroes of Iran are not praised more for their valour than for their clemency and munificence.

On his death his most able general, Seleucus (called Nicator, or 'the Conqueror') seized upon Syria and Persia, and for five centuries the children of Iran were oppressed by foreign conquerors. Seleucus was succeeded by Antiochus Soter, who was 1 Hormi means a 1 bird of Paradise.'

He declared that he had recovered the apron of the blacksmith Kaf. the revered standard of Iran, and thus induced the Persians to assist him. Arsaces fixed his residence at Ehe or Phages, near the modern city of Tehran ; and the chiefs of all the mountain tribes formed a confederacy under him, called the Muluk-ul-Sawdif, or the 'Commonwealth of Nations,' consisting of practically free feudatories. This was the Parthian kingdom of Roman writers. The Parthians are called by Strabo, Carduchi, or Kurds; and it is probable that their army consisted partly of the wild tribes of Kurdistan, and partly of warriors from the deserts of Turan. 2 They stemmed the torrent of Eoman conquest towards the East; their arrows and mode of warfare astonished and terrified the disciplined legions of Rome ; and Crassus, amongst others, was defeated and killed by the Parthian general Surena. They are scarcely mentioned by Ferdosi and other Oriental writers, and so few of their actions were re corded that the historian Khondemir exclaimed in des pair, ' God alone knoweth the truth.'

Afterwards that Cambyses slew Bardes. When Cambyses had slain Bardes, it was not known to the peopleTHE BEHISTUN INSCRIPTION. that Bardes was dead. Afterwards Cambyses proceeded to Egypt. Then the state became wicked. Then the lie became abound ing in the land, both in Persia and in Media, and in the other provinces. 11. i Says Darius the king. Afterwards there was a certain man named Gomates, a Magian. He thus lied to the state, ' I am Bardes, the son of Cyrus, the brother of Cambyses.' Then the whole state became rebellious. From Cambyses the state went over to him, both Persia and Media, and the other provinces. He seized the empire. Afterwards Cambyses, unable to endure it, died. 12. 1 Says Darius the king. The empire of which Gomates the Magiai\, dispossessed Cambyses, that empire from the olden time had been in our family. After Gomates the Magian had dis possessed Cambyses, he became king. 13. 1 The state feared Gomates the Magian exceedingly. He slew many people who had known the old Bardes. No one dared to say anything of Gomates the Magian till I arrived. Then I prayed to Ormuzd. Ormuzd brought help to me. Then, with my faithful men, I slew that Gomates the Magian, and those who were his chief followers. By the grace of Ormuzd I then became king, Ormuzd granted me the sceptre. 14. i The empire that had been taken away from our family I recovered. As it was before, so I made it. The temples which Gomates had destroyed I rebuilt. The sacred offices of the state, both the religious chants and worship, I restored to the people, which Gomates the Magian had deprived them of. 15. 4 Says Darius the king, this is what I did, after that I became king. 18. 1 Says Darius the king, then I went to Babylon, against that Nidiatabelus, who was called Nabochodrossar. The people held the Tigris, there they were posted, and there they had boats. I brought the enemy into difficulty, Ormuzd brought help to me. By the grace of Ormuzd I crossed the Tigris. Then I went to Babylon. We fought a battle. Ormuzd brought help unto me. The enemy were driven into the water, the water destroyed them. Then I took Babylon, and slew that Nidiatabelua, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.'43 CHAPTER III, the zend avesta. I f the Vedas are the most ancient extant writings of which we have any knowledge, the Persian Gathas undoubtedly rank next in antiquity. In them we first find the dawn of a higher and purer worship than the deification of the elements ; and to them, therefore, we must turn for those conceptions of an Almighty Creator and a future life, of which but faint traces are to be found in the Vedic Hymns. At the outset it is necessary to bear in mind that the Vedic Aryans and the ancient Persians were essentially the same people; that originally their religion was iden tical ; and that there is as httle difference between Sanscrit and Zend as between Attic and Doric or Ionic Greek. Herodotus, as is well known, gives some account of the religion of the Magi. Ctesias, the physician of Artaxerxes, Deinon, Theopompos of Chios, and Her- mippos 1 the Peripatetic, all wrote on the same subject; 1 Said by Pliny to have translated the Zend Avesta, He was a learned scholar of Alexandria.44 history of persia. but their works are lost, though fragments have been preserved by Plutarch, Pliny, Cornelius Nepos, and others. Strabo, in his fifteenth book, Pausanias, and Agathias also wrote accounts of the Magian religion. Among the Arabs, Masudi ( a.d . 950) gave some notices of the sacred books of the Parsees ; and Shahrastani of Baghdad, a writer on religious creeds ( a.d . 1153), had a better opinion of that of the Magi than most other Moslem writers. But we gather little or nothing that is really authen tic from these ancient writers, all of whom were foreigners who were ignorant of the language in which the sacred books of the Persians are written. It is to the scholars of modern Europe that all our reliable knowledge on this difficult subject is due; and the fol lowing is a brief sketch of their labours. Hyde, the celebrated Oxford scholar, published in 1700 his Eistoria religionis Persarum Atagovum, 1 His sources of information were from Grecian, Koman, Persian, and Arabian writers; but he was unable to read the original texts of the Zend A vesta, though he possessed several manuscripts. After Hyde, in this field of research, followed the enthusiastic Anquetil du Perron, whose romantic voyage to India in search of the Zend Avesta is so well known. 1 Second edition, 1760, 580 pages. The Saddar, his authority, is quite modern, only written two centuries before Hyde s own time. Mr. James Eraser, factor at Surat, collected MSS., now at Oxford. Author of Life of Nadir Shah. 1720, Mr. George Bowcher, merchant at Surat, sent home a copy of the Vendidad-Sade.THE ZEND AVESTA. 45 Having resolved to procure manuscripts of all the sacred books of Zoroaster in Western India, he entered him self as a sailor on board a ship of the French East India Company bound for Bombay, in 1754. Arriving at Surat, he bribed one of the most learned Dustiirs (Parsee priests) to procure him manuscripts, and teach him the language. In 1759, he set about making a French translation of the Zend Avesta; and in 1761 he sailed for Europe, having purchased many manuscript copies of the sacred books of the Parsees. These he compared with manuscripts in England, and he finally deposited the whole of his collection in the library at Paris, where they still remain. In 1771, he published his Zend Avesta, the work of Zoroaster, translated into French, 2 vols. 4to. His work, though incorrect and inaccurate, nevertheless gives a notion of the whole of the Zoroastrian ideas. 1 But it was only in the easier parts that he could gain an approximate idea of their contents, and he was unable to distinguish cases, tenses, or moods. Yet his descriptions of rites and ceremonies are quite correct: he was trustworthy, wrote only what was taught him by the Parsee Dustiirs, and much is due to him as the founder of all researches subse quently made into the Zend Avesta. Erasmus Eask, a Danish scholar, followed in the footsteps of AnquetiL He went to Bombay to purchase Zend and Pehlvi manuscripts, and in 1830 deposited the most ancient known copies of two of the sacred 1 Jones, then a young man, wrote a pamphlet attacking Anquetil.

In 1826, he wrote a pamphlet' On the Age and Genuineness of the Zend Language. At about the same time Eugene Burnouf, Professor of Sanscrit in Paris, applied his knowledge of that lan guage to a discovery of the rudiments of Zend grammar and etymology. He discovered the incorrectness of Anquetil's translation, and published a lithographed copy of some of that scholar's manuscripts, being the first edition of Zend texts that ever appeared in Europe, 1829-33. Burnouf died in 1852. 3 In 1829, Justus Olshausen, at Hamburg, published an edition of the first four chapters of the Vendidad; and Francis Bopp endeavoured to give an outline of the Zend grammar, chiefly according to the results arrived at by Burnouf, in his Comparative Grammar. Frederic Spiegel, in 1850, was employed by the 1 Vendidad and Izeshne. 2 Dates 1186 and 1258 given for copies now lost. Text of Zend MSS., the same, only spelling varies.

Hermann Brockhaus of Leipsic, in the same year, published an edition of some of the sacred books ( Vendidad,Yasna, and Visparat) in Eoman characters. In 1841—43, a Danish scholar named Westergaard visited both India and Persia; and it is to him we owe the first complete edition of the Zend Avesta, published in 1852—4, with a dictionary and grammar. Martin Haug, Professor of Sanscrit in the Puna College, commenced the study of Zend in 1852. Being convinced, like Burnouf, that the language of the Vedas stands, among all Aryan dialects, nearest to the Zend, he studied the language of the Eig-Veda Sanhita also.

Collections of Songs and Zarathrustra, 2 vols. ; and in 1862, at Bombay, his Sacred Language, Writings, Thus, from Anquetil to Dr. Haug, the study of Zendic literature is barely a century old. We must now glance at the history of the Zend Lan guage, and at the channels through which the ancient Persian sacred books iu that language passed down into the hands of the modern Parsees. Dr. Haug divides the ancient language of Iran into the Bactrian and Median branches. The Bactrian branch is that in which the scanty fragments of the sacred Persian scriptures are written. It was dying out between B.C. 300 and 200. In the Median branch a few documents are extant in the cuneiform inscriptions48 history of persia. at Persepolis and Behistun. It is closely allied to the Bactrian of the Zend Avesta, but shows some peculiari ties. This language was undoubtedly the mother of modern Persian, though the differences between them are great. The ancient tongue had many inflexions, like Zend and Sanscrit, in nouns, verbs, and genders, while the modern Persian has lost nearly all. In the time of the Sassanian dynasty we learn from the inscriptions and coins that the language, as regards the want of inflexions, was much in the same state as it is now. The Sassanian coins ( a.d . 235-640) also show many Semitic words with Aryan termina tions. Soon after the Moslem conquest many Arabic words were incorporated into the Persian tongue. In the Sassanian age there was also a mixture of Persian with Chaldee, which was called Pehlvi, extending from a.d . 200 to 700; Pazend from 700 to 1100; and modern Persian from 1100 to the present time. The ancient Zend is rich in inflexions in the verbs and nouns, and is a genuine sister of Sanscrit, Greek, Latin, and Gothic. But in the present texts of the Zend Avesta there are grammatical defects, the unin- flected state of words being used instead of their original inflected state. Dr. Hang attributes this to the want of grammatical studies among the ancient Persians as a separate science, as was the case with Sanscrit among the Brahmans. Thus the Zend gram mar was never fixed in any way by rules, and cor ruptions and abbreviations gradually crept in. With the Brahmans, on the other hand, grammar was aTHE ZEND AVESTA. 49 separate branch of study, and to this we owe the wonderfully correct and accurate grammatical state of the text of the Vedas. The Persian dynasty, which upheld the Zoroastrian creed, fell when Alexander overran Asia. During the reigns of the Parthian Arsacidse, B .c. 335 to a.d. 235, most of the sacred writings were lost, but their successors, the Persian Sassanida3, in their endeavours to revive the faith, searched after all the fragments which were still extant, and to this we owe that part of the Zend Avesta which has reached our time. 1 After the Muhammadan conquest, the Parsees fled to Western India with the fragments of their scriptures, which had thus been recovered by the Sassanian kings; and that thriving band of exiles, in Surat, Piina, Bombay, &amp;c., has carefully preserved the sacred wri tings of their Zoroastrian ancestors to our time. We now come to a consideration of the antiquity of the ancient Persian scriptures. Looking at the mass of writings which compose them, and the time it would take for the accumulation of so extensive a literature. Dr. Haug is of opinion that the earliest fragments extant, the Gathas, cannot be placed later than 1500 B.C.; while the whole body of writings forming the Zend Avesta may have been collected together at about 500 b.c. Dr. Haug says' The extensive ancient literature contained in the Nosks was already complete in 400 b.c. 1 Zend Avesta: Avesta being the original sacred text, and the commentary. Pazend denotes the further explanation of the Zend doctrine. eSetudar . 2. Setudgar HISTOEY OF PEESIA. It was, of course, the work of centuries, and its beginning may be placed at 1500 B.C. ; for, at least, a thousand years must have elapsed before such a various and bulky sacred literature could grow up out of the seeds sown by the great founder of the Persian creed, Zarathrustra Spitama.' We have the names of all the books, with short summaries of their contents. The whole scripture consisted of twenty-one parts, called Nosks, each con taining Avesta and Zend, that is, an original text, and a commentary on it; viz.— 3. Vahista-mathra 4. Bagha . . . 5.

The most ancient and sacred fragment of all, called Yasna or Izeshne, is not contained in any of the Nosks, but many verses are quoted from it in the Vendidad, as most sacred and scriptural.

The authorship of the whole Zend Avesta was ascribed to Zoroaster, as one man, by the ancient Greeks and the modern Parsees. This is manifestly impossible ; but if we take the name Zarathrustra, not as that of an individual, but as the spiritual head of the ancient Persians generally, the difficulty ceases, and the founder is distinguished by the name A-t the head of Zend literature are undoubtedly the five Gathas, which, there is reason to think, were the work of Zarathrustra Spitama himself, and his immediate disciples, 1 who preached to their country men a new and more pure religion, exhorting them to leave idolatry, and to worship the living God only. It is to the Gathas, therefore, which occupy the same sort of position as regards the Nosks as the Eig Veda does as regards the Brahmanas and later Vedas, that our attention must chiefly be directed in this enquiry. From the Gathas, and the later sacred writings, which contain more or less of the sayings and doctrine of the founder of the ancient Persian religion, we 1 The names of his disciples, who are mentioned, are— tama.

Frashoastra,THE ZEND AVESTA. 53 gather all that can ever be known of those remote ages ; and it has thus been discovered, almost beyond a doubt, that Zarathrustra Spitama was a reformer of the elemental rehgion of the Eig Veda, and that he caused a separation between two great branches of the Aryan stock. The Vedic and Zarathrustrian Aryans, it must always be remembered, were once the same people : Zend and Sanscrit are but dialects of one language.^ That the ancient Persian rehgion was originally a protest against the coarse worship of the Eig Veda is made evident in several ways. In the Vedas, the name for divine beings is D; in the Zend Avesta the same word is the general name for evil spirits {Div). Ahura is the first part of (Ormuzd) in the Zend Avesta, while in the later Vedas and the Puranas the Asuras are evil spirits.® But, with regard to this latter word, it is still more remark able that in the Eig Veda the Asuras are not evil but good spirits; and that it was not until later times, after the reformer had adopted the word to express the Deity, that it was used in an evil sense by the Eishis of the Vedas. Several of the Vedic gods are actually to be found in the Zend Avesta, some as devils, others 1 The Mantras of the Vedas are the same as the Manthras of the Zend Avesta.

Mithra is a Persian angel; the Vedic form of the word being Mitra. Arya- man, a Vedic deity, is Ahriman, the evil genius of the Persians; and there are several other instances of the same nature. The reformation of the great Zarathrustra Spitama must, therefore, be placed after the composition of most of the hymns of the Rig Veda. But that event took place before the Yajur Veda was composed, and we thus narrow its epoch between two periods, which, however, are themselves uncertain. That Zarathrustra flourished before the Yajur Veda period, appears from the following consideration : Among the metres used in the Yajur Veda seven are marked by the epithet asuri. These asuri metres, which are strange to the whole Eig Veda, are, actually found in the Gathas ot the Zend Avesta, which professedly exhibits the doc trine of the Ahura religion. This shows clearly that the old Gatha literature of the Zend Avesta was perfectly wellknown to the Eishis who compiled the Yajur Veda. 1 The reformer must have appeared before the two great Aryan peoples of India and Persia separated, and when they were still living as one people, otherwise it is impossible to account for the identity of language, and of the names of deities and spirits, good and evil. If it be true that Zarathrustra flourished 1500 B.C., the earliest Eig Veda hymns must date at least as far back as 2000 B.C. 2 1 Haug, p. 229. 2 Berosus, as preserved by Eusebius, mentions a Median dynasty : AMTHE ZEND AVESTA. 55 Thus, in the remotest ages, we find the earliest people of whom any traces have reached us, invoking the spirits of the sun, the wind, the air, the dawn, with simple hymns of prayer and praise on the Bactrian mountains. Some few of the loftiest intellects, the most thoughtful of the Kishis, had conceived and even expressed an idea of a great First Cause; but it was not until the appearance of Zarathrustra Spitama that this sublime doctrine was openly and earnestly preached to the people. It evidently encountered violent oppo sition, and may have been the moving cause of the separation of two of the Aryan families, one pouring down into India, the other spreading itself over Media and Persia. Of the opposition and antagonism of the Vedic Eishis against the Bactrian reformer there is good evidence. The Vedic religion is a belief in and worship of the Divas, the Persian of the Ahuras. In the earliest Vedic hymns the word is used in a perfectly good sense, and there must once have been a vital struggle between the professors of the and those of the Ahura religion, in consequence of which the originally good meaning of was sub sequently changed to a bad one in the Vedas. The struggle and separation must have taken place soon after the Vedic Aryans immigrated into India, 1 and when the majority of the Eig Veda hymns were of Babylon beginning with a King Zoroaster, long before Ninus; his date would be 2234 B.C.— Max Muller, p. 209 (note), 1 Max Miiller says that the Zoroastrians were a colony from Northern India; that they had been together for a time with the Vedic Aryans, and that, a schism taking place, the Zoroastrians migrated westward to Persia.56 HISTORY OF PERSIA. already composed. Zaratlimstra's attacks were directed against the Soma (Homa) sacrifices, as well as against the blind worship of the elements. The Grathas, five in number, are a collection of metrical pieces, containing prayers and hymns, together with abstract thoughts on metaphysical subjects. The metres are of the same nature as those of the Vedic hymns. 1 In the Gathas we have the real sayings and teach ings of Zoroaster himself, mixed probably with those of his disciples, Jamaspa, Vistaspa, and Frashoastra. The great founder of this religion inculcated his teaching by means of allegory. Thus, in the first Gatha, 2 Geus- urva, the soul of the animated creation, is made to implore the assistance of the archangels, on account of attempts on his life. Mazda replied to Ardibehesht, the angel who had been appointed to protect this soul of the earth, that Geus-urva was being cut to pieces for the benefit of the agriculturist, and Zoroaster was then endowed with eloquence to bring this message to the world. Geus-urva (literally ' soul of the cow') is the earth, here compared to a cow. By the cutting to pieces ploughing is to be understood, and the sense of this decree is that the soil is to be tilled. Zoroaster here acts as the prophet of agriculture. In the third section of the first Gatha, Zoroaster, standing before the sacred fire, makes a speech to a 1 Gatha means a song, from the root gai, to sing.' They are in a more ancient dialect than the rest of the Zend Avesta. 2 1. Gatha Ahunavaiti (7 chapters, 101 verses of 48 syllables).THE ZEND AVESTA. 57 meeting of his countrymen, calling upon them to for sake the worship of Devas (the Vedic gods), and to bow only before Ahuramazdao We can almost fancy to ourselves the scene which was thus enacted in those far-off days. The imposing form of the prophet standing erect beside the sacred flame, and proclaiming to the people the worship of one God. A momentous occasion—the first explicit declaration of a belief in one Almighty Creative Power was then made; the great truth spread, with electric speed, through the dense crowd of listeners, and the remotest ages have been affected by the grand speech of that father of poets and philosophers, when he so solemnly called upon the people to worship one God, and to choose that day between good and evil. ' I will now tell you, who are assembled here,' he began, ' the wise sayings of the most wise ; I will recite the praises of the living God, and the songs of the Good Spirit, the sublime truth which I see arising out of those sacred flames. ' Every one, both men and women, ought to-day to choose his creed. Ye offspring of renowned ancestors, awake to agree with us! ' In the beginning there was a pair of twins, two spirits, each of a peculiar activity; these are the good and the base in thought, word, and deed. Choose one of these two spirits. Be good, not base. You cannot belong to both, therefore perform ye the command ments which, pronounced by the wise God himself, have been given to mankind.' In the fourth section of the first Gatha, the Urvdtas,58 HISTORY OP PEESIA. or sayings of Ahuramazdao, are revealed to Zoroaster, and it is here declared that the chief means of check ing evil influences is the cultivation of the soil. In the fifth section idolatry and its evil consequences are depicted. Addressing the gods of the Vedas, the re former exclaims, ' Ye Devas have sprung out of the evil spirit, who takes possession of you by intoxication (Soma juice), teaching you manifold arts to deceive and destroy mankind, for which you are notorious everywhere.' In the first section of the second Gatha 1 the mission of Zoroaster is announced, in the second he receives instructions respecting the highest matters of human speculation, and in the third he appears before a large assembly to propound his new doctrine. In the second section the prophet seeks knowledge from the Almighty. ' I will ask thee, tell it right, thou living God! How arose the present life ? By what means are the present things to be supported? Who made the sun and stars ? Who causes the moon to increase and wane, if not Thou ? Who made the water and trees of the field ? Who is in the winds and storms that they so quickly run? Who is the Creator of the good-minded beings ? Thou wise! 'I will ask thee, tell it right, thou living God! Who made the lights of good effect, and darkness? Who made morning, noon, and night, always remind ing the priest of his duties ? ' In the third section Zoroaster propounds his doc- 1 2. GathaTHE ZEND AVESTA. 59 trine. ' I will tell you of the two primeval spirits of life.' His leading idea is Monotheism, while his specu lative philosophy admits of Dualism, or the supposition of two primeval causes of the real and the intellectual world. His predecessors worshipped a plurality of gods, Devas and Asuras {Ah but he reduced the plurality to a unity, and called God the Ahura, or Spirit, which is called that is, ' wise.' His notion of Ahura-m as the Supreme Being, is identical with that of Elohim or Jehovah. A separate evil spirit is entirely strange to Zoroaster's theology, though the opinion appears in later books, such as the Vendidad. In the Gathas, however, two primeval causes are supposed. The one, who produced reality and truth, is called Vohu-mand (' good mind'), the other, through whom came unreality and falsehood, Aken-mano (' nought mind'). They are said to be twins, and are spread everywhere. In the Gathas, also, two intellects or lives are spoken of, and this seems to allude to the idea of body and soul. Immortality is also clearly expressed, and a future state of pleasure and pain. Heaven is Gorotmon ('House of Hymns') and Vashista. 1 1 Modern Persian Behesht, from which word Paradise is borrowed, in the New Testament. Luke xxiii. 43; 2 Cor. xii. 4; Rev. ii. 7. It is literally a park or garden. In the Septuagint it is used for the garden of Eden. In the New Testament the word appears to be used for the abode of the departed spirits of the good, between death and the resurrection; except in Revelations ii. 7, where it seems to mean either the garden of Eden, or Heaven itself, if the passage be taken figuratively. See also Song of Solomon, iv. 13; Eccles. ii. 5 ; Nehemiah ii. 8., where in our version {Paredais) is rendered 1 orchard/ and, in Nehemiah, 1 forest.*f f 60 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Hell is Brujo -demana (' the House of Destruction') and Duzak, and between tlie two stands Chinvat-Peretu, ' the bridge of the judge.' The resurrection of the body is a genuine Zoroastrian dogma, and there is not the slightest trace of its having been borrowed from a foreign source. 1 The three last Gathas are collections of ancient songs, and are much shorter than the two first. 2 All five are included in the Yasna or Izeshne. Another important feature in the theology of Zo roaster was the existence of archangels or attributes of God; thus Bahman was the vital faculty in all living beings of the good creation, was the genius of living flame, light, brightness, and splendour, Shahravar of metals and wealth, of the earth, Khordad and Amerdad of vegetation; Serosh was the angel who stands between God and man—the great teacher. The first six of these were the six Amshaspands or archangels. Zoroaster and his dis ciples inculcated their lessons by imaginary conver sations with these archangels, who were thus made to preach the principles of industry, virtue, and the doc trine of future rewards and punishments. Of all the virtues brotherly love is esteemed the most, and women received an equal place with men. We must here pause awhile, for the above is all that can be gleaned, from the earliest sacred books, of the 1 Haug, p. 267. ^ 3. Gatha Spenta Mainyusys, 4. Gatha Vohu Khshathrem* 5. Gatha Vahistoistis*THE ZEND AVESTA. 61 teaching of Zoroaster himself. The later scriptures may contain more or less of his sayings, but they were written long after his death, when many corruptions had crept in to mar the beauty of his purer creeds The five Gathas alone contain the writings of the great reformer himself. The result of our enquiry so far is that, after the ancient Aryan stock of Central Asia had for centuries contented themselves with a system of worship of the elements by hymns of prayer and praise, a few of the most thoughtful of the Kishis began to conceive an idea of a Supreme Being, above and beyond the visible world; that, in process of time, a great and command ing mind arose amongst these Aryan Eishis in the person of Zoroaster, denouncing the Vedic worship, and preaching the doctrine of Monotheism to the people; that there was a schism between the Vedic people and the followers of the reformer, and that the latter separated from the Hindu-Aryan stock, and formed the Persian nation, while the former became the ancestors of Brahmanic Hindus. Finally, we find that the religion of the reformer, as contained in the five Gathas, consisted of a belief in one all-wise Spirit, the Creator and Preserver, of a future state of rewards and punishments, of the resurrection of the body, 1 of 1 Yet Dr. Whately suggests the following questions as all suffi cient proofs of the Divine origin of the Jewish religion, because they are unanswerable ! 1 How it happens that our sacred books ascribes the creation of the world immediately to the Supreme Being? How came one semi-barbarous people to reach the idea that their God was Creator and Lord of the whole world, an idea that no other nation of anti-62 HISTORY OF PEESIA. the existence of two antagonistic principles, of good and evil, of tlie duty of man to adhere to one and resist the other, and of the inculcation of industry, especially in agriculture, of truth, of purity, and of justice. After the death of the first Zoroaster he was followed by a succession of priests, who continued to add to the works left by him during the following thousand years; until at last, in the days of Gushtasp or Darius, the great mass of Persian sacred literature was collected together in the Zend Avesta. In this long period much was added which is opposed to the pristine teaching of the reformer himself ? an actual evil spirit appears who finds no place in the doctrine of the Gathas, and a minute and complicated system of wor ship was gradually elaborated, as the people grew in wealth and civilisation. Of the relics of the Zend Avesta which have come down to our time, the greater portion consists of these more modern productions. After the Yasna (Izeshne), which contains the Gathas, follows the Visparad, a collection of prayers referring to the preparation of sacred water, and the consecration of offerings. Next comes the Vendidad, or code of religious, civil, and criminal laws, in twenty- two chapters, called Fargards which is probably the quity ever reached? How it happens that the Christian promise of eternal life, through the resurrection of the body at the last day, is so different from any promise of eternal life that was ever made by man. These are peculiarities which no other religion but Christianity, and those which directly borrowed from Christi anity, possess.'—Whately's Cautions for the Times, p. 507-9.THE ZEND AVESTA, joint work of many high priests during a period of several centuries. Some of the sayings may be from Zoroaster himself ; but the descriptions of ceremonies and observances are too minute to allow of a very early date being assigned to the whole. In the first three Fargards there is a very interest ing enumeration of the sixteen Aryan countries over which the religion of Zoroaster then extended, 1 some legends of King Jamshid, and the praise of agricul ture as the most meritorious work. The fourth Far- gard contains the moral code; and it is remarkable that the intention to commit a crime is here stigmatised as being equal in guilt to the actual commission : ' When a man rises to murder, that is, attempt at murder; when he seizes with an evil intention, that is, the consummation of murder.' 2 The remaining Far gards relate to ceremonies and observances, the treat ment of dead bodies, purifications, and the construc tion of Dokhmas, or ' towers of silence.' The Yashts 3 are prayers addressed to one Divine Being, or to a certain class of Divine Beings, as the Amshaspands or archangels. They were collected and published for the first time in Westergaard's edition. In the prayer to Ormuzd, the twenty names of the Supreme Being are enumerated; and amongst them we 1 The Vendidad list has been critically examined by Sir Henry Eawlinson.—See Royal Geographical Society's Journal, vol. xlii. p. 500. 2 See Matt. v. 21, 22. 3 Teshti means worship by prayers and sacrifices.64 HISTORY OF PERSIA. find Ahmi (' I am'), Ahura (' living'), and Ahvii ('I am that I am'). 1 There is also a prayer to tlie Haftan, or seven Spirits (Ormnzd and the six Arch angels), to Ardibehesht, to Khordad, and to ArdviSura Anahita, the mighty goddess. The Afrigans are v short blessings recited before meals. The Nyayish, or hymns of praise, are five iu number, to the sun ^Khuvshcd^,to the angel of the sun (Mithra), to the moon (Mdh), to water (Abdn), and to fire. The two first must be said thrice a day by every Parsee, the third once a month; and the Gahs are short prayers. Such are the fragments which have reached us, of that great mass of Persian sacred literature which was formerly contained in the Zend Avesta. For many centuries the pure religion of Zoroaster prevailed, or held its own against Buddhism and Magism ; and in the Behistun Inscriptions, which were carved, on the rock near Hamadan, by order of Darius, probably a thousand years after the death of the great reformer, there is still no sign of any worship of the elements, but only a worship of one Supreme Being, with occasional mention of an evil spirit. 2 But the religion described by Herodotus is elemental, the Magi worshipped Mithra and Homa (Sun and Moon), and thus a more corrupt belief appears to have existed in ancient Persia, by the side of the elevated ritual of 1 Compare Ex. iii. 14: njnts (Ehyeh asher I am that I am,' or 'I will be that I will be.') 2 Eawlinson's Herodotus.THE ZEND AVESTA. 65 the followers of Zoroaster. The upholders of Zoro aster's creed appear even to have been in a minority at one time. Buddhism was embraced by king Lohrasp at Balkh, while the elemental religion of the masses made head against the pure worship of the advanced thinkers. Hence the unsuccessful attempt of the Magi on the death of Cambyses, a full account of which is given on the Behistiin Inscriptions, as well as in the pages of Herodotus. This antagonism in ancient Persia, between the elemental worship of the Magi, a worship resembling that of the Vedas, and the pure religion of Zoroaster, explains many points which would otherwise be obscure in this portion of ancient history. The errors which had thus either crept into the Persian religion, or were allowed to exist side by side with it, are possibly referred to in the Book of Isaiah, where Cyrus is emphatically reminded of the doctrine of the Gathas. 1 It was not until after the canon of the Zend Avesta was complete, that the ancient Persians, the Aryan monotheists, came in contact with the Jewish people, the Semitic monotheists, during the captivity of the latter in Babylon, but before the Persian conquest of Babylon, for Jeremiah mentions the chief of the Magi 1 See also note, p. 56. * I am the Lord, and tliere is none else, there is no God beside Me: I girded thee, though thou has not known Me : that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside Me. I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness ; 1 make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.' Isaiah xlv.66 HISTORY OF PERSIA. (^-rn), 1 in the retinue of iNebucliadnezzar, B.C. 600. Ezekielalso appears to allude to the religion of Persia; 2 and Isaiah speaks of Cyrus (^3 Koresh) as the anointed of the Lord, the shepherd who executes the Lord's decrees, the man appointed by the Lord's counsel, strengthened by the Lord to subdue the heathen. 3 The Jewish people were thus for a long time in very close contact with the Zoroastrians, after the canon of the sacred writings of the latter was closed. Here then are the three ancient nations, whose sacred books have reached us: the Vedic Aryans, the Zoro astrians, and the Jews ; the two former Aryan, and the latter Semitic. The last two, the Zoroastrians and the Jews, were monotheists. The Zoroastrians believed in one Su preme God—Ahura-mazdao; in a future state of rewards and punishments, and in the resurrection of the body. The Jews, down to the period of the Cap tivity, held no doctrine of a future state. Bishop Warburton endeavoured to prove the Divine legation of Moses by the absence of this doctrine, 4 and Dr. Whately adopts the same line of argument; 5 so that the fact is admitted on high authority. After their return to their own land, having sojourned for half a century amongst Zoroastrians, one sect, at least, of the 1 Jer. xxxix. 3. 2 Ezek. viii. 16. 5 Isaiah xlv. 1. Isaiah xliv. 28.

The Persian word for Heaven, Paradise, was also adopted by the Jews, and appears in the New Testament. 1 These indications of a contact between the two monotheisms of the Aryan and of the Semitic races are deeply interesting; for, by this means, it is possible that the influence of that most ancient of seers and prophets, the mighty Zarathrustra Spitama, may be felt even in the present age. There is evidence, which has been discussed by Sir Henry Eawlinson in his monograph on the Oxus, that Buddhism prevailed in the valley of the Oxus at a very early period, superseding the Zoroastrian religion ; and that the Kaianian kings, immediately preceding Gush- tasp, were Buddhists. In that king's reign, the re former arose, who made a stand both against the Magians and Buddhists, and carried the king with him; restoring the ancient creed of Zarathrustra Spitama. Sir Henry speaks of the valley of the Oxus as having been the battle-field between Buddhism and Zoroastrianism for a thousand years. 2 1 See also note at p. 56. The Book of Enoch, so full of allusions to a future state, to angels, and to other Zoroastrian ideas, was pro bably written by a Jew who had had much intercourse with learned Persians. 2 Dualism and Sabceanism. 1 The truth seems to be that the Aryans, who overran Asia from the Hindu Kiish to the Persian Gulf, were but a small element in the population of the countries subdued by them ; and thus, though at first they imposed their religion, which was Dualism, very soon a reaction took place. The religion of the masses made head against68 HISTORY OF PEESIA. the invading worship. The Magi grew in power. Taking advan tage of the long absence of Cambyses in Egypt, Gomates seized the throne, the Magi perhaps designing a transference of power from the warrior to the priest caste. ' When it was found that Gomates was not Smerdis, the nobles rose, Darius by right of birth took the lead; Gomates was killed, and a massacre of the Magi followed. Dualism was restored, and the annual festival of the Magophonia instituted. ' In the Behistun Inscription, Darius fully describes this revolu tion. Hence Darius enjoys the reputation of being a great religious reformer, and hence he is said to have been contemporary with Zoroaster. 4 The later Persian religion, after Magism had corrupted it, was still regarded as the system established by Darius. Hence the introduction of Gushtasp into the Zend Avesta; and hence Darius was supposed to have reformed and purified the religion of the people, under the inspired advice of Zoroaster.'—Rawlinson's Herodotus,69 CHAPTER IV. SASSANIAN DYNASTY. T owards the end of the second century of the Chris tian era, one Sassan 1 was chief of the hamlets of Khir, 70 miles south-east of Persepolis, and was in charge of the fire temples. His son Babek, on the mother's side, was descended from the Kaianian kings, and his grandson Ardeshir grew up with lofty ideas of his kingly birthright. Young Ardeshir, in very early youth, was entrusted to the care of the local ruler of Darabjird, whom he succeeded in his government. This town is situated in an extensive plain, interspersed with villages and cultivated land. A small river flows past it, which is surrounded by groves of orange and lemon trees, yielding such an abundance of fruit, that it is exported to every part of Persia. But Ardeshir could never rest satisfied with a sub ordinate post; and, full of a patriotic ambition to restore the religion and government of Persia, he 1 From Sassa7i, the dynasty was called Sassanian.70 HISTORY OF PERSIA. collected an army and conquered Pars, Kirman, and 'Mk. At this time the Parthian sovereign of Persia was a weak prince, named Arduan, called by the Pomans Artabanus, a descendant of Arsaces. While Ardeshir made these rapid conquests, he remained in the mountainous districts around Hamadan and Kirman- sMh; but at length he resolved to hazard all on a pitched battle. The armies met on a plain called Pam Hormazd, about thirty miles from the sea, and near the modern city of Shuster. After a desperate battle Arduan was killed, and Ardeshir was hailed on the field as Malhln Malkd, or ' King of Kings,' a title ever since borne by the sovereigns of Persia. 1 The whole empire, as well as part of Turan, acknowledged the sway of this descendant of the Kaianian kings, the hallowed apron of Kaf became the national standard, the religion of Zoroaster was restored throughout the empire, and a native sovereign once more ruled in Persia. His style, as appears from the coins, was ' the Ormazd Worshipper, divine Ardeshir, King of Kings of IrUn, of divine origin from God.' Ardeshir fixed his capital at a place called Madayn, or Ctesiphon, on the banks of the Tigris. The Par thian kings had formerly established a camp at Ctesi phon, to watch the Greek city of Seleucia, built by Seleucus Nicator, on the opposite side of the river; but during the reign of Ardeshir, Ctesiphon was trans formed from a camp into a rich and populous city. 2 1 A.D. 226. 2 Eighteen miles sontli of Baghdad.SASSANIAN DYNASTY. 71 It was admirably situated on a sort of peninsula, so that the Tigris embraced the greater part of the town. 1 In the year 240 A.D., Ardeshir, after a long and glorious reign, resigned the crown to his son Shapur. He had effected a wonderful revolution in the con dition of his country; and, after groaning under the foreign domination of Greeks and Parthians for five centuries, he had the glory of restoring it to its pristine power and splendour. Two of his favourite sayings were : c There can be no power without an army, no army without money, no money without agriculture, and no agriculture without justice.' And 6 When a king is just, his subjects must love him, but the worst of all monarchs is he, whom the wealthy, and not the wicked, dread.' His dying speech to his son has also been preserved by the pious care of Ferdausy. 2 Ardeshir's last words were : ' Never forget, my son, that as a King, you are at once the Protector of Eeligion and of your Country. Consider the altar and throne as inseparable ; they must always sustain each other. A sovereign without religion is a tyrant, and a people who have none may be deemed the most monstrous of all societies ; for it is by holy laws that a political association can alone be bound. May your administration be such as to 1 Kinneir's Memoir. 2 Malcolm says that Ferdausy is undoubtedly correct in his account of this speech, as he copied it from ancient Pehlvi manuscripts.72 histohy of persia. bring, at a future day, the blessings of those whom God confided to your fraternal care, upon both your memory and mine !' Shapiir I. had a glorious war with the Eomans, and took their Emperor Valerian prisoner, in 260 a.d. This victory is commemorated on rock sculptures at SHAFUR I. Naksh-i-Eejab. The Koman writers accuse Shapiir of treating his prisoner with cruelty, and it is certain that Valerian died in captivity; but the sculptures give no indication of any indignity to the captive, and Persian writers say that Valerian was employed in the con struction of the celebrated irrigating dam near Shuster. These wars with the Eomans, though glorious to theSASSAKfAN DYNASTY. Persian arms, are not so interesting as the internal government of the Sassahian kings. Yet Shapiir's campaigns to the westward certainly had a direct effect on the language, and probably on the civilisa tion of the Persians. Indeed Mr. Thomas's suggested translation of the Hajiabad Inscription indicates the conversion to Christianity of the Persian King, pro bably by the Heresiarch Manes, who, however, fled from Persia, and returned after the accession of Shapur's son, Hormazd. Shapur is said only to have desired wealth, that he might use it for good and great purposes ; and he constructed many useful public works, and founded several cities. The chief of these was Kishupur, 1 a town in Klm- raslin, which is prettily situated amidst gardens and villages grouped near to one another. In the time of Shapur, the plain in which NisMpur is situated was irri gated by 12,000 water-courses, but at the present day most of them are dry ; nevertheless, there is amazing fertility, and the climate is delicious. To the north are high mountains almost encircling the plain, and many villages lie in the gorges and on the slopes. Near -Mishapur there are the most famous torquoise mines in the world. 2 Shapur made his son Hormazd Governor of Khu- rMn, with Mshapur as his capital; and the young prince distinguished himself by repelling the invasions Ni, reeds, and Shapur, from the reeds growing round it, ac cording to some writers. But others say that the word is Nishabftr, and that it has no special meaning. See i eirier s C(xv(ivan Journeys \ Kinneir's Memoir 5 Heeren's Researches.74 HISTORY OF PERSIA. of the hordes of Turan. Envious persons at court, however, excited, suspicions of his son s fidelity in the breast of Shapur ; and on hearing of his danger, Hor- mazd caused one of his hands to he cut off, and sent it to his father, desiring him to accept that unques tionable mark of his devotion. Shapur, struck with horror, ever afterwards treated his son with perfect confidence, and in a.d . 271, Hormazd succeeded his father. 1 Hormazd founded a city near Shuster, in the romantic valley of Eam-Hormazd, 2 where the people still show an orange-tree, which he is believed to have planted. Varahran I, a mild and munificent prince, succeeded his father Hormazd, and ruled his subjects with justice and moderation. 3 He executed the famous Manes, founder of the Manichasan heresy. 4 He was followed by his son, Varahran II., in whose reign the Eoman Emperor Carus carried his arms across the Tigris,' and for a short time occupied Ctesiphon. 5 His son Varahran III. was succeeded, after four months, by his brother Nersehi. Nersehi waged a long war with the Roman Emperor Galerius; and was eventually forced to cede Azerbaijan to Teridates, king of Armenia, the ally of Eome; who was descended from Arsaces the founder of the Parthian dynasty, Teridates fixed his capital at Tabriz, which he enlarged and improved. 1 Hormisdas of the Greeks. &lt;2 Bam means 4 rest,' i the rest of Hormazd. 7 Ram in Pehlvi is the same as Aram in modern Persian.

The Moheds, or priests, however, declared that the queen's child would be a boy, and he was crowned before he was born by the loyal nobles of Persia. The baby king succeeded as Shapur II. 2 During his long minority the Arabs of el-Bahrain invaded the southern coasts of Persia ; the tribes from Turan over ran Khurasan ; and the Greeks crossed the Tigris. On coming of age, Shapur first chastised the Arabs, and dislocated the shoulders of all he captured, as a punish ment for their cruelties to the unprotected villagers on the shores of the Persian Gulf. Hence he is always known as Zu'laktaf, or 'Lord of the Shoulders.' He also waged a successful war with the Eoman Emperor Constantius, and afterwards obliged the Emperor Julian to retreat with disgrace from Mesopotamia.' Shapur raised the Persian empire to a state of great prosperity. He defeated all his enemies, captured the strong Eoman fortress of JSTisibis between the Tigris and Euphrates, conquered Armenia, and extended his dominions in every direction. His favourite saying was; ' Words may prove more vivifying than the showers of spring, and sharper than the sword of destruction. The point of a lance may be withdrawn from the body, but a cruel expression can never be extracted from the heart it has once wounded.' In 380, Shapur was succeeded by his son Ardeshir II., 1 a.d . 301 to 309. 2 a.d . 309.70 history of persia. wlio in 384 was deposed by his brother Shapur III.; and the latter king having been killed by the fall of a tent, in a violent gust of wind, his brother Varahran IV. succeeded him in a.d . 386. 1 Varahran was surnamed Kinnanshdh, from having previously been governor of the province of Kirman; and he perpetuated the name by building a city called varahran iv. after him, Kirmanshah, which is still a large and popu lous place. 2 Numbers of gardens line the gorge that lies west of the city, and thousands of sheep are reared in the ne ; gh- 1 The ancestor of the Rajput Eajahs of Johdpiir, named Basdes, married his daughter to Yarahran IV., in a.d . 390. 2 Great quantities of beautiful Persian carpets are now made in Kirmanshah and its neighbourhood.

On the north, the plain of Kirmanshah is bounded by a lofty range of moun tains, on the sides of which the famous excavations and sculptures of Tdki-Hostdn were cut by order of King Varahran IV. 1 They were intended to commemorate his own reign and that of his father, the great Shapur II. In one place there is an arch cut in the rock, sixty feet high, twenty deep, and twenty-four broad. Over the centre there is a crescent, and on each side of it an angel with a diadem in one hand and a cup in the other. In the centre of the arch there is a man in armour, with a shield, lance, quiver, and bow; and a crown on his head. Near this cave, there are two sculptures beauti fully executed, one of a boar hunt, and another of a stag hunt. 2 There is, also, another cave of the same shape, with a bas relief of two kings (Shapur and Varahran) holding a ring and standing on a prostrate Eoman soldier. Zoioaster is standing by their side, his head covered with rays of glory. These magnificent remains may still be seen in the face of the mountain, to attest the former greatness of the Sassanian kings. The favourite residence of Varahran IV., was the little town of Khonsar, 3 between Hamadan and Isfahan, whither he was wont to retire in his intervals of rest from the cares of state. In approaching Khonsar from 1 About six miles from Kidman shah. 2 Kenneir's Memoir, Flandin et Coste. 3 One hundred and fifty miles from Hamadan, and ninety-two from Isfahan.78 HISTOEY OF PEESIA. the west, the road is completely shaded on both sides, for a distance of four or five miles, by every species of fruit-tree which the country produces. Khonsar itself is in a very narrow valley, with gardens to each house; and dark frowning rocks hang close over the luxuriant foliage of the fruit orchards. Varahran IV. was succeeded by his son Yezdegird I., 1 surnamed by the mobeds of Iran, TJIcithwi, or ' the Sin ner '; probably on account of his enlightened toleration of other religions. After a reign of sixteen years he was killed by a kick from a horse. Though abused by the Persian authors, and called he is univer sally praised by all the Greek and Eoman writers, as a wise and intelligent prince. Two of his favourite sayings were: ' The most wise monarch is he who never punished when in a rage; and who followed the first impulse of his mind, to reward the deserving.' And ' The thought of eternity cannot for a moment be absent from the mind without its verging towards sin.' Yezdegird had intrusted his son Varahran to the care of Noman, the chief of all the Arab tribes under the proteetion of the Persian government. The young prince passed his earlier years in the wild life of the desert, and became so devoted to the chase that he was surnamed Gor, or ' the wild ass,' from his fondness for hunting that swift and strong animal. The luxurious nobles of Ctesiphon opposed his acces- 1 a.d . 397..SASSANIAN DYNASTY. 79 sion, fearing the wild character of this child of the desert, but their resistance never became formidable. 1 The first act of King Varahran V. was to reward his tutor Noman, the second was to pardon all those who had opposed him. His valour, his munificence, and his virtue are the theme of every historian; and his generosity was so great that his ministers were forced to entreat him to reserve part of the revenue for his own use. 2 Soon after his accession, the chiefs of Tirnm crossed the Oxus, and overran KhurIMn with 20,000 men. King Varahran, who had been expected to march against them, disappeared ; dismay and universal terror spread through Persia, and the army of Tfiran in dulged in unguarded confidence. One night, however, they were suddenly attacked by the lost Varahran at the head of 7,000 of the best and bravest warriors of Iran, and the invaders were entirely defeated, and driven across the Oxus. Varahran also waged a suc cessful war with the Eoman Emperor Theodosius. Varahran Gor was one of the best monarchs that ever ruled Persia. The happiness of his subjects was the sole object of his life, and his government was simple and patriarchal. He is said to have introduced 12,000 musicians and singers into Persia from India, 1 a.d. 417. 2 Origin of the Gipsies. Varahran Gor, in about a.d . 430, transported two tribes, called the Getas {Getori) and Sa ,G2d {Sangan or Zingani), who lived in Sindh, forcibly from the banks of the Indus to Baluchistan. Gradually they were forced westward by the pressure of other tribes; in 630 they are found near Susa, on the banks of the Karun. In the time of the Abbassides these tribes were living on the banks, and near the mouths of the Euphrates and Karun,HISTORY OF PERSIA. to divert the common people, whom he had once seen dancing without music. Varahrans favourite hunting ground was the valley of Ujan, thirty-eight miles north of Persepolis, on the road to Isfahan. It is also called the c Valley of Heroes: It possesses the finest pastures in Persia, and abounds in game. Here Varahran built a palace, and passed his time in hunting the strong and fleet wild ass, or the timid antelope. 1 This king was proud of his excellence in archery, and kept up a communication with their brethren on the Indus. Some of them were pirates in the Persian Gulf, and all were thievish and very unmanageable. They still preserve their religion and Hindustani language. In a.d . 800-20, the Abbasside Khalifah ravaged their country, and carried of 87,000 families to the northward, stationing them in the ates of Cilicia, near Tarsus. Here they remained over 200 years. Thence they were pushed on by the Muhammadan armies, through Asia Minor ; forming as it were a buffer between the Greeks and Saracens. They are mentioned in the wars between the Saljukians and Greek Emperors. In 1380 they crossed the Bosphorus. In 1400 they are found on the Thracian side; whence they wandered, as Gipsies, to Bohemia, and other parts of Europe. Mug . ^face' in Gipsy and Hindustani.

He was tenderly attached to a female slave named Dilaran, who accom panied him in his parties of pleasure. One day the king encountered a lion, and held him for some time by the ears, in spite of his efforts to free himself, exclaiming in verse— 4 1 am as the raging elephant, I am as an active and mighty lion !' Dilaram replied in the same strain ; and Varahran, being struck with the cadence of these acci dental verses, desired the courtiers to produce something in imita tion : but they never went beyond a single distich.SASSANIAN DYNASTY. 81 and on one occasion he brought his favourite wife to the valley of Oujan, to exhibit his skill in her presence. An antelope was found asleep, and he shot an arrow with such precision as to graze its ear. The animal awoke, and put up its hind hoof to its head. Another arrow transfixed the hoof to the ear. Varahran turned to his lady, in expectation of warm praises, but she coolly observed, ' Practice Enraged at this uncourtly observation, he ordered her to be sent into the mountains to perish; but her life was saved by Varahran's good and able minister, Meher Narsi, who allowed her to retire to a small village, where she lodged in an upper chamber, to which she ascended by a flight of twenty steps. On her arrival the young girl bought a small calf, which she regularly carried up and down stairs every day. This exercise she continued for four years, and her strength gra dually increased with the weight of the animal. Varahran, who supposed his favourite to be dead, once stopped at the village, and was astonished to see a young woman carrying a great cow up a flight of twenty steps. He sent to enquire how so delicate a girl could perform such a feat, but she refused to com municate her secret to any one but the king. Varahran went to the house, and on repeating his admiration at what he had seen, the lady raised her veil, and coolly observed, 'Practice makes Delighted with that love which had led her to pass four years in an endeavour to regain his esteem, Varahran embraced his long lost favourite, and they lived very happily together, until they were separated by death.

The valley of Oujan abounds in springs, whose sources form very dangerous morasses, and the king suddenly plunged with his horse into one of them, and was never seen again. He was succeeded by his son Yezdegird II., 1 a wise and brave prince, who retained Meher Narsi, the able minister of his father, in his councils. Hormazd III., the son of Yezdegird II., was deposed by his brother Firuz, with the aid of a king of Turan named Khusli Nuaz. In 464 Vagharsh succeeded his father Firuz, but was deposed by his brother Kubad,' 2 who also received aid from the wandering tribes of Turan. This king loved a beautiful lady of Nishapur, and by her he had a son ; who afterwards succeeded his father, as Naushir- wan, the most renowned of the kings of the Sassanian dynasty. When Naushirwan ascended the throne, in a.d . 530, he ordered all bridges to be repaired, new edifices to be built, and encouraged schools and colleges.

He intended to have made measurement of all the arable land of Persia, for the purpose of ascertaining an equitably fixed revenue; but his plans were stopped by death. The Sassanian kings, when calamity overtook the crops of a village, indemnified the cultivators for their seed out of the treasury. They said:' The cultivator is our partner in profit; how then shall we not share with him in loss ? '—Baillie On t Tax, p. 19.

His virtues and talents shed a lustre even on those of the great monarch who employed them. He is said to have introduced the games of chess and draughts from India into Persia. Naushirwan introduced excellent arrangements for the government of the different provinces, and esta blished a fixed and moderate land tax throughout his dominions. 1 But the most useful and durable monu ment of the Sassanian kings is the famous dyke at Shuster, 2 commenced by Shapiir I., and completed by JSTaushirwUn. The dyke, which is still perfect, is made of cut stones, cemented by lime and fastened together by clamps of iron, 20 feet broad and 1,200 feet long. In the centre there are two small arches, so as to allow part of the river Karun to flow in its natural bed, while the rest of the water is led off to irrigate the beautiful and fertile plain of Shuster. This is a far more glorious monument of the Sassanians than the palaces that they were accused of constantly erecting for their own selfish gratification. 1 He adopted the plans of his father Kubad. He instituted a land measure of sixty square Tcisseryguz ; and, computing the produce of such a quantity of land to be a Jcufiz (valued at 3 dirhems), he determined that a third part should be the proportion of revenue.

Naushirwan, in his war with the Romans, though twice checked by Belisarius, captured Antioch, and advanced to the shores of the Mediterranean. On the other side he crossed the Oxus, and forced several nations of Turan, India, and Arabia to acknowledge liis sway 5 while the Emperor of China sought his friendship, and sent an embassy to his court. 1 But Naushirvvan was more famous for his justice than for his conquests. A Eoman ambassador, who was sent to his court at Ctesiphon, while admiring the beautiful view from the windows of the king s palace, remarked an uneven piece of ground, and asked the reason why it was not rendered uniform. ' It is the property of an old woman,' said a Persian noble,' who has objections to selling it, though often requested to do so by the king, and he is more willing to have his prospect spoilt than to commit violence.' ' That irregular spot,' replied the Eoman, ' consecrated as it is by justice, appears more beautiful than all the sur rounding scene.' 2 Naushirwan built the palace of Tak Kesra, the ruins of which are all that remains of the city of Ctesi j phon on the Tigris. The facade is covered with stories 1 Nauslunvan carried his arms to Farganah and India : the first place certainly, as his invasion is mentioned in Chinese records.— De Guignes, vol. ii. p. 469.

This great arch is still standing, after a lapse of 1,300 years, for it was erected in about 550 a.d . Naushirwan also founded a city, on the road be tween Ctesiphon and Susa, in a valley which runs out westerly from the plain of Sirwan, and on the northern acclivity of a spur of the Zagros Mountains. The ruins still exist, and are the most perfect remains of a Sassanian city in Persia. The buildings are com posed of massive stone walls, cemented with a lime plaster from the neighbouring hills. They all have a foundation of arched subterranean vaults, above which was a single arched passage, divided into several apartments, surrounding a court-yard. In a few cases there are remains of a second story, also arched ; but beams of wood appear never to have been made use of in these Sassanian buildings. Flowers and rude patterns may still be discerned upon the cement patterns of the interior walls. The buildings are crowded together, and are about a mile in extent. Xaushirwan died in 578, and was buried at et-Tiis, in Khur&amp;s&amp;n. At his death the Empire of Persia extended from the Eed Sea to the Caspian, from the Euxine to the distant banks of the Jaxartes, and from the Mediterranean to the Indus. But Iran had attained to the height of her prosperity, and this brilliant reign only preceded her fall by about sixty years. Naushirwan's favourite saying was, 'That man is the greatest who is least dependent on worldly means for his enjoyment.'86 history of persia. This great king was succeeded by his son Hormazd IV., who had been educated by Abuzurg-a-Mihir, the famous minister of Naushirwan, and often called by Roman writers the Seneca of the East. 1 Soon after his accession rebellions broke out in various parts of the empire, and he was eventually dethroned by Khusru Parviz, his own son, who succeeded him. Khusru Parviz put down the insurgents with the aid of the Greek Emperor Maurice ; but on the death of his benefactor he invaded Syria, took Jerusalem in a.d. 611, and brought the wood of the true cross, inclosed in a golden box, in triumph to Ctesiphon. His victorious armies then conquered Egypt and Asia Minor, and for ten years a Persian camp was established on the shores of the Bosphorus, threatening the city of Constantinople. It was during the brief period of his occupation of Syria that Khusru Parviz is believed, by Mr. Fer- gusson, to have erected the wonderful palace of Mashita, in Moab, recently discovered and described by Mr. Tristram. He carried away many Greek and Syrian workmen, and it is supposed that he employed some of them to erect a hunting box in Moab, for his sojourn when he passed that way, for he was pas sionately attached to the chase. Mr. Tristram re marks, in his work on Moab, that a Persian architect employing Byzantine workmen might be expected 1 Hormazd put the virtuous and learned Abuzurg to death, on a suspicion that he had become a Christian. Mtrkhund calls him 1 The embellished frontispiece of the volume of wisdom.'SASSANIAN DYNASTY. 87 to produce just such a work as this palace of Ma- shita. 1 Khusru Parviz also sent a large army into Yemen, under AValiraz, who subdued that country, with Ha- dramaut and 'Oman. Khusru Parviz enjoyed with ostentation the fruits of his victories, 2 and indulged in every kind of luxury and extravagance, forming a mournful contrast to the real greatness of his glorious grandsire Nauslnrwan. Dastajird, 8 the splendid palace of Khusru Parviz, was sixty miles north of the city of Ctesiphon. The adjacent pastures were covered with flocks and herds, and the park was full of pheasants, peacocks, roebucks, and wild boars; 900 elephants, 6,000 horses and mules, and 8,000 camels were always kept there for the use of the great king and his retinue; and 40,000 columns of marble and plated wood supported the roof of the palace. There still exist the remnants of a capacious edifice, with numbers of subterranean vaulted chambers under it. The great hall is 60 feet square, and entered by four arched doors, and the walls are 12 feet thick and 40 feet high, but the roof has fallen in. In this superb retreat Khusru Parviz enjoyed the society of the lovely Shirin, whose beauty has been the constant theme of Persian poets. A youth, named 1 The Land of Moah, by H. B. Tristram, F.E.S.

Ferhad, fell so deeply in love with Sliirin, that Khusru Parviz declared he would resign her, if the lover could cut through an immense rock called Besitun, about twenty miles north of KirmansMh, and bring a stream from one side of the hill to the other. When Ferhad was on the point of completing his almost superhuman labour, an old woman was sent to tell him that Shirin was dead; for Khusru Parviz had become alarmed lest he should complete his work, and claim his reward. The wretched youth, on hearing the destruction of his hopes, clasped his hands above his head, and, jumping off the highest part of the rock, was dashed to pieces. The remains of Ferhad's labour are still to be seen at the eastern end of the long range of barren moun tains that bound the plain of Kirmanshah on the north. They terminate abruptly in a high perpen dicular rock, in one place cut to a smooth surface, and projecting over the road like a canopy. (Hence the name of Besitun, from situn, a pillar,' and ' with out.') Near this, on a high part of the rock, a group of figures, in the form of a procession, is sculptured. 1 While Khusru Parviz was in the full enjoyment of his prosperity, which he bore so ill, he received a most ominous message. He was encamped on the banks of the rapid river Kara-su, which falls into the Tigris, when a letter was put into his hands, from an 1 There are mtich more ancient inscriptions at Besitun, carved by order of Darius Hystaspes.

He rejected the invitation, and threw the epistle into the river. ' It is thus,' exclaimed the messenger, ' that God will tear the kingdom, and reject the sup plications of Khusru.' It is remarkable that from this time nothing but disaster followed the once fortunate king ; the Eomans reduced him to the verge of destruction; and the followers of Muhammad, whose message he had de spised, had, in a few short years, utterly overthrown the great Persian Empire. The Eoman emperor, Heraclius, who for years had been confined, by the inroads of the Persians and Avars, almost within the walls of his capital, had no sooner collected a small army, than he at once dis played extraordinary military talent, and entirely re trieved his fortunes. In his first campaign he success fully invaded Syria ; in his second he crossed the Black Sea, landed at Trebizond, overran Georgia, and even penetrated into Persia itself, as far as Isfahan. In his third campaign 1 he entirely defeated Khusru Parviz, in a great battle on the site of ancient Nineveh, captured and destroyed his splendid palace at Dastajird, and triumphantly restored the true cross to Jerusalem. These long wars brought unaccustomed misery on the people, and several insurrections broke out in the different provinces. The unfortunate Khusru Parviz was thrown into prison and put to death by his own son Shirftyah; and the beautiful Shirin poisoned herself over his grave. 2 1 A.D. 622. 1 A.D. 628.HISTOEY OF PERSIA. The life of this wretched king presents one of the most remarkable vicissitudes of fortune in history, but Khusru Parviz had never borne his prosperity well; he had oppressed the countries that were conquered by his armies, and his reign forms a striking contrast to that of the good Naushirwan. His son Shiruyah 1 concluded an ignominious treaty with the Eoman Emperor Heraclius, but died after a reign of a few months. Anarchy then began to prevail throughout Persia; Pur an Dukht and Azarmi Dukht, 2 two daughters of Khusru Parviz, succeeded each other on the throne, and were both murdered by the turbulent nobles of Ctesiphon; and in 032 Yezde- o-ird III. the son of Shahriar, the son of Khusru Parviz by Shirin, ascended the throne, and for a few years held, with a trembling and unsteady hand, the reins of the tottering government. But the fierce and fanatic Arabs, wrought up to a pitch of intense devotion by their new religion, were already gathering, in threatening masses, on the frontier of the doomed empire of Iran. The young king, of a mild and generous disposition, was weak and inexperienced, having passed his early life in seclusion at the ancient city of Istakar. The command of the Persian forces was intrusted to a general named Eustam, who had formerly been governor of Khu- r&amp;siln. The Saracens, under the renowned Saad ibn Abu WakMs, a friend of the Prophet, advanced across the Euphrates, and the two armies encountered each other on the plain of el-KMinyyah, in 636 A.D. 1 Siroes of the Greeks. 2 Arzemia of the Greeks.SASSANIAN DYNASTY. 91 For three days and nights the battle raged with great fury. The heroes of Mn, not unworthy of their mighty ancestors, performed prodigies of valour; but their valour availed nothing. On the third day the Persian host was routed, Eustam was killed, and the hallowed apron of the blacksmith Kaf fell into the hands of the enemy. 1 The conquering Muhammadans then marched upon Ctesiphon, the capital of the empire, and Yezdegird fled to Holwan, at the foot of the hills of Azerbaijan. The splendid palaces of Ctesiphon became a prey to the Avild Arabs; inestimable works of art, jewels, gold and silver, were shared amongst the rude soldiery, and the city was then abandoned. Nothing now remains of it but a part of the palace of Khusru Parviz, seen afar on the plain. The bricks, of which it is built, are as hard as granite, with their surfaces nearly as polished as porcelain. The city walls, of great thickness, may also be traced. 2 Saad then sent a detachment in pursuit of the fallen king, who had taken refuge in the stronghold of Holwan, 3 on the road between Ctesiphon and Kirman- shah. The fortress of Holwan, which is also called Kalahi- Yezdegird, immediately overhangs the modern town of Zohab. It is formed by a shoulder, projecting west- 1 It had been enlarged from time to time, with silk and gold embroidery, until it was 22 feet long, and 15 broad.

On the fourth, it was defended by a wall and dry ditch of colossal dimensions, drawn across from one precipitous scarp to the other, a distance of about two miles. The wall was flanked by bastions at regular intervals, and was about 50 feet high and 20 in thickness. The hill itself is 2,000 feet above the plain of Zohab, and the fortified table-land on its summit covers an area of about 10 square miles. Sir H. Eawlinson says it must have been perfectly impregnable, in an age when artillery was unknown. The names of many places in the neighbourhood still retain vestiges of the last of the Sassanian kings.' In an adjacent gorge there is a natural cave, very difficult of access, called the Haram-Khanah of the princess Shahr-banu, the daughter of Yezdegird, and wife of the Imam Hasan. At the foot of the gorge is the little village of Zardah, surrounded by gardens, which are watered by a delicious stream; and here there are the remains of two contiguous palaces, called the Diwan-Khanah and Haram-Khanah of Yezdegird. The one, a quadrangular building, 100 yards square, of which the foundations alone remain; the other, a large enclosure, containing the remains of numerous buildings. The architecture is in a rude and massive style. The river Holwan rises 20 miles east of Zohab, in the gorge of Eijab, which Sir H. Eawlinson describes as one of the most beautiful spots he has seen in the East. It is very narrow, scarcely 60 yards in width,SASSANIAN DYNASTY. 93 and closed in by a line of tremendous precipices on either side. From one end to the other it is filled with gardens and orchards, through which the stream tears its foaming way, till it emerges into the plain below, near Zardah. The defile is famous for its delicious fruit; and an Arabian writer says that, ' the figs of Holwan are not to be equalled in the whole world.' The unfortunate Yezdegird, with his demoralised troops, dared not even to make a stand in the impreg nable fortress of Holwan ; 1 but, on the approach of the Arabs, he fled to Istakar, thence to Sistan, and thence to Merv, on the confines of Khurasan. Meanwhile the Muhammadans besieged a part of the remnant of the Persian host in the fortress of Jabula, near Holwan, and captured the place, after a gallant defence of six months. For the few following years the Persians prepared to make a last desperate struggle for their in dependence ; while the Muhammadans, under the com mand of Eum&amp;n ibn Mukry, concentrated their forces to complete the conquest of Iran. In 641, the Arabians marched from el-Kufah to the plain of Nevahend, about forty miles from Hamadan, where the last remnant of the Persian army, commanded by a nobleman named Firfiz, was intrenched in a strong position. After skirmishing for two months, the army of Mn came out to battle; but the onslaught of the Muhammadans was irresistible ; 30,000 Persians were 1 Holwan is the Caldh of Asshur (Genesis x. 11), and the Halah of Israelitish captivity (2 Kings xviii. 11). The neighbourhood abounds in ruins of the Sassanian times. r\i94 HISTOEY OF PEKSIA. pierced by their lances, and Firuz was killed in the retreat. The battle of Nevahend decided the fate of Persia; the cities of Hamadan, IsfaMn, Kazvin, and Istakhar surrendered after a slight resistance; and the empire fell under the yoke of the fanatic Caliph 'Omar. After wandering as a fugitive for several years, Yezdegird once more came to Merv, where the governor offered to give up his king to the Khakan of TCiran. The ill-fated prince fled alone, and on foot, from the town. He reached a mill eight miles from Merv; and the miller killed him while he was asleep, for the sake of his splendid clothes, and cast his body into the mill stream. 1 But the villain was put to death by the people of Merv, and the body of the last of the Persian kings was conveyed to Istakar, and buried in the sepulchre of his ancestors. Yezdegird left two sons, Firuz and Varahran, and a daughter who married Hasan, the son of 'Aly and Fatimah, and grandson of Muhammad. She had a numerous progeny. Firuz, the son of Yezdegird, left two daughters in Persia, one of whom married the Khalifah Walid, and was mother of the Khalifah Yezid ; and the other, named Dara, became the wife of Bostenay, the Chief of the Jews in Mesopotamia, called the Prince of Firuz himself fled across the deserts of Turan, and sought shelter at the court of Tait Sung, the Emperor of China. He was kindly received, appointed to the post of Captain of the Guard, and granted the palace and large estate of Sigan, in the north-western part of 1 August, a.d . 651.SASSANIAN DYNASTY, 95 China. Here a small colony of fugitives from Iran col lected round him, and long retained the ancient religion and usages of Zoroaster in their exile. Firuz left a son named Narses, called by the Chinese Ni-ni-cha; and Gibbon says that his grandson, after a faint and fruitless enterprise, ended his days in the palace of Sigan. 1 Yezdegird was the last sovereign of the house of Sassan : a dynasty which ruled Persia for 415 years; and, says Malcolm, 'the memory of which is still cherished by a nation whose ancient glory is associated with the fame of Ardeshir, of Shapiir, and of Naushir- wlm.' The kings of the Sassanian dynasty were a very handsome race of the pure Aryan type. We learn this fact from their coins, of which there is almost a complete series ; as well as from the rock sculptures. Shapiir I. was famous for his manly beauty, and the tradition is borne out by the bas-relief copied by Flandin, and reproduced by Mr. Thomas. In this bas-relief his head is encircled by a cap, from the sides of which rise eagle's wings, and the whole is surmounted by a globe. The monarch wears bushy side curls, and a beard tied at the point, and merging into a jewelled drop. The head of Varahran Kirmanshah, carved on the amethyst now in the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, is also that of a man of extraordinary personal beauty, with large eyes, prominent well formed nose, and firm 1 Gibbon's Decline and Fall, ch. li.

Similar handsome faces, with a strong family- likeness, are represented on all the coins ; which some times have a c|ueen or eldest son associated with the monarch. On the reverses of the Sassanian coins are fire altars, apparently the portable altars carried before the kings in processions. 1 The pure religion of Zoroaster was overthrown by the Arabs. Its mobeds, or priests, were slaughtered in great numbers, many fled to India and China, and the people who remained faithful to their ancient creed were cruelly persecuted by their fanatical conquerors. The town of Yezd, at the present day, contains 6,600 honest and industrious Ghebres, or fire-worshippers; and the Parsis of Bombay still retain the religion of Zoro aster, and are the most worthy, industrious, and honest portion of the native population of India. Jonas Han way tells us that, ten miles n.e . of Baku the Caspian sea-port, on a dry rocky waste, there are several ancient stone fire temples. In one of them, near the altar, there was, in his time, a large hollow cone, from the end of which issued a blue flame. The Ghebres declare that it is everlasting, and that it has continued ever since the Flood. In former days devout pilgrims used to flock to the sacred flame in great numbers. 1 For interesting notices of the Sassanian coins, gems, sculptuies, and inscriptions, see Early Sassanian by Edward Thomas, Esq. (Trlibner, 1868); and the Chronicle, vol. xii. N. S. 1871-72, p. 280. See also the magnificent work of Flandin.98 HISTORY OF PERSIA. THE PARSlS. A B&amp;DYof Ghebres or Parsis took refuge in the Isle of Or muz, and thence sailed to India. The first port they landed at was Diu, in the Gulf of Cambay. Thence they removed, in a.d . 717, to San- jan, 5' south of Damaun, where they found favour in the eyes of Jadao Rana, the ruler of the place, and were permitted to reside. Several successive emigrations took place afterwards. The Parris built a fire temple at Sanjan, in 721, and kindled the sacred fire. For 300 years they lived in peace, during which time they settled at Surat, Broach, Gambay, and Nausari. In 1507 the Parsis of Sanjan assisted the Rajah against a Muslim invader from Ahmadabad. They behaved with great valour under their leader Ardeshlr, and defeated the Muslims; but in a second battle Ardeshir fell, and the Muslim Aluf Khan occupied i anjan. The Parsis fled to Nausari, where their brethren had become an opulent and influential race. The sacred fire was finally re moved to Udwara, 36 miles south of Surat. At Surat the Parsis carried ou business as brokers to European fh-ms; and in 1662 they came to Bombay. An early settler was one Lowjee, a shipwright, who superintended the building of the E. I. C.'s vessels. Under his supervision the Bombay dockyard was founded in 1735, and the post of master builder of the yard has ever since been filled by descendants of Lowjee. Of the Parsis or Ghebres who remained in the fatherland, thefe were 1,000 families, or 6,658 souls inYezd and its vicinity, iu 1854: at Kirman, 450; Tehran, 50, chiefly gardeners, and a few shop keepers at Shiraz. They are very ignorant, most of their books having been destroyed during Agha Muhammad's tyranny. But centuries of oppression have not been able to destroy the stiong, muscular, and hardy appearance of the Zoroastrian. He is greatly superior in strength to the modern Persian, and very industrious. Ghebres are employed in a garden adjoining the Shah's harem at Tehran, being chosen on account of their character for purity an honesty. But a heavy poll tax is imposed on the Ghebres, an great cruelties are often practised on thero.THE PARSfS.

Total of Parsis and Ghebres . . . 138,563 The Parsis in Bombay are divided into two sects, called Shahar- sahis or Easamis and Kadmis, not differing in doctrine, but merely as to the date for the computation of the era of King Yezdegird, whence they count their years. Parsi children, at the age 6 years and 3 months, are admitted into the religion of Zoroaster. The child is seated before the Dus- tur (priest), who pronounces a benediction; the kusti, a woollen cord of 72 threads, is then passed 3 times round the waist, and tied in 4 knots, during the chaunting of a hymn. The first work, wherever the Parsis settle, is to build a tomb (dokhma), called L the tower of silence,' for their dead. The body is carried to the dofchma, generally in a solitary place (those at Bombay are built on the highest part of Malabar Hill), and, being placed on an iron bier, is exposed in the doJchma. The fowls of the air soon denude it of flesh, and the bones fall through an iron grating into a pit beneath, whence they are removed to a subterranean chamber, made for the purpose. In Bombay there are 3 fire temples—built in 1780, in 1830, and in 1844, respectively. The earliest Parsis of wealth and position at Bombay all raised themselves from obscurity by their individual enterprise; and Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy himself was the son of poor parents. There is now a Parsi mercantile house established in London (Messrs. Cama and Co.). The Parsis are upright and honourable in their dealings, their word is their bond. They have shared largely in the establishment of railways and banks; a number of them are shipowners ; many devote themselves to the improvement of large landed property, and the finest houses in Bombay are owned by them. Sir John Malcolm said :—' There is no body of natives in India so remarkable for their intelligence and enterprise as the Parsis.' Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy was the most generous merchant in India; Jamsetjee Dorabjee was the foremost native railway con tractor; Kustamjee Byramjee obtained, by public competition, in 1857, a commission as assistant-surgeon on the Bombay establish ment Dadabhoy Naorosjee was lately Professor of Natural Philo- u 2 ■100 HISTOEY OF PEESIA. sophy in the Elphinstone Institution ; Dosabhoy Framjee was editor of the Bombay Times, author of a History of the Parsees, and of a work called the British Raj-, and Framjee Nusserwanjee, Cowasjee Jehangir, and Manockjee Nusserwanjee, are opulent Parsis, famous for their acts of generosity and of benevolence. Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy has at different times released many prisoners confined in jail for debt; built causeways, for the benefit o£ the public, between Bombay and Salsette ; erected hospitals; es tablished institutions for relief of the poor at Bombay, Surat, Nan- sari, and other places; and built works for the supply of water. To the poor, the needy, and distressed, he has always held out a helping hand, without reference to race or creed. Sir Jamsetjee was knighted in 1842. In 1843 he received ^ gold medal, set in diamonds, from the Queen; and in 1858 he was created a baronet, settling ^10,000 a year on the baronetcy; to w T hich Sir Cursetjee Jamsetjee has since succeeded.

The Khal T he ominous message which the great Persian king, Khusru Parviz received on the banks of the Kdra-su, was the forerunner of one of the most stupendous revo lutions the world has ever witnessed: a revolution which extended its influence over the whole of Asia, Northern Africa, and Spain.; and which has continued to direct the destinies of many races of men to the pre sent day. In no country has it established a more en during and universal influence than in Persia ; and some account of the rise and progress of IslUm is, there fore, necessary to complete a historical sketch of that country. The numerous wandering tribes of Arabia, divided into two great branches—the descendants of Joktan and of Ishmael—had never, before the rise' of Muhammad, directed their ambition beyond the limits of their own sandy deserts. The children of Ishmael were the most warlike and powerful of these tribes. Many of them wandered over the deserts, plundering caravans, and dwelling in tents, by the side of wells which are scattered at vast intervalsTHE KHALlFAHS. over the trackless wilds. Others collected together in towns, near the sea coasts, and became eminent, as well for the success of their commercial enterprises, as for the poetry and apothegms composed by some of their members. The most renowned of the descendants of Ishmael were the people of the tribe of Kuraish, whose founder Fihr (surnamed Kuraish, or the ' Sea Monster') was lineally sprung from the outcast son of the patriarch Abraham. The Kuraish, under the leadership of the head of their tribe had, during the fifth century, seized upon the sovereignty of the ancient city of Mekkah, and the guardianship of the Ka'abah, where the idols most vene rated by all the tribes of Arabia were preserved. The Arabs of the Kuraish worshipped a strange idol, called el-'Uzza, the 'Exalted One,' studied the motions of the planets, and the positions of the fixed stars, and en riched the ports of the Eed Sea by their commerce. The head of their family was Prince of Mekkah. In the middle of the sixth century, Abd-Manaf, sur named el-Kdmar, or 6 The Moon,' from the beauty of his countenance, was Prince of Mekkah, and chief of the noble tribe of Kuraish. At that time an army headed by an Abyssinian chief, and accompanied by elephants, advanced against Mekkah. A war ensued^ and Hashim, the son of 'Abd-Manaf, distinguished himself above the brethren of his tribe ; in consequence of which his posterity obtained a kind of tacit ascendancy in the Kuraish. But, though for the moment less powerful, yet not104 HISTORY OF PERSIA. less remarkable for their valour and other noble quali ties, were the children of Omeyyah, a grandson of 'Abd-Manaf, and these rival families divided the tribe into Hashimites and Omeyyahs. Muhammad, 1 the son of 'Abdallah by the beautiful Aminah, and great-grandson of Hashim, was born in 572. Though bom to poverty, he managed, by his extraordinary talent and audacityj to assume the lead among the Hashimites, declaring himself to be the Prophet of God; while, at about the same time, the august and noble Abu-Sufyan, grandson of Omeyyah, became chief of the Kuraish. The strange doctrine of Muhammad soon began to excite attention; and while, on the one hand, he made converts of many influential Arabs, among whom were his cousin Aly, Abu-Bekr, afterwards his father-in-law, Saad, 'Othman, Ez-Zubair, Abdu-'r-Eahman, 'Omar, and Hamzah ; on the other, he excited great uneasiness in the minds of the elders of the Kuraish. When, at length, the earnest preaching of the reformer began to disturb the tranquillity of Mekkah, Abu-Sufyan formed a league against him, with most of the chiefs of his tribe. The enmity of these men was not to be despised; and Muhammad^ after concealing himself for some time in the cave of Tur, with the faithful Abu-Bekr, where he composed many chapters of the Kur&amp;a, 2 fled to el-Medinah, 0 in 622. Here the townspeople readily 1 Muhammad means ' the praised one,' or ' one endowed with praiseworthy qualities.' 2 Kuran, ' the Reading, Book'; from to read.' 3 This flight was called* ty-IIijrah, from the root 'toTHE KHAliFAHS. 105 gave in their adherence to the new religion, and the Prophet soon found himself at the head of a formidable body of men. The trade of the merchants of Mekkah was, at that time, very considerable. Within forty miles of the gates of the city was the port of Juddah on the Bed Sea, whence came the produce of Abyssinia. From Yemen came myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and other merchandise. Which was conducted in long caravans across the desert to Syria; and the returning merchants brought back precious goods from the marts of the East. A year after the Hijrah, Muhammad received tidings that Abu-Sufyan was escorting a caravan from Syria to Mekkah, and he determined to attack it. He therefore advanced to a place called Bedr, about twenty miles from el-Medmah, and attacked the caravan, which he succeeded in capturing, after great slaughter. Many prisoners were taken, among whom was the Prophet's uncle AbMs, who was the ancestor of a long line of Khalifahs. Abu-Sufyan, however, retreated in good order to Mekkah. Furious at the loss of so many of their kindred, and at the plunder of their caravan, preparations were im mediately made by the people of Mekkah to punish the audacity of the fanatics at el-Medinah. The reserve of the new army was led by Hinda, the wife of Abu-Sufyan, who vowed vengeance against Hdmzah, the murderer of her kinsmen. ■flee'; and from it the Muslims count their year. July 17, A.D. 622.106 HISTORY OF PERSIA. In 625 Abu-Sufytui advanced against Muhammad, who came forth to meet him with about a thousand men, and encamped on a hill called Uhud, about four miles north of el-Medinah. After a partial success, the Muslims were entirely defeated, but retired in good order, leaving several of their leaders dead on the field. Among these was Hamzah, whose body was insulted, and whose heart was torn out, and gnawed by the revengeful Hinda. In 627 the Kuraish formed the siege of el-Medinah with 12,000 men, but it was raised; and during the following years the influence of Muhammad spread so rapidly, and he gained so many converts among the neighbouring tribes of Arabia, that he was in a position to bid defiance to the Kuraish at Mekkah, and make a truce with them on equal terms. During the continuance of the truce, Muhammad marched suddenly upon Mekkah, and Abu -Sufyim, wlio came out to meet him, was taken prisoner. Entering the city when its inhabitants were completely off their guard, he firmly established his authority there in 629, destroyed the idols of the Ka'abah, 360 in number, and forced the whole tribe of Kuraish to embrace Islam. A few of his greatest enemies were put to a cruel death, several escaped; but the remainder, including the lady Ilinda, the ruthless enemy of the Faithful were pardoned. So great, however, was the respect and fear which the Prophet still felt for Abu-Sufyan, the chief of the Kuraish, that he was treated with the utmost con-THE KHALtFAHS. 107 sideration. Finding that fortune had turned against him, and convinced by the arguments of reason, and the still stronger one of necessity, he deemed it con sistent with his dignity to embrace the new doctrine, and to profess, with his family, a belief that there was one only God, and that his cousin Muhammad was his Prophet. He himself became leader of part of the forces; and his son Mu'awiyah was appointed secretary to Mu hammad, who had previously married Umm-Habibah, a daughter of Abu-Sufy&amp;n. From this time the house of Omeyyah advanced rapidly in power. Muhammad died in 632, and his three immediate successors were his old companions, Abu-Bekr, 'Omar, and 'Othm&amp;n. 1 During their reigns the conquests of the Muhammadans extended with unprecedented rapidity. The Arabs, accustomed for ages to confine their wanderings to the deserts of their own country, and to pass their lives in breeding superb horses, and tending camels, flocks, and herds, rapidly received a surprising stimulus from their new creed, formed themselves into large armies, and invaded the neighbouring countries to spread the true faith by force of arms. Syria, after a few campaigns, was conquered, and the Khalifah 2 'Omar entered Jerusalem in triumph. 1 632. Abu-Bekr, i.e., ' the Father of Bekr.' His daughter Aishah married Muhammad. 634. 'Omar.

'Amru, one of the greatest of Muhammadan generals, overran Egypt, and, by the Khalifah's order, burnt the priceless library of Alexandria; and the mighty empire of Persia, whose kings had once defeated and led in chains the emperors of Eome, was shattered at one blow, on the plains of el-Kadinyyah. Its stately religion was driven from the temples of Ctesiphon and Istakhar to the recesses of mountain fastnesses ; and the scorn and hatred in which it was held by true believers, is exemplified by the tales concerning Bahrain the Magian, in the Arabian N A few poor fire- worshippers in Tezd, and the Parsis of Bombay, now represent that religion of fire and the sun which, in times gone by, counted millions upon millions of votaries. While the conquests of the Muhammadans were thus spreading far and wide, Mu'awiyah, the son of Abu-Sufyan, had succeeded in establishing himself as Governor of Syria. The Ehalifah 'Othman was assassinated in 655, and Aly, who had married Fatimah, the daughter of Mu hammad, was inaugurated in the mosque at el-Medinah; but Mu'awiyah refused to take the oath of allegiance, and even claimed the khalifate for himself. Aly, whose arm was far stronger than his head, and who, though possessing many fine qualities. Was quite un fitted for supreme command, succumbed before his adversary, and was assassinated while officiating in the mosque of el-Kufali, in 660. He is described as rather short, with a youthful and frequently smiling coun tenance, large eyes, a long beard, and bald head. HeTHE KHALtFAHS. 109 was very brave and generous, and possessed a remark ably sweet temper. Soon after his death, a numerous sect of believers sprang up, called SMa'ah, who declared that 'Aly, his two sons, Hasan and Husain, and the descendants of the latter, were the true Imams; and that a behef in their inalienable right constitutes the most important article of the faith. 'Aly's two sons, when they were little children, were the favourites of the prophet Muhammad, who often took them into the pulpit with him when he ad dressed the people. Hasan 1 succeeded his father.; and, ascending the pulpit, he thus spoke to a great multitude which was assembled at el-Kufah, to wit ness his inauguration:—' You have killed a man on the same night in which the Kuran came down from heaven, in which 'Isa (Jesus) went up to heaven, and in which Joshua, the son of Nun, was slain. None of his predecessors excelled him, nor will any of his successors be ever equal to him.' Hasan, who was of a mild and unwarlike disposition, resigned the khalifate to the ambitious Mu'awiyah, and enjoyed the pleasures of a private life at el-Medinah for eight years, when he was poisoned by one of his wives named Ja'adah, who had been bribed by the new Ehalifah. Hasan married the princess Shahr-banu, daughter of Yezdegird, the last of the Sassanian kings of Persia. Thus the head of the house of Omeyyah, the son of 1 Hasan means 1 handsome.'110 HISTORY OF PERSIA, the most formidable of the enemies of Muhammad, became his KhaUfah, or Successor ; and by establishing an hereditary dynasty, and introducing the luxuries and arts of civilised life, completely altered the whole tone of society among the true believers. Hitherto the Successors of the Prophet had been simple in their mode of life, and by their dress and appearance might have been mistaken for the meanest of their subjects. 'Omar, dressed in a coarse cloth, and seated on the ground before the door of a mosque, received embassies from the greatest kings of the earth. Mu'slwiyah changed all this. The seat of government was removed to the beautiful city of Damascus, the Khalifah adopted the gorgeous style of former Eastern potentates, and the arts and sciences of their neigh bours were rapidly introduced among the formerly rude and austere Muslims. Eetaining the same zeal for proselytism and lust of conquest, as characterised the first outburst of IsMm, the followers of Muhammad gradually allowed their religion to assume a milder and more refined form; and amidst the grumbling of a few old bigots, splen did mosques and palaces began to rise in Damascus, and other large towns of the empire. The worship of one supreme God, and veneration for his Prophet, or exponent upon earth, was, in theory, a sublime conception, and elevated the minds of the subjects of the Khalifahs above the wretched idolatries practised by the ancestors of most of the conquered peoples. The Persians alone may be excepted.THE KHALIFAIIS. Ill The prayers and observances of the Faithful were simple and beautiful. Morning and evening they turned their faces towards Mekkah, and repeated the ' Fdtihah,' 1 or opening verses of the Kuran :— ' In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compas sionate! Praise [belongeth] to God, Lord of all creatures, the Merciful, the Compassionate, the Euler of the Day of Judgment. Thee do we worship, and of Thee do we ask assistance. Direct us in the right way —the way of those to whom Thou hast been gracious ; not of them with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray. Amen,' The devoted faith of those warriors, who with courageous hearts conquered half the civilised world, cannot fail to win the admiration even of the enemies of their religion. It was the fortune of the house of Omeyyah to direct the conquests of these fervent heroes, and to rule an empire extending half round the world—from Lisbon to the confines of China; while, at the same time, they cultivated the arts of peace at Damascus, Towards the close of the reign of Mu'awiyah, his armies laid siege to Constantinople itself, the capital of the Eoman emperors, and for five years were its walls surrounded by the forces of Islam, Thus, in 668, little more than forty years after the obscure Arab enthusiast was first heard of by the nations of the West, a vast fleet and army of his followers threatened the very existence of the Eoman empire.

Mu 'awiyah was succeeded in 680 by his son Yezid, in whose reign the conflicting claims of Hasan and Husain, the sons of 'Aly, were set at rest for ever. Hasan, of a peaceful and gentle disposition, had re signed his right to the khalifate; but his brother Husain raised an army, and defied the power of Yezid. The melancholy fate of this unfortunate prince forms the burden of many a song, and has been told in the agreeable narratives of Washington Irving, and of Curzon. 1 His tragic end, on the plain of Kerbela, in 680, forms the plot of a tragedy which is now acted before the court of the Shah of Persia. Having destroyed all his enemies, Yezid died in 683; ' May he be accursed of God!' exclaims the Arab chronicler. TTis son Mu'awiyah H., 2 became Khalifah when twenty- one years of age. He was a melancholy youth, weak in mind and body ; and was obliged to remain in darkened rooms, on account of a disease in his eyes ; hence his surname, ' The Father of Night. After reigning for six months, he refused to hold office any longer, declining also to name a successor. His grand father, he said, had displaced a better man than him self, as also had his father, 3 and he himself was unfit for so great a post. MarwA,n I., 4 a grandson of Yezid I., and former secre tary to the Khalifah 'Othman, succeeded Mu 'awiyah II. 1 Gurzon, pv 65. 2 3 Meaning 'Aly and Husain. 4 a.d . 683.I THE KHALtFAHS. 113 He was a tall meagre man, with a pale face, and beard dyed yellow. After reigning two years, his wife threw a pillow on his face while he was asleep, and sat upon it until he was smothered. In 685, 'Abd-el-Malik ascended the throne of the Omeyyad Khalifahs. He reigned for twenty years, during which time the conquests of the Arabs in Africa were extended and consolidated, and Carthage was taken from the Greeks. Abd-el-Malik built the mosque el-Aksa at Jerusalem, and converted the Church of St. John, at Damascus, into the principal mosque of the city. Mr. Fergusson observes that these buildings are rude and clumsy, showing that the Arab conquerors had not yet acquired artistic tastes. He is said to have been the first Muhammadan sovereign who coined money. He died of the dropsy in 705. During the rule of his son 1 el-Walld I., 2 extensive conquests added to the already immense extent of the Arabian empire. While on one side Spain was over run by Mdsa and Tarik, on the other his nephew con quered Bukhara, and destroyed the idols of Samarkand. In 706, fifty-five years after the final conquest of Persia, the Arabs under Kutbah, governor of Khurfisan, crossed the Oxus. During the next six years he sub dued Bukhara, Samarkand, and Khuwarizm as far as the Sea of Aral. In 713 he extended his conquests over Farganah to the banks of the Jaxartes. The Khalifah himself, however, was devoted to the refined arts of peace, and remained in his capital of 1 el~TValid) 4 the Begotten,' or 1 the Se^vant. , 2 a.D. 705.114 history of persia,. Damascus. He was tall and robust, with a broad flat nose, and much pitted with the small-pox. In the erection of the ^reat moscjue at Damascus, el~ Walid may be considered to be the founder of the Saracenic order of architecture. Forbidden by their Prophet to make any graven image or representation of man or animal, the Arabs adorned their buildings with ever-varying and intricate patterns, verses from the Kuran in the beautiful Arabic character, and other devices in which they exercised an endless ingenuity. The tall slender pillars, supporting the horse-shoe arch, and domes and minarets formed the chief points of a style of architecture never surpassed for grace and beauty, which rose to its highest state of perfection in the glorious Alhambra. el-Walid 1 also built the great mosque at Damascus, where 600 lamps were suspended by golden chains. He was succeeded by his brother Sulaiman, 2 who was very handsome. It is related that once, as he was ad miring himself in a mirror, and exclaiming to those around him,' I am the king of youth ; a slave girl answered, 'You are beautiful. Who can deny it? This only fault have you, that your beauty is mortal, that it will pass away as a summer breeze, as a flower of ; the field will it fade.' During his reign Georgia and Mazanderau were con quered by his general Yezid-bin-el-Muh'allab; and his brother Maslamah, the greatest general of the house of Omeyyah, led an amy across the Hellespont at 1 He married a daughter of Yezdegird, last king of Persia. 2 A.D. 714.THE KHALIFAHS, 115 Abydos, and the Arabs a second time besieged Con stantinople. Meanwhile the Khalifah Sulaiman advanced with another army through Asia Minor, but died of a surfeit in his camp at Calchis. He had demolished two baskets of eggs and figs, which he ate alternately, a quantity of marrow and sugar, seventy pomegranates, a kid, six fowls, and an immense number of the grapes of et-Taif, in one morning. The siege of Constantinople was then raised. 'Omar, whose mother, Omm-Asma, was a daughter of the great Khalifah 'Omar, succeeded his cousin Sulai- m&amp;n. He was in every respect different from his prede cessor. In all religious observances he was strict, and his virtues add lustre to the dynasty of the Benu-Omeyyah. Gibbon says ' the throne of an active and able prince (meaning Sulaiman, who ate himself to death) was de graded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot.' 1 'Omar was, on the contrary, the best and most humane of the Omeyyah Khalifahs. On the first day of his accession, he prohibited the revolting custom of cursing Aly from the pulpit—a custom which had been io vogue since the time of Mu'awiyah I. He died in 719, and the Arabian poet Sharif, el- Miisawy, said of him, ' 0 son of 'Abdu'l-'Aziz! if human eyes ought to weep, they should weep for you. You 'freed us from the cursing of 'Aly, and, if it is possible, you should be freed from it yourself.' Yezid IL, a son of Abdu-'l-Malik, followed 'Omar in 1 Gibbon, vol. v. p. 180 ; p. 34, i 2HISTORY OF PERSIA. the Klialifate; and lie made the renowned general Maslamah, governor of Khurasan. Yezid was very handsome, and devoted to pleasure. He had two young slave girls, whom he loved far better than himself, named'Habibah and Salimah. Salimah having died, he kept the body in his room until it was decomposed; and being reproved by his brother, he replied, 'They all tell me this, but I have no other alleviation for my grief.' It is said that after she was interred, he again took the beloved remains from the tomb, and looking upon it with wild anguish, he died with his Salimah in his arms, at the early age of twenty-nine. Such love passages are of frequent occurrence among the Benu-Omeyyah princes, as indeed they are through out the records of the first few centuries of Islam, and the stories of the A.vcibicin are confirmed by the authentic testimony of history. No people appear to have loved more deeply than the Arabian youths, when their nation was in its full vigour, and women were adored by them with a chivalric ardour that would have done honour to the knights of Christendom. Though occupying a very different position from the women of Europe, they have exercised an equal in fluence over the minds of men, and on many occasions, as regents and ministers, have risen to the highest stations. Aishah, the wife of Muhammad, led armies to the field, as did Hinda, the spouse of his rival Abu- Sufyan. Nor have they been less eminent in the culti vation of more peaceful pursuits; and among the Arab ladies of Spain, during the reigns of the princes of the house of Omeyyah, there were more poetesses, author-THE KIIALIFAHS. 117 esses, and female literate, than have appeared in any single country, even in modern times. By the religion of Muhammad, though carefully kept from the public gaze, and subjected to much restraint, the women as well as the men were admitted to the joys of Paradise; their husbands were enjoined to treat them with respect and consideration, and the Kuran secured to them many important rights and privileges. In 723, Hish&amp;m succeeded his brother Yezid 11. He had a cast in his eye; and, in imitation of the Prophet, dyed his beard with henna and The inscription on his seal was ' Wise judgment is a fat beast of burden.' His general, Maslamah, made incursions into the Greek dominions, and besieged Nice in Bithynia. He also drove the Turks out of Armenia. In 738, Zaid, the son of Husain, and grandson of 'Aly, rose in rebellion at el-Kftfah,butwas defeated and pierced through the brain with an arrow by the Governor of 'Irak. His body was burnt, his ashes thrown to the winds, and his head placed on the gates of Damascus. Hisham had a mania for dress, and his enormous wardrobe loaded 600 camels. In 747, he was succeeded by his nephew el-Walid II., a son of Yezid U. This Khallfah was impious and care less of religion ; indeed, it is said that towards the end of his life he openly professed Zendicism. He led a dissolute life, bathed in wine, and entered the sanctuary at Mekkah with stag-hounds; but at the same time he loved music and wrote poetry. 1 Kdtam, Buxus dioica, Forsk.Flor. JE&lt;j. Ar. p. 159.218 HISTORY OF PERSIA. But his depravity excited the indignation of all true believers: the cities of Syria rose in rebellion against him, and he was put to death in his palace near Damascus. His head was cut off and nailed on the gates of the town, while his cousin was proclaimed Khalifah as Yezid III. The fall of el-Walid II. was a fatal blow to the house of Omeyyah, and increased the influence of the numerous conspiratoi s m all parts of the empire ; especially that of the family ol Abbasides, descendants of 'AbMs, that uncle of Muhammad who was taken prisoner after the battle of Bedr. Yezid HI. was son of Mah-Afrid, the daughter of FirCiz, and granddaughter of Yezdegird, the last king of Persia of the house of Sassan. After a troublous reign of four months, he died of the plague. For a short time his brother Ibrahim filled the vacant throne; but he abdicated in favour of his war like relative Marwan II., 1 who assumed the Khalifate in 744. Soon after his accession to power, the Abbasides, who had long been intriguing secretly, rose in re bellion, in the persons of the brothers 'Abdallah-Abu'l- 'AbMs, es-Saffah and Abu-Ja'afar, el-Mansur. Mar- wiln was warned of the danger, by a sage named Nasr-ibn-Sayyiir, who said to him,' Among the cold ashes I can discern small sparks. I fear lest they should burst into open flames.' At first the sedition on the banks of the Euphrates appears to have caused the Khalifah little alarm. He trusted to be able to quell it with ease, for he had formerly reaped a harvest 1 He had been Governor of Azerbaijan.THE KHALtFAHS. 1X9 of glory, during a brilliant campaign in Georgia; and was surnamed i the (warlike) ass of Mesopotamia. 1 The rebellion of the Abbasides, however, soon became too formidable to be despised. 2 es-Saffih had been proclaimed Khalifah at el-K6fah, and had collected a large army, chiefly from the provinces of Persia. Marwan II. advanced against him, and the hostile forces encountered each other at a place called Tubar, near Mosul. 3 The Omeyyah army was entirely de feated by the rebels, and the unfortunate Khalifah fled first to Hims (Emesa), and then to Damascus ; but the gates of both these ungrateful cities were closed against him. 4 Chasing him as the hungry leopard follows the timid gazelle, es-Saffah routed the ill-fated Marw^n again, in Palestine ; 5 and finally he was defeated and killed in Egypt. His head was cut off to be embalmed and sent to es-Saffah. When his tongue was cut out, a ferret ran off with it, as a punishment from God, it was said by the Abbasides, for his blasphemous language while living. His sons, 'Obaid-Allah and'Abdallah, fled into iEthiopia, and were there murdered. 6 The Abbaside Khalifah, who had thus succeeded in his rebellion, ordered the 1 Himar- el-Jazirah : the asses of that country being, in his days, remarkable for their unparalleled fortitude and intrepidity. 2 Sulaiman-bin-Hisham rebelled at el-Bdsrah, with an army of 10,000 men. Marwan defeated him. 3 The ex-Khalifah Ibrahim fell in this battle, fighting for his suc cessor and relative Marwan II. Some say he was ^drowned in the Euphrates after the battle was over. 4 The Abbasides plundered Damascus for three days. 6 a.d . 749. 6 Marwan was a valiant and magnanimous prince, thoroughly versed in all the arts of government.

His uncle 'Abdallah invited ninety princes of that unfortunate house to a banquet, and treacherously butchered them. Many more were murdered at el-Bdsrah, and their bodies were left exposed, to be eaten by dogs and vultures. Not content with these cruel massacres, es-Saffah dis turbed the repose of the dead. He caused the bodies of the Khalifahs Mu'awiyab L, Yezid I, Abdu'l-Malik, and Hisham, to be dug up, and burnt, and their ashes to be scattered to the winds. Thus ended the dynasty of the Omeyyah Ehalifalis of the East. 1 For a period of eighty years they had reigned over an enormous empire; and though some of them had been profligate tyrants, the majority had been remarkable either for the encouragement of architecture, poetry, and the arts of peace, or for the splendour of their warlike achievements. In fact, the period of their rule was the most brilliant in Muslim firm ills ; and, on the death of Marwan II., the Abbaside Khalifahs found themselves in possession of the largest empire in the world. A more glorious fate still awaited the house of Omeyyah. Though its hope seemed utterly extin guished by the overthrow of Marwan IL, and it was well nigh annihilated by the cruel policy of the Abba- sides, one youth of that noble family escaped the general massacre. He it was who was destined to raise his house, phoenix-like, from its ashes, and to found another dynasty of the Benu-Omeyyahs in Spain, 1 jud, 661-745.THE KHALlFAHS. 121 whose splendid career of 250,' years forms one of the most striking periods in the early history of Europe. Abu'l-'Abbas, es-Safiah, the first Abbaside Khalifah, died in 753; and was succeeded by his brother Abu- Ja'afar, el-Mansftr, who founded the city of BaghdM on the Tigris, 15 miles above the ancient Persian capital of Ctesiphon, and established the seat of his government there. In his reign a final and despe rate attempt was made by the Persians in KhurHs&amp;n to regain their liberty; but it was crushed by the armies of the Khalifah, and hope gave way to despair in the hearts of the fire-worshippers. El-Mansur died in 775, and was succeeded by his son el-Malidy, in whose time a new and formidable sect of fanatics arose in Persia. One H4kim-bin-Hashim of Maru (Merv), who had formerly been secretary to the governor of Kliurasan, gave himself out as a prophet, in the country beyond the Oxus (called by the Arabs Ma-wara-'n-Nahr). He is generally known as el-Muhdnn but was also called by the Persians el-Bourkdy, ' the Veiled,' because he covered his face with a gilded mask to hide his de formity, having lost an eye in battle, and being other wise very ugly; though his followers said he did it, lest the splendour of his countenance should dazzle the eyes of the beholders. Many proselytes flocked to his standard from Kash and Samarkand, and he retained them in their delusion by performing seeming miracles, one of which was to make a moon rise out of a well for many days together. This gave him the name of S the Moon- maker,' in Persia.122 * HISTORY OF PERSIA. On the approach of the Khalifah's army, he retired into one of his strongest fortresses ; and, when all hope was gone, he poisoned the whole garrison, burnt their bodies,; and then jumped into a tub of acjua-fortis, which consumed every part of him, except his hair. The sect of el-Mukanna' continued to exist, beyond the Oxus for 500 years, waiting for a grey-headed man riding on a greyish beast, the individual whom el-Mu kanna' foretold would be the next Prophet. 1 The el-Mahdy was profuse and extravagant; and it is recorded that when he went on a pilgrimage to Mekkah, he was followed by camels laden with snow, in which the most delicious fruits were cooled, to refresh him in the burning Arabian deserts. He was tall, handsome, and very swarthy. His eldest son, Musa, el-Hady, succeeded him in 785; but he died the next year, and was followed by his brother Harun. Harun, er-Eashid, the hero of the rabian was the most illustrious of the Abbaside Khalifahs. He was about twenty-two years of age at the time of his accession, and had already distinguished himself in his wars with the Grecian emperors. In his reign the Khalifate reached the height of its prosperity. Baghdad became the most flourishing city in the East; and the rich products of China and India were brought by Arabian merchants to the port of el-Basrah, and thence up the Tigris to the capital. 1 Moore, in his Veiled Prophet follows the his torical account, given by Sale, very faithfully. Azim is his only imaginary character.THE KHALlFAHS. 123 The internal laws and regulations of Ilarun were an improvement on the meagre rules of Muhammad. The Kurdn, indeed, had soon been found quite insufficient as a code of laws ; and all the sayings and traditions of the Prophet were collected from his wives and companions. This collection was termed and was regarded by the orthodox as of equal authority with the Kuran. But many parts of the Kuran and the Sunnah were obscure and figurative ; and several divines devoted themselves to the explanation of the sacred text. The four most eminent of these were Malik-bin-'Anas; Muhammad-bin-Idris,esh-Shafa'iy; Ahmed-bin-Hanbal; and Abu-Hanifah ; who have since been canonised as the four Imams of the orthodox Muslims, and whose followers are known respectively as Malikis, SMfa'is, Hanbalis and Hanafis. The followers of Abu-Hanifah were chiefly guided by their own judgment, while the three other schools adhered more tenaciously to the letter of the sacred writings. Abu-Hanifah was brought into great credit by Abu-Yusuf, the chief justice to Hlrfoi, er-Eashid. The memory of the great Khalifah is stained by the unjust execution of his faithful wazlr, his comrade in all the strange adventures which are recorded in the bian Nights, the famous Ja'afar, el-Barmaky, or the Bar mecide. 1 This took place in 802.

' It is rare to read the Barmak was introduced to the Khalifali Abdu'l-Mdlik. The Kha- lifah had two jewels, which betrayed the vicinity of poison by rub bing together. On the approach of Bdrmak he was thus led to suspect he carried poison. Barmak acknowledged the fact, and explained that it was the custom of all Ghebres of rank to carry with them this means of escaping from their enemies. He gradually rose in the Khalifah's favour, and was promoted to high rank. His son Khalid publicly embraced Islam. Khalid's son Yahya, the trusted councillor and tutor of HMn, had four sons, one of whom was Ja'afar; and they held the foremost places in the court and camp of their master, with whom their in fluence was, for a long time, unbounded. Harftn had an extraordinary attachment for Ja'afar the Barme cide, and could not bear him out of his sight. The Khalifah also loved his sister Abb§&gt;sah, who was a woman of extraordinary charms and beauty, with extreme affection. Harun proposed that Ja'afar should marry Abbasah, on condition that he should never see her, except in the Khalifah's presence, so that all three might constantly be toge ther without impropriety. Ja'afar long resisted. 4 How should I,'he said, 4 the son of a Ghebre, be allied to the family of H^shim?' When his father Yahya, his brother Fadhl, and his other brothers, heard the proposal, they too were filled with sorrow. At length Ja'afar consented; but he forgot the cruel and absurd commands of the Khalifah, and Abbasah became a mother. This was told to Harftn by a slave of his favourite wife Zubaidah. The tyrant was furious. Ja'afar was put to death under circum stances of diabolical treachery by his unworthy master—enough a hundred times to overbalance all the glory that has ever been as cribed to him. Yahy^, and his other sons, were cast into prison, where the former died, and the latter were murdered. Abbasah was condemned to be buried alive. Numberless tales are told of the munificent generosity, the for giving temper, and other noble qualities of the ill-fated Barmecides. It is a satisfaction to think that the tyrant H&amp;rftn, er-Rashid, suffered from the pangs of remorse to his dying day.THE KHALtFAHS. 125 history of an Eastern sovereign, unstained by atrocious crimes. Deeds of blood, wrought through unbridled passion, are ill redeemed by ceremonious devotion, and acts of trifling, perhaps ostentatious humility.' 1 In 807, Harun, er-Eashid, marched to Khurasan to oppose a rebellious lieutenant, but was taken ill and died on the road, and was buried at Tfts (the modem Mash-had), in 808. His son and successor, el-Mamfin, was a great patron of literature. 2 He ordered many Grecian works on science to be translated; and several, which have been lost in the original, were preserved in the Arabic trans lations. 3 Aristotle, Elato, Euclid, Etolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen were studied in the colleges of Baghdad; and the astronomers 4 of the Khalifah el-Mam fin accurately 1 Gibbon. 2 el-Mamfin filled all his offices with Persians, and married Buran, the daughter of his Persian wazir. In his time lived Abu-Nuwas, the poet. 1 Love and wine were the two stars which guided the life of this poet;' and he scorned Muslim bigotry. AJu-JVuwds, t Father of Hair/ from his long flowing locks, was born in a.d . 767, in a village of Khuzistan. When eight years old he came with his mother to el-Basrah, and thence with a poet named Wahib-bin-el- HuMb, to el-KHfah, where he was instructed in poetry. Abu- Nuw&amp;3 died a.d. 815. He was intimate with Hariln and his sons. 3 el-Mam tin's teacher was a Persian named Abu'l-Hdsan 'Aly-ibn- Hdmzah Bdhman-ibn-Abdallah-ibn-Firfiz, surnamed el-Kassai, a Persian, and an excellent grammarian. He died at er-Ray (Rhe) in 811. 4 The Arabs, under the Khalifah el-Mamfin, began to apply them selves to astronomy, in about a.d. 813. Under this prince lived one Habash, who composed three sorts of astronomical tables. The Arabs followed the system of Ptolemy, translated his Syntaxis, and made it their sole study.

The court and capital of el-Mu'tdsam are described in glowing terms by Abulfeda: ' Barges and boats, with the most superb decorations, were swimming on the Tigris; while the palace con tained 12,500 pieces of silk tapestry, embroidered with gold, and magnificent furniture, amongst which was a tree of gold and silver, with eighteen large branches, on which sat a variety of birds of the same precious metal.' El-Mu'tasam was succeeded in 842 by his son el- Wathik b' Illah, who was followed in 847 by his brother el-Mutawdkkal, a cruel tyrant, who increased the number of his Turkish guard. But they proved more dangerous to the Khalifah than to his subjects, for in 861 they cut him into seven pieces, and placed his son Muntasir on the throne. For a long time this licentious Praetorian guard murdered or enthroned the wretched Khalifahs at their pleasure. Sunk in the lap of sloth, the Abbasides en tirely lost the warlike virtues of their ancestors ; Spain, Africa, Egypt, Persia, and Syria were, one by one, torn from their grasp ; independent princes rose up in the distant provinces of the empire; and the Commanders of the Faithful became contemptible puppets in the hands of ambitious chiefs. In 940, the Khalifah er-PiMhy b' Illah 1 ascended the throne.

T he Arabs had soon overrun all Persia; a great por tion of the people adopted the new faith, others fled into the fastnesses of Yezd and Kirman, there to wor ship in peace, according to the religion of their fathers; but for nearly two centuries the Khalifahs of Damascus and BaghdM held undisputed possession of Iran, and its provinces were governed by their lieutenants. As the vigour of the Khalifate began to pass away, and effeminate luxury crept imperceptibly into the palaces of Baghdad, the distant heutenants gradually aspired to independence. At length, in 868 a.d., one Ya'kub-bin-Lais, the son of a brasier in Sistan, rose in rebellion, subdued Balkh, Kabul, and Pars, but died on his march to BaghdM. In former days he would have been treated as an audacious rebel against the authority of the Vicar of God; now the degenerate Ehalifah appointed his brother Amr his lieutenant on the death of Ya'kub, 1 and allowed him to govern Pars, as the founder of the Safidry, or Brasier, dynasty. 1 a.d . 877.132 HISTORY OF PEESIA. Ever fearful of the power of 'Amr, the Khalifah at length instigated a Tatar lord, named Isma'il Samany, to raise an army against the Saffaris, in Khurasan. 'Amr marched against him, and crossed the Oxus, but he was entirely defeated; and laughed heartily at a dog, who ran away with the little pot that was pre paring the humble meal of the fallen king. That morning it had taken thirty camels to carry his kitchen retinue. 'Amr was sent to Baghdad, and put to death in 901 A.D. Isma'il, who traced his descent from a Persian noble who had rebelled against Khusru Parviz, now founded the SamUny dynasty, which ruled over KhurMn and the north of Persia, with their capital at Bukhara. The Dailamy dynasty ruled in Pars and the south of Persia during the same period. To the Samanians Persia owes the restoration of its nationality, which had been oppressed and trodden under foot by the Arabian conquerors. Persia had, from the most ancient times, possessed a national ballad literature, and, as has been before stated, the Fables of Pilpay (or Bidpay) were translated from the Sanskrit as early as the days of Anushirwan ; but the forcible change of religion, and the persecution by the Muslims of everything savouring of fire worship, had, during two weary centuries, almost destroyed the national literature and national feeling of Iran. Under the fostering patronage of the Samanian kings both were once more warmed into life. Isma'il Samany was succeeded in 907 by his braveSAMANIAN DYNASTY. 133 and generous son, Ahmed, whose grandson Nasr con quered Eay (Ehe), Isfahan, and Kom. He was the munificent patron of the Persian poet, Eudiky; who, though born blind, wrote the most beautiful poetry. The king gave him a splendid estabhshment of 200 slaves and 400 camels, and treated him with great distinction. Eudiky's most famous poem is called the some verses of which have been translated into English, and are printed in Malcolm's He who my brimming cup shall view In trembling radiance shine, Shall own the liquid ruby's hue Is matched by rosy wine. Each is a gem from Nature's hand, In living lustre bright, But one congeals its radiance bland, One swims in liquid light. Ere you can touch, its sparkling dye Has left a splendid stain; Ere you can drink, the essence high Floats giddy through the brain. Nasr died at Bukhara in 943, leaving all his terri tories in peace. His son, Amir-Nuh, passed his life in a series of petty wars, and his grandson, 'Abdu-'l-Mdlik, was killed by a fall from his horse, when playing at ball. He was succeeded in 961 by his brother Mansur. This king was a distinguished patron of the national literature of Ir4n. He caused a collection of all the old traditions to be made in prose, which was called the Bustan-Nameh, or' Garden Book.' Afterwards the poet Eukiky was ordered to turn it into verse, but he134 HISTORY OF PERSIA. was murdered before he had completed a thousand hues. The great work was left to the more fortunate genius of Firdausy. In 975, Mansur was succeeded by his son 'Abdu-'l- Kasim-Nuh, who was obliged to seek aid against Lis rebellious subjects from Sabuktagin, a chief in Gkiz- ni. The rebels were defeated, and the allies received honors and rewards; but in 998, Mahmud, the son of Sabuktagin, dethroned the last king of the Sama- nian dynasty. During the reign of 'Abdu-'l-KMm-Mh, Ibn-Sina, commonly called Avicenna, the great Persian physician and philosopher, was born at a village near BukMra, in 980. He studied Euclid and logic ; and when he was about eighteen turned his attention to medicine, in which study he gained such proficiency that he cured the Samanian king Nuh of a dangerous illness, about two years afterwards. When the Samanian dynasty fell, Avicenna retired to Isfahan, where he wrote numerous works on medi cine and mathematics. One called the Kamn was long, even in Europe, a standard work on medicine. The great physician died at Hamadan, in the year 1036. 1 While the Samanians reigned in Khurasan and Bukhara, the Dailamy or el-Buyah dynasty estab lished their rule over Ears and 'Irak. 1 Avicenna says that his father sent him to an herb-merchant to learn the Arabian arithmetical figures, and this is the earliest men tion of them.—Abnlfaragins, His p. 349.

In 977 Asadu-'d-Daulah, grandson of the fisherman, began to reign. He restored the sacred buildings at Kerbela, built hospitals for the poor at Baghdad, and made a famous dyke over the river Kur, nearPersepolis, which (under the name of still fertilizes the country.

The rise of the el-Ghaznah dynasty was almost as rapid and extraordinary as that of the Dailamis. Abastagin, a nobleman of Bukhara, fled from the resentment of the Samanian king Mansur, and estab lished himself at Ghaznah. After his death, in 976, his son Is hak was put aside, and a Turkish slave named Sabuktagin, assumed the government of the petty principality. Under his rule Ghaznah attained great prosperity ; and at his death his son, the famous Con queror Mahmud succeeded him, a . T ). 997. MahmM devoted his whole life to the slaughter of his fellow-men, under the pretext of spreading the faith of Islam. In 1001 he conquered the Panjab; and, during subsequent years, he advanced into India, destroying the temples and idols, and slaughtering the people. 1 In 1014 he conquered Kashmir and Mirut, 1 In 1004 he conquered Multan. In 1008 the Rajahs of Ujain, Gwalior, Kanfij, Dehli, and Ajmir, with their united forces, advanceEL-GHAZNAH DYNASTY. 137 and in 1018 he captured Muttra, a sacred city of the Hindus. All the idols were demolished, 458,333/. worth of plunder and 53,000 captives were sent to Ghdznah, and a cruel massacre was perpetrated on the Hindus. Sir John Malcolm contrasts these atrocities of the first Muslim conqueror of Muttra, with the conduct of the first Englishman who occupied the sacred city—Lord Lake, in 1803. The latter protected and respected the persons and property of the inhabitants, and ordered his army not to slaughter cattle, as their doing so would be deemed a sacrilege by the people. ' The power of the monarch of Ghaznah,' he adds, ' soon passed away; that of the English will remain as long as they have the firmness and virtue to pre serve those principles of wisdom, toleration, and justice, upon which it is established.' In 1023 Mahmud was foiled in an attempt to reduce the strong Hindu fortress of Gwalior; but in the following year he again invaded India, took the city of Gujrat, after a siege in which the carnage was fearful, and destroyed the famous idol of Sftmnath. The sandal-wood gates of the temple were conveyed to Ghaznah. In 1027 the conqueror overran 'Ir&amp;k as far as the city of er-Eay, but in 1028 he died in the ' Palace of Felicity ' at Ghaznah.

Lord Ellen- borough's order was carried into effect by General Notts army, on September 8,1842 ; but the shrine was not otherwise profaned. The gates were forwarded from the Sutlej to Gujrat; and ' the insult of 800 years was avenged.' Mahmud 1 of Ghaznah was a mere vulgar con queror, and his only real title to fame is that a great and immortal poet lived at his court. The poet Firdausy 2 was born at Tus (the modem Mash-had), in KhurMn, in about the year 940 a.d. He was employed by MahmM of Ghaznah to write the history of Persia in verse, and the extensive materials collected by the Samanian king, and left unfinished by Eukiky, were placed in his hands. For thirty years he continued to labour on this grateful task. He dearly loved the ancient glory of Iriln, and he ever dwelt on the religion of Zoroaster with peculiar fondness. Through deserts, and over mountains, the old sage journeyed, diligently collecting 1 The title of Sultan is said to have been first invented for Mali- in (id by ambassadors from the Khalifahs of Baghdad. It is an Arabic or Chaldaic word, which signifies * lord' and ' master.' But Mr. Thomas has shown that the title occurs on coins earlier than the time of MahmM. 2 ' The Life of Firdansy,' by Daulat-SMh, es-Samarkandy, written in 1487, is reviewed in the Asiatic vol. xxvii. p. 529.

It con tains a full and complete national history of Persia, from the first Paishdadian king to the death of Yezdegird. 1 His descriptions of scenery are exquisite, and some 1 Atkinson, in his translation of the ShdJi-Ndmeh says:— 4 The Shah-Nameh is history in rhyme. It was gathered from the tales and legends of ages, traditionally known throughout the country. His language is comparatively simple, and possesses a portion of the energy and grace of our own poets. In epic grandeur he is above all; his verse is exquisitely smooth and flowing; and he is perhaps the sweetest, as well as the most sublime poet of Persia. He is besides one of the easiest to be understood. His verse is uniformly the same, consisting of eleven syllables. Speaking of the attributes of God, Firdausy says: By Him above the soul is weighed; by Him— But, oh! the spirit staggers faint and dim. Can all that reason, life, and language sways Pourtray creation's Lord, and speak His praise? Restrain thy vain presumption ; rest content To know He is; all speech were idly spent. Though others faint—though erring nature stray, Recall thy Maker's mandate, and obey! On the creation of man he says : Know then thy power, 0 man ! by Heaven designe The chief—the centre—of created kind. View the fair world, with every power endued, And own, oh, blest one! all things work thy good, Thy place, thy powers, the past, thy future's store ; Then, if thou canst, be sluggish to adore. But constant pangs, thou sayst, thy steps attend. Yet e'en these ills to thy perfection tend; They wake thy mind to acts that life endear, They teach thee oft, to shun the cause of fear. Wouldst thou maintain the freedom of the soul ? Disdain the frailer body's base control. Firm in thy Maker's love, that soul shall shield Thy heart 'gainst all that either world can yield.HISTOEY OF PERSIA. of the historical episodes, especially that of TMstam and Zohrab, possess the highest poetic excellence. When the poet's long labours were at length crowned with success, Mahmud refused to give him the stipulated reward. 1 Firdausy wrote a bitter satire on the penurious tyrant, 2 for which he was sentenced to be trampled to death by an elephant; but he escaped, and wandered about for many years, ever flying from the persecution of Mahmud. He died in his native town of Tus, in the year 1021, at a good old age. Firdausy wrote in the Pehlvi language, and carefully excluded all Arabic words and idioms. 3 When it was too late, the tyrant Mahmud repented of his injustice to the glorious old poet, and sent him an immense sum of money. But the aged Firdausy was already beyond the reach either of the favour or the persecution of the capricious conqueror, who had formerly sought to put him to a cruel death. The rich present reached the gates of Tus as the body of the poet was on its road to the grave; ' and it was rejected by his virtuous daughter, who scorned to 1 Several passages from tlie Shdh-Ndmeh will be found in previous chapters.

The Turkish tribes which wandered from pasture to pasture, on the eastern shores of the Caspian, were composed of hardy and warlike men, capable of en during great fatigue, and devoted to their leaders. Every male in the tribe was a brave and robust soldier, 1 Malcolm's Persia. Elphinstone {India, p. 566) says that Fir- dausy's daughter was at length persuaded to accept Mahmfid's gift, and laid it out on an embankment to afford a supply of water to her father's beloved native city of Tus. 2 EL-GHiZNAH DYNASTY.

They were in a condition of constant war; so that when these formidable elements were united into a vast army, by the genius of some great chief, their invasion was irresistible. Such a man was Tugrul-Beg. His grandfather, Saljuk, was a chief of considerable reputation, said to have been thirty-fourth in lineal descent from the great Afrasidelab ; whose son, Mikhail, was honoured by Mahmud of Ghaznah; and Mas'ud of GMznah granted a province on the Jaxartes to the family of Saljuk. In 1038 an immense army of Turkish warriors, led by the grandsons of Saljuk — Tugrul and DaM- crossed the Oxus, and defeated an army sent against them from Ghaznah, at a place called Zandikan, about two days' march from Maru (Merv). From that time the el-GMznah dynasty lost their power, but did not wholly disappear until a.d. 1160. Tugrul then advanced into KhurMn, and assumed the title of sovereign at NisMpur, when his whole army embraced the religion of the Kuran. Leaving his brother Daud in Khurasan, he then advanced into Tr&amp;k, overthrew the el-Buyah dynasty, conquered all Persia; and, entering Baghdad as a conqueror, treated the powerless and feeble Khalifah with respect and consideration. Having subdued Mosul, and the region round Bagh dad, he invaded Georgia and defeated the Greeks in several battles. In 1062 he married the Khalifah sTHE SALJUKIAN DYNASTY. 143 daughter, but died a few months afterwards at Eud- bar, near Kazwin. 1 This most successful conqueror was succeeded in his vast dominions by his nephew Alp-Arslan, ' Con quering Lion,' the son of Daud. Another branch of his family established themselves as Sultans of Eum, in Asia Minor. 1063 A.D. The reign of Alp-Arslan is remarkable for the war in which he was engaged with the Greeks. In 1070 the Emperor Eomanus Diogenes advanced against him, and after a hard-fought battle was de feated and taken prisoner at a place called Konongo, in Azerbaijan. The Saljukian king treated his cap tive enemy with noble generosity. Alp-Arslan having asked Eomanus how he would have treated him under similar circumstances, the latter replied, ' I would have given thee many a stripe.' This insolent speech excited no anger in the generous breast of Alp-Arslan, who shortly afterwards liberated him. This king, with the able assistance of his minister, the Nizamu-'l-Mulk, ruled Persia with justice and equity.

Maru (Merv) (which was also named Jihdn, ' Seat of the King'), was the favourite residence of Alp-Arslan; and he surrounded its walls with stately palaces, groves, and gardens. 1 This good king was killed in an expedition beyond the Oxus ; and with his last words he besought his son to profit by the wisdom of the great minister, Nizamu-'l-Mulk. He was buried at Maru, and the following epitaph was placed on his tomb: ' All you who have seen the glory of Alp- Arslan exalted to the heavens, come to Maru, and you will behold it buried in the dust.' 1073 a.d . Mdlik-SMh succeeded his father, and continued Nizamu-'l-Mulk as his minister. In 1077 his generals conquered Syria and Egypt, Bukhara and Samarkand ; so that his empire was as vast as that of the Sassanian kings in the height of their glory. He encouraged the cultivation of science and lite rature, and his reign is famous for the reformation of the Calendar. 2 An assembly of all the astronomers of Persia adopted a system of computing time which Gibbon says, ' surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian air a.'

The Nizim was the first victim of the extraordinary and horrible sect of Assassins. Their founder, Hdsan-Sdbah (Hasan, es-SabMh), was sent by his father to Mshapur, to study under the Tmflrn el-Muwaffak.

Nizanm-'l-Mulk left a Wasiyyah, or ' Testament,' which he wrote as a memorial for future statesmen.— Calcutta Review, No. 59, given in Mirkhund's History of the Assassins, The Niz^m says: ^ One of the greatest of the wise men of Khurasan was the Imam el-Muwaffak, of Nishapur; and my father sent me from et-Tus to Nishapur that I might study under the guidance of that illus trious teacher. I found two other pupils of my own age. Hakim 'Omar, el- Khayyam, and the ill-fated Bin-Sabbah, and we three formed a close friendship together. We made a vow that to whomsoever of us a for tune should fall, he should share it equally with the other two. Years rolled on: I went to Transoxiana, wandered to Ghaznah and Kabul; and, when I returned, eventually rose to be administrator of affairs during the sultanate of Alp-Arslan.' Both his schoolfellows found him out, and claimed the performance of the school vow. The wazir kept his word. Hasan received a place in the government, but intrigued against his benefactor, and was disgraced. 'Omar, el-Khayyam, asked for retirement, and for opportunities, to spread wide the advantages of science. He received a pension, and resided at NisMpiir.

From IsfaMn he went to Cairo, the capital of the FAtimite Khalifahs, thence by sea from Damietta to Tripoli, and by Baghdfid to Persia again. He now conceived the idea of forming a new sect, whose power should be established by secret murders.

He was called Jebel ' Mountain Chief,' which the Crusaders corrupted into ' the Old Man of the Mountain :' and a colony of his sect was established in Lebanon. The daggers of his emissaries were felt both in the East and West. The Nizam, his former enemy, was his first victim ; and Malik -Shah died, with suspicion of poison, the same year. _ On his death there were a succession of civil wars; but in 1126 his son SUnjar subjugated all Persia. This king was leading an army against the Assassins, when one morning he found a dagger stuck into his pillow, close to his head. The warning was sufficient, and he hastily retreated. The early part of S^njar's reign was very prosperous. He always resided in Khurasan; but he conquered all the country between the Oxus and Jaxartes, making one of his nobles governor of Samarkand, and his cup- bearer ruler of Kliuwarizm. But late in life Sanjar was defeated by the Turk mans, and when he returned mournfully to Khurasan, a poet reminded him that 4 the condition of God alone is not liable to change.' He was afterwards taken prisoner by the Turkmans of the tribe of the el- Ghuzzah, in 1153, 1 and suffered a long captivity. His wife, the SuMnah KMtun.TurMn, acted as regent m KhurMn; but the country was overrun by tribes o 1 A barbarous tribe, who paid an annual tribute of 24,000 g to the Persian monarch.SALJUKIAN DYNASTY. 149 savage Turkmans, who committed endless atrocities on the wretched people. It was then that the poet Anwary, a native of et-Ti\s and the countryman of Firdausy (Perdosi), addressed a long and piteous poem to the Governor of Samarkand, imploring his aid, and describing the miseries of the country. It is called the ; Tears of Khurasan' 1 The following two verses depict the horrors which sur rounded him, as he wrote: Is there (where ruin reigns in dreadful state) Whom fortune smiles on, or whom joys await ? 'Tis yonder corpse descending to the tomb. Is there a spotless female to be found Where deeds of diabolic lust abound ? 'Tis yonder infant issuing from the womb. The mosque no more admits the pious race, Constrained, they yield to beasts the holy place. A stable now, where dome nor porch is found. Nor can the savage foe proclaim his reign, For Khorasania's criers all are slain. And all her pulpits levelled with the ground. Sanjar at length effected his escape, but he died in 1157, aged 73. The last Saljuldan king was Sanjar's great-nephew, Togrul III., in whose reign, Tokush, the ruler of Khuwarizm, invaded Persia with a great army. Togrul, who was addicted to all kinds of excesses, went into battle very drunk, and advanced against the enemy, 1 The whole is translated by Captain William Kirkpatrick, in the A siatic Miscellany, p. 287.

This took place in the year 1193. 2 On the fall of the Saljukians, Persia was divided amongst several petty princes. The king of Khuwarizm held Khur^s&amp;n. 3 The Assassins 4 continued their power on the south-east borders of the Caspian for 160 years. The rest of Persia was divided amongst the petty sovereigns called Ata-hegs. The son of a Turkish slave was wazir to Togrul III. the last Saljukian king, and died in 1185. He founded a dynasty of At&amp;-b6gs in Azerbaijan, which lasted until 1225. 1 This is D'Herbelot's version. Sir William Jones translates it thus: i When dust arose from the numerous army, the cheeks of our name possessing (heroes) turned pale; I raised this mace a single stroke ; I left the foot soldiery in that place. My steed raged like an elephant, and the ground became agitated like the river Nile/— Persian Grammar. Sir W.

The nephew of Muzhaffaru-'d-Din, named Sa'ad, ruled in Shiraz in 1194. He surrounded the town with a wall, and built the Masjadi-Jama'a, or Chief Mosque, which still remains. His son, A.bu-Bekr, succeeded hiin in 1226. Abu -Bekr-ibn-Sa'ad extended his dominion over the pearl fisheries at el-Bahrein, and over all the islands in the Persian Gulf. By conciliating the great Mongol conqueror, Jingiz-KMn, he saved Fars from de struction. He died at Shiraz, in 1259. During his reign, the famous Persian poet, Sa'ady, KINGS OF KHUWAHIZM.

A merchant of Aleppo recognized him, and paid his ransom. The great poet passed the last thirty years of his life in his native and beloved ShMz. 2 Between the town of ShMz and the northern hills there are deli cious gardens, with the rivulet of EuknaMd rippling through them, and the lofty domes of the mosques are seen afar through the groves of trees. The climate is delicious. 1 Persian poetry : A KM . never has less than two couplets, the two last lines of each distich rhyming. KMdsnawy. Both lines of the distich rhyme together.

The city was much im proved by the el-Biiyah Princes and the Ati-begs; and in more modern times by Kerim-Khan-Zend.154 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Here Sa'ady composed his two famous poems—the Gulistdn, or 'Bed of Eoses,' and the or ' Garden'; the one consisting of stories in prose, inter spersed with couplets, verses, and moral apologues in verse; the other entirely in verse. The is still one of the most popular poems in Persia. It is a noble work, in which the greatness and goodness of God are praised, and the vanity of all worldly pursuits constantly set forth. He says: The world, my brother, will abide by none, By the world's Maker let thy heart be won. Eely not, nor repose on this world's gain, For many a son, like thee, she has reared and slain. What matters when the spirit seeks to fly. If on a throne, or on bare earth we die? Again: Sa'ady, move thou to resignation's shrine, O man of God ! the path of God be thine. Hapless is he who from this haven turns. All doors shall spurn him who this portal spurns. His independence of mind, and hatred of tyranny, are here expressed: Flames cannot with such speed wild rue consume, As tyrants perish by the wronged heart's fume. To sharp-toothed tigers kind to be, To harmless flocks is tyranny. Ihey tliat with raging elephants make war, Are not, so deem the wise, the truly brave. But, in real verity, the valiant are Those who when angered are not passion s slave. Better renounce the favour of the great, Than meet their porters 7 gibes at thy expense. Better through want of food succumb to fate. Than bear the butcher's dunning insolence. Nevertheless Sa'ady is unbounded in his praise of Abu-Bekr -bin-Sa'ad-bin-Zangy, the ruling sovereignTHE POET SA'ADY. 155 of Shinlz. We must therefore hope that he really deserved it. The poet's generosity is expressed in this couplet: The man of God, with half a loaf content, To dervishes the remnant will present: and was more practically proved when, having been presented with 50,000 dinars by Hiil4k(i-Khan, he expended it in erecting a house for travellers, near Shir&amp;z. He had little faith in the benefits of education and competitive examinations in themselves, relying rather on the natural excellencies and talents of individual character. He says: Who can from faulty iron good swords frame ? Teaching, O Sage ! lends not the worthless worth. The rain, whose bounteous nature's still the same, Gives flowers in gardens, thorns in salt lands birth. And: Although a gem be cast away And lie obscure in heaps of clay. It's precious worth is still the same. Although vile dust be whirled to heaven. To such no dignity is given— Still base as when from earth it came. The GulistAn is full of wise proverbial sayings, and of the praise of virtue and contentment: Contentment do thou me enrich, for those Who have thee, are blessed with wealth in vain. Wise Lukman 1 for his treasure patience chose; Who have not patience wisdom ne'er attain : 1 LukmAu was a famous Arabian fabulist, supposed to have lived in the time of King David. His Fables were translated into Latin, by Erpenius, at Amsterdam.' ■ ■ If 1 i li M 156 HISTORY OF PERSIA. I . j II i li ilii \ and the following verses exemplify his wisdom and prudence: Better be silent, than thy purpose tell To others, and enjoin to secrecy. O dolt! keep back the waters at the well. For the swoll'n stream to stop, thoul't vainly try. In private utter not a single word Which thou in public would'st regret were heard. Know'st thou what Zal to valiant Rustam said ? Deem not thy foeman weak without resource. Full many a riU, from tiny springlet fed. Sweeps off the camel in its onward course. Upon the sea, 'tis true, is boundless gain; Would'st thou be safe, upon the shore remain. Sa'ady was not happy in either of his marriages, especially in the first, when he was obliged to wed the ill-tempered daughter of the Aleppo merchant, who released him from the ditch at Tripoh. Yet the following couplet is very beautiful: Better to live in chains with those we love. Than with the strange,- 'mid flow'rets gay to move. And he wrote an exquisite love song, in which the most tender affection is blended with refined and delicate feeling: Tell me, gentle traveller, thou Who hast wandered far and wide,- „ Seen the sweetest roses blow And the brightest rivers glide, Say, of all thy eyes have seen. Which the fairest land has been ? Lady ! shall I tell thee where Nature seems most blest and fair, Far above all climes beside ? 'Tis where those we love abide. And that little spot is best Which the lov'd one's foot has pressed. U 1the poet jalalu-'d-dtn kumy. 157 Though it be a fairy space, Wide and spreading is the place; Though 'twere but a barren mound, 'Twould become enchanted ground. With thee yon sandy waste would seem The margin of Al-Kawthar's stream. And thou can'st make a dungeon's gloom A bower, where new-born roses bloom. But, considering Ms religion and the time in which he lived, Sa'ady's tolerance and good-will to all mankind, without distinction of creed, is the most admirable part of his character. Mercy and charity are not restricted by him to true believers : All Adam's race are members of one frame; Since all, at first, from the same essence came: When by hard fortune one limb is oppressed. The other members lose their wonted rest. If thou feel's not for other's misery, A son of Adam is no name for thee. Saady died at a good old age in the year 1275 a.d., and was buried near Shir&amp;z. In modern times the Wakil, Kerim-Khan-Zend, erected a tomb over his remains, and endowed it with gardens and lands for the support of dervishes to watch over it. 1 JaMIu-'d-JDln Eumy, the contemporary of Sa'ady, was born at Balkh in the beginning of the thirteenth century, and passed the whole of his life as a Sufy philosopher. His Mdsnawy is a long poem, written in the form of apologues, with digressions on Siify doctrine; and he 1 The extracts from Sa'ady's poems are taken chiefly from Mr. Eastwick's translation of the Gulistdn, Two of them from Miss Costello's Rose Garden.history of persia. also wrote a collection of mystical odes. The following is an example : 2 Seeks thy spirit to be gifted With a deathless life ? Let it seek to be uplifted O'er earth's storm and strife. Spurn its joys—its ties dissever, Hopes and fears divest; Thus aspire to live for ever— Be for ever blest! Faith and doubt leave far behind thee, Cease to love or hate ; Let not time's illusions blind thee, Thou shalt Time out-date. ANOTHEE SfrFY ODE by JALALTJ-'D-DI n EtFMY. All earthly forms, where beauty dwells enshrined, Borrow that beauty from the ethereal mind. Why grieve we when the faint reflections fade ? Their source and prototype are undecayed.

Abu-Bekr, the Ata-beg of Fars and Sa'ady's patron, died at Shiraz in 1259, leaving the government to his son Sa'ad II., who was then serving in the Mongol army under Hulakd-Khan. He died on the road to ShMz; and his infant son was placed on the throne, with his mother, named Khatun-Turkan, a beautiful lady of Yezd, as regent. The child died, and two princes of the same family followed each other in the government, but the At&amp;-b6gs of Fars ceased to reign in the year 1263 a.d. 3 1 Translated by Professor Falconer, in the of 1842. 2 Born 1207. 3 See pedigree on next page.160 HISTORY OF PERSIA, The conquests of the Mongols, who poured in irre sistible torrents from Central Asia, soon afterwards absorbed all the minor governments in Persia.

T he most terrible phenomena in the history of mankind have been those devastating floods of conquest which have burst forth from the wilds of Central Asia to spread terror and devastation over almost every country of the Old World. Attila, in the fifth century, at the same time over awed the Empire of China, and entered Imperial Eome in triumph. In the ninth, the Hungarians spread desolation to the banks of the Ehine, and at the same time burnt Eavenna on the Adriatic, and Bremen on the Baltic; and in the thirteenth, Jingiz-Khan boasted that he had slain thirteen millions of his fellow- creatures. And these terrible scourges of mankind appear not to have rushed forth in one direction, like a mountain torrent destroying everything that impedes its progress, but to have spread out on all sides, as the bursting of some mighty engine. Not only did the grandsons of Jingiz-Khan proceed in their career of conquest, from Kara-Korum to the plains of Silesia, but they also penetrated into the frozen wastes of Siberia, and founded a dynasty in mjingiz-khan. 163 the son of a Tatar chief, was born in the year 1153 a.d . In 1202, at the age of 49, he had defeated or propitiated all his enemies, and in 1205 was pro claimed, by a great assembly, Khakan or Emperor of Tartary. His capital, a vast assemblage of tents, was at Kara- Komm, in a distant part of Chinese Tartary ; and from thence he sent forth mighty armies to conquer the world. This extraordinary man, who could neither read nor write, established laws for the regulation of social life and for the chase; and adopted a religion of pure Theism. His army was divided into Tumans of 10,000 men Hazarehs „ 1,000 „ Sedehs „ 100 „ Dehehs „ 10 „ each under a Tatar officer, and they were armed with bows and arrows, swords, and iron maces. Having brought the whole of Tartary under his sway, he conquered China, while his sons, Oktai and Jagatai, were sent with a vast amy against Khuwa- rizm. The country was conquered, though bravely de fended by the king's son, Jalalu-'d-Dm ; 100,000 people were put to the sword, the rest sold as slaves, and the ill-fated king died of a broken heart, on the island of Abeshkun, in the Caspian, near Astrabad. 1 1 The elder De la Croix gives a full account of the last days of Muhammad of Khuwarizm. m 2164 history of persia. The sons of Jingiz-KMn then returned in triumph to their father ; but the brave young prince, Jalalu-'d- Din, still held out against the conquerors of his country. This opposition roused Jinglz-Khan to fury; Balkh was attacked for having harboured the fugitive prince in 1221, and, having surrendered, the people were all put to death. NisMpur shared the same fate, and a horrible massacre of all the inhabitants took place. Meanwhile, Jalalu-'d-Din, with a small army, had retreated through Sistan to Ghaznah, where he defeated the Mongol army that was sent against him. Jingiz-KMn then advanced against the intrepid prince with an overpowering force, and encountered him on the banks of the Indus. A desperate battle followed, but the soldiers of Jalalu-'d-Din fought with the river behind them, and were utterly routed. The defeated prince plunged his horse into the Indus and swam across, firing his arrows at the Mongol con queror as he went. While Jingiz-Khan professed to admire his bravery, he ordered his sons to be killed and his wives and daughters to be sold into slavery. The Mongol hordes then overran KandaMr and MuMn, Azerbaijan and 'Irak; Ears was only saved by the submission of its Ata-beg, and two Mongo generals marched round the Caspian Sea. Jing 12 ' Khan returned to Tartary in a.d . 1222, but in these terrible campaigns he lost- no less than 200,000 men. As soon as the great conqueror had retired out o Persia, the indefatigalle Jalalu-'d-Din recrossed thejingiz-kiian. 165 Indus with 4,000 followers, and passing through Shiraz and Isfahan drove the Mongols out of Tabriz. But he was defeated by them in 1226 ; and though he kept up the war in Azerbaijan for a short time longer, he was at length utterly routed, and flying into KurdistUn was killed in the house of a friend there, four years afterwards. The history of this unfortunate prince, his hair breadth escapes, his heroic perseverance, and brave resistance, forms one of the most romantic episodes in the whole range of Asiatic history. In the ranks of his army there were Turks as well as Khivans, and after his overthrow, some of the latter took service under the Saljukian SuMn of Eum, at Iconium. A Turk, named Orthogrul, was one of these ; and his son, 'Othman, seized the territory of Iconium on the death of A'la-ed-Din, the last Saljukian SuMn, and founded the Ottoman Empire. 'Othman first invaded the Grecian territory in a.d , 1299. Jingiz-KMn died in the year 1227. His son Oktai succeeded him in Tartary; and Persia was governed by lieutenants of the Khans of Kara-Korum, until the year 1253, when Mangu—-tlie fourth Khan (being son of Tuly, the son of Jingiz) sent his famous brother, HuMkfi-EMn, with a large army to govern Persia, and extend his conquests to the westward. Kublai-Khaii, another brother, was Emperor of China, and founded the Yuen dynasty ; while a cousin of this conquering family, Batu, overran Muscovy and Hungary, and subjected the Eussians to a galling yoke, which his descendants maintained for centuries; andTHE MONGOL DYNASTY. 167 his brother Shaibany conquered Siberia, where his descendants continued to reign until the year 1594. The famous historian, Abu-l-Ghazy-Khan, king of Khiva in 1643, was descended from Shaibany-Khan. In 1253 Hulaku-KMn crossed the Oxus with his beloved wife, Dukuz-KMtun, who was a Christian lady, and his eldest son Abaka. His first act was to besiege and take the stronghold of the Assassins, put their chief to death, and utterly extirpate and root out this accursed sect. Their name is alone preserved as a term of reproach and infamy. He next besieged the city of Baghdad, and, having captured it, he put the last Abbaside Khalifah to death, and that time-honoured, but now useless and powerless office ceased to exist. The Abbasides had reigned as Khalifahs at Baghdad for 530 years, but for the greater part of that time their power had been merely nominal. Mosul and the greater part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated by the Mongols. On returning from his conquest, Hulaku fixed his residence at Maraghah in Azerbaijan; which he made the capital of his dominions, and here this able Mongol prince cultivated science and the arts of peace, for the remainder of his reign. Maraghah is nine or ten miles s.e . of the great lake of Urumiyyah, situated in a valley at the extremity of a well-cultivated plain, opening on the lake. The town is well built, and encompassed by a high wall. It is surrounded by gardens and plantations, watered by canals drawn from a small river, over which there areLL jgg HISTORY OF PERSIA. two bridges erected 800 years ago. The lake of Urumiyyali is about 300 miles in circumference, and so salt that no fish can live in it, emitting a sulphureous smell. A fortress was built on an island in it to contain the treasure of the Mongol prince. Philosophers, poets, and astronomers assembled tit the court of Hulalm -Khan at Maraghah, and his friend and adviser, Nasiru-'d-Din, was the most famous as tronomer of the age. An observatory was built for him on the summit of a hill close to the city, which was levelled for the purpose; and its foundations may still be distinctly traced. Here Nasiru-'d-Din constructed the astronomical tables known as the Tables Ilkhany. ' In the observatory there was an apparatus to represent the celestial sphere, with the signs of the zodiac, the con junctions, transits and revolutions of the heavenly bodies. Through a perforation in the dome, the rays of the sun were admitted, so as to strike upon certain lines on the pavement in a way to indicate, in degrees and minutes, the altitude and declination, of that luminary during every season, and to mark the time and hour of the day throughout the year. It was further supplied with a map of the terrestrial globe, in all its climates or zones, exhibiting the several regions of the habitable world, as well as a general outline of the ocean, with its innumerable islands.' The Tables of N&amp;siru-'d-Din corrected some important errors in the former mode of adjusting the commencement of the new year. 1 1 Malcolm 's Sketches of Persia, pp. 273-4.THE MONGOL DYNASTY. 169 Hulaku-Khari died at Maraghah in the year 1264, and was interred in the same tomb with his beloved wife, Dukuz-Khatun, just outside the town. During the first years of his reign he was the lieutenant of the Tatar Khan, but on the death of his brother Mangu, he assumed independent sovereignty. HulaM retained the pure theism of his grandsire, and, though practising an enlightened tolerance both towards Christians and Muslims, he never embraced either of their religions. He was succeeded by his son Abaka-Khan. AMka was a wise, able, and prudent prince, and strove to remedy the evils caused by the conquests of his father. Baghdad, especially, partially recovered its prosperity under his rule. He encouraged learning, and the great poet Sa'ady was presented to him. The poet JaMu-'d-Din Eumy also frequented his court. His warlike achievements were confined to the expul sion of a Tatar army from Khurasan, and their defeat near Herdt He married a daughter of the Greek Emperor, Michael Palasologus, and is strongly suspected of having been himself a Christian. It is certain that just before his death in 1282, he celebrated Easter Day with the Christians at Haraadan. 1 1 JyITerheht, vol. i. p. 5 (art. ' Abaka'). Not many years after Abaka's death, the Gospels were translated into Persian. A Persian manuscript version of the Four Gospels was in the possession of Dr. Pococke, and was dated a. d. 1314. It was first printed in the London Polyglot, by Bishop Walton. Another Persian version of the Gospels was edited by Pierson, at London, in a.d . 1652—7, after a collation of three manuscripts. It170 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Abaka was succeeded by his brother, who had been baptized under the name of Nicholas, whose Mongol name was Nikudar, but who became a Muslim even tually, under the name of Ahmed. In his zeal for his new faith he persecuted both Christians and Mongols, until he was threatened with vengeance by his uncle Kublai-Khan, the distant Emperor of China, and finally put to death by Argun-Khan, the son of Abaka, who succeeded him in 1284. Argun, like his father, was hostile to the Muslims, and sent embassies to the Pope and the Kings of France and England, proposing an alliance against them. A Genoese named Buscarelli was his chief agent in Europe, and in 1290 King Edward I. sent an envoy named Geoffrey de Langley to accompany Buscarelli to the court of the Mongol prince. 1 Although Edward, then engaged in the Scottish war, could not undertake another crusade, he sent Argun -Khan some ger-falcons, and ' other jewels of our land.' The famous Venetian traveller, Marco Polo, was employed to convey a Tatar bride named Kogatin, by sea, from China to Argun-Khan; but that prince died before her arrival, a.d . 1291.

He was an extravagant, dissolute prince, and his reign is chiefly famous for the first introduction of paper money. 1 He died in 1294. Ghazan, the son of Argun, then ascended the Mongol throne. He was a wise and just prince, who framed a code of edicts, reformed and regulated the administration of justice, and made roads with caravan serais at regular intervals. He carried on a war with the Sultan of Egypt, and had intercourse with several European princes. He sent an envoy to Pope Boniface VIII., and there is a letter extant from our King Edward I. to this prince, 2 but towards the end of his life he embraced the faith of 1 The first attempt to introduce paper money into circulation was made by Thai-tsu of the Sung dynasty, who ascended the throne of China a.d . 960. Marco Polo and Ibn-Batuta describe this paper money, which was called pao-tchhao (or ' precious chaus'). The Mongols of the Yuen dynasty, and their successors the Mings, issued 4 precious chaus,' but the Manchiis have never attempted it. When Kai~Katu came to the throne of Persia the finances were in great disorder. One of the revenue officers, named 'Izzu-'d-Din Muzafdar, gave the king an account of the 4 precious chaus' in China, and strongly recommended that a similar experiment should be tried in Persia. The 4 chaus' were accordingly issued at Tabriz (oblong bits of paper with the form of Muslim belief, value, &amp;c., stamped on them), and everyone was to lose his head who refused to accept the new currency. A rebellion broke out, 'Izzu-'d-Din was killed, and the Sultan ordered the 4 chaus' to be cancelled. 2 Dated a.d . 1303.

Isl^m, and erected the mosque at Tabriz, This building, both externally and internally, is covered with a mosaic of glazed bricks of very brilliant colours, and wrought into the most intricate patterns. It was destroyed by an earthquake in the beginning of the present century. Ghazan-Khan cultivated literature, and caused a Persian named Fadhl-Allah to write a History Mongols ; which is much used as an authority by the Tatar Prince, Abu-'l-Ghazy. In 1303 Ghazan died, 1 and was succeeded by his brother, Muhammad -Khudah-Bundah, who proclaimed himself of the sect of 'Aly, and removed the seat of government from Maraghah to es-Sultaniyyah. The latter city, founded by this prince, was situated in a pleasant and fertile plain about seventy miles from Kazwin, where the present Shahs of Persia often encamp in the summer. The city is now a mere mass of ruins; but the tomb of the founder, a large and handsome brick structure, with a dome, internally eighty-one feet high, is still standing. Fergusson pro nounces ' the form of this dome to be singularly grace ful and elegant. It is covered with glazed tiles, and with its general beauty of outline, the building affords one of the best specimens of this style to be found in Persia or any other country.' 2 Khudah-Bundah died in 1316, and was succeeded by 1 The Ilkhany sera dates from the reign of Ghazan.

During the minority of Abu-Sa'id, two great chiefs, named Amir-JfiMn, chief of the tribe of Selduz, and 'Amir-Husain-Kurkhan, contended for power, and JftbUn having prevailed, was married to his young sovereign's sister. On coming of age, Abu-Sa'id threw oif the yoke of Juban, who was defeated and killed in 1327. Abu-Sa'id died of a fever in 1335, and was buried by the side of his father at es-Sultaniyyah. He was the last of his race who enjoyed any power in Persia, his successors, until 1344, being mere pageants in the hands of ambitious chiefs who engaged in petty wars amongst themselves, and anarchy prevailed over Persia, paving the way for Timur's conquest. Two of Juban's sons rose to power at this time, Husain-Kurchuck and Ashraf; but the former was slain by his own wife to avenge the imprisonment of her lover, and the latter was killed in a battle with Jany-Beg, the Khan of Kipjak, in 1355. A descendant of the Ilkhany Hulaku-Khan, driven from Persia after the death of Abu-Sa'id in 1335, founded the dynasty of Ilkhanis in 'Irak-Araby, with his capital at BaghdM. This was Husain Buzury, a grandson of Argftn, who died in 1356. His grand son Ahmed passed his life in a vain attempt to check the progress of Timiir, and was at last obliged to take refuge in Egypt. He was eventually killed by Yftsuf, Chief of the Kara-Kuyunlu tribe, in 1419.

A prince of the house of the MuzhafFars was his rival. There was a place near Shiraz called Piri-sebz, where, it was said, a youth would infallibly become a great poet if he passed forty nights there without sleeping. H^fizh passed the necessary time of probation there ; and, returning by the house of his love, a lattice was thrown open, and the fair one appeared at it, declaring that she preferred a poet to a prince. The following is a specimen of one of his love songs, which was most probably written in these his days of youthful happiness : Sweet maidj if thou would st chcirin my sight, And bid these arms my neck infold; That rosy cheek, that lily hand, Would give thy poet more delight Than all Bukhara's vaunted gold, Than all the gems of Samarkand. Boy, let yon liquid ruby flow, And bid thy pensive heart be glad, What'er the frowning zealots say; Tell them their Eden cannot show A stream so clear as Ruknabad, A bower so sweet as Mosalay. 1 The literal translation, it must be confessed, is less beautiful than Sir William Jones's exquisite version : If that Turkish (maid) of Shiraz would bear my heart in her hand, For her black mole I would give Samarkand and Bukhara: Give, 0 cupbearer ! the remaining wine, for in Paradise you wi no The water-banks of Euknabad, nor the rose-beds of Mosalay.THE POET HAFIZIL 177 Go boldly forth my simple lay, Whose accents flow with artless ease, Like orient pearls at random strung : Thy notes are sweet, the damsels say, But oh, far sweeter, if they please The nymph for whom these notes are sung. 1 In old age HMzli became very religious, and was devoted to Sufy philosophy : a mode of thought which had sprung up amongst the contemplative Persians, after the fall of the beautiful religion of Zoroaster. The Sufis established their own system upon those doctrines of Muhammad which the Persians were forced to adopt; while, at the same time, they seem to have imitated the Vedanta philosophers of India in their figurative mode of expression. The Persian Sufy supposes an express contract between the assemblage of created Spirits and the Supreme, from whom they were detached. At the time of separation a celestial voice pronounced these words, 'Art thou not with God ?' (that is ' Art thou not bound by a solemn con tract with Him ?') and all the Spirits answered with one voice, ' Yes J' Hence N Art thou not ?' and JBeli, ' Yes,' incessantly occur in the mystical verses of Persian poets. The Siify ' undertakes, by a long course of edu cation and moral discipline, to lead the soul on from stage to stage, till it arrives at the goal of perfect knowledge and peace.' 2 Hafizh, one of the greatest of Safy poets, expressed his longing for a purer state 1 Translated by SirW.

His poetry is very beautiful; and the Persian lan guage in which it is written is the softest and on6 of the richest in the world.

CHAPTEE VIII. THE TlMtJEXDES. A -T the time of Timur's birth the enormous empire of his predecessor in universal conquest was rapidly falling to pieces ; and the numerous kingdoms formed by the energetic sons and grandsons of Jengiz-Khan 1 were for the most part in a state of helpless anarchy, under the nominal sway of their degenerate descendants. The last great wave of those devastating floods of conquest which, for centuries, had periodically burst forth from the wilds of central Asia, to spread terror and desola tion over the Eastern world, was rapidly subsiding. The most contemptible puppet descendants of the mighty Jengiz -Khan sat on the thrones of Persia, Samarkand, and China; while their former vassals were beginning to assert their independence in every direction.

The most famous of Timur's ancestors was Karachar Nevyan, the minister of Jagatai, and the first convert to JsMm amongst the wild conquerors. He ruled with justice and moderation for many years, and estab lished his own tribe of Barlas round the town of Kesh, near Samarkand. 2 He became Sepah Salai\ or General of Jagatai s forces, and the title was made hereditary in his family; but his great grandson, Teragay, who was Timur's father, appears to have resigned the office, preferring the retirement of Kesh, and the society of learned men, to the turbulent strife of the court of Samarkand.

His wife, Takinah EMtun, was virtuous and beautiful; and on April 8,1336, she gave birth to a son, at their encampment, near the verdant walls 2 of the delicious town of Kesh. This child was the future aspirant for universal empire. Timiiv was of the race of Turkish wanderers, and he was of noble lineage, amongst a people who thought much of their descent. His countrymen lived in tents, loved the wandering lives of warlike shepherds better than the luxury and ease of cities ; and, even in the countries which they had conquered, preferred an en campment in the open plains to a residence in the most splendid palaces. Brought up amidst such feelings, a youth of undoubted genius would naturally turn the whole force of his vigorous intellect to the achievement of military glory; but if Timur had not been a great conqueror, he would inevitably have become famous in some other way; and under any circumstances, he would have left the impress of his genius on the history of the Asiatic races. Timur was no vulgar conqueror, no ordinary man: his history, as displayed both in his own writings, and in those of his biographers, proves that, if not in his acts, certainly in his thoughts an opinions, he was in advance of his age and country. 1 Sir Thomas Browne ridicules the idea that Timto wasa corn^ mon shepherd, because his father possessed flocks an er 8- Vidgar and Common Errors^ book vii. eliap. xvi. 2 4 In spring the walls and terraces of Kesli are all green clieerful.'—Baber's Memoirs,LIFE OF TlMUR 185 When the man child was born to the chief of the tribe of Barlas, he took it, with its mother, to pay their respects to the holy Shaikh SMm&amp;u-'d-Din; 1 who was reading the 67th chapter of the Kuran, and repeating this verse,—•' Are you sure that he who dwelleth in Heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up ? and behold it shall ' The Shaikh then stopped, and said, ' We have named your son Timur.' 2 In his seventh year Timur's father took him by the hand, and led him to school, where he was placed in charge of the Mullah 'Aly Beg. The mullah having written the Arabic alphabet on a plank, placed it before the child, who was much delighted, and con sidered the study as an amusement. In his ninth year he was taught the daily service of the mosque, and always read the 91st chapter of the Kuran, called the Sun. The child very early began to entertain an innate feeling of superiority, and a sort of presentiment of his future greatness. He himself afterwards described his recollection of this feeling, in quaint terms: ' At twelve years of age,' he says, ' I fancied I perceived in myself all the signs of greatness and wisdom, and who- 1 Teragay was devoted to the society of this worthy, who was a famous pir, or religious man. 2 Timor's titles, in the height of his power, were SuMn Kamran Amir Kutbu-'d-Din Timur Kurkhan Sahib Karan.

At eighteen I became vain of my abilities, and was very fond of riding and hunting. I passed much of my time in reading the Kuran, and playing at chess, and was also very fond of horsemanship.' 1 At about this time a change came over his habits of thought; he repented of his past life, left off playing at chess, and made a vow never to injure any living creature. The future destroyer of thousands of his fellow men was seized with a feeling of tender regard for the most insignificant of God's creatures, and when the kind-hearted youth once unintentionally trod upon an ant he was so deeply grieved, that he felt as if his foot had lost all its power. Such was this young man's character when, in 1355, at the age of twenty, his father, Teragay, made over to him a number of tents, sheep, camels, and servants, and, in short, gave him a separate establishment. Then it was that his energetic mind found other work than meditations on Buddhistic vows; he began to long for some wider field of action, and to form plans of rebel lion against what he considered the tyranny of the Jagatai Sult&amp;n. He could not then find any one to join him; but another turbulent spirit, named Amir 1 Timfir's Memoirs. I believe there is no doubt as to their au thenticity. The manuscript, brought from India by Major Davy, is an octavo volume of four hundred and fifty-seven pages, in the Persian hand. It begins with Timor's birth, and ends in his forty- first year, omitting the last thirty years of his life. The manuscript was found in the library of Ja'afar, Hakim of Yemen, by Abu Ta i ul Hueaini, in the Turki language, and was translated into Persian; and into English, by Major C. Stewart, in 1830.LIFE OF TtlVrCrR. 187 Kurgan, one of the greatest chiefs of the tribe Of Jagatai, defeated and killed the tyrant, and ruled the kingdom for ten years, in the name of another puppet, named Danishmundche KMn. 1 Timur was deputed by his father to wait upon A mir Kurgan, on business connected with the tribe of Barlas; and the new ruler took a liking for the young chief, and gave him his grand-daughter in mar riage. This lady proved a faithful and loving com panion, following her lord in all his wild adventures, and sharing his dangers and misfortunes. 2 Timur now began to experience all the realities of a Turkish •chieftain's life, in the chace and in the battle-field, and his restless spirit ever thirsted for the excitement of action. He has himself recorded some of his adven tures. On one occasion he lost his way, out hunting, in a heavy snow storm. After wandering about for many hours, he reached the hut of some wandering shepherds, half dead with cold, fatigue, and hunger ; and was revived by the kindly Turks with a large supply of hot soup, of which he ate plentifully. On another day he was sent against a band of invaders from 'Irak, charged them at a gallop, and, after a few cuts, put them to flight, and took possession of their plunder. It was not, however, until 1358, when he was 1 He was not of the house of Jagatai, but was descended from Octal, another son of Jengiz-Khan. In this year (1356) Timur's mother died. He says, ' I was for some time very melancholy, and gave up my ambitious intentions. 2 Her name was Aljaz Turkhan Agha, daughter of Amir Mash- lah, granddaughter of Amir Kurgan, and sister of Amir Husain.188 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. twenty-three years of age, that Timur's ambitious views began to take a wider range than the government of his native tribe of Barlas. In that year Amir Kurgan determined to invade Khurasan, and gave the command of a thousand horse to young Timur, who was delighted with his new command. The men became exceedingly attached to him; he wrote a list of their names, and kept it folded in his pocket; and he was so elated by finding himself at the head of so many faithful followers, that he resolved, when the ruler of KhurMn was dispossessed, to grasp the sovereignty for himself. The ruler of KhurMn was expelled; and Timur was left in possession of Herat, while Amir Kurgan returned to the Oxus, where he was treacherously murdered by two Turkish chiefs. Timur was justly indignant at this base act; and, with his accustomed energy, collected his native tribe, induced several other leading men to join him, and marched to Samarkand, where the victorious chiefs divided the whole empire amongst them. Timor's ambition was now roused. Eager to assume the sovereign power, and to distance all competitors, his wisdom yet taught him the necessity of keeping on terms with the chiefs who were as powerful as himself, whilst he endeavoured to throw the ball of contention amongst them, and to rise to the head of affairs amidst the general confusion. At this time Amir Husain, the late Kurgan's grandson, and brother to Timurs wife, advanced from Kabul, and was encouraged by his relation to invade Badakshan, which he did in 1&amp;&gt;9.LIFE OF TIMtlR. 189 'This,' says Timfir, 'was the greatest error I com mitted during my whole reign ; for the man was of a vile disposition, proud and miserly, but I did not then know his character.' While the petty chiefs were thus contending for superiority, the commander of a vast army, named Tugluk Timur Khan, of the lineage of Jengiz, en camped on the banks of the Jaxartes, and summoned them all to his presence. His power was felt to be irresistible; and the chiefs selected young Timur to wait on him, and to endeavour, by his ingenuity, to prevent the country from being overrun. 1 The envoy repaired to the encampment of the invader, who gave him the command of the whole country; and the astute Timur, by his address, became sovereign of his native land, while the formidable Tugluk retired into the deserts of the East. Thus far the ambitious projects of the young chief tain had been crowned with success. He was now not only the hereditary head of the tribe of Barlas, but he had, with extraordinary ease and rapidity, obtained a prize beyond which his youthful dreams could scarcely have dared to soar. But the difficulties which surrounded his position, and the precarious tenure by which he held his power, were not disguised from himself, and he prudently deferred having el- Kiitbah read, and coin struck in his name, 2 until he 1 At this time Timor's father died, and was buried at Kesh. 2 These are the customary marks of sovereignty in the East. el-Kutbah is a prayer, offered up in the mosques for the reigning sovereign.

He appears to have been, at this time, very decisive in his operations, and quick to remove persons whom he could not trust, out of his way. He says, 'I went to assist Amir Husain, in BadaksMn, and at this time Kai Kobad, son of Kai Khusru Khutelany, who had killed the king of BadaksMn, waited on me, and began to flatter me; but as I had no confidence in him, I put him to death.' T im fir was as yet too weak to establish order amongst his unruly countrymen. Hajji Barlas, Ms own uncle, was in rebellion, and was only defeated after two days' hard fighting; other chiefs tried to inveigle Timur into their power, in order to assas sinate him ; and the heads of the villages came to him, declaring that the land of Ma-wara-'n-Nalir was desolate, and that in every district there was some tyrant, who Unjustly plundered the people. Finding it quite impossible to restore order single-handed, Timftr wrote to Tugluk Timur Khan, representing that the country was ruined, but offering, with his assistance, to make it productive. The formidable chief advanced from the deserts of the East, with a great army, to the banks of the Jaxartes. The petty chiefs either fled or submitted. Hajji Barlas escaped into Khurasan, where he was murdered by some villagers, 1 and another chief had his head cut off, for delaying to give up the gates of 1 When Timur conquered Khuras&amp;n, he punished these people, and gave their village, in perpetual to the grandson of is uncle, Hajji Barlas.LIFE OF TIMUR. 191 Samarkand. Timur, at first, received the command of all the hordes of Ma-wara-'n-Nahr, and he then naturally began to think of a pretext for inducing his formidable ally to leave the country ; but some of his proceedings created suspicion, and he was ordered to be killed. He, therefore, fled with a few followers towards Ehuwarizm, and met his brother-in-law. Amir Husain, on the road, who was also a fugitive. Timur was now to learn the bitter lessons of adversity. His misfortunes seem to have brought out some of the finest points in his character; and this time of disaster is the most interesting period in the life of the great conqueror. Although Timur and Amir Husain had only sixty followers between them, they resolved to attack the fort of Urjunj, 1 and they fought with such despera tion that only twelve of them were left, at the end of the day. Amir Husain's horse was wounded, but his wife immediately gave up hers, and was remounted on the same horse with Timor's wife. They then retreated to the top of a hill in the desert, and con tinued to fight with the enemy, until only seven men Were left. With this devoted little band, Timur at length retired, and fled across the boundless deserts. This took place in the year 1362. The region of Khuwarizm or Khiva, in which Timur had taken refuge, is 750 miles long by 600 broad; and, with the exception of the narrow tract bordering the Oxus, and the well-watered sands of Merv, it 1 Near tlie modern Khiva.HISTORY OF PERSIA. consists of a wide desert plain, without rivers or springs, woods or mountains. Between Merv and Khiva it is a broken surface of deep sand, with a small growth of underwood; 1 and it was over this cheerless waste that Timur's little party wandered, until they came, hungry and thirsty, to a well in the desert. The weary fugitives at length found rest and refreshment, the water was delicious j a shepherd gave them part of a goat, which they roasted between stones, and, as Timnr says, ' we enjoyed ourselves exceedingly.' But their future prospects were most disheartening. Aljaz Turkhan Agha, the faithful and devoted wife of Timur, cheered him up in this darkest hour of his life, and said,—' Surely our fortunes are now arrived at the lowest point.' They wandered on for days and nights, without water or bread, and remained, for a month, in a ruined deserted village. At length they fell in with a troop of wild Turkmans, under one 'Aly Beg Ghurbany, who took the fugitives prisoners, and confined Timur and his wife in a wretched cow-house, full of fleas and vermin, for more than two months. This was the lowest ebb to which his fortunes sank, and from that time the tide began to flow which bore him on to the empire of Asia. He escaped from his durance, collected twelve horsemen, whose numbers soon increased to a hundred, and raised the standard of royalty. For the next seven years, from 1362 to 1369, when 1 Abbott's Khiva*LIFE OF TtMUR. 193 he was finally seated on the throne of Samarkand, Timflr was engaged, first in expelling the invaders from his native land, and afterwards in a death struggle with his brother-in-law, Amir Husain. Tugluk Timur Khan, who had driven Tim6r into the desert, was ruler of Kashgar, and of the boundless pastures further east; and he was at the head of a great army, composed of a race called Jetes, or Kalmuks, who were unconverted to the faith of Islam. Tugluk, who was of the race of Jagatai, left the country of Ma-wara-'n-Nahr under the rule of his son, Alyus Khawajah, returning to the pastures east of Kashgar. The first result of Timur's assumption of royalty, was a quarrel with Amir Husain, who took offence, and left him. Many old followers, however, continued to flock to his standard; and, after passing some months in hunting along the banks of the Oxus, he entered Sistan 1 at the head of a thousand horsemen, in 1362. He took several forts from the Baluchis of Sistan, but was eventually defeated, and wounded in the hand and foot; which obliged him to retire into the Garmsir, or hot regions of the coast of the 1 Sistan is a territory, between Persia and Afghanistan, sur rounded, except on the north, by wide deserts.

They encamped under the shelter of a hill, on the banks of a rivulet, and lived by the chase ; while their numbers gradually increased to fifteen hundred cavalry, and Timur found himself in a position to face the Jete armies under Alyus Khawajah, the son of Timur Tucluk, which were now in possession of his native land. The spirits of the young chief rose in proportion, the companions of his early days flocked around him, his ambitious hopes seemed once more to be near their accomplishment, and his heart was filled with gladness. Before encountering the enemy, he passed ten days in feasting and rejoicing, with his old com panions in arms.

His troops showered arrows upon them, which forced them to retire, and on the following morning he took them by surprise in their own camp, and put them to flight. Alyus Khawajah, overwhelmed with shame at having been defeated by such an 'inferior force, re treated to within twelve miles of Timor's native city of Kesh. At this time news came that Timur Tugluk was dead, and Alyus Khawajah, therefore, marched away with all his forces; closely followed by Timur, whose army rapidly increased in numbers. Once the retreating Jetes turned to face their foe, but Timur charged at the head of his troops, and finally drove them across the frontier. His native country was thus delivered from the invaders; once more the young chieftain was sovereign of the land. The citizens of Samarkand came out to meet him ; and, amidst the general rejoicings, his faithful wife, who, since the disaster in Sistan, had taken refuge in the Gurmsir, came to share the prosperity of her lord. The pretensions of Timur were disputed by his brother-in-law. Amir Husain, and the feud continued for five years, although the rivals were obliged to unite their forces, more than once, to resist an invasion of their common enemies, the Jetes. In 1364, Timur crossed the Jaxartes, and fought with the Jete army during the whole day.

The rain had converted the land into a swamp, but the Jagatais charged through it, and engaged the Jetes, who had received large reinforcements, during the whole of the following day. Timur lost two thousand men, and was obliged to retreat to Kesh; where he refreshed his troops, and eventually succeeded in clearing the land of the enemy. Am ir Husain, stirred up by jealousy, had now become Timor's implacable enemy; and Timur him self declared that, ' As there was only one God in the universe, so there should only be one monarch in a kingdom.' He defeated his rival in 1366, 1 and forced him to retire across the Oxus. In 1367 Amir Husain again attacked his brother- in-law, and Timur retreated to Tashkend, where he passed a month in pleasant idleness, hunting and hawking over the plains, and receiving forty eggs and a tureen of soup every morning, from the Kat Khodah, or ruler of the district. His peace was, however, again disturbed by Amir Husain, but his followers deserted him, and he gave himself up to Tlmnr, re questing permission to be allowed to retire to Mekkah. His successful rival at first consented; but many of the rude chiefs had cause to hate the wretched captive, who had been cruel and insolent, as well as avaricious, in the days of his prosperity. Timur appears to have been desirous to save his life, hut In this year Timor's faithful wife, the illustrious Aljay 11 a Agha, departed this life. ' Verily we belong to God,^ and to shall we return, 7 was Timiir's pious reflection.-—LIFE OF TlMUK. 197 lie gradually yielded to the clamours of his officers, and Amir Husain was killed by three chiefs, who dragged him out of a minaret, where he had taken refuge. Timur had now cleared his native land of sedi tious aspirants to the throne, as well as of foreign invaders. From the year 1369 until the day of his death, he held the sovereignty of Samarkand, while he extended his dominion over half the continent of Asia. He was formally enthroned in the city of Balkh, by four of the most revered Seyyids, or de scendants of the Prophet, and all the people held up their hands in prayer for his prosperity. When this ceremony was over, he crossed the Oxus, and marched to Samarkand, which he made the capital of his empire. 'From my twelfth year,' he says in his Institutes, ' I travelled over countries, combated difficulties, and hazarded my person in the hour of danger, until I vanquished empires, and established the glory of my name.' Timur's first important act was to assemble a Kurultai, or general meeting of all the principal chiefs, and of the amirs or commanders of tum&amp;ns (ten thousand men), and hdzarehs (one thousand men); and he then proceeded to regulate the affairs of his empire. 1 1 For a description of Samarkand, see Clavijo, p. 164 et seq, 2 Timur frequently convoked a Kurultai, or diet of liis nobles; as was also the custom of his predecessors. 1 He always addressed them in a speech calculated to attain their cordial assent; and, through them, to animate the zeal and courage of their followers.' —Malcolm's Persia, vol. i. p. 476,198 HISTORY OF PEESIA. Although Timur was the real sovereign, he only took the title of Amir; and, until the day of his death, all the affairs of state were conducted in the name of a puppet descendant of Jengiz-KMn, who was sometimes permitted to reside at Samarkand, but who was more frequently to be found serving in Timor's army. Yet Timur established all the out ward forms of etiquette m his court, aud each rank had its established place when they appeared before him. A council of state was formed, a code of regu lations was drawn up for his government, favours were conferred on his friends, permanent grants of land were made for charitable purposes, and the army was carefully organized. Timor's army, as the chief instrument of his power and his conquests, received the greatest share of his attention, and a large portion of his is de voted to the details of its organization. 1 It was divided into detachments of ten, a hundred, and a thousand men, each under separate officers, called respectively Oun-basMs, Uz-basMs,Ming-basMs, over whom there were many amirs, four Beglar Begs, and an Amiru- '1-Umara, who had authority 'over the whole army, and acted as the deputy of his sovereign. The Amiru-'l-Umara was distinguished by a standard; 1 Timur thus announces his intention, in drawing up l' 8 Institutes ;—* Be it known to my sons and descendants, that I have collected together these laws and regulations, for the wel governing of my dominions, as a model for others. Let them make these regulations the rule of their conduct in the affairs of then empire.'LITE OF TIMUR. 199 the subordinate amirs by spears with figures on their points, denoting the rank of those to whom they belonged; the Ming-bashis by a trumpet; and the inferior officers by drums. Great attention was also given to the supply of arms and provisions for the soldiers. Each man had two horses, a bow, quiver of arrows, sword, saw, axe, awl, thread, ten needles, and a leathern knapsack; and every eighteen men were provided with a tent between them. Each Oun-bashi was supplied with a tent, a coat of mail, sword, bow, quiver, and five horses; the Uz-bashis had ten horses apiece; the Ming-bashis, twenty; and the Amiru-'I-Umara, three hundred. Eules were laid down for guiding the tactics of the commanders when in the field; and, in choosing a position, they were particularly enjoined to take care to be near water, on a situation more elevated than that of the enemy, that their flanks and rear were covered, and that the ground in their front was extensive and open. But the noblest, and, considering his age and country, the most re markable part of Timur's army regulations, was the treatment of the conquered. It is but too true that in the heat of battle the orders, recorded in his Insti tutes, were frequently disregarded; but the fact of their existence proves that Timor's ideal standard of right was far in advance of other conquerors of his race and creed. He ordered that every soldier who had performed his duty, and fought with valour on the side of the enemy, if he sought shelter under his authority, should be treated with honour and regard.200 HISTORY OF PERSIA. since he had performed his duty, and acted with fidelity to his former master. The civil departments of Timor's government also received their share of attention at his hands, and he gave minute instructions respecting all the details of his administration. He superintended everything him self with a watchful eye; and, in the frequent audiences which he gave to his officers, every rank had a regular place assigned to it. The sons and other relations of the sovereign sat round the throne; the Seyyids and learned men stood on the right hand, the Amiru-'l- Umari, Beglar Begs, and amirs on the left hand, the Diw4n Begi, wazirs, and other civil officers opposite the throne, the' magistrates behind the wazirs, and the soldiers, with the title of Bahadur, in the left rear of the throne. The council of ministers, for the administration of civil affairs, was presided over by the Diwan Begi, under whom there was an Erz-Begi, or Presenter of Petitions, who communicated the complaints of the people, and four wazirs. The first superintended the state of the husbandmen, the produce, the levy of duties, the merchandise, and the police; the second had charge of the pay of the troops, the supply of pro visions, and the state and strength of the army; the third took possession of the effects of absentees and of the dead, received taxes, and restored the effects of the dead to their lawful heirs ; and the fourth superintended the receipts and general expenditure of the household of the sovereign. Although an enormous revenue was derived froniLIFE OF TtMUR. 203 Timur voluntarily defended himself at the bar of public opinion, and displayed some anxiety that the judgment of posterity might be in his favour. He said,—' If in any kingdom, tyranny, and oppression, and iniquity shall be predominant, it is the duty of a prince, from a regard to justice and the law, to expel and extirpate the authors of that iniquity, and to assault that kingdom. It is the duty of a victorious king to bring under his authority every kingdom where the people are oppressed by their rulers ; and thus I delivered Khurasan, and purified the kingdoms of Fars and 'Ir&amp;k, and Shaum.' 1 The fact that this great conqueror should have felt the necessity of framing some excuse to soothe his own conscience and to justify his conduct before posterity, is a proof that his was not the mind of a mere barbarian; and his wars were at least as excusable as many which have been undertaken in more modern times, and amongst more civilized people. 2 1 Institutes, p. 831. 2 The history of Timur's conquests is chiefly derived from the writings of two Eastern authors, namely, 'Aly of Yezd and Mir- khund. MMlah Sherifu-'d-Din 'Aly of Yezd wrote the Life of Timur at Shiraz, by order of his grandson, Ibrahim Mirza, in 1424, nineteen years after the conqueror's death. His work was entitled Zaffah-Ndmah. It was translated into French by M. Petis de 4 la Croix, a famous Oriental traveller and scholar, in 1772; and into English, from the French, by J. Darby in 1723. Mirkhund, who was born in 1432, flourished at the court of Husain Mirza at Herat, and wrote a general history of Persia from the Creation to the year 1471, entitled Eauzatu- s-Safah. After many years of disappointment from want of patronage, heHISTOEY OF PERSIA. For several years the operations of Timur's army were confined to incursions into Khuw^rizm, and frequent invasions of the country of his ancient enemies, the Jetes; but in 1376 he undertook a more important enterprise. Jojy, 1 the eldest son of Jengiz-KMn, re ceived the sovereignty of a vast territory from his terrible father, called Desht Kipchak, 2 which extended from the Caspian Sea, over the greater part of southern Eussia, to the shores of the Dnieper. He died in 1226, six months before Jengiz ; and his son Batu carried the Mongol arms into Eussia and Hungary, and spread terror through all the Christian countries of Europe. Batu died in 1256, and his descendants of the golden horde continued to tyrannize over Muscovy, until they were finally subdued, and confined to the Crimea, by was at length befriended by the munificent minister 'Aly Shir Beg, who obtained him a suitable dwelling near Herat, and assisted him in collecting materials. Mlrkhund died in 1498, and his son, Khondemir, wrote an abridgment of his father's work, called Khuldsatu~l~Ahhbar. Texeira, a Portuguese traveller, published a translated abstract of Mirkhund, and there is an English translation of Texeira, by Stephens; but the best translation of that portion of Mirkhund's work which relates to the history of Timur's conquests was pub lished in Major David Price's Muhammadan History, in 1821. There is also a translation of Mirkhund's history of the early kings of Iran, published by David Shea in 1832. 1 Jojy means 1 stranger' in Mongol, and he was so called because his mother was in captivity when he was born. Few names have had a greater number of spellings. D'Herbelot calls him Giougi; his name is spelt Dgoudgy by Petis de la Croix; Zuzi by the trans lator of Abu-'l-Ghazy Khan; Jugi, Tushi, and Chichi by the authors of the Universal History. 2 Desht Kipchak.

In 1318 Uzbeg Khan was lord of Desht KipcMk, and he introduced the religion of Muhammad into his dominions. On the death of Uzbeg KMn in 1342, his son, and afterwards his grand son, followed him, but in 1360 Urus KMn, descended from a younger son of Jojy, became sovereign of KipcMk. He reigned peaceably for several years; but at length Tokatmish, a member of his family, rose in rebellion, was defeated, and took refuge at the court of Timur, the new sovereign of Ma-wara-'n-Nahr. Timur saw in this feud a means of extending his power, and he received the fugitive with great honour. Urus KMn led an army against Timik, and the hostile forces met on the plains beyond the Jaxartes, but a terrible storm of snow and hail, accompanied by a hard frost, obliged Urus to retreat, and he died a few months afterwards. Timur then established Tokatmish as sovereign of Kipchak, and thus extended his in fluence, and the fame of his arms, through all the nomade tribes which wander over the interminable steppes of Central Asia. Yusuf Sufy, the ruler of Klmwarizm, alone defied the authority of Timur, and in 1378, the now powerful sovereign crossed the Oxus, and laid siege to his enemy's capital. Ylisuf challenged him to single combat, and Timur, in spite of the warnings and entreaties of his amirs, rode up to the 1 The seventh in succession from Jojy.

During the siege Yusuf died, and the place having been taken by assault, was utterly destroyed, the inhabitants being removed to Kesh, Timor's native town, which he had enlarged and beautified, and made his summer residence, when not engaged in war. No chief in the boundless regions of Turan could now dispute the supremacy of the sovereign of Ma- wara-'n-Nahr ; and Timor's ambition, increasing with his power, led him to contemplate the conquest of Irk. If Timur's theory of conquest could be admitted, that ' It is the duty of every prince to invade any country where tyranny, oppression, and iniquity are predominant,' Persia certainly offered all these pretexts for aggression to the lord of Turan. In 1380 he sent his eldest son Miran, then aged fourteen, with some experienced amirs, to assume the government of Khurasan. An excellent bridge of boats was thrown across the Oxus, the army advanced to Herat, and in 1381 the Persian provinces of Khnr- iMn and Mazanderan submitted to the conqueror. In the following years he added Sistan, Kandahar, Azerbaijan, and Georgia to his rapid conquests ; and in 1387 he encamped before the Persian city of Isfahan. The inhabitants submitted, and Timur's forces entered the city, exacting a contribution from the people, but securing their lives and property. During the night of November 16 a youth named Aly Ku- chapa raised an unruly rabble, and massacred manyLIFE OF TlMUR. 207 of the Jagatai soldiers. Timur was furious at this breach of faith, and ordered a general massacre of the people. After having taken this terrible revenge, he marched to Shirfi.z, 1 confirmed the Muzhaffars in their government, and returned to Samarkand in triumph. IrUn had now become a province of the empire of Timur; and in 1389 he summoned a at Akiar, near Kesh, to announce and celebrate his vic tories. The amirs and chiefs of tumans and hazarehs, were assembled at a solemn banquet, and two of the sons of the sovereign, Miran and 'Omar Shaikh, re ceived the government of the provinces of Khur4s&amp;n and Andekan. Timfir now prepared for the greatest and most extraordinary military exploit of his life, the invasion of the illimitable wilds of Kipchak. During his absence in Persia, Tokatmish, regardless of the debt of gratitude he owed to his benefactor, made several incursions across the Jaxartes, and was held in check, with difficulty, by Timur's young son, 'Omar Shaikh. In 1390 preparations were made, on a great scale, for the invasion of Kipchak, and the punishment of its ungrateful kMn. The officers were ordered to collect a year's provisions, for the troops under their command ; and each soldier was supplied with a horse, a bow and quiver of arrows, and a leathern water 1 During Timur's stay in the beautiful city of Shiraz, lie had a complimentary interview with Persia's greatest poet, the divine Hiifizh, who died two years afterwards.HISTOEY OF PERSIA, bottle. Every ten soldiers bad a tent, two mattocks, a spade, a hand saw, a hatchet, a hundred needles, an awl, about fourteen pounds of rope, a leathern knap sack, a copper pot, and a baggage horse. Having completed all the necessary preparations for his hazardous and daring campaign, Timur left Samar kand in 1390, crossed the Jaxartes by a temporary bridge at Khojend, and wintered at Tashkend, where he was attacked with a severe illness. In January 1391, the army marched out of Tashkend, and for three weeks the intrepid Timur led his troops over the arid and uninhabited wastes, to the north of the Caspian Sea. At length he reached an isolated hill called Ulugh Tauk, whence he viewed the vast plains of Kipchak, stretching away as far as the eye could reach in every direction. He caused a lofty cairn to be erected at this spot, as a memorial to other times of his memorable expedition. Hunting as he marched, Timur then crossed the river Yelanjok, in 54° north latitude, and his pro visions at length began to fail him. His soldiers rations were reduced to one bowl of broth a day, and great hunting parties were organised, encircling a vast space, and driving the game into the centre. Shaikh Daud, a chief who had been brought up from a child amidst these cheerless solitudes, was sent on in advance, with a small troop of horse, to reconnoitre the enemyj who had hitherto remained invisible. He succeeded in discovering their camp ; and in May 1391 Timur s army crossed the river Jaik, in 53° north latitude, an found itself face to face with the vast hordes of theLIFE OF TIMUR. 209 Khan of Kipchak, which were greatly superior in numbers to the invaders. A brilliant series of cavalry engagements followed, which ended in the defeat and flight of Tokatmish, and the host of Kipchak was scattered far and wide over the plain. A small rem nant escaped across the Volga. The conqueror was enchanted with the verdure of the plains between the rivers Volga and Jaik; and was not a little astonished at finding that immediately the sun set, the dawn of day was clearly perceptible in the East. He passed the month of June in hunting along the banks of the Volga, and commenced his return march in July. The plains were covered with his army. Great troops of cattle, sheep, and camels, were intermingled with the Jagatai cavalry and their prisoners, while the unwieldy portable pavilions of Timur and his amirs were dragged along by twenty-two oxen, eleven abreast. The ruts of these enormous waggons were twenty feet apart, and the axletrees were as large as a vessel's mast. The conqueror returned to Samarkand in the end of 1391 ; 1 and, in the following May, he again departed with a large army, to subdue the western parts of Persia, where the Muzhdffars had revolted. This was known as the expedition of five years. The first year was passed in reducing the forest- covered province of Mazanderan, along the southern shores of the Caspian; where an obscure town on the sea coast, near Amul, held out against his whole 1 In the meanwhile Timor's generals had crossed the river Irtish, and penetrated into the wilds of Siberia.210 HISTORY OF PERSIA. army. For the first and only time in his life, Tiraur, the great commander of cavalry, was forced to have recourse to naval warfare. A brigade of boatmen with their boats, and a band of slingers of wild fire, were sent from the Oxus to the Caspian, where they embarked, and invested the little town by land. The garrison then surrendered, and, being followers of the accursed sect of Hasan Sabah, 1 a general massacre followed. The conquest of Mazanderan having been completed, Timur wintered in the valley of the Gurgan. The second year was occupied in the subjugation of western Persia. Passing through Pars and Hamadan, the invading army overran the province of Luristan, crossed the river Karun at Ahwaz, and entered DizfuL 2 Meanwhile Mansur Muzhaffar, the ruler of ShMz, prepared to resist the invader, and a decisive campaign ensued.

Mans fir, the ruler of Fars, then engaged the mighty- conqueror ; but his Persians were defeated, and he himself was killed in single combat, by SMh Eokh, the son of Timur. The conqueror then entered the beautiful city of ShMz, exterminated the race of Muzhaffars, and com pletely subjugated the southern provinces of Persia. Timur did not remain long at Shlraz; the divine poet HMzh, whose society he had enjoyed during a former visit, was dead; and the wrath of the sovereign was only appeased by the slaughter of the rebellious people. There was nothing, therefore, to induce him to prolong his stay; and in September 1393, his triumphant army was led against Ahmed, the SuMn of BaghdM; who fled at his approach. 1 The Jagatai cavalry overtook the SuMn on the plain of Kerbela, near the Euphrates, and a skirmish with bows and arrows followed. The SuMn's followers again fled, rallied, and were again beaten off by the cavalry of Timur. A third time they rallied, and a desperate hand-to-hand conflict ensued, but Ahmed being by this time out of danger, his troops drew off. Timor's cavalry suffered the agonies of a raging thirst in their return across the Mesopotamian deserts, to BaghdM. Having rebuilt the mausoleum of the Tin Am Hanbal, which had been ruined by the inundations of the Tigris, Timur marched into Georgia, in 1394, and 1 The cruelty and misgovernment of Ahmed led the people of Baghdad to beseech Tlmftr to succour them.— vol. ii. p. 288.HISTORY OF PEESIA. drove all who opposed him into the fastnesses of the mountains. He sent the different corps of his army in various directions, to reduce the people to submission, while he relaxed the toils of conquest by hunting and festivity. At this time the births of his two grandsons, Ulugh Beg and Ibrahim Sultan, were celebrated with great splendour on the plains of Kars. The throne of Timur was raised in the midst of magnificent tents, with lovely damsels ranged around it. Musicians and singers were grouped behind, and the imrzas, amirs, nevyans, and foreign lords from Iran and Turan, joined their voices in prayers for the prosperity of the mighty sovereign. The festivities lasted for eight days. This short relaxation was interrupted by an irrup tion of the army of Tokatmish through the gates of Derbent, in the Caucasus. The Khan of Kipchak had recovered from the chastisement inflicted on him during Tlmur's memorable campaign, and had once more renewed hostilities. The conqueror, therefore, again prepared for war, and reviewed his vast army, on a plain about twenty- seven miles south of Derbent, in a line extending from the Caucasus to the shores of the Caspian. He then led his forces over the pass near Mount Elburz, and again encountered the army of Tokatmish. The cavalry on both sides fought fiercely, and charged each other with desperate speed ; but victory again declared on the side of her favourite, Tokatmish tied into the wilds of Siberia, and Timur, halting on the plains of Astrakhan, installed a son of Urus Khan, as the new Khan of Kipchak, ■tLITE OF Tl-MUR. 213 Before returning to Ms own dominions, the mighty lord of TurUn entered Muscovy, penetrated to the shores of the Dnieper, and, repassing the Caucasus, caused a great festival to be held on a plain in Georgia, to celebrate his victorious campaign. The sovereign was seated on a throne, in a splendid pavilion, the air was perfumed with rose water, and bottles of Georgian wine were uncorked, amidst songs and music. The man, who had not many years before been a destitute wanderer in the deserts of Khuwarizm, had now arrived at the highest pitch of earthly glory. The chiefs on the western and northern shores of the Caspian submitted to his sway ; his eldest surviving son Miran was governor of Azerbaijan; the wealthy city of Ormuz, 1 in the Persian Gulf, paid him tribute, and all the people of Central Asia acknowledged him as their sovereign. He returned to Samarkand in 1396, and occupied himself for some time in the arrangement of the internal affairs of his vast empire, ■and in erecting splendid edifices in the land of his birth. Superb mosques and palaces were built at Samarkand and Kesh, gardens were laid out full of fragrant flowers, marble was transported from Azer- 1 Ormuz, which was for ages the great emporium of trade in the Persian Gulf, was originally founded by a colony of Arabs, and the city appears to have enjoyed centuries of peace and commercial prosperity.

The king of this new Ormuz considered it prudent to send tribute to Timur,214 HISTORY OF PERSIA. baijan, and porcelain, to adorn the chambers, from the distant empire of China. For a time the enjoyment of great power, and the opportunities to work much good, in establishing peace throughout his now enormous empire, had charms for Timur; but, after an interval of rest, the conqueror still found the lust of conquest strong upon him, and, from the heights of Ma-wara-'n-Nahr, he looked down, with longing eyes, on the fertile plains of India. Having conceived the idea of conquering the rich empire of Hindustan, he asked counsel of his sons and nobles, but they all opposed it, except SMh Eokh. 1 His resolution, however, had been already taken, and his grandson Pir Muhammad crossed the Indus, and laid siege to Multan. Meanwhile Timur led his army across the Oxus, and commenced a new campaign, in 1398, by attacking the infidel mountaineers who inhabit the ravines of the Hindu Kiish, that tremendous range of mountains, which was called by the Arabs, 'the stony girdle of the earth.' It was in the month of March that Timur, with sixty-two thousand men, entered the defiles of that mighty range which rises in a bold and precipitous line, with sides bare, black, and polished, from the plains of Balkh and Kunduz. At that time of year, and until the end of June, the passes are clear of snow,- but they are destitute of vegetation, and mural preci- 1 ' My design for reducing Hindustan.

The summits of the peaks are covered with eternal snow. On the approach of the invaders the mountaineers retired into the deep ravines, where they were pro tected by snow drifts. No difficulties, however, could daunt the intrepid conqueror, or turn him from his purpose. True, the precipices which he must pass to reach the retreat of the infidels, were perpendicular, but the resources of Timor's mind were inexhaustible, and he resolved upon a plan as audacious as it was novel. He ordered his army to be lowered down the rocky walls by ropes, from ledge to ledge. The sove reign himself was lowered down on a stage of planks, secured together by iron rings, and the operation was five times repeated. The whole party was now on foot, except Timur himself, whose horse had also been lowered down ; and this put them on equal terms with the mountaineers, who were, however, so amazed at the unexpected appearance of the invaders, that they abandoned their stronghold, sued for mercy, and humbly submitted to the authority of the mighty ' lord of the grand conjunctions.' 1 Timik then continued 1 Sdhih Kirdn, which was one of Timur's titles, means, 4 lord of the grand conjunctions.'

Hindustan had been ruled by Muslim conquerors since the days of Mahmud of Ghaznah, and at this time Mahmud, of the house of Togluk, reigned at Delhi over a disorganised empire, consisting of a Muslim army, a Hindu population, and various Eajpiit states, which were virtually independent. Timur crossed the Indus in 1398, and united his army with that of Pir Muhammad, on the banks of the Sutlej. He then marched to Delhi, slaughtered a vast number of prisoners who hindered his progress, and encamped on the banks of the Jamna, in January 1399; where he found the Indian army, under king Mahmud, drawn up in order of battle, with ten thousand horse, forty thousand foot, and a brigade of elephants. Timur, to use his own words, ' resolved to appear Weak in the sight of the SuMn of Delhi,' and he surrounded his army with a ditch. This stratagem filled the Indians with presumptuous confidence, they marched into the plain, were charged furiously by the Jagatai cavalry, and utterly defeated. Delhi fell into the hands of the conquerors, and an accidental collision with the citizens led to a general massacre. The holy city of Muttra met with the same fate; and TimAr, satisfied with having become a or ' slayer of infidels,' determined to return to Samarkand. He marched by the sources of the Ganges, Kashmir, and the Panjab, and crossing the Indus by a bridge of boats, he made a* triumphal progress through the defilesLITE OF TlMUR. 217 of the Hindu Kiish, to his capital, which he reached in April 1399. 'Spoils above measure' were brought from India by the conqueror, who commenced the erection of a grand mosque at Samarkand. Ninety captured elephants 1 conveyed the stones from the quarries. This splendid edifice, the monument of Timur's con quests, consisted of a vaulted roof, supported on four hundred and eighty pillars of hewn stone, with doors of brass, walls decorated with inscriptions in relief, and lofty minarets at the four corners. It is now a mere heap of ruins. After a brief season of repose, the conqueror was again obliged to take the field, owing to the deplorable misgovernment of his eldest son, Miran Mlrza, in Azer baijan ; 2 and having tranquillised that province, he prepared to invade the territory of the Ottoman Sultan Bayazid. The towns of BaghdM, Aleppo, 3 and Damascus were taken, and the Turk was utterly routed at Angora, on July 20, 1402. 4 These transactions are faithfully 1 See Clavijo, p. 156. 2 Ibid. p. 95. 3 D'Herbelot has recorded an interview between Timiir and some doctors of law, after the capture of Aleppo, during which the conqueror declared that he had never undertaken any war without deliberation. Bib. Or., vol. ii. p. 517. Gibbon repeats a portion of this curious conversation, chap. Ixv. 4 The story of the iron cage, in which Bayazid is said to have been confined, is not mentioned by any early historian of the life of Timur, except Ahmed ibn 'Arabshah. The fable afterwards ap peared in a modern Ottoman chronicle, translated by Leunclavius. D'Herbelot stated that it was not even mentioned by 'Arabshah, but Sir W. Jones has detected the error of the French orientalist,jjl !| J 218 HISTORY OF PERSIA. recorded by the Spanish, ambassador ; 1 who followed the conqueror on his return march to Samarkand. The events which followed the magnificent festivities and grand rejoicings, at which Clavijo was present, and which are also fully described by the Eastern historian, 'Aly of Yezd, concluded the career of this extraordinary man. Clavijo gives an account of the insolent message of the Chinese envoys, which excited the wrath of the aged warrior, who resolved upon invading the Celestial Empire in the depth of winter. He marched out of Samarkand, on January 8, 1405, 2 in a heavy fall of snow; and, crossing the Jaxartes upon the ice, lie encamped at a place called Otrar. In February he was attacked by fever and ague, and he died on the 17th of that month, in the year 1405, aged sixty-nine, leaving thirty-six male descendants. Timur's body was embalmed with musk and rose-water, wrapped in linen, laid in an ebony coffin, and sent to Samarkand, where it was buried. According, to 'Aly of Yezd, Timur was tall and stout, but well shaped. His complexion was ruddy and fair; he .had a large flowing beard, broad shoulders, and was very strong. He could not bear a lie, but loved the naked truth. He was bold, courageous, feared, and respected. and quotes the passage in his works.—Sir W. Jones's Works, vol. &gt;'• p. 547. 1 See Clavijo, p. 73, et seq. 2 He took with him several thousand loads of corn, intending to sow it along the line of march, as a supply for his troops on tieir return.— 'Aly of Yezd.LIFE OF Thltn. 219 This picture was drawn by a friendly hand; he is described in very different colours by his enemy, Ahmed ibn 'Arabshah, who makes the Spirit of Winter address the dying conqueror thus :— c Stop thy rapid career, thou unjust tyrant! How long dost thou mean to carry flames over an unhappy world? If thou art a spirit of hell, so am I. We are both old, and our occupation is the same, that of sub jugating slaves. But proceed to extirpate mankind, and make the earth cold! yet thou wilt find at last that my blasts are colder. If thou canst boast of countless bands, who, faithful to thy orders, harass and destroy, know that my wintry days are, with God's aid, destroyers also;—and by the Almighty that liveth, I will abate thee nothing. Thou shalt be overwhelmed with my vengeance, and all thy fire shall not save thee from the cold death of the icy tempest.' 1 Undoubtedly Timur's conquests were the cause of much suffering to the human race; but, on the other hand, he certainly was not the remorseless tyrant he is represented by 'Arabshah, and his other enemies. His boundless ambition led him to contemplate the subjugation of the whole world, and he lost no oppor tunity of extending his power; yet there is evidence that he had loftier aims than the mere gratification of his lust for conquest. He at least persuaded himself that in conquering Muhammadan countries, he de- 1 Malcolm's History of Persia. Goethe gives a poetical version of this speech {Gedichte, p. 394) ; and Sir W.

He was idolized by his soldiers, and by his own family, and he was free from the more despicable vices of Eastern sovereigns ; but the most marked feature in his character was his untiring energy and activity. 'When I clothed myself in the robes of empire,' he says, in his Ins ' I shut my eyes to safety, and to the repose which is found on the bed of ease.' The name of Timur is frequently coupled with that of Jengiz-KMn; yet the latter was a rude un cultivated barbarian, while there is evidence that the former was versed in all the knowledge of his age and country. We know, from his that Tmiur was taught to read the Kuran; he appears to have cultivated his own language, and he under stood and admired the Persian odes of Hafizh. His native language was the Turki, which, at that time, prevailed from the Ulugh Tagh mountains to the Hindu Kush, and from the Caspian to the Kobi Desert. The period between the reign of Timur and that of Mber, was the golden age of Turki literature, and the princes of the great conquerors family wrote poetry in their own tongue, and gave liberal encouragement to its cultivation amongst their courtiers. 'Aly Shir Beg, the Grand Wazir to Husain Mirza, composed a poem in the Turki language, and also wrote a complete prosody; and the other amirs, at the courts of the Timuride princes, while they studied the literature of Persia, did not neglectTHE TtM^RIDES. 221 the poetry of their native Turki. Timur seems to have given the first impulse to these intellectual pur suits amongst his countrymen; and, though he owes his fame chiefly to his conquests, it would be unfair to forget his liberal encouragement of learned men, his love of the game of chess, and his claims to literary merit, in the composition of his and He has no right to the title of a reformer or of a benefactor to the human race; but neither was he a coarse and ruthless destroyer of his fellow-creatures, like Jengtz, and so many other Asiatic conquerors. He lived in an age and amongst a people to whom mercy and toleration were unknown. The realization of his own ideal of a perfect sovereign would have been impossible; yet he has some claim to the ad miration of posterity, and, with Gibbon, we may excuse a generous enthusiasm in the reader of the for their great author. 1 Timur was succeeded by his grandson Khalil SuMn, who soon squandered away all his vast trea sures at Samarkand in gratifying the wishes of a lovely girl, named Shahdu-'l-Mulk, the Delight of the Country.' The old Mongol generals were scandalised, and sending their new emperor a prisoner to Kashgar, they led his beloved in chains through Samarkand. Khalll Sultan passed his captivity in writing love songs. 1 Malcolm, in his History of Persia, thus sums up the character of Timur :— 1 Though one of the greatest of warriors, he was one of the worst of monarchs. He was able, brave, and generous ; but ambitious, cruel, and oppressive.'222 history of persia. Shah Eokh, the youngest son of Timur, was then called to the head of affairs, a.d . 1408. He generously liberated Khalil SuMn, restored his love to his arms, and gave him the government of Khurasan. The lovers were buried in one grave in 1409, Shahdu-'l- Mulk having stabbed herself on her husband's death. Shah Eokh received his name from his father having heard the news of his birth while playing at chess, and when he had just checked his adversary's king with his castle; a move which, in Persia, is called SMh Rokh. This prince was brave, generous, and learned. He repressed the incursions of the Turkish tribe of Khan KoyunM, ' Black Sheep,' in Azerbaijan; and restored many of the cities which his father had ruined, espe cially Herat, which he fixed upon as his capital. Herat, the ancient Aria of the Greeks, about 279 miles east of Mash-had, the present capital of KhurMn, is situated in a spacious plain, 30 miles long and 15 broad, and on all sides surrounded by lofty mountains. The plain is watered by the river Herirud, and is covered with villages and highly cultivated fields and gardens. The city covers an area of one square mile, surrounded by a lofty wall and wet ditch. On each side there is a gate whence spacious bazars lead towards the centre of the city. The principal one, from the south, is covered with a vaulted roof. Herat is well supplied with water; and besides the public fountains on either side of the bazars, nearly every private house has also a jet of water in its court yard. The citadel, a castle of burnt brick with towers atTHE TIMUMDES. 223 the angles, was rebuilt by SMh Eokh in the northern face of the city wall. Shah Rokh spent great sums in restoring and beau tifying Herat. His court was magnificent, and men of science and learning were encouraged to frequent it. In 1419 he sent an embassy to the Emperor of China, with letters written by himself, which are still extant. The envoys returned to Herat in 1422. 1 Shah Eokh also sent one of his followers, named 'Abdu-'r-Eizzak, on an embassy to India: and the adventurous envoy wrote a most entertaining account of his voyage. 2 'Abdu-'r-Eizzak set out from Herat in 1442, and travelled across the desert of Kirmin to the famous port of Ormuz; which he describes as a place which has not its equal on the surface of the globe:— ' The merchants of Syria, Egypt, Eum, Ears, Khurasan, 1 See Asiatic Miscellanies, vol. i., Calcutta, 1785, for a transla tion of Shah Kokh's letters to the Emperor of China, and an account of the embassy. 2 'Abdu-'r-Rizzak was born at Herat in 1413, where his father was Kadhi. His terror at the sea, and his sea sickness, are described most graphically in his Journal :— 4 As soon as I caught the swell of the vessel, and all the terrors of the sea presented themselves to me, I fell into so deep a swoon that for three days respiration alone indicated that life remained within me.' On his return voyage, 1 it blew so hard that the captain, although familiarized with the navigation of all the seas, shed bitter tears, and forgot all his science. The sails were torn, and the mast was entirely bent by the shock of the wind. With tears in my eyes, I gave myself up for lost. At the sight of the agitated sea, overset by the tempestuous winds, I drew from my breast an icy sigh, which tore my very soul.' The narrative of 'Abdu-'r-Eizzak was translated by M. Quatrem^re, and an English version, ably edited by Mr. Major, is included in one of the volumes of the Hakluyt Society.— India in the Fifteenth Century,HISTORY OF PERSIA.

From Ormuz he sailed to Calicut, on the Malabar coast; and thence he proceeded to the court of the great Brahmanical Eajah of Bijanagar, in the Dekkan. In April 1444, he returned to Ormuz, and died at Herat in 1482. On the death of Shah Eokh in 1446, he was suc ceeded by his son Ulugh Beg, an amiable prince who was devoted to learned and peaceful studies. Under his auspices the well-known astronomical tables, which are still called by his name, were composed, by the two most learned astronomers of the age. The work which contains them was written at Samarkand, and published under the title of 1 The Tables of Ulugh Beg were first brought to the knowledge of Europeans by the great orientalist and mathematician, John Greaves, Savilian Professor at Oxford, 1642-48.

A crowd of the descendants of the great Timur then disputed and fought for the provinces of his vast empire. B&amp;ber, a nephew of Ulugh Beg (not the great Baber), seized on Khurasan, but soon drank himself to death, though he had taken the pledge at the shrine of Im&amp;m Eazha at Mash-had. After a period of strife, Abu-Sa'id, grandson of Miran Shah, the son of Timlir, assisted by the Uzbeg tribes of Tatary, then seized upon BukMra, a.d. 1450. In 1456 he entered Khur&amp;s&amp;n, and made war upon the powerful Turkish tribe of Kara Koyunld, ' Black Sheep,' which had overrun Persia; but in 1468 he was taken prisoner and killed by Uzun Hasan, a chief of the Ak Koyunlu, 'White Sheep,' another powerful Turkish tribe. Out of Abu-Sa'id's eleven sons, SuMn Ahmed became king of Bukhara, and was succeeded by his brother NasM, who died in 1499 ; and 'Omar Shaikh became ruler of the small principality ofFarganah, some distance east of Bukhara, in a.d . 1492.

Timur; and, after a brave resistance, Baber was driven out of BukMra and Andekan, and forced to take refuge in Kabul. Here he collected an army of faithful followers; and, crossing the Indus, founded the famous dynasty of the Great Moguls in India. One more prince of the house of Timur, SuMn Husain Mlrza, continued to reign at Herat. 1 ( a.d. 1487-1506.) He was a strong man, with a grey beard and straight narrow eyes. He usually wore gay coloured red and green woollen clothes, a cap of black lamb-skin, and a broad showy turban tied round it, He was lively and pleasant, but his temper was rather hasty; and during nearly twenty years that he was king of Khurasan, not a day passed in which he did not drink wine after mid-day prayer. He was a brave and valiant man, often engaging sword in hand, and no person of the race of Timiir equalled him in the use of the scimitar. Although a prince of great dignity, Husain Mirza was as fond as a child of keeping butting rams, and of amusing himself with cock fighting and flying pigeons. The Muslim princes of Central Asia were often fond of training pigeons, which were taught to take circular flights, to tumble in the air, and to attack each other when on the wing. 2 1 The following account of SuMn Husain Mirza and his court, is taken from the Memoixs of his cousin B&amp;ber, who visited Herat soon after his death—Translated by Leyden and Erskine, 1826. 2 The Emperor Akbar, in India (1556-1605), was very fond of training pigeons. ' The pigeon-houses of 'Omar Shaikh Mirza an SuMn Husain Mirza, are now forgotten, such improvements have mmTHE TtMURIDES. 227 Husain Mirza had fourteen sons and eleven daughters. His first wife, Begah Sultan Begum of Merv, was extremely cross-tempered, and fretted him beyond endurance, till at length he divorced her. ' What could he do ? ' exclaims Baber— A bad wife in a good man's house, Even in this world, makes hell on earth. 'May the Almighty remove such a visitation from every good Muslim ; and God grant that such a thing as an ill-tempered, cross-grained wife, be not left in the world!' SuMn Husain Mirza was a patron of learned men, and the amirs of his court were as famous for their literary attainments as for deeds of arms. 'Aly Shir Beg, 1 the Mirza's friend and school-fellow, cultivated poetry in the Turki language, and also wrote a complete letter writer, and a prosody. The Seyyid Bedr was an excellent dancer, and his sovereign's boon companion in his drinking bouts. Bedru-'d-Din was a great jumper, and could leap over seven horses abreast.

He was educated in the same school as SuMn Husain Mirza, which event led to a life-long attachment between them. 'Aly Shir became Grand Wazir at Herat, afterwards was Governor of Astrabad, and then retired into private life, devoting his leisure to science and literature. He died in 1500.228 HISTORY OF PERSIA. lakcliy understood astronomy and the use of the astro labe ; and of Muhammad Seyyid Urus it was said, that his bow was strong, his arrow long, its range far, and its aim sure. The immortal poets, Jami and Hatifi, also frequented the splendid court of Husain Mirza, at Herat; and Abdu-'l-Ghafar of Lar, the friend of Jami, wrote the poet's life. 1 Another versifier was Mirza Murtag, who was so madly fond of the game of chess, that when he met two persons who understood the game, while he played with one, he used to hold the skirts of the other's clothes, to prevent his going away. There were also great numbers of painters and musicians. But the greatest ornaments of the court of Herat were the two historians, father and son, Mirkhund and Khundemir. Mirkhund, 2 after a youth of pleasure, 1 Jami was born at Jam, near Herat, a.h . 817, and died a.h . 898. His chief works were the Silsileh Uzzahtb, a poem, in three books; Sikdndar Ndmeh, an epic on the deeds of Alexander the Great; the Diwdn i-Jdmi, a collection of poems; and Yusuf via Zuldkha. Hatifi was to have written a poem in praise of the victory of Ismail Shah over the Uzbegs, but he died prematurely in a.h . 900. He was a nephew of Jami. 2 Mirkhund says in his Preface :— , 4 In the spring of life, as well as the period of matured age, which comprehend the most delightful season of existence, and the most delicious hours of life, my aspiring mind, and soul, ambitious of at taining enlarged views, became passionately attached to the perusa of historical records, which alone supply the means of fully un er standing the various customs which prevail among the various races of mankind/ , After many years of disappointment, from want of patronage, was at length befriended by 'Aly Shir Beg, to whom he devoted two pages of compliment, in return.

He wrote a general History of Persia from the Creation to 1471 a.d., and died in 1498. His son Khundemlr wrote an abridgment of his father's History, and also a History of the Mongols and Tatars in 1508 a.d . 1 Khundemir came to Ember's court in 1528, soon after the invasion of India, and remained with that illustrious prince until his death. The great historian died in the camp of Baber's son, Humayun, during the expedition to Gujr^t, in 1534. SuMn Husain Mirza died in April 1506 ; and the same year Shaibany Khan, with his conquering Uzbegs, took Khuwarizm. It had been stoutly defended by an named Husain Sufy, who fell in the assault. amir 'The blessing of God,' says Baber, 'rest on Husain Sufy, who never hesitated for a moment, in the midst of danger and distress, gallantly to expose his life at the call of duty.'

Husain Mirza was succeeded by his two soas, Badiyatu-'z-Zaman and Muzhaffar Husain, who were to reign jointly. The two young kings, though highly accomplished at the social board, possessed no know ledge whatever of warlike operations. They stood no chance against ShaiMny Khan and his terrible Uzbegs, who invaded KhurMn in 1507, and occupied Herat. Muzhaffar was slain, and Badiyatu-'z-Zaman took refuge with the Shah of Persia, who allowed him to live at Tabriz. When Sultan Salim captured that city, he was sent to Constantinople, where he died.

Abu-'l-GMzy KMn, the lineal descendant of Shai- bany, grandson of Jengiz-Khan, was the son of Arap Muhammad, the ruler of Khiva. Owing to civil wars between his brothers, he fled into Persia in 1633, and was detained in a sort of honourable captivity by the Shah, for ten years. At length he effected his escape from IsfaMn, and journeying in disguise through Khur&amp;s&amp;n, he reached Khiva, and was proclaimed Khan in 1643. In 1655 he invaded BukMra; but always proved a true and faithful ally to Persia, and was of great service in keeping the lawless Turkmans and the turbulent amir of BukMra, Abdu-'l-Aziz Khan, in constant check. Abu-'l-GMzy passed all his leisure time in the diligent study of the genealogy of all the Mongol and Tatar tribes, and in collecting materials for their history. He died in 1663, and was succeeded by his son, Anusha KMn. The labours of Abu-'l-GMzy resulted in the produc tion of a work in the Mongol language, called the Shajari Turki, in ten parts. The first nine give an account of the ancestry and deeds of Jengiz-Khan, and the last treats of his own reigning dynasty in Khiva The work came to the knowledge of Europeans in a very remarkable way. A Swedish officer, named Strahlenburg, had been taken prisoner by the Eussians, and sent to Tobolsk, where he remained for thirteen years. A merchant chanced to arrive there with a manuscript of Abu-'l-GMzy's work, which was bought by Strahlenburg; and, on his release, he brought it with232 HISTORY OF PERSIA. him to Europe. It has since been translated into German, French, and English. 1 On the expulsion of Timor's family from Persia, the Kurdish dynasties of Kara Koyunlu, 'BlackSheep,' and Ak Koyunlu,' White Sheep,' reigned there for a short period. The former had been established in Azerbaijan, by Kara Yusuf, as early as 1410. His son. Amir Iskan- dar, waged war with Shah Eokh; and, on his death, his brother Jehan Shah, in 1437, not only overran 'Irak, Ears and Kirman, but in 1457 besieged and pillaged the city of Herat. In 1468, however, the dynasty of the Black Sheep was put an end to by Uzun Hasan, the chief of the tribe of White Sheep, then only ruler of Diabekr. He defeated and killed Jehan Shah, and also overthrew Abu-Sa'id, the prince of the house of Timtir, as has been before mentioned, A.D. 1468. Uzun Hasan thus became sovereign of Persia. He engaged in one war with Muhammad II, the Ottoman Sultan, but received such a lesson that he never could be induced to provoke hostility from that quarter a second time. He, however, reigned until his death in 1477. 2 His grandson, Alamut, son of YaMh, the last of the White Sheep, was dethroned by SMh Ismail 1 See Stralilenburg's Siberia, pp. 127-41. Abu-'l -Ghazys work •was published in French, at Leyden, in 1726 ; and in Bnglisi, in 1730, in 2 vols, octavo. Gibbon constantly quotes it. 2 Caterino Zeno was sent as an ambassador from Venice, to Uzun Hasan, ruler of Persia, in 1471. His travels were published im mediately on his return home ; but the edition is so rare that even Eamusio, who gives an account of them in his collections, ecuUZUN HASAN. 233 Siify, the famous founder of the Sufawi dynasty, and restorer of the long lost nationahty of Persia. Uzun Hasan married a daughter of Oalo Johannes, emperor of Trebizond, of the Imperial house of the Comneni, and his daughter Martha became the mother of Shah Ismail Sufy. For a period of 850 years, Persia had been under the domination of Turan, had groaned under the yoke of Arab, Turkish, and Mongol conquerors; yet during that long succession of centuries of misrule and anarchy, the Persian mind had not only lost none of its ancient vigour, but had displayed its energy in unprecedented strength. The poetic philosophy of the Sufis had flourished and developed itself. ' The Mesnavi of Jelalu-'d-Din,'says Malcolm,' which teaches in the sweetest strains that all nature abounds with Divine love; the works of the celebrated J ami, which breathe in every line the most ecstatic rapture ; the book of moral lessons of the eloquent Sa'ady; and the lyric and mystic odes of Hafizh may be termed the scriptures of the Sufis of Persia.' In astronomy, physic, and medicine, the names of never get sight of a copy. There is a copy in the Grenville Library (British Museum), of the date 1558, printed at Venice, with a map. Another edition -vvas printed at Venice in 1783, and another in 1808. Murray mentions Zeno in vol. iii. (^SiVe), pp. 6-9. Barbaro and Contarini also went on embassies to Persia. Barbaro, Contarini, and Caterino Zeno, are included in the collection of Ramusio. The travels of Barbaro and Contarini, edited by Lord Stanley of Alder- ley, and those of Caterino Zeno, and others, edited by Mr. Charles Grey of the India Office, compose the last volume issued by the Hakluyt Society. They give very full and valuable information respecting Persia in the days of Uzun Hasan and Shah Ismail Sufy.234 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. Avicenna and many other learned Persians are well known; and Firdausy (Ferdosi), Fadhl-Allah, Sherifu- 'd-Din 'Aly, Mirkhund, and Khundemir, have given Persian literature a claim to rank high both in poetry and history. Thus when, under the Sufawi dynasty, the Persians became once more an independent and powerful nation, they found a very rich and beautiful literature to in spire them with noble feelings and to increase their civilization. But the long domination of Turan had also created a very important change for the worse, in altering the nature of the population of Persia, by constant inunda tions of strange tribes; and the people over whom the Sufawi dynasty ruled were very different from the ancient Persians of Sassanian and earher times. This change will be more particularly described in the chapter on the Sufawi dynasty.235 CHAPTER IX. THE LIFE OF BiBER. BAbek , the founder of the empire of the great Moguls in India, though he never ruled over any part of Persia, was intimately connected with that country in many ways; and no historical account of the land which was conquered by Timur, and lost by Abu-Sa'id, would be complete without a biographical sketch of their illustrious descendant. Baber visited Herat; he was the close ally of Ismail, the SMh of Persia ; the intimate friend of the Persian historian, Khundemir ; the enthusiastic admirer of the poet Jami; and, above all, the of Baber give a clearer insight into the every-day life of the Asiatic princes of that period, than any other Writings now extant. 'Omar Shaikh, Ember's father, had received the government of the kingdom of Farganah from his father, Abu-Sa'id, the great-grandson of Timur, and ruler of all Persia, Transoxiana, and Kabul. Abu-Sa'id was killed in 1468 (in what Baber always calls ' the disaster of 'Irlk'), and, of his other sons, Ahmed became king of Bukhara, MahmM of Kunduz, and Ulugh of Kabul. Their cousin, the renowned SuMn236 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Husain Mirza, was king of Khurasan, with his capital at Herat. 'Omar Shaikh was the fourth son of Abu-Sa'id, and was born in the year 1456. He is described as having been of low stature, very corpulent, with a short bushy beard. He wore his tunic very tight, insomuch that, as he was wont to contract his belly when he tied the strings, when he let himself out again, the strings often burst. He never neglected his prayers, and devoted much of his time to reading the Kuran and the Shah Nameh. He was of an excellent temper, affable, eloquent, and generous; yet brave withal and manly, and he had such uncommon force in his fists that he never hit a man whom he did not knock down. Twice every week he indulged in a drinking party, on which occasions he was a pleasant companion, and in the course of conversation used often to cite appropriate verses from the poets. He played a great deal at backgammon, and also at games of chance with dice, and was much addicted to the use of maajuns, or intoxicating sweetmeats. 'Omar Shaikh's favourite wife was named Kutlak Nigar Khanum. She was descended from the mighty Jengiz-Khan, and was the mother of the illustrious Baber. The king of Farg&amp;nah's chief amirs or nobles were Khawajah Husain Beg, who was a good -humoured man, excelling at songs in drinking parties; and Hasan Y&amp;kfrb Beg, who was clever and active, an excellent archer, and very famous for his skill in playing at leap-frog.THE LIFE OF BABEE* 237 Farganah is a country of small extent, but abounding in grain and fruits. It is bounded on the east by Kashgar, on the west by Samarkand, on the south by the lofty range of mountains separating it from Badak- sMn, and on the north by the desert. The river Syr or Jaxartes flows through it, and receives several tribu taries. There were seven districts on the south, and two on the north of the river. Those on the south were Andekan, Ush, Marghinftn, Khojend, and Asferah. Andekan, the capital of Farganah, was built on a small stream, tributary to the Jaxartes. The district yields a plentiful supply of excellent grapes and melons, it abounds in game, and the inhabitants are remarkable for their beauty. Ush, about sixteen miles to the south-east of Ande kan, is built on the same stream. The district has an abundant supply of water, and the air is very salubrious. On both banks of the stream there are gardens where roses and violets grow in great pro fusion; and near the banks, outside the town, there was a pleasant meadow of clover, where travellers loved to rest. It was a standing joke of the common people of Ush, in Baber's time, to carry across the stream all such as fall asleep there. In all Farganah, for healthiness and beauty of situation, there is no place that equals Ush. Marghindn is twenty-eight miles west of Andekan. It is a fine district, noted for its apricots and pome granates, and the game and venison are also excellent;238 HISTORY OF PERSIA. $ but the people are noisy and turbulent, and notorious for tbeir blustering. Khojend, about 100 miles west of Andekan, and about tlie same distance east of Samarkand, is a very ancient city. The citadel is situated on an eminence overlooking the Jaxartes. Khojend is a good sporting country; the deer, the mountain goat, and the fowl of the desert are plentiful, but the air is extremely bad. Asferah is situated at the foot of a range of moun tains, and possesses numerous streams and beautiful gardens abounding in almond trees. It is 36 miles south-west of Marghinan. On the north of the Jaxartes are the districts of Akhsi and Kasan. . Akhsi is 36 miles west of Andekan. The river Jaxartes flows under the walls of the castle, which is situated on a high precipice. The* melons, in the district, are excellent, and there is plenty of game. Kasan is to the north of Akhsi. The air is salu brious, and the gardens in the district are very beau tiful. All around the country of Farganah there are ex cellent yailaks, or summer stations in the mountains. Such was the country over which Baber was called to govern, when only in his twelfth year. On June 9, 1494, as his father, 'Omar Shaikh, was sitting on the top of his pigeon-house, in the fortress of Akhsi, the building gave way, and, being precipitated from the summit, with his pigeons, ' he took his flight to the other world.'THE LIFE OF BABEE. 239 Zahiru-'d-Din 1 Muhammad, surnamed Baher, or ' The Tiger,' was born on February 14,1483. On the death of his father he succeeded to his small kingdom, in troublous times, and when surrounded by enemies ; but from the first he displayed extraordinary talent and determination. Taking advantage of his youth, his paternal uncle, Ahmed, invaded Farganah from the side of Samarkand, while his maternal uncle, Mahmud, a Mongol prince who ruled at Tashkend and Shahrokhia, advanced, with the same purpose, from the north. The invaders, however, retreated, and Ahmed died soon afterwards, in July 1494. This prince was a tall man, with extremely pleasant manners, and excelled in archery; but latterly he became very fat, would drink without intermission for thirty or forty days at a stretch, and on the days he did not drink, he ate pungent substances. His brother Malimud succeeded him in Bukhara, but died the following year, when his son Baisanghar became king of Bukhara; while one of his chief amirs, Khusru, assumed independent sovereignty in Kunduz, after having murdered two of the sons of his benefactor. ' He was a vile traitor,' says Baber, ' and had not the spirit to face a bam-door fowl.' Baisanghar Mirza, the new king of Bukhara, was an elegant and accomplished young prince; but, like most of his kindred, he was addicted to excessive drinking. He occasionally wrote verses, and the 1 4 Defender of the Faith.'240 HISTORY OF PERSIA. following lines, which were composed by him, testify to his jovial propensities : Like an unsubstantial shadow, I fall here and there, And if not supported by a wall, drop flat on the ground. For a few years after the retreat of his uncles, Baber ontinued to enjoy peace in his paternal dominions; nd to complete his education at Andekan, under the utelage of his beloved old master, the learned Khawajali Moulana Khazy. The family of Timur were of the Turkish race, and spoke a language called the Jagatai TurJci, which, at that time, prevailed from the TJlugh-Tagh mountains to the Hindu Kush, and from the Caspian to the Kobi Desert. The period between the death of Timur and that of Baber was the golden age of Turki literature. Baber wrote verses in his native language, and was also well acquainted with the poets of Persia; he was an acute and some times a severe critic of the productions of others; was well skilled in all the rules of prosody; and emulated his kinsman Ulugh Beg, in the study of astronomy and mathematics. Baber was strict in his religious duties as a young man, and was versed in all the orthodox Sunnah traditions of the sage Hanifah. But, while he diligently pursued his studies, the future emperor of India did not neglect the more necessary qualifications of a warrior. Few mea excelled him in the use of the spear, the scimitar, or the bow and arrow; and he loved the fine sport o^ hunting and hawking over the lovely plains o Farganah. Baber's ambition was great, his genius and energyLIFE OF BABEB, 241 were nearly equal to it, and he could not long remain content with his rich little kingdom. In 1497 he collected a small army, and advanced towards Samar kand. His cousin Baisanghar fled at his approach, and took refuge with Khusru, his father's former friend; who, betrayed by the ambition of usurping sovereign power in Kunduz, murdered this accomplished prince, and excited the fierce indignation of the generous BUber. The young king of Farganah took possession of Samarkand, the capital of his mighty ancestor, Timur, in November 1497. He examined with delight the Great Mosque with its 480 pillars, the pleasant gardens by the river Kohik, the observatory of Ulugh Beg, the paper manufactories, the bazars, the country palaces with their minarets and walls overlaid with porcelain from China, and the avenues of plane trees. But all at once treason and rebellion in his own dominions roused him from his pleasant occupation. A Mongol lord, named Ahmed Tumbul, rose in rebel lion, many of B&amp;ber's troops deserted, and the traitors besieged Andekan, which was bravely defended by Khawajah Moulana Khazy, the beloved tutor of the young king. The rebels, on entering Andekan, hung the good old man over the gate of the town. Baber hastily abandoned Samarkand, and advanced as far as Khojend, but most of his troops deserted him, and he was left with only a few personal attendants. ' In this forlorn and destitute plight,' he says, ' I wept very much.' The poor boy was only in his fourteenth year, yet his heart did not fail him; and by the year B r242 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. 1499 he had collected another army, retaken Andekati and TJsh, and forced Tumbul to retreat in great dismay. In June 1550 Baber took Samarkand ; but now his formidable and eventually successful foes, the armies of Uzbegs, appeared on the field, led on by the renowned Shaibany Khan. This chief had already occupied Bukhara, and threatened Samarkand; where Baber remained with his mother and sisters. The Uzbegs inhabiting the deserts north of the Jaxartes had received their name from a chieftain of the house of Jengiz-Khan; but they were the descen dants of those Mongolian warriors who had followed the mighty conqueror to so many victories. Shaibany Khan, who was also of the family of Jengiz, was a leader of considerable ability, and he now led the wild tribes of the desert to the conquest of the rich districts watered by the Jaxartes, the Kohik, and the Oxus. In April 1501 B&amp;ber advanced with his army to oppose the Uzbegs. The two forces remained in sight of each other for several days; but at length the young king became eager to fight on a certain day when the Pleiades would be exactly between the two armies. He afterwards said, that ' this observance was all non sense, and my precipitation was without all solid excuse.' After a well fought battle, he was defeated, and escaped by swimming across the river Kohik with the remainder of his forces; while the Mongols stripped and murdered all the wounded. These iacts of barbarous cruelty excited a fierce feeling of enmity against hisLITE OF BABER. 243 enemies in the breast of the king of Farganah, who was of Turkish race. He exclaimed: Take care not to pluck one ear of corn from a Mongol's harvest— The Mongol seed is such that whatever is sowed with it is execrable. Baber retreated to Samarkand, where he was besieged by Shaibany with a vast army of Uzbegs, and the people were soon reduced to great distress. When all hope was gone, he escaped with his mother and a few followers, but one of his sisters fell into the hands of the conqueror. Nothing is more remarkable in the character of Baber than the buoyant spirit with which he bore misfortune. In the midst of the greatest difficulties and dangers, and when his affairs seemed quite desperate, he never lost heart. His light-hearted cheerfulness never forsook him. No sooner was he out of sight of the fallen city, than he challenged one of his nobles, named Kambar 'Aly, to ride a race with him. The king's horse got the lead, and, turning to see how far his antagonist was behind, his saddle slipped round, and he came right on his head. He did not recover his senses the whole of that eventful day, and all that passed before him was like a dream an'd a phantasy. The little party had been long without any food, and at length they were obhged to kill a horse, and dress slices of its flesh. A few more long marches, however, brought them to the friendly village of Dizak, half dead with hunger. Here they found nice fat flesh, bread well baked, sweet melons, excellent grapes; and Baber exclaimed that in his whole life he never enjoyed himself so much. E 2244 HISTORY OF PERSIA. His affairs were now almost desperate, and he fled to his mother's relation at Tashkend, where he meditated a final retreat to China. Shaibany occupied Samarkand, Tumbul was in rebellion in Farganah, and the exiled prince was deserted by many of those whom he had raised from the dust. After a few unsuccessful attempts to regain Fargkah, and after many wonderful adventures and hair-breadth escapes, he proceeded with a few followers to cross the hills of Asferah, and seek his fortune either in Knnduz or in Mbul. On June 14,1504, his beard first required a razor. On reaching Kunduz, he found Khusru still ruling there, but nearly all his followers deserted to Biiber, and that false traitor was obliged to throw himself on the young prince's mercy. Baber generously allowed him to retire to Khur&amp;s^n, with three strings of mules, laden with his treasure. 1 At this time Kabul was in a state of anarchy and disorder. Biber's uncle, Ulugh Mirza, had died in 1501, and though his son Abdu-'r-Eizzak nominally succeeded, the government was really in the hands of turbulent chieftains. The dethroned king of Farganah, as he had lost his own dominions, boldly resolved to assume the 1 Dow, in his translation of says that' Khusru received Baber very hospitably ; but he made a very bad return, forcing i® to fly, leaving his treasure in the hands of Baber, vol. it • But ' Chosro ' was a traitor and a foul murderer, and Baber rea y acted with the greatest leniency.

Besides his two brothers Jehanghir and Nasir, and his own faithful followers, he was accompanied by most of Khusru's people, who, directly they descended into the plains, began plundering the villagers ; but Baber put a stop to their atrocities by a few very severe examples. It was from the snowy pass of the Hindu Kiish that the northern prince first gazed with rapture on the lovely star Canopus, which seemed to welcome him to the gorgeous south—and to his future empire. In 1504 Kabul capitulated, with all the adjacent country, and Baber once more found himself in pos session of a rich kingdom. His brother, Jehanghir, was made governor of Kabul. The city of Kabul had been enlarged and beautified by Baber's uncle, and was at this time a large and populous place. It is about 6,500 feet above the level of the sea, and surrounded on three sides by hills, but the plain is open towards the east. The citadel of Bala Hissar rises up on a hill on the north side of the town, which is chiefly on the south bank of the river of the same name. The plain of Kabul is very beautiful, well irrigated by little streams, and covered with gardens, 1 1 The gardens of Kabul are tastefully laid out, and well kept; the fmit-trees are planted at regular distances ; most of them rise with the acclivity of the ground in plateaus, or shelves, over one another. There are peaches, plums, apricots, pears, apples, quinces, cherries, walnuts, mulberries, pomegranates, and vines, all growing in one gaiden. There are also nightingales, blackbirds, thrushes, and dovesj. V HISTORY OF PERSIA. which have for ages been renowned for the brilliancy and variety of their flowers. The most delicious fruits are abundant, and Babor added to them by introducing the cherry and plantain. Baber divided the country into torn mis or provinces, which he gave to his followers. His brother JeliangHr had Ghaznah; his youngest brother, Nasir, received the ' Valley of Light,' and other districts; while those officers who had followed him in his most perilous enterprises and worst distresses obtained the govern ment of the villages and small towns. He was accused by the followers of Khusru of partiality for his own Baberians ; and he answered them— What is there enemies will not say ? The gates of a city you may shut, But you cannot shut the mouth of an enemy. to raise their notes, and chatting magpies on almost every tree. The people are passionately fond of sauntering in these gardens, and may be seen flocking to them every evening. The climate of Kabul is most genial. The vines are very plentiful; the grapes are used for wine, as juice in roasting meat, as a powder for pickle (the unripe grapes pounded after drying them), as raisins, and as a syrup. Ehubarb is much eaten. Apricots are the most delicious of the dried fruits of Kabul.— Burnes, vol. ii. p. 130. The valley of Koh Daman, north of Kabul, is separated by a low creeping ridge from the town. At its upper extremity rises the snowy peaks of Hindu Kiish. It is thirty-one miles long and seven broad. It is the favourite country residence of the people o Kabul, and is almost as thickly studded with castles as with gardens. The roads lead by the side of brooks, edged by willow trees; an they are belted by vegetable and fruit gardens. In this valley is Istalaf, which Baber describes as being surrounded by green, gay, and beautiful gardens, irrigated by ice-cold streams, and shaded by spreading plane trees. Here are grapes, apricots, mulberries, wa nuts, almonds, cherries, and plums.—Wood's Oxus, p. 178.LIFE OF BABEE. 247 But though the cities and plains were in the hands of B&amp;ber, the wild hill tribes of Ghilzis and Hazarehs continued to give him constant trouble, and neces sitated frequent expeditions to plunder and chastise them. In January 1505, Baber went forth, for the first time, to invade Hindustan. He descended by the Khaiber Pass into the plain of Peshawur, and crossed the Indus. ' I had never seen the hot region before,' he says. ' It was a new world to me. The grass, the trees, the birds, the wild animals, the manners and customs of the wandering tribes, all were strange and wonderful to me.' The Afghans of Kohat attempted to intercept his march in the passes, but he charged them furiously, put them to flight, and erected a minaret of the skulls of those who were slain. Baber returned to Kabul the same year; and in the month of Muharram his mother was taken ill, and, in spite of the water-melons given her by a physician of Khurasan, she died, and was buried in a garden formed by the late king Ulugh Mirza. She had fol lowed her son in all his vicissitudes of fortune, had always proved a wise and valuable councillor, and Baber mourned her loss long and bitterly. While Btiber was establishing his power at Kabul, Shaibany Khan, with his Uzbeg army, had rapidly extended his conquests, and in 1505 Sultan Husain Mirza, king of Khurasan, formed a league with the new king of Kabul to oppose him. Baber marched with a small force towards Herat, but on the road he heard Qf the death of Husain Mirza, and of the acces--r:!' IMi 248 HISTORY OF PERSIA. sion of his two sons, Muzliaffar and Badiyatu-'z-Zaman, as joint kings. Baber exclaimed against the impolicy of this arrangement, repeating the famous lines of the poet Sa'ady: Ten dervislies may sit on one carpet, But the same climate will not hold two kings. He, however, continued his march to Herat, and was cordially received by the new sovereigns, who enter tained him with prodigal hospitality, and led him into a round of dissipated amusements. They were un skilled in war, and Baber saw no chance of a successful campaign against the Uzbegs, yet he determined to pass the winter of 1506 in his pleasant quarters at Herat. 'Aly Shir Beg, the munificent patron of literature, Jami the poet, and other ornaments of Husain Mirza's court were dead, but many still remained, and Baber made several enduring friendships during his visits, especially with the historian Khondcmir. He also visited the places hallowed as the abodes or the last resting places of the departed great, and devoted much time to seeing the sights of Herat. During his twenty days' stay, he went to all the principal buildings with an excellent cicerone named 'Aly GukuMsh, who had a collection ready for him in some suitable place, when the fatigues of sight-seeing 1 were over for the day. Baber, while at Herat, visited the garden of 'Aly Shir Beg, tlie paper mills, the bridge, the public pleasure grounds, the mausoleum of the poet Jami, the colleges and tomb of Husain Mirza, the white palace built by Abu Sa'id, the mansion of enjoyment, the public market, the bazar, the great reservoir, the Grand Mosque, Aly 111 Beg's tomb, the fish-ponds, the raven garden, the lily palace, &amp;c. «•LIFE OF BABER. 249 But he was led into all kinds of dissipation by the joint kings, and at Herat he was first induced to drink wine, which he liked so much that for many years afterwards scarcely a day passed without his drinking to excess. Badiyatu-'z-Zaman gave him several elegant enter tainments, and it was then that he first indulged in the use of wine. In December 1506 he was suddenly called from the pleasant society of Herat, by the news of a rebellion that had broken out in K^bul. He returned by the mountainous country, with a few followers, and a young lady (daughter of Ahmed Mirza), who had con ceived a strong attachment for him. The party was caught in a terrific snow storm, and the lady, with Baber's followers, took refuge in a cave ; but there was not room for all, and the young prince dug a hole for himself in the snow, saying : 'For me to be in comfort while my men are in the midst of snow and drift, suffering trouble and distress, would be inconsistent with what I owe them, and a deviation from that society in suffering which is their due. A. Persian proverb says, ' Death in the company of friends is a feast.'' Next morning the tempest ceased, but the cold was extreme, and many lost their hands and feet from the frost. On arriving at Kabul, Baber found the country in great disorder; while, soon after his departure, Shaibany Khan occupied Herat, drove out the joint kings, and advanced as far as Kandahar; whence he afterwards retreated.HISTOEY OF PERSIA. In 1507 Babcr assumed the title of ; and in March of the following year, his eldest son, Hnmaiyun, was born. In 1508, the Uzbeg followers of Khusni rose in rebellion, and placed 'Abdu-'r-Eizzak on the throne of Klbul; while Baber fled, with only 500 companions. His cause seemed hopeless, for his enemies had an army of 12,000 men, but he extricated himself by extraordinary personal valour. When the opposing forces approached each other, he rode forward, and challenged 'Abdu-'r-Eizzak to single combat. That young prince declined, but five nobles came forth, and engaged Baber, one after the other. Each fell before the arm of the offended king,, and this ad mirable prowess induced the rebel army to return to its allegiance. 'Abdu-'r-Eizzak received a full pardon, and B&amp;ber found himself, once more, in full possession of Kabul. Amongst the followers of Baber there was a chief of Badakshan named Khan Mirza, whose mother claimed descent from Alexander the Great. At this time he succeeded in driving the Uzbegs out of his country, and sent news to Baber that ShaiMny was dead (having been killed by Isma'il Shah of Persia, in the battle of Merv, 1510), adding, 'Now is the time for recovering Farganah.' Baber, therefore, crossed the Hindu Kush, and joined Khan Mirza at Kunduz, leaving his brother Nasir to govern Kabul in his ab sence. The Shah of Persia sent Baber his sister, who had been captured by ShaiMny at Samarkand, and was released by the Shah at Merv. She gave such anLIFE OF BABEE. 251 account of Isma'il's generosity and goodness to her brother, that he sent ambassadors to Persia ; and re ceived, in return, a large auxiliary force of Persian cavalry, to assist him in the reconquest of Samarkand and Parg&amp;nah. In October 1511, Baber entered Samarkand for the last time, but soon afterwards he was entirely defeated by the Uzbegs, and forced to retreat in great haste. Greater perils yet awaited him. One night a band of conspirators attacked his tent, and he fled naked and alone to the fort of Arik, in Kunduz. Here a handful of faithful followers joined him, and he was glad to eacape over the Hindu Kiish, to Kabul, which he reached in 1514. All hopes were now gone ot ever regaining his paternal inheritance, or of again seeing the old home of his childhood in Farganah. From this time, there fore, he seems to have seriously turned his mind to the conquest of India. In 1518 he crossed the Indus, and conquered the Panjab up to the banks of the Chenab, building a strong fort at Peshawur. But, for several years, he was employed in reducing the wild hill tribes of Afghanistan to order; and preparing for his final invasion of India, which took place in 1525. During these years Baber frequently indulged in excesses. He was wont to go in a boat, on the river of Elbul, with a few choice spirits, and drink wine and sing songs till they were all insensible. He also formed a red granite tank, near Kabul, which he often caused to be filled with wine, and engaged pretty girls to sing and dance round it, while he drank. The fol-252 HISTORY OF PERSIA. lowing lines, in Persian, were engraved on the sides of the tank :—' Sweet the smiling spring. Sweet the juice of the mellow grape. Sweeter far the voice of love. Strive, oh Baber, to secure the enjoyments of life, which, alas! once departed, will never more return.' On the days that he was too ill to drink, he ate maajuns, or intoxicating sweetmeats. The remainder of his time was passed in hunting, making expeditions against the Afghans of the hills, and preparing for the invasion of India. Kandahar fell into his hands in 1522. In November 1525, Baber left Kabul, for his final invasion of Hindustan; and in January 1526, ' placing his foot in the stirrup of resolution, and his hands on the reins of confidence in God,' he advanced against SuMn Ibrahim, in whose possession the throne of Delhi and the dominions of Hindustan then were. This prince was of the Patan or Afghan race, which had reigned in India for several centuries. His army amounted to 100,000 men and 1,000 elephants. 1 In this campaign Baber's young son, Humaiyiin, did 1 Nanac, tBe founder of the Sikh religion, had an interview with Baber in 1526 ; before whom he is said to have defended his doc trine with great firmness and eloquence.

Baber, with a greatly inferior force, encountered the Indian host at the town of Paniput, near Delhi. He was completely victorious ; Ibrahim was killed, and Baber's troops occupied the cities of Delhi and Agra. He passed his first night at Delhi in a boat on the Jumna, drinking wine with some boon companions. At this time five Muhammadan rulers, and two Hindus, exercised sovereignty in India. The Mu- hammadans were the Patan sovereign of Delhi whom B&amp;ber had killed; the Sultans of Gujr&amp;t, the Dekkan, Malwa, and Bengal. The Hindus were the Eajahs of Bij&amp;nagar, 1 in the Dekkan, and of Chanderi, 2 in Malwa, a short distance south of Gwalior; besides the independent Eajput chiefs east of Delhi. Baber had scarcely been a year in possession of Delhi and Agra when a formidable confederacy of Patan Afghans and Hindus was formed against him, led on by the Eajput chief Eana-Sanka; who held the fortress of Chanderi, 2 and had a lame army in the field. 3 The danger was so imminent that Baber renounced the use of wine entirely; but he resolved to fight, and 1 Bijanagar, now a ruined city, was once the capital of a Brahman- ical kingdom.

On April 6, 1527, Ember's little army encountered the vast host of Indians, led on by Eana-Sanka, at a village called Kava, near Agra. His artillery was chained together to resist the charges of cavalry; and his right wing was commanded by his son, Humaiyun. The combined Hindus and Patans were entirely defeated, in spite of their vast superiority in numbers, and Baber proceeded to besiege their stronghold at Chanderi. He took the place by escalade in 1528. The Kajputs, having first killed all their women and children, rushed naked on the swords of the Muslims, until not one soul was left alive. In the follow ing year Baber took Bahar and Oudh, and thus found himself, after many vicissitudes, undisputed Emperor of India. He made a careful survey of the country, established post-houses on the road between K4bul and Agra, and sent Humaiyun to act as his viceroy at Kabul. His last year was passed in improving Agra, and laying out a garden there ; but he sighed for his old home, his beloved Parganah, and complained that the whole country of India was so ugly and detestable that it was difficult to find a place for a garden. 1 He was 1 Writing to his old friend Khawajah Kilan, who was then at Kabul, he says how much he envies his friend, his residence at Kabul, an adds : ' They very recently brought me a single musk melon o Farganah ; while cutting it up I felt myself affected with a strong feeling of loneliness, and a sense of my exile from my native countr), and I could not help shedding tears while I was eating it.LIFE OF BABEE. 255 disgusted, also, with the fawning servility of the natives of India, and even of the Patans, who had been cor rupted by long residence amongst them. In his latter years he became cruel and fanatical, and erected a high pyramid of the skulls of the Pagans, in the Doab. Baber was taken ill at Agra, and died in the Char- Bagli, on December 26,1530, in his forty-eighth year. 1 He left four sons, Humaiyun, who succeeded him, Kamr&amp;n, Hindal, and Askeri. 2 This illustrious prince was above the middle size, an excellent swordsman, and a skilful archer. He was so strong that he often, in sport, went leaping along from one pinnacle to another of the pinnated ramparts used in the East, with a man under each arm, and double-soled boots on. 3 His mind was as 1 B^ber was buried about a mile from Kabul, in a lovely spot. The grave is marked by two erect slabs of white marble in a small garden. A running stream still waters the fragrant flowers of this cemetery, which is the great holiday resort of the people of Kabul. In front of the grave there is a small but chaste mosque of marble; and an inscription upon it sets forth that it was built in the year 1640, by Shah Jehan, 4 that poor Muhammadans might offer up their prayers.' There is a noble prospect from the hill which over looks Baber's tomb, and a summer-house has been erected upon it by Shah Zaman, from which it may be admired. It presents a plain, about twenty miles in circumference, laid out with gardens and fields in pleasing irregularity, intersected by three rivulets, which wind through it by a serpentine course, and wash innumer able little forts and villages.

Baber was undaunted under difficulties, of a gay disposition, and affectionately attached to his relations and early friends. He was a prince of great hu manity, as all truly brave men are; and carried his generosity to such an excess that he almost always pardoned ingratitude and treason, and seemed to make a principle of rendering good for evil. He was a strict Sunnah in religion, of the sect of Abu-Hanifah, but until the last few years of his life he was tolerant to other sects. He was a master in the arts of poetry, writing, and music; and his Memoirs, which he wrote during the latter part of his life, is one of the most interesting works in Eastern literature. Besides giving minute details of all the principal events of his life, and many particulars respecting his contemporaries, it abounds in original reflections, and most entertaining remarks on the weaknesses of those around him ; and contains many descriptions of the countries he visited, especially of India.

The descendants of Baber reigned in India for two centuries and a half. His son, Humaiyun, was driven out by an insurrection of Patans in 1540, and was received with courteous hospitality by the Shah of Persia. 1 In fifteen years he had recovered Kabul from his brothers Askeri and Kamran, and India from the Patans; and he passed the last years of his life in the pious labour of transcribing the whole of his father's Memoirs. His son Akbar, the most illustrious of the descen dants of Baber, who was famous alike for his en lightened toleration and legislative wisdom succeeded him in 1556. Akbar died in 1605 ; and from that time we would feign draw a veil over the history of the house of Timur, The three immediate successors of Akbar, ! f 1 Humaiyun fell in love with a young lady, when beyond the Indus, whom he saw with his stepmother (his brother Hindal's mother).

Humaiyun had, by Hamida, his renowned son, the Emperor Akbar, who was born during his father's flight through Sindh, in the fort of Amercot, on October 15, 1542. Akbar is said to have been born under a tree called Arkari Kowi or Arka, an asclepiad (Calotropis giganteo).

JeMnghir (1605-27), SMh-Jehan (1627-58), and Aurungzib (1658-1707), retained great power; but it was bought at the price of endless crimes, and the two latter murdered nearly all their male relations. From the death of Aurungzib they became con temptible as well as cruel. Escaping, through their submissive cowardice, the whirlwinds of Nadir, of Ahmed Shah, and of the Mahrattas, they subsequently continued to receive an enormous pension, granted by the generosity of the British Government; until, adding treason to their other crimes, in 1857, they will at last disappear from history—unheeded and un- pitied. It is very melancholy that such should be the end of the posterity of the illustrious Baber. Well would it have been if the members of the house of Timur had fallen fighting bravely against the army of Nadir, on the field of Kurnal. A more satisfactory end would it have been if they had even dared to stand in the breach at Delhi in 1857, and thus terminated their career, on the avenging bayonets of outraged Britain. But it is a sad and pitiable end for the posterity of Baber to be executed as felons, or to drag out a dis graced existence as criminal exiles. 1 1 Fate of the House of TIm^r. Twenty-six members of the Delhi royal family were executed after the Mutinies; fifteen died after arrest; thirteen were sent to jail at Agra, under sentence of imprisonment, there being a strong presumption that they shared the feelings which animated their family. They were afterwards ordered to be released, to join the king at Eangoon, on ten rs. a month each. This destination, however, was altered, and they were ordered to be divided between Mulrnein and Karachi.FATE OF THE HOUSE OF TIMUR. 259 The king was sent to Eangoon. Mirza Nazim Shah, the king's brother, was sent to Mulmein. Those who were to have gone to Karachi were sent by mistake to Calcutta, whence they were forwarded to Akyab, to be kept under surveillance. The number of the members of the family was, in 1859, exclusive of concubines, 623 : 171 males, 820 females related by blood, and 132 by marriage. About 650 other members were alive before the Mutiny, of whose fate nothing is known. They are not to be searched for, as the sooner they are mixed up with the general population the better. Of the 171 males, of 24 nothing is known, 34 are recom mended for pensions, of whom 10 are clearly guiltless of complicity in the rebellion, to 11 subsistence is allowed, if they reside at Kara chi or Mulmein, 5 have absconded. There are also 57 who re ceive subsistence allowance, and 51 who have declined it, because they did not wish to comply with the conditions on which alone they were to receive it. The subsistence allowance is 5 rs. a month, 155 of the females receive, and 159 have declined this allowance. A donation of 50 rs. is given to girls on their marriage ; and subsis tence for boys only so long as they are destitute, and unable to provide for themselves.

B 2261 CHAPTEE X. the sufawi dynasty. Shah ImcCil toAbhas The most interesting and romantic part of the history of the rise of Islamism is, without doubt, the life of 'Aly, and the tragic ends of his two sons, Husain and Hasan; 1 and from the periods of their deaths there has always been a sect which mourned their misfortunes, venerated their descendants, and hated the usurpers of their power. The many fine and noble qualities of 'Aly ; the fact of his having been, when quite a boy, the first of Muhammad's converts; his near relationship to the Prophet; and his subsequent misfortunes, were all calculated to enlist the sympathies of every generous mind in his favour. This feeling was heightened by the persecutions and martyrdoms which were suffered by his descendants. On the death of 'Aly in 661, his son Hasan, though deprived of the Khalifate by Mu'awiyah, the founder of the dynasty of the Omeyyahs, was allowed to retain the spiritual dignity of Im&amp;ra. But he was poisoned by a woman bribed by the Khalifah Yezld, son of Mu'&amp;wiyah; and his brother Husain having collected a small force to regain his rights, was surrounded by the overwhelming 1 See page 109i262 HISTORY OF PERSIA. numbers of Yezid's army, on the arid plains of Kerbela, near the Euphrates. After seeing all his friends and relations killed around him; the unfortunate Husain was slain, his head was cut off and sent to the Khalifah at Damascus, and his body was buried on the spot where he fell. A sacred shrine, annually resorted to by crowds of Persian pilgrims, now stands over his remains at Ker bela ; and his head is buried in another mosque at Cairo. The followers of what is called the Shia'ah sect curse the memories of Abu-Bekr, 'Omar, and 'Othman, whom they look upon as usurpers of Aly's rights; and they despise the Sunnah or body of traditions collected during their reigns, which are venerated by all orthodox Muhammadans. They almost worship the twelve holy Imams or successors of 'Aly, who all suffered martyrdom, except 'el-Mahdy, the last, and he is said to have disap peared mysteriously, and is believed still to be alive. The twelve Imams are: 1. 'Aly, the son-in-law of Muhammad. 2. Hasan, 'I IIis 6011S . 3. Husain, J 4. Zainu-l'-Abidin. Put to death by the Khalifah Walid I. 5. Muhammad el-Bakir.

They hate and execrate the memories of Abu-Bekr, 'Omar, 'Othman, and all the Khalifahs who deprived the twelve Imams of their indefeasible right to be the successors, as they were the descendants, of Muhammad. In the days of Timftr, the great conqueror, there lived at Ardebil in Azerbaijan, a descendant of Muza Kazhim, the seventh Imam, named Shaikh Safy-ud-Din Ishak, whose fame for sanctity was spread abroad throughout all Persia. Timur is said to have paid a visit to this holy man, and asked him what favour he should grant him. ' Eelease those tribes you have brought into captivity,' said the descendant of 'Aly. The grateful tribes, who were of Turkish origin, and had been transported into Syria and Armenia, declared themselves his devoted disciples, and their children became the supporters of his family. 1 1 History,' says Sir John Malcolm, ' does not furnish us with a better motive for obedience, or a nobler origin of power.' The two immediate descendants of Safy-ud-Dln, named Sadru-'d-Din and Khawajah 'Aly, retained the great reputation of the family for sanctity, and the latter visited Mekkah, and died at Jerusalem. His son, Junaid, married a sister of Uzun Hasan, the chief of the Ak Kuyunlu (' White Sheep ') tribe, then ruler of 1 Among them were the Kajar®, ancestors of the reigning dynasty of Persia.264 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Persia; and by her had a son named SuMn Haidar, who became a warrior, as well as a Saint and a S6fy philosopher. Junaid had been put to death by the king of Shirvan, and Sultan Haidar invaded that province to avenge him, but was killed in battle and interred under a mosque in his native city of Ardebil. His wife was named Martha, and was a daughter of Uzun Hasan, by the Christian lady, Despina, daughter of Calo Johannes, Emperor of Trebizond. The number of pilgrims who, excited by the fame of the sanctity of this family of saints, flocked to Ardebil, excited the jealousy of Yakub, a son of Uzun Hasan, who then ruled in Persia. He, therefore, on the death of Sultan Haidar, seized upon his three sons, and confined them in a fort at Persepolis. On Yakub's death they escaped ; but the two eldest fell in skirmishes with their persecutors, and the youngest, then quite a child, was allowed to remain at Ardebil. His name was Isma'il, the founder of the powerful Sufawi dynasty; and in 1492, at the age of fourteen, the future monarch had established an independent government at Ardebil, and collected an army sufficiently large to defy the power of the prince of the Ak Koyunlu tribe, who then ruled over Persia. The town of Ardebil, in Azerbaijan, is situated in a large plain surrounded by mountains, and in its neigh bourhood are the famous plains of Mogan, which extend to the shores of the Caspian Sea. The streets of Ardebil are crooked, dirty, and uneven, but rivuletsSHAH ISMA'iL. 265 abounding in excellent trout are led through them, and the surrounding country is fertile. 1 Having consolidated his power at Ardebil, young Isma'il defeated Alwung Beg, a son of Yakub, and conquered the whole province of Azerbaijan. The following year he invaded 'Mk, and having entirely defeated Murad KMn, another Ak Koyunlu prince, near Hamadan, that dynasty was overthrown. In less than four years the victorious Ismail was acknowledged as sovereign of the whole of Persia, and was proclaimed Shah in the year 1499 a.d . He was styled Shiaan, or ' King of the Shia'ahs.' Isma'il proclaimed the doctrine of the Shia'ah sect to be the religion of Persia ; the sacred memory of Aly and Husain soon became the chief tenet in the faith of the children of Iran ; and was the cause of the consoli dation of the discordant elements which then formed the population of Persia, under a native and powerful dynasty.

Pietro della Yalle was a Roman of good family. After travelling for^ some years in Mesopotamia, and Northern Persia, he came to Shiraz, with the intention of visiting India. But he found the Persians and English besieging the Portuguese at Ormuz. He, therefore, took up his abode at Minav, where he remained for some months in 1621-2. Here he lost his beloved wife Maani (a Nes- torian Christian), whom he had married at Baghdad. The story of his wife and her horse Dirviseh, is interspersed with a variety of pathetic incidents, painted with the romantic gallantry of an Italian lover.

The population of Persia, which became subject to Shah Ismail, had been much changed in character during the eight hundred years of the domination of TArSn. The seven grateful Turkish tribes, who had assisted Isma'il in his rise to power, were honoured with a peculiar dress and a red cap, whence they received the name of Kuzil-bdsh, ' golden head,' and their chiefs became the most powerful nobles at court. These tribes or Ilydts were named: Ustajalft Bah arid Shamlft Zhu-'l-Khudair Nikalu Kajar Afshar. But, besides the Kuzil-Msh tribes, a great proportion of the inhabitants of Persia now consists of Ilyats, or tribes, who are nearly all of foreign origin. Mr. Morier says that, until the conquest of Persia by the Saracens, her people may be said to have been un mixed ; but afterwards, during the successive inroads of Mongols, Turks, and Arabs, many tribes remained in the conquered country. 1 These tribes are classed as nisMn, or ' dwellers in cities,' and Sahrd nishm, or ' dwellers in the field.' The latter are the most warlike and powerful, their 1 Morier, in the Koyal Geographical Society's Journal, vol. vii.SHAH ISMA'iL. 267 wealth consisting of flocks and herds. They lead a wild and roving life, living entirely in tents, and moving each year from their kisldk, or winter quarters, to the yailak or summer pastures. These tribes are governed by a chief called Reis-Safid, ' White Beard,' and from their ranks, the cavalry—the most powerful arm of a Persian army—is supplied. The infantry was chiefly raised from the dwellers in cities and cultivated districts. Next to the Kuzil-bashes, the most numerous and important of the tribes were the Bakhtiyaris and Feilis, who inhabit the Zagros Chain and the mountains of Luristan. They are a wild, untutored, and almost independent people, but are possessed of many fine qualities, and their monuments testify to the affectionate feelings of their women. Whitewashed obelisks of brick work are to be seen in all directions on the skirts of the hills—sepulchral monuments of the tribes of Luristan. Most of them are decorated with a coronal of woman's tresses; it being the custom on the death of a chieftain for his female relations to cut off their hair, and weave it into a funeral wreath upon the tomb of their departed lord. Sir Henry Eawlinson, when travelling through their country, inquired from a peasant the history of one of these monuments. 'A chief from Pish-kuh,' he answered, ' was betrothed to the daughter of one of our Tushmah; ('chief of a village'). 'He came to celebrate his nuptials, but sickened on the road, and died before he reached the encampment of his bride.268 HISTOEY OF PEESTA. The maiden raised this pillar to his memory; and shaving her long tresses, hung them round the obelisk in token of her grief.' The Bakhtiyaris supplied splendid bodies of cavalry to the armies of the Shah, and in after times (after the death of Nadir) one of their chiefs aspired to the throne of Persia. All the tribes of Luristan belong to the great family of Leks, a people of pure Persian extrac tion. The other tribes, except some Arabian septs, settled in KhuriMn, are of Turkish extraction. The Karaguslis, near Hamadan, supplied the best infantry to the SMh's army. Such was the population over which Shah Ismail now began to reign, and several years were employed in establishing his power on a firm basis. But he had numerous enemies on his frontiers. Shaibany Khan, the founder of the power of the Uzbegs beyond the Oxus, having driven Baber out of Farganah, defeated the sons of SuMn Husain Mirza, the last reigning prince of the house of Timur, and conquered Herat; proceeded to overrun the Persian province of Khurasan. Shah Ismail sent him a courteous message, requesting him to desist from his unprovoked invasion; but the haughty conqueror, flushed with success, replied that ' If Shah Isma'il had suffered any diminution of his paternal possessions, it was a very easy matter to restore them entire to him ;' at the same time sending back the staff and wooden begging dish of a mendicant. The SMh sent back a spindle and a reel, giving him to understand that words were woman's weapons; but heSHAH ISMA'lL. 269 followed rapidly with an army of his faithful Kuzil- bashes, and entirely defeated the Uzbegs at Merv. Shaibany himself was killed in an attempt to escape. From that time until it was sacked by the king of Bukhara in 1787, the old town of Merv enjoyed great prosperity, but that barbarian demolished its canals and sold the people for slaves, and it has since been sterile and desolate. 1 From the ruined castle Burnes saw a circle of thirty miles covered with deserted villages and decayed walls. A few melon fields, on the banks of the Miirghab, are alone cultivated by the Turkman inhabitants. After his victory. Shah Isma'il found among his captives a sister of Baber, afterwards the founder of the empire of the Great Moguls in India. She had been taken prisoner by Shaibany ten years before, when he captured the city of Samarkand. Baber, in his charming Memoirs, gives the following account of her restoration to her family : 4 When Shah Isma'il defeated the Uzbegs at Merv, my sister was in the town. Out of regard for me, he paid her every attention, and caused her to be conduc ted in the most honourable manner to me, at Kunduz. We had been separated for ten years, and I went out to meet her. She, and her attendants did not know me 1 Ancient Merv was in a plain watered by a canal from the Miirghab. The present Merv is an assemblage of about 100 mud huts on the MCirghab. The entire waters of that river are dispersed over the sandy plain for purposes of irrigation. The plain is about sixty miles long, by forty. The trade passing through is very considerable, from Bukhara, Persia, Khiva, and Herat.—Abbott's Khiva.270 HISTORY OF PERSIA. even after I had spoken, but in a short time she recog nised me.' Baber, in return, sent an embassy to the Shah with rich presents, congratulating him on his victory. Having added KhurHsiln to his dominions, Ismail marched to Herat, where the gates were opened to him; and he was guilty of cruel persecution in an attempt to force the inhabitants to adopt the Shia'ah doctrine. In the year 1514 Salim I., Sultan of Turkey, declared war against Persia. Isma'il, with an army of only 30,000 men, advanced to the town of Khoi in Azer baijan, about 90 miles from Tabriz, where he awaited the approach of the invaders. His army was com posed almost entirely of cavalry of the Kuzil-Msh tribes; while the formidable array of the Ottoman army was made up of cavalry, infantry, and artillery. The Persians had never yet seen, or even heard of this new method of destruction. Shah Isma'il encountered Salim at the head of 200,000 Turks. The town of Khoi, a favourite residence of the Sufawi kings, is in a rich and well wooded plain, bounded by a finely broken range of hills. The plain is covered with corn-fields, orchards and melon grounds, inter spersed with lofty groves of chenar-trees. Here the two armies encountered each other; but the Turks, besides their vast superiority in numbers, had a for midable train of artillery. ' It was in vain that the brave SMh, with a blow of his sabre, severed a chain with which the Turkish guns were fastened together to resist the shock of the Persian cavalry ;' 1 Isma'il was forced to retreat, and 1 Colonel Stewart's Jo pp. 126-8.SHlH ISMA'IL. 271 it is said that he never smiled again. It was the only time he was ever defeated; and the reverse was chiefly owing to Salim's artillery, a means of destruction that had then been but recently introduced into Asiatic warfare. But on the death of Salim in 1519 the Shah con quered Georgia. Isma'il died at Ardebil; whither he had gone on a pilgrimage to his father's tomb, in the year 1523. Shah Isma'il, like many of his ancestors, was a Sftfy philosopher. He was a brave and generous prince, and possessed many estimable qualities besides those which are almost invariably found in the first sovereign of an Eastern dynasty. Shah Isma'il Sufy was succeeded by his son Tah- masp I., who was ten years of age in 1523. Only two years after his accession the young SMh was involved in a war with the Khan of the Uzbegs, whom he defeated near Mash-had in 1527, driving the invaders out of Khurasan; and in 1530 he forced these Uzbegs to raise the siege of Herat. The early part of the reign of Tahmasp was dis turbed by the feuds of the Shamlu and Tukulu, two of the most powerful of the Kuzil-bash tribes, the latter desiring to have the custody of the SMh's person: but Tahmasp settled the question by a sudden attack on the Tukulu, who were dispersed. In 1532 he was engaged in an indecisive war with Sulaiman, SuMn of Turkey ; and in 1534 'Obaid Khan, with an army of Uzbegs, succeeded in capturing Herat. During the whole of the reign of Tahmasp, the province of Khu-HISTORY OF PERSIA. rasan was subjected to periodical invasions from the Uzbegs and Turkmans. About this time Shah Tahmasp appointed Pir Budah Khan Kajar Governor of Kandahar. This is the first mention, in history, of a chief of the tribe of Kajar, which now boasts the reigning dynasty of Persia amongst its number. The reign of Sluili Tahmasp is chiefly famous for his reception of Humaiyun, the son and successor of Baber, when he was driven out of India. The Persian sovereign treated him with the most generous hospi tality, and gave him an asylum for several years, until he was at length enabled to re-establish his power in India. In the year 1561 Mr. Anthony Jenkinson arrived in Persia with a letter from Queen Elizabeth of England to the Shah ; whom she styles—' The right mightie and right victorious prince, the great Sophie, Emperor of the Persians, Medes, Parthians, Hyrcanians, Cara- manians, Margians, of the people this side and beyond the river Syris, and of all men and nations between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf.' Though Jenkinson was courteously received, his mission did not lead to any permanent result. Shah Tahmasp died in 1576, at the age of 64 ; and his fifth son, named Haidar Mirza, immediately pro claimed himself king. It was the custom, at this time, to commit the king's sons to the custody of the power ful Kuzil-bash chiefs. The Ustajalu chief had charge of Haidar Mirza, and the Afshar espoused the cause of another son, named Isma'il.'ABBAS THE GREAT. 273 Haidar was slain before his friends could rally round him, and Isma'il became Shah of Persia. He was a debauched and wicked tyrant. Muhammad Mirza, the eldest son of Tahmasp, had been set aside on account of a weakness in his eyes, but his son 'Abb4s, then a child, had been left as nominal Governor of Khurasan, under the tutelage of a chief named 'Aly Kuly Khan. On the death of his wicked uncle Isma'il, in 1577, the incapable father was set aside after a few years, and yo king 'Abbas was proclaimed Shah of Persia by the nobles of Khurasan, at Nishapur. In the year 1585 he found himself in peaceable possession of the whole of Persia. He became the greatest sovereign that Persia had known for many centuries, and is known in history as AbMs the Great, After punishing the Uzbegs, under 'Abdu- 1-Mumin Khan in 1587, who had sacked Herat and Mash-had, the young Sh&amp;h was engaged in a war with the Turks in Georgia. 'Abbas led his army to the banks of the Araxes; and some Turkish officers came to one side of the river, while the ShSih and his officers happened to be standing on the other. The Turks, not knowing who he was, invited him to cross and partake of their hospitality. 'AbMs went at once, and was well entertained. On taking leave, he gave them an in vitation in return, and they answered, ' We will attend you with pleasure, as we expect you will contrive to obtain us a glance at your young monarch, whose T274 HISTOKY OF PEESIA. fame is already far beyond his years.' 'Abbas smiled ; and when the Turks arrived they soon discovered who was their host, and returned loaded with presents. His Turkish war over, 'AbMs again attacked the Uzbegs under Talim Khan, and entirely defeated them near Herat in 1597. From that time KhurMn had a respite from these incessant inroads until after the death of 'Abbas. That wise monarch effectually checked them by planting colonies of warlike Kurdish horsemen on the frontier; especially along what is called the Ddman-i-Koh, or ' skirt,' to the north of the Atrak valley. He also posted a portion of the Kajar tribe at Merv. In 1604 the Shah attacked the Turks, who still retained several conquests in Azerbaijan and Georgia. He retook Tabriz and Erivan, and, having defeated the enemy in a great battle, the whole of the provinces of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Diabekr, and Baghdad, were restored to Persia; and shortly afterwards Kandahar was wrested from the Great Mogul. In the meanwhile, to make his power more secure, and to suppress the insolence of the Kuzil-Mshes, who threatened to become another Praetorian Guard, he put several of their chiefs to death; and formed a tribe of his own, called Shah ' King's Friends,' which soon became very numerous, and was always loyal to the Sufavean dynasty. He also, to be the more independent of the Kuzil-Mshes, formed a corps of 10,000 horse and 12,000 foot, exclusively under his own orders. These soldiers were called'ABBAS THE GREAT, 275 or ' slaves of the King,' which is considered an honor able title in Persia. SMh 'Abb^s fixed his capital at Isfahan. The city is situated in a fine plain, almost surrounded by mountains, and the river Zainder-Eud runs past it, whence pipes convey water to the houses. 'Abb^s the Great elevated Isfahan to the rank of one of the most famous cities in Asia. The Great Mosque, the noble palace of Setun, the avenues and palaces of the Char Bdgh, and the bridge over the Zainder-Eud were all built or planted by Abbas. In the time of its splendour, Isfahan was twelve miles round, and possessed 150 mosques, many public baths, and spacious squares. Several of the streets were arched over. The Maidan, or Eoyal Square, was a third of a mile long. At the south end was the Great Mosque, two other sides were occupied with shops, and there was a market in the centre. On the re maining side stood the palace, with a fine row of trees, and a running stream in front. Inside the palace gate, on the left, was the hall where the Wazir administered justice. Thence there was a handsome walk to the audience hall, a long room painted and gilded, and supported by forty pillars. At the further end was the royal throne, on which was spread a rich brocade carpet. There were many other halls ; and delicious pleasure-grounds, with fountains and cascades, were attached to the harem. 1 1 The architecture of the Sufluvi kings, at Isfahan, is des cribed by Mr. Pergusson.— History vol. ii. p. 439.276 HISTOKY OF PERSIA. A walk a mile long, called the led from the city to the river Zainder-Eud, with double rows of trees on each side, and in the centre a canal lined with hewn stones, which, at every furlong, fell into a basin and formed a cascade. On either side of the avenue there were gardens and pleasure-houses. At the end was a bridge, with a very high arch, leading to Julfa, a large suburb of Isfahan, inhabited entirely by Arme nians, Georgians, and other foreigners; who were encouraged and protected by the enlightened policy of Shah Abbas. 1 The river Zainder-Eud rises in the mountains of Zardah-Kuh, flows past Isfahan, and after a short course loses itself in irrigation. On the opposite side of the Zardah-Kuh range, the much larger river Karun rises, and falls into the Persian Gulf. Shah 'Abbas formed the magnificent design of cutting through the mountain, and bringing the united waters of the Zainder-Eud and Karun to his capital. He com menced the undertaking, but it was not completed at his death, and the remains of his work, now called Kor Kdnun, may still be seen. The SMh also frequently held his court at Kazwin, near the feet of the Elburz Mountains. This town is situated in a plain, with the high and snow -covered range in full view on the north. For two miles, on 1 Chardin. The best account of IsfaMn, in the time of the Snfaveans, is by Sir John Chardin. He was a French gentleman who fled to England on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, being a Protestant. He was knighted by Charles II., and died in 1712. He first left Paris for the East in 1671, and was for some time a jewel merchant in Persia. On his return he published his travel '.'ABBAS THE GREAT. 277 every side, it is surrounded by vines planted in deep parallel trenches, and resting on the sunny slopes of the intermediate banks. The mosque has a glazed blue dome, and two high minarets ; and an avenue of shady elm-trees leads to the gate of the palace. But the favourite residence of Shah 'Abbas was the beautiful mountainous province of Mazanderan, which borders the southern coast of the Oaspian Sea. He carried a causeway across the whole of the province from Keshar, on the south-west corner of the Caspian, to beyond Astrabad, near 300 miles ; thus rendering this difficult country passable for armies and travellers at all seasons. Some parts of this causeway are twenty yards wide, with pavement and a ditch on each side. There are many bridges on it, under which water is conveyed to the rice-fields; and from Aliabad to Sari there are groves of thick woods on each side, whose luxuriant branches afford a delightful shelter. The Shah threw bridges over most of the rivers in Persia, and erected solid and spacious caravanserais or inns, at intervals on the roads. He delighted greatly in the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, and erected a palace at Ashraf in Mazan- deran. Over the outer gate a sun and lion were carved^ to represent the splendour and power of Iran. On passing it there was a long avenue, with thirty apart ments for the royal guards on each side. The next gate opened on a garden, in the middle of which was a channel of running water, paved with stones. The garden consisted of walks, bordered by large pines.-L- 278 HISTORY OF PERSIA. orange and other fruit trees, with streams running between them. In front of this garden was the great banqueting hall, hung with pictures; and there were numerous other halls and apartments, with pleasure- grounds attached to them. The whole commands a view of a very fine country, with the Caspian five miles distant, while lofty mountains rise up behind the palace. 1 This was the favourite abode of Shah 'AbMs. His government was quite despotic. His word was law, and his frequent acts of cruelty only prove how unfit any human being is, let his merits be ever so great, to wield such unlimited power. In practice, however, a pure despotism was tempered by the laws of the Kuran, or the written law, called in Persian ' Shirah,' which is administered by learned doctors in the Shara' Court. Sh^h Isma'il established the office of Sadru-'s-Sudur, or Chief Pontiff of Persia. He was also called Nawab, in allusion to his office as Vicar of the Imam el-Mahdy, until he again appears. The lands with which the mosques were endowed produced a great revenue to this dignitary. Next in religious dignity came the Mujt-dhids, ' givers of evidence,' of whom there were seldom more than three or four. They were also very learned and holy men, and great authorities on the Shia'ah doctrine. The Shaikh ' Chief of the Faith,' was the supreme chief of the Shara' Court. There was one in every great city, nominated by the Shah, and enjoying a good salary. He is assisted by 1 Travels of Jonas Hanway.ABBAS THE GREAT. 279 another judge called Kddhi, and a council of Mullahs^ or learned doctors; while the Mufti prepares an ex position of the case before the Court; but is not a judge. In the small towns there is only a Kadhi to administer the Shara'; and in villages a Mullah suffices. But, besides the ' Shirah/ or law of the Kuran, there is a system of customs, amounting to laws, in every province, which is administered by secular magistrates in a Court called 'Irf. Sir John Chardin says that without the 'Irf, no person, not a Muslim, could carry on any commercial transactions, as the bigotry of the priests of the Sh^ra' tribunal, and the strict letter of the Kuran, would deprive them of any hope of justice. Under the Shah and his Ftimadu-d-Daulah, or Prime Minister, the Beglar Begs^ or Governors of Provinces, were at the head of the civil authority. The Kalandar was chief magistrate of a city, and under him were the Hakim, or governors, and Daroghas, or lieutenants of police. The heads of villages were called Ket-Khuddhs, and Rdis in the Arabian districts. There were two kinds of marriages, the one recog nized by the Kuran, by which a man is allowed to have four wives ; and the other called Zijah, confined to Persia, and looked upon with abhorrence by the Simnis. By the Zijah the duration of the marriage is limited, it may be for a day, or a year, or twenty years; but the number of wives of this kind is un limited. The offspring are considered legitimate, but hold an inferior position to those children who are born by a marriage according to Muhammadan law.280 HISTORY OF PEESTA. The religious festivals are an important feature in Persian life. At the festival of Nau-ranz, or New Year's Day, it is the custom for all the Governors to send presents to the SMh. The first ten days of the month Muhdrram, the first of the year, is then passed in mourning for the death of Husain. At this time there are usually dramatic representations called Tdziyah, in -which the whole tragedy is acted over again, and the people are worked up to a fearful pitch of religious excitement. On the 20th of the month So far, which comes next to there is a festival to celebrate the burial of Husain's head; and during the month of Ramadhdn it is well known that all Muhammadans are bound to fast from sunrise to sunset. On the 10th of Eamadhan the death of Aly is celebrated as a day of mourning. One of the wisest acts of the SMh Abbas was the turning of the tide of Persian pilgrims .from the shrines of Mekkah and Kerbela to the more truly national one at Mash-had, a city which he made the capital of Khuras&amp;n. The holy Imam Eazha had suffered mar tyrdom, and was buried there, and by encouraging pilgrimages to his grave the SMh succeeded in retain ing all the overflowings of religious zeal within his own dominions. The city of Mash-had had been sacked by the Uzbegs in 1587 ; but ten years afterwards 'Abbas the Great raised it to a high state of prosperity as the Holy City, which contained the body of the IrMm Eazha. The city is surrounded by a dry ditch and a mud wall, and is situated in the centre of a vast plain between'ABBAS THE GREAT. 281 two mountain ranges. On the south-east side of the town is the citadel, an oblong with large towers at the angles, and smaller ones connected by curtains. A magnificent avenue, called the planted with rows of fine plane trees and having a large stream of running water flowing through its centre, traverses the whole length of the city, from one end to the other. The Great Mosque, which is annually resorted to by thousands of pilgrims, is by far the finest building in the city. It is divided into two parts, the first being a large square court, where the devotees are lodged It is paved with flag stones, and the walls are covered with blue tiles, on which there are verses of the Kurati in gold letters. The second division of the mosque covers the remains of the Imam Eazha, which are deposited in a marble tomb decorated with arabesques and surrounded by a massive silver railing. The whole building is surmounted by a large cupola and two elegant minarets, covered with rich gilding. Kum was another holy city, and almost in the very centre of Persia. It is situated in an extensive plain, on the road from Isfahan to Tehran, 1 and on the banks of a small stream which afterwards loses itself in the Great Salt Desert to the eastward. Here was a mosque containing the body of F&amp;timah, a sister of the Imam Eazha, and thus attracted numerous devout pilgrims. By the wise policy of 'Abbas all the wealth, which naturally follows the track of great bodies of devotees, was retained in Persia, and spent in the cities of Mash-had 1 80' from Tehran.282 HISTORY OF PERSIA. and Kiim, instead of forming a constant drain towards Syria and Arabia. In his foreign relations 'Abbas displayed as much wisdom as in his home policy. After the conquest of Kandahar, he maintained constant amicable relations with the Great Mogul, and allied himself with the English, Spanish, Dutch, and French Governments. In 1598 Sir Anthony and Eobert Shirley, two English gentlemen, arrived at the SMh's court at Kazvin, with a numerous retinue. They were well received, and after some months, Sir Anthony returned to Europe with credentials to several Christian princes. Eobert, with five Englishmen, remained at the court of the Shah. He married a Circassian lady named Teresia, and in 1607 was sent by 'AbMs as his ambassador to James I. of England. After travelling through Europe, and remaining a long time at Madrid, Sir Eobert Shirley and his Cir cassian wife landed in his native country in 1611, and was received by James I. with every respect, as the ambassador of a powerful sovereign. His object was to open a trade between England and Persia, but he did not meet with success, owing to the opposition of the Levant merchants. He sailed from Dover with his wife in 1613, and after visiting the court of the Great Mogul, reached IsfaMn in 1615. He was, soon after wards, sent as ambassador to Spain, where he remained until 1622, and in the spring of that year Vandyke painted his portrait at Eome, in the Persian costume. This curious picture is still preserved at Petworth. In 1618, while Shirley was residing at Madrid, the'ABBAS THE GBEAT. 283 government of Pliilip III. of Spsiin sent sn emb^issy to Persia, at the head of which was Don Garcia de Silva y Figueroa, an able and learned diplomatist, who made good use of his time in collecting information, and in writing a detailed account of his mission and of Persia, including a Life of Timlir. 1 Garcia de Silva landed at Ormuz, and proceeded thence to Shiraz, where he was most hospitably entertained. The ambassador was forwarded to Kazwin in June, and had an audience of the SMh, who received him very graciously. Many conversations afterwards took place between 'AbMs and the stately Spaniard, touching Spanish victories over the Turks, and other matters of state. But the main object of the embassy, namely security for Ormuz which was now, through the absorption of Portugal, a Spanish possession, was not obtained. Garcia de Silva returned home by way of Aleppo, and embarked at Tripoli for France, on November 12, 1619; devoutly 1 The Life of Timur, by Garcia de Silva, forming the fifth book of his voluminous work on Persia, is printed in the same volume with the Cronica de Don Pedro Nino (Sancha, Madrid, 1782). The remainder is still in manuscript. Purchas (vol. ii.) gives a letter from Silva to the Marquis of Bedma (Bedmar), written from Isfahan in 1619. Spaniards had become acquainted with Persian affairs through the publication of a very curious, and now very scarce work, four teen years before the mission of Garcia de Silva. It appears that an educated Persian came to Spain in the beginning of the 17th century, and was baptised with the name of 1 Juan.' He was known as * Don Juan de Persia/ and in 1604 he published a history of his native country, with the following title :— Relaciones de Don Juan de Persia (tres lihros); las cosas notahles de Persia, genealogia de sus reyes, guerras de Persianos y Turcos, su conversion, (Valla- dolid, 1604.) 8vo. 173 pages.284 HISTORY OF PERSIA. praying that his friend the Shah might be victorious over the Grand Turk. In the meanwhile Shah 'Abbas was occupied in establishing and regulating the important trade of the Persian Gulf. Lar, a mountainous province, had pre viously been completely subdued; and Pars was ruled by Imam Kiily Khan, 1 one of the SMh's most trusty and faithful servants. He kept his court at Shiraz with such magnificence, that 'Abbas ordered him to spend one dirhem a year less, that there might be some difference between their expenditures. 2 In 1622 the SMh determined on the expulsion of the Portuguese from the Persian Gulf. They had seized upon the Isle of Ormuz in 1507, under the famous Albuquerque, and in their hands it had attained great prosperity, and become the emporium of all the commerce of the gulf. But they were quite indepen dent of the Shah of Persia, whose jealousy and resent ment they excited. Assisted by the English East India Company, 'AbMs collected a fleet at Gombroon, and embarked a Persian force under Imam Kuly Khan. They laid siege to Ormuz, and the Portuguese, having no hope of succour, were forced to surrender. The island is now covered with desolate heaps of ruins. The port of Gombroon, on the mainland, and shel tered by the islands of Kishm and Ormuz, rose on the fall of the Portuguese city. It received the name of 1 The Spanish ambassador calls him ' Berdicano,' and describes him as the richest and most favoured duke in Persia.— Silva MB. 2 M.

In 1623 Sir Eobert Shirley 1 again arrived in England, on an embassy from the Shah; and in 1627 sailed for Persia, in company with Sir Dormer Cotton, who was sent as envoy from Charles I. of England to the Shah of Persia. They landed at Gombroon in 1628, and Sir Dormer obtained a very gracious reception from 'Abb&amp;s, at Kazvin, where he soon afterwards died. Sir Eobert Shirley had now grown old in the service of Persia. On his return he was slighted by the Shah and his favourite Muhammad 'Aly Beg, and he died at Kazvin in July 1628. Of all the brave and gallant adventurers of the glorious age of Elizabeth, Sir Eobert Shirley was by far the greatest traveller, with the exception, perhaps, of Anthony Jenkinson. 'Eank me with those who honour him,' says Sir Thomas Herbert, who accompanied Sir Dormer Cotton, and published a history of the embassy. His Circassian wife, whom Herbert calls ' the thrice worthy and undaunted Lady Teresia, the faithful wife of Sir Eobert Shirley, retired to Eome, and probably became a nun. 1 Sherley Brothers. Printed for private circulation by Mr. Eve lyn Shirley. Sir Eobert's embassies to England, his splendid retinue and large pension, excited much attention at the time. In allusion to it, Shakspeare {Twelfth ii. 5) makes Fabian say, ' I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.''

Act ii. scene 1.286 HISTORY OF PERSIA. The long and glorious reign of 'Abbas the Great was now drawing to a close. But the great crime of his life can never be forgotten, and nothing can palliate it. He entertained a miserable jealousy and mistrust of his eldest son Safy Mirza, who possessed many fine qualities, and he caused him to be basely murdered. Not content with this, he had the eyes of his other two sons put out, and the grandson who was designed for his successor, was dosed with opium to prevent him from becoming intelligent. Such were the atrocious crimes of this great and enlightened prince, whose good qualities were thus destroyed by jealousy and suspicion, the curses of a despot. 'Abbas was very tolerant, and though religious in other respects was fond of wine. He was almost adored by his subjects, and he certainly established peace and tranquillity in Persia, such as had not been known for centuries. He had a fine face, high nose, and keen piercing eyes, wore no beard, but a large moustache, and was uncommonly robust and active. He died at his favourite palace in Mazanderan, in the year 1628, aged 70. Sir John Chardin says,'When this great prince ceased to live, Persia ceased to prosper!'287 CHAPTEE XL the sufAwi dynasty— continued. P ersia was hardly ever more prosperous and powerful than during the reign of 'AbMs the Great; and after his death, though enjoying comparative immunity from invasion, the country groaned for a century under the rule of cruel and degenerate Sufawi monarchs. Shah 'Abbas was succeeded in 1628 by his grandson Shah Safy, a youth only in his eighteenth year. From this period, the royal princes, instead of being educated as soldiers, were, by the short-sighted and suspicious policy of their fathers, imprisoned in the har^m. The natural consequence was that the brave audacious princes who were the immediate successors of Shfih Isma'il, were succeeded by a race of effeminate and cruel tyrants. SMh Safy was capricious, cruel, and a great drunk ard. His most infamous act was the murder of Imam Kuly Khan, governor of Pars, the faithful friend and adviser of his grandfather. During this tyrant's im becile reign, Kandahar was given over to the Great Mogul, and the Turks retook Baghdad. SMh Safy died in 1641, and was buried at Kum. 1 1 Rodolph Stadler of Zurich was his watchmaker.288 HISTORY OF PERSIA. He was succeeded by his son 'Abbas II., who retook Kandahar when only sixteen years of age, conducting the campaign in person. In 1664 an embassy arrived at Isfahan from the Grand-duke of Muscovy to Sh&amp;h 'Abbas II., consisting of two envoys and eight hundred followers. They were at first courteously received, and lodged in a royal palace, splendidly furnished, which they defiled by their disgustingly filthy habits. The Persians there fore, viewed them as the most base and degraded people in the world ; and eventually it was discovered that their object was commerce, and that the character of ambassadors had been assumed to evade the pay ment of the customary duties on merchandise. 1 The indignation of 'Abb4s II. was excited at their duplicity and filthiness, and he treated them with contempt, sending them back with scarcely an answer. He also received several embassies from Europe, and gave every encouragement to the Christian merchants and artificers who settled at Isfahan. It is recorded that, when urged to persecute the unbelievers, he said, 'It is for God, not for me, to judge of men's con sciences, and I will never interfere with what belongs to the tribunal of the Great Creator and Lord of the Universe.' But, like his father, he was a miserable drunkard, and died from the effects of drink in the year 1668. 'Abbas II. and his father Shah Safy are buried in a beautiful mosque at Kum, with a lofty gilded dome, near the shrine of the holy Fatimah. Abbas II. was succeeded by his eldest son Shah 1 Chardin, Paris 1811, vol. ix. p. 112*i ' LATER SUFAWI KINGS. 289 Safy H, who, however, having fallen very ill, was crowned a second time, at a more auspicious moment, under the name of SMh Sulaiman. No people are more addicted to astrological absurdities than the Persians; and to this day no journey is undertaken, no city entered, and no important act performed, without consulting the astrologers for an auspicious hour. Shah Sulaiman was weak, dissolute, unwarlike, and horribly cruel. Scarcely a day passed without some one of his courtiers or servants being maimed, or put to some lingering torture. At the same time the Uzbegs renewed their periodical incursions into Khurasan, the Dutch seized upon the island of Kishm, and the Eussians made inroads into GhMn and Mazanderan. But the court of Isfahan, during this reign, was renowned throughout Asia for its splendour, and foreigners continued to be encouraged and protected. The learned Kcempfer visited Persia at this time, and praises Shah Sulaiman, who, by every other historian, is branded as a cruel and remorseless tyrant. He died in the year 1694. His son and successor, named SMh Sultan Husain, was, during the early part of his reign, under the influence of fanatic Mullahs, who induced him to per secute those philosophical Sufis, who represented all the literary merit of his country. This Shah, though good-hearted, was a weak and licentious man, whp no sooner escaped from the influence of the Miillahs than he fell into the hands of women and eunuchs. For twenty years a profound, peace prevailed throughout the empire, but it was the precursor of a terrible and u r ;l !

In the mountainous districts of Kandahar and Mbul, the hardy tribes of Afghans had for centuries led a wild and almost independent life. They were divided into two great branches, the Ghilzis of Ghaznah and K4bul, and the Sadozais of Kandahar and Herat, who derived their name from SMo, their chief in the time of'AbMs I. SMh SuMn Husain appointed a Georgian, named Gurghin Khan, as governor of Kandahar, and a chief of one of the Ghilzi tribes, named Mir Wais, who had com plained of his tyranny, was sent a prisoner to Isfahan. Mir Wa'is was a man of great talent and no httle cunning. He was permitted to go on a pilgrimage to Mekkah in the year 1707, and on his return, he so gained upon the confidence of the Persian court, that he was allowed to return home. At Kandahar he planned a conspiracy against the government, killed Gurghin Khan and all his retinue, seized the city, defeated two Persian armies that were sent against him, and died a natural death in 1715. His brother, Mir 'Abdallah, succeeded him in the government of the Afghans ; but, after a few months, Mahmud, the son of Mir Wais, a very young man, murdered his uncle, and assumed the style of a sovereign prince. In the meanwhile dark clouds were rising all round the horizon, ready to overwhelm the doomed Sufawi dynasty. The SMozHi tribe revolted at Herat, and declared itself independent in 1717 ; the Kurds overranAFGHAN INVASION. 291 the country round Hamadan, the Uzbegs desolated Khurasan, and the Arabs of Maskat seized the island of el-Bahrein, and threatened Bandar 'Abbas. Thus surrounded by dangers on all sides, the wretched SMh was bewildered. He made one vain attempt to regain his possessions in the Persian Gulf; but the Portuguese fleet, which had promised to transport his troops to el-Bahrein, was defeated by the Imam of Mlskat, and forced to retreat to Goa. The court of Isfahan had no sooner received tidings of this disaster, than Mahmud, with a large army of Afghans invaded Persia in the year 1721, seized Kirman, and in the following year advanced to within four days' march of the city of Isfahan. The Shah offered him a sum of money to return to Kandahar, but the AfgMn answered by advancing to a place called Gulnabad, within nine miles of the capital. The effeminate and luxurious courtiers were taken completely by surprise, no preparation had been made, and the capital was unprovided with either provisions or ammunition. The ill-disciplined Persian army, hastily collected, advanced to attack the rebels. Their centre was led by Shaikh Aly KMn, covered by twenty-four field pieces. The Wali of Arabia commanded the right, and the I'timadu-'d-Daulah, or prime minister, the left wing. The whole force amounted to 50,000 men, while the Afghans could not count half that number. On March 8, 1722, the richly dressed hosts of Persia appeared before the little band of Afghans, who were scorched and disfigured by their long marches.

Wall of Arabia commenced the battle by attacking the left wing of the Afghans with great fury, routing it, and plundering their camp. The prime minister, im mediately afterwards, attacked the enemy's left wing, but was routed, and the Afghans, taking advantage of the confusion, captured the Persian guns and turned them on their centre, who tied in confusion, without striking a blow. The Wali of Arabia escaped into Isfahan, and Mahmud the Afghan gained a complete victory. Fifteen thousand Persians remained dead on the field. A panic now seized on the surrounding inhabitants, thousands of country people fled into the city, and the squares and streets were filled with a helpless multitude. Isfahan was then one of the most magnificent and largest cities in Asia, containing more than 600,000 inhabitants. After his victory, Mahmad seized on the Armenian suburb of Julfa, and invested the doomed city; but Tahmasp, son of the Shah, had previously escaped into the mountains of Mazanderan. Famine soon began to press hard upon the besieged, and, in September, Shah Husain offered to capitulate. He agreed to abdicate in favour of Mahmud, and to deliver himself up as a prisoner. Having been con ducted to the Afghan camp, he fixed the royal plume of feathers on the young rebel's turban, with his own hand ; and 4,000 Afghans were ordered to occupy the palace and gates of the city. 1 1 We have an account of the Afghan invasion, and sack of Isfahan, from an eye-witness, Father Krusinski, Procurator of the Jesuits at' Ml 41 !il AFGHAN INVASION. 295 beginning to rise, and the days of Afghan usurpation were numbered. He had collected a small army in Mazanderan, and was supported by Fat-h 'Aly Khan, the powerful chief of the Kajar tribe. In 1727 the fugitive Shah was joined by Mdir Kuly, a robber chief, who was already famous for his undaunted valour, and who was destined to become the mightiest conqueror of the age. He murdered Fat-h Aly, and, having easily appeased the Shah, received the command of the royal army. In 1729 Ashraf became alarmed at these formidable preparations in the north, and led an Afghan army into Khurasan, where he was defeated by Mdir at Damghan, and forced to retreat. The Persian general followed close in his rear, and again entirely defeated him outside Isfahan, in Novem ber of the same year. The Afghans fled through the town; and Ashraf, murdering the poor old Shah Husain in his way, fled with the wreck of his army towards Shiraz. On November 16, the victorious Nadir entered Isfahan; and was soon followed by his master, the young Shah Tahmasp II., who burst into tears when he beheld the ruined and defaced walls of the palace of his ancestors. His mother, who had escaped the numerous massacres, by disguising herself as a slave, and performing the most degrading offices, now came forth, and threw herself into his arms. NMir did not give his enemies time to recover from their defeat. He followed them up, and again utterly defeated them in January, 1730, Ashraf tried to 11 i ; rm IJii I V:f llli ,296 HISTORY OF PERSIA. escape to Kandahar almost alone, but was murdered by a party of Baluchi robbers ; and thus, by the genius of Nadir, his native land was delivered from the terri ble Afghan invaders. The ambition of Nadir, how ever, was far greater than his loyalty. On the pretext of his incapacity, he dethroned Tahmasp II. in 1732, and sent him a prisoner into Khurasan, where he was murdered, some years afterwards, by Mdir's son, while the conqueror was absent on his Indian expedition. For a short time the wily usurper placed Tahmasp's son on the throne, a little child, with the title of 'Abbas III., while he contented himself with the office of Eegent. Poor little Abbas died at a very con venient time, in the year 1736, and Mdir then threw off the mask. He was proclaimed Shah of Persia, by a vast assemblage, on the plain of Mogan. Thus ended the Sufawi dynasty, after reigning 223 years, from the accession of Shah Ismail to the capture of Isfahan by the Afghans. The sovereigns of this race fill a very conspicuous and important position. Under them the Persians were once more consolidated into one powerful people, with national feelings and national antipathies ; under them the Shia'ah religion became firmly rooted into the hearts of the people, and by making them despise and distrust their neigh bours, bound them more closely together by unity of interests; and under them the poetry and literature of former ages was so effectually patronized, that from that time to this, every Persian with the slightest pre tension to refinement, is able to quote many passages from the Sufy poets. Nor was this period deficient inSUFAWI DYNASTY. 297 authors of its own. Muhammad Kumal, in the reign of 'Abbas II., wrote a History of Persia from the reign of Shah Tsma'il: and that famous historian, Ferishta, though living in India, and resting his fame on a History of Indian Dynasties, was a Persian, born at Astrabad, on the shores of the Caspian, in the year 1570. SMh Isma'll and Abbas the Great were two of the most talented aud powerful sovereigns of Persia since the days of Naurshirvan ; but the later Shahs of this dynasty were cruel and degenerate tyrants, who had filled their cup of iniquity to overflowing, when the mighty Mdir put an end to their existence, and pro claimed that the Sufawis had ceased to reign.298 HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTEE XII. NlDIR SHlH. In a wretched little tent, which was pitched near the fortress of Kelat, in Khurasan, famous as the site of one of Eustam's victories, a poor woman gave birth to a son, who was named NadKiily, or ' the Slave of the Wonderful,' in the year 1688. The child's father earned his livelihood by making sheep-skin coats for the peasants, and Nadir was brought up as shepherd until the age of thirteen, when his father died. An ass and a camel were his only patrimony, and he kept his mother by gathering sticks in the woods and carrying them to market. In 1704 a marauding band of Uzbegs carried himself and his mother away into slavery. The latter died, but young Nildir escaped, after four years of servitude, and, having stolen a flock of sheep, fled into the mountains of Khur^s^n, and adopted the life of a robber. His reputation for daring and bravery soon spread over the country; and in 1714 he received the command of a large force, from the governor of his native province, with which he repulsed an invasion of the Uzbegs and Turkmans. When Persia was groaning under the yoke of theNADIR SHAH. 299 conquering Afghans, and the rightful SMh was a fugitive in Mazander4n 5 the intrepid robber chief offered his services to his unfortunate sovereign : and, having murdered Fat-h 'Aly Khan, chief of the Kajars, and former commander, he became General of Tah- masp's army. Nadir now displayed extraordinary ability, and, as has been before related, in two years had conquered the Afghans in several hard-fought battles, thus com pletely ridding Persia from foreign invasion. For a time Tahmasp II. was restored to the throne, but the ambition of the robber could never rest satisfied with the position of a subject. Tahmasp and his little son were disposed of; and in 1736 NMir was proclaimed Shah of Persia, by a vast assemblage of chiefs on the famous plains of Mogan, in Azerbaijan. Having defeated the Turks, and driven them out of Hamad^n, Nadir turned an eye of longing cupidity on the rich, but now degenerate, Indian empire of the Great Mogul. The empire of the descendants of Bilber in India, 1 had risen to the height of its splendour during the reign of Aurungzib, who died in 1707 ; and, at the time of Nadir's rise, it was sunk to the lowest ebb of degradation. Muhammad Shah, the reigning Great Mogul, passed his time in sensual pleasures in the palace at Delhi, while the Mahrattas plundered his 1 Baber, that most charming of autobiographers, was a Turk, and hated the Moguls most cordially. It is curious that his descen dants, through ignorance, should have received in Europe the name of Great Moguls.pvi 11,9! iilt 1:1 :l!^ ; ■ : v ; \ - .

One of the great 'Umaras or lords, who enjoyed the title of Nizdmu-l-Mulk, ' Eegulator of the State,' governed the important province of the. Dekkan; while Devran KMn, the chief adviser of the Mogul, exposed his pusillanimous weakness by bribing the Mahrattas with large sums, to desist from their incursions. The rich and splendid city of Delhi, the centre of all this pitiable weakness, was founded by Shah-Jehan in 1631, on the west side of the river Jumna, in the midst of a fertile plain. The palace, surrounded by a wall 30 feet high, of reddish stone, is built along the banks of the river, and encircled by orange groves and apricot trees. The Dtwdn-i-Khdss, or ' hall of audience,' was the chief pride of the palace, and an inscription pro claimed, ' If there is an elysium on earth, it is here— this is it!' In its palmy days it contained the famous throne, which stood on six massy golden legs set with rubies, emeralds, and diamonds, while golden peacocks, covered with precious stones and pearls, formed its canopy. The ceiling of this superb hall consisted of satin canopies, and the walls were hung with silken tapestries embroidered with gold. Here the Great Mogul, surrounded by 'Umaras in gorgeous dresses, gave audiences to governors and ambassadors. On these state occasions he was attired in white satin, covered with gold embroidery, a turban of cloth of gold surmounted by the figure of a heron, whose feet were covered with large diamonds, and a collar of enormous pearls. The other chambers of the palaceNADIR SHAH. 301 were no less magnificent, and the vaults were filled with countless treasure. The houses of the rich and luxu rious 'Umaras beautified the two principal streets of the city, but the poorer classes lived in mean houses thatched with straw. It can be no matter of wonder that these vast treasures were coveted by the victorious Nadir; and that the Great Mogul and his effeminate court should have been suddenly startled, in the midst of their pleasures, by the news that a Persian army was on the frontier. The detention of an envoy gave a pretext for in vasion. Having captured Kandahar, Nadir invested the city of Kabul, which was bravely defended by a chief named Sherzih KMn. But his applications for aid were neglected by the Court of Delhi, and, after a month's siege, Kabul was taken by storm in June 1738. The Persian army then advanced through the narrow mountainous passes between K^bul and Pesha- wur, and NMir succeeded in bribing the warlike Afghan tribes to remain neutral. He thus conducted his forces in safety through those dangerous defiles, and captured Peshawur. Having surmounted this difficulty, the invader led his army across the Indus at Atak, by means of two iron chains, to which inflated skins were made fast, and covered with planks, thus forming a bridge of boats. The Court of the Mogul was at length thoroughly alarmed. A vast army of 200,000 men, under the joint command of Devran Khan and Nizamu-'l-Mulk, who hated each other iiiost cordially, was collected302 HISTORY OF PERSIA. outside the walls of the capital, and having been joined by Muhammad SMh in person, with a splendid court, they advanced to the plain of Karnal, about 60 miles north of Delhi. Having crossed the Indus, NMir Shah rested his army for a few days at Lahore, and then advanced towards the plain of KarnHl. In 28 months he had marched more than 850 miles. At the same time the Mogul was reinforced by Saadit KMn, a powerful 'Umara, with 20,000 men ; but the vast assemblage of Indians, without discipline, valour, or unanimity, had little chance against the tried veterans of Nadir's army. The engagement was commenced by a party of 6,000 Kurds, who began to pillage the baggage of Saadit Khan's division, on the extreme right of the Indian army. Devrdn KMn led his men up to strengthen Saadit, and N&amp;dir advancing at the same time, with a thousand chosen horse, the action became warm; but the Indians, by the judicious arrangement of the Persian, were also attacked in flank, their brigade of elephants was routed by the clever contri vance of placing stages full of burning tow on the backs of camels, and a panic seized the army. In the thick of the fight Devran Khan was mortally wounded, and fell back senseless on his elephant. Night put an end to the strife. Only a small portion of the Indian right wing had been engaged, and the Great Mogul was desirous of renewing the battle on the following day. But the cowardly or treacherous counsel of the Nizamu- '1-Mulk prevailed, and the Emperor of India submitted to the terms of the rude conqueror.NADIR SHAH. 303 Muhammad SMh, the following day, was conducted to Nadir's tent by the Persian Wazir Tahmasp Khan, where he was received with courtesy, but upbraided for having given the conqueror the trouble to march so far to chastise him. The Mogul listened in silence and shame, and the next day the melancholy march to Delhi commenced. The Great Mogul was attended by 12,000 Persians, followed by NMir with the bulk of his army, and in six days the disgraced monarch found himself a prisoner in his own capital. On the following day Nadir Shah made his entry into the city, where every house was closed, and proceeded straight to the palace. Here the Indian lords, with true oriental servility, vied with each other in obsequious flattery of their new master. Saadit Khan, alone, preferred a dose of poison. 1 Next day Tahmasp KMn sent some Persian cavalry to open the granaries, which caused the assembly of a mob, and several Persians were killed. Nadir issued out of the palace to suppress the tumult, but mode ration only increased the insolence of the Hindus, and at length the fierce warrior's wrath was kindled. He ordered the whole city to be given up to pillage and massacre; and, drawing his sword, he stationed himself 1 Saadit KMn invited NMir into India, and the loss of the battle of Karnal was concerted between him and Asaf Jah (the Nizamu- '1-Mulk), ancestor of the Nizllms of the Dekkan. Nadir rewarded their treachery by spitting on their beards, and ordering them to be driven from his court. Saadit Khan, Governor of Oudh, was ancestor of the kings of Oudh. He was originally a Persian pedlar, native of Khurasan.304 history of persia. on the roof of a mosque near the centre of the city, 1 whence he overlooked the work of destruction in grim and sullen silence. He had ordered that in every street where the dead body of a Persian was found, no soul should remain alive. Neither age nor sex was spared, rivers of blood flowed through the streets, and every house from the palace to the hovel was filled with mourning. At length the wretched Emperor threw himself at Nadir's feet, and implored him to spare his people. The haughty conqueror answered that the Mogul's prayer was granted. He sheathed his sword, and the massacre ceased. It had lasted from 8 a.m . to 3 p.m., and not less than 120,000 souls, or, according to another account, 200,000, had perished; 2 while many women had suffered most infamous treatment before they were relieved by death. Next day, under threat of punishment, all persons were ordered to pursue their usual employments, and a festival celebrated the betrothal of NMir's second son to a niece of the Great Mogul. The etiquette of the Imperial Court required that the bridegroom should prove seven generations of noble ancestry. ' Tell them,' said Nadir, ' that he is the son of Nadir, the son of the sword, the grandson of the sword, and so on for seventy, instead of seven generations, if they like it.' The fallen monarch was satisfied with the nobility of this terrible pedigree. Tahmasp KMn, the Persian Wazir, was commissioned 1 The little mosque of Roknu-'d-Daulah, in the great bazar. 2 Fraser makes the number from 120,000 to 150,000.X NADIK SHAH. 305 to inspect the collection of the treasure to be extorted from the people and court of Delhi. The contributions were exacted from high and low, with the utmost rigour; no cruelties were left unpractised; and at length an enormous sum was amassed. The jewels taken from the Great Mogul himself and his nobles amounted to 42,500,000/.; the famous peacock throne being alone valued at 11,250,000/. Gold and silver plate, melted into large ingots, came to 37,500,000/.; and other spoils, consisting of rich furniture, cannon, and warlike stores, brought the amount up to the prodigious sum of 87,500,000/. Another account gives it at 70,000,000/.; and the lowest estimate is considerably above 30,000,000/. 1 This wholesale spoliation gives some idea of the splendour of the Court of Delhi, previous to the ruinous invasion of the Persians. Before leaving Delhi, N&amp;dir Shah replaced the crown on the head of the Great Mogul with his own hand, and gave him a long lecture on the government of India, concluding with these alarming words,' If neces sary, I can be with you myself in forty days from Kandahar. Never reckon me far off.' On the 4th of May 1739, the conqueror mustered his army in the 1 Scott gives about 8,000,000/. to 9,000,000/.

It is estimated that, besides the treasure taken away, the natives of Delhi lost 30,000,000/. by damage done to houses burnt and fields laid waste. At least 200,000 human beings perished in this terrible visi tation—40,000 between Peshawur and Karnal, 110,000 in the massacre, and 50,000 by a famine caused by the ravages of the invaders. It would have been well for the fame of the once mighty family of Timfrr, if Muhammad SMh had fallen, sword in hand, at Karnal, instead of fingering on a disgraced existence in his ruined capital. His pitiable descendants sank lower and lower, first in the power of the Afghans and Mahrattas, then as pen sioners of the British Government; and in our time the degenerate representative of the mighty Timur, the accomplished Sh&amp;h Eokh, the brave and learned Baber, and the magnificent Aurungzib, became the miserable puppet of an inhuman gang of mutineers. On his return. Nadir first marched to Herat, where he made a triumphant display of his treasures, previous to depositing them in the almost impregnable castle of Kelat, close to his own birthplace, in Khurasan. He then undertook a successful campaign against Khiva and Bukhara. But the robbery of the riches of Delhi proved a curse to him. From the time of his return he became suspicious, avaricious, and cruel. Numbers of innocentNADIR SHAH. 307 persons were almost daily put to death or horribly mutilated ; and his own son E&amp;zha Kuly, who, it is true, had intended to assassinate his father, had his eyes put out. Nevertheless, this extraordinary man conceived many plans for the improvement of the country, and encouraged the enterprise of foreign merchants. He established his capital at Mash-had. One of the most remarkable events in the reign of NMir Shah, was the attempt of some English merchants to open a trade with Persia, by Eussia and the Caspian Sea. Anthony Jenkinson, Queen Elizabeth's envoy to SMh Tahmasp, was the first Englishman who ever hoisted the cross of St. George at the peak of his own ship on the Caspian Sea. In 1557 he travelled through Eussia to Bukhara, and returned by the Caspian and the Volga in 1560. He obtained a decree from the king of Shirvan, granting permission to the English to establish a factory there. In 1579 one Christopher Burrough built a ship at Nijni Novgorod, and traded across the Caspian to Baku ; but she was stranded by the ice, and the cargo of raw silk, being saved in a boat, was landed at Astrakhan. The Caspian Sea is 640 miles long and from 100 to 200 broad. Towards the centre it is very deep, but other parts are shallow, and the N.E. and S.E. shores are low, swampy, and covered with reeds. There are no tides, but violent gales from the north and south ; and, though there is no outlet, it receives no less than 84 streams and rivers, besides the Volga. There are immense quantities of sturgeon, salmon, and x 2 ! 11 1 'i i ! i im i l ! i| ; it'll i? Ml308 history of pees i a. smaller fish in this sea ; and, after a storm, the shores of Ghilan and Mazanderan are covered with them. It is a remarkable fact that the Caspian is 83 feet below the level of the Black Sea. The Persians call it Deryd Kulzum} One of the earliest navigators of the Caspian was Patrocles, Admiral of Seleucus ; and Justinian, the Eoman general, ravaged the coast of Hyrcania with his fleet in 572 a.d. Peter the Great formed a naval armament at Astra khan, marched in person to Derbent, and caused his army to occupy Ghilan ; but, owing to the unhealthi- ness of the climate, the Empress Anne ordered the troops to evacuate it in 1739. Peter was anxious that the English should open a trade to Persia, through Eussia; and, in 1738, Mr. John Elton, who had been employed for four years by the Eussian Government, on the Orenburgh frontier, proposed to the British merchants in St. Petersburg to trade on the Caspian. In 1738 he left the Eussian service, made up a cargo of goods for Persia, and, sailing from Astrakhan, reached the road of Enzeli in May 1739, after a voyage of fourteen days in a Eussian vessel. Enzeli is the anchorage for the province of Ghilan; and Elton, having landed his goods, proceeded to Eesht, eight miles inland, to exchange his English broadcloth for raw silk. 1 The coasts of the Caspian have now been thoroughly explored by Russian officers. The results of the chronometric and magnetic survey of the Caspian, with a chart of soundings, were published by the Russian Government in 1866, in two handsome volumes. The survey operations had been carried on in 1858-61.JOHN ELTON. 309 Elton obtained a decree from Eazha Kuly, NMir's son, granting him permission to trade in Persia; so, leaving his agent Mr. Grteme at Eesht, he reached St. Petersbnrgh in January, 1740. He there presented a petition to the British minister, applying for leave to build ships, and establish a factory and a consul at Mash-had, with a branch at Eesht, and he obtained permission from Eussia to build a ship at Kazan. 1 Soon afterwards, with a large cargo of cloth, he sailed to Persia, and entered into the service of Nadir Shah, engaging to build a fleet and protect the Persian shores of the Caspian. There were almost insuperable difficulties of every kind in his way, but this brave and indefatigable Englishman overcame them all. He found good timber in Ghilan, sail-cloth he made of cotton, cordage of flax, and he fished for Eussian anchors that had been lost during a course of years on the coast. His grand scheme was to open a trade from Astrabad to Mash-had, and thence to the cities of India. In 1743, a worthy English merchant, named Jonas Hanway, embarked on board the ' Empress of Eussia,' an English vessel with the national flag flying, at Astrakhan. She was a small brig. He had with him 5,000^. worth of cloth. Finding no market in Ghilan, 1 In those days it took From Ghilan to Astrakhan (including quarantine) 30 days. „ Astrakhan to Zaritzen „ „ 10 „ „ Zaritzen to Moscow „ „ 35 „ „ Moscow to St. Petersburgh „ 20 „ Total 95 „310 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. he sailed for Astrabad, and was four days in sight of the splendid peak of Demavend. While Hanway was at Astrabad, Muhammad Husain Khan, chief of the Kajar tribe, who, after his father had been put to death by Nadir, had taken refuge with the Turkmans, suddenly attacked and captured the town. All the property of the British merchant was plun dered ; but the vengeance of Nadir soon overtook the insurgent. Astrabad was retaken, blood flowed like water, and Muhammad Husain once more took refuge with the Turkmans. His two little sons, Agha Mu hammad and Husain Kuly, remained as prisoners in the power of NMir Shah. Having escaped out of the hands of the Turkmans, Hanway made a journey to Nadir's camp at Kazvin, and obtained a decree for payment of his losses at Astrabad. The English traveller was astonished at the mag nificence of the Eastern conqueror and his army. Eunning footmen, he tells us, chanters, and guards, ran before the SMh when he rode forth ; and he had four complete sets of horse furniture, one mounted with pearls, another with emeralds, another with rubies, and a fourth with diamonds; one of the latter as large as a pigeon's egg (the Kuh-i-NAr ?). In September 1744, Hanway left Eesht, and re turned to Eussia with a cargo of Fersian silk. But the jealous policy of the Eussian Government could never endure a British trade on the Caspian, and they determined to destroy it. They also watched the proceedings of Elton with suspicion, and were deeplyENGLISH ON THE CASPIAN. 311 offended at his having entered the service of NMir SMh. But, in spite of them, the bold Englishman, by dint of indomitable perseverance and great skill, suc ceeded in completing for the Persian Navy a vessel mounting twenty 3-pounders, and larger than any Eussian craft on the Caspian. In November 1746, jealous of the proceedings of Elton, the Eussian Government formally prohibited the British Caspian trade ; and the two English vessels were obliged to be sold, at a great loss, to the Eussian merchants at Astrakhan. The whole export of cloth for this trade had been 174,398/.: and the import of raw Persian silk only 93,375/. The difficulties against which those gallant merchant adventurers had to contend were insurmountable; but the attempt to establish commercial intercourse between England and Persia, by means of the Caspian, though unsuccessful, was an undertaking worthy of English men, and deserving of a place in history. 1 During the latter years of the reign of NMir Sh^h, his tyranny and capricious cruelty became more and more insupportable. He ordered the beloved and time-honoured Shia ? ah doctrine of the Persians to be changed for the Siinnah creed, and any disobedience was punished with cruel mutilation or death. At length the wicked tyrant filled up the sum of his crimes, and retribution overtook him in the midst of his terrible career. 1 One lasting and most valuable result of this bold undertaking was Jonas Han way's charming account of his travels, and his very valuable Life of Nadir Shah (3 vols, quarto).312 HISTORY OF PERSIA. In 1747, Nadir encamped on the plains of SuMn Maiden, about a day's journey north of Mash-had; where he meditated, with the assistance of his Turk man and Uzbeg forces, the massacre of all the Persians whose fidelity he suspected. But the plot was over heard, and recoiled upon its author. At dead of night a Persian officer, named Saleh Beg, passed the guard, and, having discovered Nadir's tent, he cut him with a sabre while asleep. The tyrant sprang up, but, in retiring from the tent, he tripped over the cords, and Saleh gave him a mortal wound, ' Spare me,' cried he, 'and I will forgive you all.' The assassin answered, 'You have not shown any mercy, and therefore merit none.' Thus fell this mighty conqueror. He was rude and illiterate, but possessed a magical influence over his soldiers, and an intuitive instinct which seemed to point out to him the exact moment for action. He was six feet high, with round shoulders, and large, expressive eyes, fixed under a broad expanse of fore head. His voice was like thunder, and a battle-axe was his favourite weapon. Nadir's head was sent to his nephew, 'Aly Euly, then commanding troops near Herat; but the courier lost it on the road, and, to screen his negligence, sub stituted that of some other man. The body was buried at Mash-had, under a small tomb, with a garden planted round it; but the founder of the present reigning dynasty of Persia, the Kajars, whose grand- sire had been murdered by NMir, desecrated the tomb, destroyed the garden, dug up the body, and, it is said.SUCCESSORS OF NADIR SHAH. 313 placed his bones under the steps of the throne at Tehran, that all who passed might trample on them. When Burnes was at Mdsh-had in 1832, a peasant had planted a crop of turnips over the grave. On the death of Nadir his mighty empire fell to pieces, and anarchy prevailed over Persia. On the day after his assassination the Uzbegs and Afghans in his army fought a battle with the Persians; and, afterwards, Ahmed Abdallah, who commanded the Afghan contingent, rode home with a few thousand horsemen, and as many jewels as he could steal, (among which was the Kuh-i-Nur), and founded the Dur&amp;ni empire. On receiving tidings of his uncle's death, Aly Kuly ascended the vacant throne, and assumed the title of Adil SMh, or' the Just King.' He displayed his justice by murdering Edzha Kuly, NMir's blind son, and thirteen of the sons and grandsons of the deceased conqueror; besides cruelly mutilating Agha Mu hammad, the son of Muhammad Husain Khan, chief of the Kdjars, who had been a prisoner in NMir's camp for some years. After a reign of a few months, Adil Shah was defeated, taken prisoner, and blinded by his brother Ibrahim, governor of 'Irak, who pro claimed himself king ; but was, soon afterwards, made prisoner by his own troops, and killed at Mash-had, where Adil Shah was also put to death. Shah Eokh, son of Eazha Kuly, and grandson of Nadir Shah, then succeeded. He was a very young man, and his mother was a daughter of SMh Husain, the unfortunate Sufawi king. In 1748, a chief named314 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. Seyyid Muhammad, suddenly attacked him, before he could collect any troops, and, having got possession of his person, cruelly deprived him of sight. The ad venturer, whose mother was a sister of Shah Husain, then proclaimed himself king with the name of Su- laimiln; but Yusuf, Shah Eokh's general, defeated him, and the blind young prince was restored. He continued to govern KhurMn, at Mash-had, but the chiefs of that province, though owning him a nominal obedience, virtually remained in a state of complete independence. Meanwhile, the chiefs of Ghilan, for a brief space, assumed the government of their province, and dis graced it by the murder of that brave and intrepid Enghshman, John Elton; but soon, Muhammad Husain KMn, chief of the Kajars, returned from his exile in the land of the Turkmans, and conquered Mazanderan and GhMn. Azerbaijan continued under the rule of an Afghan governor appointed by Mdir • and Georgia, then governed by a Christian prince named Heraclius, who had learnt the art of war in Nadir's army, was placed under the protection of Eussia. But the most important consequence of NMir's death was the formation of a compact and powerful empire in Afghanistan. Afghanistan, that mountainous country between Persia and India, has, from time immemorial, been inhabited by a brave and independent race of men, who have ever scorned subjection to a foreign yoke, and lead, for the most part, roving, restless lives. The Afghans are divided into two great tribes orEISE OF AFGHAN POWEE. 315 divisions—the GMzis, who inhabit Ghaznah and Xabul; and the Abdulis or Duranis of Kandahar and Herat. The Ghilzis, in former times, had the ascendancy, and their chief Mahmud conquered Persia and over threw the Sufawi dynasty; but, after their expul sion by Mdir Shah, the rival tribe gained the supremacy. The numerous Afghan tribes of Abduli inhabit a tract of country bounded on the north by the Paro- pamisan mountains, on the west by the sandy desert extending to Persia, on the south-west by Sistan, on the south by the Baluchis, and on the east by the Ghilzis of Ghaznah. In the north, at the foot of the Paropamisan moun tains, the country is hilly, and contains fertile valleys abounding in tamarisks, willows, and fruit-trees; but the greater part of the land of the Abdulis is desert and sandy. The river Helmund, however, has a strip of cultivated country on either bank; and the neigh bourhood of Kandahar is fertile and well cultivated. The Durani or Abduli tribe is divided into nine clans, the chief of which are the Sadozais-—that of the old Eoyal family—and the Barakzais, a spirited, war like, and numerous sept, inhabiting the country south of Kandahar, the banks of the Helmund, and the plains in its vicinity. In 1808 the Abdulis numbered 800,000 souls. In the early part of the sixteenth century the Abdfili tribe of Afghans, hard pressed by the Uzbegs, con sented to pay tribute to the Sufawi kings of Persia;316 HISTORY OF PERSIA. and then it was that the chief of the Sadozais clan ob tained supreme authority over the whole AlxKili tribe, and became possessed of great honour and many privi leges. In 1716 they seized Herat, and established a democratic government there under the Sadoz^i chief. NMir SMh besieged Herat in 1731, and took it after a brave defence of ten months. He then forced a large body of Abdulis to join his army, under Ahmed Abdallah, the young chief of the Sadozais. After the assassination of Mdir Shah, in June 1747, Ahmed retreated to Kandahar with about 3,000 horse, and as many jewels as he could secure from the wreck of the Persian camp (including the Kuh-i-Nur). His native tribe, whose name he changed to DAranis, flocked around him, and in October he was crowned, with the title of Ahmed Shah Duri Duran ; the most powerful chiefs of the DiMnis, Baluchis and Hazarehs, being present. In 1748 he reduced the rival Afghan tribe of Ghilzis, appointing Durani governor over them, and thus became sovereign of the whole of Afghan istan. Not satisfied with this great success, Ahmed Shah invaded India, overran the Panjab, and threatened the city of Delhi (where Muhammed Shah was on his death-bed), but returned to Kandahar without pur suing his conquests. In 1749 the Durani Shah advanced from Herat to Mdsh-had, where he treated Shah Eokh, the blind descendant of his old master, with respect and consi deration, confirming him in the gover nm ent of Khudi- s4n. His further advance into Persia was checked byAHMED SHAH DUEANL 317 the bold defence of the town of Nishlpur, and the determined opposition of Muhammad Husain Khan, the Kajar chief, at Astrabad. Ahmed, therefore, leaving Shah Eokh in the enjoyment of his nominal sovereign ity at Mdsh-had, returned to Herat in 1751. In 1752 the Afghan sovereign marched into the Panjab, and conquered Kashmir; after which time he remained for four years in peace at Kandahar, strengthening and consolidating his extensive do minions. Ahmed Shah again invaded India in 1759, entirely defeated a great army of Mahrattas at Panipiit, and entered Delhi in triumph. But the Afghan con queror prudently refrained from the dangerous task of annexing the vast provinces of India. He left a miserable puppet on the throne at Delhi, and con tented himself with Peshawur, Kashmir, and Sindh. Ahmed SMh died near Kandahar in 1773, in his fiftieth year, after an active and most successful career. 1 His dominions, at the time of his death, included Kan dahar, Herat, Sistan, Ghaznah, Kabul, Balkh, Kash mir, and Sindh—thus forming the celebrated Durani Empire. Ahmed was succeeded by his son Timlir, who changed the seat of government from Kandahar to Kabul. He died in 1793, and his sons who followed him—SMh Zam&amp;n, MahmM, and Shah Sujah—to- 1 Nadir, for an act of insubordination, had cut off one of his ears. The limits of his empire at his death, were, to north, the Oxus and the mountains of Kaliiristan ; to the south the sea of 'Oman; to the east the mountains of Tibet, the Sutlej, and the Indus; and to the west Khurasan and Kir man.318 HISTORY OF PEESIA. gether with the famous brothers of the Barakzai tribe, who overthrew their dynasty, and are now represented by Shir 'Aly EMn, son of the famous Dost Muhammad, have been intimately connected with the modern history both of British India, and of Persia.319 CHAPTER XIII. the zend dynasty. On the breaking up of the empire of NMir Shah we have seen how Khurasan remained under the nominal sovereignty of Shah Eokh; Afghanistan became a powerftil kingdom under Ahmed Abdallah; Mazan- deran and Ghilan were seized by the chief of the Eajars; and Azerbaijan was retained by Azwad Khan, an Afghan of the Ghilzi tribe, who had been made governor of that province by NMir. But the central and most important part of Persia yet remains to be accounted for. During more than twenty years it was governed by the best and most virtuous sovereign of Persia, since its conquest by the Muhammadans. On the death of NMir, the chief of the Bakhtiyari tribe, named Eeshid, who had held a high station in the court of the conqueror, fled, with a large treasure, to his native mountains, and assisted his brother Aly Murdau to appear as a competitor for the vacant throne of Persia. The lofty chain of mountains, extending from Ker- manshah to Shlraz, and covering great part of the320 HISTORY OF PERSIA. provinces of Luristdn and Khuzistan, is inhabited by numerous and powerful tribes of Persian origin. 1 The Feilis, a wandering tribe of about 200,000 families, occupy the western side of the mountains of Luristan, and have long been almost independent of any government. The Bakhtiyari tribes inhabit the mountains of Mr, with their winter quarters near the cities of Shuster and Dizful. They are a brave and hardy race, devoted to rapine and plunder, and lineally descended from those terrible mountaineers who opposed the advance of Alexander the Great, and routed the armies of Eome in the height of her power. They number about 100,000 families. To the south-east of the Bakhtiyaris, and near Shir&amp;z, are the Menasenni, who claim descent from Zal and Rustam. They are noted robbers, and possess an almost impregnable stronghold at Kaleh or ' The White Castle.' Such were the forces with which 'Aly Murdan, chief of the Bakhtiyaris, with the assistance of his rich brother, formed an army to conquer the kingdom of Persia. It was in 1749 that 'Aly Murdan, then a very old man, suddenly seized upon the city of Isfahan, and drove out the governor who held it in the name of Shah Eokh, the representative of Nadir. 1 Morier on Ilydts oj Persia, 1837 ; Layard's Khuzistan, 1846 ; Rawlinson on KMzistdn and Luristan, 1838 ; Baron de Bode on Khuzistdn, 1841; Lieut.

The Zand tribe is a branch of the numerous Lak tribe, which is subdivided into many clans, and scat tered over various parts of Persia. They date their origin from the time of the Kaianian dynasty; and the Zands declare that their ancestors were charged with the care of the Zand Avesta, by the great prophet Zoroaster himself. The Laks number about 20,000 families, and are renowned for being great thieves. J Aly Murdan and Karim Khan, the chiefs of the Bakhtiyari and Zand tribes, raised up a puppet of the Sufawi family, a nephew of the unfortunate Shah Sultan Husain, with the empty title of Isma'il III. 'Aly Murdan became commander-in-chief, and Karim Khan was WaMl, or minister to this royal puppet. The Wakil displayed his excellent qualities, from the time of his first rise to power, in protecting the Isfah- anis, and particularly the Armenians of Julfa, from all injustice. In 1751 the aged Bakhtiyari chief was assassinated, and the whole weight of the government of Pars fell upon the virtuous and patriotic Karim. He summoned the Zand and other tribes of Persian origin, and urged them to join him in throwing off the hateful yoke of Turks and Afghans, under which Iran had so often groaned, and which again threatened to fall upon her more heavily than ever. The two most powerful enemies of Karim were 1 Karim means 1 Bountiful/ y I fli fa : ' : Ij 11 i322 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Azwad Khan, the Afghan governor of Azarbaijan, and Muhammad Hnsain Khan, chief of the Kajars. In 1752 Karim was entirely defeated by Azwad Khan near Kazvin, and forced not only to abandon the cities of Isfahan and Shiraz, but to retreat into the mountains between Shiraz and the Garmstr, ' Eegion of Heat,' as the plains bordering on the shores of the Persian Gulf and the lower valleys are called. When Azwad KMn, flushed with victory, advanced to attack him, the Wakil posted his forces in the narrow pass of Kamara, while Eustam, the friendly chief of Khisht, occupied the heights on either side, and fired down upon the foe. The troops of Azwad were thrown into irremediable confusion, and Karim's victory was complete. The Afghan chief threw himself on the clemency of the conqueror, and lived for many years in safety and honour at the court of his successful rival. Azwad was the last chief of any note of the Ghilzi tribe. 1 Muhammad Husain Khan, chief of the Kajars, who had seized upon Mazandaran and Ghilan after the death of Nadir Shah, now became Karim's most dangerous and powerful enemy. At the head of a great army, the Kajar marched through 'Irak and Fars, and besieged the city of Shir&amp;z itself, 2 in 1757. But here his career was checked. The garrison made frequent sallies, the Zand horse cut off his supplies, 1 Mountstuart Elphinstone's Afg 2 In digging the foundations for a cotton-press near the Isfahan gate at Shirlz, Major St. John came upon vestiges of this siege in the shape of a deposit of human bones and broken and decayed swords and guns.KAEIM KHAN ZAND. 323 and at length lie was forced to make a rapid retreat across the whole breadth of Persia, to Mazandaran. Karim followed him slowly, and was received with demonstrations of joy and affection by the people of Isfahan, where he remained to re-establish tranquillity in the provinces of Fars and 'Irak. Meanwhile his gene ral, Shaikh 'Aly Khan, advanced to the north, entirely defeated the Kajars, and put their formidable chief to death. His eldest son, Agha Muhammad, surrendered himself a prisoner, and was treated with all possible kindness by the generous Karim, who lodged him in the palace at Shiraz. His second son, Husain Kuly, 1 was attacked at Damghan, in Khurasan, by Zaky Khan, the brother of Karim, and forced to take shelter amongst the Turkmans, who murdered him in 1763. Zaky Khan, who was as cruel as his brother was generous and humane, planted his prisoners in avenues with their heads downwards. In 1760, Karim Khan Zand, the Wakil, thus found himself in unopposed possession of the whole of Persia, with the exception of Georgia and Khurasan; and he devoted the remainder of his life to the happiness of his people, and the internal improvement of his country. The Sufawi puppet, Isma'il III., was sent to the small walled town of Ahddeh, on the road between Persepolis and Isfahan ; while the Wakil chose the city of Shiraz for the seat of his government. Various causes com bined to induce him to make this choice, among which were the love its citizens had always borne him, its 1 Father of Fat-li 'Aly, late Shah of Persia, y 2324 HISTORY OF PERSIA. great beauty, its proximity to the powerful tribes in the mountains of Luristan—the chief supporters of Karim's power—its central position, and its convenient distance from Bushire, a town which had become the chief emporium for trade in the Persian Gulf. The city of Shiraz—the home of Sa'ady and of HMzh—has been celebrated for its beauty, and de lightful situation, from the earliest times. It is situated in a fine, well cultivated plain, surrounded by moun tains, about 20 miles long and G broad; bounded on the south-east by the salt lake of Mahalu. Shiraz is a little more than three miles round, and consists, like all Persian cities, of houses with flat roofs, forming narrow lanes ; the private dwellings are better built and more richly ornamented than in Isfahan and Tehran. The lofty domes of the mosques, covered with lacquered turquoise blue tiles, and the minarets surmounted by gilded crescents, seen afar through the cypress and plane trees, enrich the view. Karlm Khan built the great bazar of Shiraz, called Bazar- i- Wakil, which is the finest in Persia. It is a quarter of a mile long, built of yellow bricks, arched at the top, and lighted with numerous skylights. On each side of the central path are chambers, before which raised booths are constructed, and under them the traders sit, with their goods beside them; while the chambers behind contain the remainder of their stock. The arh, or citadel of Shiraz, is a fortified space, about 80 yards square, which contains a richly furnished palace, built by the Wakil for his harem. In the vicinity of the city are numerous beautifulSHlRAZ. 325 gardens. The most famous is the Jahan Numa, or ' Epitome of the World'—where the cypress-trees, which line the walks, are the tallest and largest that were anywhere to be found. Intermixed with these are broad spreading chenars (plane trees), all manner of fruits, and abundance of roses and jessamine. Close to this garden flows the classic stream of Eoknabad. 1 In a small neighbouring garden a tomb was erected over the remains of the poet Hafizh, by Karim Khan, and a copy of his works is kept near it as a monument of his mind. The Wakil also repaired the tomb of the immortal Sa'ady. The vineyards in the vicinity are very extensive, and the wine of Shiraz, which is very strong, is famous throughout the East. There are also many large rose gardens, the roses being cultivated to extract rose-water; and 2,000 chests, containing 12 English gallons, in thin glass bottles, used to be exported annually. 2 Karim Khan improved and ornamented Shinlz, and beautified its environs. During his time the people 'passed their leisure hours in the society of moon faced damsels, the sparkling goblet circulated, and love and pleasure reigned in every breast.' There were 10,000 houses, so that the population must have been 1 General Monteitli says it is only two or three feet wide, but it is a perennial stream of clear water. 2 Before the time of Karim Khan, Sir Thomas Herbert, Garcia de Silva, Pietro della Yalle ( a.d . 1622), Sir John Chardin, M. Tavernier, and Capt. Alex. Hamilton ( a.d . 1688-1723), have described Shiraz. Since his time Sir Harford Jones and others have been charmed by the beauties of this city and its environs. Mr. Rich and Mr. Fraser, whose opinions are very unfavourable, were unwell when they visited it. The former died there.826 HISTORY OF PERSIA. 50,000 ; while at tlie date of Sir John Malcolm's visit, in 1810, it barely reckoned 20,000 souls. 1 Under the rule of Karim Khan commerce and agri culture rapidly revived; and in 1757 the British factory was removed from Gombrun to Bushire, about 165 miles from Shiraz by the road. Seventy miles west of Shiraz, through a mountainous and well-wooded country, is the town of Kazeriin. There are two steep and difficult passes on the road, one called DoJctar, ' daughter, or maiden,' eleven miles; the other, Pir-i-zan, 1 old woman,' eighteen miles from Kazerun. This town is situated in a valley thirty miles long and eight broad, fertilized by a number of rivulets. The crops are abundant, but sometimes they are de stroyed by clouds of locusts. 2 At the end of the valley, fourteen miles from Kazerun, are the ruins of the ancient Shapur, once a fine city, in a wild spot amidst rocks and precipices, many of which are sculptured. A rapid stream rushes past the ruins. Kazerun is 95 miles from Bushire. The first 47 miles are through deep and intricate defiles, or along frightful precipices; but from Daliki, a village at the foot of the mountains, a plain extends to the seashore. The town of Bushire is situated at the northern extremity of a sandy peninsula, eleven miles long, and four broad in the widest part. The town is on all sides surrounded by the sea, except on the south, where a stone wall is built. The inhabitants suffer from the 1 It has now from 35,000 to 40,000. 2 Kazerun was the capital of Firfiz, grandson of Varahran 66r of the Sassanian dynasty.KARIM KHiN ZAND. 327 excessive heat, the thermometer in August being usually 98° in the shade, and above the flat roofs of many of the houses a bddgtr, or ' wind-catcher,' is erected ; a tower open at each side, which acts as a funnel, and cools the houses. The water at Bushire is very bad, and the surrounding flat and sandy country abounds in antelopes. The outer road is six miles from the town, and ships, exceeding 300 tons, cannot come closer in. Karim Khun reduced all the inhabitants of the Persian coast of the gulf to subjection. The Cha'ab Arabs, who inhabit the seashore between the mouths of the Taab and Karun, agreed to pay him tribute in 1762, and his brother, Sadik Khan, besieged and captured cl-Basrah in 1775. The trade along the coast, under the wise regulations of the Wakil, became very considerable, and quantities of raw silk and bullion were exchanged at Bushire for European goods. About this time. Baron Kniphausen, with Dutch ships from Batavia, occupied Karak, an island con taining about twelve square miles, thirty miles from Bushire. Karak possesses a safe anchorage ; there is abundance of water from wells, besides a spring rising in the higher parts, and though the greater part of the island is rocky, the eastern extremity is capable of cultivation. The Dutch fortified Karak, and held it for eleven years, during which time it became a flourishing settlement, and a great emporium of trade for the Persian Gulf. 1 Karim KMn Zand died at Shiraz in the year 1779, 1 The Dutch, held Karak from 1754 to 1765.

Being the son of a petty chief of a wandering tribe, he had received no education, yet he venerated the memory of Hafizli and of Sa'ady. He was distinguished by a manly simplicity of mind, those enemies who fell into his power were freely pardoned; and though usually gay and cheerful, he attended carefully to his religious duties. The Wakil was very anxious to suppress robbery, and render the roads throughout Persia safe for travellers. It is related that on one occasion a man rushed rudely into his presence, calling out loudly for justice. ' Who are you ?' asked Karim. ' A merchant,' answered the fellow, ' and have been robbed by some thieves.' ' What were you about when you were robbed ?' ' I was asleep.' ' And why did you sleep ?' 'Because,' answered the man boldly, 'I made a mistake, and thought you were awake.' Karim was pleased with the plain-spoken merchant, and ordered him at once to be paid the amount of his losses. The memory of this great and good man is still revered by the Persians, and his name is immor talised in the splendid bazar and other buildings of Shirtiz. On the death of Karim Khan his cruel brother Zaky assumed the government, but proclaimed Abdul father, brother, two sisters, and two children, took Karak from the Dutch in 1765.SUCCESSORS OF KAIilM KHAN. 329 Fat-li, son of the late sovereign, to be his successor. Several years of miserable anarchy followed. Sadik, Kerim's other brother, on hearing of his death, evacuated his conquest at el-Basrah, and marched towards Shiraz with his son Ja'afar, but was forced to retreat to Kirman. The most important event was the escape of Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar, who fled hastily to Mazandaran, placed himself at the head of his powerful tribe at Astrabad, and de clared himself a competitor for the crown of Persia in 1779. Zaky sent his nephew, 'Aly Murad, against him, who, however, revolted against his uncle and occupied Isfahan. The infuriated Zaky advanced with a large force to punish the rebels, as far as the romantic town Yazdikhast, which is situated on the summit of a perpendicular rock in a broad ravine. The tyrant demanded payment of a sum of money which the in habitants were unable to raise, and he ordered eighteen of the chief men of the place to be hurled from a window down the precipice. Never did retribution follow so rapidly on crime. Almost instantly the in habitants rose in rebellion, and punished the murderer with death. On hearing of Zaky's end, his brother Sadik hastened to Shiraz, and put out the eyes of Abdu-1- Fat-h, the ill-fated son of Karim KMn. But AJy Murad advanced from Isfahan, seized Shiraz, and put Sadik to death, though he spared his son Ja'afar Khan. AJy Murad reigned over Persia until 1785, and330 HISTORY OF PERSIA. carried on a successful war witli Agha Muhammad, in Mazandaran, defeating him in several engagements, and occupying Tehran and Sari. 'Aly Murad was succeeded by Ja'afar Khan, the son of Sadik, who was also successful in his war against Agha Muhammad. Ja'afar reigned at Shiraz, and was assisted in the government by a remarkably clever but unprincipled man of Jewish origin, named Hajji Ibra him, who was appointed Ka or chief magistrate of the city. Ja'afar's son, named Lutf 1 Aly Khan, was a brave and warlike young prince, and was em ployed during his father's reign in subduing the pro vince of Lar. In 1789 two conspirators named Seyyid Murad and Hajji 'Aly Kuly, governor of Kazerim, succeeded in poisoning Ja'afar; and, cutting off his head, they threw it into the courtyard of the palace at Shiraz. Seyyid Murad proclaimed himself king, but the wily Hajji Ibrahim managed to preserve the loyalty of the citizens, the upstart was killed, and the youthful Lutf Aly Khan, who hastened to Shiraz on hearing of his father s death, was welcomed by the inhabitants, and was proclaimed sovereign of Persia by Hajji Ibrahim, who became his chief adviser. Mirza Husain, another native of Shiraz, received the appointment of wazir. At the time of his accession, Lutf ' Al y Khan was only in his twentieth year, very handsome, tall, and graceful, brave as the hero Kustam, and, like him, an excellent horseman. His beautiful horse 1 Lutf 'Aly, ' the favour of 'Aly.'LUTF 'ALY KHAN. 331 revived the memory of Rehsh in the minds of the people of Iran. To his fearless bravery and indomitable perseverance Lutf ? Aly united the nobler virtues of generosity and magnanimity. He formed many en during friendships; and, though false-hearted traitors forsook him in the hour of adversity, others nobly stood by him to the last. Though differing widely in character, Lutf 'Aly Khan was a worthy successor of Karim KMn, the great founder of the Zand dynasty. He had not been many months on the throne when Agha Muhammad advanced to attack him, and in vested the city of Shiraz, but retreated soon afterwards to Tehran, which he had made the capital of his dominions. The young king then enjoyed a short period of peace. It was at this time that Sir Harford Jones, who had visited Shiraz for the first time in 1786, came to the court of Lutf 'Aly Khan. We may judge of the impression it left on his mind, from his mourn ful feelings when he again passed through Shiraz in 1808. 6 1 am now in Shiraz! 5 he says, 6 but with what different feelings to those experienced in my former visit to this city. Where is the noble sovereign, the true lion of war, to whose presence I was familiarly admitted whenever I chose to seek the honour ? Be trayed and cruelly destroyed. Where is the royal child whose innocent tattle gave me so much pleasure? Alas ! alive, but most inhumanly mutilated. Where is the scoundrel whose mad ambition and black heart brought ruin on his confiding king, and misery the most severe on his fellow-citizens? Gone, I hope,332 HISTORY OF PERSIA. trust, and believe, to receive a just punishment for his most atrocious villanies. Where is that great, good, and amiable minister, Mirza Husain, whose conversation was a charm, and whose hospitable mansion was always open to me ? Where are many other kind friends with whom, when Persia was a new world to me, I rambled about, and loitered, or feasted in the garden of the Wakil, or by the tomb of Sa'ady ? Gone! gone for ever!' During the few short months of Lutf 'Aly KMn's prosperity, ShMz saw the last of her happy days. Outside the walls of the city Karim Khan had caused a long straight road, 120 feet wide, to be laid out, well gravelled, and planted on either side with chenar-trees. Here the courtiers of Lutf 'Aly's court would sit in the cool of the evening, and sip their iced sherbet, while many a pleasant party was formed in the neighbouring gardens. The ice was collected for the summer supply of the city at a place three miles north of ShMz. A high wall ran north and south, and at its foot on the north side there was a deep ditch. Near it the Eok- nabad was diverted from its course, into numerous shallow trenches. The water thus admitted was frozen over in the night, and in the morning the ice was shovelled into the large ditch, which, when full, was covered over and secured from the action of the air. The fruits of ShMz were cooled by frozen snow, which is preserved in caverns of the surrounding Mountains. In the year 1790 Lutf'Aly Khan collected his forces, and marched against the Kajars, in the direction of, Sil LUTF 'ALT KHAN. 333 IsfaMn. But that 'black-hearted villain,' Hajji Ibrahim, had been intriguing against his kind young sovereign, to whose family he owed everything, not only in the army, but also with Agha Muhammad, the chief of the Kajars, and arch-enemy of the Zands. Lutf 'Aly Khan was suddenly deserted by the whole of his army, except seventy faithful followers ; and when he retreated to Shiraz, he found the gates closed against him by that Hajji Ibrahim, who held the city for the Kajar chief. The unfortunate young prince retreated to Bushire, but the Shaikh of that town had also betrayed him. Surrounded by treason on every side, basely deserted alike by his dearest friends and by those who had been raised from the dust by his family, to most men there would have appeared no hope but in flight. The lion-hearted Zand, however, was a worthy countryman of the heroic Eustam. Undaunted by the black clouds that gathered round him, with his little band he boldly attacked and defeated the Shaikh of Bushire, and blockaded the city of Shiraz. His unconquerable valour gained him many followers, and he defeated an army sent against him by the Kajar in 1792. Agha Muhammad then advanced in person against his gallant young rival. He encamped with an army of 30,000 men on the plain of Mardasht, near Shiraz, which, where uncultivated, is covered with the liquorice plant. Lutf 'Aly Khan, in the dead of night, suddenly attacked the camp of his enemy with only a few hun dred followers. The Kajars were completely routed and thrown into confusion; but Agha Muhammad, | ' mi : v • ■ f v r i-V ■ I 1 ; I I i| : / : i ; h;:!!: . rill 11 U 1334 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. with extraordinary presence of mind, remained in his tent, and at the first appearance of dawn his nm'azhin was ordered to call the faithful to morning prayer as usual. Astonished at this, the handful of Zand cavalry thought that the whole army of Kajars had returned, and they fled with precipitation, leaving the field in possession of Agha Muhammad. The success ful Kajar then entered Shiraz, which the traitor Hajji Ibrahim, whom he promoted to be his wazir, had held for several months in his name. Lutf 'Aly Khan took refuge with the hospitable chief of Tabbas, in the south part of Khurasan. The small khanat of Tabbas, 396 miles south of Mash-had, and 244 north of Kirman, is surrounded by a sandy desert for thirty miles, in every direction. On the road from Kinnan there are quicksands in the desert where camels, horses, and men are often swallowed up, and the sand flows in strong winds, and buries every unfortunate whose path it crosses. The town of Tabbas is rudely fortified, and carries on a traffic in sheep and camels, which are bred in great numbers. An Arab tribe, named Benu Shaiban, had been settled in this distant spot since the time of theKhalifahs; and their chief, named Mir Husain Khan, a sensible and honourable man, hospitably received the fugitive prince. Lutf 'Aly KMn succeeded in collecting a few fol lowers at Tabbas, and advanced into Fars, but was again defeated, and forced to take refuge at Kandahar. In 17 94, however, the undaunted young prince once more advanced into Persia, determined to make a last effort, and either regain his throne, or die in theLUTF 'ALY KHAN. 335 attempt. He occupied the city of Kir man, and, says his historian, ' the fortune of this prince, like the splendour of the meteor which he resembled, shone brightest at the moment of its close.' 1 Kirman, at the time that Ormuz and Gombrun were the chief ports of Persia, was a flourishing commercial town, being half-way between the Persian Gulf and the province of Khurasan. It had a very fine bazar, and was well fortified. Agha Muhammad besieged it with a large army in 1795, and after a gallant resistance the gates were opened through treachery. For three hours the gallant young prince fought in the streets with determined valour, but in vain. When he saw that all hope was gone, he spurred his faithful horse against the ranks of the enemy, and, with only three followers, fought his way through the Kajar host, and escaped to Narmashir, the most eastern district of the province of Kirm&amp;n, on the borders of Sistan. Furious at the escape of his rival, the savage con queror ordered a general massacre ; 20,000 women and children were sold into slavery, and 70,000 eyes of the inhabitants of Kirman were brought to Agha Mu hammad on a platter. The monster counted them with the point of his dagger, then, turning to his minister, he exclaimed, ' If one had been wanting, I would have made up the number with your own eyes.' Kirman has never fully recovered from the effects of this fiend's atrocities. The district of Bam-Karmashir, the last abiding place 1 'Aly Edzha's ' History of the Zand Family,' from Malcolm's History of Persia.336 HISTORY OF PERSIA. of the ill-starred Lutf 'Aly, is 90 miles long by 40 broad; with a range of mountains to the south, whose summits are covered with snow. The soil is fertile, and the district is well watered by streams from the mountains. Besides Bam, the capital, there are the little towns of Eigan, Kuruk and others, which are surrounded by mud walls, within which the cattle are driven every night for protection from the predatory incursions of the Baluchis. The fort of Bam has a high mud wall, flanked with towers, a broad dry ditch, and only one gate. Outside the ramparts is a bazar, supplied with milk, dates, and other fruit. Part of Narmashir is fertile and well cultivated, but it is surrounded by wild deserts and mountains. 1 The fugitive prince took refuge in the town of Bam; but the governor of Narmashir, anxious to propitiate the conqueror, basely surrounded him, as he was mounting his faithful horse Koraun, to seek a more secure asylum. The young prince fought bravely; but, being badly wounded, and overpowered by num bers, he was secured, and sent to the camp of the Kaj ar chief. The spot where he was seized at Bam, when mount ing his horse, is marked by a pyramid, formed, by order of his cruel conqueror, of the skulls of the most faithful of his adherents. The most hideous indignities and atrocities were committed upon his person by the brutal Kajar, in 1 Pottinger travelled through Narmaslur in 1810. He was at Rigan on April 23, and at Bam on the 28th. It has since been visited by Mr. Keith Abbott, Sir Frederic Goldsmid, and Major St. John.LUTF 'ALY KHAN. 337 whose breast not one spark of generous or humane feeling had ever found a place. Finally, the last reigning prince of the house of Zand was sent to Teh ran and murdered, when only in his twenty-sixth year. Every member of his family and every friend was ordered to be massacred by Agha Muhammad; and the successful but guilty miscreant thus founded the blundering dynasty of the Kajars, at the price of all the best and noblest blood of Iran. The Zand dynasty produced two great and worthy scions. Karim Khan by his justice, humanity, and wisdom, preserved the distracted realm of Persia in peace and prosperity for a period of twenty years; and the adventures of Lutf 'Aly, his youth, his in domitable perseverance and heroic fortitude, throw a halo of glory over the last days of his ill-fated house. The Kajars, raised to power by the hideous atrocities of that monster Agha Muhammad, have supplanted their rivals, and still continue to reign. They are of Turk origin, while the Zands were Persian; and it is certain that Iran has not prospered under her present rulers. Khusru, the son of Lutf 'Aly Khan, though cruelly mutilated, was allowed to live at the court of his father's murderer; and when Sir Harford Jones was in the royal camp in 1810, Fat-h 'Aly, the reigning Shah, allowed him to have an interview with the unfortunate youth. Young Khusru was sent to the ambassador's tent, his father's former friend, and, clasping him in his li ! i liiii i i'l 11 ^ fjjj338 HISTORY OF PERSIA. arms, burst into a violent flood of tears. They talked over the happy times at Shiraz, now gone for ever; and, on taking leave, the young prince exclaimed, ' I bless God I have lived to see two things. The one, that I saw that scoundrel Hajji Ibrahim deprived of sight; the other, that I have conversed with you.' On the same occasion, Fat-h 'Aly Shah said, that if he, instead of his uncle, Agha Muhammad, had captured Lutf 'Aly Khan, he never would have suffered such cruel indignities. ' He was a true and noble lion.' 1 1 ZAND TEIBE.

Reign of Agha Mu Since the fall of the noble family of Zand, Persia has been governed by one of the tribes of Turan, a Tilrk family, called the Kajars, which first appeared in Persia in the invading army of Jingiz-KMn. Timur banished them to Syria; but, yielding to the prayer of the holy Shla'ah saint at Ardebil, he afterwards allowed them to return, and they became one of the seven Kuzil- Msh tribes which supported Shah Isma'il when he founded the Sufawi dynasty. The first chief of the Kajars, mentioned in history, is Pir BMah Khan, who was appointed governor of Kandahar by Shah Tahmasp I. 'Abbas the Great established some of the Kajars at Merv, others in Erivan and at Kazvin; but the great body of them was settled at AstraMd, near the south-eastern corner of the Caspian Sea. The tribe was divided into five clans: namely, the Yokari^ or senior branch, the Ashdka, the Devehlu, the Shambeyati, and the 1 Yokari bash means 4 upper head.' z 2340 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Kazvini. The Yokari chief had always been looked upon as head of the tribe, until Fat-h 'Aly Khan, of the Ashaka, 1 became general of the army of the un fortunate Tahmasp II., when that branch assumed, and has ever since retained, the ascendancy. Fat-h 'Aly Khan was murdered by Nadir; and his son, Muhammad Husain Khan, after a long exile amongst the Turkmans, and an unsuccessful attack on Astrabad during Nadir's reign, was finally killed in a battle with Kerim Khan's army. His eldest son, Agha Muhammad, who had been taken prisoner by Nadir when his father attacked Astrabad, was cruelly mutilated by Adil Shah, but afterwards escaped and joined his father. On the death of Muhammad Husain, his son, Aglia Muhammad, surrendered himself into the hands of Karim Khan, who detained him at Shiraz, but treated him with kindness and consideration. The good old 'Wakil early observed his extraordinary cunning and ability, and used to call him Piran Wisa, after the famous Wazir of Afrasiab. But the young viper cherished a secret hatred against his benefactor, and, as he afterwards confessed, used to gratify his impotent malice by secretly cutting up the borders of the rich carpets in the Wakil's palace. On the death of Karim Khan, Agha Muhammad escaped to Mazandaran; and, after more than ten years of war, he captured Kirman, and cruelly murdered his 1 Mr. Morier, in his paper on the llytits, called this branch, to which the royal family belongs, the Kavanlfi.AGHA MUHAMMAD. 341 chivalrous young rival, Lutf 'Aly Khan. Thus, in 1794, he found himself in undisputed possession of the greater part of Persia; the traitor Hajji Ibrahim became his wazir, and he fixed his capital at Tehran. Before obtaining supreme power in Persia, Agha Muhammad had come in contact with the Eussians, his future foes, and the most dangerous enemies of Persia; but, on this occasion, the Kajar completely outwitted the Muscovite. In July, 1781, the Eussian Voinovitch sailed from Astrakhan to AstraMd with four frigates and two armed sloops. Agha Muhammad being in the neigh bourhood, Voinovitch requested permission to build a counting-house ! on the coast. The Kajar chief, con sidering that he was unable to drive the Eussians away by force, determined to fight them with their own weapon—artifice. He pretended to accede to the wishes of Voinovitch, and the counting-house turned out to be a fort with 18 guns, which the Eussians built, about 50 miles from Astrabad. Agha Muhammad paid a visit to the Eussians, admired their work, and then invited Voinovitch, and all his officers, to dine with him, at one of his hunting lodges, in the mountains. On their arrival he put them in irons, and declared he would put them to death if the fort was not instantly razed to the ground. Voinovitch, knowing that the Kajar would be as good as his word, signed an order; the cannon were taken on board again, and the walls of the fort knocked down. Agha Muhammad then342 HISTORY OF PERSIA. loaded the Eussian officers with scornful abuse, and had them whipped down to their ships. 1 During the long struggle for power with the Zand princes, Agha Muhammad had used the provinces of Mazandaran, Astrabad, and Ghilan, as the base of his operations, with his head-quarters in the town of Sari. These three provinces occupy the long strip of country which intervenes between the lofty chain of the Elburz Mountains and the southern shores of the Caspian. The province of Astrabad is bounded on the north by the Caspian, and the river Gurgan which divides it from the Tiirkmlin wilderness. This river drains the valleys on the northern side of the mountains of Khurasan, and flows through woods of oaks, beech, and alder, with vines hanging in festoons from them. The ground is covered with beautiful flowers, and thorn trees with a white blossom; and rich pastures alternate with the woods, on either side of the Gurgan, until it falls into the Caspian. The town of Astrabad, the head-quarters of the Kajar tribe, is surrounded by a wall about three miles round, and thick forests approach it on all sides. The houses are built of wood, with verandahs resting on wooden pillars, a high pitched roof covered with red tiles, and frequently a lofty wind tower. The bazars are also roofed with tiles, instead of being arched, as is usual in Persia, and many of the streets are paved. The houses are surrounded by trees and 1 Progress and Present Position (2nd ed. 1838), pp. 33-4.PROVINCE OF MAZANDARAN. gardens, and luxuriant vegetation is everywhere to be seen, consisting chiefly of fine old chenars, tall cypresses, and fruit trees. From the hills above the town there is a magnificent view. To the east and south is the Elburz range of mountains, the lower slopes thickly clothed in dark green wood, and their snowy summits usually hid in mist. To the north and north-east is the rich valley of the Gurgan, diversified with villages, pastures, and forests, and bounded by the distant Turkman desert. To the north-west are the forests and cultivated lands of Mazandaran, and the wide expanse of the Caspian Sea. The province of Mazandaran, bounded on the west by Ghilan, and on the east by Astrabad, is about thirty miles wide in its broadest part, and is traversed by several large rivers, which rise in the Elburz Mountains and fall into the Caspian. The whole of this region is covered with luxuriant vegetation. The road from Astrabad to Sari, the capital of Mazandaran, leads along the famous causeway of Shah 'Abbas the Great, which is formed by filling a deep trench with small stones, and laying a regular cause way of larger stones over them. Although it has never been repaired, this great work is still in tolerable preservation, and the swampy forests of Mazandaran would be almost impervious without it. The causeway leads through thick jungle, chiefly of thorns and brambles, but interspersed with large forest trees; and occasionally a village, surrounded with cultivated land, is passed. Ashraf, the favourite344 HISTORY OF PERSIA. palace of Shah 'Abbas, is now completely fallen to ruin. Sari, the capital of 'the province, is about two miles round, with a wall and ditch. The houses are built of burnt brick, and roofed with red and green glazed tiles ; there are orange and other trees in several of the streets, and the town is surrounded by large orange gardens. Agha Muhammad resided at Sari for many years, during his struggle for power, and built a palace there. It is a mixture of dark passages, courts containing tanks, and a few fine rooms. The diwan-hMnah, or ' hall of audience,' is adorned with mirrors and pictures, out of perspective, representing the victories of Shah Isma'il and Nadir Shall. In the neighbourhood of Sari there was, till very lately, a curious monument of antiquity. Hanway believed it to be a Ghebre temple, and Eraser thinks it was a monument to some prince of the Dilami dynasty. It was a lofty tower, known as the Gumbuz- e-Selm-e-Tur, 100 feet high, 30 feet in diameter, hollow to the top without a staircase, and built of burnt brick and mortar. It must have closely re sembled the round towers of Ireland, There were two belts of inscriptions round the outside, on green lacquered bricks. When Colonel Stuart visited Sari in 1835, this tower had been completely destroyed by an earthquake. Some miles west of the capital, are the ruins of the palace of Furrahbad, where Shah 'Abbas died in 1628. The road leads through a country varied by forests and cultivation, and the palace was built on a wide! I provinoe of mazandarAn. 345 plain, rich in meadow grass and clover. There was once a large garden round the palace, in which there was a tower, from whose summit Shah 'Abbas was wont to enjoy a magnificent view of the Caspian. About twenty miles WNW. of Sari is the thriving town of Barfurush, near the banks of the river Bhawal. It is surrounded by forests of splendid trees, with vines festooning gracefully from the branches, while the ground is covered with blue-bells, dandelions, forget- me-nots, and butter-cups. The houses of the town are scattered among fields and gardens. The bazar, a mile long, is well built and roofed with tiles, and there are ten caravanserais. Near Barfurush there is a garden in the middle of a lake, laid out by SMh Abbas, and called '• the Sea of Paradise.' The lake, two miles in cir cumference, is overgrown with water-lilies; and the island garden is covered with orange-trees, roses, and cypresses. It is approached by a long wooden bridge, on brick piers. The banks of the lake are surrounded by weeping willows, and beyond there is a fine wooded country, with the snowy peak of Demavend in the background. At the mouth of the Bhawal, the river of Barfurush, is the village of Mash-had-i-sar, one of the chief ports of Mazandar^n. The Caspian, on its southern shore, washes a sandy beach, beyond which is a thick, marshy forest. 1 Sturgeon and salmon, besides smaller fish, 1 On the beacli there is a broad ridge of sand hills, which are covered with wild pomegranates.—Information from General Mon- teith. •' if ■ ' ! | 11 Pi ■■ 4 M ■ m\v ill w ; | Si •. til846 HISTORY OF PERSIA. are caught in immense quantities, and the fishermen's nets are buoyed with gourds. Above Barfurush there is a handsome bridge over the Bhawal, of eight arches, erected by the father of Agha Muhammad; and twenty-two miles to the westward is the town of Amol on the river Heraz; where there is a very handsome shrine built by Shah 'AbMs, in honour of a descendant of Aly. The Heraz rises at the base of Demavend, and dashes through the rocky mountains and deep secluded ravines of the mountain chiefship of Larijan, before it finds its way into the plain, and flows past Amol into the Caspian. Ask, the capital of Larijan, is a village on the brow of a hill which overhangs the Heraz, and the splendid peak of Demavend rises immediately above it. The dense vegetation and swampy soil of the plains of Mazandar^n produce so much disease, that most of the inhabitants retire to Larijan, and other cool retreats in the Elburz Mountains, during the summer heats. The people of Mazandaran are a very handsome race, with Jewish features ; and are remarkable for their civility; but, like every other Persian province, this family inheritance of the Kajars has suffered terribly under their rule. Mazandaran is bounded on the west by Ghilan, a province also well covered with vegetation, and stretch ing along the shores of the Caspian for 200 miles. The northern part of Ghilan includes a portion of the mountainous district of Talish, which is inhabited by wild tribes. The coast is lined with a belt of almost' impenetrable forest; and the whole province is coveredPROVINCE OF GHILAN. with an impervious jungle, excepting where it is cleared away for the cultivation of rice and mulberry trees. The villagers retreat from the unhealthy low lands, to the summer pastures in the mountains, to avoid the fevers of the hot weather ; returning in the winter. Eesht, the capital of Ghilan, 310 miles from Astrabad, and only six or seven from the Caspian Sea, is one of the most flourishing towns of Persia. The houses are of red brick, with wide, projecting roofs, covered with tiles, the streets well paved, and the bazars roofed over with tiles: but the town was until lately approached by execrable roads, which lead through thick forests reaching up to the very walls. Kesht is the chief mart for the silk of Ghilan, and carries on an extensive trade with Eussia. The road from Eesht to the seaport of Enzeli leads through a morass covered with thick forest. The river of Eesht empties itself into a creek, where there is a small village called Pir-i-bazdr, Here passengers and goods are embarked in boats, and are conveyed across a lake to the port. The lake of Enzeli, fringed with forest, is a large back-water, separated from the Caspian by a narrow strip of sand. It is about 35 miles long, by 12 to 15 broad, and is connected with the Caspian by a strait 500 yards broad 1 and a quarter of a mile long, deep enough for any vessel in the Caspian; but there is a bar outside on which the sea 1 General Monteith told me that tbe width of this strait varies, the sandy spits on either side constantly shifting. He said that the river, up to Resht, might be made navigable.348 HISTORY OF PEESIA. occasionally breaks. The town of Enzeli is situated on a low spit of sand, on the west side of the strait. It was until lately a miserable collection of reed houses ranged along the water side, with three brick caravan serais. When Colonel Monteith was there in 1828 there were about thirty vessels in port, of from 50 to 70 tons, chiefly from Baku and Astrakhan. The people of the three rich provinces of Ghilan, Mazandaran, and Astrabad, were the chief supporters of Agha Muhammad; and when he had possessed him self of supreme power by the murder of Lutf'Aly Khan, he established his capital at Tehran, a city only twelve miles from the feet of the Elburz Mountains, that he might be near Mazandaran and Astrabad. His first endeavour Was to cement his power by the blood of all his enemies. The noble family of Zand, and all those who had supported it, were exterminated. He then proceeded to murder his own relations; and enticed his brother into his power by promises of safety promises which the faithless monster kept by his instant assassination. These murders were intended both for his own safety, and to secure the accession of his nephew Fat-h 'Aly, son of his full brother, whom he appointed governor of Ears. But the new sovereign of Fersia also indulged in the most contemptible acts of mean revenge. The bones not only of Nadir Shah, the enemy of his race, but of the good and generous Karim Khan, the best ruler that Iran had known for centuries, were dug up and buried at the entrance of the palace gate at Tehran. While Persia was weakened by intestine dissensions,RUSSIAN TYRANNY. 349 the mighty power of Russia had rapidly increased, and the rulers of Turftn began to look, with greedy eyes, on the rich Persian provinces south of the Caucasus. The Empress Catherine, whose ambition was as in satiable as it was unscrupulous, then reigned at St. Petersburgh, and used every effort to extend her dominions in all directions. Unsparing bribery, in trigue, and finally open violence, were successively used to bring the victims of Russia within her clutches. At the end of 1770 a most remarkable and memor able protest was made against the tyranny and oppres sion of Russia. Two tribes of Kalmuck Tatars had settled in the steppes north of Astrakhan, and, by rear ing sheep and horses, had added immensely to the value of the land. For several years they endured the unrelenting exactions and tyranny of Russian officials, but at length an officer of Catherine's army, bearing the euphonious name of Kischenskoi, actually struck the chief of the Kalmucks, a venerable old man who had shed his blood in the service of Russia, and at the same time ordered one of his ministers to be flogged. The Kalmucks could endure the tyranny of their oppressors no longer. Collecting together their wives and little ones, their flocks and herds, the whole tribe, consisting of more than 70,000 families, started for their ancient home on the borders of China, leaving the steppes of Astrakhan a deserted wilderness. Kien Lung, the Mantchu Emperor of China, received them kindly, and assigned them vast pastures near the Great Wall. The demand of the Russians that they should be350 HISTORY OF PERSIA. delivered up was promptly refused; and when Catherine's ministers afterwards applied for a new treaty, they re ceived this memorable answer from the Court of Pekin, ' Let your mistress learn to keep old treaties, and then it will be time enough to apply for new ones.' The conquests of Eussia have usually been effected more by intrigue than by force of arms; and when the rich and beautiful provinces beyond the Caucasus began to excite the cupidity of Catherine, she en deavoured, in the first instance, to effect her object by bribes and offers of protection. The most important of the trans-Caucasian provinces is Georgia : which is bounded on the north by the lofty range of the Caucasus, on the north-west by a desert which separates it from Immeritia, on the west and south by hills which separate it from Armenia, and on the east by the Caspian provinces of Daghestan and Shirv&amp;n. It is a beautiful and fertile country, its hills are covered with splendid forests, and its plains are watered by numerous rivers. Tiflis, the capital, is built at the foot of a hill, on both sides of the river Kur. The men of Georgia are tall, handsome, and well formed, and the women are famous for their beauty throughout the East. A great part of the popu lation is Christian. On the north-west of Georgia are the provinces of Immeritia and Mingrelia, the ancient Colchis, on the shores of the Euxine. Mingrelia is a mountainous re gion, covered with extensive forests, and traversed by thirty rivers, the most famous of which is the Phasis, all falling into the Black Sea.GEOEGIA. 351 Dagliestan, on the west shores of the Caspian, is traversed by a stupendous range of mountains, in habited by the fierce and independent Lesghi? or Cir cassians. Darband, a seaport on the Caspian, is its capital. Shlrv&amp;n, to the south of Daghestan, extends along the Caspian to the plains of Mogan, which separate it from Azerbaijan. Its capital was Shumaka, but it also possesses the best seaport in the Caspian, the town of B&amp;ku. These provinces had been conquered by Shah Isma'il in 1500, and had remained provinces of Persia until the fall of the Sufawi dynasty. Heraclius, the Christian Prince of Georgia, who had learnt the art of war under Kadir Shah, had been induced, during the anarchy which followed that great conqueror's death, to place his country under of fatal protection of Eussia. The intrigues of Catherine's emissaries, working alter nately by bribes and flattery, had been but too suc cessful. 1 When Agha Muhammad had established himself in undisputed possession of the sovereignty of Persia, he thus found that both Georgia and Khur&amp;slin continued independent of his sway. He first turned his attention to the former province. In the year 1795 the Kajars, rendered formidable and expert in war by the long struggle with the Zands, and powerful in the numerous cavalry of the Ilyats, crossed the Araxes, and occupied Erivan and Shusha. 1 In 1768 the first Russian troops crossed the Caucasus, under General Toklabene.352 HISTORY OP PERSIA. Heraclius, wlio was then very old, drew up the Georgian army on a plain about fifteen miles south of Tiflis. He was entirely defeated, and Agha Muhammad occupied the capital of Georgia, and ordered a general massacre to be perpetrated. Every priest was murdered, and 15,000 women and children were sold into slaverv. Heraclius died of grief, shortly after this terrible disaster, and was succeeded by his son Gurgin Khan. Having subdued Georgia, the Kajar chief encamped on the plains of Mogan, where, early in 1796, he as sumed the title of SMh of Persia. A circular diadem, ornamented with pearls, was placed on his head, and his loins were girded with a sabre which had been consecrated at the shrine of Shah Isma'il, in Ardebil. Agha Muhammad Shah, the first sovereign of the Kajar dynasty, then turned his arms against Khurasan, whose chiefs retained a virtual independence, though owning a nominal allegiance to the blind Shah Eokh, who still ruled at Mash-had. The holy city was occu pied by his troops; and the unfortunate grandson of the mighty Nadir was tortured and murdered by the inhuman tyrant, to extort from him the jewels which had been brought from Delhi. While Agha Muhammad was in Khurasan, Catherine ordered her armies to march to the relief of the trans- Caucasian provinces. It must be confessed that the atrocities of the Kajar at Tiflis gave her a most justifi able pretext for advancing to the defence of her Chris tian allies ; but there can be no excuse for dethroning the successors of Heraclius, and seizing upon the rich provinces south of the Caucasus. The Kajar, byAGHA MUHAMMAD SHAH. 353 his cruelty, had justly forfeited them, but Eussia never had the shadow of a right to appropriate the spoils. In 1796 General Godovitch, with a force of 8,000 Eussians, entered Georgia by the Caucasus, while 35,000 men, under General Zuboff, marched, in the same direction, by the shores of the Caspian. Tiflis, Darband, Baku, and Talish were occupied ; the whole western shores of the Caspian, and the line of the Araxes, fell into the hands of the Eussians; and Zuboff encamped on the plains of Mogan, while detachments occupied the port of Lankoran, and threatened Enzeli, on the coast of Ghilan. Agha Muhammad Shah was furious when he heard of this formidable invasion, and collected his army in Khurasan, to repel the Eussians. With great sagacity he at once saw the best means of checking their ad vance, and rendering their conquests untenable, and he resisted the prayers of his eager chieftains, to be led at. once against the enemy. c Can a man of your wisdom,' he said to his minister, Hajji Ibrahim, c believe that I will ever run my head against their walls of steel, or expose my irregular army to be destroyed by their cannon and disciplined troops ? I know better. Their shot shall never reach me, but they shall possess no country beyond its range. They shall not know sleep; and let them march where they choose, I will surround them with a desert.' It would have been well for Persia if her Kajar rulers had ever borne these words in mind. 1 1 Hajji Ibrahim repeated these words to Sir John Malcolm in 1800. A A 'fPlI: im 1 1 ■ :r :| |1 i i354 HISTORY OF PERSIA. In 1797 Agha Muhammad left Tehran, and occu pied Shishah, on the banks of the Araxes. Here the career of the tyrant came to an abrupt conclusion. A dispute occurred between two servants outside his tent, and the Shah, enraged at the noise they made, ordered them both to be put to death on the following morn ing ; yet, with extraordinary temerity, he allowed them to continue their duties about his person in the inter val. Knowing that there was no chance of mercy, the poor wretches waited until the Shah was asleep, and then, very naturally, put an end to him with their daggers. 1 Such was the ignominious end of this inhuman mon ster, the founder of the Kajar dynasty. He was in his 63rd year, and as ugly in body as he was deformed in mind. He was very thin, with a beardless face, like a shrivelled old woman ; and, knowing how hideous he was, he could not endure anyone to look at him. Lady Sheil saw a portrait of him at Sulaimaniah. She says, ' He looks like a fiend. The atrocious, cold, calculating ferocity which marked the man is stamped on his countenance.' In comparison with this wretch, even Nadir Shah appears less wicked. The latter had many great qualities and extraordinary genius, while his cruelties were half forgotten when the Persians remembered that he had freed them from a foreign yoke, and made the name of Iran to be feared and respected by every enemy. But Agha Muhammad waded to the throne 1 The murderers were put to death by Fat-h 'Aly Shah.AG HA MUHAMMAD SHAH. 355 through a sea of blood; he perpetrated the most hideous acts of cruelty and ingratitude ; and committed revolting atrocities on the person of his brave and chivalrous rival, the ill-fated Lutf 'Aly Khan Zand. By such means did the present dynasty of Kajars obtain the Persian throne.356 HISTORY OF PERSIA. CHAPTEE XV. kajar dynasty. Reign of Fat -h Shah. (First half,—from 1798 to 1815.) O n the death of Agha Muhammad, the minister, Hajji Ibrahim, at once proclaimed Fat-h 'Aly; but it was not until 1798 that he arrived from Shiraz, and was crowned at Tehran. Fat-h Aly Shah was about thirty years of age when he ascended the throne. He was the son of Husain Kuly, own brother to Agha Muhammad; and when quite a child had been taken prisoner by the forces ot Karim Khan. But the good and humane Wakil ordered him to be sent back to his mother in Mazan- daran, and for the last twenty years he had lived under the protection of his terrible uncle, who had destined him for his successor. Agha Muhammad had murdered almost every re lation who was at all likely to dispute the throne; but there was one uncle left, named Sadik Khan, who rose in rebellion. Fat-h 'Aly Shah, who could boast of no personal courage, was obliged to take the field; but one or two shots from a or small pieceFAT-H 'ALY SHAH. 357 of camel artillery, made him fall from his horse in a swoon of terror. Old Hajji Ibrahim, to conceal the true state of the case, exclaimed, fi What a terrible passion the Father of the World has fallen into!' But, in spite of this timidity, Sadik Khan surrendered himself a prisoner, trusting to the sacred oath of his nephew that no violence should be used against him. The cruel Kajar, imitating the treachery of his pre decessor, shut him up in a room, closed up the doors and windows, and left him to die of starvation. When the doors were opened, some weeks afterwards, it was found that the wretched man had dug deep into the earth with his hands, and swallowed the clay to assuage his hunger. Having perpetrated this atrocity on his uncle, Fat-h 'Aly Shah turned his attention to the consolidation of his power. Tehran, which had been almost entirely destroyed by the Afghans, may be said to have been refounded by Agha Muhammad, and has ever since been the capital of Persia. Tehran is situated in a large plain, twelve miles south of the Elburz Mountains, and a few miles north west of the ruins of the ancient city of Ehe (the Ehages of the Apocrypha), which covers a consider able extent of ground, and has supplied some of the building materials for the modern city. The plain to the east and west of Tehran is populous; and many pretty villages nestle in the green defiles of the Elburz, to the north. On approaching the city, from the Isfahan road, a few domes and a great deal of verdure are visible above the walls. Tehran is about358 HISTORY OF PERSIA. eleven miles in circumference, surrounded by a cur tained and bastioned rampart and ditch, of modern profile. Two-thirds of the space included within the enceinte is still unbuilt on. The old streets are narrow, and the bazars inferior architecturally to those of Shiraz. The chief building of consequence is the Ark, or ' Citadel,' containing one of the palaces of the Shah; which consists of many apartments built round courts or maiddns, where chenar-trees are planted round large ornamental water tanks. The Ark was surrounded by a wall, with turrets, and a dry ditch, and was entered by a drawbridge. Three sides of the wall formed part of the outer fortification, and the remaining one was within the city. Immediately upon passing the drawbridge and the gate, there was a range of armourers' workshops, enclosed within an arched bazar, through which the road passed into the or square, entered by a gate which immediately faces the principal entrance of the palace, called the Dar-i- Tchdnah-Shdh, or ' Gate of the King's House.' It leads into the different courts, gardens, harems, and offices of the palace. Here Fat-h 'Aly Shah held his court during the winter months, and gave audiences in the khdnah, or ' hall of reception ;' where, seated on the famous peacock throne of Delhi, he blazed forth in the priceless jewels of JSIMir Shah. He was a man with regular features, a wasp-like waist, and the finest beard in the East, which reached down far below his waist. For a Persian king he was neither habitually cruel nor unjust; but insatiably avaricious, wantingFAT-H 'ALY SHAH. 359 in personal courage, and without any great ability. The government of Persia being a pure despotism, and the highest nobles being liable, at the caprice of the sovereign, to be put to death, robbed, or even beaten, few fine qualities can be expected from a Persian courtier, and the throne is surrounded by fulsome flattery. Yet the nobles of Irlki still possess the tall, upright figures, and fine features of their ancestors; and with these outward advantages, have inherited their talent and brilliant imaginations. Fat-h 'Aly, himself, was a poet; and his Laureate was an old chief, named Fat-h 'Aly Khan, whose ancestors had been, for several generations, the governors of Kashan. It is related that one day the Shah gave him some of his verses to read, and asked for his opinion of them. ' May my soul be your sacrifice,' said the Laureate, 'they are bosh.' The insulted sovereign exclaimed, ' He is an ass, take him to the stables ;' and the order was literally obeyed. After a short time his Majesty sent for him again, and read some more of his verses. The poet walked olf without a word. 'Where are you going ?' cried the Shah. ' Just back again to the stables,' answered his undaunted Laureate. Fat-h 'Aly, delighted with his boldness, called him back, and ordered his mouth to be stuffed with sugar-candy, a high mark of favour. Fat-b Alv Shall had innumerable wives, and before he died he had a hundred and fifty sons and twenty daughters. The Kajars, as a race, are exceedingly hand some, and may be known by their proud carriage, large black eyes, and well chiselled mouths. Most of the360 HISTORY OF PERSIA, sons of his Majesty were made governors of provinces; and the policy of the Kajar sovereigns has been to destroy the power of the great chiefs. The Persian nobles are very handsome, hospitable, and highly polished in their manners; but deceitful and haughty. Their bad qualities, however, are the fault of the wretched government under which they live. Their dress, in the days of Fat-h 'Aly, consisted of a black lambskin conical cap ; an open shawl surcoat reaching to the knee, with sleeves cut olf at the elbows ; and a shawl round the waist, in which a long dagger was stuck. When indoors they sit erect on their heels on namads, or thick felt rugs, and con verse while they smoke their or ' water-pipes,' and drink coffee. Their women, immured for life and uneducated, were dressed in a silk or muslin shift, a pair of velvet trowsers, and a vest. At present their dress is somewhat different, the dictates of fashion being variable in Tehran as in Paris. Though igno rant, they often enjoy considerable influence. They are taught, when young, to spin and embroider, and sometimes to read and write, but they are de graded to be the mere playthings of their lords; and the Persians will never be a civilized people until their women regain their rightful place in society—the position they held in the good old times of the Kai- anian kings. The house of a Persian nobleman is divided into several courts, in the most retired of which (called the AndarUn) is the Harem. The centre court (or Mat) is usually square, and divided into parterres\ - FAT-H 'ALY SHAH. 361 of flowers, with a fountain playing before the duvan- khanah. The walls of this apartment are adorned with paintings, and inlaid looking-glasses; and the floor is covered with carpets and namads. One entire side is taken up with large sash windows, often glazed with coloured glass, disposed in beautiful geo metric patterns. From the houses of Tehran there is a view of the Elburz Mountains, and of the snowy peak of Demavend, which towers high above the rest 1 —the ancient abode of the Div-i-Sajid, and the scene of Eustam's won drous exploits. During the three winter months snow falls in great quantities at Tehran. The Shah and his court then take up their abodes in the city. The Nao-Rdz, or Persian New Year's Day, is at the vernal equinox, and then the roses bloom in great abundance, and the nightingales begin their song. During the summer the heat is so excessive that the court re- 1 On September 4, 1837, Mr. Taylor Thompson, of the British Mission, left Ask, the capital of Larijan, which is forty-two miles E.N.E. of Tehran, and ascended to the summit of the peak of De mavend. The cold was excessive, but there was a sulphur cave on the summit, where the temperature was very high. There can be no doubt of the volcanic nature of Demavend. Demavend was again ascended in July 1858, by Lord Schomburg Kerr, and Mr. Eonald Thompson (Mr. Taylor Thompson's brother), attaches to Mr. Murray. They found the height to be 21,500 feet above the sea. Humboldt gives its height at 19,750 feet. On Mount Sevellan, above Ardebil, General Monteith saw the peak of Dema vend at a distance of 250 miles, across an angle of the Caspian. This mountain is plainly visible from the Caspian Sea by vessels going from Ashuradeh to Baku. In 1624 Herbert, one of Sir D. Cotton's suite, mentions this mountain as smoking. It is at present an inactive volcano.362 HISTORY OF PERSIA. moves to summer quarters in the Elburzchan Plain, and most of the nobles leave Tehran. True to the wandering habits of his Turkish ances tors, the Shah formed a vast camp, during the summer months, usually on the plain of Sultaniyah, or of Ujain. On one side of the camp were the SMh's quarters, surrounded by red canvas screens, called khandts or tejirs, so pitched as to represent the curtains and bastions of a fort, in an oblong form; and on each side were the tents of officers and guards. The royal enclosure was divided into three compartments: in the first was the diwdn-hhdnah, supported by three immense poles, each surmounted by a large golden ball. This tent covered an acre of ground. The second enclosure was called the and here Fat-h 'Aly had a tent lined throughout with Kashmir shawls; and behind this was the harem. Between the Shah's quarters and the first line of tents of the great officers of state was the an open space for reviewing the troops, and for parties to play at throwing the jerid. There were usually about 40,000 persons in the royal camp. The dress of the Shah, while in camp, was as magni ficent as when he sat in state at Tehran. Fat-h 'Aly wore a purple velvet coat, over which a network of small diamonds was placed. His girdle was of gold twist, richly embroidered with pearls, whence hung a scimitar, the scabbard of which flamed with rubies and diamonds. On his head was a bright steel cap, the centre raised to a point, and ending in a large diamond.FAT-H 'ALY SHAH. 363 and round it a blue and white Kashmir shawl was twisted. Fat-h 'Aly Shah also sometimes passed a part of the summer in country palaces which he had built near Tehran. His favourite abode was in the broad vale of Sultaniyah, the eastern extremity of which extends to the horizon. The vast plain is now all pasture, with a winding rivulet flowing through it; but, centuries ago, in the palmy days of Iran, it was covered with corn-fields and gardens, and irrigated by subterranean tunnels, the remains of which are still visible. The snow-covered summits of the Elburz Mountains are visible on the north, and in the centre of the plain are the ruins of the city of Sultaniyah, once the capital of the Mogul sovereigns of Persia. The green dome of the tomb of Khodah Bundah, the Shia'ah Mogul king, rises amidst the ruins, and may be seen at a great distance. 1 Nearer Tehran, at a place called Sulaimaniah, on the Karij Eiver, the Shah had a country place divided into several courts, and containing many handsome apart ments. One room was richly ornamented with painted glass, and contains a portrait of Agha Muhammad sur rounded by the Kajar chiefs. There was a handsome bath, or hamam, in the palace, and a flower garden in the centre of the andarun, or inner court. Fat-h 'Aly had another favourite villa three miles north of Tehran, on one of the slopes of the Elburz 1 The dome is 100 feet in diameter and 120 feet high, covered with green lacquered tiles. The building is of an octagonal form, and had a minaret at each angle, but one only is entire now.364 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. Mountains, called tlie Kasr-i- It was a brick building, enclosing a court which contained chenar- trees and water-tanks. A flight of steps led from the brick terrace in front of the house to a large garden in the plain below. In the centre of the pleasure-ground was an arched octagon, with an inner set of arches resting on twisted columns of a green stone ; and from the summer-house green vistas opened in every direc tion. From the top of it there was a splendid view of the great plain of Tehran, with the city in the centre, the cultivated land towards Kazvin on the right; and generally there might be seen strings of camels on the left wending their way in the far distance towards Khurasan. The Kajar Shah was fond of hunting, and shooting at a mark ; but his favourite business was the amassing and hoarding of money. His avarice was insatiable. Always treating Persia as a conquered country, his only thought was the establishment of his own power, and the extortion of the greatest amount of taxes; his sons, who governed the provinces, followed his exam ple ; and, as a natural consequence, all ranks in Persia had a violent hatred for the Kajar dynasty, whose name was identical with all that is cruel, tyrannical, and unjust. Under such a degrading system the nobles are the mere slaves of a despot, with all the qualities of inso lent menials, cunning, selfish, cowardly, and avaricious. 1 The priesthood, too, lost much of its influence and in dependence of action. The office of Sadru-'s-Sudur, or 1 Eraser's Khurasan,PERSIAN EDUCATION. 365 chief priest of Sufawi times, was abolished by NMir Shah, and the Irndm-i-Jama of Isfahan is now the principal ecclesiastical dignitary of Persia. Of lower rank are the Mujt-ahids, Shaikhs nl-Islam, and Mullahs, who hold the same respective ranks as in the days of 'Abbas the Great. The MMrassehs, or Persian col leges, are entirely in the hands of the clergy, and there are several in every large town. They generally consist of a court, surrounded by buildings containing chambers for students and masters, with a gate on one side ; and frequently a garden and a well in the centre of the court. The students are first taught all points con nected with the faith, the Kuran, and the standard Shia'ah works; the system being for the student to read a few lines, which the doctor then expounds. They also have translations of Aristotle, Euclid, Galen, and some other books; but in astronomy they adopt the system of Ptolemy, which is made subservient to astrology. Avicenna and all the Persian poets are studied, and great care is taken in forming the hand writing. There are three kinds of handwriting in the beautiful Arabic character: the or set hand for writing books; the or court hand; and the Naskh, or running hand. The Persians write with a small reed, and say that to write well a man ought to lean so lightly upon his pen that a fly may beat it out of his hand. Many of the madrassehs have been founded and endowed by kings or pious persons. Next to the nobles, clergy, and soldiery, rank the class of merchants, shopkeepers, and mechanics, who366 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. are less constantly exposed, than others, to tyranny; for the Shah knows well that much of his wealth de pends upon their prosperity. There are many manu factures in the several provinces of Persia. At Shiraz, arms, cutlery, glassware, gold and silver enamelled kaliuns, and wine are made. In TCirm^n and Yezd, shawls, carpets, namads, silk and cotton cloths, loaf-sugar, matchlocks, and earthenware. In IsfaMn, velvets, chintzes, cotton cloths, cutlery, gold brocades, paper, glassware, gold and silver kalians, shoes, arms, and sweetmeats. At Kashan, velvet and silk goods. In Khur4s4n, swords, fire-arms, stoneware, cloths, and sheepskin pelisses. In Mazandaran and Ghilan, silk and woollen goods. Hamadan is famous for its pre pared leather and saddlery; and Kirmanshah for its manufacture of carpets. The most important Persian export is the raw silk of GhlMn, where 900,000 lbs. are annually produced, of which three-tenths are purchased by the Eussians, three-tenths are sent to Baghdad, two-tenths to Con stantinople, and two-tenths to IsfaMn, Yezd, and KasMn—Persian cities which are celebrated for their silk manufactories. 1 Persian grown cotton is chiefly consumed in the country; 2 and the wool, for the most 1 Fraser in 1823.

The farmers and cultivators of the land, in Persia, live under a continual system of extortion and in justice. The Shah extorts from his nobles ; they must procure the sum required from the heads of provinces, they from the KatKhudaked, or heads of villages, and these must squeeze it from the labourers. Every tax, present, fine, or bribe ultimately fall on them. Not withstanding this cruel oppression, most of the peasants can enjoy the comforts of wheaten bread, sour milk, a bit of cheese, and fruit, which is a staple article of food. Their wives and children generally have suffi cient warm clothing, and a few or carpets, in their houses. Their great misery is the utter insecurity of life and property.

Sir Harford Jones relates that the peasants on the road, who had formerly experienced acts of kindness from him, in variably brought him some trifling present when he passed: either a favourite kid, or a cream cheese and fresh butter made by their wives, and they always refused payment. Lady Sheil praises their kindness, attention, and respectful conduct; and Mr. Fraser, who formed a most unfavourable opinion of all Persians, admits that the peasantry, when removed from the malign influence of their rulers, possess independence and honesty. The Ilyats, or wandering tribes, are rude and inde pendent, but formerly supplied the Persian sovereign with a splendid army. The short-sighted policy of the Kajar Shahs has almost destroyed their efficiency. Early in the reign of Fat-h 'Aly Shah, Persia com menced her diplomatic intercourse with European nations, which has continued to the present day. In 1799, Marquis Wellesley, the Governor-General of India, determined to send an embassy to the SMh of Persia, to negotiate a treaty which would have the threefold effect of relieving India from the annual alarm of an Afghan invasion, counteract the designs of the French, and restore a trade which had been in a great degree lost. Major Malcolm was chosen to conduct the mission, and he arrived at Bushire on February 1, 1800, with many valuable presents for the Shah and his nobles. When an or ambassador.MALCOLM'S MISSION. 369 arrives in Persia, it is customary to send a noble to attend upon him, and conduct him to the capital, who is called the Mahmanddr ; and as he approaches each city on his route, a deputation called Istakhal, comes out to meet him. As the greatest importance is attached to the most minute ceremonial details, and as an elchi is respected in proportion to his determination to exact every mark of respect, Malcolm suffered many vexatious deten tions owing to disputes about forms and ceremonies. On November 16, 1800, he was presented to the Sh&amp;h in the diwdn-khdnah of the palace at Tehran. Fat-h 'Aly was one blaze of jewels, and his dress could not have been worth less than a million sterling. The English elchi was received most graciously, his presents were accepted, and old Hajji Ibrahim was appointed to negotiate the treaty. Meanwhile, the dethronement of Zaman Sh&amp;h at Kabul had destroyed the fear of an Afghan invasion ; and a treaty was formed which was mainly directed against the French. Malcolm, who became a great favourite in Persia, left Tehran in February 1801, and returned to India by way of Baghdad. Soon after the departure of Malcolm, that hoary old traitor, Hajji Ibrahim, met with his deserts ; and the ungrateful Shah, who owed his throne to the energy of his minister, was the murderer. Fat-h 'Aly became jealous of his power, and thirsted for his supposed riches. In 1803 his eyes were put out, his tongue was torn from his mouth, and he died from the effects of b B370 HISTORY OF PERSIA. this cruel treatment. His sons and brothers were also put to death. Hajji Ibrahim 1 was a man of great ability, and extraordinary administrative talent, but nothing can wash away his black treason to the chi valrous Lutf 'Aly KMn. He was succeeded, in the post of Prime Minister, by Mirza Shafy, a native of Balfrush in Mazandaran, who received the title of Sadr A'zam. 2 The encroachments of Russia had not ceased on the death of Catherine, in November 1797 ; for though Paul, on his accession, recalled General ZuboiT from beyond the Caucasus, yet, between the years 1802 and 1806, the Russians had annexed the provinces of Mingrelia, Immeritia, Ganja, Karabagh, and Shirvan, besides overrunning the whole of Georgia; and in 1803, General Zizianoff was appointed Governor- General of those Transcaucasian provinces. In 1804, Prince 'Abbas Mirza, who had been declared by Fat-h 'Aly to be his successor, took the field against him, and was entirely defeated near Erivan. In the follow ing spring, however, Zizianoff was assassinated, while besieging the town of B^kA. 3 1 Morier says : ' Hajji Ibrahim was a man of the most humane, beneficent, and noble nature, and his great aim was to temper the violence and cruel disposition of his master (Agha Muhammad), by every counteracting scheme which lay in his power.'— p. 12. 2 Sadr A'zam, means ' First in precedence.' In the time of the Sufawi monarchs the prime minister held the title of Mutamidu- 'd-Daulah, or ' Trusted of the State.' 3 In 1805 a Russian fleet anchored off Lankeran, and assisted Mustafa Khan of Talish in repulsing the Persian troops. The Russians then landed at Enzell, and advanced on Resht, but were defeated by the people of Ghilan.SIR HARFORD JONlv 371 Napoleon, on commencing his famous campaign against Russia in 1807, sent an embassy from Warsaw to Tehran, under General Gardanne. The French envoy was profuse in his promises of aid, brought with him several officers to drill the Persian soldiers, and, for a time, obtained great influence at the court of the Shah. A treaty, offensive and defensive, was signed between Persia and France on May 7, 1807. The British Government, both in London and Cal cutta, became seriously alarmed at the influence of France so near their Indian dominions; and Lord Minto, in 1808, sent Malcolm on a second mission ; but the power of the French at Tehran was so great that he was not permitted to advance beyond Bushire; and he returned unsuccessful to Bombay. On his return he urged Lord Minto to send a military expe dition to the island of Karak; but this was deferred, owing to the mission of Sir Harford Jones from Eng land, who departed from Bushire as soon as Malcolm had left the gulf. Sir Harford Jones, who had resided at el-Basrah from 1784 to 1794, had visited Shiraz when the Zand princes reigned there, and had been political agent at Baghdad from 1798 to 1806 ; was appointed to conduct a mission at the Court of Persia in 1807, and sailed from Portsmouth on board HM.S. ' Sapphire,' in October, with Mr. Willock as an assistant, and Mr. Morier as his private secretary. In December 1808, he left Bushire, and assumed B B 2JL 572 HISTORY OF PEESIA, so bold and dictatorial a tone with the Persians, that all difficulties were soon cleared away. The Peace of Tilsit, too, had been concluded, and the French were no longer able to promise aid against the Eussians, so that General Gardanne was dismissed from Tehran a few days before Sir Harford Jones entered it, in Feb ruary 1809. Mirza Shafy, the Prime Minister, was appointed to negotiate a treaty with him ; and the impetuous conduct of the British Envoy instilled into the minds of the Persian courtiers both astonishment and respect. He arranged that one of the articles should remain indefinite until the decision of the British Government could be announced; but Mirza Shafy insisted on its being made definite, and exclaimed, ' Do you come here to cheat us ? ' The indignant Baronet fired up at once, and said,' You stupid old blockhead, do you dare to use those words to me, who, in this room, represent the King of England ? If it were not for the respect I bear your master, I would knock your brains out, if you have any, against the wall.' He then pushed him with some violence, and, kicking over the candles, rode home with the treaty. In a few hours a number of the minister's servants came to demand it back, when he started up, and said,' I will tell you what it is, my worthy friends, by , if you stay here making a noise and a riot, I will soon make it as much as your heads are worth.' They went away, saying, 'The Farangy is either mad or drunk!' This peculiar, but straightforward, way of nego tiating, proved entirely successful; and a preliminaryMALCOLM'S SECOND MISSION. 373 treaty was soon afterwards signed by Sir Harford Jones and Mirza Shafy, on March 12, 1809. The difficulties of the British Envoy were much increased by the conduct of Lord Minto, then Governor-General of India. Annoyed at the interference of the Home Government in the affairs of Persia, which, in his opinion, belonged exclusively to India; he refused to honour Sir Harford's bills, which caused him great annoyance and embarrassment, wrote despatches in which he found fault with all he had done, and finally sent Sir John Malcolm as a rival Envoy to Tehran. Sir Harford Jones sent Mr. Morier, with the treaty, to England, who was accompanied by Mirza Abdul Hasan, as ambassador from the Shah to George III. ; and, having been superseded by Sir Gore Ouseley, he returned to England himself in 1811. 1 The second mission of Sir John Malcolm was, in a diplomatic point of view, entirely useless, as Sir Har ford Jones already represented the King of England at the court of the SMh. But, in point of usefulness, it was far more important than any mere diplomacy can ever be. To it we owe Sir John Malcolm's in valuable and most interesting 6 History of Persia'; and the vast stores of geographical and historical infor mation collected by the eminent men who composed his suite. He was attended by Christie, who per- 1 Sir Harford Jones, on his return, was treated with neglect by the East India Company ; though he had certainly done good ser vice in Persia.

The latter came with a present of some field-pieces to the Shah, and afterwards distinguished himself by many acts of heroic gallantry in his service. He was a handsome young man, of gigantic stature, who reminded the Persians of their renowned hero, Eustam. 3 Captains Grant and Fotheringham, also accompanied Malcolm, and were sent to Baghdad, to collect information in the countries through which they travelled; while, with the same object, Monteith and Kinneir went to el-Basrah. In March 1810, the two former were attacked by a band of robbers, headed by a chief named Kalb 'Aly, in the mountains of Luristan. Grant was shot dead; and the robber gave Fotheringham his choice between death and the denial of his religion. There could be no doubt of the choice of a brave English officer, and the brutal assassin shot him. 4 1 General Monteith was twenty years serving in the Persian army, and afterwards was with the Russian Marshal Paskeiwitch, in the campaign against the Turks (1828). 2 General Briggs, one of the first Orientalists of the day. 3 Afterwards Sir Henry Bethune, Bart.

Fat-h 'Aly, indeed, was anxious to confer upon him some distinguished honour. He had made General Gardanne a 4 Knight of the Sun,' and proposed thus to decorate Malcolm also ; but the latter refused to wear the same order as a Frenchman. The Shah, therefore, created a new order, called 4 The Sun and Lion,' wherewith to honour Malcolm; and it has since been frequently conferred, by the Shahs of Persia, on distinguished Europeans. The SMh received the field-pieces, and the services of Lindsay and Christie, to assist him in the protracted war with the Eussians; and Malcolm, leaving the camp on July 23, returned to India by Baghdad and el-Basrah. 1 In 1811, Sir Gore Ouseley, accompanied by the Persian ambassador, Abdul Hasan, and Mr. Morier, arrived in Persia, to conclude a definite treaty, which was signed at Tehran on March 14, 1812, by the British Envoy and Mirza Shafy. In the meanwhile, the Eussian war had lingered on. In 1808 the Eussian General Godovitch besieged was a tinge of bigotry, which forcibly reminded him of the infamous Kalb 'Aly, who murdered Captains Grant and Fotheringham.' Eaw- linson had nothing to apprehend, as he was at the head of a Persian regiment. 1 Sir John Malcolm filled several important political posts in India, and eventually became Governor of Bombay. His History of Persia is most ably written, and displays great learning and re search. It is the only complete history of that country in th§ English language. He died in 1833.376 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. Erivan; a most important town, defended by a fort in a position of great natural strength. He blockaded it for six months, but his storming party was repulsed, and he was forced to retreat. In May 1809, Prince Muhammad 'Aly Mirza was ordered to join from the Baghdad frontier. Prince 'Abbas Mirza commanded another division. They both marched towards Erivan. The former, after ravaging the country up to the walls of Tiflis, was repulsed before Gonja, the latter did nothing. The Persian army dispersed as usual, on the approach of winter. In 1810, little or nothing of importance was done. In 1812, the Persian army was disciplined by several British officers, Major D'Arcy, Captain Christie, Major Stone, and Lieutenants Lindsay, Mon- teith, and Willock. Sir Gore Ouseley came to the camp as a mediator between the Persian Prince, Abbas Mirza, and the Eussian Commissioner. He returned, however, unsuccessful to Tehran; and ordered the English officers to withdraw from the Shah's service. Captain Christie, however, and Lind say, the stalwart artillery-man, who was 6 feet 8 inches high without his shoes, with thirteen drill seijeants, resolved to remain. Sir Gore told them—' If gentle men think proper to knock their own heads against a wall, I cannot help it.' The Persian army then advanced to the Araxes, and, on October 31, 1812, were completely surprised by the Russians, and retreated over a little tributary of the Araxes, on their right, with the loss of all their ammunition and camp equipage. The following night the Russians made an attackTREATY OF GULISTAN. 377 on the Persian army at Aslanduz, 1 and entirely routed it. The British officers had in vain advised 'Abb&amp;s Mirza to secure his retreat; and in the night attack Christie fell fighting bravely at the head of his brigade. He had been wounded, and the Eussian villain 2 who commanded, hearing that an English officer was lying wounded on the field, coolly looked at him with his glass, and ordered two of his men to go and kill him. His body was found with five dreadful wounds, four of them with the sabre. Lindsay lost seven of his guns, but saved two. Major Stone, of the Eoyal Artillery, died at Ardebil on November 6, 1812. In the same year the Persians obtained a trifling success by driving the Eussians out of Lankeran, a Caspian seaport in Talish; but in January 1812, it was retaken by a Eussian force of 3,000 men and three vessels of war. This long war had never been carried on with vigour by the Eussians, owing to the attention they were forced to concentrate on the momentous affairs of Europe; and the Persians had failed to gain any permanent success on account of the incapacity of their officers. At length the protracted struggle was 1 Aslanduz means 4 the lion's plain,' so called from a mound erec ted by Timur, on the spot where a lion had been slain. 2 The Russian's name was Kutlerousky, afterwards killed before Lankeran. The Russian version of the story is that Christie was killed because he refused to surrender. 1 Christie was as brave an officer and amiable a man as ever existed. His great bodily strength was combined with perfect mild ness of disposition, while his courage and kindness endeared him to the whole army, both English and Persian.'—Monteith's Kars and Erzeroum, p. 94.378 HISTORY OF PERSIA. brought to a conclusion, through the intervention of Sir Gore Ouseley; and a treaty of peace was signed between Eussia and Persia, at a village in the Kara- bagh, called Gulistan, on October 24, 1813. The Russians were immense gainers, as they succeeded in securing to themselves the provinces of Georgia, Min- grelia, Immeritia, Gonja, Karabagh, Sheki, Shirv&amp;n, and Talish on the Caspian. The Persians were ex cluded from the navigation of the Caspian in ships of war; and an ill-defined boundary to their conquests was left by the Russians, in order that a bone of contention might exist, over which to play the part of the wolf and lamb with their unfortunate neighbour, on the first favourable opportunity. Sir Gore Ouseley does not appear to have acted, on this occasion, with much zeal for the cause of our defeated ally; for the Russian Autocrat was so well pleased with the part he had taken, that he gave him an order (which, however, he was not permitted to wear), and treated him with marked distinction when he passed through St. Petersburg, on his return to England in 1814. The definitive treaty he signed with Persia was informal, and, as it could not be ratified, it was necessary to frame another. 1 Mr. Morier remained in charge of the mission at Tehran. While Sir Gore Ouseley was in Persia, he presented the Shah with a beautifully written copy of the Bible in Persian. In 1811, the Rev. H. Martyn had arrived in Shiraz, 1 Sir Gore Ouseley died in the year 1844.TREATY OF TEHRAN. 379 and, with the assistance of a learned Irani, named Mir Seyyid 'Aly, completed the translation of the whole of the New Testament into Persian; and Fat-h 'Aly SMh is said to have publicly expressed his appro bation of the work. 1 But, though there are a few wild tribes of Nestorians on the western frontier of Azerbaijan, Christianity has never gained ground in Persia; and, unless we except the doubtful story of the conversion of one of the Sassanian and of one or two of the Mongol sovereigns, no Christian has ever reigned over Iran. In 1814, Mr. Ellis, in conjunction with Mr. Morier, was deputed to negotiate a finally definitive Treaty between Great Britain and Persia. Mirza Shafy, the Prime Minister, and another statesman, named Abdu- '1-Wahhab, were appointed to treat on the part of the Shah. The principal articles of this Treaty were that England agreed to supply aid in troops, or a subsidy of 200,000 tomans annually, in case of the invasion of Persia, provided that the SMh was not the aggressor : that if any European power, at peace with England, made war on Persia, England is still bound to assist Persia by troops or by a subsidy: that if the Afghans invaded India, Persia was to send an army against them: and Persian rebels were to be expelled from British territory, and, if they refused to leave it, they were to be seized and sent to Persia. This treaty, usually known as the Treaty of Tehran, 1 While at Shiraz, Mr. Martyn officiated as chaplain to Sir Gore Ouseley's Mission. He died at Tokat in Turkey in 1812.380 HISTORY OF PERSIA. was signed by Mr. Morier and Mr. Ellis on the part of England : and by Mirza Shafy (Prime Minister), 'Abdu- '1-Wahhab (Secretary of State), and Mirza Buzurg (Kaim-Makan), on the part of Persia, on November 25, 1814 ; and continued in force until the war between Persia and England in 1856-7. From this time a British Envoy has always resided at the court of the SMh of Persia; and in July 1815, Captain Willock relieved Mr. Morier as Charge- d'Affaires. 1 The house of the British Mission in Tehran is built in the European style, with a broad flight of steps leading up to a Doric portico between two projecting wings. On the opposite side of the street is the garden belonging to the British Mission. Two double rows of cypresses form a cross, with flower-beds, and a number of fruit-trees on either side. The roses grow to a height of eight or ten feet; and an infant daughter of Sir Gore Ouseley is buried in a small tomb, in a corner of the inclosure. 2 The gardeners are Ghebres, or fire- worshippers. The snowy mountains of Elburz, seen above and between the rows of cypresses, have a most beautiful effect. The Shah bestowed a village on the British and 1 Captain Willock was Attache in Persia in 1809-10; Charge- d'Affaires from July 1815 to January 1827 ; was knighted in 1827, and as Sir Henry Willock became a Director of the East India Com pany in 1838.

Thus Persia commenced a regular diplomatic inter course with European nations ; and, from her position half-way between Eussia and India, obtained an amount of importance, which, under the misgovern- ment of the Kajar Shahs, she would otherwise never have known. ,• I M382 HISTORY OF PERSIA.

After the Treaty of Gulistan—although a Turan, more terrible and unscrupulous than that of Afrasiab, cast a dark and threatening shadow over her northern frontier—Persia enjoyed a period of external peace. But the deplorable misgovernment of the Kajars still continued. One Muhammad Husain Khan, who had begun life as a vendor of provisions at Isfahan, had become A Sadr-A'zam, or Prime Minister ; and retained the favour of the Shah by extracting a considerable revenue from the province of 'Irak, of which he was governor: while 'Abdu-'l-Wahhab, one of the negotiators of the several treaties with England, and the most popular, honest, and talented man in the ShSh's court, was Minister of Foreign Affairs, with the title of Mutamidu- 'd-Daulah. The avaricious old Sh&amp;h continued to devote his attention to the extortion of the greatest possible amount of revenue, and the destruction of the power' KEVENUE OF PERSIA. of all those great chieftains whose followers formerly composed the flower of the Persian army. The revenue of Persia is chiefly derived from the land-tax, which yielded Fat-h 'Aly about 989,000 tomans. The presents at the Nao-Rdz and on other occasions, fines, and confiscations raised it to about 1,500,000 tom&amp;ns more, making a total of 2,489,000 tom&amp;ns, or about 1,500,000/. a year, a very small sum considering the extent and natural riches of the empire, and a striking proof of the misrule of the Kajars. 1 With this income the Shah had to maintain three hundred wives, and their establishments, a large number of courtiers and public servants, and to give away annually a great number of khilaats, or dresses of honour. 2 The expenses of the provincial govern ments and of the army are not included in this estimate of the revenue.

Azerbaijan was given to 'AbMs Mirza, the heir apparent, and Kirmanshah to Prince Muhammad 'Aly Mirza, the Shah's eldest son. 'Abbas Mirza, who was Governor of Azerbaijan for many years, was not the Shah's eldest son, but had been proclaimed Wdly A or ' Heir Apparent,' because his mother was a Kajar Princess. He was a handsome and dignified prince, with large black eyes, and a dark complexion. He appears to have pos sessed enlightened views, and to have been desirous of improving the condition of his country, but was deficient in talent, was rather weak-minded, and loved flattery. 1 He had the advantage of having, in his Minister, a wise councillor as well as a devoted and attached friend. This was Mirza Buzurg, the or governor, who had served in early life under Lutf 'Aly Khan, and always talked of that ill-fated prince with afiectionate esteem. He was son of Mirza Muhammad Husain, the good and amiable Minister 1 Sir Harford Jones, and several other writers, say that 'Abbas Mirza was an excellent, enlightened, and talented prince.

Mirza Buzurg was a man of great ability, and was desirous of the prosperity of his country, while he cherished a wholesome and very natural hatred for the Kussians. 1 Azerbaijan, 2 the province which 'Abbas Mirza and his minister Mirza Buzurg governed, is one of the most important in Persia. It is separated from Armenia, on the north, by the river Araxes, which rises in the mountains twenty miles south of Erzerum. This river is very rapid, but fordable in many places during the summer, and at Nakshawan, it is not more than sixty paces across. A few miles below Megri, which is about fifty-five miles north of Tabriz, a handsome bridge was thrown across the river by Abbas the Great, which is still entire, and the river, forming a junction with the Cyrus, fifty miles from the Caspian, finally empties itself into that sea. On the south, Azerbaijan is separated from 'Mk by the river Kaziluzain, 4 Golden Stream,' which rises a few miles north-west of Sennah in Kurdistan. It flows along the northern frontier of 'Irak ; and uniting with the SMhrud rivulet, the two streams assist each other in forcing a way through the Elburz Mountains, and under the name of Safld Eud, 4 White Eiver,' flow, through Ghilan, to the Caspian Sea.

Its ancient name was Atropatene, from the Satrap Atropates, who, on Alexander's death, declared himself independent. C C386 HISTORY OF PERSIA, the mountains forms a grand and terrific sight, and the roar of the waters, dashing through a ravine with precipices on either side, is heard at a great distance. On the east, Azerbaijan is bounded by Ghilan and Talish, on the west by Armenia and Kurdistan. The province is composed of a succession of undulating eminences, partially cultivated, opening into extensive plains, such as those of Ujain, Tabriz, and Urumiyyah; while, on the south, are the lofty mountains of Lakund, and on the north, the black rocks of Karabagh slope down towards the vast plains of Mogan. The villages of Azerbaijan are embosomed in orchards and gardens, which yield delicious fruits; but, besides the rivers Araxes and Kaziluzain, there is only one considerable stream, the Jaghatu, which, rising in the mountains of Kurdistan, falls into the lake of Urumiyyah. It is two hundred paces wide, and full of fish. The chief towns of Azerbaijan are, Ardebil, Urumiy yah, Khoi, Maraghah, and Tabriz, the capital. Ardebil, on the eastern frontier of the province, is situated in an immense plain, bounded on the west by the snowy peak of Sevellan. The climate is cold, but there are fine meadows and some cultivation in the plain. The most picturesque and flourishing portion of Azerbaijan is around the towns of Urumiyyah and Khoi. The latter, supposed to be on the site of the ancient capital of Armenia—Artaxata, is the chief town of a rich and fertile district, and the emporium of the trade between Persia and Turkey. The walls of the town are in good repair, the bazars excellent, and the streets built with regularity, and shaded with avenues of trees. Urumiyyah, one of the reputed birthplaces ofAZERBAIJAN. 387 Zoroaster, is situated in a plain, fertilized by the river Shar, and the neighbourhood produces corn and wine in abundance. The lake of Urumiyyah is a noble expanse of water (300 miles round), surrounded by picturesque mountains, and fertile valleys filled with villages. The waters, of a dark blue colour, are very salt. On its south-east side, is the town of Maraghah, which is well built, with a spacious bazar, handsome public baths, and high walls. It is famous as the capital of Hulaku Khan. At Urumiyyah, and in the inaccessible fastnesses of the mountains of Kurdistan to the westward, where the Tigris rises, there are numerous tribes of Nes- torian Christians. In 1835, when Colonel Sheil w^as at Urumiyyah, the Bishop paid him a visit, in an enormous red and yellow pair of trousers, an immense red and black turban, and a stout beard. His church, in a village surrounded by beautiful gardens, near Urumiyyah, was a dark room with an altar; and the service consisted in the Bishop chanting alternately with the priest, and reading the Bible. No pictures or images were allowed. Two American missionaries, Dr. Grant and Mr. Perkins, established a flourishing mission at Urumiyyah in 1834 ; which, in 1853, con sisted of thirty-eight American men, women and children. They profess only to teach the Nestorians, not to interfere with their tenets, and were warmly received both by the clergy and people. They have established numerous schools, which are thronged with pupils, and there is also a French mission in the district of Salamas, between Urumiyyah and Khoi. 1: IBf it iii llil; i ; l388 HISTORY OF PERSIA. The patriarch of these Christian tribes lives at Kochanes, near Julamerk, in the heart of the moun tains of Kurdistan, and can muster an army of 15,000 Christian followers. Dr. Grant believes these Christians to be a remnant of the Ten Tribes of Israel, and estimates their number at 200,000 souls. In the district of Urumiyyah they have long been cruelly oppressed by the Afshar tribe, which is settled there, who extort money from them by torture, and often forcibly take their daughters from them, to give them to Muslim husbands. 1 Tabriz, the place where Cyrus deposited the wealth of Croesus, and the favourite residence ofZubaidah, the wife of the Khalifah Harun-er-Eashid, is the capital of Azerbaijan, The city is built in an immense plain, at the foot of a mountain, and on the banks of a small stream which is lost in irrigation. The town is in a ruinous and dilapidated condition, but the chief place of interest is the ark, or ' citadel,' originally built by order of Zubaidah, a noble mass of masonry on a hill outside the walls. Here 'Abbas Mirza established the arsenal and workshops for his army.

The flower of the Persian army is drawn from Azerbaijan ; and the soldiers are naturally active, robust, energetic, and possessed of great powers of enduring cold, ex posure, and fatigue. They are enlisted for life, and by compulsion. But the native officers are usually worth less, cowardly, and promoted by favour and bribery. After the death of Christie, at Aslandu, Major Hart was very successful in drilling the infantry of Azerbaijan, and Lindsay brought the artillery to great perfection. Under the instruction of English artificers, a foundry was established at Tabriz, where guns were cast, gun-carriages built, and musket ammunition prepared, while a powder-mill was constructed outside the town. Abbas Mirza had an army of about 10,600 regular troops, consisting of 9,400 infantry, about 640 artillery, 500 lancers, and 100 men in charge of zamburaks, or small swivels on the backs of camels. Besides these, he could call out about 10,000 irregular Tabriz tufangcMs, or 'matchlock men,' and about 12,000 irregular cavalry from the tribes ; making altogether a force of about 32,000 men. The Sirdar of Erivan, a powerful and nearly independent chief, could also muster, on an emergency, about 1,000 regular troops and 2,000 Kurdish horse. While 'AbMs Mirza was introducing the discipline and drill of European troops into his army, Muhammad AJy Mirza, his formidable rival, and the eldest son of the Shah, ruled over Kirmanshah, and kept up an effective military force. Muhammad 'Aly Mirza was the son of a Georgian390 HISTORY OF PERSIA. slave, and was of a very different cliaracter from his brother. He was haughty and impetuous to a degree, but, at the same time, he was enterprising, gallant, and generous. He had loudly protested against being ex cluded from the succession to the throne. This Prince administered the affairs of Kirmanshah in a truly- paternal way, his charities enriched the town, and the people lived in the enjoyment of plenty. 1 His province was bounded on the west by the Pashalik of Baghdad ; on the south by the mountains of Laristan, inhabited by wild tribes, many of whom belong to a sect believing that 'Aly was God; and on the north by Ardal&amp;n, the eastern division of Kurdistan. The country of the Kurds is wild and inaccessible, and has never been completely subdued. The people are brave, robust, and hardy, but very barbarous; war and rapine are their delight, and murder is hardly considered a crime. The most powerful Kurdish chiefs are the Walls of Sulaimaniyyah and Ardalan. The latter, though he pays a tribute to Persia, is really independent, and governs his people more as a patriarch than a tyrant. His dominions, nominally in Persia, are 200 miles long from the river Sharuh to the Turkish district of Zohab, and 160 miles broad, being separated from the plain of Hamadan by a low range of hills. The Wall of Ardalan claims descent from the great Saladin. His country is composed of clusters of hills, with occasional table lands covered with flocks and the tents of Kurdish tribes, who pass the summer in Ardelan, but remove to the neighbourhood of Baghdad in the winter. These tribes refuse allegiance to both Turkey and Persia ; and 1 Terrier's Caravan Journeys,MUHAMMAD 'ALY MIKZA. 391 as they habitually cross the frontiers and make aggres sions upon their neighbours, they were long the cause of constant quarrels between the two Governments. The villages of Ardalan are built in the glens, and some of the mountains are covered with oak forests. Sennah, the capital, 1 is situated in a deep and well cultivated valley, interspersed with orchards of peach, apple, and cherry trees. The Wali lives in a palace on the summit of a small hill, in the centre of the town. Surrounded by these lawless tribes of Kurds and Feilis, Muhammad 'Aly Mirza was much employed in subduing and keeping in subjection their turbulent chiefs. One of these, named Asa'ad-Khan, disgusted with the way in which his services had been requited by the Shah, retired, in sullen discontent, to his fastnesses not far from Kirmanshah. The Prince marched against him ; and, when near the stronghold, without saying a word to his followers, he rode by himself, straight to the Khan's quarters, and, having announced himself, addressed him on the folly of his conduct in resisting so overwhelming a force. The Khan, struck with the Prince's spirited conduct in thus boldly placing himself entirely in his power, was readily brought to terms : and a desperate rebel was transformed into a brave and attached servant. Muhammad 'Aly Mirza was fond of the sports of the field, chasing the bustard, gazelle, or hare along the valleys and small plains of Kirmanshah. The Persian sportsman is a great trainer of the charhh (the sakar of old writers on falconry), which is famous for courage 1 Seventy-seven miles from Kirmanshah.HISTORY OF PERSIA. and daring. It is usually flown at the bustard or gazelle. The shahin{Falco as well as the European peregrine, or bhairi, were also flown, before the use of fire-arms became general; but are now only found in the SMh's mews. The bdz, or goshawk, remarkable for the beauty of its speckled plumage, is still used by the Persians for catching partridges. The gazelle is chased by both hawks and greyhounds, trained to hunt together. When loosed from the wrist, the hawk flies steadily, and near the ground, towards the gazelle, 1 and darts several times at its head, while the greyhound gains upon the poor frightened animal. The fleetness of the beautiful gazelle is so great that few dogs can overtake it, without this assistance of the hawk. In the year 1821, a war broke out between Persia and Turkey, arising from the insults offered to Persian pilgrims going to Mekkah. Muhammad 'Aly Mirza led his army, consisting chiefly of Kurds who had been disciplined by French officers, 2 to the invasion of the Baghdad Pashalik ; but, just as he was on the point of possessing himself of Baghdad, he was carried off by ch olera. He was a prince of a noble and gene rous disposition, thoroughly Persian and national in his feelings ; and apparently better fitted than his brother and rival to have succeeded to the throne of Persia. Jealous of the successes of his brother, 'Abbas Mirza invaded the Turkish territory with his highly disciplined army, and in 1821 besieged and took Bayazid. The 1 Gazella suhguttarosa. 2 Most of these French officers, on the death of Muhammad 'Aly Mirza, took service in the Panjab, under Run jit Singh.WAR WITH TURKEY. 393 Turkish army advanced to a small fort, called Topra Kala, and drew up in order of battle, with the Pasha of Viin on the right and the Sar'-Askar in the centre. The Persian army was led by the Prince in person, with the Sirdar of Erivan on the right. The savhaz^on 6 infantry ? of Azerbaijan stormed a hillock in front of the Turkish position in gallant style. The Turks fled in confusion, and were pursued by the Persian cavalry; 2,500 of them were killed, and all their camp equi page and baggage fell into the hands of the victors. The cholera, that terrible scourge, which now first appeared in Persia, and which had already carried off Prince Muhammad 'Aly, put a stop to the Turkish war. It broke out with terrible violence in the victorious Persian army, and the Prince retreated in terror and confusion to Khoi, where the troops rapidly began to disperse. The good old Kaim-MaMm, Mirza Buzurg, fell a victim to this terrible scourge at Tabriz, on August 14, 1822. He was succeeded in the office of Minister to Prince 'AbMs Mirza, with the title of Kai'm-Makam, by his son Mirza Abu-'l K^sim, a very different and less worthy man. The long threatened storm from the north was now about to burst over Persia, and Eussia considered the state of affairs to be favourable for another slice of her neighbour's territory. The unsettled boundary question afforded a pretext for constant disputes, and General Yermoloff, the Governor General of Georgia, took every opportunity of exasperating the Persians. In August 1826, Prince Menschikoff was sent on a mission to Tehran, ostensibly to announce the accession of the. i. 394 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Emperor Nicholas, and to settle the disputed boundary, but, judging from his conduct at Constantinople in 1863, he was not very likely to conciliate, and the choice of such a man was an indication of the intentions of Eussia. Believing that war was inevitable, 'Abbas Mirza determined at least to take the initiative, and commenced hostilities in the summer of 1826. It had been determined in 1824 to transfer the superintendence of the British Mission, and the appoint ment of an Envoy, from the Home to the Indian Government; but the new Envoy, Sir John Macdonald, did not arrive at Tehran until December 3, 1826. In the meanwhile the war had broken out with Eussia; and Mr. Willock, only holding his place until relieved by his successor, did not feel justified in offering his mediation. It was the fact of Persia not having asked for it, before declaring war, which afterwards gave the British Government an excuse for evading the engage ments with Persia which were contained in the Morier and Ellis Treaty. 'Abbas Mirza crossed the Araxes, his army occupied Talish, and at first he met with some success; but on September 14, he suffered a signal reverse. With 20,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, 8,000 irregulars, and 24 guns, he had taken up his position near the little river Jam, about four miles from Elizabethpol. Yermoloff, who had by this .time concentrated his forces, advanced against him with 6,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and 12 guns. The Persians were defeated, and in the following November were obliged to retreat across the Araxes.WAR WITH RUSSIA. 395 In the spring of 1827, Yermoloff was superseded by General Paskewitch. In April the Eussians captured Echmiazin, the residence of the Armenian Patriarch, without a blow, and invested the important fortress of 'Abbasabad. 'Abbas Mirza and the Sirdar of Erivan advanced to its relief. Paskewitch crossed the Araxes, by means of hides forming air-bladders, to oppose their progress, and found them posted in a very strong position; but their centre being forced by the Eussians, they broke and fled, leaving 5,000 men on the field. The Prince himself owed his escape entirely to the fleetness of his horse. This was the battle of Jevan-Bulak, fought on July 18, 1827. 'Abbasabad surrendered on the 31st of the same month. 'Abbas Mirza then attempted to retake Echmiazin, and General Krasowsky advancing to its relief, a very bloody battle was fought at 'Abbaran on August 29. On this occasion the Persians fought most gallantly; and, though defeated, they inflicted a very severe loss on their enemies. Two Persian battalions charged two battalions of the Eussian guard, and came off victorious, Krasowsky himself was wounded, and 1,200 Eussians were killed. Paskewitch then ad vanced against the Persians and, having forced 'Abbas Mirza to retreat across the Araxes, he laid siege to Erivan, which important fortress, with immense stores of provisions and ammunition, surrendered on October 13. The Persians were now thoroughly exhausted, their treasure was well nigh spent, and their troops were dispirited. 'Abbas Mirza retreated with the shattered396 HISTORY OF PERSIA, remains of his army to Khoi; and on October 10, the city of Tabriz was surrendered to the Russians, under General Aristoff, by the Asafu-'d-Daulah without a show of resistance. On November 9, the Persian Government submitted to the terms of the conquerors ; and when they de murred to some of their demands, the Eussians at once resumed hostilities, seized upon Ardebil, robbed the shrine of Shah Isma'il of its valuable library, 'and proceeded to overrun the whole of Azerbaijan. Persia was now prostrate before her relentless foe, and hard conditions were unscrupulously wrung from her. The negotiations were carried on at the village of Turkmanchai, between General Paskewitch, 'Abbas Mirza, the Kaim-MaMm and Asafu-'d-Daulah, with the British Envoy, Sir John Macdonald, acting as mediator. The treaty was signed on February 21, 1828. The Khanats or provinces of Erivan, and Nakshawan were ceded to Russia in perpetuity, including Ech- miazin, the abode of the Armenian Patriarch. Persia was forced to pay an indemnity to Russia of nearly 4,000,000^. (fifteen crores of tomans) for the expenses of the war, 1 but the most unjust stipulation was that Persia should not be allowed to have any armed vessel on the Caspian. Thus this sea, which washes the provinces of Persia, equally with those which had been seized upon by Russia, was converted into a Russian lake, although Persia had a peculiar right to defend her 1 Part of this treasure was conveyed to the Russian camp by General Monteith. He says that much of the gold was Indian coin, spoils brought from Delhi by Nadir Shah.TREATY OF TURKMANCHAL coasts from the piratical inroads of the Turkmans. As will be hereafter seen, the Eussians had ulterior views, when they enforced this unjust stipulation. Completely crushed as Persia was by this treaty, she had yet to suffer a more serious disaster in the abrogation of the conditions of the Treaty of Tehran by the British Government. The English offered to give Persia 200,000 tomans towards the payment of the demands of her enemy, on condition that the Shah consented to abrogate the two articles in the Treaty of Tehran containing promises of assistance in case of invasion. In his dire necessity old Pat-h 'Aly was obliged, most unwillingly, to consent to these hard terms. Thus, to save themselves from possible future embarrassment, the Government of England virtually broke their solemn agreement, deserted an old ally in the moment of her deepest misfortune, and very naturally forfeited their former influence at the Court of Tehran. The excuse made by Mr. Canning and his colleagues was that Persia was the aggressor, and that, therefore, the obligation ceased : but the answer to this is given by Sir Justin Sheil, who says that ' the war was pro voked by the domineering attitude of Eussia, and by the aggressive occupation of a portion of Persian territory' 1 The articles were abrogated, for a pecuniary com pensation, on August 25, 1828. The conduct of England on this occasion was as shortsighted and impolitic as it was unjust, for, from 1 Sir Justin Sheil, in Lady Sheil's work. Note D. p. 344.398 HISTORY OF PERSIA. that day our influence has declined in Persia, while the Eussians have occupied the place formerly held by Great Britain, and have steadily advanced their schemes of encroachment and conquest. In December 1828, M. Grebayadoff was sent as Envoy to Tehran, and, assuming a haughty and in solent tone, demanded that all women of the new Eussian territory should be brought before him, to declare whether or no they remained in Persia of their own free will. Among these he demanded the pro duction of two women of Erivan, who resided in the house of a Persian nobleman named 'Aly Yar Khan. They were sent to his house, and declared that they did not wish to leave Tehran, yet he determined to detain them a day or two, to see if they would alter their minds. The mullahs of Tehran were indignant at this conduct of the Eussian Envoy, and, assembling at the principal mosque, declared that their most sacred rights were trampled on, and that if the women were not given up, they should be forcibly dragged from the Eussian's house by the populace. They then ordered their congregations to proceed to the Eussian Embassy, and demand the women. An infuriated mob soon surrounded the house, the roof was torn off, and a fire w T as opened upon the people in the rooms. Others forced their way into the house, every soul was murdered, and M. GrebayadofF himself was killed with a knife-stab on the left side. 1 The brutal mob then 1 M. GrebayadofF was celebrated as a dramatic author in the Eussian language, as well as an ambassador.

Maltzoff, the first secretary, alone escaped: A few feeble attempts had been made by the Shah to quell the disturbance, but his troops finally shut themselves up in the citadel. The old Shah and Prince 'Abbas Mirza were naturally terrified at the resentment of the Eussian Government, when they should hear of this shocking outrage; but, luckily for them, the Emperor Nicholas was just about to engage in a war with Turkey; and a humble embassy, consisting of Khusru Mirza, a young son of Abbas Mirza, accompanied by Mirza Masud (afterwards Minister of Foreign Affairs), and the Amir-i-Nizam, or c Commander-in-Chief,' proceeded to St. Petersburgh, and succeeded in appeasing his just indignation. Deserted by England, Prince 'Abbas Mirza now threw himself into the arms of Eussia. Two regiments, which had been disciplined by British officers, were named after the Eussian Emperor; and, at the instiga tion of Prince Dolgorouki, the Prince in autumn 1830, proceeded to wage war upon his own subjects, and to at Moscow in 1823, has lately been translated by one Benardaky, who announces it as the chef-d?oeuvre of the Russian stage.

A full account of the murder is given in Blackwood 1 s Magazine of September 1830. It was written by the secretary of a Persian, nobleman, and translated by Major Willock. There is another account by De Bode, also from a Persian point of view.400 HISTORY OF PERSIA. reduce those chiefs of Khurasan, who had only held a nominal submission to the Shahs since the time of Nadir. This suicidal proceeding, in weakening the Persian Empire by intestine feuds, exactly suited the policy of Eussia. On June 11, 1830, Sir John Macdonald, the British Envoy died at Tehran; and was succeeded by his assistant, Captain Campbell of the Madras Cavalry, who was not, however, confirmed until two years afterwards, when he was knighted. On the same day Major Hart, who had disciplined the infantry of 'Abbas Mirza's army, also died. In 1829 the cholera, which had first made its appearance in Persia in 1821, again committed fearful ravages, carrying off 200,000 souls in Ghilan alone. It was followed by a famine. In March 1831, 'AbMs Mirza commenced his advance towards Yezd and Kirman, to reduce the Governor, who was in a state of open rebellion, and to restore order. He crossed the desert from Kashan and occupied Yezd on the 25th, Kirman falling into his hands on the 5th of the following month. The town of Yezd is built on a large sandy plain, surrounded by hills ; it produces fruit and some corn, but there is a scarcity of water. It consists of two parts ; the old town well fortified, with a wall, ditch, four gates, an excellent bazar, and about 6,000 houses ; and a straggling new town, outside the walls. The population is about 15,000 souls; and there are considerable manufactures of stuffs, silk being imported from Glulan, and namads. Great numbers of camelsYEZD AND KIRMAN. 401 are also bred there. Yezd is the last resting place of the persecuted GhebresJ or' fire worshippers,' and there were then about 3,000 families in the town, and many more in the surrounding villages. They are an in dustrious and patient race, but subject to heavy taxa tion. The peculiarity of the dress of these people is, that the men invariably wear some shade of yellow, , and the women bright striped silk or cotton trousers. Their manners and customs are very different from those of the Parsis of Bombay, and they bear little or no resemblance in features. The Ghebres are all culti vators. The road from Yezd to Kirman, a distance of 185 miles, passes through the long, barren, and sterile valley included between the great central range of Persia and the more fertile outlying hills. At Kirm&amp;n there is a manufacture of shawls made from the wool of a small white sheep, whose long thick coat fre quently sweeps the ground : but the town was in a ruinous state for many years after the terrible siege of Agha Muhammad in 1794. 2 1 In 1857 the Persian Government demanded 500 tomans from the poor Ghebres of Yezd, as a contribution to the holy war against England. An agent of the Parsis of Bombay interceded for them, and failed. The Parsis then authorised him to pay the sum for their persecuted brethren. A heavy poll tax is imposed on the Ghebres, amounting to 667 tomans annually; and great cruelties are practised on them, when they cannot pay.—See Account of Parsis and Ghebres, at the end of the chapter on the Sassanian dynasty. 2 The present town of Kirman has been gradually rebuilt on the southern part of the former site. It now covers about two-thirds of a square mile, and contains about 35,000 inhabitants, including a small number of Ghebres, and about fifty Hind^ merchants. It is D D ' m I : r I 11 J i I ■ Ui mi- I I'll I402 HISTOEY OF PEESIA. Having reduced these provinces to order, 'Abbas Mirza marched with his army towards KhurMn, taking the road by Isfahan and Kashan to Samnan. He was accompanied by his son Muhammad Mirza, the Kaim-Makam, Colonel Shee who had long been employed in disciplining the troops in Azerbaijan, and some English drill serjeants. He reached Mash-had on January 12, 1832, and commenced a campaign against the turbulent and almost independent chiefs of Khurasan. The large and important province of KhurMn is diversified by plain and upland; and its northern frontier consists of a range of mountains, which con nects the Elburz with the Paropamisan, and forms the rampart wall of the great table-land of Persia. All south of this chain, which, under different names, extends from Azerbaijan to Balkh, is many feet higher than the country to the north. The Paropamisan jo ins the Hindu Kush, and the whole forms, what surrounded by the usual mud rampart, flanked by round towers. The two forts, on rocky hills close to the town, which defended it, and made it an almost impregnable fortress, have never been rebuilt. The town owes its prosperity to the enlightened rule of the present governor and his father, who have ruled the province for fifteen years; paying a net sum to the Shah (200,000 tomans, about 80,000/.), and rendering no account of taxation or expenditure. Although Kirman is the dryest province in Persia, the Wakilu-'l- Mulk (the governor's title), boasted to Major St. John that not a single Kirmani had died of hunger during the famine that desolated Persia from 1870 to 1872. The governor's system is, by making the sale of the wool a government monoply, and retaining the whole export trade of wool to India in his own hands, to realize such an income as to be able to relieve the people of the grinding taxation which prevails elsewhere.KHURASAN. 403 the Arabian geographers call ' the stony girdle of the earth.' KhuriMn was divided into nine petty States, 1 whose chiefs were often at war with each other, and openly defied the government of the Kajar prince at MAsh- had. The towns and districts in the centre of Khurasan, being on the direct road between Tehran and Mash- had, alone remained in the hands of the government, but they suffered terribly from the continual inroads of the Turkmans. The first town in Khurasan, coming from Tehran, is Samn^n (124 miles from Tehran). Close round the walls there is a little cultivation, but the rest of the plain is brown and desolate up to the foot of the mountains, which frown in gloomy grandeur around it. It is a wretched poverty stricken town, with a dilapidated wall. This is the extreme western point of ordinary Turkman incursions. Fifty miles east of Samnan, is the town of Damghsin, which is in a still more ruinous condition than the former; in fact, it is described as a mass of desolate ruins in a vast gravelly plain, with a wretched vaulted 1 Six on the northern frontier, namely— Turbat Haidary, whose chief could muster 1,200 horse Kala'at Nadir „ „ „ „ 500 „ Dere g ez &gt;, „ „ „ 1,000 „ B ^nArd „ „ „ „ 1,000 „ KhaMsMn } ^• ur( ^ s &gt; planted there by 'Abbas the Great Three on the south, namely—Ttirshiz, with 600 horse 1 i , Tabas „ 6,000 „ J ra ' Khazn „ 3,000 „ d d 2404 HISTORY OF PERSIA. lane of mud-built shops for a bazar. The mosque has a minaret of burnt brick, ornamented with filigree work. Thence to Shahrud is thirty-six miles, over a plain containing many villages. This town has a wall flanked with towers, the bazar is good, and there are many gardens and much cultivation in the environs. Shahrud is 210 miles from Tehran, and 240 from Mash-had, and here the road branches off to AstrabM, which is 45 miles to the north-west. A plain, intersected by low hills, and for the most part devoid of water, intervenes its eighty-six long miles between Shahrud and 'Abbasabad. The village of 'Abbasabad consists of a few houses, and a large fortified caravanserai on an eminence. It was founded by 'AbMs the Great, who transported a hundred unfortunate Georgian families to this wretched place. It is in the centre of a barren and wide space, which was often rendered impassable by Turkman inroads and the despotic monarch exiled these poor people to render the road more safe. The whole country- is constantly overrun by Turkmans, and stragglers are often carried off', but they have never yet suc ceeded in surprising the fort, A poor man, in this village, on hearing from Mr. Fraser that England was free from these calamities, exclaimed—' Oh ! take me to that happy land.' Seventy miles further east, through a wilderness abounding in deer and wild asses, is the thriving little town of Sabzawar, the chief town of a district covered with villages and cultivation. The town containsTHE TURKMANS. 405 about 1,200 houses, and a clean and well roofed bazar. Sabzawar is ninety-six miles from Kishapur, the road leading over a plain with villages here and there, and across a chain of hills. NisMpfrr, a very ancient city is situated among gardens and villages, about four miles to the south of a lofty range of mountains. The remains of the kandts, or underground aqueducts, which once rendered the plain so famous for its fertility, are to be seen in every direction. In a mountain glen, thirty miles from Mshapur, are the torquoise mines. The plain of MsMpfrr is eighty miles long by forty broad. After leaving the plain, the road leads over a moun tain range, and in many places it is bordered by willow, ash, and plane trees, which stand out in pleasing relief against the barren precipitous mountains, whose sides are often frequented by agile goats and deer. After ninety-four miles, the city of Mash-had 1 is reached, the capital of lOiurasan. All the villages of this province are walled, to pro tect their inhabitants from the inroads of the Turk mans. These lawless tribes dwell between the eastern shore of the Caspian, and the old ruined town of Merv, and from the borders of Khur&amp;sftn to Khiva. They have for ages dwelt in tents, and wandered with their flocks from one pasture to another. 2 The Turk- 1 For an account of Mash-had, see page 280. 2 Their tents, called khirjahs, are of conical form, the framework being made of wood, and folding up.

They are divided into three principal tribes, namely, the the Guhldns, and the Tekehs. The Yamuts, consisting of 25,000 families, are settled between Khiva and the river Atrak, and at the mouths of the Atrak and Gurgan on the Caspian. They are the least ugly of the Turkman tribes, and are subject to Persia. The Guklans, also subject to Persia, number 12,000 families, and are the most settled and peaceful of the Turkmans. They live between Astrabad and the Atrak, especially on the banks of the river Gurgan. The Tekehs, of 35,000 families, wander between the sources of the Atrak, and the town of Merv (Maru), and extend their excursions to Khiva and Sarakhs. 1 The arms of the Turkmans were a spear ten feet long and a sword. They now have guns. They are excellent horsemen, and pass their lives in pillage and rapine. Their raids into Khurasan are called When a chief determines on making one, a month is given to his followers to get their horses into proper condition. A horse receives one half his usual allow ance until his flesh is much reduced. He is then put at full speed for half an hour every day, and gets little water. After thirty days of this training, the marauders take the field with two horses each, one the over this frame, and the tent may be made very warm, so as to protect its inmates from the severe winters to which the country is subject. 1 Vambery (1864) estimates the total number of Turkman 'tents at 196 ? 500, or (live souls to a tent) 982,500 souls.'ABBlS MlRZA IN KHURASAN. 407 charger, and the other an inferior beast called Yabu, which carries the robber to the Persian frontier, the charger following. The first day's march is usually- only about twelve miles, which is increased each day to sixteen, twenty and twenty-four. The charger is then given 4c\ lbs. of barley flour, 2 of maize flour, and 2 of sheep's tail fat, which puts him into the best possible condition. Spies are sent out, and news being brought the whole party gallop swiftly on their prey, whether caravan or village. In a few minutes all is over, the people carried off into slavery, and the village burnt. The prisoners are tied to the saddle bows of their captors, and treated with horrible cruelty, until they are finally sold in the slave markets of Khiva. The horses of the Turkmans have been known to go over 600 miles in six or even five days. Prince 'Abbas Mirza undertook his campaign in Khurasan, not to put an end to these Turkman atro cities, or to destroy the vile slave markets of Khiva, but to reduce the hereditary nobility of an important Persian province, and to extend the dominion of the Shah to the banks of the Oxus. These were the avowed objects. He commenced by besieging a fortress called Sultan Maidan, between Sabzawar and Nishapur, which was defended by a powerful rebel chief, named Eazha Kuly KMn. After having repulsed an assault very bravely, the besieged surrendered on December 10, 1831. During the spring and summer of 1832, 'AbMs Mirza captured the strongholds of Amir-abad, - ; Mm i [ pi408 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Turshin, Khabushan, Sarakhs, and Turbat Haidary, and forced all the most turbulent chiefs to submit. Khabushan was the stronghold of the Ilkhany of the Kurdish tribes who had been settled in Khurasan by 'Abb^s the Great. After its capture the Ilkhany was deposed, and replaced by his son. Sarakhs was held by the Salur tribe of Turkmans; and when it fell, Abbas Mirza perpetrated a general massacre. The British detachment, under Colonel Shee, then returned to Tabriz, which they reached in March 1833. Since the subjection of Khurasan, the hereditary nobility have given place to the greedy hangers-on of the prince governor at Mash-had, whose rapacious exactions have made the Kajar rule hated everywhere, and the Turk man inroads have become even more frequent than they were before. Having subdued all opposition in Khurasan, Abbas Mirza then proposed to march against the independent Afghan principality of Herat, but Fat-h Aly strongly disapproved of the measure. The old Shah, however, seems to have been overruled, for in 1833, Prince Muhammad Mirza, 'Abbas Mirza's eldest son, led an army to besiege that important place. Herat is rather more than 200 miles from Mash-had, but the road is good, leading through well peopled valleys and plains, with only one important fortress, that of Ghorian, on the road. Muhammad Mirza did not wait to besiege this place, but contenting himself with masking it, he hastened to the siege of Herat. His proceedings, however, were abruptly brought toDEATH OF FAT-H 'ALY SHAH. 409 an end by the news of his father's death, and he retreated to Mash-had, Prince 'Abbas Mirza died at Mash-had on October 21, 1833. He had ruled over Persia, in his father's name, for many years, and had conducted all important negotiations with foreign powers, yet the old Shah outlived him. 'AbMs Mirza was certainly a prince of enlightened views, and desirous of his country's good, but without any extraordinary talent. He gained the respect of the English officers who were for many years in his service, and had several attached and faithful servants, like old Mirza Buzurg, amongst his own countrymen. The old Shah at once proclaimed Muhammad Mirza to be Heir Apparent, with the government of Azer baijan, and the command of the armies, and the K^'im-Makam, who had held the office of minister to his father, since the death of Mirza Blizurg, was retained by Muhammad. But there were many intrigues carried on at court, and it became evident that on the death of the old Shah, which could not be long deferred, there would be several rival competitors for the throne. Muhammad Mirza, therefore, repaired to Tabriz to make preparations for ensuring his own succession. Fat-h 'Aly Shah had now reached the age of 68, and Burnes, who saw him at this time, says that his voice was full and sonorous, and that he still sat erect with much dignity, his splendid beard reaching down far below his waist. The old Shah died, at Isfahan, on410 HISTORY OF PERSIA. October 23, 1834. He was buried at Kum, in a chapel adjoining the shrine of the holy Fatimah. 1 During a long and disastrous reign of 37 years he had lost considerable tracts of important territory, and had misgoverned Persia to such an extent that the Kdjar race had become universally hated. His besetting sin was avarice, yet, at his death, his treasury was nearly empty, and his hoards were torn from him by the Eussians, who wrung money as well as land from the conquered Persians. In private life Fat-h 'Aly would have been loved and respected ; he was neither cruel nor unjust naturally, and possessed many qualities, such as a love for poetry and history, which were well fitted to adorn a private station; but he had no ability for governing, and was entirely deficient in military talent. During the reign of Fat-h 'Aly Shah, the great im portance of the position of Persia was recognised by the European Powers; and from the obscurity of a distant Eastern monarchy, she rose to a place of some consequence among the politicians and diplomatists of the West. But unfortunately this was owing to her position, not to her power; and there can be no hope that, under the rule of the Kajars, Persia will ever regain her ancient glory and prosperity. 1 See page 281.411 CHAPTEE XVII. the peesian gulf and the seyyids of 'omln. The Persian Gulf (Bahr Paris, or Balir-el-'Ajam) is connected witli many of the most charming associations, which have made the East familiar to Europeans. The voyage of Nearchus, the remnant of the fire worship pers, Sindbad the sailor, 1 and many of the other tales in 1 Sulaiman was one of the first Arab (Muhammadan) merchants who embarked on the Persian Gulf, in the beginning of the ninth century. His principal establishment was at el-Basrah, and he visited the various States of India, and all the seas and coasts between el- Basrah and Malacca. His voyages were first translated from Arabic into French by M. Eenaudot, in 1718. Sindbad's voyages took place when the Abbasside Khalifahs were in the height of their power. His first voyage was probably to the coast of Malabar, and the land of the Rajah of Bijnagar. His second to the Malay Peninsula, where camphor is obtained. His third to the Andaman Islands, where he met tattooed and ferocious savages. His fourth to the Malabar coast, where the best pepper is grown, and thence to Malacca. His fifth to some part of Malabar, where it was the custom to use men, instead of horses, as beasts of burden. Hence his story of the 1 Old Man of the Sea.' Thence to the Maldives; thence to the pearl- fisheries of the Gulf of Manar. His sixth, cast on shore near Cape Comorin, and went by the rocky bridge of Rama (he calls it a subterranean passage) to Ceylon. His seventh, sent by Harftn-er-Rashid on an embassy to Ceylon.

Nearchus, the admiral of Alexander's fleet, sailed from the mouth of the Indus with orders to explore the unknown ocean, and if possible to reach Babylon by sea. This famous mariner kept so accurate a log-book, as he coasted along the shores of the Ichthyophagi and of Persia, that the seaman in modern times can, by his descriptions, easily identify every place at which his fleet anchored. 1 There is Cape Monza; and he had heard. The roc has been described by many other travellers; but there is no doubt that such a person as Sindbad existed, and wrote his travels, which were copied into the Arabian Nights (Baron Walckenaer).—See India in the Fifteenth Century, Hakluyt Society, 1857. With reference to the existence of the roc, Professor Owen says that there existed at Madagascar, since the period of the creation of man, though now extinct, an enormous bird, whose egg would hold the contents of 170 chickens' eggs. Doubtless, allowing for Oriental exaggeration, this was the bird referred to by Sindbad. The Moas were a gigantic race of birds, destitute of wings, in New Zealand; a kind of ostrich, called Dinornis Palapteryx, Aptornis, and Notornis by naturalists. The average height of the Dinornis was thirteen feet, and, unlike all other birds, their leg-bones were filled with marrow instead of air. Their eggs were nine inches in diameter and twelve long. Their toes were adapted for uprooting fern roots. In his edition of Marco Polo, Colonel Yule gives the 1 Roc's egg,' measured and drawn from the egg of the JEpyomis, in the British Museum. Marco Polo says that the 1 roc' of Madagas car was so strong that it could seize an elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air. See Yule's Marco Polo, ii. p. 349. 1 Lieut. Kempthorne, I.N., in 1828, traced each anchoring-place of the Grecian admiral, and wrote a most interesting account of these shores.NEARCIIUS. 413 Sonmeani; the sandy shores of Hormarah, the desolate Isle of Ashtola, abounding in turtle; the bay of Gw&amp;rdel, which he calls Mosarna, and describes with accuracy; and Charbar, the barren waste of sand surrounding a large bay. The whole of this coast from Charbar to the Indus was inhabited then, as now, by poor tribes of Baluchis whom Nearchus called Ichthyophagi, both men and cattle living entirely on fish. Then the Grecian admiral sighted Cape Musandim, and entered the Persian Gulf. Nearchus next came to Neoptana, where then, as now, the fisher men used canoes made of several small planks sewn together with cords made of the bark of the date- tree. At Anamis, now Minav, he received tidings of Alexander's army, and personally reported the safety of his fleet. He was ordered to complete his wonderful voyage; and accordingly having touched at Organa, the modern Ormuz ; Oaracta, now the Isle of el-Kishm, the small Isle of Hanjam, the Islet of the Great Tanb, Mogu, Halilah, and Gogana, now the town of Kankan, he at length arrived safely in the river Tigris, 325 B.C. Alexander himself, also descended the Eulceus, and Pasatigris (Mrun), and sailed up the Tigris to the camp of Hephoestion. 1 The Persians, excepting the fishermen of the Caspian, never became sailors: they have ever had an insuperable dislike and dread of the sea, and their shores have always been peopled by the tribes of Arabian origin, who were sometimes merchants but 1 See Table on following page.ORMUZ. 415 punished these sea robbers, 1 is said to have traded with India; and one of the Ata-begs of Ears conquered the Islands in the Persian Gulf; but generally the natives of Iran have remained true to the saying of one of the greatest of their poets— Upon the sea 'tis true there's boundless gain, Would'st thou be safe, upon the shore remain. When, however, a remnant of the Fire Worshippers of Iriln fled to the Isle of Ormuz, from the fury of their Arab conquerors, they were forced, by reason of the imminence of their danger, to embark on the dreaded element. They escaped to India; and the Parsis, as upright merchants and shipbuilders, have since become the most respected portion of the native population of Bombay. 2 When the Arabs, in the eighth century, overran Mesopotamia and Persia, they at once took to the sea ; and, perceiving the immense commercial importance of the Persian Gulf, they built the town of el-Basrah near the mouth of the Tigris, as a seaport of Baghd&amp;d, the Khalifah's capital. The Arabs not only carried on a considerable trade with the ports of India, their voyages also extended to the Islands of the Indian Archipelago, and to Canton. A regular commerce was opened, in the ninth century, between China and the Persian Gulf, and the Arabian mariners speak of the silk, the porcelain, and the tea of the Celestial Empire. The whole trade of the Persian Gulf remained in the hands of the Arabs for many 1 See page 75. 2 See page 98.416 THE PERSIAN GULF. centuries, and a long line of merchant-kings reigned at Ormuz, before Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope. From that time, until the middle of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese were paramount in that inland sea. The great Albuquerque seized upon Ormuz and Maskat, and several forts and factories were established by the Portuguese along the shores and islands of the gulf. ' Ormuz,' says Eobertson, ' became in the hands of the Portuguese the great mart from which Persia was supplied with Indian things ; and a city they built on this barren island, without water, became one of the greatest seats in the East for splendour and luxury. 1 The entrance to the Persian Gulf is formed, on one side, by the long promontory of Eas Musandim, with two isolated rocks called the Quoins, at a short distance from the land, and on the other by the Isle of Ormuz, 2 a few miles from the Persian shore. Ormuz is twelve miles round, and appears broken and rugged from the sea. The hills are in many places covered with an incrustation of salt, which is exported in great quantities. Here there was once a city of 40,000 inhabitants, whither merchants from every quarter of the globe resorted. Now a few ruins scattered amidst wild deserts of salt alone testify to its former greatness. Opposite Ormuz the river Minav enters the Persian Gulf, which, at high tide, is navigable for vessels of 1 Under the Portuguese rule, the descendants of the old Arab kings of Ormuz were permitted to retain their titles and some vestiges of former splendour, and a ceremony was performed on their accession. 2 Properly Hormftz.EL-KISHM. 417 20 tons up to the town of Shah Bandar, about 14 miles. One mile from the town is the fort of Minav, a square with round towers at the angles, and some old Portuguese guns. From Shah Bandar a fertile plain extends to HajjiabM. Sheep and goats are numerous, and the land is covered with crops of wheat, and orchards of cherries and apples. A few miles west of the mouth of the Minav is the town of Gombrun or Bandar 'Abbas, which rose to importance on the fall of Ormuz. The town is built on a slope close to the sea, there are few good houses, and the natives are mostly lodged in huts. The old English factory is now in ruins, but the Dutch building is still in tolerable repair, and served as a residence for the Seyyid of Maskat, when the town was occupied by that prince. The European tombs are just outside the walls. Between Bandar 'Abbas and Linjah there is little to attract attention on the Persian shore. The mountains gradually approach the sea, and at Linjah they are only three miles off. The maritime plain is low and barren, with a few cultivated spots at intervals. Opposite the island of Laft there are some mangrove thickets, and close to the sea is the village of Khamir, near the famous sulphur mines formerly rented by the SuMn of Maskat. Between Khamir and Linjah are the towns of Bandar-Mu'allim, and Kunk, where the Portuguese had a factory. The island of el-Kishm (three miles south of Gombrun) is about thirteen miles from the Persian B E ■ 1111 : ! 1:|i fl ilM i : ' ! r Mi 'ill II Si 11418 THE PERSIAN GULF. shore, and resembles a fish in shape: the town of el- Kishm at its head, Laft and the isle of Hanjam to the north and south of either fin, and Basidu at the ex tremity of the tail. el-Kishm is fifty-four miles long by twenty broad. The northern part is the most fertile, yielding barley, melons, dates in large quantities, and grapes from which a white wine is made. There are about 5,000 inhabitants in the villages along the coast. The town of el-Kishm, neur the sea at the eastern point of the land, is walled, and the houses have flat roofs. There are date trees, and a few patches of cultivation near the town, the population of which is 2,000. The other towns on the island are Laft and Basidu. The plains abound in small and very beautiful antelopes, which are chased with greyhounds ; goats are also bred in great numbers, and partridges and rock pigeons are plentiful, but the island is infested by jackals. Twenty-five miles from the western extreme of el-Kishm are two rocks, called the Great and Little Tombs, or more correctly The great Tanb is a low flat islet, about four miles round, abounding in antelopes, which were often coursed with greyhounds by the British officers from Basidu. The channel be tween el-Kishm and the mainland is very intricate, with numerous small islets covered with verdure. At the upper part of the Persian Gulf is the bay of Halilah, having many villages on its shore, with a lofty hill , about thirty miles off, where snow may be had: and a little further on is the town of Bushire, at the end of a peninsula; consisting of about 600 houses, 400 huts, and two mosques. From the sea the wind-THE PEARL FISHERY. 419 towers on the tops of the houses have a pretty effect. The British Eesidency is near the beach, at the south extreme of the town. From Bushire to the Shattu-VArab, the shores of the Persian Gulf are inhabited by the powerful Cha'ab (or Ka'ab) tribe of Arabs. On the Arabian side of the gulf is the large island of el-Bahrain, and the extensive banks of pearl oysters. The deep diving, at the pearl fisheries of el-Bahrain, does not commence until the hot months of July and August. The water on the Bahrain banks is about seven fathoms deep. The divers have their ears stuffed with bees'-wax, their nostrils com pressed with a piece of horn, and a net round their wastes to contain the oysters. They hold on to a rope attached to the boat in their descent, and one minute is rather above their average time under water; though, in good weather, a diver will descend from twelve to fifteen times a day. The annual amount produced at the pearl fishery of el-Bahrain is about 200,000/. and about half as much more at the other fisheries of Eas el- Khaimah, Abu-Zhaby, and esh-SMrikah, making a total of 300,000/. There are about 1,500 pearl fishing boats at el-Bahrain, and the trade is in the hands of mer chants : much seed pearl is used, throughout Asia, in the composition of majuns, a sort of intoxicating sweetmeat. The Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf are barren and desolate, the wild tribes living on dates, salt fish, and a little rice. Eas Musandim, the Arabian point at the entrance of the gulf, is the outer part of an island separated from the main by a deep and narrow channel. The point itself is 200 feet high, rising abruptly from E E ; IfHl Si 1 •; III hi 1 V n Iffl IJ ri420 THE PERSIAN GULF. the sea, and composed of basalt. Its aspect is black and gloomy. On both sides of the cape, the coast is indented by deep coves, where the transparent blue sea penetrates far into the land, with lofty cliffs on either side. Here the rock fish may be seen sporting amidst the coral, in ten fathoms depth close to the shore, and occasionally a huge sun fish (fourteen feet across the back, nine feet long, with a mouth six feet wide, and a tail four feet long), will flounder to the surface. In these coves the basalt hills, rugged and barren, rise abruptly from the sea to a height of 200 to 800 feet; and the water makes a deep roar as it washes into the vast caves at their base. At the extreme ends of the inlets there are little sandy bays, where a poor and ignorant race of Arabs live in small stone huts, sur rounded by a few date palms, and feed on dates and salt fish. After the fall of the Portuguese, the English and Dutch, with their factories at Gombrun, shared the trade of the Persian Gulf. During the anarchy which followed the fall of the Sufawi dynasty the Europeans retired from Gombrun ; but under the enlightened rule of the good Wakll Karim-KMn their trade was again restored. The Dutch occupied the island of Karak for several years ; and the English established themselves at Bushire, to be near Karim's capital at Shiraz. On July 2, 1763, the Wakil signed a treaty with A. Price, Esq., by which the English were permitted to build a factory at Bush ire, and in any other part of the king dom. No duty was to be charged on their goods; they were to have the exclusive right of importingmiAN. 421 cloth; to enjoy the free exercise of their religion without molestation; to have a burial ground and a garden; and to receive back the house which had formerly belonged to them at Shiraz. 1 A powerful maritime Arab power also arose, on the fall of the Portuguese; and the Sovereign of 'Oman, better but incorrectly known as the Imam of Maskat, has long been the most important naval prince, not only in Arabia, but in Asia. 'Oman is a narrow strip of land, never exceeding 150 miles in width, extending from the island of Masirah to Cape Musandim. A range of mountains traverses the wdiole extent and, in latitude 23° N. the Jebel-Akhdhar, another range of much greater height, branches from them at right angles. The coast is barren and desolate; and the interior, beyond the mountains, may be described as an arid desert plain, studded with oases. 2 Inland 'Oman is bounded by the trackless desert of the interior of Arabia. The oases 1 After the establishment of a factory at Bushire, one vessel used to be sent there annually by the East India Company, with a cargo of sixty to one hundred bales of Masulipatam chintz, iron, sugar, Bengal muslins, and coarse Surat goods, consisting chiefly of blue checked veils for the women. From 1784 the trade between Bushire and India rapidly increased, in spite of the wars between the Zands and Kajars, and in 1809 the annual importation of chintzes alone, at Bushire, had risen to 600 bales. Bushire, in 1828, was governed by a Shaikh named 'Abdu-'r-Rasiil, a despotic tyrant, and guilty of every kind of excess and cruelty towards his subjects. The inhabitants trembled at his approach ; but in 1832 he was assassinated in the desert, whilst returning from Shiraz, where he had been staying during the virulence of the plague. His son then took the reins of government. 2 Lieut. Wellsted, I.N., Journey into 'Oman in 1837.422 THE PEESTAN GULF. of 'Oman are very fertile. At el-Bediyyah there are seven, clustered together, and watered by subterranean rivulets. There are plenty of almond, fig, and date trees, and the oranges and limes are thickly covered with fruit. Ibra, twenty-two miles from el-Bediyyah, is another oasis containing a town, with houses having windows and doorways surmounted by Saracenic arches, doors cased with brass, and parapets round the roofs. Another oasis is Minna (or Manh), covered with lofty almond trees, citron and orange trees, emitting a delicious fragrance. Fields of corn and sugar-cane stretch away for miles, intersected by streams of water, and the people are contented and happy. Nezwa is the largest and most populous oasis. The range of the Jebel-Akhdhar Mountains, running about thirty miles from east to west, is intersected by deep and narrow valleys, which have plenty of fresh water springs, abundance of fruit, and are inhabited by an independent and brave race of Arab mountaineers. On the sea coast the chief ports are Barkah, which is large and well built, and Maskat, the maritime capital of 'Oman. In a small cove, protected by an island, and a ridge of mountains on its north-west side, is the city of Miskat, built on a sandy beach, at the gorge of a pass into the interior. On an eminence, on the north west side, there is a fort mounted with guns, and batteries and watch-towers are dotted over the moun tains and crags around. The town is crowded with tall houses in narrow and heated lanes or bazars, and domes and minarets rise above the flat roofs.'oman. 423 The Sultanas palace is a very good stone building, close to the sea, with rooms opening into a small court. The city has a few deep wells round it, some clusters of date palms, plenty of fruit, and abundance of excellent fish. The Imam resided chiefly at Barkah, on the sea coast, about sixty miles to the eastward. The beach of Maskat is covered with packages of dates blackened with flies, and scented with salt fish. The heat is intense in summer, as the town is shut out by hills from every breeze, and there is scarcely a breath of air. 'Oman was governed, under the Khalifahs, by a Waly; but in 751 a.d . the people elected a sovereign of their own, named Julanda-bin-Mas ud, who is styled the first of the rightful Imams of 'Oman. The word Imdm is from an Arabic root signifying ' to follow after,' and Imam thus means, one whose example ought to be followed. When 'Aly consented to submit his dispute with Mu'awiyah to arbitration, 12,000 true believers took offence and revolted. They were called Khawdrij; and affirmed that a man might become Imam though not of the tribe of Kuraish, provided he were just and pious. The original Khawarij were defeated by 'Aly in 658 a.d ., but they were not ex tinguished ; and in 750 the head of their sect in 'Oman was Abdallah-bin-Ibadh, whose followers are still called, after him, Ibadiyyah. They elected their Imams for their personal merit or popularity, irrespective of family descent, for nearly 900 years, reckoning from Julanda-bin-Mas'ud to the accession of Nasir-bin- Murshid in 1624 a.d . After that time, the best man of the ruling family was generally elected.424 THE PERSIAN GULF, The warlike Imams drove the Portuguese out of Maskat in about 1652, putting the whole garrison to the sword, except a few who became converts to Islam. From that time the Imam of Maskat became the paramount native power in the Persian Gulf. In 1697 he conquered extensive dominions from the Portuguese on the east coast of Africa, which are held by the Arabs to this day. They consist of several towns on islands close to the shore, the chief of which are Zanzibar, Pemba, Mombasa, and Lamu. The two chief tribes of 'Oman were called the Hinawy and Ghafiry, and the Imamship remained in the power of the latter until 1738. In the beginning of the seventeenth century, Malik- bin-Abi-'l-'Arab, being ruler of 'Oman, with his capital at er-Eastak, seventy learned Muslims chose for their Imam Nasir-bin-Murshid, which office he accepted in 1618 A.D. Nasir-bin-Murshid reigned until A.D. 1644; and on his death the learned Muslims of 'Oman conferred the office on his cousin, Sultan-bin-Seif. From his time there were constant disputed successions. The office, however, always remained in the same family. In 1724 the succession was disputed between Seif-bin- Sultan and Bela'rab-bin-Sultan, and the former called in the aid of the Persians, which alienated the affections of the people, and the Imamship was conferred on his uncle Sultan-bin-Murshid. On the death of SuMn-bin-Murshid, at the siege of Sohar in 1738, Ahmed-bin-Sa'id, the most renowned warrior of 'Oman at that time, of the tribe of the'OM I N . 425 Hin&amp;wy, was declared Imam by the people, and founded the present dynasty. 1 Ahmed-bin-Sa'id enjoyed the dignity of Imam for forty years; when he was succeeded, in 1775, by his son Sa'id, who was deposed by his son Hamed. Hamed died in 1792; and his uncle SuMn suc ceeded, who only retained the title of Seyyid. The rulers of 'Om&amp;n have never since assumed the title of ' IiMm,' In 1784 the 'Uttubi Arabs, who had long been great traders at Grain (or el-Kuweit) near el-Basrah, seized upon the island of el-Bahrain and the pearl fisheries. The Shaikhs of Bushire made several attempts to dis lodge them, but failed. At length they refused to pay the customary tribute of -g per cent, which had always been taken by the Seyyid of Maskat from all native boats trading from the Persian Gulf to India or Africa. In 1800, therefore, the Seyyid SuMn attacked them, seized el-Bahrain, and gave the government of it to his son the Seyyid Salim, then only twelve years old; but the 'Uttubis retook it, and remained on it for seven years. It was at about this time that the East India Com pany first entered into political relations with the ruler of 'Omln, the first treaty being dated August 12,1798. The Seyyid SuMn rented el-Kishm, Hormuz, Bandar 1 Zanzibar Commission, liev. G. P. Badger, from the 'Oman, 1858.

In January 1800, Sultan concluded a second treaty with Sir John Malcolm, by which it was arranged that a British Agent should reside at Maskat. In 1803, as Sultan was going with his fleet from el-Kishm to Khamir, the ships were becalmed, and he went on in an open boat. He was attacked and murdered by five pirate vessels, within sight of his own fleet. The Seyyid SuMn left three sons, namely, Salim, Sa'id, and Hamed. The government, thereafter, was administered conjointly by the two brothers Salim and Sa'id until the death of the former in 1821. The pirates who murdered SuMn belong to those Arab tribes which inhabit the shores of the Persian Gulf, and are called el-Juwasimi or el-Kuwasimi. They are excellent sailors, brave and independent, but incorrigible pirates. There is a tradition con cerning their origin, which relates that a fisherman once found his net very heavy, and hauling it up with great difficulty a hairy monster appeared, which kept crying i Hold! haul I ' The creature proved docile and intelligent, and was put to guard his flocks. Having gallantly driven off some Persian robbers, it was re warded with the daughter of the fisherman, and became the ancestor of the el-Juwasimi. 1 Early in the present century, the el-Juwasimi tribes joined the Wahhabis, and thus added zeal and fanati cism to their desperate courage. The sect of Wahhabis was founded by one Muham- 1 Malcolm's Sketches in Persia,THE WAHHlBIS. 427 mad-bm-'Abdu-'l-Wahliab, of the Benu-Temlm tribe. In about the year 1730 he left the Nejd, or central part of Arabia, to study theology in the colleges of Baghdad and Mosul. Disgusted with the luxury and tyranny of the Turks, which ill accorded with the simplicity enjoined by the Arabian Prophet, and denying the right of the Turkish Sultan to the title of Imam, he retired to ed-Dir'iyyah, the capital of Nejd, to preach his reformed doctrine. The chief of ed-Dir'iyyah, Muhammad-bin-Su'ud, became his first convert, and his father-in-law ; and very soon his disciples included the Arabian tribes between Hillah on the Euphrates and ed-Dir'iyyah, and between Grain and Arabia Felix. The WahMbis were the Puritans of Arabia, and Muhammad-bin-Su'ud assumed the character both of a temporal and spiritual leader. Most of the lawless tribes on the Persian Gulf embraced his tenets. The chief of ed-Dir'iyyah, in 1798, sent a Wahhabi envoy to the Pasha of Baghdad. Entering the splen did palace in the simplest Arab dress, he said : ' Let the ratification of the agreement be done soon, and the curse of God be on him who acts treacherously. If you seek instruction, the Wahhabi chief will afford it.' He then rose up and departed, to the utter astonishment and confusion of the Pasha. 'Abdu-'l-Aziz, son of the former chief, had now assumed the lead of the Wahhabis, and between 1798 and 1806 they acquired a great increase of power. After a war with the Sharif of Mekkah, they captured et-Taif, the summer residence of the people of Mekkah ; and in 1803 they besieged the holy city428 THE PERSIAN GULF. itself, which was bravely defended by Sherif Shaikh Glialib. Mekkah, however, was forced to submit to the conquering Wahhabis; and in 1804 el-Medinah, the whole of the Ilijaz, and Yemen were conquered by the reformers. In 1803 'Abdu-'l-Aziz was assassinated, and his son Su'ud II. succeeded him in command of the WahMbis, with his capital at ed-Dir'iyyah. The fierce and savage race of cl-Jawasimi pirates of the Persian Gulf, who had embraced the Wahhabi tenets, became more desperate and audacious than ever. In 1807 they seized el-Bahrain, and drove out the 'Omani troops. They also had strongholds at Laft, on the isle of el-Kishm, and in other places, but their chief fortress was at Eas-el-Khaimah, on the Arabian coast, near Cape Musandim. The pirates in large boats at tacked every merchant-man they met, and murdered every soul—showing no undue partiality for creed or nation. On one occasion they had the audacity to make an attack upon H.M.S. ' Lion' (50), but were beaten off; and in 1808 three pirate boats came alongside H.M.S. ' Nereid,' Captain Corbett, mistaking her for a merchant vessel. Two were sunk, and the third was run down, not one of the pirates escaping. Soon afterwards a large English ship, the 'Minerva,' was seized and every soul on board put to the sword. The raids of these piratical Wahhabis, however, were not confined to the gulf, and the islands of Kuria-Muria and Socotra suffered from their ruthless attacks. At length their ravages became unbearable, as itTHE WAHHABIS. 429 was impossible for any peaceful trader to enter the Gulf, and it became necessary to take some steps to put an end to their atrocities. Accordingly, the British Government at Bombay, in league with the Seyyid Sa'id of'Oman, in 1810, sent Colonel Smith (afterwards Sir Lionel Smith) with a land force and the 6 Chifonne' frigate. Captain Wainwright, to root them out of their strongholds. The expedition first destroyed Eas-el- Khaimah, and many piratical vessels, and finally attacked the el-Juwasimi fort of Shinas, aided by 4,000 of the 'Oman troops, in December 1809. The fort was bombarded, and in January 1810, the troops landed on a sandy beach with two field-pieces. The fort was taken by storm after a most gallant and desperate resistance. In February the expedition re turned to Bombay, and the acts of piracy were imme diately renewed in all parts of the Gulf, accompanied by the usual atrocious murders. But the Wahhabis on shore had already met with a more ruthless enemy. The famous Muhammad-'Aly, who became Pasha of Egypt in 1804, commenced hostihties against them in 1809. Collecting a large fleet of boats at Suez, his son Tusun-Bey landed an army at Tembo, and in 1814 el-Medinah and Mekkah were in the hands of the Egyptian P&amp;sha. In 1814 Su'ud, Prince of the WahhAbis, died, and was succeeded by his son 'Abdallah. In January 1815, the WahMbis were entirely defeated by Muhammad-'Aly, 5,000 heads were laid at the Pasha's feet, and the rest fled ; but the 'Aseir Arabs tied each other by the leg to prevent a single430 THE PERSIAN GULF. one of their number from taking to flight, and they all fell fighting side by side, Muhammad-'Aly offered quarter to 300 Wahhabis, who accepted it; but the old ruffian impaled fifty before the gates of Mekkah, and the rest were tortured to death in front of the gate of Juddah. This battle was fought at Basal, between Kulakh and et-Taif. In 1816 Ibrahim Pasha took the field against the WahMbis; and in 1818, after a long siege, he captured ed-Dir'iyyah, their capital, and sent their chief 'Abdallah in chains to Constantinople, where he was barbarously put to death. But the depredations of the Wahhabi pirates did not cease with the fall of ed-Dir'iyyah, and at length it became necessary to send another English expedition against them. A small squadron under Captain Collier, and a force of 3,000 men commanded by General Sir William Grant, sailed from India in November 1819, and besieged the piratical stronghold of Bas-el-Khaimah. The Arabs displayed extraordinary bravery and military skill both at sea and on shore; but the place was captured by the English, 200 boats were burnt, and many Indians were released from slavery. A garrison of native troops was left there, which was afterwards removed to el-Kishm. The hill fort of Zyah, defended by a veteran Wahhabi, was also captured after a gallant defence. A detachment, aided by the ruler of 'Oman, was then sent against the Benu-bu-'Aly, who dwelt under Eas-el-Hadd, and were accused of piracy. Captain Thomson landed at Sur, and marched against them, inBEITISH POLICY IN THE PEESIAN GULF. 431 November 1820; but a sudden and overwhelming attack was made upon him, and his detachment was totally destroyed, seven officers and 303 men being left dead on the sandy plain. In January 1821 Sir Lionel Smith, with 1,282 European and 1,718 native troops 5 sailed from Bombay to avenge this disaster. They landed at Sur, and the same night the Benu-bu-'Aly vigorously attacked their camp, and were repulsed with much difficulty. As soon as the English came in sight of their town, the Arabs boldly attacked them with swords, dashing on unchecked by a rolling fire of musketry. At last they retired in good order, and the old Shaikh surrendered, after having displayed great gallantry, and proved himself an enemy worthy to cope even with British valour. In 1837 Lieutenant Wellsted, I. N., visited the Benu-bu-'Aly tribe. He went boldly to the Shaikh's tent, and proclaimed himself to be an Englishman. The whole tribe immediately received him most cordi ally, delighted at his confidence in thus throwing him self amongst them. c We have fought,' said these gallant children of the desert, ( and we should now be friends.' After the destruction of the pirates, it became necessary for the English to maintain a naval force in the Persian Gulf; and the influence of England was exercised:—1st, to suppress piracy and to extend commerce ; 2nd, to maintain the status quo of the chiefs on the shores of the Gulf; 3rd, to prevent war and aggression on the sea; 4th, to exclude all foreign432 THE PERSIAN GULF. intluences; and 5th, to suppress the slave trade and slavery. Basidu, on the island of el-Kishm, was fixed upon as our naval head-quarters, A guard ship was established there, and a hospital, racket-court, billiard- room, and bazar were erected on shore. A sandy- region, without half a blade of grass, surrounds the place on every side : there is an intense glare from the sand, and the heat in summer is excessive. The naval force was placed under the orders of the British Eesident at Bushire. The occupation of el-Kishm had been sanctioned by the ruler of Maskat; but, early in 1821, the Bersian Government made complaints, and asserted their claims to it. It appeared that the Arabs of Kunk, a Bersian port, had occupied the island in 1740, and rented it from Nadir-Shah, but that the Seyyid Sultan had driven them out in 1792, and had since continued to hold el-Kishm, Bandar 'Abbas, Hormuz, and Khamlr. The British Government at Bombay sent Dr. Andrew Jukes, in 1822, to make explanations to the Shah of Bersia, and to represent our motives of action in the Gulf, but he died on his way, of the plague, at Isfahan. The rulers of 'Oman have always been the firm and faithful allies of England, but their naval power has de clined of late years. In 1820, the Seyyid Sa'id had five fine ships, two of which were frigates, the ' Shah 'Alam of fifty and the ' Caroline ' of forty guns, besides several buggalows. The carrying trade of the Seyyid and his subjects was very extensive, and his income greatly exceeded his expenditure. His revenue consisted of a tithe of the produce of 'Oman, chiefly dates, | per cent.THE SEYYIDS OF MASKAT. 433 on produce passing up the Gulf in Arab bottoms, revenue of land at Khamir and Minav in Persia, and of sulphur mines at Khamir, and the salt of Hormuz : also the duties at Bandar 'Abbas, Zanzibar, and the Seyyid's other African possessions. In 1837, the imports at Maskat, consisting chiefly of cloth and corn, were valued at 3,300,000^ a year. The exports are dates, madder, salt fish, and sharks' fins to China (for soup). The population was about GOjOOO. 1 Sa'id, the Seyyid of Maskat and 'Oman, was tolerant, just, and generous, and the merchants of every nation were protected in his dominions. His revenue was about 80,000/. a year, 20,000/. of which was derived from the slave trade, and 40,000 slaves used to be sold yearly at Zanzibar; yet, in August 1822, he signed a treaty with Captain Moresby of H.M.S. ^Menai,' by which the slave trade was abolished throughout his dominions. The Seyyid Sa'id's favourite residence was at Zanzibar, but he visited Maskat every two or three years, until 1840, when Zanzibar became his permanent place of residence. At length, after a very long reign, during which he had maintained his friendship with England unbroken, although, when attacked by the WahMbis in 1832, we left him to his fate, he died in 1856. He was succeeded by his son the Seyyid Thu- wainy at Maskat, and by the Seyyid Majid at Zanzibar. 2 1 The trade of Zanzibar in 1859 was valued at 1,664,577Z. 2 In a letter to Lord Aberdeen in 1844, the Seyyid Sa'id said that he constituted his son KMlid to succeed him in Africa, and the Seyyid Thuwainy in 'Oman. Khalid died in 1854, and in 1856 he appointed the Seyyid Majid to succeed him in Africa. Disputes arose between the rulers of M askat and Zanzibar, which F F i I i I434 THE PERSIAN GULF.

The Persian Gulf is destined to become a route of the greatest importance, when the Euphrates Valley Eailroad is completed, and the shortest route to India is finally adopted. Many of the most important events in the world's history have taken place on the shores of the river Euphrates, or on its sister stream the Tigris. Here stood the capitals of mighty empires, which rose up one after the other, as ages rolled on, Nineveh, Babylon, Ctesiphon, and Baghdad. Here God's chosen people endured a long captivity. Here the fate of nations was often decided in battles, fought by armies which had been collected from every part of the known world. Nor is this region less memorable as the site where men first sought to discover the secrets of nature. Ages ago the Chaldseans watched the motions of the planets, from the banks of the Euphrates, and the astronomers of the Khalifah el-Mamun measured the arc of a degree on the plains of Mesopotamia before Egbert had conquered the nations of the English Heptarchy. The most ancient commerce in the world was carried on by navigating the Persian Gulf and the rivers of Mesopotamia. Herodotus tells us how rafts, floating on F P 2436 THE PERSIAN GULF. inflated skins, carried 128 tons of mercliandise, down the Euphrates, from Armenia to Babylon. On the shores of the Euphrates, Alexander the Great conceived his magnificent schemes of conquest and discovery. Trajan constructed a fleet in the mountains of Nisibis, and floated it down the same river a.d . 106 ; and the Emperor Julian followed in his wake, 256 years afterwards, in 1,100 small vessels, when he made war on the Persians, a.d , 362. 1 That an extensive commerce existed between Meso potamia and India, in the time of the Sassanian kings of Persia, is evident from the fact that beams of which must have come from the coast of Malabar, have been found on the top of the ruined palace at Ctesiphon, on the Tigris. 2 During the prosperous reigns of the early Arabian Khalifahs the commerce between Baghdad and India was very important, and el-Basrah became one of the most thriving ports in the east; but since the decay of the Muhammadan nations the traffic on the rivers of Mesopotamia has become inconsiderable, though BaghdM is still a place of great trade. The river Euphrates has two sources, one a short distance north of Erzerum, and the other near Bayazid, which unite in the recesses of the Taurus, and, after a course of 1,400 miles, the river falls into the Persian Gulf. The name Euphrates, in Arabic el-FurAt, is the P'r&amp;th of Genesis ii. 14, probably a word of Aryan origin, meaning ' the good and abounding river.' 1 The historian Ammianus Marcellinus accompanied this expe- dition. 2 Colonel Colebrooke.THE EUPHRATES ROUTE. 437 The Euplirates ceases to decrease in volume about the middle of November, and thence to the end of December there is no sensible difference in its level. In March the great rising of the waters commences, and continues to the end of May, when the highest point is attained. The depth, 829 miles above el- Basrah, is then increased by 11 to 12 feet, and lower down by 15 to 18, while the current is running at the rate of five knots an hour. From May the river declines gradually in depth and speed till it reaches its lowest point in the middle of November. The Euphrates is very gradual and regular in its rise and fall; while the Tigris is more tortuous, more rapid, and more subject to irregular rises. During the low season, the Euphrates averages 300 to 450 yards in width, with a depth of from 6 to 10 feet &gt; from Bir to el-Kurnah, a distance of 829 miles From the sea to the point where the Euphrates and Tigris unite, a distance of 104 miles, the river is called the Shattu-l-Arab. The principal bar, at its mouth, has a depth of 16 feet in the low season, and at the same period the Shattu-l-'Arab averages a width of from 350 to 450 yards, and a depth of from 3 to 5 fathoms. The town of el-Basrah was founded by order of the Khalifah 'Omar in 636, and in a few years became one of the largest and most flourishing ports in the East. The Turks got possession of it in 1668. It is situated on the west bank of the Shattu-'l-'Arab, 70 miles from its mouth, and the river is navigable up to the city for vessels of 500 tons burden. The tide rises 9 feet perpendicular. el-Basrah is surrounded by438 THE PERSIAN GULF. a wall 7 miles in circumference, but the greater part of the area inside is taken up by gardens and planta tions of palm-trees, intersected by a number of small canals. 1 The streets of the town are narrow and filthily dirty ; and the bazars, though stocked with the richest merchandise, are miserable structures, roofed with matting, laid on rafters of date-trees. The sur rounding country is flat and productive. Thirty miles above el-Basrah the Euphrates and Tigris unite at a place called el-Kurnah. 186 miles above el-Kurnah the Lamlun marshes commence, and extend on either side of the river for 60 miles. When the waters are swollen, the .flat level country of the Tfl.mTiVn marshes is inundated for a breadth of 60 miles; but the moment the water recedes, in June, the land is covered with crops of rice and other grain. The main stream of the river is here from 70 to 90 yards broad, with a depth of from 6 to 9 feet. At Hillah, 86 miles above the Lamlun marshes, and 389 from el-Basrah, the river narrows for a moment to 450 feet; and the two parts of the town, fronting each other on opposite banks of the river, are connected by a bridge of boats. The soil in the vicinity is very fertile, but much neglected. Four miles north of Hillah, are the ruins of ancient Babylon; and about twenty miles north-west at the extremity of a very fine canal 1 The East India Company established a factory at el-Basrah, for the sale of woollen goods, in the middle of the last century. Sir Harford Jones was stationed there from 1784 to 1794. Mr. Manesty was agent there for twenty years, and built the British Residency, the finest building in the town. He left in 1811. Mr. Colquhoun was also stationed there, from 1806 to 1819.THE EUPHRATES EOUTE. 439 drawn from the Euphrates, and surrounded by large groves of date palms, is Kerbela, the sacred city of the Persians. The boats on the Euphrates resemble a half moon. They are covered with bitumen, have no keel, an immense rudder made of a number of spars bound together, one mast, and a lateen sail. They float down the stream to el-Basrah, but are tracked up, on their return. There are also circular boats of wicker work, covered with bitumen, and seven feet in diameter. They are described by Herodotus, and are still used on the Euphrates and Tigris. The town of Hit is 250 miles above Hillah, and about half way between el-Basrah and Bir. It is built on the western bank of the river, and there is here a bridge of boats. The district has been famous from the most ancient times for inexhaustible fountains of bitumen. From the town of Hit to the island of el-Us is 94 miles; and all the difficulties to be encountered in the navigation of the Euphrates are comprised in the 17C miles above the latter place. The country on either bank had previously been, for the most part level, but above el-Us a range of hills encloses each bank, and there are several towns and numerous islands. Aqueducts of the irrigating mills literally cover the banks, which are from 250 to 500 yards apart. The depth of the Euphrates here averages 8 feet at the lowest season, but there are several camel fords and rocky places, which occasionally reduce it to 3 and even 2^ feet. When the water is high, between March440 THE PERSIAN GULF, and August, all the rocks are covered with 14 feet of water. Anah is 106 miles above el-IJs, and Bir is 313 above 'Anah. Bir, 1,143 miles above el-Basrah, by the river, is the point where the railway from the Mediterranean would touch the Euphrates. The dis tance from Bir to the port of Scandarun is 187 miles; the country presents no engineering difficulties of any consequence, and the road is good. The great obstacle to the establishment of the Euphrates route has been fear of opposition from the wild tribes of Arabs which inhabit the surrounding country; but there can be little doubt that their assistance may be gained by prudent and con- cilatory measures, and General Chesney, who was the greatest authority on this subject, believed that when they should see the advantages that an increased traffic on the Euphrates would bring them, they would lend their cordial co-operation to the work. The Euphrates valley is the direct route to our Indian possessions ; it is the cheapest route both for constructing and working a railway, the most free from engineering difficulties, and most easily defensible by England, both its termini being upon the open sea. The importance of having an alternative route to India cannot be over-estimated. The length of a Euphrates Valley Eailway, from Alexandretta to the Persian Gulf, would be 920 miles. The cost for a line on the English gauge of 4 feet 8^ inches is estimated at 8,110,000^. For its execution it is proposed that the British Government should give a counter-guarantee on the amount of the requisite capital, which it is proposedTHE EUPHRATES ROUTE. 441 should be raised by an Ottoman loan; the Turkish Government providing the land free of charge, and furnishing specific guarantees for the due payment of the interest; privileges in regard to conveyance of troops and mails being conceded to Great Britain in perpetuity. Taking Bombay as a starting point, the route by the Euphrates to England is 320 miles shorter than that by Suez and Alexandria. Karachi is connected by a line of steam communication with the important province of the Panj^b, and will soon be joined to MuMn by a railway; and from this port the Euphrates route has a still greater advantage over the Eed Sea and Egypt, being shorter by 1,104 miles. 1 In a political point of view it is difficult to overrate the importance of the rivers of Mesopotamia ; and it is not impossible that, by delaying too long, England, and with her the whole civilised world, may lose the chance of availing herself of the Euphrates route. Already is the vulture of Turan hovering over the Armenian mountains, whose slopes are covered with splendid timber. The Eussians may not be slow in following the course of Trajan and of Julian; and once in possession of Baghdad 2 and el-Basrah, it will be a difficult and expensive work to drive them back.

These great advantages are obvious, and cannot fail eventually to receive universal assent; so that the future importance of the Persian Gulf will be very great. The island of Karak will become a great commercial dep6t, and the old town of el-Basrah will regain that opulence and prosperity which it enjoyed in the days of the Khalifah Hartin-er-Eashid. 1 1 See Vol. xxiv. of Selections fiom the Boinbay Records, 1856 (pp. 1-40, 41-44, 91—119, 121—165, 225—297, 531—6M).443 CHAPTEE XVIII. central asia. The vast territory comprised under the general name of Central Asia, the ancient Turan, includes the modern states of Khiva, Bukhara, Kokan, Kiinduz, and Badakshan, on the north of the Hindu Kush and Paropamisan ranges, and Afghanistan on the south. In the beginning of the sixteenth century the Princes of the house of Timiir were driven out of the northern half of Central Asia by Shaibany Khan and his con quering hordes of Uzbegs, who have ever since occupied the country. This territory, known to the Arabs by the name of Ma-wara-'n-Nahr, consists of vast sandy deserts, some ranges of mountains with pleasant valleys, and fertile strips of land along the banks of the rivers. Khiva, Khuwarizm, or Urjunj, the most western principality of Central Asia, is merely a large oasis separated from the Persian province of Khurasan by a wide desert, 450 miles across, which is inhabited by wandering tribes of savage Turkmans. The town of Khiva is fifteen miles from the Oxus and 240 from the Caspian Sea. It is encircled by a ruined wall; and the wretched houses are made of reeds, plastered with444 CENTRAL ASIA. clay. The surrounding country, for several miles, is studded with villages, gardens, and corn-fields, irrigated by canals from the Oxus: but where this irrigation ceases, the desert commences. The descendants of Jengiz-KMn had ruled in Khiva since the time when Shaibany conquered all the king doms of Turan. From 1642 to 1663 Abu-'l-GMzy, the famous historian, was Khan of Khiva; 1 and in 1714 his grandson, Hajji Muhammad Bahadur, sent an embassy to St. Petersburgh. In 1719 Peter the Great sent a force of 2,500 men, in several vessels, under the command of General Beckowitz (a Circassian), to take possession of a part of the east coast of the Caspian, and open a negotiation with the KMn of Khiva. The troops were landed, a fort was built, and the Khivans, who made an attack upon them, were repulsed. Beckowitz then advanced into the country; but having separated his force into small parties, to go in different directions in search of water, they were nearly all either cut to pieces, or sold into slavery by the Khan of Khiva. A remnant of the Kussians escaped, in their vessels, to Astrakhan. Nadir Shah totally ruined Khiva in his retributive invasion in 1740. On his death, an Uzbeg named Muhammad Amin Khan, assisted by the Tamut Turkmans, seized upon the supreme power at Khiva. He was succeeded by his son Iman KMn in 1792, who was followed by his son Iltenazar in 1800. The latter was drowned in the Oxus, when on his way to invade Bukhara in 1804. His son Muhammad Eahim Khan then became Khan of Khiva, and received the 1 See p. 231.KHIVA. Eussian Mission under Muravieff. He died in 1826 ; and his son Allah Kuli Khan reigned from 1826 to 1841. In March 1855 the KMn of Khiva was surprised sind killed by a chief of Tekeh Turkmans of Merv, when at a distance from his troops, surveying a fight between them and a body of Turkman and Persian irregular horse, at Sarakhs. His successor took several Yamut Turkmans into his pay. In March 1856, they, one day, entered his audience-room at Khiva, and publicly murdered him. They then retired, but the affairs of Khiva remained in great confusion, for a long time. Eventually, Seyyid Muhammad became Kh&amp;n. Khiva is supplied with European goods by Eussia, from Orenburgh, a caravan journey of 940 miles over a desert thinly inhabited by the wandering Kirgiz; but it was also the chief mart for the unfortunate slaves stolen from Persia, in the Turkman chapaus; and, as such, the place, with its vile population of man stealers, deserved some terrible punishment. 1 The Oxus divides Khiva from Bukhara. This famous river rises in the table-lands of Pamir, 2 and after t 1 Tlie Khan had under him four Inags (younger brothers or rela tions), one of them always governor of the province of Hezaresp; next comes the NaMh, or 4 spiritual chief;' the Bi, who is always at the right hand of the Khan in battle ; the Atalik, a sort of Coun cillor of State ; the Kush Begi, or Wazir ; and the Mehter, who has charge of the internal affairs of the court.

The river flows past Khiva into the Sea of Aral, fertilizing a tract of about one mile on either bank. It is navigable and free from rocks as far as Kundz, a distance of 600 miles, but there are vast swamps at its mouth. Its average depth is never less than nine feet, and the current flows at the rate of four knots an hour. The inundations commence in May and end in October, and the river is often frozen over in the winter. Large flat bottomed boats are used on the river, fifty feet long by eighteen feet wide, with the gunwale three feet above the water when loaded. They are made of logs of wood clamped together with iron, and 150 men might be embarked on one of them. A bridge of these boats has usually been used by conquerors, in all ages, to transport their invading armies across the Oxus. On the east side of the Oxus is the Principality of Bukhara, which is divided by a desert from Khiva on the west, and by a mountain range from Kokan 1 on the east. The town of Bukhara is 390 miles from Mash-had by the caravan route which crosses the Oxus at Char-jui, where the river is 650 yards across, with an average depth of nine feet. It is 290 miles north of Balkh, and 1,000 from Orenburgh on the Russian frontier. It is a very large city surrounded by a high table-land, called by the natives Eoof of the World,' a name not unfitly applied to the watershed of the Indus and the Oxus.—Wood's Oxus, chap. xxi. p. 354. 1 The Arab geographers write it Khuwakand.BUKHARA. 447 brick wall, with towers at intervals, and with twelve gates. Bukhara, in a rich flat country, lies embosoned among gardens and trees, and cannot be seen from a distance. The chief place of resort is the Eajistdn, in front of the palace, a large open space. On two other sides are massive buildings, colleges of the learned, and on the fourth side is a fountain filled with water, and shaded by lofty trees. The town is full of Uzbegs, Persian slaves, and some Chinese and Armenians. In the Eajist^n the fruits are sold under the shade of a square piece of mat—grapes, melons, apricots, apples, peaches, pears, and plums. The people are very fond of tea. There is also abundance of ice, in the hot weather. The city is intersected by canals, shaded by mulberry trees. The great mosque occupies a square of 300 feet, and has a dome covered with blue enamelled tiles. It has a lofty minaret, built of bricks arranged in various patterns. There are 366 colleges in Bukhara, square buildings surrounded by a number of small cells, called Mjrus. They are well endowed ; but the students are taught nothing but theology. The surrounding country, for forty miles in every direction, is covered with villages, corn-fields, and fruit gardens. The place once enjoyed considerable trade, two caravans going yearly to Eussia, and caravans to Mash-had, Herat, and the frontier towns of China. The once splendid city of Samarkand, little better than a mass of ruins, and now fallen into the hands of the Russians, is 150 miles east of Bukhara.448 CENTRAL ASIA. When Shaibany Khan, with his Uzbegs, drove the princes of the house of Timur out of Ma-wara-'n-Nahr, early in the sixteenth century, he fixed his capital at Bukhara, and his descendants continued to reign there until the time of Nadir Shah. Shaibany himself, who was killed at the battle of Merv by Shuh Isma'il in 1500, was lineally descended from the great Jingiz- KMn. He was succeeded by his nephew 'Ubaidu'llah, who captured Mash-had, and slaughtered many of its inhabitants. 'Ubaidu'llah reigned twenty years, and was succeeded by Iskandar, a cousin of Shaibany, who reigned twelve years, and was followed by his son 'Abdallah, who reigned for thirty years. Abdu-'l- Muamin, his son, was murdered by the Umaras or nobles in six months, for tyranny; and in 1587, his cousin Wali Muhammad KMn succeeded, and reigned eighteen years. He was defeated by 'Abbas the Great near Herat; and on his death his son Imam Kuly Khan became King of Bukhara, and reigned sixteen years. In his old age he became blind, and abdicated in favour of his brother Seyyid NMir, who reigned twenty- four years, and had twelve sons. Driven out of Bu khara by the rebellion of his sons, he retired to Mekkah, and died there. His son 'Abdu-'l-'Aziz made Balkh his capital, and having reigned thirty years, he also retired and died at Mekkah. His brother Subhan Kuly Khan reigned twenty-four years, and was succeeded by his son Abulu-'l-Fida Khan, who, being weak and indolent, lost most of his dominions, but retained Bukhara. In August 1740, Midir Shah crossed the Oxus to invade Bukhara, but was conciliated by large supplies.BUKHARA. 449 and bribed not to enter the city. It was at this time that an Englishman first penetrated to these distant regions. Mr. George Thompson and Mr. Eeynold Hogg undertook to open a trade with Khiva and Bukhara in 1740. They travelled from Orenburgh, across the desert, with some Kirghiz Tatars to the Sea of Aral, and skirting along a high and rocky shore where there was only brackish water, and where horses, asses, antelopes, and wolves abounded, they reached Khiva on September 9. They soon found that no profit could be expected in proportion to the risk; Hogg, therefore, returned to Orenburgh, while the more adventurous Thompson, after visiting Bukhara, returned by Mash-had and Persia. On the departure of NMir Shah, the grand Wazir, named Eahim Kh&amp;n, dethroned and killed the indolent king, and thus put an end to the dynasty of Shaibany. Eahim KMn reigned twelve years, and his only daughter married Amir Danyil, of the race of the Mangit, who reigned twenty-four years. His son MurM, better known as the renowned Begi J&amp;n, be came Amir of Bukhara in 1783. Begi Jiln was a very singular man. On Amir Danyils death he dressed himself as a common mendicant, and went to every quarter of Bukhara, imploring forgiveness for the tyranny of his father. He then gave himself up to devotion, in the principal mosque for many months. He destroyed every drink ing and gambling house in the city, and presided every day in the hall of justice, assisted by forty Mullahs. Smoking tobacco was also forbidden, as contrary to the g e450 CENTRAL ASIA. Kuran; and the police were constantly employed in driving the people to prayers, yet, notwithstanding his own severity, Begi Jan was a great favourite of the populace. The army of Begi Jan was almost entirely composed of cavalry. After reducing all the tribes of his own nation, he besieged and destroyed Merv, and overran KhurMn, calling on the people to embrace the Sunnah belief, in 1794. From that time he made annual incursions into Khurasan, riding at the head of his army, mounted on a small pony, and dressed as a religious man of the poorest class. On his seal the following inscription was engraved: 'Power and dignity when founded on justice are from God; when not, from the Devil.' This remarkable and enterprising fanatic was suc ceeded by his very religious son Haidar, 1 who reigned until 1825, when his brother Nasru-'d-Din, became Amir of Bukhara, and reigned (when Burnes was there in 1835),' with a just and impartial hand.' The Amir of Bukhara was very fond of learning and of learned men of the Sunnah sect. He was described as tall and handsome, leading a simple life, and very fond of preaching to the people from a pulpit. He lectured every morning to pupils on the Sunnah traditions, afterwards dispensed justice according to 1 Haidar introduced a era of bigotry. He took tlie name of Amiru-l-Muslimin, ' Commander of the Muslims/ and per formed the duties of a priest rather than those of a king, read prayers over the dead, disputed in the mosques, and taught in the colleges.btjkhAea and kokan. 451 the laws of the Kiiran, and in the afternoon conversed with learned Mullahs. It is also said that, when any of his subjects died he repaired to the house, and said funeral prayers. The U1 amahs, or heads of religion, rank next to the king, who is absolute ; and then follow the Umaras or nobles, headed by the Diwdn-Begi, or Prime Minister. The great mass of the population consists of Uzbegs, who are said to be honest and good tempered, and fond of horse flesh, and or intoxicating drink made from mares' milk, but there are also many wandering Turkmans, and other tribes in the territory of Bukhara. To the east of Bukhara is the little principality of Kokdn, which was long almost entirely unknown to Europeans. It was once the kingdom of Farghanah before the princes of the house of Timur were driven out of this part of Asia. BUber, the founder of the Mogul Empire in India, has given a minute description of it. 1 It is now about 200 miles long by 150 broad, and the present capital of Kok&amp;n is on the banks of the Jaxartes. Narbak Khan, the sovereign of Kokan, in the end of the last century, had two sons. 'Alain KMn, who succeeded him, was a tyrant, and was murdered by Omar KMn in 1806, who then became Khan of Kokftn. He was still reigning in 1820, and was then described as a mild, good, and equitable sovereign; and his nobles were fond of riding, hawking, and getting drunk. The village system of government 1 See page 237. o a 2 H452 CENTRAL ASIA. prevailed. The town of Kokan was only a little village, previous to the time of Narbak Khan, but, since be coming the seat of government, it has greatly increased. It has no walls, and is watered by the Jaxartes, on the banks of which it is built, sixty miles east by north of Khojend. 1 The two great rivers of Central Asia, the Jaxartes or Syr, and the Oxus or Amft, empty themselves into the Sea of Aral, which is 200 miles long by 150 broad. The Sea of Aral, {AralTenghiz, or ' Sea of Islands'), is thirty-seven fathoms deep, in the deepest part, but the shores are constantly rising. The water is about as salt as the Gulf of Finland, near Croustadt, and this brackish condition is probably caused by the enormous volume of fresh water which is poured into the sea by the Oxus on its southern, and the Jaxartes on its north-eastern side. The mouths of these rivers are much obstructed by sand. The eastern coast is sandy, with hills of sand mixed with clay rising to a height of about eighty feet, and several salt lakes. The ground is covered with steppe brushwood, chiefly jonquil, or camel thorn, as well as 1 1861. Kokan has a fertile soil, easily irrigated; pomegranates, grapes, and apricots abound. There is trade with China and the Russian settlements. Ak Masjid, the Russian fort on the Jaxartes, is 250 miles from Kokan. The king takes one-fifth of the grain produce, and a money rate on fruit and vegetables, one in forty of horses and cattle, and duties on merchandise. The total revenue is reported to be twenty-one lakhs of rupees. The State is frequently engaged in hostilities with Bukhara.— Panjab Reports^ 1860-61, p. 54. The Principality will be fully described in the forthcoming work of M. Fedchenko.THE SEA OF AEAL. 453 the adjacent isles, and the margins of the coast are lined with beds of reeds. The northern coast is an argillaceous table-land, about 300 feet high, abrupt towards the south, a wild and barren desert. The isles of Kug Aral and Barsa Kilmis are of the same character. The western coast is composed of the table-land of Ust-Urt, about 300 feet high, abrupt towards the sea, composed of argillaceous schist and sandstone. This desert is inhabited by the Kirghiz Tatars ; and the caravans from Khiva to Orenburgh pass across it. The southern coast is entirely flat, and covered with vast swamps, formed by the mouths of the Oxus. In the adjacent country the nomade tribes of Karakaplaks seek pasture, subject to the king of Khiva. Near the centre of the sea are the Islands of the Czar, covered with steppe underwood, and inhabited by numbers of antelopes. On the coasts and islands of the Aral there are innumerable flocks of pelicans, cormorants, sea gulls, terns, geese, and ducks ; and the sea abounds in sturgeon, bony pikes, and many kinds of smaller fish, but there are no seals. Many wild hogs live in the reeds of the eastern coast, and tigers roam along the sands. The Jaxartes and part of the Sea of Aral are usually frozen over in the winter. 1 1 Survey of the Sea of Aral, by Commander A. Butakoff. In 1847 a small vessel, the ^Nicliolas,' was built at Orenburgh, on the model of the Caspian fishing boats, transported in pieces across the steppe to the Jaxartes, and launched. The Russians surveyed the northern coast of the Sea of Aral in her, in 1848. In 1848 the flat-bottomed schooner, 1 Constantine,' fifty feet long, was transported in pieces across the steppe, and put together at the454 CENTRAL ASIA. South of BukMra and Kokan is the region of the Upper Oxus. It comprises the famous Pamir table land on the east, the mountain ranges of the Karatau and Hindu Kush on the north and south, and the valleys down which the streams flow from those heights to form the Oxus. The width from Karatau to the Hindu Kush may average 250 miles, and the length from the summit of the Pamir plateau to below Balkh, where the lower course of the Oxus may be said to commence, is about 450 miles. It comprises Khulm, Kunduz, Badakshan, and some mountain chiefships. Kunduz thus is north of the Hindu Kush and south of the Oxus. It was long ruled by an Amir of an Uzbeg family, who was named Murad 'Aly Beg when Burnes passed through it in 1833. 1 He retained all fort of Aralsk or Eaim. She was launched into the Syr in August 1848, and M. Butakoff completed the survey of the sea of Aral in her in 1848-9. The Eussians have a fishery in the sea, and a fort at Aralsk near the mouth of the Jaxartes. 1 In 1824 Mr. Moorcroft was at Kunduz, and MmM Beg ex torted 23,000 rupees from him before he would allow him to depart. He then went to Bukhara, but died on his return, about eighty miles from Balkh, His companion, Mr. Trebeck, also died of fever, near Balkh. Murad Beg was an Uzbeg of tall stature, harsh Tatar features, eyes small to deformity, forehead broad and frowning, and no beard. Kiinduz is situated in a valley, surrounded on all sides by hills, except the north, where the Oxus flows at a distance of about forty miles. The climate is very insalubrious. The valley is marshy, and the roads are constructed on piles of wood, and run through the rankest weeds. The chief never visits it but in winter. The snowy moun tains of Hindil Kfrsh are in sight, to the south.—Burnes, vol. ii. p. 196. Sir A. Burnes sent Dr. Lord and Lieut. J. Wood, I.N., to Kun duz, on the invitation of the Khan, to cure his brother of ophthal-KUNDUZ. 455 the petty chiefs in their authority, but stipulated for a contingent of troops when required ; and was thus able to bring 20,000 horse and six field-pieces into the field. His cavalry carried immense spears, and a few had matchlocks. The revenue was paid in kind. 1 On the death of Murad 'Aly Beg in 1836, an Uzbeg chief named Muhammad Amin Khan seized upon Kiinduz, Khulm, Balkh, and Badakshan ; and assumed the title of Mir Waly. He permitted Eustan Khan, son of Murad, to retain the government of Kiinduz, made his own son Genj 'Aly Beg, governor of Badakshan, and fixed his capital at Khulm, which is about twenty miles east of Balkh and seventy west of Kiinduz. Khulm consists of four or five villages on a plain, connected together by large gardens. The residence of the Mir W&amp;ly was in a fortress upon a hill. His revenue was 24,000/. in silver and 50,000/. in cereal produce; and besides his army of cavalry, he had ten field-pieces of large calibre. He was still reigning when Mr. Ferrier was at Khulm in 1845. But Kiinduz was occupied by Dost Muhammad in 1859, and his son Afzal Khan held his ground, in spite of the hostility of the people and of the chiefs of Maimuna. Andkhoi, Kiinduz and Badakshan are now tributary to Shir Aly Kh^n, son of Dost Muhammad, the present ruler of Afghanistan. mia in October 1836. Kunduz was then a wretched place, con sisting of 5,000 or 6,000 mud hovels, with gardens and cornfields in the suburbs. The Tajiks of Kunduz are a Caucasian race, perhaps the indigenous race of Persia and Transoxiana. The Uzbegs inter marry with them, and their physiognomy is thus becoming softened. ^ Next to Kunduz. the chief towns are Khana-i-bad, and Talikhan. i. i IR' I . • /r\456 CENTEAL ASIA. Balkh, 4 the mother of cities,' was long a bone of contention between the Amir of Bukhara, the Chief of Kiinduz, and the Afghans—sometimes in the hands of one, sometimes of another. Its once splendid bazars and mosques are now a mass of ruins. 1 Badakshan 2 is a mountainous region above Kiinduz, and in the upper part of the valley of the Oxus. The people are of the Tajik 3 race, and possessed the country before the inroads of Turks and Uzbegs. They are a wild people living in villages, surrounded by gardens, in the little glens and ravines of the hills. Marco Polo mentions that the chief of Badakshan laid claim to Grecian origin ; Baber corroborates the story; and Elphinstone says that the Chief of Darwaz, in the vale of the Oxus, was a Macedonian. Burnes mentions that the Chiefs of Kulab, Shighnan, and Wakhan, north of the Oxus, lay claim to the same descent; and he 1 The ruins of Balkh, 1 the mother of cities 1 (Immu-'l-Balad), ex tend for a circuit of about twenty miles. They consist of fallen mosques and tombs of sun-dried bricks. It was seized by the Amir of Bukhara, from the Afghans, in about 1824^ It stands on a plain about six miles from the hills.

Balkh, and where the desolated tombs Of Parthian kings scatter to the wind Their wasting dust.—Shelley's Alastor, p. 43. 2 Wood's opinion is that Badakshan was first peopled from Balkh. The country seems to have been subject to the Great Moguls, and afterwards to the Dflranis. Prior to the Uzbeg invasion, the BadaksMnis were Shia'ahs; and the Tajik hill tribes still retain that creed. 3 The Tajiks are a handsome race of the Caucasian stock, and speak Persian.—Wood's Oxus, p. 295.mm BADAKSHAN AND THE PAMIE. 457 believes in the descent of several of the Chiefs of Badakshan from the Greeks of Bactria. 1 The Pamir table-land containing the sources of the Oxus, which flow thence through Badakshan is the central boss or converging point of the Asiatic mountain systems. Humboldt looked upon it as a range running north and south, and connecting the Thian-Slian with the Himalaya. Some Eussian geographers, with whom Colonel Yule seems inclined to agree, consider the Pamir to be a knot whence the lines of the Thian-Shan and the Himalayas diverge. But, for the correct appreciation of the bearings of its geographical features on political questions, the Pamir should, to all intents 1 In 1823 BadaksMn made a last stand for independence against the KMn of Kunduz, under Mirza Beg Khan, with 1,000 men. Murad Beg had 10,000. The conquered Badakshanis fell back on FaizaMd. The kings of Badakshein passed the summer at FaizaMd, and the winter in the pretty vale of Mashid. Of Faizabad, the former capital of Badakshan, scarce a vestige was left, except the withered trees which once ornamented the gardens, when Wood was there. It was destroyed by Murad Beg, who forcibly removed 4ihe inhabitants to Kunduz. The capital of Badakshan was Jerm, a cluster of scattered hamlets, with a popula tion of 1,500. South of Jerm are the lapis-lazuli mines, in the valley of the Kokcha, about 200 yards wide, with high and naked mountains on either side. The formation is of black and white limestone. The ruby mines are in a district called Gharam, on the right bank of the Oxus. A great deal of snow falls in Badakshan in the winter. The rooms, if large, are supported in the centre by four stout pillars, within which the floor is considerably lower than in the other parts, and the benches thus formed are carpeted with felts, and form the seats and bed-places of the family. The walls are thick, and covered with mud. Household utensils are kept in niches in the walls.—Wood's Oxus, 1837. Faizabad has since regained some of its prosperity, and is again the capital of Badakshan. . ■ Kfl id I ' if 3458 CENTRAL ASIA. and purposes, be viewed as a continuation of the great Himalayan plateaux. From this point of view, we see the lofty mass, called Pamir in one part, Karakorum in another, Kuen-lun in another, rising to an average height of 15,000 feet, and pouring forth its waters to east and west; those to the east draining off to the desert on the confines of China, those to the west form ing rivers, the Oxus and the Indus, which empty them selves into the Aral Sea and the Indian Ocean, The Pamir peaks and table-lands are at too great an eleva tion to be permanently habitable ; but the streams flow ing on them have formed gorges and valleys where small tribes have dwelt from the most ancient times. Each, in its isolated territory, speaks a separate dialect, but they are few in number, and have suffered cruelly from the inroads of barbarous conquerors who have occupied the lower valleys of the Oxus basin. These mountaineers are Tajiks of the pure Aryan stock; and their valleys are believed to be the original cradles in remote antiquity of the Indo-Germanic races, the old homes of our ancestors. There are nine or ten of these mountain tribes in the valleys which descend from the western side of the Pamir and Karakorum ranges. The first six are within the Oxus basin, and the others are in that of the Indus. Commencing from the north, where the Karatau mountains diverge in a westerly direction from the northern end of the Pamir, we have the people of Karategin in the valley of the Surkh-ab, the great northern affluent of the Oxus. Their country has never been visited by a European, although M. Fedchenko, who was near the source of the Surkh-ab,DABWAZ, SHIGHNAN, AND WAKHAN. 459 on the AM plateau, and General Abramoff have collected some information respecting Karategin. Yet Colonel Yule says, that it is one of the least known regions of Asia. Next come Kulab, and Darwaz, and Eoshan, of which nothing is known at all from actual observation. Darwaz means ' an open door,' and was doubtless a district through which one of the roads across the Pamir passed. Then comes Shighnan, of which M. Fedchenko heard some particulars, but it has never been visited by any European. Then Wakhan, the gorge through which flows the Panja or main stream of the Oxus, and which is inhabited by about 500 families. Captain Wood is the only European who has ever visited it. He entered Wakhan, from Badakshan, by the Ishkashm Pass, 10,920 feet above the sea. He then ascended the Wakhan valley, on the south side of the Panja river, passing through three villages, Ishkashm (forty-five houses), Ishtrakh (fifteen houses), and Kundut (thirty-five houses). Beyond MndM he crossed the river and came to Langar Kaish (twenty-five houses), at a height of 10,800 feet above the sea. This is the last inhabited place before the Pamir table-land is reached. But a southern branch of the Panja, explored by Major Montgomerie's Mirza, is not so lofty, and its valley contains several villages. Then comes Chitral, which though on a river which joins the Kabul, an affluent of the Indus, is occupied by mountaineers of the same race as those on the Oxus tributaries, and is only separated from the Wakhan valley by a low ridge. Then Yasin, and Gilgit, also gorges, with streams flowing to the Indus.460 CENTRAL ASIA. The Aryan inhabitants of these valleys raise crops of barley; but their country is unproductive and their climate rigorous, so that they are dependent on the people of the plains below for many necessaries. It is likely that their country contains great mineral wealth. Its ruby and lapis-lazuli mines have been famous since the days of Marco Polo and Clavijo; and, next to the slave trade, the principal business of FaizabM, the capital of Badakshau, is the casting of iron. Although the mountain chiefs are virtually independent, it is likely enough that they have usually acknowledged a sort of feudal suzerainty in the rulers who have from time to time been in possession of the lower and richer parts of the valleys. Karategin has wavered in its allegiance between Kokan and Kunduz, according to the power of their respective rulers. Of Shighnan we know httle or nothing. Wakhan, and sometimes Chitral, have generally acknowledged the supremacy of Badakshan. Yasin and Gilgit owe fealty to Kashmir. The lofty mountain chains which encompass these valleys form natural frontiers : the Karatau between the allies of our Indian Government and the Uzbeg Khanats, whose succession is claimed by Eussia; and the Pamir between our own territories and those of our Afghan neighbour on the one side, and the dominions of the Atalik GMzy in Iv ash gar on the other. The valleys leading to the Pamir contain the immemorial tracks of merchants passing across Asia, between the western countries and China. There are two principal caravan routes across Central Asia. One passes by BnkMra and Samarkand, on the northern side of the KaratauCOMMERCIAL ROUTES. 461 Mountains, and over the Terek Pass to Kashgar. This is already in the hands of the Eussians, since they occupied Samarkand in 1866. The other passes up the valley of the Oxus, by Balkh and Faizabad, and then up one or other of the gorges to the Pamir table land, whence it descends the eastern slopes to Kashgar. It was mainly by this latter route that communications were kept up between China and the Western world from the most ancient times. It was traversed by Marco Polo in the 13th century, by Benedek Goez in 1603, and by the agent of Major Montgomerie two or three years ago. There appear to be several routes across the bleak and inhospitable Pamir. One is from Faizabad and up the Wakhan valley, another through Darwaz, and another by Karategin to Kokan. Kiinduz and Badakshan are separated from Kabul by the snow-clad mountains of the Hindu Kush, which are inhabited by wild tribes of Kafirs or infidels. 1 There are several passes over this mighty range. The most lofty, named Hajjiguk, attains an height of 13,000 feet above the level of the sea; Kalfii is also nearly 13,000, but the other passes do not exceed 9,000 feet. 2 1 The Siah Posh, or' black-vested Kafirs' are handsome men, with open foreheads, blue eyes, and black hair. They abhor the Mus lims, who kidnap them for slaves. They pride themselves on being brothers of the Feringis ; and believe in the supremacy of a Deity, and that men who have been good and hospitable on earth will be rewarded in heaven. 'Wood believes them to be of the same race as the Tajiks of BadaksMn, and that on the invasion of the Mu- hammadans they fled into the fastnesses of the mountains.—Wood's Oxus, p. 288. 2 The pass of CTnna is about 11,000 feet high, and winds past the snow-clad Koh-i-Baba, a remarkable ridge with three peaks,462 CENTEAL ASIA. From the plains of Balkh and Kunduz the mountains rise in a bold and precipitous line, their sides bare, black, and polished. All the passes of the Hindu Kiish are free from snow previous to the end of June, but they are destitute of wood. The defiles are very- tortuous, forming distinct inclosures, as it were, every half mile, with mural precipices on each side of the road, rising up to 2,000 or 3,000 feet in perpendicular height. The only fuel is stunted thorny furze; but the pasture is good in many places, and the people rear barley and very fine fruit-trees, especially apricots, in the valleys. The peak of Koh-i-Baba, above the Kalil Pass, is covered with eternal snow. The peaks are granite, and the sides of the defile of Kalu, which is nevermore than 200 yards across, are micaceous schist. In a defile of the Hindft Kush near Bammiyan, lead, copper, tin, and antimony ores are found. South of the mountains of the Hindu Kush is the country of the Afghans, which we left (at the end of the chapter on Nadir Shah) under the dominion of Tim fir, the son of Ahmed 'Abdallah, the founder of the Diirany dynasty. Timftr died in 1793, and was succeeded by his son Zam&amp;n Shah, who passed his reign in threatened in vasions of India. The English authorities were kept in constant alarm ; and one of the chief objects of Malcolm's mission to Persia, in 1800, was to negotiate a league against the dreaded Afghan invader. about 18,000 feet liigli.

He, however, com manded both the entrances into India, by which, in all ages, the conquerors have poured their hosts into its fertile plains—the Khaibar and the Bolan Passes, The Khaibar Pass, leading from Kabul to PesMwur, was the route taken by Alexander the Great, Timftr, Baber, and Nadir Shah. The road winds through narrow defiles in the mountains. At Aly Masjid the mountains, on either side, rise to a height of 1,300 feet, slaty and bare, and the defile, though a mile long, is nowhere more than twenty-five paces broad. After this ravine the mountains recede, and a fine view of the Khaibar valley (1,500 paces broad) is obtained; and the road leads into the valley of the Kdbul river. Nadir Sh&amp;h, with heavy artillery, passed the Khaibar, but he gave large sums of money to the wild tribes, to secure a quiet passage. Peshawar, at the foot of the Khaibar Pass, is in a plain thirty-five miles long, and enclosed on all sides but the east, by mountains. It is fifty-one miles from Atak, on the Indus, a fortress founded by the Emperor. Akbar in 1581, at the point where invading armies have usually crossed that famous river. It is here 260 yards broad, with a current of six knots an hour. The Bolan Pass is more difficult than the Khaibar, and leads from Sind by Quettah, to Kandahar. It runs for ten miles, in a tortuous course, with not sufficient breadth for a dozen horsemen to ride abreast.464 CENTRAL ASIA. and rocks rising, like walls, to a great height on either side. Ahmed 'Abdallah entered Sind by the Bolan Pass. But the danger hanging over India from the ambitious schemes of Zaman Shah was only imaginary. He fell a victim to his own treacherous ingratitude. Poyndah Khan, the powerful chief of the Barukhzy tribe, whose wisdom had sustained the fortunes of Timftr and who had supported Zaman on his accession, was murdered by that ungrateful Prince. He left twenty-two sons, who now had their father's murder to avenge. Fat-h Khan, the eldest of these sons, fled into Persia, aud leagued himself with MahmM, the turbulent brother of Zaman. They besieged Kandahar with a handful of cavalry, took the king prisoner, and put his eyes out, in 1801. Zaman Shah escaped into India, and, for nearly half a century, the threatened invader of Hindustan was a pensioner on British bounty at LlkMna. MahmM, who then succeeded to the Afghan throne, was a haughty, indolent, rapacious barbarian. His brother Shuja'-'l-Mulk attempted to oppose him, but was defeated by Fat-h KMn near Kabul. Soon afterwards, however, a rebellion broke out at Kabul, Fat-h Khan fled, and Sliuja entered the capital in triumph. MahmM threw himself at his brother s feet, and was forgiven. Mountstuart Elphinstone was sent on an embassy to Shah Shuja' at PesMwur, and was cordially received. A treaty was signed by which the Afghan king boundAFGHANISTAN. 465 himself not to allow the French or Persians to invade India, a.d . 1808. But almost immediately on the departure of the English Envoy, Shuji' was defeated by Fat-h Khan in 1809, and took refuge at Lahore. Here his host, old Eanjit Sing, robbed him of his diamond, the famous Ivuh-i-N ur, and in 1816 he fled to LMi&amp;na. MahmM again seated himself on the Afghan throne, with Fat-h KMn as his minister, to whom he gave up all real power. At this time the since famous Dost Muhammad, a younger brother of Fat-h KMn, first rose into notice, and became the favourite of his powerful kinsman. He was the son of a Kuzilbash woman, sprung from the military Persian colonies which had been settled in Afghanistan, and was despised by the great Durany ladies. As a boy he was employed in the menial office of sweeper of the sacred cenotaph of Lamech. But his graceful person, his courage, activity, enterprise, and sagacity attracted the notice of his elder brother, and at the age of fourteen he was the favourite and lieutenant of Fat-h KMn. The great Afghan minister had an interview with Eanjit Sing, to obtain permission to cross his territory for the reconquest of Kashmir, with his eighteen stalwart brothers standing round him ; but in 1811 Eanjit seized upon Atak. During the reign of Timur, and through all these feuds and revolts in Afghanistan, Hajji Firftz, a brother of Mahmud, had reigned quietly as governor of Herat. In 1810 Mahmud demanded tribute from Herat, and Hajji Firftz refused it. Fat-h Khan led an army h h466 CENTRAL ASIA. to the walls, and his brother Dost Muhammad entered as a friend. He then threw off his treacherous mask, massacred the guard, seized Prince Hajji Firuz, and finally tore the jewels off a lady of the harem, which drew an oath from Prince Kamran, MahmM's son, that he would avenge her. Kamran, therefore, collected a large force, advanced to Herat, took Fat-h Khan prisoner and Dost Muhammad escaped to Kashmir. Mahmud and his son Kamran then tried to force Fat-h Khan to betray his brother, and, on his refusal, they hacked him to pieces. His nose, ears, lips, fingers, arms, and legs were chopped off, one by one, in their presence. He raised no cry, the brave chief's fortitude was unshaken to the last. Dost Muhammad swore to avenge his brothers murder, and terribly did he keep his oath. From the blood of Fat-h Khan rose the power of his brothers, the famous Barukhzy Sirdars, who soon conquered all Afghanistan, except Herat. Dost Muhammad occupied Kabul, his brother Kohun-dil-Khan seized upon Kandahar ; and in 1818 Mahmud, the Durany sovereign, had nothing left but the little principality of Herat.

He advanced to Kandahar, but was entirely defeated by Dost Muhammad and his son Akbar Khan, and escaped to his place of exile at Ludi&amp;na. In 1829 Mahmud died at Herat, and was succeeded in the government of that small principality by his son Kamran, 1 while the Barukhzy Sirdars ruled the rest of Afghanistan. Herat is well fortified with a wet ditch, and wall with five gates. It has four long bazars, roofed with arched brickwork, which meet in a domed quadrangle in the centre of the city. It is situated in a beautiful and fertile valley, watered by the river Heri-Eud. Herat is the c gate of India.'

In 1838, when the Persians besieged Herat, he supplied them with provisions, but returned to his allegiance on their depar ture. Mizrab Khan died in 1839, and was succeeded by Hukumat Khan. In 1849, being embroiled with some of his family, the Waly asked Yar Muhammad for assistance, who came with an army of 3,000 men and six guns. The Waly then made an expedi tion again Khairabad, 30 miles from Maimunah; a strong fort held by Shir Khan, the Waly's brother, which they destroyed. While at Khairabad, Kuzumfer Khan, nephew of Sufi Khan, the independent ruler of Andkhoi, came to Yar Muhammad, and offered him a bribe, if he would depose his uncle. He agreed, and the uncle surrendered; but Andkhoi was sacked by the Heraty soldiery. They then marched to Shibargan; but its chief boldly h H 2 1 iilii ■ ' 11468 CENTEAL ASIA. modern army , can march, from the north and west, towards India. The great importance of this place, so blessed by nature, so cursed by the tyranny of man, has long been apparent to European statesmen; and when, as will be seen in the next chapter, the ambition of the new Shah of Persia was turned in this direction, it became the policy of England to frustrate his designs, which were backed up by the intrigues of Russia; and attention was for several years concentrated on the politics of Central Asia. 1 Sistan, 2 the province intervening between Persia and Afghanistan, and of which so much is heard in the earliest periods of Persian history, is divided by Sir Frederic Goldsmid into 'Sistan Proper' and 'Outer Sistan.' The former covers about 947 square miles, and has a fixed population of some 35,000 souls, with closed his gates against them. Yar Muhammad then returned to Herat. _ , The Waly of Maimunali continued his allegiance to Herat, by the annual present of a few horses ; but he took no active part in the defence of Herat in 1856. Muhammad AfzulKMn, ruler of Balkh, in 1857, made exorbitant demands on the and conquered Maimfinah in 1860. ^ The population of Maimunah is 40,000 families, almost all Uzbegs. The army consists of 12,000 horse. The fort is strong, with a wet ditch all round. It has one 36-pounder and four 6-pounders, all serviceable. Maimunah is celebrated for its breed of horses, which are small but hardy. Immense quantities of wheat, barley, and rice are culivated and exported. 1 The Hazarah and Eimiks occupy the whole of the mountain belt from Kabul to Herat. The former on the eastern part, and are quite a Tatar race, uglier than the Uzbegs. They strongly resemble the Kirghiz of Pamir. The Hazarah nation of the Paropamisan lange has a population of 156,000 souls. They used to pay a tribute in slaves to the Khan of Kdnduz. They are Shia ahs. 2 More correctly Sijistan.SISTAN. 469 10,000 nomades in addition. This gives forty-eight to the square mile. The country consists of tracts of alluvium with mounds and rising grounds, and many old ruins and vestiges of a former civilisation. It has bushes, but no trees, and yields crops of barley, beans, and oil seeds. The famous Lake of Zirrah was dry at the time of Sir Frederic Goldsmid's visit. There were merely pools and hollows of water at the mouths of the Helmund, Farak-EM, and other feeders. A canal brings the waters of the Helmund into the heart of the country. North of Sistan is the district of Lash-Jowain, and, from its position, the tract of country comprised in these provinces has long been a bone of contention between the Persian Government and the Afghans. Timur Shah, son of Ahmed Abdallah, appointed a chief named Muhammad Zaman Khan to be Governor of Sistan and Lash-Juwain in the beginning of the present century; with his residence in the fort of Lash. When Sirdar Barkhudar was appointed to succeed him, he laid waste the country, slaughtering women and even children. The next Governor was Sirdar Imdad Khan, who collected the revenue without opposition, and returned to Kandahar. The Sistan people con tinued their submission to Afghanistan during the reigns of TimUr Shah and his son Mahmud. But when the Barukhzy Sirdars drove MahmM to Herat, Sistan became independent, until it was subdued by Kamran of Herat at the head of 6,000 men. When the Persian besieged Herat in 1838 (see the next chapter) Sistan again rebelled. Subsequent feuds between the Eulers of Herat and Kandahar enabled the Sistanis to maintain470 CENTRAL ASIA. their independence of both; but the native rulers are shocking barbarians. One of them 'Aly Khan, in 1841, murdered Dr. Forbes in cold blood with his own hand; and when the same man went to Tehran in 1858, to obtain the support of Persia, he received the hand of a Kajar Princess, first cousin of the Shah. The preceding sketch of the history and position of the various States which are comprised in the general term of Central Asia, is intended to render more clear the modern annals of Persia, from the accession of Muhammad Shah in 1835 to the present time. Owing to the unwise ambition of the half educated and semi- barbarous Kajar Shahs on the one hand, and to the policy of their Turanic neighbour on the other, modern Persian history is inextricably mixed up with the progress of events in Central Asia.471 CHAPTEE XIX. the kajak dynasty. Reign of Muhamm On the death of Fat-h 'Aly SMh, Muhammad was not suffered to succeed in peace. There were two other competitors for the throne, amongst the hundreds of the old king's descendants ; but the wonder was that there were not twenty, instead of two, considering the way in which the princes had been brought up, placed in independent governments in the provinces, and sur rounded by vile flatterers. Muhammad was at Tabriz, making preparations for a march on the capital. Prince 'Aly Mirza, full brother of Abbas Mirza, with the title of Zil-i-Sultan, was governor of the citadel at Tehran ; and, on his father's death, he declared himself a competitor for the throne. He was supported by the Amiru-'d-Daulah, the old SMh's chief minister, and most of the courtiers. Prince Hasan 'Aly Mirza, Governor of Pars, with the title of Firman-firma, also proclaimed his right to the throne at Shiraz. He was a man without ability, but well supplied with money. But Muhammad was supported by his father's veteran472 HISTORY OF PEESIA. army, by many nobles of distinction, and by the power of England. The Kaim-Makam, his father's minister, retained his office ; but the most important supporter of Muhammad was his maternal uncle, Alayar Khan. This chief was the head of the Yukary-Msh, or senior branch of the Kajar tribe, and the old Shah had married his sister to Prince 'AbMs Mirza, who became the mother of Muhammad. Alayar Khan received the title of Asafu-'d-Daulah, ' Wazir of the Empire,' and was, at this time, the most powerful nobleman in Persia. A short time before the old SMh's death a British detachment of officers under Colonel Pasmore, and including the distinguished names of Sheil and Eawlinson had arrived in Persia, to discipline the troops. They were all at Tabriz, and Sir Henry Bethune (the Lindsay of former days) took command of the new SMh's army. But Muhammad's treasury was ex hausted, and he could not commence his march on the capital without paying the troops, and procuring supplies. Sir John Campbell, the English minister, with the subsequent sanction of Government, therefore advanced him a large sum of money, and thus enabled him to secure the throne. The army marched from Tabriz, under the command of Sir Henry Bethune, early in 1835, and at Kazvin it was joined by the Ily&amp;ts under Menucheher Khan, a Eussian Armenian renegade. Zil-i-Sultan made no attempt at resistance, and Muhammad entered Tehran in triumph, and was installed as the third Shah of Persia of the Kajar race. Sir Henry Bethune then marched to Shiraz; theMUHAMMAD SHAH. 473 insurgent troops fled before him, and lie entered the city on March 15, 1835, having taken the Firm&amp;n- flrma prisoner. No atrocities stained the commence ment of the reign of Muhammad Shah ; and his rivals, the Zil-i-SuMn and Firman-firma were allowed to retire to Khoi and Kerbela, with small pensions. 1 The K&amp;im-MaMm, however, was imprisoned and murdered in June 1835. The Asafu-'d-Daulah was appointed Governor of Khurasan; Menucheher Khan, with the title of Mu'tamu-'d-Daulah, became governor of Ghilan, and in 1837 was removed to Kirmanshah; and Prince Bahram Mirza, the SMh's brother, was made governor of Azerbaijan. The office of Prince Minister was con ferred upon Hajji Mirza Aghasy, a native of Erivan, who soon attained unlimited influence over his weak-minded master. He had formerly been the Shah's tutor, and professed the Sufy doctrine : a quizzical old gentleman, with a long nose, whose countenance betokened the oddity and self-sufficiency of his character. He was wholly devoted to the Russian interest. 2 The Shah's son, a child named Msru-'d-Din, was proclaimed Wali Ahd, or Heir Apparent. On the accession of Muhammad SMh, the English Government determined to transfer the superintendence of the Persian Mission, once more from the Government 1 Three sons of the Firman-firm^ visited England in 1837, under the care of Mr. Eraser. 2 The Hajji could write a tolerable letter, and read the Kuran, but was without any other literary attainments. He always affected great humility. He had formerly been half valet, half tutor, to Shah Muhammad.474 HISTORY OF PERSIA. of India to the home authorities; and in November 1835 Sir Henry Ellis arrived at Tehran as Envoy, to congratulate the new Shah. 1 Sir Henry Ellis was received by the new Shah on November 5, 1835. He was conducted through the palace, by a dark passage into a large court, ornamented with stiff rows of chenar-trees and oblong tanks. A brick pavilion is built across it, where the Shah gives audience to his subjects, on a throne of white marble, supported by twisted columns of greenish marble which once adorned the palace of the good Karim KMn at Shiraz. Another long passage, led to a garden, on the south side of which is a pavilion called the fitted up with mirrors and lustres, and open on one side. Here the Shah received the English Envoy, seated on the peacock throne of Delhi, and covered with jewels; and Ellis congratulated him on his acces sion. In August 1836 Sir Henry Ellis returned to England, 2 and was succeeded by Mr. McNeill, who had been many years in Persia, as Doctor to the Mission. Muhammad Shah was short and fat, with an aquiline 1 In November 1835, Sir Jolm N. R. Campbell, the former Envoy from the East India Company, left Tehran. He had been in charge of the Mission since June 1830, and was knighted in 18o2. He was formerly in the Madras Cavalry. By his assistance Muhammad Shah was placed on the throne, and he expended 78,000^. in equip ping his troops. 1 He was so generous and high-minded that, on more than one occasion, he bought up bad bills, given by stray English adventurers, in order that our national honour might not suffer.'— Colonel Stuart, 2 Sir Henry Ellis, who was in the East India Company's service, died in 1855.RUPTURE WITH HERAT. 475 nose and agreeable countenance ; but he was a man without abihty for governing, exceedingly fond of military display, and easily led by flattery. It was by means of his silly vanity and love of glory that he was led into aggressions against Herat; and the Eussians determined again to commence those intrigues which, while advancing their own schemes, have ever been so disastrous to Persia. Their instrument was a Dalmatian who had been taken prisoner when serving in the French army during the Moscow campaign, and afterwards entered the Kussian service. This was Count Simonich, who arrived at Tehran, as Minister to the Shah, in February 1833. He was a coarse looking stout man, with a limping gait, caused by a wound received from a Persian bullet, in the battle of Ganja. Count Simonich was instructed to encourage the Sh^h in his schemes of conquest, in the direction of Herat; and, in the first instance, there can be no doubt that the Persians had right on their side, as Shah KVimrAn, the Afghan ruler of Herat, had violated the territory of Khurasan, invaded Sistan, and otherwise failed to fulfil the treaty made with 'Abbas Mirza. But, afterwards, the ruler of Herat offered every reparation in his power ; and when the Shah, having refused all offers of accommodation, advanced to invade Herat, it was an act of unprovoked aggression prompted by the advice of Russia. England had always advised Persia to direct her attention to the amelioration of her internal condition, and dissuaded her from foreign conquest. It was the evident interest476 HISTORY OF PERSIA. of England that Persia should become a prosperous and powerful kingdom, and that she should not weaken her resources by useless foreign wars ; but Eussia had another game to play. That ambitious power knew that if the Shah was defeated, he would be weakened and at the mercy of his northern neighbour, and if successful he would be embroiled with England. In either case Kussia would be the gainer ; and her agents were instructed accordingly, but it was impossible for England to allow Herat,' the key of India,' to fall into the hands of a power whose councils were entirely guided by Eussia. 1 In November 1837, the Persian army, accompanied by the SMh in person, invaded the territory of Herat, and the vanguard under the Asafu-'d-Daulah captured Ghorian on the 15th. On the 22nd the siege of Herat commenced, but the Afghans bravely disputed every inch of ground, while the Persians were taking up their positions in the surrounding gardens and ruins. Kamran Shah, the ruler of Herat, was broken down by long years of debauchery, and, being usually drunk, he had resigned all real power into the hands of his minister. Kamran was cruel, ungrateful, short, un gainly and marked with the small-pox. His minister, Yar Muhammad Khan, was the nephew of Atta Muhammad, chief of the 'Aly-Khazy tribe, who had 1 But our interference was unfortunately a direct breach of tlie Ninth article of the Morier and Ellis Treaty (commonly called the Treaty of Tehran, and dated November 25, 1814), which pro vided :— 4 If there is war between Persia and the Afghans, England will not interfere, unless her mediation is solicited.'SIEGE OF HERAT. 477 been minister at Herat, to Hajji Firtiz. Yar Muhammad was stout, and of middle height, with thick negro lips, and overhanging brow. He was outwardly affable and courteous; but, in reality, the most avaricious un scrupulous miscreant in Central Asia, and utterly faithless and cruel. It happened that a young English officer, named Eldred Pottinger, 1 was in Herat when the Persians arrived before the city, having come there from Kabul, by the mountainous Hazarah country, and its gallant and successful defence must be attributed entirely to his energy and valour. For a long time communication was kept up with the country, and sorties were made every night. The greatest animosity prevailed; the Afghans sold all Persians to the Turkmans as slaves, and the Shah killed every Afghan prisoner. Colonel Stoddart was in the Persian camp; and the SMh had a Eussian detachment under General Samson, called 'deserters.' On April 6, 1838, Mr. McNeill arrived in camp, and remonstrated against the proceedings of the Shah. He declared that the invasion of Herat was a violation of the treaty, and that, there fore, Great Britain was at liberty to take measures to compel the withdrawal of the Persian army. All English officers serving in Persia had already been ordered to leave the country. Meanwhile the siege went on with increased activity. On April 21 Count Simonich, who had driven his carriage the whole way from Tehran to Herat, arrived 1 A lieutenant in the Bombay Artillery. He was sent by bis uncle Sir Henry Pottinger, then resident in Sind.478 HISTOEY OF PEESIA. in camp, and began to conduct the operations of the siege in person. Eussian influence was paramount, and every opportunity was taken to insult the English. One of Mr. McNeill's messengers had been stopped and insulted by the Persians in the previous October, but all reparation was refused, and on June 7, he left the camp. The besieged now began to be hard pressed, and their miseries increased every day. Still the siege was pushed forward under Eussian superintendence, and on June 24 a desperate assault was made. The walls of the city were, all four, a little less than a mile in length, and on the exterior slope of the embankment there •were two covered ways, or one within and one without the ditch. On the north side, the or citadel, overlooks the city. It is surrounded by a wet ditch, and is built of brick, with lofty ramparts and numerous towers. The mud walls of the town offered a passive resistance to the Persian fire; but in the fierce assault of the 24th of June, the place was well nigh lost. Yar Muhammad and Pottinger hastened to the scene of slaughter. The former lost heart, and had it not been for the gallant example of the young Englishman, the city would have been taken by assault. One desperate rally was made, and Herat was saved. But famine now stalked through the afflicted city. The poor died in the streets from want of food, and the rich were cruelly tortured by Yar Muhammad, for their money. The Government of India had, in the mean time, sent a small force, consisting of 387 Sepoys underSISGE OF HERAT 479 Colonel Sheriff into the Persian Gulf, who occupied the island of Karak on June 19,1838; and Mr. McNeill sent Colonel Stoddart to the Shah's camp, informing him that unless he desisted from his attack on Herat, the British expedition would proceed to further acts of hostility. Colonel Stoddart arrived at the camp on August 11. This slight demonstration had the desired effect. The warlike Shah was terrified at the arrival of a few Sepoys on an island thirty miles from the coast of Persia; and on September 9, the Persian army began to retreat from before Herat. Pottinger declared that the Shah might have taken the place in twenty-four hours after his arrival, if the army had been properly commanded. Simonich advanced a large sum of money, and promised that if the Sh&amp;h took Herat, the balance of the Russian debt should be remitted. But the Eussian Government did not confine its schemes to Herat. An emissary named Captain Vicovitch, who had been aide-de-camp to the Governor of Orenburgh, was sent to intrigue against British interests at Kandahar and Kabul. Yet when the English Ambassador at St. Petersburg!! remonstrated with Prince Kesselrode, that wily states man, as it did not then suit the plans of Russia to quarrel with England, coolly denied the acts of the Russian agents. Simonich was superseded by Count Meden in 1839 ; and poor Vicovitch, who was of less consequence, was entirely ignored^ The wretched man, thus disowned by his own Government, committed suicide. The Russians, however, by leading Persia480 HISTORY OF PERSIA. into a ruinous war, and estranging her from England, gained the end they had in view, and subsequently seized upon the coveted bit of Persian territory, with out opposition. At this time the English Government embarked on that gigantic blunder, the invasion of Afghanistan. Alarmed at the intrigues of Eussia, and at her influence over the councils of Persia, the Government, instead of cultivating the friendship of the ruler of Klbul, Dost Muhammad, conceived the idea of placing a puppet of their own, in the shape of Shah Shuja', the Ludiana pensioner, on the throne. The principal statesmen in England who were ac quainted with Eastern affairs, the late Duke of Welling ton, Lord Wellesley, Mounstuart Elphinstone, and Sir C. Metcalfe, emphatically disapproved of the measure. But in September 1839 Kabul and Kandahar were occupied, and Lord Auckland was made an Earl. In 1842, after suffering one of the most terrible disasters that ever befell the English arms, their tarnished honour was restored by the glorious operations of Nott and Pollock ; and we retired from the scenes of our unjust invasion with credit. Dost Muhammad was restored to his government, and retained it to the day of his death. When peril surrounded the English in 1857, he administered a fitting rebuke and took a noble revenge, by remaining faithful to his alliance with Great Britain. When the siege of Herat was raised by the Persians, in 1839, every effort was made by Stoddart and Pottinger to save the inhabitants from starving : 600 orENGLISH AT HERAT. 481 700 of them were fed daily by Pottinger, on millet boiled up with the fat from sheep's tails, and a little salt: and a monthly sum was paid, by order of Lord Auckland, to support Kamran and his chiefs, and to restore the defences. Major Todd was sent on a mission 1 to negotiate a treaty of alliance, by which the independence of Herat was to be guaranteed, on condition that the slave trade was abolished. This arrangement was completed in August 1839. The people were exempted from taxes till after the harvest of 1840, and a monthly allowance was granted by the Governor General, for the support of the state. The exertions of the English officers to prevent Yar Muhammad from selling the wretched people to the Turkmans excited his ferocious enmity. British honour and Asiatic cruelty and treachery could have no real sympathy, but the tyrant concealed his hatred that he might continue in the receipt of English gold. Two months after the siege Colonel Stoddart left Herat for Bukhara ; and in August 1839, Eldred Pottinger 2 also left Herat, after having endured the gross insults and vile ingratitude of Yar Muhammad. The treacherous miscreant wrote to the Persian Government that ' he merely tolerated the English Envoy from expediency, but that his hopes were in the Asylum of Islam ;' and he continued to intrigue with 1 The mission to Herat consisted of the following officers;— Major Todd Lieut.

Persia, after receiving 190,000/!. from tlie British Government. At last his insolence and treachery became intolerable, and Major Todd 1 withdrew the mission from Herat in September 1840. During the British occupation of Afghanistan several efforts were made by English officers to mitigate the slave trade and explore Central Asia. Lieutenant Wyburd of the Indian Navy had in June 1835 been sent to Khiva by Sir John Campbell, and his fate long remained a mystery. After the siege of Herat, Colonel Stoddart penetrated to Bukhara; and, in December 1838 was cast into a loathsome prison by the Amir who then governed the country. In 1840 Lieuts. Abbott and Shakespear, at different times, visited Khiva, and succeeded in liberating many Eussian slaves, and bringing them safely to Orenburgh. In November 1840 Lieutenant Conolly reached Khiva, travelled thence to Kokan, and eventually proceeded to Bukhara, to attempt the liberation of Colonel Stoddart. In March and June 1841 Sir William Macnaghten received letters from Stoddart, but after wards both the officers were cast into prison, and mur dered. In February 1844 Dr. Wolff started for Bukhara, and arrived there on April 27, in company with Dil Hasan Khan an envoy from the Governor of Khurasan. He ascertained the fate of the unfortunate officers but too surely; they had been foully murdered by the 1 Todd's proceedings at Herat were disapproved of by Lord Auck land. He was remanded to his regiment, and was killed at the hat tie of 'PiriizshASHtjRADA. 483 Amir in July 1841; and Wyburd, after being confined in a dungeon for many years, had also been murdered. Dr. Wolff left BukMra on May 21, 1844, and arrived safely from his adventurous and perilous enterprise. The differences between Persia and England were, after much negotiation, brought to an amicable termi nation : the English evacuated the island of Karak in March 1842; and Colonel Sheil, Mr. McNeill's suc cessor, after a long residence at Erzerum, arrived at Tehran as British minister in August 1842. But the Eussians had already taken advantage of the exhausted state of Persia, consequent on her exertions to capture Herat. The Northern Turan had played a deep and a winning game. The coveted prize was an island close to the Persian shores of the Caspian. The island of Ashurada is about twelve miles from the coast nearest to Astrabad, and situated in the bay which takes its name from the Persian city. It is about a mile and a half long, and less than a mile broad, with a sandy surface. It has fresh-water springs, and the water is deep close to the beach. In 1841 two Eussian vessels of war arrived at the island of Ashurada, with the ostensible purpose of repressing the piratical incursions of the Turkmans, but really with the intention of committing an unpro voked act of aggression on a weak ally, and of forming a permanent settlement. The remonstrances of Persia were answered by accusations of ingratitude, and com plete possession was taken of the island. It is now covered with Eussian houses, hospitals, barracks, and 11 2484 HISTORY OF PERSIA. gardens; and no Turkman or Persian boat is allowed to move without a Kussian passport. 1 The position of Ashftrada is most important for the development of the further schemes of Eussian aggression, as it brings the northern invaders several hundred miles (the whole length of the Caspian) nearer to India. On the coast, opposite to Ashurada, the river Gur- g^n empties itself into the sea, which is navigable for small steamers, for many miles in the direction of Mash-had. Along the course of this river, from Astrabad to Deregez (within 120 miles of Mash-had), there is a level plain, covered with rich pasture, where numerous flocks of sheep and herds of oxen feed, and capable of producing corn. Coal is abundant at Tejer Tash, 24 miles north of Shahrud, and at Eamian, 50 miles east of Astrabad. These facts prove the great importance of Ashurada, as a point whence the Eussians may, at some future day, invade KhurMn and Herat, and threaten our Indian Empire. After the settlement of the differences with England, the attention of the Persian Government was turned to the Turkish frontier, where the greatest disorder prevailed amongst the wild Kurdish tribes. The Per sian and Turkish Kurds kept up a constant warfare, travellers were murdered, villages plundered, and a deplorable state of things had continued to exist for a length of time. The exact boundary had never been determined, and the Turkish and Persian Governments requested England and Eussia to assist them in deciding the 1 Sir Justin Sheil, note D, p. 346-7.TUKCO-PERSIAN FRONTIER. 485 question, and in drawing up a treaty of peace. A commission assembled at Erzerum in ] 843, in which England was represented by Colonel Williams (now Sir William Williams of Kars), Major Farrant, and Mr. Curzon, and the Treaty of Erzerum was signed between Persia and Turkey on May 31, 1847, for the settlement of the boundary dispute. In May 1849 the Boundary Commissioners again met at Baghdad; and in 1851 they met at Muhammarah, Captain Glascott, E.N., being the English surveyor. The survey was continued jointly by the Eussians and English until 1853, when the Crimean war broke out. The country surveyed. commences near Mount Ararat, and termi nates at the head of the Persian Gulf, a distance of nearly 700 miles, with a width of 20 to 40 miles, over the wild and difficult tract comprising the Kurdish mountains. The resulting map was divided into 21 sections, on a scale of one inch to a mile, and was completed by Captain Glascott in 1865. It does not lay down the boundary, but only represents a strip of country within which it had been agreed that the boundary should finally be fixed. Two copies were presented to the Turkish and Persian Govern ments in 1869 ; and it has been agreed that, until the actual frontier line is settled, the status quo shall be maintained. Soon after the Boundary Commissioners met at Erzerum in 1843, a terrible catastrophe overtook the Persian pilgrims at Kerbela, who were accustomed to flock, in thousands, with their dead, to the holy shrine of Hasan.486 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Kerbela is about 55 miles south-south-west of Bagh- dM, on the banks of the Euphrates. The town is nearly two miles round, and surrounded by a brick wall, 24 feet high. The tomb of Hasan in the centre of the city, and of his brother 'Abbas in the south-east quarter, are the chief buildings, but the streets are very narrow, and the houses mostly belong to Persians. The population is about 20,000, but always fluctuating. Kerbela is surrounded by gardens close up to the walls, and clumps of huge date-trees. The Persians in Kerbela had, for years, nearly thrown off the authority of the SuMn, and two Turkish Governors had been murdered. At length Namak P^sha of Baghdad determined to enforce obedience to the Sultan, and sent a force against the town under Abu-'l-Abftt Pasha, who pitched his camp in a grove of palms; and demanded the payment of arrears of tribute. This was insolently refused, and in January 1843 the Turks took Kerbela by storm. A horrible massacre followed, 3,000 Persians were killed, and a Kajar princess, daughter of the Firman-firma, was wounded. At first the Persian Government breathed nothing but war and vengeance for this sacrilegious outrage, but eventually things were explained away, and the difference was made up. During the latter years* of the reign of Muhammad Shah, he passed his time in sitting at a window, and shooting at sparrows with a pistol. Hajji Mirza Aghasy, the half crazy old Prime Minister, had the whole administration in his hands, and obtained com plete control over the Shah.

At Tehran the influence of Eussia was in the as cendant, the Hajji openly declared himself a Eussian subject, and Count Meden was succeeded as Eussian minister by Prince Dolgorouki, who arrived at Tehran in January 1846. The condition of the provinces was deplorable ; and every man with any pretension to talent or patriotism was driven into exile by the old Hajji, who was sedulously collecting wealth for himself at Tehran, at the expense of the wretched country. The governor ships of provinces were sold to the highest bidders, who oppressed the people in a fearful manner. Kirmanshah, in 1846, was bought by one Mauhib 'Aly Khan* who seized upon all the flocks and herds, and left the people to starve. Men and women might be seen lying in the streets, at the last gasp of starva tion. Tr&amp;k had been governed since 1839 by Menucheher Khan, the Mu'tamu-'d-Daulah, who obtained the ap pointment through Eussian influence. On one occa sion he was driven out of Isfahan, by the people, for cruelty and oppression ; but he was a man of energy and courage, and in 1841 completely crushed the Bakhtiyari tribes, which had risen in rebellion. His vigorous though severe administration secured to the people of Isfahan some little justice; but he died in May 1848. Azerbaijan was, for several years, governed by Bahram Mirza, the Shah's brother; but he excited the iJ 1' ' riitl 11 ■ ; 111 P P Lplllj I488 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. jealousy of the Hajji, and was banished. He was a man of considerable ability, and has ever since lived in Georgia, on a Russian pension. But the most melancholy fate was that of the powerful Asafu-'d-Daulah, who had been governor of Khur&amp;s&amp;n since the accession of Muhammad. He was a man of great ability, of a naturally good dis position, but proud and haughty. European strangers were always treated by him with kindness and hos pitality when they visited Khurasan. M. Ferrier was received by him in an upper chamber at Nishapur, looking upon a large garden full of roses, the perfume of which scented the atmosphere. He was simply dressed in a woollen robe and a sheep-skin cap, and his intelligent countenance preserved all the freshness and vivacity of youth. He received him with great kindness, and forwarded the objects of his journey. Dr. Wolff, also, received cordial assistance from him; and he displayed much interest in the fate of Stoddart and Conolly, sending an envoy to Bukhara at his own expense. 1 His son, the S&amp;lar, or General, a title given him by the old Shah, Fat-h 'Aly, is described by Colonel Stuart as one of the handsomest men he ever saw. The S414r usually commanded his father's troops. But the mild and beneficent rule of the Asafu-'d- Daulah, in Khurasan was brought to a sudden close by the jealousy of old Hajji Mirza Aghasy. He was 1 General Monteith told me that the Asafu-'d-Daulah was a nasty, mean, wretched fellow, remarkable only for his excessive con ceit, and without any capacity for governing.490 HISTORY OF PERSIA. recalled to Tehran in March 1847, and sent on a forced pilgrimage to Mekkah. In vain his sister, the SMh's mother, interceded, and declared her intention of going with him. The influence of the minister prevailed ; and the Prince was ruined, and driven from his country, never to return. The SM&amp;r was left in the government of KhurMn; but the province fell into disorder, and Ja'afar Kuly KMn, the powerful Chief of Biijnurd, rose in revolt. Such was the miserable state to which Persia had been reduced by the imbecility of the fat weak-minded SMh ; the rapacity and incapacity of his minister Hajji Mirza Aghasy; and the intrigues of Eussia. Muhammad Sh^lh died on September 4, 1848, at Tehran, and was buried at Kum. He was succeeded by Msru-'d-Din, the present Shah of Persia. 1 1 At the time of Muhammad Shah's death, Colonel Shell was in England, having gone on leave in October 184:7. Colonel Farrant was left in charge of the British Mission.491 CHAPTER XX. THE KAJAE DYNASTY. Reign of Ndsru- d-D On the death of Muhammad Shah, his wretched old minister, Hajji Mirza Aghasy, ■went to the palace of Tehran with 1,200 followers and shut the gates; declaring that he was a harmless old man, and only wished to pass the remainder of his days in peace. In reality, he dreaded the loss of his ill-gotten riches. Nasru-'d-Din, the new Shah, was at Tabriz ; and, in Mirza Taky, the Commander of the forces, he had an invaluable supporter. This extraordinary man was the son of Bahrain Mirza's cook, and had been brought up and educated with the Prince's children. In process of time he became Waziru-'n-Nizam, Adjutant General of the forces, in Azerbaijan, and amassed great wealth. In 1845, he was sent to Erzerum, to represent Persia in the Boundary Commission, and signed a treaty between Persia and Turkey in June 1847. On the death of the old Amiru-'n-Nizam,' Commander-in-chief,' he returned to Tabriz, and succeeded to his office. Mirza Taky, the new Amiru-'n-Nizam, marched the army from Tabriz to Tehran, and seated N&amp;sru-'d-Dln on the throne ; who gave him his sister in marriage.492 history of persia. and made him Prime Minister, but he retained the title of Amiru-'n-Nizam. Old Hajji Mirza Aghasy relieved Persia of his pre sence, and retired to Kerbela, where he died in 1850. Nasru-'d-Din Shah entered Tehran on October 20, 1848, and succeeded as the fourth Shah of the Kajar dynasty. Colonel Stuart, who saw him when quite a little boy in 1835, at Diran, a village surrounded by extensive orchards, near the lake of Urumiyyah, says : ' I never saw so beautiful a child; the expression of his countenance is mournful, and the poor thing is evi dently shy.' His minister, the Amiru-'n-Nizam, took the whole administration into his hands, and exerted him self to repair the disorders which had resulted from the misgovernment of the Hajji. He improved the army and the finances, and evidently had the good of his country at heart; but he committed the great mistake of degrading the young Shah to a mere cipher. Colonel Sheil, the English minister, who had been on leave, returned to Tehran in November 1849. The tyranny and oppression of the late reign pro duced their fruit in disorders and insurrections in several provinces. In 1850 a bloody rebellion broke out at Isfahan, which was not put down without much fighting. But the most alarming rebellion was in Khur4s&amp;n, consequent on the unjust treatment of the once powerful Asafu-'d-Daulah, whose family had been reduced to poverty by the confiscations of the late Shah and his minister. In May 1848 his son, the SaMr, who had taken refuge with the Turkmans on his father's disgrace.SIEGE OF MXSH-HAD. 493 raised the standard of revolt, and was joined by Ja'afar Kuly KMn, the Chief of Btijnftrd. The Salar seized upon Mash-had, which was besieged by a Persian army under Mftrad Mirza. 1 Up to February 1850, the siege made little progress ; the place was not entirely invested, and the citizens made frequent successful sorties. Muhammad 'Aly Khan, the Solar's brother, who had passed through the whole of Persia in the disguise of a pilgrim, arrived at Mash-had in February with supplies and money. But in April 1850, the gates were opened by a traitor named 'AbMs KMy Khan, and the Shah's troops took possession of the holy city. The Salar and his brother were put to death, the former being previously tortured, and another brother was poisoned at Tehran. Thus a blood-feud was created between the Shah's family and the senior branch of the Kajar tribe; and the great and important services of the noble old Asafu- 'd-Daulah were rewarded by the confiscation of his property and the slaughter of his children. Ja'afar Kfily Khan of Bujnurd made his peace with the Government, and was appointed Governor of Astrabad. Prince Murad Mirza, in 1851, became Governor of Khurasan. The Eussians at Ashurada were suspected, not with out reason, of having intrigued with Ja'afar Kuly, and fostered the rebellion in Khurasan : and, in 1851 they 1 Colonel Stuart, in 1833,. says, ' It was great fun to see the swagger of Sultan Mtirad Mirza (Muhammad Shah's brother), a little prince twelve years old, when he came on parade in his red coat and gold epaulettes, to drill a regiment lately raised at Tabriz, in the Maidan.'—p. 231.494 HISTORY OF PERSIA. enacted the fable of the wolf and the lamb with such bare-faced coolness, that it excited the mirth even of their Persian victims. They had long imposed vexations restrictions on the movements of the Turkmans of the opposite shore, and at length they were taken off their guard by their watchful neighbours. It is the custom of Muscovites to get very drunk on Easter night, as some consolation for the long previous fast. The Yamftt Turkmans were aware of this little weakness, and landed on the island of Ashurada under cover of the night. They made a sudden onslaught on the drowsy guards, put several to death, and carried away about twenty to be sold as slaves, returning safely to the mainland. Meanwhile, the war steamer in the harbour, whose crew were also far gone, made no attempt to rescue the people on shore, but steamed about firing her guns without any object. The Persians said she, too, was evidently as drunk as the crew. In short, there was a regular panic, and the Turkman foray was completely suc cessful. Then came the fable of the wolf and the lamb. Prince Dolgorouki, the Russian minister in Persia, had the assurance to demand redress for this disgraceful affair from the Shah's Government; though the Rus sians had unjustly deprived the Persians of the right of navigating the Caspian, and the Turkmans were not their subjects. The demand was too outrageous to be enforced, and, after some altercation, it fell to the ground. The commencement of the reign of Nasru -'d-DinTHE BABYS. 495 SMh was disturbed by the rise of a new fanatical sect. Its founder, the Seyyid 'Aly Muhammad, who took the name of Bab (Arabic for 4 a gate '), was born at Shiraz, in 1810, the son of a merchant. He first divulged his pretensions to being a prophet near Baghdad, after passing several years in religious seclusion. Many people of all ranks in Persia became his followers, but he was eventually shot at Tabriz. His doctrines were composed of Pantheism and the wildest Socialist principles, and his morals resembled those of Hasan Sabah, the founder of the Assassins. The great numbers of mullahs and educated men in all parts of Persia, who joined this wild sect, proves how loosely the Muhammadan faith now hangs on the modern Persians, and how easily any accident might shake Islam, and make it totter to its fall. In Mazandaran, Pars, Kirman, and Trak many hundreds of Babls were killed. They died fighting to the last, and bravely enduring the most cruel tortures. In Zerjan, a town 200 miles from Tehran, on the road to Tabriz, the Baby religious movement broke out with great violence in 1851. For months the Babis sustained a siege against the forces of the Shah; and, when the place was stormed, they fought from house to house until all were killed, the wounded being bayoneted in cold blood. From that time the Babls have been obliged to conceal their creed, but their numbers are still increasing. Soon afterwards they made an attempt to assassinate the Shah, when going out huntings which failed. The conspirators were tortured in the most barbarous way, holes were dug in their bodies into496 HISTORY OP PERSIA. which lighted candles were stuck, and finally they were divided amongst the different public offices, to be put to death. But Babiism is not extinct, and these atrocities will only add to the fury of the religious zeal of the fanatics. In 1851 Amiru-'n-Nizam, one of the most able ministers that Persia has known in modern times, was disgraced and foully murdered. The Shah had become jealous of his power, and he was hated by the courtiers for his integrity, and attempts at economy. In November 1851 he was dispossessed of all his offices, and sent as a prisoner to Kashan. His young wife, the Shah's sister, who was only seventeen and very pretty, insisted on accompanying her fallen husband, and proved, by her noble and generous conduct, that conjugal love exists amongst Persian ladies. The Amiru-'n-Nizam was several months in confinement, during which time his wife always tasted his food first, to guard against poison. On January 9, 1852, the Farrash-ljaslii,' Steward of the Household, was sent by the Shah, with a party of assassins, to murder the man who had placed him on the throne. He accomplished his purpose by treachery, sending to tell the Princess that the Shah had relented, that her husband was at liberty to retire to Kerbela, and that he might safely come out and enjoy a bath. On hearing the joyful news the poor Amku-'n-Nizam left the Princess s apartments, and she never saw him again. He made a desperate resistance, but was overpowered and murdered by the Parrash-Bashi, and his vile crew. All Tehran was struck with horror at this foul deed ; his. MUEDEE OF THE AMIRU-'N-NIZAM. 497 ^ faults were forgotten, and his ability, his patriotism, and desire for the welfare of Persia were alone remembered. 1 Thus did the Eajar Shah, after the manner of his ancestors, 2 reward the services of the man who had placed him on the throne, by foully murdering him. The Amiru-'n-Nizdm was succeeded in the office of Prime Minister by a Persian courtier named Mirza igha Khan, who had formerly enjoyed the title of I timadu- d-Daulah, and had been under the protection of the British Mission. In November 1851 he re ceived his appointment from the Shah, and assumed the title of Sadr-A'zam c first in precedence,' the usual title of the Prime Minister under the Shahs of the Kajar dynasty. The Sadr-Azam was a man of considerable ability, of long experience in court intrigue, and kept his place by clever and assiduous flattery of the Shah, who never heard the truth, and was kept profoundly ignorant of the real state of the country; but the Sadr-A'zam, like most Persian cour tiers, was utterly faithless, without any honourable feeling, and, when he dared, was inclined to be haughty and insolent. The welfare of his country was quite a secondary consideration when compared with his own interests. Such is the man, in whose hands the government of Persia continued for seven years. 1 Mr. Watson, in his History of Persia, p. 864, writes in the highest terms of the Amiru-'n-Nizam. 2 The Kajar SMhs have always celebrated their accessions by murdering the faithful followers to whom they owed their crowns. Fat-h 'Aly assassinated Hajji Ibrahim, Muhammad assassinated the Kaim-Makam, and Nasru-'d-Din assassinated the Amiru-'n-Nizam. K K498 HISTORY OP PERSIA. Soon after the entry of the Sadr-A'zam into power, the ambitious designs of the Persian Government were once more turned towards Herat. In 1844, Yar Muhammad had murdered old Kam- rlin, banished all the Sadozai Princes, his relations, and seized upon the supreme power at Herat. From that time he had paid assiduous court to the Persian Government, and thus continued in possession of his ill-gotten power. Yar Muhammad died on June 8, 1851, and was succeeded by his son Syd Muhammad KMn. The new ruler is described by Mr. Ferrier, who saw him in 1845, as a handsome young fellow of about twenty, with agreeable manners, but he was a miserable drunkard, and placed himself entirely in the hands of Persia. He sent several Heraty nobles as prisoners to Mash-had, and even condescended to accept his appoint ment of Governor of Herat from the Shah. He had, in fact, ceased to be an independent prince; and the Persians only waited for a pretext to seize upon the city itself. This was afforded in the advance of Kohun-dil-KMn, the Barakzai Chief of Kandahar to Farrah. On pre tence of repelling this invasion, 'Abbas Kuly, the traitor of Mash-had, 1 marched towards Herat, and in April 1852, he occupied the citadel without oppo sition, leaving a Persian force at Ghorian. He was soon afterwards reinforced by Sim KMn, Ilkhany of Dereghez, a chief of great notoriety in Khurasan; and 1 See page 493.AGREEMENT KESPECTINO HEEAT. 499 though Sam Khan was recalled in January 1853, 'Abbas Kuly still remained as wazir to Syd Muhammad, receiving his appointment from the Shah. These proceedings of the Persians, in taking advan tage of the dissolute wretch who ruled Herat, and oc cupying that city, obliged Colonel Sheil to remonstrate in strong terms with the Sadr-A'zam, and even to ac company his remonstrances with threats. These latter had the desired effect; and on January 25, 1853, an engagement was contracted and signed by the Persian Government respecting Herat. By this engagement they agreed to send no Persian troops to Herat; not to interfere with its internal affairs; to abandon the demand for coinage, and the KMtbah (or ' prayer'), to be said in the Shah's name ; not to have a permanent agent there; and to set at liberty all Heraty Khans now at Tehran or Mash-had. 'Abbas Kuly was therefore recalled. This was the last political act of Colonel Sheil. 1 In February, 1853, he resigned his appointment, and returned to England, leaving the secretary, Mr. Taylor Thompson, in charge of the Mission. The Persian Government being thus, for a time, obliged to relinquish their designs on Herat, prepared 1 Sir Justin Sheil, K.C.B., first came to Persia in 1834, and was employed for some years in disciplining the regiments of Azer baijan.

In 1856 Lady Sheil published Glimpses of Life and Manners in Persia^ a charming work, to which Sir Justin added some valuable notes.500 HISTORY OP PERSIA. to attack the Turkmans of Merv. 'Abbas Kuly, who had returned from Herat in May 1853, was made Governor of Merv, and died there. In August, the Khivans besieged the Persian army at Merv; and in May 1854, they were obliged to retreat. In March 1855, the Khan of Khiva was surprised near Sarakhs, and killed by a Turkm&amp;n chief. The incur sions and depredations of the wild hordes into KhurMn continued to be as disastrous and frequent as ever. In 1855 there was a sudden change in the govern ment of Herat, which led to very important conse quences. Prince Muhammad Yusuf, a Sadozai prince, a grandson of Hajji Firuz, the former ruler of Herat, was, by education and character, far superior to any other prince of the Sadoz&amp;i race. 1 He was much respected at Herat, and on very friendly terms with the officers of Major Todd's Mission in 1839 ; but on the murder of his relation Kamran in 1844, he had been forced to seek safety in Persia, from the enmity of Yar Muhammad Khan. He had resided for several years at Mash-had ; and in October 1851, was appointed to command a body of irregular cavalry at Serjam, 1 Ahmed 'Abdallah Shah Durany. (SMozdi.) Timur.

In that year he had been invited by several chiefs, who detested the vicious rule of Syd Muhammad, to come to Herat; but things were not then ready. In September 1855, however, he was again invited; and, reaching Herat in safety, he seized the government, and put Syd Muhammad to death, with a number of his followers of the 'Aly-Khazy tribe, who were suspected of being accomplices in the murder of old Prince Kamriln. The Persians appear to have approved of Muhammad Yusufs accession, as they believed that he would be a useful and subservient instrument in furthering their ambitious designs. The young SMh, like his father, was full of schemes of aggrandizement in the direction of Afghanistan; and he was encouraged by the flattery of the Sadr-A'zam. An excuse for the invasion of Herat was soon found. Kohun-dil-KMn, the ruler of Kandahar, died in the autumn of 1855; and, in October his brother Dost Muhammad, the Amir of K&amp;bul, marched to Kandahar, and annexed it to his dominions. The discontented sons and nephews of Kohun-di 1-KMn fled to Tehran, and the Persian Government declared that Dost Muhammad intended to invade Herat, and threaten Kurasan. Prince Murad Mirza, on pretence of resisting an Afghan invasion, was ordered to advance with a Persian army, and occupy the city, in March 1856. Previous to these transactions, the Hon. C. A. Mur ray arrived as British Minister at Tehran in April 1855.502 HISTORY OF PERSIA. He was followed by M. Bouree, at the head of a French mission. Prince Dolgoronki had been superseded by M. Anitchkoff in September 1854. Sir Charles Murray, 1 a most entertaining author, had been for some time Consul-General in Egypt; and his great talent, extensive information, and facility of acquiring languages, well fitted him for his difficult and harassing post. But the Persian Government had entered upon a career of aggression in the direction of Herat, in defiance of the agreement with Colonel Sheil, and with a full knowledge that England would disap prove of the conquest of that important city. The Sadr-A'zim, bent only on flattering the vanity of the Shah, not only turned a deaf ear to the just remon strances of Mr. Murray, but took every opportunity of insulting and annoying the British Mission. The treatment practised on Mr. McNeill was repeated in Mr. Murray's case. Every kind of petty annoyance was heaped upon him by this truculent and semi- 1 Mr. Murray, now Sir Charles, is second son of the fifth Earl of Dunmore, by Susan, daughter of the ninth Duke of Hamilton.

Persons under British protec tion were thrown into prison, personal and slanderous attacks were made upon the minister himself, all redress was refused ; and, at length, longer endurance becoming impossible, Mr. Murray hauled down his flag in December 1855, and retired to Baghdad. But Prince Muhammad Yusuf did not prove so com plete a tool as the Persian Government had expected, and even if he had been inclined to further their views, he would have been prevented by the people of Herat, headed by Isan Khan, an energetic chief of the 'Aly- Khazy tribe of Afghans. The first Persian detachment, under Sam Khan, was refused admittance, and Isan Khan informed that chief that the Heratys would resist the entrance of the Persians. Prince Murad Mirza, on hearing this, halted at Turbat-i-Jami; but he received peremptory orders from Tehran to advance, and accordingly, after de feating the Heratys at Ghorian, he regularly besieged the city, in the beginning of April 1856. The Afghans made a most gallant defence, but there was no English officer—no Pottinger to conduct it, and the place eventually fell. The defence was at first conducted jointly by Prince Muhammad Yfisuf and Isan Khan; but the former, having made an unsuccessful effort to imprison the Afghan chief, whose growing power he dreaded, Isan Khan seized the unfortunate prince, and sent him a prisoner into the Persian camp. He was forwarded to Tehran, where he was treated as a rebel, and many insults were heaped upon him by the Shah.504 HISTORY OF PERSIA. Murad Mirza had a besieging force of 30,000 men, and the operations were conducted by a Frenchman named Buhler; yet for several months the assaults were repulsed, and the besiegers were harassed by hordes of Turkmans from Merv and Sarakhs. On August 30, though the Heratys were suffering severely from scarcity of provisions, the Persians were repulsed with great loss from the walls, by Mn Khan. The Heratys had twelve 12-pounders, well mounted, and the shot of the Persians lodged harmless in the solid mud walls of the city. The Persian General could never have taken the place by force, his officers were cowards, and the besieged were fighting with heroic bravery ; but famine did its work, and on October 26, 1856, the Persians took possession of Herat. Their loss during the siege was 1,800 men, that of the Heratys 1,500, and the gallant Is&amp;n Khan was mur dered after the surrender. The Shah declared Herat to be a part of his dominions. It was impossible for England to allow the SMh to take permanent possession of the most important place in Central Asia—' the key of India,'—in defiance of an engagement ratified by himself; and it was abso lutely necessary that an apology and reparation should be made for the gross insults that had been offered to Mr. Murray. Our demands formed the basis of a nego tiation at Constantinople between Lord Stratford de Eedcliffe and Farukh Khan, the Persian envoy about to proceed to Paris; but it failed, and the Persian sailed for Prance. On November 1, 1856, the Governor-General ofWAR WITH ENGLAND. 505 India declared war with Persia, for having broken her engagement with Colonel Sheil, and seized upon the city of Herat. An expedition sailed from Bombay, and occupied the island of Karak on December 4, 1856, without opposition. On the 7th the troops, under General Stalker, were landed at Halilah Bay, near Bushire, and the position of the Persians, in the ruined fort of Eeshir, near the sea, was carried after two hours' hard fighting, on the 9th. The Persians retreated into the town of Bushire; and when the English troops had advanced to within a thousand yards of the walls, the Governor hauled down his flag, and surrendered. But in the meanwhile the fleet had been bombarding the town for nearly four hours. 59 guns, 300 muskets, and large stores of ammunition were cap tured. On January 27, 1857, General Sir J. Outram arrived at Bushire to take command of the English forces. The Persian general, Shujau-'l-Mulk, had formed an intrenched camp at the village of Burazjan, 46 miles from Bushire, and 12 from the feet of the mountains which separate the sandy coast from the table-land of Persia. He had an army of 5,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 18 guns, with excellent artillery men. On February 3 Outram marched out of Bushire, to dislodge him, with 419 native cavalry, 2,022 native and 2,212 European infantry, and 18 guns. The force was without tents or extra clothing of any sort, each man carrying his great coat, blanket, and two days' cooked provisions.506 history of persia. After a march of 46 miles in 41 hours, in cold nights and deluging storms of rain, they reached the enemy's intrenched position on the morning of the 5th, and found it abandoned, all the camp equipage and ordnance magazines being left behind. Outram commenced his return march to Bushire on the 7th; and was followed by the Persian army, which, at daybreak on the 8th, was discovered in his rear, drawn up in order of battle 7,000 strong, near the little village of Kush-ab. The British troops at once moved to the attack, their artillery doing great execution. The 3rd Light Cavalry charged a Persian square, broke it, and killed nearly every man in the regiment. On the cavalry and artillery fell the whole brunt of the action, and by 10 a.m . the defeat of the Persians was complete. They fled in a disorganised state, leaving 700 men dead, and two guns on the field of battle. The English bivouacked on the night of the 8th, near Kush-ab, 1 and returned the following day to Bushire. General Outram, having thus secured the safety of Bushire, prepared to strike a blow at the most vulner able point of Persia. The important province of Khuzistan (or Arabistan) is watered by the river Karun, which falls into the Shattu-'l-'Arab, as the Euphrates and Tigris are called from their junction to the Persian Gulf. This river is navigable for small steamers as far as Shuster, the capital of Khuzis tan, and the Persians had occupied the seaport of 1 Kush-db means 1 sweet-water.'WAR WITH ENGLAND. 507 Muhammerah, at its mouth.' The sea-eoast of this pro vince is inhabited by turbulent tribes of Cha'ab Arabs; in number about 27,300; and the mountains above Shuster are the homes of almost independent Bakhtiyaris. Shuster is 300 miles from Shiraz, 260 to Kirmanshah, and only about seven days' journey to Isfahan. It is clear that the conquest of this province would threaten the very heart of the Persian Empire : and the restless Bakhtiyaris and Cha'ab Arabs were quite ready to assist the English against their Persian masters. The Persians had erected strong earth batteries on either side of the mouth of the Karfin, completely commanding the passage, and very skilfully placed. The banks, for many miles, are covered with date groves, and the opposite shore of the Shattu-'l-'Arab was Turkish territory, and therefore not available for counter-batteries. The Persian army amounted to 13,000 men, and 30 guns, in a camp at Muham merah, commanded by Prince EMlar Mlrza. On March 18, Sir J. Outram left Busliire, with 392 horse, 1,534 European and 2,385 native infantry, 342 artillery and twelve guns—total 4,886 men ; with four armed steamers, and two sloops of war. On the 26th the mortars on a raft, and the steamers, opened fire on the batteries at the mouth of the Kardn, while the troops were landed under General Havelock. They advanced through a date grove, and across a plain, towards the intrenched camp of the Persians; but the Kdjar Prince, exhibited the most disgraceful cowardice, and fied precipitately without striking a blow, leaving tents, baggage, stores, and sixteen guns behind him.508 HISTORY OF PEESIA. On the 29tli an expedition under Captain Eennie, of the Indian Navy, was sent up the Karftn, in search of the Persian fugitive army, 13,000 strong. His force consisted of three river steamers, three gun-boats, and three ships' cutters, with 300 men of the sixty-forth and seventy-eighth regiments. On April 1, they ap proached Ahwaz, about half-way between Shuster and MuMmmerah, where the Persian army was encamped. 300 men landed, and the whole Persian force fled in confusion before this handful of British troops, their rear not being 1,200 yards from them. Ahwaz was occupied by Captain Eennie, and great stores of grain for the army were distributed by him amongst the people. Captain Hunt, of the seventy-eighth High landers, commanded the military detachment. The expedition returned to Muhammerah on the 4th; and on the 5th of April Sir J. Outram received the news of the signature of the Treaty of Peace between Persia and England. Khaular Mirza's army was thoroughly disorganized ; and in a few days Outram might easily have con quered the whole province of Khuzistan. The treaty of peace, which suddenly put a stop to these successful operations, had been negotiated between Lord Cowley and Farukh Khan, at Paris, and was signed on March 4, 1857. By this treaty the SMh engaged to withdraw his troops from Herat, to relinquish all claims to sovereignty over it, and never to demand any marks of obedience, such as the coinage, or ' Khutbah,' 1 from the chiefs. 1 Khutbah, 1 prayer for the king/EFFECTS OF THE WAE. 511 Mr. Murray returned to Tehran on July 18, 1857, and, the stipulated ceremonies and apologies from the Sadr-'Azam having been duly gone through, friendly relations were resumed between Persia and England. Murad Mirza and all the Persian troops evacuated Herat; the English forces at Bushire and Karak, under General Jacob, were ordered to return to Bombay; 1 and Colonel Taylor accompanied by Captain Claud Clerk was sent on an Embassy to Sultan Ahmed KMn, the new Euler of Herat, in August 1857, to ascertain that the provisions of the treaty had been faithfully fulfilled. He was received with all due respect and cordiality by the new ruler in December. Colonel Taylor left Herat on March 1, 1858. 2 The war with Persia, doubtless, will have an excellent effect on the Government of that country, for they cannot fail to perceive how completely their southern provinces are open to invasion, which in a contest be tween Englishmen and Asiatics is equivalent to con- 1 Brigadier Honner did not finally evacuate Karak until Feb- ruary 4, 1858, and the Persians delayed the evacuation of Lash and Juwain in Sistan. 2 Ahmed, ruler of Herat, desired to succeed the Dost as Chief of the Barakzais. He invaded the Dost's territory, and took Farrah by treachery. In May 1862 the Dost commenced his march against Ahmed, drove him back into Herat, and besieged the town through out the winter of 1862-3. A Persian force hovered about the frontier, restrained from assisting Ahmed by the British minister at Tehran, who insisted upon the observance of the treaty of 1857. Ahmed died in the spring of 1863, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sirdar Shanawaz Khan. Dost Muhammad took Herat, and in 1865 the place was ruled by a lad of sixteen named Sirdar Muhammad Yak^b Khan, son of the present ruler of Kabul, who is again governor of Herat for his father.512 HISTORY OF PERSIA. quest, by means of the river Karun. But it is the interest of England that Persia should remain strong and independent; and if a really patriotic minister should rise up, the most cordial friendship might be established between the two countries. In case of the SMh's death, he had proclaimed his second son (by a Sigheh marriage) to be Waly 'Ahd; 1 and Bahrain Mirza, his uncle, who is now a Kussian pensioner, residing at Tiflis, would probably have been Eegent. But the Shah has an only brother also. Prince 'AbMs Mirza, whom he hates most cordially, and who now lives at Baghdad. The Sadr-'Azam, who, by the most fulsome flattery, managed to retain his office for several years, followed on the same road as his worthy predecessor Hajji Mirza Aghasy. All men of any worth or talent were banished or degraded, every place was given to his worthless relations, and the provinces were every day becoming more discontented and poor ; the finances were in disorder, the Turkmans continued their inroads into Khurasan, and the army was irregularly paid. At last the Sadr-'Azam was disgraced, and died at Kum in 1860. The office was not filled up, but Farukh KhAn, the former minister to England, became Keeper of the Seals and Minister of the Interior. In the autumn of 1857 Murad Mirza invited eighty Turkman chiefs to a conference at Mash-had, and treacherously threw them into prison. He then marched against the Turkmans, as far as Sarakhs, the 1 The Wal}' 'Ahd, to whom the Shah was much attached, died on June 29, 1858.HI THE KHURASAN FRONTIER. / enemy retreating before him. In December he defeated the Turkmans, and occupied Merv. But the Turkmans continued their incursions to the very gates of Mash-had during the two following years; and SuMn Murad Mirza was replaced in the govern ment of Khurasan by Hamza Mirza. In July I860 the new governor re-occupied Merv; and in the fol lowing October he met with a disastrous defeat in an attempt to storm the entrenched camp of the Tekeh Turkmans, further down the course of the Milrghab. The Persian army fled in all directions, leaving thirty field guns in the hands of the victors. Since that time the Persians have contented themselves with keeping a strong garrison at Sarakhs, and making occasional forays against the Turkmans, in one of which the thirty guns abandoned in 1860 were recovered. When the English officers left Persia in 1838, they were succeeded by some French officers, whose efforts to disciphne the troops were a complete failure. After wards the instruction of the Persian army was in the hands of a few refugee Italians and some Germans lent by Austria. The flower of the army is drawn from Azerbaijan. During the last fifteen years Persia has made progress as regards political power and material prosperity, in spite of the deplorable mal-administration of the Kajars, and the terrible famine which devastated the country from 1870 to 1872, One source of hope for the future may be derived from the probable cessation of foreign wars, owing to the establishment of settled frontiers. Prom time514 HISTORY OF PERSIA. immemorial, Persia has had elastic limits. When ruled by capable and ambitious sovereigns, the Persian empire has extended almost over half Asia; while the prevalence of anarchy has led to the rise of petty independent states in all directions. Thus, there have always been vast claims to territory which could not be enforced, and uncertain frontiers which led to continual disputes. The increase of stability and power, com mencing from the reign of Muhammad SMh, led to the raising of some of these claims, and has finally had the happy result of settling most of them, and of establishing fixed boundaries guaranteed by treaties. The Russian boundary, west of the Caspian, was settled definitively by the Treaty of Turkmanchai; 1 and a belt of neutral ground between Turkey and Persia was marked out by the joint English and Russian Commission, which was at work from 1843 to 1865. 2 Since then, the Arab occupation of Persian ports in the Gulf has finally ceased, and portions of the frontier on the eastern side of Persia have been settled. It will be useful briefly to notice the events which have led to these arrangements, commencing with the ques tion of the Arab occupation of ports in the Persian Gulf. The rulers of 'OmUn had held Bandar 'Abbas and other ports in farm from the Shah of Persia since 1798, 3 for an annual payment of 6,000 tomans. But in 1854 the Persians drove the Seyyid's officials and garrisons from the ports they occur* Bd on the shores of the Gulf, 1 See page 397 2 Page 485. 3 Page 425.ARRANGEMENTS WITH MlSKAT. 515 and which the Arabs looked upon as belonging to 'Oman in perpetuity, provided that the stipulated rental was paid. An Arab expedition, under the Seyyid Thuwainy, 1 succeeded in re-capturing Bandar Abbas, and other places. But the Persians were largely reinforced, while the British authorities interfered to prevent our Arab allies form joining Thuwainy by sea. That prince was, therefore, obliged to make the best terms he could with the Persians; and a treaty was concluded in April 1856. Bandar Abbis, the islands of el-Kishm and Ormuz, Minav, and other places were declared to belong to the Persian Government. The Seyyid of Maskat was to be allowed to rent them for 16,000 tomans a year, and to appoint governors for twenty years, who were to render obedience to the Governor of Shiraz. At the expiration of twenty years, these places were to be restored to Persia, with which power it was to rest to decide whether the farm should be renewed or not. 2 The Seyyid's Wali or Governor was thus virtually reduced to the condition of a Per sian vassal, removable at the caprice of the Governor of Shir&amp;z. It is said that this humiliating agree ment broke the heart of the old Seyyid Sa'id, the faithful ally of England, who died on his way back to Zanzibar, on board his frigate, the ' Victoria,' on October 19, 1856. His son and successor, Seyyid Thuwainy, was murdered by his own son Salim, at Sohar, on February 11, 1866. In October 1868 S&amp;lim was surprised and 1 See page 483. 2 See Badger's Seyyids of ) Omdn ) p. xcv.516 HISTORY OF PERSIA. driven out of Mashad by one 'Azzan-bin-Kais, 1 the W41i of er-Eastak; and since then, Seyyid Tfirky, a brother of Thuwainy, has become ruler of Mashad. This unsettled state of affairs in the Arab principality has given an excuse to the Persian Government, within the last few years, for assuming the entire government of Bandar 'Abbas and the other ports. It is on the whole a beneficial arrangement that the system of farming the ports by a foreign and independent sove reign should have come to an end; and that the farmers of customs should be more directly responsible to the Persian Government. The development of the re sources of Kirm^n and Pars, and of the trade of the Persian Gulf, are likely to give great future importance to the port of Bandar 'Abbas. The southern limits of Persia have thus been settled. Her eastern frontier, where Persian terntory borders on Baluchistan, Sistan, and Afghanistan, has also been the subject of investigation. The Government ^ of Muhammad Shah had adopted a policy of enforcing what they called a re -acknowledgment of Persian suzerainty from alleged vassals, who had in some cases been refractory, and in others had altogether shaken off allegiance and declared themselves independent. Under this theory, Afghanistan and Baluchistan were two states which belonged in their entirety to Persia, having been her provinces in the days of Nadir Shah, and formed part of that outlying power which she wished gradually to bring back under her home government. After the 1 A descendant of the Imam Ahmed (see page 425), His father was made Governor of er-Rastak by Seyyid Sa'id.THE MAKEAN BOUNDARY. 517 war with. England in 1857, these Persian encroachments became more systematic; and ten years of unscrupulous and vigorous action pushed the boundary line of Persia nearly five degrees of longitude to the eastward, but south of Sistan. In 1866, the Persians claimed as far as a point between Charbar and Gwadar, on the Mekran coast, and forcibly asserted possession over the whole of western Baluchistan ; and, in the same year, Sistan was occupied by Persian troops. There w T ere thus boundary disputes between Persia and her eastern neighbours; and in August 1870, at the request of the Persian Government, and with the concurrence of the Amir of Afghanistan and the Khan of Kalat, Sir Frederic Goldsmid, with the local rank of Major-Gene- ral, was sent out as Commissioner for the settlement of the boundary limiting Persian encroachment on Baluchistan and Sistan. He arrived at Tehran on October 3, but was unable to take up the Sistan work owing to the disturbed state of Afghanistan. After the death of Dost Muhammad in 1863, 1 his favourite son Shir Aly succeeded, and the eldest, named Afzul, was imprisoned. But in 1865, Abdu- r-Eahman, son of Afzul, and Azim, another son of Dost Muham mad, surprised K^bul and expelled Shir Aly. A civil war prevailed for the three following years. Afzul 1 See pages 467 and 480. Dost Muhammad only ruled over Kabul, including Jalalabad, from 1826 to 1850. In 1850 lie com menced aggressions on Turkistan. In 1855, on the death of his brother Kohun-dil-KMn, he acquired Kandahar. In 1857 he annexed Sabzawar, Lash, Farrah, Andkho, and Maimaneh. n 1860 he acquired Kiinduz and BadaksMn, and in 1868, the year ot his death, he captured Herat.518 . HISTOKY OF PERSIA. died in 1867, and in January 1868, after several changes of fortune. Shir 'Aly Khan entirely defeated Azim and Abdu-'r-Eahman, and again became Euler of Afghan- tan. Azim died in Persia, and Abdu-'r-Eahman took refuge with the Eussians at Samarkand. In 1869 Shir 'Aly had an interview with Lord Mayo at Ambala; and he has since, aided with money and arms by the Govern ment of India, 1 remained in possession of Afghanistan, including Herat, Kunduz, and Badakshan. The most able of his sons is Yakub Khan, 2 the Governor of Herat, whose rebellion in 1870, the scene of which was the province of Sistan, retarded the proceedings of Sir Frederic Goldsmid. In 1871, he was pardoned by Shir 'Aly Khan, and is again Governor of Herat; but Abdalla is the Amir's favourite son. 3 In consequence of the disturbances caused by Yakiib in Sistan, Sir Frederic Goldsmid proposed to commence 1 In December 1868, Lord Lawrence sent Shir 'Aly 6 lakhs of rupees and 3,500 stand of arms, and in January 1869 he added six more lakhs. Lord Mayo, in 1870, added 6,500 more stand of arms, 4 18-pounder siege guns, 2 8-inch howitzers, a mountain battery of 6-pounders, 9 elephants with gear, ammunition, 2 more lakhs of rupees, and afterwards more small arms. 2 See note at p. 511.

General Goldsmid thence moved on to Gwadar, making enquiries into the geo graphical and political questions as he marched, and detaching an engineer officer for further survey. After much delay, the Persian Commissioner followed him to the sea coast, and finally the general returned to Tehran, by way of Bushire and Shir&amp;z. After a pro tracted discussion, in which the Shah himself took a prominent part,Goldsmid's line for the Mekran boundary was accepted by the Persian Government. In 1871, Sir Frederic Goldsmid left England with his staff, to negotiate the arbitration for the Sistan fron tier, proceeding by way of Calcutta, in order to have an interview with Lord Mayo. Landing at Bandar 'AbMs, Sir Frederic marched thence to Sistan, where, after a month's stay, he was joined by General Pollock and Dr. Bellew, who came from India by way of Kandahar. Every obstacle was then thrown in the way of a fair arbitration; and, three days after the arrival of General Pollock, the whole party repaired to Tehran, by way of Mash-had. At Tehran, the negotiations, which had been broken off in Sistan, owing to the con duct of the Persian Commissioner, were renewed; and on August 19, 1872, Sir Frederic Goldsmid delivered his full and formal arbitration. Both the Persian and Afghan Commissioners appealed; but Lord Granville, the final referee, supported the decision, which was eventually accepted by both appellants. The eastern frontier of Persia is now as shown on the Map which520 HISTORY OF PERSIA, accompanies this volume. The Makran frontier runs from Jalk to the sea. In Sistan, a large triangular territory, partly watered by the Helmund, is awarded to Persia; and the Afghans are prohibited from draw ing off water from the river, except for the irrigation of lands along its banks. A chain of hills fills up the gap between the Makran and Sistan lines; and if the old conventional line from Herat to Sistan be adopted, the whole eastern frontier of Persia is settled. But that famous frontier to the north of Khurasan, between Merv and the Caspian, the scene of Turanic invasions from time immemorial, remains unsurveyed. The Eussians, in 1870, acknowledged that Persian juris diction extended to the mouth of the Atrak, and it includes the whole basin of that river, and its northern tributaries. The frontier passes along the ridge known as the Daman-i-koh or Atak (skirt), and goes thence to the MftrgMb, thus including Sarakhs and Merv. But the exact line is still uncertain; and the recent encroach ments of the Eussians, whose frontier is now extended to Khiva and the Oxus, renders an early settlement of this part of the Persian boundary one of the most urgent and important of existing Asiatic political questions. The settlement of her boundaries is a very great boon to Persia ; for the cessation of endless disputes with neighbouring states gives her people some chance of improving the internal condition of the country. Better means of communication have scarcely been thought of as regards the interior; but of late years great facilities have been provided for approaching both the Caspian and Persian Gulf ports, which have increasedSTEAM COMMUNICATIONS. 521 the trade, and the intercourse with foreign countries, and have thus been the means of enabling the Persians to make some slight advance in material prosperity. On the Caspian the Caucase et Mercure Company of Moscow, receiving a large subvention from the Eussian Government, on condition of furnishing all the trans port that may be required, has a large and increasing fleet of three-masted schooners with auxiliary screws. Two or three of these vessels sail every week from the port of Astrakhan, carrying merchandise only. There are also three passenger steamers plying on the Cas pian, belonging to the same Company; 1 and one sails every week along the western and southern shores, touching at the Persian ports of Enzeli and Mash-had-i- sar, and at Ashurada. A good macadamised causeway has been made across the morass from Enzeli to Eesht, and both places have been much improved of late years. In the Persian Gulf the British India Steam Navi gation Company now has a regular line of fine steamers running fortnightly from Bombay to el-Basrah, and touching at Bandar 'Abbas and Bushire; and the trade of the Gulf ports is rapidly increasing. The construction of the electric telegraph has also had a sensible effect on the progress of Persian civilisa tion. Lines from Tehran to Tabriz and Eesht were constructed by the Persian Government itself in 1862. In the same year Colonel Patrick Stewart was employed 1 Two paddle-wheel steamers, of about 800 tons each, the ' Con- stantine' and 4 Bariatinsky,'and a screw steamer of 250 tons, the 4 Michael.' All the crews are Persians, from the coasts of Ghilan and Mazandaran.522 HISTOEY OF PERSIA. to report upon the practicability of constructing a telegraphic line through Persia, as a link of the com munication between England and India. A tele graphic convention, an abstract of which will be found in the Appendix, was signed between England and Persia on February 6, 1863, in spite of the intrigues of Eussia. The line was to pass from Khanakin on the Turkish frontier to Tehran, and thence to Bushire. But Colonel Stewart did not live to see the successful result of his labours. He died at Constantinople in January 1865, from the effects of exposure and over exertion, a very short time before the lines were for mally opened. English officers have since worked the line between Tehran and Bushire. Another conven tion, in 1865, provided for a second wire; and a third convention, in 1872, arranges that a third wire shall be erected at the expense of the English Government. The Indo-European Telegraph Company, in 1870, carried a telegraph line from Tehran to London, by way of Tabriz, Tiflis, Kertch, Warsaw, Berlin, and Nordeney. The absence of correct statistics makes it difficult to acquire any sound knowledge of the population, wealth, trade, and agriculture of Persia, or of the condition of the people. The population is placed at 4,000,000 by one high authority, and at 10,000,000 by others. 1 We have little information respecting the rules and 1 The Bengal Census has given a striking example of the worth- lessness of rougli estimates of population derived from revenue returns. In 1870-71 the population of the Lower Provinces was believed to be 42,600,000. The total number counted in the Census of 1872 was 66,856,859.THE TRAVELS OF THE SHAH. 523 customs for the use of water in irrigation, and no ac curate trade returns. 1 But it is certain that the system of farming provinces still prevails, and that, though there are exceptions, such as Kirmftn, where a wise governor has created prosperity in spite of the sys tem, 2 the country is on the whole wretchedly governed. The present Shah, since the fall of the Sadr-Azam in 1858, has generally ruled without a Prime Minister, though one was appointed shortly before his journey to Europe, and disgraced on his return. But he has shown little wisdom, and has not been an exception to the proverbial administrative incapacity of the Kajar Turks. In 1870 he undertook a useless and enor mously expensive pilgrimage to Kerbela; instead of adopting the wise policy of the Sufawi Shahs. 'Abbas the Great did all in his power to make the shrines popular that were within the limits of Persia, such as Ivum and Mash-had; in order that the wealth of devotees might be retained in the country, instead of being drained away into Turkey or Arabia. 3 In 1873 Nasru-'d-Din made another expensive journey through Europe, possibly with more useful results, in enlarging his ideas and those of his relations and immediate fol lowers. But this may be considered doubtful. The most recent important act of the Persian Government has been the grant of a concession for the construction of public works to Baron Renter: a full 1 A nominal return for Bnshire, in 1870, gives the valne of exports at 153,000/., and imports at 470,000/. Colonel Pelly has also given the quantities, but not the value, for Bandar Abbas. 2 See note at p. 401. 3 See page 280.524 history of persia. abstract of which will be found in the Appendix. Baron Eenter, in the first place, under a penalty of 40,000/., engages to construct a railway from Eesht, on the Caspian, to Tehran; to be eventually continued to a port on the Persian Gulf; and, in return, the Shah grants him exclusive privileges of constructing public works for seventy years. The distance from Eesht to Tehran is about 200 miles, and Baron Eeuter's engineers have already begun to survey the line; but there is probably little prospect of the other works mentioned in the concession being undertaken for some years to come. 1 All these undertakings—the lines of steamers touch ing at the Caspian and Persian Gulf ports, the tele graph lines, and the works of Baron Eeuter—are hopeful signs of advance ; and the completion of the projected railways and other public works can alone save the land from such fearful visitations as the famine of 1870-72. Persia needs peace, and a respite from Eussian encroachments and intrigue, to ensure her future welfare. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of this interest ing country, there is a charm about its former history which will always command attention. IeIn :— where the pure religion of Zoroaster flourished; where the Kings who did the work of the Almighty reigned; where the palace of Persepolis reared its 1 The Persian Government are recently reported to have declared the Convention with Baron Eeuter null and void, on the ground that the stipulation to commence work at a certain date had not been complied with.CONCLUSION. 525 beautiful pillars on high; and where Sa'ady and Hafizh wrote their soul-stirring poetry,—must ever be an enchanted land, full to overflowing of the most delightful associations. We picture to ourselves the mighty Kings of old, the heroes as generous and merciful as they were brave, the lovely maidens, and the inspired poets of Iran, until the whole history rises up before us like a wondrous mirage. The traveller over the sands of Mesopotamia may sometimes behold its counterpart in the ruined palace of the ancient kings of Iran, at Ctesiphon. Gazing, from the opposite shores of the Tigris, he will be astonished at the sight of vast arcades, which will change into a beautiful tower reaching to the sky, and pierced from base to summit by innumerable arches. Suddenly this fairy vision will be converted into a magnified image of the palace, with an exact counter part upon it, upside down; and finally the naked ruin is seen in all its desolation, standing alone in the sandy plain. 1 Just in the same way we may dwell upon the past history of Iran ; the age of Eustam and his heroes, the precepts of Zoroaster, the gorgeous line of Sassanian Kings, the age of Poets, the restored magnificence of 'Abbas, and finally the stream of history brings us down to the naked deformity of the Kajar rule and the desolation of modern Persia. 1 Mr. Layard saw this mirage, and beautifully describes it, pp. 570-2.APPENDIX A. ABSTRACTS O I. England and Persia. The Treaty Engagements between England and Persia com menced when the English first established commercial rela tions in the ports of the Persian Gulf. These relations were opened by the letter from Queen Elizabeth to Shah Tahmasp I., written in 1561, which is the first document in the pre sent Appendix. Then follows an abstract of the Grant of Privileges from Karim Khan Zand to the East India Com pany in 1763. The Political Treaty, concluded by Malcolm in 1801, an abstract of which follows, is the first engagement between the English Government and the Kfijar Dynasty. The com mercial treaty, concluded at the same time, secured all the privileges granted by Karim Khan, while the duties to be collected from purchasers of staples were reduced to one per cent. The treaties of Sir Harford Jones, concluded on March 15, 1809, and of Sir Gore Ouseley, signed on March 14, 1812, merged in the final Treaty of Tehran, negotiated by Morier and Ellis, and signed on November 25, 1814, an abstract of which follows that of Malcolm's Treaty. In the preamble the previous negotiations are recapitulated. By Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty of Tehran the English Government undertook to aid Persia by troops or money, in case of in-528 appendix a. vasion, provided that Persia was not the aggressor. In March 1828 a letter was obtained from Prince 'Abbas Mirza, afterwards confirmed by his father, the Shah, by which Articles 3 and 4 were abrogated, on condition that the British Grovernment assisted Persia with 200,000 tomans, towards the liquidation of the indemnity due from Persia to Kussia. No commercial treaty had been concluded since that of Malcolm, which the Persians considered to be superseded by the Treaty of Tehran in 1814. In 1823 a Firman ordered that no duty should be levied on horses exported by British subjects; and in 1836 another Firman granted to British merchants the privilege of paying only the same dues as were paid by the merchants of Russia. But in 1841 Sir John McNeill at last concluded a Commercial Treaty with Per sia ; an abstract of which follows the Treaty of Tehran. Between 1848 and 1851 engagements and conventions were obtained from Persia on the subject of the Slave Trade. In the former year Firmans were issued by the Shah, at the request of Colonel Farrant, prohibiting the importa tion of negroes by sea, but declaring that the importation of slaves by land is by no means forbidden. In August 1851 a convention was made between Sir Justin Sheil and the Persian Government, permitting British ships of war, for a period of eleven years, to search Persian merchant vessels sus pected of carrying slaves. The next engagement between Persia and England was that in 1853, respecting Herat; an abstract of which follows that of the Commercial Treaty of 1841. Its breach led to the hostilities in 1867, which were concluded by the Treaty of Paris. This is the most recent treaty between England and Persia. It renews the Slave Trade Convention of 1851, and provides for its continuance. An abstract of the Treaty of Paris .follows that of the engagement respecting Herat.LETTER FROM QUEEN ELIZABETH, 529 Letter from Queen Elizabeth Tahmasp Persia, Elizabeth, by the grace of God, Queene of England, &amp;e., to the right mightie and right victorious Prince, the great Sophi, Emperor of the Persians, Medes, Parthians, Hyrcanes, Caramanians, Margians, of the people this side and beyond the river of Syris, of all men and nations between the Cas pian Sea and the Gfulf of Persia ; greeting, and most happie increase in all prosperitie.

Grant of Privileges from Karim WakU), July 2, 1763. The Great God, having of his infinite mercy given victory unto Karim Khan, and made him Chief Governor of all the kingdoms of Persia, he is desirous that the said kingdoms should flourish, and obtain their ancient grandeur by the increase of trade and commerce, as well as by a due execu tion of justice. Having been informed that the Eight Worshipful William Andrew Price, Esq., Governor of the English nation in the Gulf of Persia, is arrived with power to settle a factory at Bushire ; and has sent to me Mr. Thomas Burn ford to obtain a grant of their ancient privileges in these kingdoms; I do grant unto the said Governor, in behalf of his King and country, the following privileges, which shall be held in sacred good faith :—GRANT FEOM KARIM KHAN. 531 1. That the English Company may have as much ground at Bushire as they please, to build a factory on, or at any other port in the Gulf. They may have as many cannon mounted on it as they choose, but not to be larger than 6-pounders. 2. No customs shall be charged the English on any goods imported or exported by them at Bushire, or at any other port on the Gulf. 3. No other European nation shall import any woollen goods to any port on the Gulf; but the English Company only. 4. Should any Persian be truly indebted to the English, the Shaik or Governor of the place shall oblige him to pay. 5. In Persia the English may sell their goods to, and buy from, whomsoever they judge proper. 6. If any English ship be unfortunately wrecked, the Governors of the adjacent places shall not claim any share of the said wreck, but shall assist the English all in their power. 7. The English shall have the free exercise of their reli gion, without molestation from any one. 8. Should soldiers or sailors desert from the English in any part of Persia, they shall be delivered up. 9. Wherever the English may have a factory, their ser vants shall be exempt from taxes, and under their own com mand and jurisdiction. 10. Wherever the English are, they shall have a spot of ground for a burial place, and another for a garden. 11. The house that formerly belonged to the English Company, at Shiraz, I now re-deliver to them, with the gar den and water thereto belonging. Articles desired by Karim Khan. 1. That the English shall purchase goods from the Persian merchants, such as will answer for sending to England or India, and not export the whole amount of the sales in M M ^532 APPENDIX A. money; as this will impoverish the kingdom, and, in the end, prejudice trade in general. 2. That the English shall not maltreat the Muslim. 3. The English shall not give protection to any of the Khan's rebellious subjects. 4.

Every succeeding king gave his own name to the year, the last being Yezdegird. They intercalated one month every 120 years. But scarcely had Yezdegird given his name to the era when he was dethroned. After his time the intercalations were entirely neglected. In ancient Persia the era of Yezdegird III. began on June 16, 632, and was formerly universally adopted. The year was of 365 days, and consequently anticipated the Julian year by one day every four years. In 1079 this difference amounted to nearly 112 days, when the year was reformed under Malik Shah, who ordered an addition of one day to every four years. (See p. 144.)

Edited, with an Introduction on the Study of Geography, by the E ev. geoege butlee, m.a. Principal of Liverpool College. From the BOOKSELLER, December 1873;— { Although geography has, for a very long time, formed, in name at least, part of a good elementary education, it is surprising how little of it is carried away by most people from school, or even college. As a rule, the amount of geographical knowledge possessed by the average Englishman is just so^ much as his own experience has compelled him to acquire in later life for himself. A traveller must bring home some knowledge of the countries he visits. A merchant must know a little of the distant lands he corresponds with; readers of the daily newspapers cannot understand what they read, without some acquaintance with the scenes of political events. Recent wars have probably taught the present generation more of geography than they would ever have learnt otherwise. How many of us knew much about the Crimea and the Black Sea, before the Russian War j or of the relative position of cities and towns in India, before the mutiny; or of the relation of places in the United States of America, before the Secession War ? And yet, in itself, and apart from it$ utility, geography ought to be, and is, in fact, when properly studied, a most fascinating branch of knowledge. The various countries of the world, with their mountains and rivers, in many cases with their sea-coast, their harbours, their cities and towns, have been, and are, the stages on which the history of our race has been acted out; and to understand the history, the conformation of those scenes must be known. Then, again, the development, the civilisation, the pre-eminence of nations has often depended on their geographical position. Nations dwelling around a great highway of communication, like the Medi terranean, naturally led the way for others who, at first at least, had not the same material advantages. Nay, even it has been shewn that the character of a people may depend on the nature of the soil on which they live. The dead level of allimal lands affects their inhabitants m one way; the bold or the graceful outlines of mountains, in another and very different manner. All this tends to shew that the method of teaching geography must have been at fault if the study itself has failed to win popularity This method too often consisted in cramming up a number of names and half-digested facts, as to the heights of mountains, the lengths of rivers, the number of superficial_ square miles the populations of various countries and cities. Elaborate copying of maps, also,The Public Schools Modern Atlas, made a show of acquirement without its reality. The Maps and Atlases them selves, too, for young students especially, were crowded with names, and for that reason confused, and often repulsive to the eye. As far as appeared, one name was as important as another, and, among so many, memory failed to retain any. * This Atlas of Mr. B utler's must be credited with the best effort yet made to overcome this preliminary difficulty in the way of a young student. Clearer and more distinct maps for their size, or, indeed, for any size, we never saw. The largest type is reserved for the names of countries and their chief divisions. These all run horizontally; the letters are not scattered over the surface, but form compact words, which at once arrest the eye, and inform it. The names of rivers alone are, from necessity, made to run in the direction of their course. The colouring is just enough to indicate boundaries, without confusing type. Eivers and mountain-chains are clearly indicated; and a uniform blue-grey tint for the sea throws the varied forms of the land into effective and agreeable relief. It may be added that the most recent political changes are duly represented here. Germany forms one great and united empire ; its boundaries are those settled by the latest treaties, Austria has retired within her natural limits of the Alps, leaving Italy free and undivided from these as far as Sicily. Switzerland forms a singularly clear map; as do also the United States of America, regarding the geography of which but hazy notions exist on this side of the Atlantic. The map of South America will probably for the first time convey to many a distinct conception of the dozen little states which form a kind of picture-frame for the great empire of Brazil. A useful map of Ancient Palestine will be found in this series, designed with a special view to the study of Scripture history. The canal, which now, in point of fact, makes Africa and Asia, each of them, a vast island, has a little map to itself, or rather two little maps, shewing the former conditions of the country through which M. de Lesseps' perseverance carried the Canal of Suez. This atlas, in short, is geography made easy; it is here transformed from a school-lesson to a most agreeable pastime : to learn, one has only to look and remember. No more useful present could be made to an intelligent boy than this, to awake in him the desire to know something of the world he lives in. Its value must not be measured by its extraordinary cheapness; the price has evidently been fixed upon the assumption of an extremely large sale, for we are satisfied that not one penny of profit can be made out of the first twenty thousand copies.'
