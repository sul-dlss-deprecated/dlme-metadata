It summarises the Government of India's views given in a telegram dated 21 November 1917, with military and political grounds for objecting to Japanese assistance. It also includes extracts from the Report of the Trade Commissioners who visited Mesopotamia earlier in 1917, and raises the concern that Japanese commercial influence will lead to political claims.Written by John Evelyn Shuckburgh, 13 December 1917, with an introduction dated 18 December 1917.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Political information</topic></subject><subject><topic>Japan--Foreign relations--Great Britain </topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00029f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
