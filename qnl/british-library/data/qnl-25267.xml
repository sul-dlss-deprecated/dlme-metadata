Sir: - I have the honour to report that a meeting of the Persian Sanitary Council was held to-day - Pr. Cachet - the President in the chair. The recent epidemic of plague in the Kermanshah district. The reports of the two native doctors sent to the district, have been received. They experienced great difficulties in their worlc owing to the ignor ance of the people. Their estimates of the number of cases and deaths are necessarily vague. A PESIT^ of these reports will he published in the PPOCflS VEFBAh of the meeting. m he points which struck me more particularly on hearing them read out were:- 1. The irregular distribution of the disease: cases where only one person in a family was attacked were mentioned. 2. The comparatively high percentage of pneu monic cases. 3. ^he absence of any mortality among rodents, and the report of cases of sickness among the village dogs.dogs. It was decided to recall Dr. Haydar T -irza who was sent from here to Kermanshah on plague duty - no new cases having been notified since August. T he Turco-^erslgn Frontier . The Commission of the Constantinople Board of Health appointed to investigate the sanitary defence of the frontier, has at last started on its oft deferred journey. It is to begin operations at Basra. The Persian delegate to the Board is a member of the Commission. He is to come to Tehran, fro^ Khanikin (where the journey of the Com mission will end) to report to the Banitary Council. The ,, general sanitary condition of Persia : presents nothing abnormal. Other matters discussed were of local interest such as the sanitary reports from the different pro vinces, the public vaccination service, &amp;c., &amp;c. Dr. Beistmantel, the Austrian, delegate was again absent. TJ e has now missed six or more meetings. During the Summer he left Tehran without notice on a journey to Baghdad. This is now reported to have been made at the request of the 'Treasurer General with the object of studying sanitary questions on the Turkish- frontierfrontier. If this is so, both the Treasurer General and Dr. Feistmantel would appear to have treated the Sanitary Council rather strangely. Dr. ^eistmantel returned at the end of August.

The Persian doctors sent by the Sanitary Council to deal with the epidemic are still on the spot and their report on its whole course is shortly expected. Morphinism in Persia. - A very interesting report from a native physician at Nishapur was read in which he described how the use of morphine by hypodermic injection is spreading in that town. It would appear that in man:/ of the tea-houses, syringes and solutions 1 of morphine are kept for the use of customers. The writer had seen man:/ cases of morphinism: some covered with abscesses as the result of the use of dirty needles: he had also seen sane fatal results either duedue to an overdose or to tetanus* The use of opium has already had disastrous effects in Persia. A few ill-directed efforts to diminish it have been made and have failed. To the opium pill and to the opium pipe has now been added the morphine syringe. Other matters discussed were the Public vaccination service and the comnletion of the Quaran tine establishments on tho Caspian. I am &amp;c., (Signed) A.R.

Dr. Feistmantel lias not attended the meetings of the Council for two months past. Many surmises were made as to the object of his journey. I believe it is a fact tiiat he has been sent by the Treasury to report on sanitary matters on the Turco-Turco-Persian frontier. Nothing ho\/ever is known ..|H—II»II for certain except tlmt lie is at Kemansliali. Trie Sanitary Council lias not teen consulted about the matter at ail. In fact in the month of June the Coiuicil invited Dr. Feistmantel to go to the Ker- mansliah district on plague duty. This he refused indignantly and somewhat rudely to do.

The following Is a resume of the reports received from the Governor since the last meeting of the Council (June 5th). June 15th . The epidemic exists in the Kalhor district and at Liah-l-Dasht. A commission has boon formed at Kemanshah to carry out the necessary measures. A Persian doctor with 50 Cossacks has left for the affected district. June. 17th . Ifeh-i-Dasht; no deaths for 13 days. jam-i-Shuran; no deaths for 7 days. Zanireh; no deaths for 6 days. June 22nd . Harunabad; one death on the 20th. The inhabitants have scattered and carried the disease to Suran-Larz, Nokneh, Lenjai, Karend and Surkheh Dlseh. June 50th . Jam-i-Shuran; one case daily. In each telegram the Governor urged that doctors ho sont from Tehran. As Dr.Heydar liilrza who was selected for plague duty by the Council at its meeting onon June 5th was present at this meeting, I asked why he had not left Tehran,, Dr.Gachet in reply said that in order to give ef fect to the measures which the Council had proposed to take with regard to the epidemics In Khorassan and in Kermanshah, he had limed lately infomied the Governor of them. In the case of Khorassan he had submitted to them the telegram from the Russian doctor at Kariz which askod for 10,000 tomans limed lately (see proces verbal of meeting of June 5th page 168). In the case of Ker manshah he had asked for pay and travelling expenses for the doctors chosen by the Council for plague duty. The Minister of the Interior had replied that the Council had 15,000 tomans a year secured on the northern customs and that it should use this money for dealing with the present epidemics. Dr.Gachet had replied that this money* was intended purely for the sanitary service in the Caspian Sea, and that he could not agree to its being spent on other objects. He had pressed the Government but had been met with a refusal to grant the Council any money while it had any of the 15,000 tomans to its credit. No money had therefore been sent to Meshed - and the doctors had not left for Kermanshah A\ A long diBcueeioii Xollowod, Doctor G&amp;chat in- Bistlng on his point of viaw, the Persian raembei-B and the Turkish delegate Insisting that the money (the 15,000 tomane) was the Government's money and that It, could do what it liked with it. Unfortunately Doctor Gachet became painfully excited and used ex pressions which the occasion certainly did not demand. He abused the Treasurer General, the Persian Govern ment and thu Persian members present, said that tills was a trap laid for tlis Council and that it could do what it liked, he would be no party to spending money on one object when it vu-s definitely ear-marked for another. The Council hod difficulty enough in obtain ing the funds to wliich it had a right, and now it was proposed to distribute them right and loft without any certainty as in the case of Khorassan, that the money would be properly spent. As soon as it became possible to get a v/ord in I said that as far as the epidemic in Khorassan was concerned I was entirely with the President. The reports hud been vague and variable especially those readread at that meeting, nothing had been heard of the Sanitary conraiusion at Meshed, the formation of which had hean recommended by the Council. As to the general question whether the 15,000 tomans should be spent anywhere except on the shores of the Caspian I beliuved that the only reservation that existed was that the money was for quarantine and other sanitary measures in the North of Persia. ?/ith regard to the Caspian Sea the Persian Government had during the time when I had acted as President made special grants for the quarantine stations etc. As to the epidemic in Kermanshali, there vas no doubt about its nature and there existed locally the proper machinery for super vising expenditure. I was therefore in favour of sending doctors to the spot at once. I knew about the special arrangement made some years ago with re gard to the 15,000 tomans, but as a matter of fact though a very satisfactory arrangement from the Council's point of view the money hod always been held at its disposal by the Persian Government before that date, and had been spent on such occasions as the present. By tMs Tiirae the Secretary hod returned with the letterlatter which Monel our Momord had written to the President oi the Sanitary Council after the con version of Persia's debt to Russia some three years ago. Doctor Georges and I had always agreed that there was no occasion to read it to the Council, which simply knew that a sura of 15,000 Touans a year was at its dlsposox for sanitary purposes in the north of Persia. Doctor Gachet now read the letter: it stated that the sura of 15,000 Tomans v/as to be paid half-yearly to the Sanitary Council, as a fixed charge on the Northern Customs receipts; and tliat this sura was for quarantine and other sanitary expenses in that part of Persia north of a line frora Khanikin etc. etc. My proposal was then adopted. Doctors will leave at once for Kermanshah, but in the case of Khorassan further enquiries will bo made as to the results of the two principal proposals mode by the Council. They were:- (1) That a Sanitary Comission be formed at Meshed to deal with the present as with the recent epidemic, (2) That two European doctors be sent frora MeshedMeshed to Karls to report on the epidemic. The 'Commission des finances. 1 ’ A letter was read from Doctor Pelstmantel critic!s Ins certain recent expenditure especially vdth regard to the Public Vaccination service, and tendering Ms resignation as 'reported'. The President gave adequate reasons for the increased cost o£ each vaccination during the past campaign and stated that in ids opinion the monthly meetings of the Got/imission were a work of supererogation. The accounts were kept on a definite plan, they were not very complicated and were open to whoever wished to see them. He proposed that a 'commission of control' be appointed and that he should be allowed to cull it together when he con sidered it advisable. The meeting approved of this proposal and the following were elected members of the new coKBaission:- The President (ex-officio), the representative of the Ministry of the Interior, Doctor Quin Khan and myself. I am, &amp;c., (Signed) A. R. Nellgan M.D01)8esrvatione on tha Meeting. 'TS^ i IDldatalc In Khore,s&amp;c~m. A oart,ain anount of vaguonose still exist b about the real nature of the epidemic in the Karls district. It is true tliat the RUBsien doctor there has declared it to he similar to the epidemic of last year, and has stated that he has seen two cases of pneumonic plague. The author ities at hushed however seam to he duhious (vide telegrams noted above) and moreover no local eorTaissiosi has been fonted as was done last year - although the Sanitary Council specially recotsaended its formation. It will be remembered that His Majesty's Consul General at Meshed urged at the beginning of the outbreak that a competent European doctor he sent to Karla by the Son!uary Council. Unfortunately no European here was free to go, and so 'with the additional attraction of saving time and expenses, the Sanitary Council tele graphed to Meshed asking that two European doctors be sent from there. At the meeting the names of the doctors of His Majesty's Consulate General and of the Russian Consulate General were mentioned. His Majesty'sMajesty's Minister accordingly instructed Major Sykes to seise the opportunity of sending Captain Wilson I.M.S. who had reported on the recent epidemic. Un fortunately that Officer was just about to leave Persia and Ms successor Captain Thorbum I.M.S. fell ill and liad to go on leave immediately on arriving at Meshed. As a consequence no one has visited the district affected excepting the Bussiftn doctor from Karla, though His Majesty's Consul General reported on June 28th that 'Russian doctors and cossacks are reported to be bound for Karis'. In any case according to the information received the Russian authorities have not token the same vigorous steps that they took in the last epidemic, and the cry of plague in Afghan istan lias not been raised. Hie present epidemic has not caused more than about forty known deaths and has probably alrudy died out. It is unfortunate that no impartial observer lias been able to study it on the | spot, but both His Majesty's Legation and the Sanitary Council did their best to get this done.xon In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 49950 and address- The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

According to a telegraiu received from the Gover nor (Fanaen Fanaa) the district between Harounabed a-nd iahidasht is most involved. At and near the former village 150 cases have been reported. The Governor ask sd for help in the ohepe of doctors .drugo, and Cossacks. The Council decided:- 1. To send two dcctcro from here and to cell upon others at ISfcua&amp;dan to hold theiui.elves ready. Haydor Kirsa who has had experience of an epidemic of plague in the same district 15 years ago agreed to leave at once. He will be accompanied by either Doctor Cook.Doctor Feistmantel or another Persian. 2. To ask for a force of gendanes or Cossacks to be sent to the district at once. 3. To request the Government to forbid the movement of pilgrims through or from the district. 5. To order plrgue prophylactic from Ft.Peters burg .

The mildness of this year's epidemic was commented on. (16 cases with 15 deaths since April 8 th). The recent epidemic in the Kemanshah district.. In my report of the meeting of the Sanitary Coun cil on March 4 th last I described a 'note” on this epidemic which was read by the Turkish Delegate and in which he censured the Fepresentative of the Sanitary Council at Kermsnshah and stated his conviction that the epidemic was one of plague. He communicated a similar note to the Constantinople Board and this ap- peared in the last proces-verbal received here. The President read it to the meeting and objected strongly to Dr. Cazala's severe censure of the Kermanshah Dele gate. He pointed out that the latter's diagnosis of anthrax had since been upheld by the Doctor of the local PussianRussian Consulate who had made a retrospective en quiry. Dr. Cxazala was of course entitled to express his opinion hut it would he only fair if he brought this latter fact to the notice of the Constantinople Board. Dr. Gazala said he saw no reason why he should do this. This incident only shows again the difficulty of getting accurate information in this country. If my original account he referred to it will he seen that one of the grounds on which the Turkish Delegate based his opinions of the epidemic in Ker- manshah was the coincident outbreak of plague in Khorasan. He stated his belief that nomads carried the infection from one place to the other. The absurdity of this view was demonstrated at the time. It would no doubt surprise Dr. Gazala not a little were he told what is almost certainly the case that in view of the reports of His Majesty's Consul-General at Meshed the epidemic in Khorasan was not plague.

Dr. Neligan to Sir W. Townley. ^' ir &gt; ^ Tehran, March 4, 1913. I HA\ E the honour to report that a meeting of the Sanitary Council was held to-day—Hr. Gachet, the President, in the chair. Telegrams were read from the Governor and from the delegate of the Sanitary Council at Kermanshah, which described an epidemic of an acute and very fatal disease in the neighbourhood of Khoramabad. It had begun apparently in October, and had lasted three and a-half months. In one village sixty out of one hundred people attacked had died. The symptoms were “swelling of the glands in the neck, axilla and groin, with fever and constipation.” The delegate had seen only two cases, one dead, the other recovered. He gave it as his opinion that the disease was anthrax. The villagers said it was due to eating the flesh of some sheep that had died. Several members at once stated their opinion that, in view of the symptoms described, the epidemic could be nothing less than plague. The Turkish delegate then read a note in which he took the same view, adduced the authority of Pronst and Tholozan as to previous epidemics in the same region, and stated his opinion that the recent epidemic of plague in Khorasan was started by the movement of nomads to that province from Kermanshah. He furthur criticised the responsible authorities for not having taken action, and asked what was to be done. After a good deal of rather excited discussion 1 said that, contrary to what had been said, I knew of several out breaks of anthrax in country villages in Persia ; that it was inconceivable that plague could be carried from the Turkish frontier to the Afghan frontier by nomads, in view of the fact that they did not migrate so far; that though the symptoms described suggested plague very strongly, the council could not do more than express this opinion, ask for further information and be prepared to take immediate action should there be another outbreak in the future, in order to settle the diagnosis. These views were approved of, and it was decided to ask the Government to arrange for an enquiry sur place by the liussian doctor at Kermanshah, the Turkish sanitary delegate who is to arrive there shortly, and the local Persian doctors. The proces-verhal of the last and final meeting of the Sanitary Commission at Meshed was read. At it the report of Captain Wilson and Hr. i'aplotinsky had been approved, and the nature of the epidemic—namely plague—reaffirmed. The removal of the quarantine cordon was also approved. Several liussian doctors, Captain Wilson and two Russian officers were recommended for decorations. A procif^verbal of a meeting at Karez, which was assembled when Captain Wilson and Hr. Zaplotinsky arrived there in the course of their investigation was also read. EASTERN SANITARY REEORMS. CON EIHENTIAL. Section 2. [12981] No. 1. Sir JV.

The Epidemic in Khorasan. 1 his described the microscopical diagnosis of the epidemic from preparations made [2857 u—2]2 from the body of a dead tarubazan (a species of marmot) found in November. This same meeting has been described by Captain Wilson in his report on his journey through the region of the epidemic (see Tehran despatch to Foreign Office, No. 7 , Commercial, of the 17th February). 1 he following additional facts quoted from the proccs-verbal in question are worthy of attention :— 1 . It was decided to recommend that ( 1 ) a Russian doctor should reside again at Turbat-i-Haidari, and that an additional doctor should be attached to the Russian troops at Meshed; ( 2 ) that the number of Cossacks at Karez should be increased by twenty-five men in order to ensure the formation of a sanitary cordon should the necessity arise ; (3) that portable laboratories for the diagnosis of plague should be kept at Jvarez and at Turbat-i-Haidari, and that 150 roubles per annum should be jiaid for their upkeep. 2 . The Russian officers on the spot engaged about 300 Persians as quarantine guards, and paid them “ des ressources personnelles,” as the Persian Government had not provided the necessary funds, their pay being 12 tomans for mounted, 0 tomans for foot men. The French translation of the Russian text adds : “en consequence, ces cavaliers devenaient personnellement des homines russes places dans les postes.” 3. The outbreak of plague at Merv is put down to contraband runners from Northern Afghanistan. The proces-verbal is signed by Captain Wilson, by four Russian doctors (the doctor of the Russian Consulate-General at Meshed, the doctor permanently at Karez, and the two plague specialists sent by the Russian Government from Tashkent and two Russian officers). The meeting closed with rather a stormy scene between I&gt;r. Gachet and the Persian members. He expressed the opinion that he could deal directly with any of the Persian Ministries he chose. The delegate of the Ministry of the Interior con tested this and rightly, for it had been decided during the period in which I acted as President of the Council, that all communications should be addressed to the Ministry of^ the Interior. I had already told Dr. Gachet of this, and it is unfortunate that he raised the point in this way, for members, such as the Austrian and German delegates, would be only too glad to see the Council an international body under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

My dear Baron Muller, Vienna, January 30, 1912. •R I P-N l UPLE to trouble you with a small matter, which, however, interests the British Government, but as I do not wish to take it up officially I make an appeal to your good offices in my private capacity. The matter relates to the excess of zeal shown by Dr. Feistmantel, the Austro-Hungarian representative on the Tehran oanitary Council, who seems to be inclined to raise questions which go beyond his proper province, and which in the present unsettled state of things in Persia had perhaps better be left untouched. ° I enclose an aide-memoire with further details explaining what His Maiestys Government complain of. As Dr. Feistmantel is, I am told, at present on leave in this country, an opportunity may perhaps present itself when vou might see proper to advise him to be a little more discreet and cautious in his attitude. Yours very truly, FAIRFAX L. CARTWRIGHT. Enclosure 2 in No. 1 . Aide-memoire. (Private and Confidential.) IT has been brought to the notice of His Britannic Majesty’s Government that an unsatisfactory situation has been created in the affairs of the Persian Gulf sanitary service by the misdirected zeal of Dr. Feistmantel, the Austro-Hungarian delegate on he Tehran Sanitary Council, and by his attitude towards the Gulf quarantine adminis- ration, which is under British management and composed of officers of the Indian Medical Service. It appears that Dr. Feistmantel has for some years past been very active in his criticisms and even attacks on that administration, and to have caused some difficulty by unnecessarily raising the question of the sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf. In particular, at a meeting of the Tehran Sanitary Council on the 30th April, f910, Dr. Feistmantel appears to have read an attack on the chief quarantine officer 111 r eference to the epidemic of plague which had broken out at Bushire. He endeavoured to show that this officer had been lacking in his duty in not orderinn ] ‘5 JUL1912* [2528 e —1] 27 llTP I i2 sanitary measures against persons leaving Bahrein ; whereas, as a matter of fact, there was at the time no plague in the island, and, moreover, Bahrein is outside the sphere of the quarantine service. Dr. Feistmantel also prepared a scheme for imposing- quarantine dues on shipping in the Gulf. Again at a meeting on the 1st May, 1911' Dr. Beistmantel read a note on the plague epidemics in the Gulf, and added that, as acting Turkish delegate, he would draw the attention of the Constantinople Board of Health to the question. This note appears to have been based on inaccurate and outside information, whereas a report on the epidemic had already been received by the Sanitary Council from the chief quarantine officer. On the 28th August Dr. Deist mantel made a formal proposal to invite a commission of the Constantinople Board of Health to visit the Gulf and study the sanitary situation there. While the British authorities do not, of course, object to any fair criticism of the Gulf quarantine service, they feel that the proposals of Dr. Feistmantel, apart from the inadvisability of opening the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf, including sentinel stations under international control, are likely to cause entirely | unnecessary trouble, besides encroaching on matters in which the Persian Government is primarily concerned.

It chiefly comprises copies of the proceedings (in French) of the 99 through to the 127 meetings of the Council, forwarded by the British Ambassador at Tehran (Sir George Head Barclay; Sir Walter Beaupre Townley) to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir Edward Grey), and then forwarded by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the Under-Secretary of State for India.The proceedings detail reports of epidemics (including plague, cholera, malaria) occurring in Persia and its neighbours (including the Persian Gulf, Russia, India), and measures taken to implement quarantine and vaccination measures to prevent their spread. In the reports, recurring mention is made of epidemics in Kermanshah [Kermānshāh], Khorassan [Khorāsān], Bouchir [Bushire] and Astrakhan. Interspersed with the meeting proceedings are copies of British Government correspondence, chiefly in the form of detailed accounts of the meetings, written by Dr Anthony Richard Neligan, physician at the British Legation in Tehran, who attended meetings in his capacity as Doctor of the Legation (Médecins de Légations).The part includes a divider which gives the subject and part number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year.
