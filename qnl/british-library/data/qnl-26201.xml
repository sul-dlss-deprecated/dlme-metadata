Luring the course of general conversation someone mentioned the recent press report that the Iraqi Government vere buying aeroplanes for the Bagono- ehran service. A’lam then remarked that he had seen this report, but that the Iraqis had not, in his vis*, any right of reciprocity es regards the establishment of such a service as s return for the present Iranian service. His argument *as that the Iranian service mas for the purpose of connecting with the International services at Bagdad; the service to Bagdad alone was of no Interest to Iran. On the basis of reciprocity the Iraqis could of course claim to run a service to /i’ ehran W. K.

I have not seen the agreement for establishing the service and do not know whether this extraordinary interpretation could be maintained on the documents. It would not be fair perhaps to take A*lam’s postprandial obiter dicta quite literally, but what he said does seem to indicate that the Iranians propose to keep this service for themselves if they can find an excuse. 5.

The aeroplane would fly from Tehran to Kermanshah each Tuesday morning, and return to Tehran on the afternoon of the same day. At first only mails and par cels up to 6 kilog. in weight would be carried. 2. Rumours that the Iranian air service would shortly be started have so frequently proved to be without foundation that this definite notice of the opening of the service came as a surprise. It appears that the bhah became impatient at the long delay and insisted on a start being made, in spite of the difficulties of winter flying in this country. The first flight was duly made on the 30th November without incident. The machine used was one of the D.H. Rapides which have now been in Iran more than eighteen months. The pilot was one of the best of the Iranian air force pilots. According to the Tehran Post Office, arrangements have been made for the extension of the service to Bagdad m a month’s time. n ^ 3. I am requesting His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah to icpoit any information which he can obtain regarding the working of the service.

I am not at present in a position to give full details of the arrangement as no public announcement has been made, but I understand that the scheme of employing British pilots favoured by the late Minister of Posts and Telegraphs is unlikely to be adopted, and that the last stage to Tehran will be flown only by Iranian pilots. 2. The same informant recently told a member of my staff that the delay in starting any service at all was having a deleterious effect on the Rapide ^ machines, the arrival of which was reported in paragraph 2 of Mr. Butler s despatch under reference, as they are neither being used nor maintained in proper condition. 3.

[E 5356/737/34] o n f *■ August 25, 1936. Section 2. Copy No. 4 7 Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—{Received August 25.) (No. 381.) Sir, Gulhek, July 30, 1936. WITH reference to Mr. Bateman’s despatch No. 354 of the 15th July, of which he was good enough to send me a copy, I have the honour to inform you that the present position with regard to the establishment of an Iranian civil air service would appear to be as follows :— 2. The three de Havilland Rapide machines ordered for the service, which were sent out crated from England, have now been assembled at Ahwaz, handed over to the Iranian authorities and flown up to Tehran. They have not yet, however, been fitted with their wireless apparatus, though this has been ordered. According to Mr. Peter de Havilland, who was responsible for the work of assembling the machines, three pilots have been selected as chief pilots for the machines. One has been in England for the past two years and is said by Mr. de Havilland to be extraordinarily good; the other two have done a special course with the de Havilland Company and, though only previously used to flying single-engined machines, have apparently accustomed themselves to these twin-engined aircraft very well. 3 . The position, when it comes to ground organisation, is infinitely less satisfactory. The civil aerodrome at Tehran is being enlarged, and some steps have already been taken to improve those at Hamadan and Kermanshah. Progress has, however, been hampered by the lack of technical knowdedge and the engineer sent to Kermanshah apparently decided that his task was altogether too difficult and asked the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to take over the work. This the company said they could not do, but they have agreed to prepare the necessary plans, and arrangements are now being made to lay out a number of run-ways. On the other projected route, that to Bushire, I gather that little or nothing has been done so far to improve the aerodromes. That at Isfahan is on a pronounced slope and the one at Shiraz was converted in the spring, possibly only temporarily, into a race-course. Mr. de Havilland understood, however, that a number of air force officers were due to leave Tehran shortly to see to the improvement of both aerodromes. 4. According to Mr. de Havilland, no provision has apparently yet been made for wireless equipment on the various aerodromes, and no serious attempt to start metereological stations. It is therefore obvious that much remains to be done, and Mr. de Havilland is of opinion that the service could not possibly be inaugurated for another four months. 5. The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs recently told a member of the staff of His Majesty’s Legation quite definitely that the Iranian Government were going to agree' to reciprocal facilities for an Iraqi service to Tehran. If this statement proves correct, then the only difficulties standing in the way of the service are the technical ones mentioned above. 6 . To turn to the more distant future : The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs also said that he would like to order five or six more machines of the same type. He would have to issue a public call for tenders, but the specifications would be so drawn up that the de Havilland Company would get the order. He did, however, expect a reduction in price. He had hinted to the Shah that the budget allotted to him for this civil air service was extremely small; but His Imperial Majesty, though apparently very pleased with the newly arrived machines which he has already inspected, had done no more than reply'drily that life was dear these days. 7. M. Hikmat also said that negotiations were proceeding with the Soviet Government in regard to the establishment of an air line to link this country with Russia. At present the service from Baku to Moscow did not run throughout [790 bb—2]2 r the year, though the Russians seemed to claim that it did; but, if and when an all the year round service came into definite operation, the Iranians might perhaps start a line to Pahlevi. The next step would then be to link Pahlevi with Baku, but M. Hikmat did not say whether this service would be run by the Russians or by the Iranians. 8 . M. Hikmat said finally that another development later on would be the creation of services to Meshed and to Tabriz. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (unnumbered), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, No. 58, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow, No. 488/8/36, and to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 62.

WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 245 of the 16th May, I have the honour to inform you that the Prime Minister recently mentioned to me the request of the Iranian Government for permission to operate an air service to Bagdad. 2. His Excellency said that when the Iranian Minister raised the matter here, he had been asked whether the Iranian Government would give reciprocal facilities to the Iraqi Government to organise an Iraqi air service from Bagdad to Tehran. The Iranian Minister had expressed doubts on this point and had drawn attention to the fact that whereas an Iranian air line had to come to Bagdad if it was to link up with the main world air lines, there was no imperative necessity for the Iraqi Government to organise an air service to Tehran. 3. Yassin-al-Hashimi asked for my advice. I said that it seemed to me a pity to obstruct the inauguration of an Iranian service from Tehran to Bagdad on the ground that the Iranian Government gave no similar rights to Iraq. On the other hand, if the Iraqi Government gave the permission requested by the Iranian Government, they would be justified in reserving the right to ask for similar treatment in Iran, if the need arose. The Prime Minister agreed. He added that it had occurred to him that if the Iraqi Government ever organised an internal flying service, they might arrange with the Iranian Government for the Khanaqin-Bagdad section of the Tehran-Bagdad route to be worked by Iraqi machines. 4. With reference to paragraph 3 of Mr. Butler’s despatch, I would invite your attention to my despatch No. 194 of the 16th April, from which it will be seen that there is no truth in the rumour that the Nairn Transport Company have obtained an air transport concession in Iraq. 5 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran and to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.

[E 3167/737/34] Copy No. f Mr. Butler to Mr. Eden.—(Received June 3.) (No. 245.) Sir, Tehran, May 16, 1936. I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 98 E. of the 22nd February last, regarding the establishment of civil air services in this country. 2 . In the guide-book in English produced by Mr. Ibtchaj, head of the Tourist Department of the Ministry of the Interior, there is a statement that civil air services were started at the end of 1935. In fact, the services have not yet been started, nor are the machines ready. They are due shortly at Ahwaz, and at least another month must elapse after that before they can be assembled, tested and handed over. Further, it is by no means certain that the service to Bagdad will be able to start even when the machines are ready, since the Iranian Government have apparently not yet obtained the consent of the Iraqi Government to their use of the Bagdad air port. 3. The story of the Iranian Government’s application to the Iraqi Govern ment was recently told to the military attache at this Legation by the Iraqi Minister of Defence, and is of considerable interest. General Jafar stated that the Iranian Government, in asking for permission to use the Bagdad airport, said that “they presumed there would be no difficulty.’' The Iraqi Government having satisfied themselves that the Iranian Government set considerable store by obtaining the desired permission, decided to use it as a bargaining counter in their present negotiations on frontier questions. They did not, however, like to admit frankly that they proposed to do so, and they were somewhat at a loss for a reply. Very fortunately, in the space of a single week, Mr. Ricketts, of oil concessions fame, Mr. Muntz, of Misr Airworks, and Mr. Nairn, of the Nairn Transport Company, all came to the Iraqi Government quite independently and suggested grandiose schemes for air-lines radiating from Iraq in all directions, including a “ holiday line ” to Cyprus. The Iraq Government were thus able to inform the Iranian Government quite truthfully that they had received other proposals, which were under consideration, and they were therefore unable to reply to the Iranian request for the present. The Air Vice-Marshal from Bagdad, who is in Tehran on a private visit, told the military attache a day or so ago that of these three applicants Mr. Nairn had been favoured, and that it was rumoured in Bagdad that he had been given a contract for air services across the Syrian desert. This would not appear to affect the Iranian service. 4. It is now said that the Iraqi Government have replied enquiring whether the Iranian Government would grant reciprocal facilities if the Iraqi Government wished to run a service to Tehran themselves. The Iranian Government were not at all taken with the idea, and for a time thought of operating their service only as far as Khosrovi. But they are said to have abandoned this plan, realising that there could be little hope of success for a service which did not connect with the big air-lines at Bagdad. The position therefore remains uncertain. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (unnumbered), to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, No. 39, and to the hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 39.

One line is to go to Bushire and the other to Bagdad. 2. Three aeroplanes (Rapides) have already been purchased from Messrs, de Havilland Company and are due to arrive soon. A good deal of freight could be carried, and six passengers. Negotiations are taking place to connect up with Imperial Airways at Bagdad. 3. Mr. Hikmat said the aeroplanes had cost the Ministry a lot of money owing to the depreciation of the rial; about £ 22,000 had been spent hitherto. 4.

On the 12th October a Telegraph Office was opened at Dairestan in Qfshm Island and telegraphic communication established between that Island and Bandar Abbas. 2. It was rumoured some time ago that the Persian Government intended establishing an air mail service between Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Bushire and Lingah.

It is understood that the air service which the German Luft Hansa Company are endeavouring to inaugurate from Berlin to Kabul will, if the various Govern ments over whose country the aircraft will pass accord permission, use the route Berlin-Stambul-Adana-Bagdad-Tehran-Kabul. It is, however, considered unlikely that the Persian Government will agree to the company operating over their territory, but it is hoped to commence a service from Berlin to Bagdad in May.Notes.

CONFIDENTIAL. . E 42/42/34] Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 2 . 1933.) (No. 539.) Sir, Tehran. December 17, 1932. HERR WEIL called on me yesterday for the purpose of learning our wishes and aspirations in the matter of civil aviation in this country. He began the conversation by expressing pleasure at the action taken by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the matter of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and then went on to give me a graphic account of his bootless efforts to induce somebody to reach a decision of some sort. In recent months he had been in consultation with most of the Ministers of State; they had been quite sympathetic and had frequently expressed the view that, if Herr Weil came back to them in a week or ten days, they might be able to tell him something definite, but the opinion most generally held was that the Minister of Court was the man who could help him. And so the months had drifted by. 2 . I told Herr Weil that his personal experiences had been very similar to those of the written proposals for an air service which, as reported in my despatch No. 182 of the 10 th April, Mr. Muntz, of Airwork (Limited), had submitted. Herr Weil said that the Luft Hansa Company had hoped that Mr. Muntz would go to Berlin and discuss the possibilities of co-operation, but he had not done so; he added that relations between Imperial Airways and the Luft Hansa were most friendly and he was convinced that this was the right policy. If Mr. Muntz was not willing to adopt it, he felt sure that the Persians would be the only gainers. I replied that I was expecting Mr. Muntz here as soon as the weather improved and that I would suggest that he should have a talk with Herr Weil. 3. He went on to tell me that he had been informed by the Soviet Ambassador that, if a British interest obtained a concession to run an air service,/ his Government would regard it as a political issue and claim the right to run one between Baku and Tehran, even though they did not wish to do so, as all their available resources were required for their internal aviation programme. In view of Herr Weil's statement, I enclose a record of a conversation with Teymourtache last April, which I did not report at the time as subsequent events rendered it unnecessary to do so. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 129). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Note of a Conversation with Teymourtache in April 1932. IN a conversation with Teymourtache on the 22nd April (before receiving Foreign Office telegrams Nos. 47 and 48 of the 22nd April) I reminded Teymourtache that in one of our first conversations (see my despatch No. 92 of the 17th February) I had told him that, but for the fact that Junkers were staying on provisionally, I should probably have been authorised to make tentative proposals to him regarding an internal British or Anglo-Persian air service working in conjunction with Imperial Airways. I had no authority to revert to the matter, but as Junkers had now gone I should be interested to know ( 1 ) whether much importance was attached to having un internal service, and (2) whether, if proposals were made by a British firm, they would be likely to be sympathetically examined. Teymourtache replied that it was interesting that I should raise the matter, as the Russian Ambassador [691 b—4]&lt;! 2 % \ had within the last day or two suggested a Sovietic service between Tehran and Pahlevi, but he had rejected the proposal. As regards my first question, the matter had what he would call a certain ‘'vanity importance ; there was, in fact, a wish to have in Persia the same things as existed in other parts of the world; but as a practical issue Persia had not yet reached the state of develop ment in which an air service was in any way a necessity. As for my second question, a British firm would, in theory, have as good a chance as anybody else.^-v The present intention, with a view to the gradual reduction of Persia’s complete dependence on foreign technicians, was to establish, under the control of the military authorities, an assembling and repair shop. If a concession were given to a foreign firm for internal flying that firm would have to fit in with this scheme. That being so, he was rather afraid that the prospects for British enterprise would not be bright. Russia was the trouble—concessions to British enterprise of the type we were considering would almost certainly result in pressure from Russia for something similar; if it were refused, there would be trouble; the natural human tendency was to avoid trouble if it could be avoided without sacrificing too much.

It is also very luxuriously and comfortably fitted up. I am satisfied that it can excel the performances put up by Junker. the Persian Government to run a regular service once a week initially and later twice a week from Baghdad to Tehran. WQ ought to have this permission as from February 1st next. This aircraft, a Spartan ff Cruiser' has a better take The point is of course that we want permission from c/o Misr - Airwork, Almaza Aerodrome, Heliopolis. The question is how to approach the Persian Government. Do we get the Iraq Government to forward our applica tion officially on behalf of an Iraqi Company? (later or any timetime now it nay be a Government owned company) • Or do we make an approach direct as an Iraqi Company i*e., do I oome up officially and in person? Or can the British legation help in any way? I gather from Sir Francis who is on this ship that the Persian Government is not over friendly at the moment in which oase it will I suppose be better not to approach through the British legation. Otherwise we want very much - in fact we are counting ion getting the Foreign Offioo hag contract i.e. t carrying the courier and bag once a fortnight on the same terms as Junkers* So I do hope you will hold this contract up till we are in the field, m shall need every single bit of support. Our idea is to standardise £16 single fare Baghdad - Tehran plus a charge for baggage in excess of 15 kgs and we have already agreed with the Iraq Government a charge of 8/4d per kg for mail, in this connexion we should want to get the Persian Mail but how to get payment? What do you think of getting it through the Iraq Government. Our intention is to come up on Wednesdays returning on Thursdays so as to feed into Imperial Airways* But we also want to connect with the Simplon Orient at Aleppo, and while we have only one machine may have to choose another day. The single aircraft operation is experimental pending the completion of negotiations with the Iraq Government and a great deal in order to get them over the various fences. I hope to have at least two in operation before the end of March. I also want the Anglo-persian Oil Company to charter one instead of the Avro 10 which is unsuitable for their Fields’ aerodromesaerodromes and anyhow far too long for their Job* The ,# cruiser n would leap in and out of their aerodromes, the Avro 10 will only crawl out. I shall be grateful for your advice and suggestions and information generally, X gather Junkers have decided to finish with Persia Otherwise we should have to suggest reciprocal operation as we are doing with Syria - one Iraq Company operating into Persia and one Persian company operating into Iraq. Our machine being so much better and safer we ought to get 75$ of the traffic anyway. Captain Stack of England-In&amp;ia and Constantinople cross country record fame is to be our chief pilot.

With regard to point 8, you may care to have the enclosed texts of Articles V and VI of Jankers contract of January 29th 1927. Junkers rent their Tehran aerodrome from a well-known Persian called Vossugh-ud-Dowleh, but I will try to ascertain the exact position. Beyond this I can get no information except that the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs is now considering the matter. But it seems pretty certain that Weil of luft Hansa has not succeeded as yet in getting any concession. He. I should explain, has transferred his allegiance. Junkers intending to Stick to aircraft construction in future; if butt Hansa operated out here, they would take over Junkers' planes and organisation, so it really comes to the same think. If he or some other company got a concession for internal Persian services it would undoubtedly be necessary, if you wished your service established in Iraq, to run a branch service to Tehran, for some service established in Persia to be allowed in return to land in Baghdad. Tte cancellation of the Anglo-persian Oil Company conoessionconcession has* however 9 produced a situation in which it is most improbable that a visit from you would do any good* I should certainly not be in a position to help* Moreover* Teymourtache is under a cloud* though as he seems to have left civil aviation almost entirely to the Minister of posts and 0 ?elegraphs s that is not perhaps of great importance* In the circumstances I think your best course is to set the wheels moving through the Iraqi Government. If your branch in Iraq is now registered as an Iraqi Company and is likely to become an Iraq or Government-owned company at that, that is, I suppose, the proper course, though prior to the Anglo-persian Oil company business X should have had no hesita tion in doing all I could to secure permission for you to land in Tehran. Once the Anglo-Porsian Oil Company business has blown over I may be able to assist again, but there is no way of telling when that will be.

WITH reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of my despatch No. 408 of the 24th September regarding the possibility of acquiring an aeroplane for the conveyance of the Legation mails, I have the honour to inform you that Mr. Weil recently told the military attache that he had definitely severed his connexion with the Junkers Company, and was now an employee of Luft Hansa. Junkers will not run any more air services, but will concentrate on construction. Luft Hansa are prepared to take over Junkers’ aeroplanes, which have been standing idle on the aerodrome since the service closed down last March, and to run a service between Bagdad and Tehran, and possibly between Tehran, Meshed and Kabul. They do not want to operate subsidiary lines in Persia, but will do so, if necessary, on a subsidised basis. 2. Mr. Weil indicated to Colonel Dodd that, much against his will, he had been rather drawn into the outer currents of the Teymourtache versus Taghizadeh feud. He had intended approaching the Minister of Court personally, as he had always done in the past, with a view to securing a contract with the Persian Government, but Taghizadeh had instructed him to negotiate with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. Mr. Weil had concluded that Teymourtache no longer had the power to negotiate a final contract, and that his powers would be further curtailed as the result of disclosures on the subject of the National Bank which Dr. Lindenblatt was expected to make. 3 . I do not know what importance to attach to Mr. Weil’s conclusions. The general manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia is inclined to think that Dr. Lindenblatt, though probably responsible for definite irregularities, is astute enough to emerge more or less unscathed from the present investigations, and if he does so it seems to me doubtful whether there will be any sensational revelations. 4 . As regards air matters, a reference to my despatch No. 355 of the 29th July show's that many months ago Teymourtache was disposed to leave to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs the conduct of any discussions with foreign firms. ' 5 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 226), His Majesty’s Minister at Bagdad (No. 115), and His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul (No. 106 M.).

I questioned Teymourtaohe and he replied definitely that there was little or no prospect of civil aviation in Persia being considered until the autumno 2c, The situation has, however, been modified by the return to Persia some ten days ago of Mr c Weii of ^unkei a So It is believed that the Luft Hansa Company have taken over the liabilities of Junkers and there is every reason to believe that Mr. Weil has initiated negotiations with the Persian Government for tha resumption of an air service. 3. In these circumstances it appeared desirable to ascertain what impression Mr. Muntz’ proposals had made 0 Teymourtache nas been indisposed for some little time and iia is now away at the eoac The Commercial Secretary has, however, enquired of the Minister of Pest a and Telegraphs and learned from him that Tcymoutache never passed them on to him.

Section 4. [E 2038/40/34] Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—[Received April 26.) [No. 174.) ir Tehraon, April 4, 1932. WITH reference to Mr. Baggallay’s telegrams Nos. 46 and 47 of the 25th and 26th March, regarding the withdrawal of the Junkers Company from Persia, I have the honour to inform you that on Thursday, the 24th March, Herr Auerbach, the acting manager of the company in Tehran, received a telegram instructing him to close down immediately unless the Persian Govern ment agreed to make good the present monthly deficits. These instructions coincided with the receipt of Reuters and other press messages, dated the 23rd March, announcing that the Junkers Company in Germany had been forced to seek a composition with their creditors and it was understood that the latter had insisted upon the immediate cessation of all unprofitable enterprises. Of these, the service in Persia is one, recent monthly losses being estimated at nearly Court and Posts and Telegraphs informing them of his instructions and intimating that he must receive a reply by the following morning. At the same time he issued to the press a communique, of which I enclose a copy taken from the “ Messager de Teheran ” of the 25th March. 3. On the morning of the 25th March, the acting manager stated that he had received no reply from the Persian Government, and that although he had agreed to wait for a reply until the evening of the 26th March, he had personally no hope of a favourable solution. If the reply were unfavourable, no further aeroplanes would leave Tehran on passenger and other flights, though such aeroplanes as were then absent would return according to schedule. On the evening of the 26th March he stated positively that the service was definitely closing down. 4. The suddenness of the decision may be gauged from the fact that during Saturday, the 26th March, the Persian post offices were accepting payment for letters to be sent by air mail to Bagdad the following morning, entirely oblivious of the fact that it was in the highest degree improbable that any aeroplane would leave Tehran. 5. If permission can be obtained from the Soviet Government, the aero planes will be sent home by train across the Soviet Union, being flown to P'ahlavi and thence along the coast to Baku. The aeroplane chartered by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company will remain behind until the end of the year, and a very much reduced workshop will be maintained at the Tehran aerodrome. 6. According to the counsellor of the German Legation, there was still a faint chance a few days ago of the service continuing, though personally he had no hope. This apparently depended upon the creditors altering their decision in the hope of future profits, rather than on any change in the position here. Herr Meyer stated that neither the German Legation nor the acting manager were aware of the difficulties of the parent company and he considered that it was very unfortunate that they were not kept informed. Herr Weil, the manager, might have known, but he was in Germany. If the service had to be withdrawn, the obvious time to withdraw it was when the contract ended in February. Nevertheless, the company were lucky to be able to go at a moment’s notice, being bound by no contract. 7. The absence of a contract has in this case recoiled upon the head of the Persian Government, who may be assumed to be considerably annoyed not only at the practical inconvenience to their mails and communications, but also at being made to look foolish in the eyes of other countries It is worth mentioning that Sur Israfil, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, resigned (or was forced £1,000. 2. The acting manager immediately addressed letters to the Ministers of [443 cc—4]MBmmm » ■ ^ 2 to resign) at midday on the 26th March, though this may have been for reasons unconnected with Junkers. 8. There has, naturally, been much speculation as to what arrangements the Persian Government will make to replace Junkers. One theory is that they will try to make Imperial Airways follow the line Bagdad-Tehran-Bushire, or, failing that, provide a feeder service to cover these two lines, let the Soviet Government run the line from Pahlavi to Tehran and hand the remaining lines to the Persian Air Force, who would carry mails only until the pilots became more experienced and public confidence were gained. Another is to the effect that a Irench company will buy the Junkers aeroplanes and carry on the service as a going concern. If so, the French concern must act quickly, as the aeroplanes are leaving almost immediately. . . . 9. My predecessors have frequently expressed their admiration of the efficiency and reliability of the Junkers’ service, which has been carried on for five years in the face of immense climatic and geographical difficulties and of much official obstruction, and with the indispensable minimum of staff and ground organisation. I think I may say that this admiration is shared by every European in Persia and by many Persians, and that regret at their departure is universal. Junkers have maintained to the end their record of having never injured a passenger or lost a bale of goods. It is a pioneering achievement of which any air service might be proud and one which deserved a better fate. 10. \ am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, at Bagdad (No. 45), the Government of India (No. 76), ana the Honourable, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire (No. 59). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. p.S. Since writing the above despatch I have learned that some difficulty has arisen with regard to the conveyance of the aeroplanes across the Soviet Union. In consequence, the staff of the company will return by road and rail and the aeroplanes themselves will be left in Tehran with one or two mechanics m charge. 2. This will apparenth cause the company a great deal of inconvenience, but it is also possible that the explanations given to me are not correct, and that the aeroplanes are really being left with a view to their purchase by some other concern. „ ^ TT TT Enclosure in No. 1.

A protracted dispute between the Teheran Government and the Junkers Aircraft Works, which has performed such signal service in Persia, has ended with the unfortu nate cessation of the Company’s Persian lines. This step has followed as a corollary of the financial difficulties of the German firm, which preclude them from carrying on any activity not actually earning a profit, but the fact remains that the Persian Government had failed to con clude an agreement with the Junkers Company for a new concession after the expiry of the five years' contract made in 1927. One point in the dispute turned on the question whether Junkers had carried out their undertaking to train young Persians in aviation; but it seems difficult to believe that the I eheran Government really intended to deprive the country of the advantages derived from aerial com munication between distant towns. The loss of the facilities provided by these services cannot fail to be serious for Persia, and it will be of interest to note what effect, if any, the withdrawal of the Junkers Company will have on the negotiations between the Persian Government and Imperial Airways. The agreement which allows British mail aeroplanes on the India route to use landing grounds on the eastern shore of the Persian Gulf holds good only until May 31, and as it was by no means certain that the Persian Government would renew the agreement, unless Imperial Airways consent to fly over the interior of Persia, the possibility of the Indian air services having to be transferred to the western side of the Gulf was under contemplation. It may be that the elimination of the German lines will make the Teheran Government all the more insistent on securing what advantage it can from the Indian mail service; but Imperial Airways will hardly be more anxious now than they were previously to lengthen J; the Indian route.14-6130 6353 (2) A r *XED In any futther communication on this subject, please quote y n ■ and address —not to any person by name, but to “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. i f\ r &gt;&lt;.

He is on hia way home and will be absent about three months, lie has extracted from the Persians an under taking that Junkers shall continue to fly until he gets back and that they will resume negotiations with him, in regard to which he is unoptimlstic, on his return. He told me that Teymourtache was very Insistent that Junkers should out up a factory in Persia; Te.ymourtache was at first Incredulous when Weil told him that the coat would be quite prohibitive. 1.1. was, however, shaken, and ooscibly convinced, when Tell told him that Junkers built planes in Russia at one time for the ovlet Government on quite a large scale - at least ten times as large as anything; that would be required here - and that the cost of these .ovietic planes was five and a half times what it would have been had they been built In Germany. Weil said that he gathered that the &gt;hah*s idea apparently was that flying in Persia should be restricted to those countries who were ore oared to build in ’ersia / for internal service: I said: ”1 suppose he is expecting an offer from you, us, the french and the dutch to set up a combined factory at Bushire *.

I HAVE the honour to refer to my despatch No. 694 of the 9th December u - last, and to transmit, herewith, a copy of a minute recording a conversation that the military attache to this Legation had recently with Herr Weil, the representative of Herren Junkers in this country. 2. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to 'His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. No. 1. January 19, 1932. Section 3. Enclosure in No. 1 Minute by Military Attache, Tehran. His Majesty's Minister, 1 SAW M. Weil, manager of Junkers Company in Persia, yesterday, and he gave me the following information :— E H e is making all arrangements to quit Persia. He has notified agencies to book no passengers after January 1932, and all material for his service in Persia, such as spare parts, has been stopped en route, at Bombay, Mohammerah, Ac., for return to Dessau. Under present arrangements, the last ’plane will leave Tehran for Bagdad on the 31st January, 1932, and will not return. 2. As regards the chances of Junkers’ obtaining an extension of contract for their service in Persia : Negotiations are suspended pending the return of Teymourtache. M. Weil was shown, on the 20th December, an'official telegram in which Teymourtache states that he will be back in Persia on the 5th Januarv. The Persian authorities have prepared a note regarding Junkers’ service to put up to Teymourtache on his return. M. Weil understands that this note favours an extension being granted to Junkers. I asked M. Weil about our bag, and he could only advise waiting until Teymourtache returns, which is what M. Weil is doing himself. 3. The following are the three points on which Junkers are insisting. Other matters, such as the establishment of an aviation school, training of pilots. &amp;c can, it is thought, be easily and amicably arranged (i) An Extension of Contract for at least Ten Years. Nothing short of ten years will be economically profitable. If an extension is obtained, the present aircraft, types J.13 and W.33, will be replaced by a type such as the T .52, with 850-h.p. Armstrong £ Leopard engine, lifting a payin°' load of 3 to 4 tons. This change in aircraft will cost Junkers a considerable outlay, not only the cost of the new aeroplanes, but also exporting old parts and importing new spares and material for the larger aeroplanes. M. Weil explained that at present his company are in a strong position as no other organisation is ready to carry on his air service. Should he take a shorter contract, say, for three years, with the hope of renewing ao'ain for a fuithei period, by that time the Persian Government might have arranged a suitable rival. 1 5 Only on one condition will Junkers consider a shorter contract, and that is if the Persian Government will join them in partnership, furnishing 49 per cent of the capital, and taking a like percentage of the profit or loss involved. [ 362 t—3]7~ t-— {ii) A Minimum Gucmuntee of 40 kilog. of Postal Material per Plight. At present, sometimes not more than 3 or 4 kilog. of post are carried to Baku, Pahlavi and Bushire. (iii) No Limitation to amount of Post Carried. At present the Government take, without incurring any expense, A.a ordinary postage on air mails, and the company the air surtax charged, ihe Government wished to limit Junkers’ profits under this arrangement by sharing the air surtax charge on postal material over 40 kilog. Junkers, with their larger machines, hope to carry heavier loads, and will not agree to any limitations of their profits in this respect, which really only affects the Bagdad line. 4. If M. Weil cannot get an extension of contract, he is exploring the possibilities of utilising for his purpose the Convention internationale de Navigation aerienne. He believes that Iraq, Persia and Afghanistan have all joined this convention, under the terms of which he could fly over Persian territory from Bagdad to Herat. He thinks that if he can establish air lines in Iraq and Afghanistan, joined by a transit service across Persia, he would get permission to land mails and passengers at Tehran en route. Junkers' Extension to Afghanistan {via Herat-Kandahar to Kabul). The Afghan Ambassador in Persia says that he has full powers from his Government to sign a contract with M. Weil. These two are discussing details daily, and a draft agreement in English has been prepared and is under discussion in Tehran. / Persian Air Force. As we know, an order for fourteen Trench Potez machines was recently sanctioned and then cancelled, as it was considered advisable to give the Swedes an opportunity to provide aircraft to be paid for in Persian raisins. The Swedes, having no aircraft works of their own, could only get in touch with Junkers at Dessau, who, of course, informed M. Weil. Bad relations exist between the Persian authorities and Junkers, and M. Weil made the most of the above facts on a visit to the Ministry of War. The Potez manufacturers have prepared the ground carefully in Persia; M. Challe, their representative, is said to have spent 8,000 tomans in bribes during a recent flying visit to Tehran, and an order for some fifteen Potez aircraft is almost certain to be placed shortly. The military authorities are waiting to see if anything comes of a hint from the Soviet that they might supply aircraft on long-term credits, or, in other words, practically gratis. P. C. B.

WITH reference to Mr. Charles Dodd's despatch No. 580 of the 17th October last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a minute by Mr. Dodd recording a recent conversation with the local representative of Messrs. Junkers regarding his negotiations with the Persian Government. 2. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq at Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Dodd. I SAW Weil by chance on the 26th November, and asked him how his negotiations with the Persian Government for a renewal of the Junkers concession were progressing. I asked especially what were, in fact, the points in dispute. If Junkers were running at a loss, was it not they who would wish the concession to die rather than the Persian Government, who were in the enviable position of having at their disposal an unremunerative service ? z Weil said that it was difficult to fix any points in dispute. Junkers were willing to grant all the desiderata put forward by the Persian Government; when any desideratum was granted, the Persian Government turned volte-face, e.y., in the case of the Aviation School . The Persian Government interpreted the terms of the concession to mean that the Persian Government should provide the installation and Junkers the running expenses. Junkers took the reverse view— that Junkers should provide the installation and the Persian Government the running expenses. They were willing, however, to adopt the Persian Govern ment’s interpretation, provided, of course, that the running expenses did not exceed the bounds of reason. Even then the Persian Government would not settle. Junkers offered the arbitration provided in the concession as obligatory. The Persian Government refused this. Similarly, the Persian Government cast doubts on the protests of Junkers as to their losses. Junkers proposed that, if the Persian Government really thought there were profits, the Persian Government or the Shah should take up 50 per cent, of the shares. The Persian Government declined, on the ground that they should not be expected to share Junkers' losses. Weil explained that Junkers must have a long contract, in order to have time to ( their losses. They would like forty years, 'but would content themselves with twenty or even fifteen years. They would then bring into use the new type of aircraft, the U.52, with Armstrong-Siddeley engine. The present machines with 500-600 kilog. useful weight could never pay in Persia. The U.52 machine with a 3-ton useful weight could pay. Its running expenses were, about the same as those of a 3-ton lorry, with which it could compete successfully owing to the great excess of speed. All that they required was a guaranteed minimum load of freight and mails. As it is, their mails are usually insignificant now. ^ One of these machines was on its way out to Persia, but Weil had it turned back in Turkey. Fifty per cent, of his personnel have been dismissed; no spare parts are coming out from Germany; consignments arrived at Mohammerah are being left there. The running of even the reduced services in these circumstances [362 d—3]2 is very difficult. He is, in fact, acting on the assumption that Junkers will clear out of the country on the expiry of the concession. Even if this were renewed to-day, it would take six months for the services to get back into real working Junkers were very keen on getting the school. Pilots trained on one type of aircraft always liked flying that type, which would be profitable for Junkers. Weil had even proposed that the question of the school should be treated as a separate concern from the services concession. This the Persian Government had also refused To sum up, Junkers and the Persian Government have no real differences. The Persian Government are unable to reach a decision. It is the old story of indecision bred of ignorance and suspicion. the Persian Government do not recognise a perfect service, even when they ll3 ’ and are continually suspecting that they are being defrauded m ways which they cannot detect. In so far as the foreign service is more efficient than anything Persian, they are jealous on grounds of amour-propre, and they feel the savage impulse to destroy. Bribery might overcome these reluctances and passions, but that only leads to increased appetite later on, blackmail and endless trouble. I understand that Junkers are tired of bribing. vy. J-J.

Above may be of interest to Airways as question does not appear to concern Junkers particularly. My own view, repeatedly expressed, is that if Air ways can avoid Persia altogether they will be well ad vised to do so. Addressed to Foreign Office. Sent to India, Bushire No. 43.COPY Mo. 256.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith copies of a report 'by the Military Attach^ at this Legation setting forth the substance of a conversation with Herr well, the Tehran Manager of the Junkers Company. 2. I learn from another source that the new conditions imposed 'by the Persian Government on the Meshed line (referred to in paragraph 1 of Colonel Dodd’s report) consisted in the reduction, by no less than three fifths, of the postal surcharges accruing to the Company. It seems not improbable that the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs found the admirably regular air service too serious a competitor for the far from efficient telegraph administration. 3. My telegram Mo. 92 of April 27th will already have apprised you of the general tenour of the warning which Herr veil claims to have conveyed to the Persian Government in connection with the new route prescribed for Imperial Airways Limited* I see no reason to doubt his statement, for if the Junkers Company have little cause to assist Imperial Airways, they have much to gain by remaining in The Right Honourable A rthur Mender son, M.

Lt* '“Colonel, Military Attache His Majesty’s Minister Tehran,The following information was obtained in coarse of a recent conversation with Herr Veil* Manager of Junkers Company in Persia* 1* The Company have closed down the Tehran - Meshed service. This line is not part of the original contract with the Persian Government and is not paying under the conditions newly imposed by the Government, chiefly in connection with profits accruing from postage surcharges. The pilot on this line has for some months past been a Persian trained by the Company. The weekly service between Tehran and Bushire via Isfahan and Shiraz has been modified to a single return flight per week. It is not proposed at present to reduce the service between Tehran and Baghdad. The Junkers original five year contract in Persia expires next February and the terms for renewal are now under discussion. The Company are having considerable difficulties with the Persian Government in this connection but there is every prospect that the contract will eventually be renewed. A new type of single engined Junkers monoplane, U* 52, is being sent out from Dessau in June. This type has a carrying capacity of 2»'|f tons and a cabin to scat 20 persons. It will be sent to Persia but is primarily intended for service in Iraq.. 2. There are no new developments in the Persian Air Force. The Company continue to have trouble in the matter of establishing a flying school in Tehran. This was in the terms of their contract with the Persian Government, definitely a school for civil pilots, but the military authorities insisted in interfering and creating difficulties with the result that the school had not yet been established. The ChiefGiiief of Staff had approached the Company with a proposal that they should train 60 pilots annually, for military service, on a five year contract* This suggestion was not taken very seriously a© it was difficult to helleve that the Persian Government really required to turn out S00 trained pilots in five years. It appears that the demonstration of foreign aircraft, about which so much was heard last year, is not after all, to be held this spring. The hoviet wished to send a flight to Tehran this month but were informed that they should not do so unless they could demonstrate a new type of aircraft. 5. Mr. Well is freely consulted by the Persian Government regarding air matters. On the question of Imperial Airways route across Persia he expressed the view, to the Minister of Court and others, that the most difficult route possible had been selected. If this was the only alternative the Government might ^uat as well forbid Imperial Airways to fly in Persia at all. He warned them that a 4 engined aircraft is now available which can fly non-stop from Basra to Karachi. This could fly 5 miles from the Persian coast at a height sufficient to make the land in case of emergency. It is international custom that in case of a forced landing, the aircraft must receive certain facilities# So he warned the Persian officials that for fear of a complete boycott it would be inadvisable to insist on such a difficult route. The Junkers Company in Persia have been asked to grant facilities to two members of the staff of Imperial Airways for the pur ose of surveying a central flying route aerose Persia. 4* The negotiations for the extension of the present Junkers air service in Persia to Kabul are still continuing. TheThe Afghan Government approve of an air service in principle hut up to the present are not prepared to grant Junkers Company the minimum guarantee required* The Company are purposely not asking for a subsidy hut require a guarantee of a minimum income until the service is well established# Should the Afghan Government he unable to grant a monetary guarantee, the Company is prepared to take, in lieu, some form of concession such as larah skins which they can sub-let to a German firm in Kabul* Mr* Weil points out th. t the ; fgh&amp;n Government require a regular air service and stipulates that a thoroughly efficient workshop for complete overhaul of aircraft must be established In Kabul, but are not ready to contribute anytuing towards the heavy expenses involved* Mr* 1 ell, accompanied by Mr* Thomas Brown, proposes to fly to Kabul from Tehran in June with the hope of concluding a satisfactory agreement. 5. Mr* ,eil has just returned from a visit to Baghdad. His object was to study local conditions and to approach the authorities on the question of Junkers Company establishing an air service from Baghdad to Damascus (Aleppo- Haifa) and Baghdad to the Hedju:s. lie had interview with King Pel sal and the High Commissioner to whom he only mentioned the question of the Baghdad - Damascus line. He considered it unsound, on political grounds, to mention the Hejaz line as he visualises an Arab state, or states, centred on Baghdad - Damascus - Mecca, linked by Junkers air service, and he was uncertain whether this vision would appeal to the Iraq authorities. During his stay in Baghdad Mr* Weil made preliminary arrangements for establishing a local company to be called the Iraq Transport Company. Junkers take 51k of the shares, the public 25D, and the remainder will be offered to the British. With an eye to the future it is being arrangedas far a&amp; possible that the public ©bares will be offered to Iraqis of every creed so that a political upheaval will not necessarily ruin the Company* Mr* Haim and other transport agents in Iraq and Syria appear to 'iiave taken great interest in the new Iraq Iranaport Gonpany. Mr* v.eil is quite certain that Junkers aircraft, tyoe 11*52 can compete successfully with any fora of ground transport for goods or passengers in a desert service. 6. Mr. sell asked regarding an experimental flight from • : * India over the • arakoram range to Chinese lurkv^stan* he understood that a Uolonel Stewart was undertaking this flight in a Yietrix m whine. I had no information and Mr* Weil went on to say that the Germans had for a long time wanted to establish a line from Baghdad to India via Persia ~ Afghanistan and on to China over the Karakoram range via Clitaeae Turkestan* fliia scheme he has often mentioned to me before* (ad* ) Lt*-Golonel, Military Attaehd.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS SRI^ANl flc MAJESTY’S GOVE RNMENT 2 ‘ PERSIA.

Bu ■ his negotiations now embrace the larger question of the extension or rescission of the company’s contract, which comes to an end next February, and m spite of the wholly admirable quality of the services rendered by Junkers during the past years in the development of Persian communications, it is evident that a pro longation of the contract is by no means a foregone conclusion. , M , 2 I enclose herein a translation of an article which appealed a ^hort wh ao-o in the “ Ittila’at,” a Tehran evening paper; there can be no doubt but that this article was officially inspired, and it is, indeed, characteristic of the methods employed bv the Persian Government, who habitually make use of a press which they allege^to be free of any but an “ eliminatory ” control m their efforts to influence foreign firms engaged on contract work in this country. Herr admits the inspired nature of this article, but professes to be not much perturbed 3. P It cannot be denied that the company are still very far from having carried out all the obligations incumbent on them by virtue of their contract. No three-engined machines have as yet made their appearance m Persia and nothing has been done to establish either an aviation school or a Persian aviation company. The question of the aviation school would appear to constitute at present the chief stumbling-block in the way of a satisfactory settlement; Herr Weil estimates the cost of establishing such a school at some 80,000 tomans, and is naturally arixious to postpone the moment for embarking on this costly enterprise until the financial situation of the company has improved. It seems, moreover, that both the company and the Persian air force insist on controlling the school when it is finally brought into being, and neither side is ready to give way over this important point. Relations between the company and the air force are habitually strained, and both the German Minister and Herr Weil have received, from Teymourtache and the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs respectively, unmistakable hints to the effect that an extension will be secured only if matters can be “ arranged ” with the military authorities. The latter have before now contrived to make capital out of their position; two years ago, Herr Weil informs me they received from him 6,000 tomans’ worth of spare parts, and he has information to the effect that this material is entered in the air force books as having been duly paid for, though the company has never received a kran for it. It is now a standino 1 rule with Junkers that no special aeroplane chartered by the military may leave the ground until the fare has actually been received, and Herr Weil declares that he will leave the country rather than resort to bribery to obtain a renewal of the contract. ' . _ , , ,, 4. Rumours have of late been current m Tehran to the enect that the Persian Government have received an offer of £10,000 for the supplanting of the Junkers Company by a French contractor. The French Minister informs me, however, that no negotiations are in progress m this connexion, and that the [254 d—2]forthcoming visit of a French military air squadron to Tehran will in reality be an exercise planned without any such ulterior motive. It is certain that the Shah has a prejudice against French aviation owing to the failure of the last French air mission, and Herr Weil, who estimates his own chances of securing a renewal of the contract at a little over 50 per cent., is of the opinion that if he should fail, the windfall is more likely to be secured by an Italian firm than by a French one. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for Iraq. &lt; I have, &amp;c. CHARLES DODD. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the “ Ittild-dt ” of August 2, 1931 (Translation.) The Junkers Contract. THE prospective renewal of the contract granted by the Government to the Junkers Company gives us occasion to set forth our views on this question. We hope that the authorities will receive them in the same impartial and unbiased spirit in which they are given : — Desiring to introduce all the latest improvements into the country, the Government took steps to create a system of aerial posts in Persia. This gave rise to a competition between French and German aviation companies, which was won in Bahman 1304 by the Germans, who offered the best terms. Those who had the progress of Persia at heart welcomed this event, and the papers described the inauguration of an aerial post as a useful step in the advancement of the new Persia. The concession was granted for five years, and it will therefore come to an end in Bahman of this year (sometime in February 1932). It may be as well, at this stage, briefly to review the history of this concession, in order to ascertain whether the contracting company has fulfilled its contractual obligations and to determine whether the renewal of its contract is genuinely in the advantage of Persia. Before proceeding to answer these questions we must give the directors of the company their due and testify to their proficiency and technical and scientific qualifications. They have done much to gain the public confidence, and their aeroplanes have suffered hardly a casualty. We do not therefore wish to call in question the safety, comfort, speed or solidity of their machines. We are also glad to be able to say that notwith standing the hot climate of our country and its peculiar meteorological conditions, their aeroplanes have fully proved their worth so that the various types of accident so frequent, even in Europe, have seldom occurred in this country. Having said this, we must, however, state that where its own advantage was not concerned the contracting company has seldom stopped to consider the vital interests of this country in matters to which we attach the utmost importance, and this, though the Persian Government have always taken great care to safeguard the company's interests, and have even gone so far as to exempt the petrol and lubricating oil used by the company from customs dues. The company undertook by virtue of section (c) of article 8 of the concession— To establish a technical aviation school and import instructional aeroplanes for the training of Persian pilots and mechanics. Section (d) of the same article runs : — The admission by the company into its various institutions of two Persian students at a time, throughout the period of the contract, for instruction at the expense of the company in all branches of aviation. Section (/) of the same article The formation of a Persian aviation company in accordance with Persian law.Section (h) of the same article :— The use by the company throughout the period of the concession of a number of large aeroplanes with three engines and the use, if necessary, of one such machine immediately after the sanction and granting of this concession. The Government had in mind to ensure that while others reaped the advantages of the contract, Persia should also benefit through an arrangement by which she should eventually be able to count on a number of trained Persian pilots and air mechanics. They wished to bring about the establishment of an aviation school, the training of two Persian students at a time in the various branches of the company and the formation of an aviation company with at least half of the shares held by Persians. None of these obligations, though legally binding on the company, have been put into effect, and it is the company which is responsible for the fact that advantages which should have accrued five years ago to Persia still remain in abeyance. One wonders whether it is really expedient that the concession should be renewed with a company which regards with total indifference the interests of the Government which granted it. From the legal point of view the answer is in the negative, unless indeed the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, who enjoys a merited reputation as a competent official and an energetic supporter of Persian interests, is fully satisfied that the company will turn over a new leaf and will henceforth fulfil scrupulously its obligations and safeguard Persian interests. Confident as we are that the present Government never adopts an obstructive attitude towards any measure conducive to the public welfare, we cannot but attribute the indifference displayed towards these unfulfilled obligations to the company and not to the Government, and we therefore repeat that unless the interests in question are safeguarded, the concession should not be renewed to Junkers. We consider that it is in the interests of our country that at the present stage when the contract has still five months to run, this hint should be given to the Government, in order that when the time comes to consider the renewal more attention may be paid to the moral and material interests of the Persian people.— — - IS~ f imunication on this subjecy please q’ £J?JV7V/Jt not to a&gt;fy perscm oy natjie, but to— In any further communication on th^s subjecy please quote No. ^ and address —not “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i INDIA DIRECT tr.M '* 633 6 OID THE Under-Seoretary of State for Foreign Affaire present^iia J compliments to ^ and, by direction of the'Secretary of State, transmits herewith copcf^ of the under-mentioned paper.

Sir, I have the honour to report that the Junkers So. have recently inaugurated a weekly aeroplane service between Tehran and Meshed. Two 4-seater monoplanes arrived at Meshed on 27th October and brought 6 or 7 passengers. One left the following morning for Tehran with 2 passengers. The other remained at Meshed on 28th Octooer and with a view to advertising the service and accustoming Persians to aerial travel took up passengers for 5 minute flights at 3 Tomans a seat; no less than 104 passengers availed themselves of this opportunity of going up in an aeroplane. It left on the 29th October but without passengers. 2. The following Thursday, i.e. 3rd Hovember a 7-seater monoplane arrived with 5 passengers. On the 4th Hovember it took up 73 passengers for 5 minute flights, and loft on the 5th Hovember with 4 passengers. It carried a mail doth ways. 3. The representatives of the Junkers Go. have expressed considerable satisfaction with the prospects of this line, they state that on the Tehran-Tabriz line they only get very occasional passengers, whereas they anticipate that on the Meshed-Tehran line the number of passenger^ will be much larger. The journey by road from Tehran to Meshed takes 4 days by car* the hire of a car hosts £ 30; and the road is Confidential . Ho. 56. Sir Robert Glive, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the court of Persia, TEHRhH.is extremely bad, even for Persia, and in winter it is frequently impassible. On the other hand the journey from Tehran to Tabriz I understand only takes about 2 days, the road is better and rates lower, while owing to the very large number of pilgrims that visit Meshed there are probably many mpre travellers to this place than there are to Tabriz. •v Finally the Company have hitherto been carrying passengers at extremely low rates, and have only been charging £ 7 or £ 8 for a journey of nearly 600 miles. It is therefore much cheaper for say a couple of’travellers of the wealthier class who in the ordinary course would have hired a car, to travel themselves by aeroplane and to send their heavy luggage by lorry than to travel by car, and they accomplish the journey in about 6 hours instead of 4 days. The aeroplanes come down at Maiamai, which is ahnost exactly naif way between Meshed and Tehran to refuel. The Company intend if possible to main tain a regular service of one aeroplane a week during the winter, when as mentioned above the road is frequently im passable, and to send additional aeroplanes whenever a suffi ciency of passengers offer; the post office are already sending letters by aeroplane and the Company are endeavouring to obtain a regular contract for the carriage of mails.

He is of opinion that Russians will do their best to place obstacles in the way of such extension, and to foster Termex route instead. Information received from other sources is that Persian Junker Company are stipulating that, if service is to be extended to Kabul, Afghanistan should guarantee cost of two multi~engined machines, but that Afghanistan is not willing to afford the money.

The views of the Air Council are as follows:- Article I in effect gives the Company a monopoly for the commercial carriage of persons and &amp;oods on the routes specified, it is also clear that, although the question of the nationality oi the aiiciaft appear^ to he left entirely open, the Company retains its G e rman natio na1ity. Article 39 seems to contemplate arrangements enabling the Company to operate the services with air craft of nominal Persian nationality in spite of M. Jarolimek's professed ignorance of the purpose under- 1 lying this Article. It would be difficult to argue that this was contrary to Hie International Air Con vention, but, as matters stand, the grant of this monopoly to a German Company without a stipulation tnat the aircraft must be of Persian nationality does, in the opinion of the Air Council, infringe Article 16 of the Convention. They have therefore suggested that you should point out to the Persian government that the grant to Hie Company of a monopoly over the routes specified in the contract appears incompatible with their international• 2 - international obligations under the Air Convention, and that in view of -Article 44 of the contract, His Majesty’s Government assume that it is not the in tention 01 the Persian government to concede such exclusive rights to the German Company but would like an assurance on the point. I am advised, however, that Article 16 of the Air Convention is 'Permissive” and does not prohibit anything. In these circumstances it would in my opinion be fundamental mistake to put our case too nign by arguing that there is a distinct violation of Article 13 of Convention, which is distressingly vague. iUx oner, Air Council think action in this matter aiigho react unfavourably on question of southern air route and will not press for representations if politically undesirable.

PERSIA Oevelopment of Commercia.1 Aviation# Terms of contract witii Junker Company for monopoly of (transport of goods and persons, FOR INFORMATION. Sir R.Clive’s despatch of 21st February was written before the Persian opposition to Imperial Airways cressing Persia on the naghdad- —Karachi route developed its present acute iorin# He here questions whether the monopoly of aerial transport given to the Junker Company is compat- _ible with Persia’s obligations under the Inter- -national Aerial Transport Convention, but it has since turned out that Persia has not yet definitely recognised her obligations under this Convention. It will be noted that for the time being two routes are contemplated, namely (1) Tehran- Kermanshah I Mm HI”I 1 —iV ermanshah-Iraq anc^Tahran-Bushire. The former was to have started on 5th March, tout would obviously, have been Impeded by the lack of a landing ground on the Persian side of the I rac, frontier at Khaniqin. In a recent telegram relating to the Baghdad- aracui route oontro I I -versy Sir P.Cli e was authorised by His Majesty's ^jovernment to hold out hopes of the Junker Company being allowed to land their passengers and mails on the Iraq side of the frontier, as an inducement towards the adoption by the Persian Government of a more reasonable attitude towards Imperial Airways. The present despatch explains what was not clear from the telegraphic correspondence, namely that the Persian uovernment had reached an understanding with the Junker Company on terms which appeared more profitable than the fulfillment of their obligations under the internat ional Convention by permitting a British owned line to fly across Persia without being; domiciled in the country.

Jarolimek, of the agreement recently concluded between the Junkers Aviation Company and the Persian Government by virtue of the Bill approved uy the Majlis a year ago, a copy of which was forwarded to you with my predecessoi s despatch No. 88 of the 11th February, 1926. 2. In that Bill the Government was authorised to grant to the company a monopoly of aviation on three specified routes, and in accordance with the instructions conveyed in your despatch No. 171 of the 14th April, Sir Percy Loraine addressed to the Persian Government a note, a cop} 7- of which was enclosed in his despatch No. 219 of the 7th May, asking for an assurance that this ‘‘monopoly of aviation” would not entail the prohibition of flight by aircraft of other nationalities. To that note no reply was received; but it will be observed that the first article of the agreement now made with the company limits the monopoly to the carriage for hire of goods and persons. Even this appears to be an infringement of the International Convention for Aeiial Navigation, as it can apparently not be held that the aircraft of the Junkers Company are Persian national aircraft. It is, in fact, quite plain that the company retains its German nationality. I beg that in due course I may be instructed whether I am to call the attention of the Persian Government to this apparent breach of their international obligations, which, it will be noticed, are specially safeguaided by article 44. 3, Articles 8 and 27 are of special interest in view of the request of the Junkers Company to be allowed to fly to Bagdad. Their contract obliges them to begin the ! - operation of the line from Tehran via Kermanshah to the Iraq frontier within one month of its signature. Now there is no suitable landing-ground in the immediate vicinity of the frontier on the Persian side, and consequently, unless the company can obtain permission to fly to Iraq, it will be necessary to organise a system of transport for the carriage of mails and passengers from the landing-ground in Persian territory to the nearest Iraq post office or to railhead. A further reason for the anxiety of the company to fly to Bagdad is perhaps to be found in article 27, which obliges the company to link their Persian service up with an international line within three months. This can only be done at Bagdad or Baku; and, although a Russian service is talked of between Baku and Moscow, its inception by the specified date is doubtful. Meanwhile the company is in negotiation with the Soviet Ministry of Posts for the 4. Articles 31 to 35 give the conditions on which the company agrees to place its machines and personnel at the disposal of the Persian War Office in times of war or local crisis. I would refer you on this point to paragraph 4 of the Air Ministry’s letter of the 6th April, 1926, which was enclosed in your despatch No. 171 of the 14th April, and should be glad to learn whether, on further consideration, it is held that these conditions are an infringement of article 179 of the Treaty of Versailles. 5. Article 39 was, according to M. Jarolimek, inserted by the Persian Govern ment. He professes ignorance as to the purpose underlying the desire for the formation of a Persian company for commercial aviation, but states positively that it will not affect the status of the Junkers Company nor the conditions of their contract with the Persian Government. 6. I should add, in order to prevent any possible misunderstandiug, that the statement in paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 20 of the 13th February “that he (Jarolimek) does not intend to form a Persian company as latter would not have benefit of Capitulations,” refers only to the Junkers Company in Persia, and has no relation to article 39 of the contract.

Resume of the Principal Articles m the Agreement concluded between the Junkers Aviation Company and the Persian Government. Contract betweeyi the Junkers Company and the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on behalf of the Persian Government. , THE following are the principal points to be noted :— Article 1.- -Parliament originally authorised the grant of a monopoly of aviation to the Junkers Company on the three lines mentioned. We asked Persian Government for an explanation of this, as it seemed to conflict with Persia’s obligations under the ( International Convention for Aerial Navigation. The Persian Government did not reply, but the wording is changed in the present contract, which grants only a monopoly of aerial transport. A note is added that makes it quite clear that Junkers are given a monopoly of the carriage of passengers and merchandise. That seems to rule out the possibility of an international line being established by any company but Junkers along their three routes. Article 5.—The question of aerodromes is one of those that have been delaying the signature of the agreement. The War Office objected to their aerodromes being used. Junkers now agree to maintain their own aerodromes. If Government land is available they apparently get it rent free; otherwise they have to hire. Article 8. - The Tehran-Kermanshah-Iraq frontier line is to begin operation one month after the signature of the contract—about the 5th March. Tehran-Bushire does not begin until Government asks for it. Article II gives to the Persian Government the right to decide what passenger fares shall be. Article 14.—Weight of postal matter to be carried. Article 24.—Amount to be paid to the Junkers Company from the total accruing from the surtax, and Article 25, the amount of subsidy, are as specified by Parliament. Article 27 obliges the company to link up one of their Persian lines with an international line within three months from the date of signature of the agreement. This will presumably be either with the Russian company at Baku or Imperial Airways at Bagdad. Articles 31 to 35 give the conditions on which Junkers will place their pilots and personnel at the disposal of the War Office in time of war or “ local events.” Personnel have the option of refusing. Article 3b.—The aviation school. Junkers apparently set up the school with necessary machines and material. The Persian Government pays for the upkeep.

Loraine to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—(Received June 21 ) (No. 261.) Sir, Tehran, May 30, 1926. I HAVE the honour to inform you that V. Jarolimek, the Tehran representative of the Junkers Company, called on me on the 25th May to inform me of the progress made in his negotiations to settle the terms of the contract to be made between his company and the Persian Government on the basis of the Bill approved in February by Parliament, copy of which was transmitted to you with my despatch No, 88 of the 11th February. 2. M. Jarolimek submitted his draft contract on the 30th March and has since then been engaged in a maze of argument on every point. His chief difficulties have been the objection of the military authorities to the use of military aerodromes (there are no others in Persia) by Junkers aircraft, the obstructiveness of the Ministry of Finance, the insistence by the Persian members of the commission on their own estimates of the distances on which the subsidy is to be calculated, and the selection of the third member of the Court of Arbitration which is to decide disputes. All^ these difficulties, M. Jarolimek thinks, are in a fair way to being resolved. Ihe military authorities have agreed to allow their aerodromes to be used for six months, during which Government will provide the company with ground suitable for the construc tion of their own aerodromes; the Ministry of Finance has agreed to pay the subsidy for the two lines, Tehran—Pahlavi and Tehran—Guraitu (but pleads inability to subsidise the Tehran-Bushire line at present); and it is probable that it will eventually be agreed that the third member of the Court of Arbitration should be appointed by the Hague Court. 3. M. Jarolimek left with me copies of the draft contracts, drawn up by himself in the one case and the representatives of the Persian Government in the other, and he has promised to furnish me with a copy of the text in its final form when agreement has been reached. This I shall not fad to transmit to you. The draft contracts contain nothing on which it would be profitable to comment at this stage, but the following qualification in the Persian Government draft of the monopoly of aviation granted to the Junkers Company may be of interest as an indication of the attitude of the Persian Government to this question :— “ II est bien entendu que 1’aviation sur ces trois lignes reste fibre a I’egard des avions du Gouvernement imperial de Perse ainsi que des avions du sport ou autres qui arrivent des pays etrangers en Perse sans faire le commerce du transport des voyageurs, bagages ou marchandises, soit dans finterieur du pays soit au moment du retour,Jd Vexelusion des voyageurs, bagages et marchandises transportes par ces avions au moment d'arrivee, qui pourront voter en Perse sur les memes avions.' In the draft prepared by the Junkers Company the words in italics are omitted. I may here mention that I have not yet received a reply to the note I addressed to the Persian Government asking for an assurance on this point, copy of which was transmitted to you with my despatch No. 219 of the 7th May. 4. M. Jarolimek further informed me that he has made little progress in settling the terms of the agreement under which the material and personnel ot the Jlinkers Company will be placed at the disposal of the Persian War Office in times of crisis, in accordance with article 8 (a) of the Bill approved by Parliament (see enclosure to my despatch No. 88 of the 11th February). 5. M. Jarolimek gave me a brief outline of the present financial position of the company. It appears that in the crisis that occurred in December, to which reference was made in your telegram No. 255 of the 9th December, the German Government had insisted on taking over the larger proportion of the shares, against the wishes of the company, who had in view a more welcome arrangement with Vickers. The German Government had then introduced controllers into various departments of the business, whose interference has, according to M. Jarolimek, so seriously hampered [1321 x—1]the efficient execution of the company’s operations that another, and more serious, crisis occurred. The closing of the company’s factory and the abandonment of all Eastern enterprises were seriously considered. The latter was, M. Jarohmek believes, averted solely by the strong representations made by German representatives at Constantinople and Tehran regarding the damaging effect such a withdrawal would have on German prestige. M. Jarolimek understands that the financial situation is now easier; he has himself received a very welcome and long-overdue remittance f r- the local expenses of the company, and there is, he believes, now no question of closin^ the factory. He considers this may be the result of a more hopelul prospect of obtaining payment of a sum of 3,500,000 dollars which the company claims as indemnity from the Soviet Government on account of losses sustained in their Russian enterprises, against which, I understand, the company holds some form of guarantee from the Soviet.

I am now directed to call the attention of the Persian Government to the first clause of this Bill, which, in the version of the text in my possession, might be interpreted as conceding to the Junkers Company the sole right of flight along certain routes. I presume that the “monopoly of aviation” ceded to the Junkers Company does not entail the prohibition of flight by aircraft of other nationalities along the routes specified, and my Government would be glad to learn from the Imperial Government that this assumption is correct. It will certainly not have escaped the notice of the Imperial Persian authorities that the clause would otherwise be incompatible with the obligations accepted by Persia under the International Convention for Aerial Navigation.

On the other hand, to reserve all flight along these routes exclusively to aircraft of the Junkers Aviation Company would be a definite violation of her obligations under the convention. . 4.

Murphy, X.C., who had served as an officer in the Cloyal Air i'orcs during the 'Jar and subsequently resigned his commission to take up civil aviation in India, was concerned in the sale of 4 aeroplanes to the Afghan Government in 1924 * ' rhase Chinee were part of a consignment of aeroplanes and spare parts which the Government of India had received as a gift from His Majesty's Government and in turn had presented to the •C. Aviation Syndicate, Karachi, in 1920. The machines were not new when they came to India, and had been in storage at Karachi for four years, when the Company opened regulations for their disposal to the Afghan Government. On being approached with regard to the proposed sale, the Government of India caused the Afghan Government to be warned that the macnines were out of date, and unlikely to be of any use in Afghanistan. In spite of this warning the Afghan Government entered into a contract with Captain i’urphy for the purchase of the aeroplanes and advanced him a considerable proportion of the price of the machines. Captain Murphy agreed to despatch them by rail from Karachi to Peshawar, and thence to fly them to Kabul. Eventually during a severe storm at Peshawar one of the aeroplanes was completely wrecked, and two were badly damaged. Later on Captain Murphy personally applied for permission to fly to Kabul an Avro which he had sold to one Haji Muhammad Af za i Khan, a Kabuli merchant, for presentation to the Amir, but as theGovernment of India were advised that an Avro was unlikely to reach Kabul, the necessary permission and facilities were not granted. He then applied for permission to fly the machine to Jalalbad or in the alternative to be allowed to go to Afghanistan by car. As it was feared that the Afghan Govern ment might detain him for alleged default over his deal with them neither of his requests were granted. He was, however, permitted to send his machines to Kabul by road. His accounts with the Afghan Government are not yet settled. Captain Murphy is reported to have left India ?/ith the intention of enlisting the help of His Britannic Majesty f B Minister in obtaining a contract for an aerial service between Duzdap and Karachi. The commercial object in view is stated to be the establishment of Cinemas at Meshed which will at receive, by air, films which cannot jU present be transported by ordinary means.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No - £ A &amp; OQ / A 0 ?&lt;P • and address —not to any person by riarjie, but to— J * “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i. i o n “?

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch which X have received from His Majesty's Consul- General at Meshed on the subject of the proposed initiation of an aerial mail service between Jander-Abbas - Kerman Duzdab, and Duzdab - Meshed, together with a copy of a telegram which Colonel Haworth has recently addressed to me on the same subject. 2. It certainly appears to me that the permission oi the Persian Government must in the first case be obtained, &amp;no that the Persian Government are at liberty either to make the proposed line an International Air ^ioute, in which ease anybody could fly over it, or to make a special contract with the Forth heat India grading Company on the lines of that recently concluded with the Junket* Gesellschaft. I consequently consider it to be unlikely that the Persian Government will consent to issue a kind oj. hire license’ 1 to the Company*® aircraft in order to enable them to ply between puzdab and Meshed. In any case, should this privilege be given to the Company, it would seem that a similar authorization, if requested, could hardly be withheld from the Russians - an eventually which would scarcely be welcomed either by His Majesty’s Government, or by the Government of India. 4. My view is therefore briefly that if would be as well not to encourage the Persian Government to throw open this line to/ 5he Right Hohourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K«G., BS.P. Foreign Office. ■PWto aviation until the oonsequencesof doing so have been thoroughly examined by the competent authorities, and then only in favour of a British enterprise which can confidently be relied upontto develop it efficiently and in a manner calculated to do credit to, and be a sound advertisement of, British aviation. It would be highly regrettable, and decidedly damaging to prospects of developing further British aviation enterprises in this country if the first venture of this sort were to be unsatisfactory or discreditable. 5. If His Majesty’s Government were satisfied on these two points - the desirability in principle of opening up aviation on this line and the competency of the applicant Company - I am of opinion that the contract made with the Junkers Company by the Persian Government offers a useful precedent for a working agreement. V 6.

Loraine to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received March 3.) (No. 88.) Tehran, February 11, 1926. ’ I HAVE the honour, with reference to my telegram No. 53 of the 10th February, to forward herewith translation of the press version of the Bill sanctioning a contract with the Junkers Aviation Company for the establishment of air services in Persia which was passed by Parliament on the 9th February. An authentic text of the Bill will not be available before the departure of the mail, but if it should show any important differences I shall inform you of these by telegraph if necessary. 2. There is some doubt about the exact wording and interpretation of article 1, and M. Jarolimek told me in an interview I had with him this morning that he did not himself know how it had been finally phrased. He asserted that the company asked for no more than that they should have a monopoly of subsidy, on the three lines conceded to them and that they had no desire for the monopoly of flight which, according to the text which I have received, they are to enjoy. 3. Regarding the second article, he told me that the only European air line with which the company could hope to connect one of their Persian lines within the three months specified was the Russian service Baku-Rostov-Moscow, operated by an Ukrainian company. To make this connection his company intended to operate a hydroplane service between Baku and Pahlavi without subsidy. The service via Tabriz and Anatolia was too difficult and dangerous for their present resources and aircraft, even three-engined machines, but he hoped before long to connect with an Imperial Airways Service at Kuraitu. 4. I beg leave to call your special attention to clauses (a) and (c) of article 8. The effect of them will, it seems, be to give Germany a very commanding position in Persian aviation, military and commercial, and I shall he glad to be informed in due course how they are viewed by His Majesty’s Government. If they can possibly be interpreted as an infringement of the spirit or letter of the Treaty of Versailles the French may, presumably, be relied upon to protest. With reference to clause {a), M. Jarolimek informed me that the conditions under which their machines and personnel would be placed at the disposal of the War Office would form the subject of a special agreement; in any case, under no circumstances would German personnel be used in operations unless they volunteered. Fie ridiculed the idea of the heavy Junkers commercial machines being taken seriously by any European Power as a factor in operations. 5. The French, I fear, are sore at their defeat and a little displeased at the ( neutral attitude which I have felt obliged to adopt. They are inclined to blame anyone but themselves, and they have only themselves to blame. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE. Enclosure in No. 1.

Loraine to Sir Austen Chamberlain,—(Received January 18, 1926.) (No. 681.) Tehran, December 29, 1925. I HAVE the honour to inform you that M. Jarolimek, the local manager of the Junkers Company, called on me a lew days ago, having recently returned from his visit to Europe. 2 . M. Jarolimek began by saying that the French competition for the Persian air j contract had proved severe ; he was, however, about to have a thorough discussion of the situation with the German Minister in order to see whether the situation could be saved for Junkers. Junkers were unable to abate their financial requirements below the figure to which the Persian negotiators had brought them down in the summer. Here the French company was undercutting them; they had at first asked for 2 krans j per kilogramme, but had now come down to 1’75 krans; in this Junkers was unable to follow them. 3 . M. Jarolimek expressed his satisfaction with several conversations he had had with the British air authorities in London and said that his company looked forward to | co-operation with the southern air line to be operated by Imperial Airways, with which they expected to link up at Bushire and hoped to connect at Bagdad. In this latter connection, he stated that he had been given to understand by Sir Sefton Brancker that the difficulty as regards Junkers flying their machines to Bagdad might disappear in a not distant future in view of the alteration in the status of German aviation which was a likely sequel to the Locarno P;ict, and was already under some discussion, and of the probable adhesion of Germany to the International Air Convention. I rather pricked up my ears at this statement, as Sir Sefton Brancker had sent me an account of his conversation with M. Jarolimek, from which I had gathered that the disinclination of the British authorities to have German machines flying to Bagdad had by no means weakened. That this is indeed the case has become abundantly apparent from your TUT telegram No. 274 of the 24th instant, replying to my telegram No. 408 of the 22nd ^ a idem sent after the conversation recorded in this despatch. 4 . Thereupon M. Jarolimek painted me an attractive picture of the brilliant situation of his company, of its predominance in a sort of international air chamber thanks to the numerous subsidiary companies which they had founded in States other than Germany, of the prospect which Junkers had of being allowed to create air lines in British dominions and in Egypt and of the possibility of their selling a number of their tri-motor machines to Imperial Airways, the only hitch being the present high price, which, however, it would soon be possible to reduce. He especially stated that; His Majesty’s Government were raising no objection to the formation of a company with Egyptian capital under the advice and technical management of Junkers, to starts an air line in Egypt and, if possible, to connect it with a line from Trieste to Alexandria. Having had doubts regarding the accuracy of one of M. Jarolimek’s previous statements, as set forth in paragraph 3, I thought it advisable to check this one also and telegraphed for that purpose to Lord Lloyd. His Lordship replied without delay L that, on the other hand, the project was not viewed with favour by His Majesty’s ; ' Government and that he himself was strongly opposed to it. 5. Another statement was that Junkers had sent, or were sending, a flight of five or six aeroplanes to the Union of South Africa with a view to the establishment of an air line there. I should be glad to learn whether there is any truth in this assertion, and whether in point of fact this German company is likely to be allowed to start enterprises of the kind in British dominions. 6 . The day before this interview I had received from Sir Sefton Brancker translation of an article from “ Die Welt am Abend ” indicating that Junkers were in a state of virtual bankruptcy, their liabilities amounting to some enormous sum. As this information corroborated that which you were so good as to communicate to me in your telegram No. 255 of the 9th instant, and was quotable without any breach of confidence, I decided, having these suspicions of M. Jarolimek’s earlier statements in my mind, to [1181 s—4]challenge mildly the glowing account he had given me of his company s general position. I therefore alluded to this newspaper article and enquired how, it the tacts were as stated therein, Junkers were going to carry through their extensive projects. M Jarolimek told me that the article was a part of a regular campaign conducted against Junkers by the German Aero-Lloyd, and the banks which backed that company, the main motive being jealousy and commercial rivalry. M. Jarqlimek said his company had admitted that as regards the duplication of air services in Germany there was justice in the criticism made against Junkers, who had decided to amalgainate with the Aero-Lloyd in respect of all services within the frontiers of the German Reich. the Junkers offshoots and subsidiaries outside Germany were, however, to remain entirely independent of the Aero-Lloyd and under their own existing management. ihe financial difficulties, according to M. Jarolimek, had been grossly exaggerated, there were difficulties because there were some 4 million marks owing to them from Glide, and another big sum from Turkey, which the company had not yet been able to recover. However, as soon as these allegations had been made the Junkers Company, conhdent in their financial stability, had requested the German Government to send a commission to examine all their books and make a report. This had been done and Junkers had been given a clean financial bill. ,, T r i u 7. I have reported these circumstances at some length because M. Jarolimek, who has always posed as being absolutely frank and above-board, now seems to be a gentleman of not quite unimpeachable veracity, and one who will need caretul Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner for Irak.

His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin presents His compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith translation of a lecture given in Berlin on the 28th of September by Mr* Jaroljmeh, the representative of the Junkers Werke in Teheran, on the political and economic conditions in Persia with special reference to aerial traffic* British Embassy. Berlin. 17th November 1925.V I • •r'\ ' .J Traaaslation. 4 2 4.5 .' it w s , i ,r On the 28th September Mr, Jaroljmek, the representative of the Junkers Werke in Teheran, lectured on the political and economical conditions in Persia and gave special consideration to the aerial trafxic, rhis lecture was arranged by the German-Persian Society, Berlin, and the Oriental Societies connected with it. Mr.Jaroljmek was able to inform his audience of a great number of facts concerning new Persia which, even to those competent and interested had not been previously known. Persia is to-day a military state ruled by a number of energetic and highly , educated politicians and generals with Prime Minister Re 2 a khan as head of the government. The military power which these men have succeeded in obtaining has above all helped to strengthen the government and consequently the whole state also. Whilst Persia was, up to the war, only a pawn in the game of European politics, its consolidation now permits of independent policy in spite of its exposed situation which in many ways resembles that of Germany. Since August of last year, when the American Consul at Teheran was murdered, Persia had been under martial law which enabled the Government to carry out its administra tive measures. A large number of foreigners are employed in the Persian Government service and they have helped much towards making its work successful. Chiefly the American financial controllers, appointed by the Persian Government, have carried out their task in a proper manner and at the same time they have succeeded in keeping the Persian currency 1 stable, which to-day is one of the best in the world, and also to work their policy of taxation in such a manner that they hope to be able, in the near future3 future, to 'balance Persia^ budget and even to attain to a surplus without burdening the tax-payers too heavily. 1 he modern means of conveyance and the modern equipment of the army have helped a great deal towards the achievement of this success, fhe troops possess aeroplanes with German and Russian pilots, a large number of motor cars, - and wireless stations are being erected - all this serves to acquaint the population with these modem improvements. The aeroplanes, in particular, have made it possible for the first time in Persian history, to convey troops etc. as well as their leaders with unheard of rapid- 1 ity to places where the danger was greatest and their presence urgently required. Reza Xhan always travels ac companied by German aeroplanes which were responsible for his success in the suppression of the revolt of the lurs and enabled him to hoist the Persian flag again in the : i south-western oil district, how that the Sheik of Mohamera whose relations with England are well known, together with his family, has been imprisoned in Teheran, which success 1 means not only an important gain of prestige for the Persian Government but at the sane time an extraordinary loss of prestige for England, the above mentioned district may rightly be considered as absolutely pacified. However, this loss of prestige is not considerable enough to prevent England from pursuing with tenacity its own policy in other districts. This year a revolt of the Turkomans was suppress ed in a comparatively short time by the help of the aero planes and it is certain that the government, aided by such modern means, will, in future, be able to settle allall political riots quicKLy. It is true that these revolts greatly delayed the execution of the new leaders 1 plans, Nevertheless, they have heen very successful, particularly in educational and sanitary matters and in the development of traffic. Besides this a great change has taken place in Persia with regard to the towns which are being improved oy many new buildings, electric lighting, and even the build ing of electric tramways is being considered. As far as Persia*s relation to foreign countries is concerned, its geographical situation must always be taken into considera tion. Persia is forced to pay great regard to its neighbours' - the Russians and the British - because of its long fron tiers andthe British interests in the Persian oil district. It stands to reason that the maintenance of normal and friendly relations is often very difficult, and it is wonderful how the Persian politicians have succeeded in avoiding all conflicts. The influence of other nations is of no great importance but the fact must not be overlooked that Prance has an unmistakable influence on Persian civilisation owing to the Prench language being widely used in Persia. The Germans are very much liked and many of them are employed in Government service, in the Ministry of War, in the Aeronautical and many other departments. Only lately a German expert has been engaged by the Ministry of labour and the engagement of a German mining engineer is to follow shortly. The German school has been reopened after having been closed for many years, and a German doctor has returned to the Persian capital. The friendliness towards the Germans has not suffered very much from the fact that late ly many Germans of an adventurous nature have visited Persia and( and have in spite of a very friendly, even almost enthusi- astio, reception, published in the German and foreign press unfriendly criticism. Persia 1 s trade is now not so important as it was oefore the war owing to the fact that the principal route through Hussia cannot be used to the same extent as before the war. All other export routes of Persia, namely Bagdad as well as that of Bushire and Baluchistan point to the Bast whilst naturally Persia's principal buyers are in the West from where it must also cover its demands for goods. As soon as the transit trade via the Caucasus become normal again, Persia can, without doubt, count upon an improvement in its export and import trade. German industry, in partic ular, would in that case find good prospects of doing business in Persia. The chances for the sale of automobiles are especially favourable in Persia as it has no railways, and is not likely to have them for some time to come,while oe the other hand roads are being built and the whole country will consequently, in future, be dependent on a very exten- I sive motor car traffic. German settlers have good prospects in Persia if they are fond of work and possess sufficient means to enable them to work quietly till they can make use of their first harvest. The schemes, however, of damming valleys and erecting long-distance power-stations do not stand much chance of being realised in the near future. German firms doing business in Persia have been successful but not to the extent desired. The reason of this is the shortage of capital in Persia as in all other countries and the economic conditions of the whole world. lievertheless some German firms, such as Junkers and Siemens and Halske, have lately established branches in Persia. Siemens &amp; Halske areare fitting up a modem telephone service in the Persian capital. The first German all-metal aeroplane in Persia, the 'Kuckuclf 1 was sent by the firm of Junkers to Teheran in 1923 in order to study the possibilities of flying in Persia and on its return flight over the Caucasus accomplish ed a remarkable record in German aviation. In connection with this success the Kussians tried to obtain a licence for all the korth Persian aerial lines which they wanted to worn with Junkers aeroplanes. This licence was not granted to them, but the Persian Ministry of War bought several all- metal aeroplanes in 1924 and engaged 5 employees from Junkers, In the meantime some more aeroplanes have been sold to Persia and the aeroplanes bought are going to start shortly from Per- -to Teheran and it is hoped that tnis llight will be accomplished within three days, last spring Junkers worked some trial lines in Persia for a few months - viz. Baku - Enzeli - Teheran twice a week, Teheran-Ispahan once a week. Thus the possibility of regular flights has been proved and immense advantages have been gained especially in the carria§i of mails, valuable goods and passengers. In consequence of this success the firm of Junkers made a very favourable contract with Persia obtaining a government subsidy for three lines to Baku, Bagdad and Bushire. This contract practically places for the future the monopoly of the principal aerial routes in the hands of Junkeis* As the British have not placed any difficulties into the way of Junkers 1 endeavours regarding the aerial traffic, but, on the contrary, have declared their willingness to forward the Persian mail by their lines, it may be supposed that Peisia will possess in a short time a perfect system of aerialaerial routes which will he conijected with the British lines from the Suez Ganal to India. The saving of time in a country like Persia, without roads, is obvious The post from Teheran to Bushire takes at least 4 weeks, a caravan of goods £-3 months, a motor car a fortnight, whilst an aeroplane takes 7 to 8 hours. In consequence of the concession granted to Junkers, this firm intends in the future to work the following routes: Teheran - Tabriz (which line will be connected with the Turkish aerial routes and which is the shortest aerial route to Europe) , Teheran- Me^anderan, Teheran-Meshed, Teheran-Ispadhan-Jezd-kerman further lines from Tabriz to Tiflis and from Meshed to Kussian Turkestan etc.14—1766 F.O.P.

[E 4612/324/34] 280 u : y ^ k No: [August 6, 1925.] Section 5. Sir P. Loraine to Mr. Austen Chamberlain.—(Received August 6.) (No. 392.) Sir, Gulhek, July 16, 1925. WITH reference to my telegram No. 187 of’ the 10th instant, I have the honour to forward translation of’ the Bill regarding the contract of the Junkers Company which has been submitted to Parliament by Government. 2. At my last interview with M. Jarolimek he had given me certain information of the nature of the proposed contract, a brief outline of which was communicated to you in my telegram referred to above, and had again assured me that there was no mention of a monopoly in Persia. 3. The Bill, however, unequivocally gives to the company the exclusive right for five years of aviation on the three routes Tehran-Enzeli, Tehran-Bushire and Tehran- Kuraitu. I am unable to believe that M. Jarolimek intended to mislead me on a matter which was so soon to become public, but I have at present no explanation of the apparent inconsistency. 4. I understand from the second paragraph of your telegram No. 101 of the 3rd June that it is held that in granting a monopoly to a company subsidised by them selves the Persian Government are not infringing the International Air Convention, but I have thought it advisable to report the matter by telegram in case it may appear proper to His Majesty’s Government that action should be taken. 5. It may here be remarked that my information is that any concession involving the grant of a monopoly to foreigners will certainly meet with strong opposition in Parliament. 6. The other clauses of the Bill do not substantially differ from the information given me by M. Jarolimek. In the Bill, the subvention, guaranteed for eighteen months, is assessed at 3 krans per kilometre flown on the weekly postal service ; by M. Jarolimek it was stated to be 60,000 tomans a year. A rough estimate of the mileage that would be flown in a year valued at 3 krans per kilometre gives a sum approximately equivalent to M. Jarolimek’s figure. 7. As regards clause 7, M. Jarolimek informed me that it had been decided that intermediate landings to pick up posts should be made at Kazvin on the flight Tehran- Enzeli ; at Hamadan and Kermanshah on the flight Tehran-Kuraitu, and at Kashan, Isfahan and Shiraz on the flight Tehran—Bushire. 8. The clause referring to the right of the Persian Government to demand aircraft and personnel from the company in the case of war or local disturbance, which appeared in the draft contract, copy of which was forwarded to you with my despatch No. 332 of the 19th June, is to be omitted. Such an arrangement would form the subject of a special contract. In any case the company will not agree to the employ ment of its aircraft or personnel against a European Power. 9. M. Jarolimek estimates that the minimum number of aircraft necessary to maintain the postal services will be seven, of which two will be in reserve. 10. A recent examination of the articles of the Convention for the Regulation of Aerial Navigation has brought to light an apparent difficulty in reconciling the grant of this concession by the Persian Government to a German firm with the provisions of article 5 of the convention. As far as I am aware, the Persian Government have not been granted the special derogation referred to in the additional protocol of the 13th October, 1919, which seems to be necessary in this case. 11. I do not feel certain of the precise construction which should be placed on these stipulations, and I should therefore be grateful for information whether His Majesty’s Government attach importance to this point. It seems that any protest should properly come from the French Government. 12. I am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department and to His Majesty’s Higb Commissioner for Irak, Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE. [1041 f—5]2 Enclosure in No. 1. Bill submitted to Parliament by Government in connection with the Junkers Aviation Company, July 5, 1925. (Translation.) WHEREAS the establishment of aerial postal services in Persia would immensely facilitate communications and traffic with other countries and in the interior of Persia and would surely lead to the increase and prosperity of trade, and having regard to the fact that such rapid means of communication can be utilised on many occasions by various Departments for the discharge of their urgent work, the following clauses are being submitted to Parliament for early consideration and sanction :— Clause 1. As the German company, Junkers, represented by M. Edmond Jarolimek, an Austrian subject, undertakes to perform one weekly flight by aeroplane from Tehran to each of the towns Pahlavi (Enzeli), Bushire and Kuraitu and one weekly flight from those towns to Tehran, the monopoly of aviation on the above-mentioned routes is hereby granted to that company for a period of five years, beginning from the date of enactment of this law. Clause 2. From the date of establishment of the aerial service for a period of eighteen months the Imperial Government will pay to Junkers a subsidy of 3 krans for each kilometre flown in accordance with the terms of clause 1. Clause 3. At the end of the eighteen months mentioned in clause 2 of this Bill the Imperial Government will have the right to stop payment of the allowance mentioned in the same clause. Clause 4. The Junkers Company agrees to convey a weekly postal despatch, with a weight of not less than 75 kilog., to and from each of the towns mentioned in clause 1. Clause 5. During the period of the concession, which is five years, the whole revenue accruing from the surtax collected by the Government from the aerial posts will be paid to the Junkers Company after deduction therefrom of the expenditures of the Department ; but when this revenue exceeds the sum of 4,000 tomans the surplus will not be paid to the company. When the revenue in question is less than 4,000 tomans the company may not demand the balance. In view of the Treasury law concerning the centralisation of revenues, a credit of 32,000 tomans is hereby sanctioned to be paid to the company out of the revenues accruing from the surtax of the air mail. Clause 6. Parliament hereby decrees that out of the savings of the credits already passed and sanctioned for the year 1304 a credit of 72,000 tomans should remain at the disposal of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs in order that it may pay to the Junkers Company the amounts mentioned in clauses 2 and 5. No payments are allowed to be made out of the above-mentioned credits before the amounts in question are duly secured therefrom. Clause 7. The aeroplanes will land in such towns situated on the lines of flight as the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs may designate. Clause 8. The charges and the conditions of passenger and freight traffic will be fixed with the approval of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Clause 9. The rate of the surtax for the air mail will be decided by the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Clause 10. The Ministries of War, of Posts and Telegraphs, of the Interior, and for Foreign Affairs are charged with the drafting and ratification ot the contract for aerial service with the Junkers Company.

It is impossible to comunie&amp;te definite or final proposals, but scheme ®t present under con sideration, and ahleh is not likely to be modified substantially, would include weekly service in each direction between Basra and Karachi, operated by small machines carrying probably no passengers but only freight and mails. Tena of agreement would be five years. Landing places in Persian territory would be Bush ire, some point between there and Bandar Abbas, Bandar Abb&amp;s itself. Jack and Charbar. Building operations of any magnitude would probably not be required on these aerodromes, but possible some extension of their limits and preparation of the surface may be advisable. Operating company may desire to erect quarters on small scale for personnel and Air Ministry may find it desirable to establish small wireless stationsstations to be operated by company’s personnel, Landing places at Bush ire t Jask and Charbar are believed to be supervised and maintained at present by British agency* These observations are made on assumption that these aerodromes may be regarded for practical purposes as in British occupation. If, however, Persian Government take definite view that as civil operation is being started these aerodromes must be Persian aerodromes equipped and maintained at Persian expense, this attitude would have to be accepted* ifo subsidy is asked for from Persian Government regarding this service. Persia having adhered to International Air Convention, His Majesty’s Government are entitled to assume that no difficulties will be placed in way of British service on an international route. In first instance I shall be glad to receive as soon as possible by telegram your advice as to beat method and form in which to approach Persian Government and I wish to emphasise desirability that any communication to them, should you think one advisable, shotild only be in purely general terms.

V/hile British interests in civil air services in Persia are for the moment concerned with the southern route from basra ^ through Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Jask to Charbar, it may also be desired eventually to develop branch services into the interior of Persia, and the Council would prefer not to tie their hands by a formal allocation of routes.

The Council are not clear what is meant by the sta* e lent that ’’the Junker Company feel confident of obtaining the monopoly of an air service to Persia'; if it merely means that they will be the only company subsidised by the Persian Government, or that a nominally Persian Junker subsidiary will be given the monopoly inside Persia, this would be within the rights of Persia under the International Air Convention; and (provided of course that the stage Bush ire-Bandar Abbas was regarded as part of an international route) the Council The Under secretary of State, Foreign Office, S • Vk 4 1.

'•; I I have th« honour to inform you that in tht eouraft of &amp; recant interriew I asked the German Minister to tell m« mhat was tha situation m regards the negotiations between tha Junkars Company and tha Persian Government. Count Schulanhurg said that Junkers 1 first proposals had not been acceptable and h@ hi^iself considered that their demands in the way of money rera excessive. How, however, they had coma down to a mor# reasonable basis; tha Persian Government had laid down the air services which they wished to see established in the following order of importance:- (!) Baku • Tehran - Isfahan. (2) Tehran - Khanikin. (3) Tehran - Isfahan - feShiras - Bushire. The negotiations were now concentrated on route fo. 1 and the usual difficulties were being encountered; the Persians wanted to have sverything on a very grand scale, but were not prepared to put down the money for it. He was by no means sure that the scheme would go through, but he was convinced that routes Numbered 2 and 3 were pure *&amp;ukunfts rauslk*. Count Sehulenburg was unable to tell ms whether Juakers fit* night Honourabl* Austaa Chaabarlain&gt; * FOH^IGK OFFIOls1 Junkers had my connection* in London or were in contact with the Director of Civil Aviation, though he thought it likely* I expressed the view that if there was no contact, it ought to be established; this might avoid an undesirable clash of interests, and I thought it both fair and friendly to tell Count Schulenburg that, although no definite proposals had yet been made for the establishment of a British air service over Persian territory, it was quit« probable that such proposals would be put forward in the near future. The matter would be one of importance for us as the direct route t© India so obviously lay across Persia: 1 did not suppose that we should wish to interfere in any way or compete with German air services in northern Persia, but 1 foresaw a distinct possibility of objection if enterprises other than British sought to establish themselves on air routes impinging on that to India. A scramble for position would be undesirable and had best be avoided; on the other hand, an understanding and even an arrangement for connections as between two systems might be possible and even advantageous. I explained that these were ray personal views but I thought they would very likely be shared in London. Count schulenburg said he was veiy glad I had given him this useful indication, which he would bear in mind; he quite understood the point of view about the air rout# to India and found it a perfectly natural one; moreover, he thought it most unlikely that Junkers would wish to clash in any wiy with our Interests.I as sending eopie* of this despatch to the Government of India and to His tajesty’a High -* &gt; — ^ ' ■■■ '*' ■ Cemis^ionar at Bagiidad# I have, etc* (Bde) Percy Loraiae*COPY.

(1) The Junker© Company are most desirous to do nothing in this country which we might regard a© detrimental to British interests, or to collide in any way with those interests. L„J&amp;rolimek made it quite clear to me that it would suffice for me to .wake our wishes known in any regard for them to secure immediate respect, and he assured (k' p *) • ib ***» Ajf * * ' ' me categorically that there was no question whatever of - jj , _ , . , hi® Company seeking a monopoly of civil aviation in Persia. ( } The Junkers Company, which is a purely German one, would be only too glad to work in h&amp;roiony with any British Company desirous of establishing air routes over Persian The Might Honourable Austen Chamberlain, k.k., Foreign Officeiersian territory ♦ Thoy had excellent relatione with Imperial Airways, Limited, and had been in oommunicatloa with Sir Lief ton Brmmekmr* According to M.Jmr&amp;lirnm dir d Franck or had let it bo understood tiiat some planner work in ctvifttion in Persia by the Junkers Company was by no means unwelcome to British interests* (3) The Junkers Company were thoroughly disgusted with their dealings with howlot Hussia. They had already closed down the factory they had started in Hubs la,finding that the treatment of the Soviet dorsrnmont and conditions generally in Eussia of to-day rendered the conduct of satisfactory business quits impossible. The policy of the Company now was to avoid any route which passed over Russian territory. If they succeoclod in establishing a route via Brail* and trebi»ond, and Tabris, they would probably abandon the Baku run. (4) Thair experience of flying conditions in Psrsia was on the whole quite favourable. The most difficult and dangerous flight was between Tshraa and ^naeli; the climatic and atmospheric conditions on either elds of the Hlburz range being totally different. (5) They are convinced that the only aeroplane of mny use in this climate and altitude, and having regard also to the very primitive resources available for repairs, etcaetera, is an all-steel machine. They consider that a wood aad fabric machine will never stand the wear and tear of conditions in rersia nor the violent alternations of temperature* (6) M*Jarelimek told me in personal confidence that the Persian Government are contemplating placing a large orderdrder for aeroplanes, probably twonty maeliin^s* of Hie Junker type* these will hm for the use of the Persian artiiy, but will be unarmed, non-iailitary mao nines.

At the time they are not yet in a position to put forward a concrete eeheme, and it is not deed red that over- optimistic representations ciiould be made to the iersian Government with a political object, since a disappointment might obviously react unfavourably on future British air enterprise in Persia. f fhe Air Council would accordingly suggest that the Persian Govensaent should be informed that the Aerodromes at Buehire, /Sunder Abbas, Cash and Charbar are regarded by a.M. Covermaent as forming a route which they hope may be kept peaniaaently open for flying. In ©ardor to provide for a regular service, some flight iiaprov^ents would h® required, which would it ia thought involve little expenditure. A ourvey of intermediate emergency landing grounds would, however, be requisite. In order to advise on these matters and on the organisation of the route generally, H.M.

Mr. Austen Chamberlain will be aware that Persia as a ht&amp;te contracting to the International Air Convention has the right under Article 16 to establish reservations end restrictions in favour of her national aircraft (i.e., aircrai w entered on the Persian register as belonging wholly to Persian nationals or to a Persian Company, the President, or the Chairman, and at least two thirds of the Directors of which are of Persian nationality) in ccnuection with the csrrlage of persons and goods for hire between two points on her territory; but this right does not extend to the granting of a monopoly in favour of the aircraft of another contracting State, still less of a State which is not a party to the Convention.

It is understood that Monsieur Jarolimek believes that the American financial Adviser is the chief obstacle to his schemes, and this appears probable if the re port is true that he ii askiiv for a subsidy of Ts. 3,000 a month for-a bi weekly service between Tehran and .^aku and 4,000 Tomans a month for a similar service between Tehran and Isfahan. The extension of the service to Bushire and eventually to other towns in Persia is talked of by . onsieur Jarolimek, who has already published an anonymous leaflet con ratulating the Persian nation on having inaugurated an air service which puts them on the level of the most civilised nations of the world in respect of ease and rapidity of travel* It may hat here be mentioned that konaieur Jarollmek acta in an increasing degree as dviser to t e ar Office on matters affecting their own Air Force and that he has made proposals for the establishment of a Be bool of Aviation under his own direction for the training of military pilots, if 1 the French pilot, Lonsieur Berhault, to whom the direction of this school had been promised, has been killed, as unf 0 rtunately seems probable ..ince he has beea-mlijainp since heIjie 1ms l&gt;een missing ainoe hs left Bandar ^ilam h$ air for •Isfahan on the Xtth Boo ember, l onaieur Juroli lek’s ohanoes of realiairig this project mm to have improved, I urn not aifare whether there is an^r participation of British capital in the Junkers 1 Joraand will be grateful for information on this point.

REPORTS which have reached Enzeli show thatserious unemployment exists around Baku particularly in the oil and shipbuilding trades. The leport paragraph 1 of summary^ No. 23 regarding disturbed and insecure conditions m that area has been corroborated from an independent source. Nearly 2,000 Persian workmen have returned to Persia from the oil-fields dur g the ^ 2 St Information has been received at Enzeli that Persian merchants who have sent goods to the Baku Fair will be allowed to take back cash m the following proportion of the value :— 30 per cent, of cotton. 20 per cent, of gum-tragacanth. 15 per cent, of rice and dried fruits. The balance of the value is presumably to be taken in goods, but a fairly reliable report says that, in some cases, goods will not be available for six months. Azerbaijan. 3. It is reported that Zakki Bey, secretary of the Turkish Legation, whose departure for Tabriz was reported in last week’s s|mmary, was sent with the mission of ascertaining the feeling m Persian Azeibai]an towards lurks and Russians. There is much talk in Tabriz of strained relations between Russians and 4. Sami Bey has started propaganda against the Christians of the Urumia district, particularly against returned refugees, on the ground that these will eventually form a dangerous force susceptible to British mtiuence. 5. The Turks have sent Dr. A. Paparyan, a refugee anti-Bolshevik Armenian, who has been for the last two years in Tabriz, to Urumia as a secret agent. Tehran 6. The political situation has not materially altered during the week Reza Khan has continued his efforts to secure the acquiescence of parliamentary leaders to the passage of the Sinclair Oil Concession, which is due to be presented to the Mai lis'during the coming week. That now appears to be his mam preoccupation. There has been in parliamentary circles some reluctance to come to terms owing to apprehensions felt as to the action intended by Reza Khan against the Majlis alter it has served his purpose by ratifying the oil concession. . . . . . 7. The agitation in favour of the Shah’s return has been maintained during the week, and open pro-republican propaganda is rarely heaid. A reconciliation [705 f—1]W il 2 lias been effected between Reza Khan and the Heir Apparent, who now profess* complete faith in each other. It seems unlikely that Reza Khan will openly oppose the Shah’s return, should His Majesty have the courage to reoccupy his throne. 8- A Bill has been presented to the Majlis by Kai Astawan, Member for Enzeli, proposing the denunciation of the existing treaties with Germany, Austria and Spain, and the framing of new treaties which would omit the Capitulations. 9. Anonymous leaflets were distributed in the Majlis some time ago accusing the Prime Minister of appropriating to his own use 5 of the 18 crores allotted annually to the army. An officer of the Military Finance Department, who was generally believed to have been partly responsible for the production of the leaflets, disappeared shortly afterwards. It has now been discovered that he was secretly done to death. 10. It is reported, and it is corroborated by his own actions in Tehran, that Shahrestani, a Nejef mullah of some standing, who arrived in Tehran some weeks ago, en route to Meshed on pilgrimage, has been entrusted by the ulama of Nejef with the task of uniting all the ulama of Persia in support of the monarchy. 11. The Parliamentary Budget Commission has refused to approve the salaries of Ministers and Ambassadors who have been in one post for more than four years, the period sanctioned by a law passed by the fourth Majlis. 12. The following report has been received from an individual in touch with the Russian Legation whose reliability is unknown :— 1 The Afghan and Turkish Ministers and the Musawwat Committee have decided to co-operate in anti-Bolshevik intrigues. They have formed four committees—In Enzeli, Meshed, Tabriz and Tehran. Their main effort is to be directed against the Russians in the Caucasus, where they consider they have most chances of success.” y 13. Jarolimek, a representative of the Junker Company, recently arrived m Tehran. Among the questions he is discussing with the Persian Government is that of the proposed Moscow-Tehran passenger and postal air service. 14. A report has been received from the French Legation that ten more Junker aeroplanes are being supplied to the Persian Government. A similar report has been received from a quite independent source at Enzeli. 15. Three of the aeroplanes which were reported to have arrived at Enzeli (summary No. 20, paragraph 10), have reached Tehran by motor lorry. Two of these are said to be small dual-control machines for instructional purposes. 16. Shumyatski returned to Tehran on the 24th June from Baku. 17. It has been decided by the Council of Ministers to dismiss all “ White ” Russians now in the service of the Public Works Department and to replace them by Germans. The Russian Legation has for some time been pressing the Persian Government to dismiss anti-Bolshevik Russians. 18. Wassmuss has sent to Mitchell, the adviser to the Public Works Department, a proposed contract for the construction of a motor road from Bushire to Shiraz. He is on the point of leaving on a short visit to Berlin. 19. The report mentioned in paragraph 18 of summary No. 23 that a certain number of German families were coming to Persia as agriculturists has been corroborated. They were recently reported in the press to have reached Belgrade 20. Four Rolls-Royce armoured cars have arrived in Tehran from Bushire Thp English mechanics who were understood to be coming with them apparently did not leave England, and the cars are in charge of Russian mechanics. 21. Twelve Benz 3-ton lorries arrived in Tehran on the 26th from Bushire Luristan. 22. The hopes of the Government that the moral effect of the use of aeroplanes would be the early submission of the Lurs have not been justified With the exception of a minor skirmish it is believed that there has been no further fi^htinp* but the Lurs are showing an understandable reluctance to come in or to believe in the genuineness of the amnesty offered by the Government. 23. It is authentically reported that a number of the infantry officers sent from lehran to Luristan as reinforcements were very reluctant to join the fighting troons and that many succeeded in evading the front line on various pretexts The General Officer Commanding has reported the matter officially to the Minister for War.r - 3 'Isfahan. 24. During the early part of June the greater part of the Yezd and Ardestan garrisons were moved to Isfahan and concentrated with the Isfahan garrison some little way outside the town. The total accession of strength was about 450 men. In addition, 100 sappers from Shiraz arrived on the 12th June, and 400 men from Behbehan and 350 from Abadeh were expected to arrive on the 15th June. It is probable that this concentration was ordered primarily with a view to reinforcing the Luristan front if that should be necessary. It is not unlikely that it may now be used to coerce the Amir Mujahid, Bakhtiari, who has been for some time in a truculent mood. Fars. 25. Reliable information says that Lakhtianov, Russian consul, Bushire, who arrived at Bushire from Tehran via Bagdad on the 23rd June, will shortly proceed on tour to Bunder Abbas and Kerman. 26. Lidin, who was Russian consul at Bushire, arrived in Shiraz on the 21st June. W. A. K. FRASER, Major, LA., Military Attache.

The file covers negotiations surrounding the grant of a five year concession to Junkers in 1927 for the provision of internal air services within Persia, and the failed negotiations surrounding an attempt by the Company to renew the agreement in 1932. It therefore also contains correspondence about the subsequent withdrawal of Junkers from Persia, and subsequent attempts by Luft Hansa to replace Junkers. Correspondence in the file also discusses a proposal from Imperial Airways to establish a Trans-Persian route between the United Kingdom (UK) and India; this is mainly related to whether the experience of Junkers should be allowed to discourage this proposal.To a lesser extent the file also covers the establishment of air mail and passenger services between Tehran and Baghdad; this ranges from a initial proposal from Airworks Limited in 1932 to the eventual establishment of a service by Iranian State Airways in 1938. Also briefly discussed is a proposal — briefly advanced by the North West Indian Trading Company — from Captain Louis Murphy in 1926 for the establishment of an air service between Duzdap [Zahedan] and Meshed [Mashhad]: see folios 155-9.The French content includes a draft contract between the Government of Persia and Junkers dated June 1925 (see folios 205-16), a copy of the final contract (see folios 139v-143) dated 9 February 1926, and a copy of a notice on changes to Junkers' Persian air services dated 17 October 1931. Occasional extracts can also be found in French.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Tehran, officials of the Air Ministry, and officials of the Foreign Office. The correspondence is periodically forwarded to the Under-Secretary of State for India by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Junkers</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Iranian State Airlines</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Air mail</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airways</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001eb#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
