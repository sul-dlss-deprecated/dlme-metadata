Proposed memorial to Captain S.B Haines, Royal Indian Navy. I am directed by the Governor in Council to refer to Mr. Caroe's letter No. F. 410-N/36, dated the 2nd July 1936, in which the Government of India have asked for information on the following points (a) The part actually taken by Captain Haines in the capture of Aden, &lt;b) the character of his administration over a period of fifteen years, and (c) the nature of the charges preferred against him in 1854 and the result of his trial. 2. As regards (a), the part actually taken by Captain Haines in the capture of Aden has been fully described in the Gazette Extraordinary dated the 20th February 1839 and the Supplement of the Bombay Government Gazette dated the 28th February 1839. Copiee of the two Gazettes are enclosed. 3. As regards (b), there are on the records of this Government numerous reports received from time to time from Captain Haines between the years 1839 and 1854 regarding the measures adopted by him for establishing British Supremacy in and around Aden. Copies of these reports were comnunicated to the Government of India. (vide letter No. 175, dated the 23rd December 1853). The various volumes which have been examined show that the measures adopted by Captain Haines in carrying on the administration of Aden and in his negotiations with the surrounding Arab Chiefs always met with the approbation of both the Government of Bombay and the Government of India. 4.

(4) Letter to Captain Haines No. 943. dated the 28th February 1854. 5. After going through the records relating to Captain Haines* case, the Governor in Council has come to the same conclusion as that contained in Sir Ernest Hotson's letter No. 0/2494, dated the 20th April 1923, viz., that 'altogether, the history of Captain Haines is a matter for pity rather than for pride, and it is better that it should not be cornnemo rated • *THE BOMBAY GOVERNMENT GAZETTE. Extraordinary* Wednesday 20th February 1839. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. Bombay Castle, 19thj(February 1839. / The following copies of dispatches received from Conmander Haines, of the Indian Navy, on a Political Mission to Aden; from His Excellency Rear Admiral Sir Frederick Maitland, K.C.B.; and Mi Major Bailie, Commanding the Military Force sent to Aden, report ing the capture of that place on the 19th ultimo, are published for general information. By order of the Hobble the Governor in Council, Sd. J.P. WILLOUGHBY, Secretary to Government. To, J.P. Willoughby Esquire, Secretary to Government. Sir, I have the honour to inform you, for the information of Government, that during the many Skirmishes which have taken place between the Boats of the Hobble Company^ Sloop of War 'Coote' and the Shore; the Crew of that vessel assited by Lieutenant Evans of the BombayyRegiment, Lieutenant Western of the Bombay Engineers, and the Detachment of the former Officer's Regiment, have behaved with great gallantry, in every instance, and it is wonderful that only two Men of the 'Coote' were wounded. In the last Skirmish of the 11th of January, under the command of Lieutenant Johnstone, they were assisted by the 'Mahi' Schooner, and the Mortar Boat 'Choki'. The action lasted for three or four hours, doing the Energy considerable damage by destroying about twelve feet of their Battery without injury to f themselves. 1 15th January 1839. I have, etc., Sd. S.B. Haines,To J.P. Willou^iby Esquire, Secretary to Government. Sir, I have the honour to inform you, for the information of the Hon’ble the Governor in Council, that the Force for the occupation of Men arrived on the 16th January when I imnediately dispatched a letter into the Town, aadressed to all the Chieftains. The answer was frivolous and unsatisfactory, and with it I received a message saying, they only wanted time to obtain Bedowins, and they were preparing the great Guns for service. In consequence of the above information, I considered it advisable to lose no time in capturing it, more particularly as we had but few days water for the Troops, and I therefore wrote to Captain Smith and to Major Bailie to that effect. Captain Smith accepted my services in taking his Ship in, and I feel proud to say, that he was pleased with the position I gave her. I could not but admire the splendid fire from the shipping and Mortar vessel, and the behaviour of the little Mahi drew the admiration of every person. Nothing could have been more regular than the landings the Men were steady to a degree, and they stormed the place gallantly. But what is still more to be admired, and a greater proof of their discipline is, that after landing, neither male, female, or property was molested. The loss on the side of the British, as will be seen by Major Bailie's letter, which I have the honour to forward, was very trivial until the unfortunate insurrection of the Prisoners from Seerah. The whole loss in killed and wounded including Navy and Army, is 'fifteen' eight of which occurred after the place w^s in our possession. The loss of the Enemy has been very severe: One hundred and thirty nine are now said to be missing, besides i many wounded inland, and we have twenty five Men too severely wounded to return inland, among them one Chieftain Sheik Raggeeb Hazzabee,/—Hazzabee # and Ali Salaam, a Nephew of the Sultan. I have supplied the unfortunate sufferers with food ani every thing, to make them as comfortable as circumstances will admit of, and they receive kind Medical attention from Doctor Malcolmson of the 24th Regiment; I have also given a few Dollars for the support of their families. It would appear like presumption, in me to point out peculiar instances of merit. I therefore leave it to the Senior Naval and Military Officers to do it, and merely state, that it is my firm conviction that British Soldiers and Sailors could not have behaved better. I have, etc., Sd. S.B. Haines, Men, 25th January 1839. To The Hon'ble James Parish Esq., Governor in Council ko., Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith, aopy of a dispatch which I yesterday received from Captain Smith, of Her Majesty^ ship /olage, dated the 22 nd of last month, by which your Honor in Council will be informed of the arrival of the Expedition under his charge to Men on the 16th, and of his having under the cir cumstances, and with the Force mentioned in his letter, success fully attacked and captured that place on the 19th of January. The accompanying Plan of Men being an original paper, and required for transmission to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, I have to request, that I may be favoured by its being returned to me for that purpose. I have, etc., Sd. F.L. Maitland, Rear Admiral and Commander in Chief. Wellesley, at Bombay, 16th February 1839.To His Excellency Rear Admiral Sir F.L. Maitland, Conauander in Chief, &amp;c., East Indies. Sir, I have the honour to inform your Excellency, that the Expedition under my command against this place anchored in the afternoon of the 16th instant:- The same evening I received a letter from the Political Agent, informing me, that all negotiation on his part had failed, and that Hostilities had already coninenced. On receipt of this Letter I corraiunicated with Major Bailie, the Officer Commanding the Troops, and we determined, to lose no time in attacking the place. The 17th was spent in drawing up the Plan of attack, and in making the necessary preparations. On the morning of the 18th I weighed with the Squadron. Her Majesty’s .... Ship .... Volage. Ditto Cruizer. Hon’ble Company's Ship ...'Coote'. Ditto 'liahi'. Transport 'Lowjee Family' Ditto (C Ernaad' Ditto 'Ann Crichton' to proceed to the front of the Town, which I reached in the afternoon, in company with the Cruizer (towing a Mortar Boat) 'Mahi' Schooner. On standing in towards the Island of Seerah, a fire was opened on the Ship with Musketry and several large Gur»$ when I commenced a partial attack. The 'Coote' (Corvette) and Transports, not having come up, I hauled off and anchored for the night. On the morning of the 19th the whole Force having arrived, I made the signal to prepare to attack, and the Troops to be held in readiness for landing in two divisions: At half past nine the ’’Volage* anchored, with a spring on her small Bower Cable, in four fathom water, at about three hundred yards distance from the Tower Battery on the Island of Seerah, at the same/—same time the Mahi took up her position to the Southward of the Island* On standing in, the Enemy opened a fire of great (runs and Musketry on us 9 but the Ship being laid so close to the fehero, the Gruns on the heights were rendered useless, their shot passing over us: at ten the 'Cruizer 1 * anchored and was of essential service in destroying the flank of the Battery. During this period a heavy firing was kejfcup, but in a short time two of the Guns, in the lower Battery were dismounted, and most of the people were driven from the remainder; they however took shelter behind the ruins of the Battery and kept up an incessant fire ^ Musketry on the Ships, and although the lower Batter was almost knocked to pieces, still we had great difficulty in dislodging the Men. At this period, I directed the fire to be opened on the round Tower and Batteries on the heights, which were filled with Men armed with Matchlocks* and in the course of one hour, I had the satis faction to see this Tower (thouga sixty feet high and strongly built) a mass of Ruins; at eleven the 'Coote' anchored with the second Division ox the Troops to the Southward of the Island, and opened her^fire upon the Town. Finding the firing had not ceased from the lower Battery, I directed the Mahi Schooner to proceed to the end of it and endeavour to drive out the Men from behind it by Musketry; This service was performed by her Conmander Lieutenant Daniels, in a most gallant manner, but I regret to say, that Mr* Nesbitt, Midshipman, was severely wounded* The firing having now almost totally ceased, I gave directiom for the Boats of both divisions to land* Lieutenant Dobree, who had charge of the first Division, Mr* Bundle, Mate, and a Quarter Master of this Ship were the first on shore, and made for a sixty eight Pounder which had been fired at us several times, when a Matchlock was fired at the Quarter Master by a Man behind the Gun, who was immediately cut down by him, and the first British Flag was planted by Mr. Bundle. So completely were the Enemy driven from all points (with the exception of the Island) by the fire of the Ships, that the whole/—whole of the Troops landed with the loss of only two Men killed and throe wounded. A partial firing was still kept up from the Island, when I directed Lieutenant Dobree, (who had returned with two Mates) Messrs. Stewart and Bundle, with a Party of Seamen, and Lieutenant Ayles, with the ffiarines, (amounting altogether to fifty) to land and take possession of it, this was gallantly accomplished, the party ascending the heights, spiking, and dismounting the Guns, taking the Flag which had been flying from the Towar^r and making Prisoners of one hundred and thirty nine armed Arabs, who were conducted from the Island to the main by the Party, and given over into the charge of Major Osborne. In an attempt to disarm the Prisoners (made by the Military) they made a most formidable resistance, and I regret to say, that several lives were lost on both sides. Mr* Nesbitt, a Midshipman of the 'Mahi' was the only person hi^bn board the Squag^on, and on the part of the Military Sixteen were killed and wounded, most of them dangerously, and one Serjeant has since died. The enemy’s Guns were served badly and fired irregularly, they appearing to have most confidence in their Matchlocks, and there can be no doubt, that if it had not been lor the total destruction of their defences by the Squadron, the Troops would not have been able to have accomplished their landing without a very serious loss. I have not been able to ascertain the number of armed Men that defended the Town, but from what I can learn, there must have been upwards of one thousand, nor can I come at the exact number that were killed or wounded; twenty five dead bodies were found on the island of Seerah alone, several in the Town, and at this moment there are twenty five wounded lying in the Mosque, amongst whom is the Sultan’s Nephew who defended the island. I beg jto recommend to your notice the gallant services of Lieuten ant Dobree, and Messrs. Stewart and Bundle (Mates) nor can I omit mentioning the assistance I received from Captain Haines, the/-the Political Agent, who from his local knowledge piloted the Ship in which enabled me to take up so effective a position. I hrewith transmit to your Excellency a P^?n of the attack and a list of the Ordnance Stores captured. Lieutenant Dobree is now employed with a party of Men, in endeavouring to get off the three large brass Turkish Guns, which it is the wish of the captors, should be presented to Her Most Gracious Majesty.

Sir, I have the pleasure to state, for the information of the Hon'ble the Governor in Council of Bombay, that the combined Force under Captain Smith, R.N. and myself, have succeeded in capturing the fortified Island, Town, and Pass of Aden, with, I am happy to say, a comparatively small loss of life. 2nd. This unfortunate result would have been still more satisfactory, had it not been for an affray, which took place in attempting to disarm one hundred and thirty nine Arab Prisoners, sent by Lieutenant Dobree, of Her Majesty^ Frigate Volage, who effected their escape, after having killed three, and wounded five Men, with their Creases, with a loss on their part of five killed and seven mortally wounded, having only succeeded, in previously depriving them of their Matchlocks. 3rd. The Town is now in such a state of quiet, the Inhabitants returning daily to their Houses, that I think you may take up your abode in the Town, or any other place you may choose to fix on. 4th. The Officer on Picquet, at the Pass on the Northern side, leading to the interior, has orders to permit all unarmed people to pass out, but I have given orders that no one shall be admitted except people with supplies, without an express order from myself. 5th. I shall be most happy to afford you every assis tance in my power, connected with my Military duties here. ^ 6 th. The Pierzadeh at the Tomb of the Patron Saint of the Mahomedans of Aden, had taken charge of the inhabitants, Male and Female, and on my advance, immediately sent a flag of Truce, which was respected, and their privacy not intruded on in any way. He has sent me a few Matchlocks, but no Creases, and has pledged himself, that there are no more Arms, left amongst the few Arabs, belonging to Aden, at present in the Town. 7th. I have not met with any of the Chiefs mentioned by A ; i, .. - , © you in your letter of the 17th instant, should you obtain any intelligence, of the proceedings in the interior, I shall feel much obliged for any communication; and any assistance you can afford the Commissariat, in provisioning the Troops, will be of the greatest Public Service, as it will enable the Officer in charge, to husband his Bombay Stock. I have, etc., Sd. T. Bailie, Maior. Commanding at Aden. Aden, 22nd January 1839. To J.P. Willourfiby, Esquire, Secretary to Government. Sir, I have the honor to inform you, for the information of the Hon’ble the Governor in Council, that my first endeavours after obtaining possession of Aden, was to encourage the Inhabitants, in their usual occupations, and giving them confidence; in this I have been quite successful, I also immediately wrote to Sultan M. Houssain, and Earned, and to the Chieftains of the Hazzabee Sullanec subdivisions H.Agrabee and Honshabee Tribes and others, offering t&lt; give their wounded, medical assistance, and to permit them to have free and friendly intercourse with the Town. 2nd. This had the desired effect, and the Chieftains all expressed a wish to be on terms of Peace and Friendship, and to shew they were sincere, sent in supplies and Camels to assist in landing Government Stores. 3rd. I also wrote letters to the different Ports on the Coast, informing the Governors, that Men was free for trade, being now a British Port. I have, etc., Sd. S.B. Haines. J.P. WILLOUGHBY, Secy, to Government. Aden, 28 th January 1838. General/—SgngJfll Order by the Hon'ble the GoTerno r in Council . Bombay Castle, 19th February 1839. The Hon'ble the Governor in Council experiences the hipest gratification in offering to Captain Smith, Her Majesty's Ship Volage, Conmanding the Naval part of the Expedition; to Commander Haines, of the Indian Navy, the Political Agent, who volunteered his Services in that Frigate, and to the several Commanders and Officers of the Vessels engaged on this duty the cordial thanks of Government for their gallant, zealous and effective services. The spirited conduct of Lieutenant Danielle and the Hon'ble Company's Shcooner Mahi is deserving of special notice. To Major Bailie and to the Military part of the Expedition under his comnand, the Hon'ble the Governor in Council feels it his duty to express his warm acknowledgnents for the steady and soldierlike behaviour observed by all ranks, European and Native, during the attack, and after the capture. The higb discipline of the Troops was displayed in an exemplary manner by their cheerfully enduring the great privation of food to which they were unavoidably exposed, and particularly, in their abstaining from all violence to the inhabitants, and respecting the families of the Natives, conduct which reflects honor on themselves and on their country.

The following report of the capture of Aden from Major Bailie, not having reached Government with the other despatches, is now published. By order of the lion T ble the Governor in Council, J. F. WILLOUGHBY, Secretary to Government. To The Adjutant General of the army, Bombay. Sir, I have the honour to report for the information of the Commander of the Forces, that as soon as the Ships got outside the Harbour of Bombay, I received from Captain •^rnith, of trie noyai Navy a letter SC from Mr. secretary * Willoughoy, directing me to proceed with the expedition to Vingorla, and to land the Troops there if necessary. Fortunately on the arrival of the ^edition off Vingorla it was ascertained that the Troops were not required, and the Expedition nade for its original destination, which it reached on the 16th January 1839. — I irmedlately communicated with Commander Haines, the political authority there, and proceeded to consult with Captain Smith, on the Plan of attack, which was decided should take place on the Eastern side. — The Ships of War to Bombard the Fortified Island and Town, whilst the Troops embarked on the Boats were to be under the lee of the Ships of War and push off for the snore at a preconcerted signal: as soon as i received Captain Smith*s disposition of the Boats, I issued an order for the disembarkation of the Troops on the/-the 17tli, in company with Captain ^loith and Lieutenant Western, nginoers, I reoonnMitBed the northern Pass, and. it was agreed to attemtt to land on an Island about eight hundred yards from the Pass, two twelve pounder Howitzers, with a proportion of Artillery, and one hundred Men to protect titan, which would have distracted the attention of the Snemy, have prevented ingress into trie Town and formed a diversion when the attack was made on the Eastern side. — It was attempted the same night, hut unfortunately failed. — The Guns proving too heavy to enable the Boats to reach the island at low water. On the morning of the 18th the expedition sailed lor the Eastern Bay, and anchored there the same evening. Early on the morning of the isth the signal having been made from the Frigate, that the landing would be attempted, the reserve consisting of 35 European Infantry, 177 of Golandauze and 24th negirnent Native Infantry, was nut on board the Hen'hie Company's sloop of War 'Coote”, and both divisions were embarked as soon as the Boats returned, the right, oorananded by Major c^burne, consisting of 276 Muskets of the Bombay European Regiment; the left, under Captain Morris, consisting of 30 muskets of the 24th Regiment Native infantry: at 9 A.M. the Men of t*ar, having taken up their positions, Her Majesty's Frigate 'Vola^Jy* Brig 'Cruizer' and Gun Boat on the Northern side of the Fortified island, and the Hon’ble Company's Bioop of War 'Coote'*, and Bchooner 'Myhi' on the Southern siae; they opened a tremendous fire on the lower Battery and Town, which very soon silenced the Enemies fl nactax Guns.—At &amp; past 11 the signal was made for the Boats to push off and land, which both Divisions effected under a fire from the Matchlock Men, which wounded two Mon, European Regiment, in the Right Division, and killed one private and wounded one© one Private and a Bugler of the 34th Hegiment Native Infantry In the Left Division, with which I landed. Both Divisions formed un in the most steady manner and advanced through the Town, the Lnemy retiring before them. — The Bombay European Regiment seized on the Sultan’s Palace, and planted the British Flag on the top of it. — On debouching from the Town, a Flag of Truce was hoisted at Hydroos, the principal Mahomedan Mosque, where all the Inhabitants, both male and female, had sought protection. — The halt was immediately sounded and I advanced with a White Flag, met the Mahctnedan iriest and explained to him, through my Arab Interpreter, that none of the Inhabitants should he toughed, to keep all unarmed people and females with him at the Mosque, and to collect any arms there might he, and deliver them to Lieutenant Evans, European Regiment, whom I posted with a Picquet of 30 Europeans a little to the right and within 300 yards of Hydroos, with instructions not to approach the Mosque. — At the Western end of the Town, within 200 yards of the abovementioned Picquet, Gaptain Morris, having occupied a large stone building with the Head quarters of the 24th Regiment Native Infantry, hoisted the British Flag, having previously seized on the Southern Gate and occupied a Mosque situated half way between the South Gate and his own position. — Captain Willoughby, with 22 Europeans of the Bombay Artillery, hawing just landed from the Mortar Boat, took post between the European and 24th regiments, thus forming a seBlclrfcle; Lieutenant Evans's picquet in advance. — At 1 A.m. I proceeded with the FianH Companies of the European Regiment, under the Command of Captain Camming, to seize on the Gateway at the Northern Pass. — The Enemy still keeping up a desultory fire from the heights on our right, as the coluim advanced, but without effect. — On approaching within 200 yards of the defile, skimiskers were thrown out under Lieutenant Rose/-Rose, supported by Captain stiles, to dislodge a small body or Arabs who kept up a fire on the advance from the heights to the right of the Pass; a small party was thrown forward to examine the Gulley, and meeting with no opposition, toe whole pushed on the occupied the Gate which was deserted.— it had 2 Guns to defend the passage, a Picquet consisting of an Officer and 50 Rank and Pile was left at this Gate, and Captain otiles was directed to scour the heights on our left returning: the small column returned to the Town where I found (139) one hundred and tnirty nine Arab Prisoners, sent by Lieutenant Dobree, R.K., from the Fortified Island. I instantly desired the Arab Interpreter, to explain to the Shaik or Chief, that they must give up their arms, when they would be escorted to the Northern Gate, and permitted to proceed wherever they pleased; to this some demur was made, but at last acceded to, and their Matchlocks were taken frau them. In the mean time knowing what little dependence was to be placed on the faith of the Arabs, I directed Major osburne and Captain Willoughby, to get their Men under arms quietly in case of accidents. — In talcing their Creeces frouj the Arabs, they becanB alarmed I suppose, for several of them jumped up, drew their Crseces, stabbed the berjoant Major of the Artillery, in five places, and inflicted a fearful wound on the Arab Interpreter. — Some of the Sentries immediately fired on them, when they broke away in a body, killing a Corporal of the European Regiment and tm a Gunner of the Artillery, and wounding 2 Privates, European Regiment, and a Serjeant of Artillery since dead, the remaining Sentries fired on them and killed and mortally wounded 12 Arabs. In their flight the Arabs killed a Bhistie of the European Regiment. The Sultan, has since written the political Agent, that the/-tili .6 diorra amongst tno ^was occasioiiGci toy a Nagno Slave of his cw/n, who drew hi a ureeco to conceal it. Had it not oeen for this unSortunateli occurrence, so deeply to he regretted, the loss of life would have been very trilling. t on the Slst as the Inhabitants were Returning to their houses, the 24th Regiment Native Infantry, were \ moved baclc to the Junuua. Musseed.--* The duty being very fatiguing to the Troops, the picquet on the Fortified Island was relieved by the Marines of the 'Coote'. On ohe 25tli, in consequence of inforaaticai received frest the Political Agent, that the Bedouins were gathering, and intended an attacH, 200 Buropean and Native Troops with 2 guns under the coraiaand of Captain Morris, were ooved out, and occupied, the old Turkish Wall ®n tne Isthaus, which coBiuands the approach to Aden, but there has been no symptom of any attack, on the contrary, as far as I can learn, everything seems to be as quiet as could be expected, and provisions of every kind are brought in daily from the interior. The extreme regularity with which the Troops embarked and their patience while cooped up in. the Boats for up wards of three hours, reflects the highest credit on both Men and Officers. — i have to thank Major osburne and Captains Morris and St. John, for their unremitting exertions during the landing and throughout the day. in fact, every Officer has exerted himself to the utmost, and all I have now to fear is, for their health. Captain Willoughby, with the assistance of Lieutenant Western, and his Pioneers, has completed a Battery of Field Pieces on a most commanding Position in a very- short time. I am satis extremely happy to state, that the privacy of the inhabitants whilst at Hydroos was never invaded. nor/-oor has taeri boai a single complaint against aiiy Soldier, whether European or Native. , . and the Squadron under his Gomaand; Some L'ntciilocks were received from the Llahetuedan \ lest, and 40 unaimed Bedouins were escorted to the Nortiiem Qato'v/ay, and went Into the Interior an the 20 th.

On our arrival,we,without loss of time, requested Captain Haines to place in our possession all rough accounts, memoranda, and documents, etc. whether public, or private, which he might have, and might tend to throw light upon the subject of our inquiries. 3* As soon as we had received these, and on being assured by Captain Haines at our first interview with him that he had no suspicion against any one, and that he felt assured that the deficiency in/the Treasury arose from errors and amissions in the early accounts, 'N * J » i we commenced to examine the statement or errors and omissions which had been transmitted by him to Government through the Accountant General, that we might ascertain the grounds and nature of the evidence, particularly the entries in his rough accounts, upon which he had advanced these claims; and also to obtain an insight into the manner in which the rough accounts had been kept:- Since doing so, we have received from the Accountant General, in accordance with the instructions of Govern ment, further audits upon many of these items, and we beg to submit a general Statement marked D shewing the result/—@ they/— /V Classification of the items in the statement. at y&amp;aent relatiyeVesult of these audits, as also our oto remarks and to the errors and ) omissions. opinions regarding such items, which, from the nature of the claims, cannot be dealtjfi with by tthe audit Depart ments, and which it will be necessary for Government specially to dispose of. 4. In preparing this statement we have for easy re ference arranged the items into three classes, viz., 'Admitted' 'Rejected' and 'Possible, or still undecided'. 5. The items Nos.3, 20, 21, 22, 25, 30, 34 and 43, and amounting ta^Rupees, 3,395-15-7 appear to be hona.- bona fide errors, fide errors and omissions, and have either beer* wiTwill be, brou^it forward by the Political Agent in supple mentary Cash accounts. 6 .

Hobson. be, and can only be, satisfactorily disposed of by these Departments. With reference to the latter Class we would respectfully draw the attention of the Ri^it Honourable the Governor in Council to the remarks of the audit Departments upon items No. 23,44 and 46. 7. The remaining items viz. Nos. 5 @ 11,13,17,18 19,27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 41 and 42 amounting to Rupees 34,358- 6.8 are those only which appeared to require to be specially noticed by us and we beg to refer to our remarks upon them in Statement D. 8 . Of these, the items Nos. 5,6 and 18. are those which were claimed against Lieutenant Colonel Hobson and which have been particularly noticed in the Govern ment Resolution, No. 369, dated the 24th June 1853: and we beg to add to our remarks already made in the statement, that we have narrowly examined the receipts, and thatthey/— Captain Haines 1 letter dated 15th September 1853.

Instance of this P they are without an erasure, and that we have not been able to discover by whom the word ’•Triplicate'* upon the receipts of the 5th August and 10th October 1839 was written; but we do not consider that it is (as supposed by Lieutenant Colonel Hobson) in Captain Haines 1 hand writing, and we are doubtful whether it is in that of any of his present establishment. 9. In reference to these errors and omissions we would beg to observe that many of the items have been advanced upon the authority of entries in Captain Haines 1 rough accounts only, to which we have been unable to give the weight we should wish to have done; for those up to October 1840, are not original, and in those subsequent to that date up to 1846/47, there are so many entries of disbursements on Private accounts mixed up with the public ones, that it is impossible to determine at this date whether the sums c^jjimed upon them were advanced on Public or Private accounts. Subsequent to 1847 the Rough differ but little from the fair accounts forwarded to Bom bay. 10 . With regard to the Rough accounts previous to October 1840, Captain Haines states that they are 'jSxtracts' from original books kept by Mr. Griffs which have, he says, been lost within the last year. This is much to be regretted for we conceive that, in an inquiry of the nature of the present one no reliance can be placed upon other than original/ papers. In Instance of this we would beg to refer His Lordship in Council to our remarks on item No. 9, of the Statement D which we have proposed for rejection. In the original Books the entries may have more satisfactorily borne out the claim, but as they stand in the 'Extracts’* of these books with the erasures and alterations pointed out in our remarks,from Account ant neral to Government No.lQ 2 . dated 19th May 18o3* Instance of Private advances mixed up with the Public accounts in the Rough accounts subsequent to 1840.

Doubtful items. / RouA accounts contrasted with the Pair accounts A t 3, and C« they go to corroborate the entries as made in Captain Haines 1 fair monthly Cash Account, and in the Commis sariat accounts and against the claim. 11. The claim (item No.32) against Mr. Willi&amp;BSt Purser of the Indian Navy, may also be instanced as a private advance which has been brought forward as an omission in the fair Public accounts, upon the authority of the rough (original) accounts subsequent to October 1840. It is now admitted by Captain Haines to have been a Private loan to Lieutenant Cruttenden, and as such has been abandoned by him. Ac* No. c? is another of the items brought forward on the authority of the rough accounts alone, but which we are unable to decide upon; as, from the fact of a receipt having been prepared for the amount in the Political Agents’ original receipt Book - we conceive that the payment may have been made upon public account, out, on the other hand, the receipt is unsized and the Cash was perhaps never disbursed. 13. The item No. 17, is of a somewhat similar character and has therefore been classed by us among the undecided items. 14. Having completed the examination of the statement of errors and omissions we, in the next place, went through Captain Haines’ rough accounts for the purpose of ascertaining whether other sums than those already brought forward by him, which ought to have been charged had been omitted, and for this purpose we caused Mr .Hynes of the Accountant General’s office, who accompanied us in the capacity of Accountant, to prepare the statoments marked E, ?, G, H and I, which shew the differences bet ween the rough accounts of the Political Agent’s Office, and his monthly Cash accounts forwarded to Bombijy, both in/—in detail, and in a Tabulated form. tends to shew 15. These statements prove that the total disburse- that the deficiency is not owing to ment on the Public account exhibited in the Rough accounts errors and omissions. from July 1839, to August 1852, approximate so closely to those entered in the Fair Cash Accounts as to preclude our accouhting for the deficiency by errors and omissions in the latter.

The statement J, is a memorandum extracted from the Rough accounts of all Private disbursamenus entered in them, and shewing a total of Rupees 96,369.7.6. 18. Captain Haines has stated in explanation of these entries that the money was all repaid by hiy , the larger items being met by sums which are shewn by the said Hou^ri Cash accounts to have been deposited by him in the Treasure Chest and the smaller sums were, he states, regularly deducted from the amount of his monthly cay when drawn by him. 19. Such may nave been the case but it is to be remarked, that, with the exception of the entries of the sums deposited by Captain Haines there are generally speaking no credits in the Rough Accounts in favour of re the^payment of the disbursements in question although against many of them it is to be observed such remarks as/—as 'accounted' etc. have been made in pencil, as also in Ink.

We conmenced by an examination of the accounts of the Firm of Neerchund and flmeedhund (coinnonly called Damjee) who had received bills to a larger extent than any other Firm in Aden. 25. On examining their accounts we found that, since 1846, Captain Haines had been in the habit of leaving a considerable sum, due on account of the bills and out standing in their hands against which he gave orders upon the Firm on various accounts, some on Public, and some evidently on private account. On Bill day these orders were, it appears, returned by Neerchund Ameechund who received fresh Bills upon Bombay.- the money on account of which was either left outstanding to be drawn against during the current month, or, was paid in part as shewn in statement M, which is an abstract of the entries in Neerchund Ameechund's accounts of these transactions, and attached to which are the explanation (N) which Captain Haines has given to us relative to them 26. On perusing these explanations His Lordship in Council will perceive that we have classified them under three heads Under the first head 'Satisfactory** we have included all sums which appear to have been paid into the Political Agents 1 Treasury against the Bills granted by him, as also all sums, which from Captain Haines 1 explanations, in conjunction with his Rougji accounts, and receipt Books, appear to have been expended bona fide on Government account. Under the second head 'Possible' we have entered all/—all such sums in behalf of which there appear to be pro bable grounds for accepting, cr, admitting Captain Haines* explanations, such as the date of entry of payment of a corresponding sum in the Rou^i Cash account approximat ing, although not the same as that on which from Neer- chund toeechunds* accounts, it appears to have been made by him* And under the third head 'Unsatisfactory' we % have placed all such sums which Captain Haines* ex planations do not shew to have been drawn for Govern ment purposes.

Among these sums there is one class of payments to which we would beg to draw the special notice of Government, viz. sums advanced in Company’s Rupees to Merchants upon the deposit, it is alleged, of German Crowns, or Dollars, which were, it is said, subsequently redeemed by them - The payment of the Rupees is clearly proved by the accounts of Neerchund Ameechund but there is no record of these transactions in the Rough C&amp;sh accounts, and it will be perceived by our Proceedings that Captain Haines’ Establishment state that Dollars and German Crowns were occasionally received as a deposit in part payment of Bills when the Merchants had not the Questions Nos.110, 111,128 and 129. full pmount in Rupees to pay in on Bill-day, and were redeemed by them in few days afterwards; but that advances/—advances were never made of Rupees upon the deposit of German Crowns, or, Dollars• The Eayment on 29.

Captain Haines says that the amount of the Bills in question was made good by himself to Grovernmant from private money of his own which he had in deposit in the Treasury from pay accruing to him as shewn in the state ment already adverted to as being appended to his letter of the 19th October 1853; but whether the money was made good as stated or not, the transaction seems to have been wholly a private one, and should never have been mixed with the public accounts in any way: the Parsee States that the accommodation to him, consisted in this, that he was paying 9 per cent at Bombay, and that he got this for 5 per cent. 37. This statement Captain Haines says has been pre pared from a separate Private account, and flhe purports to shew by it that, from January 1847 to August 1852 he has lodged in the Treasury the sum of &amp;. 67,185, from which he has met private advances inclusive of the Bills to Sorabjee Cowasjee, to the extent of Rupees 60,462; but it must be remarked that with the exception of the items shewn as deposited previous to January 1848 and amounting to Rupees 5,600, there is no record in the office accounts of the payment into the Treasury of the remaining de posits exhibited in this statement. 38. The separate accounts from which the statement has been prepared was not made over to us when we called upon Captain Haines on two different occasions at the oommencement of our labours to send to us all accounts, or, memoranda public, or private tending to throw light upon our inquiry, which he mi^it possess, and when subsequently brought forward we did not deem it a document to which, produced as it was at that stage of our Proceedings, much weight could be attached. 39/—43/-- another Bill trans action with Sorabjee Gowasjee noticed.

In addition to the Bill transactions with Sorabjee Cowasjee above noticed, there is another with this indi vidual with regard to the purchase of the 'Bark Seaton' wherein Rupees 3,887-8-0 appears to have been allowed for in part payment of certain Government Bills granted to him in A*D. 1044 the particulars of which will be found detailed in our Proceedings of the 6th October. 40.

Captain Haines adheres to his opinion that the deficiency is to be accounted for by errors in the accounts, and that the Treasury was never robbed-also that he has no sus picions against any of his establish ment. 41. Captain Haines states, it will be perceived, from the replies he has given to our questions, that he has ho reason to believe that the Treasury was ever robbed, and he adhere^, notwithstanding its having been pointed out to him that the balances were less in 1846, and subsequent years, than the present deficiency, to the assertion that the deficiency is to be accounted for Answer to Question by errors and omissions in the old accounts; and he also No. 143. adheres to the belief that it x x has not Questions No.145 &amp; 147 # x arrisen through the dishonesty of any of his Question No.143* establishment.

With reference to 'the playing with the Locke' described in Captain Haines 1 letter of the 17th October 1852 para. 3rd, we beg to refer to his statement, and -v 'kk&amp;t of his establishment, upon the subject, as given in their answers to our questions as per margin. From what has been said by all parties it is clear that, Answers to Ques tions Nos.16,41, 55,146 and 150. although the locks were tampered with, the Boxes had not been opened, and it is difficult to imagine that had Captain Haines had any suspicions of money having been Reasons for the improbability of the establishment being implicated also stated Captaih Haines letter to Accountant General dated 17th October 1852 para.3 and question No. 155. taken out of the boxes, he would have been so wanting in the most ordinary circumspection as to have failed to ascertain to what extent he had been robbed, and to have made stringent inquiries into the subject at the time. 44. The precautionary measures adopted by Captain Haines subsequent to 1846, and the state of the Balances in that year and subsequently, as detailed in our ques tion, No. 155, to Captain Haines, precludes the supposi tion that the deficiency to any extent could have arisen througu the dishonesty, of his subordinates; we were alive no tv/ita a tending to trace whether blame did not attach itself to any of them, but from what we could Captain Haines ascribes his igno rance of the defi ciency to his never counting the balance.

In hia letter to Government, as also in the course of our investigations it will be seen that Captain Haines accounts for his never having been aware of the deficiency by his never having counted the balance in his Treasury, but this seems to be an assertion on the part of a man holding so important a pecuniary trust almost incredible, a tind one which does not appear to us to be confirmed by the evi fjnce of his establishment; from whose statements, as also from the memorandum alluded to in question No. 152 of//-These estimates practically tanta mount to counting the ’ ' baj^a ance of our Proceedings, we are led to conclude that although the money may not have been regularly counted, eatims.trts by counting the boxes were, notwithstanding, framed from time to time of the Balance in hand and as the Treasure received from Bombay was always packed in boxes contain ing the same quantity, and no reports have ever been made, nor, has it ever been alleged, excepting in one instance, that on opening the boxes the contents were found short the counting of the number of the boxes in the Treasury together with the balance in the Chest in which the money for which current expenditure was kept 7as, in as far as the present deficiency is concerned, practically tantamount to counting the balance.

The state of the balance in 1846/47 (as shewn in our Proceedings) from which period Captain Haines took the entire charge himself of the Treasury receipts and disbursements, precludes the possibility that up to that time a deficiency at all approaching the present defalcation could have taken place; and the careful way in which the accounts have since been kept in Captain Haines’ own hand writing, equally precludes the idea of loss in that manner / subsequent to that period without its becoming at once known to him. /e also do not con- 49.

Even if it be true that all those advances were bona fide repaid into the Treasury, as stated by Captain Haines - the money is still deficient - is not to be accounted for in the mode suggested by him - and the matter resolves itself- into this, that, if it has not been extracted in the way we have indicated, then in some other way of which we have no trace; and that this could not have been without Captain Haines* knowledge and sanction, for however much we may, and do feel disposed to accept the statements of an officer of Captain Haines* standing and position in explanation of these facts, yet in the facfc of a deficit so large, and after so much time for inquiry otherwise totally unaccounted for, we feel called upon to submit for the consideration of Government that, after a careful examination of all the documents and |qac papers submitted to us, as well as with reference to Captain Haines* previous letters to the Accountant General and our own Proceedings, we conceive the fore- m going to bb the mode in which, we think it most likely that the deficiency has taken place./ Further explana- 52 • In addition to what we have already remarked with the^lassifica- 0 ^respect to the transactions with the firm of Neerchund tion of the items in the statement of t^nsactions with iieerchund Ameechund(M)* Ameechund, we beg to state that in classifying Captain Haines’ explanations relative to them we consiaer all the items classed as 'Possible* as admitting of consider able doubt, and that many of those classed as 'satis- factory' have only been so in consequence of their appearing from the entries in Neerchund Meechund’s accounts to have been paid into the office.

It is also a §^narkable fact which we have omitted to state when reporting on the Balances, that money was often sent for to the Broker Neerchund Ameechund, on days when large payments were being made from the Treasury to assist in meeting them at a period, when, by a re ference to his Balance, the Political Agent’s Treasury ougfct to be in a State not to require such assistance. Captain Haines denies being con cerned in trade. 54. It will be seen that Captain Haines in paragraph 4th of his letter, No. 495, dated the 21st October 1853, but the rumour on the subject appears to be Confirmed. V.proceedings of 22nd October and accompaniment marked Captain Haines produces the original advices relative to the consigiments of Treasure received by him. ■ t J ; The course pursued with respect to these consignments appears unusual. gives a most emphatic denial to the rumous relative to his being engated in trade, but the statement of Mr. Mansfield the Agent of the American vessels, as also the specie remittances from Europe received by Captain Haines, seems to be confirmatory of them. 55. We requested Captain Haines to produce, if he had them, all letters of advice which he might have received regarding these consignments, which he has done, and which we beg to transmit in original, with this respect. 56. The course pursued, even on Captain Haines own shewing, appears to have been unusual, as a Mercantile one; and/-*and whether under the circumstances stated by him a person in his position was justified in undertaking the office of Agent for these houses, which he seems to have done, we must leave for the consideration of Government. v«hi 1st admitting 57 . w© think it too extraordinary that whilst Captain their incompetence, Capt.Haines advarmlHaines admits the incompetency of his establishment paneral- for money to and ^ paid his estab- ly but especially of his Head writer, Mr.F.Griffs, he lishment privately. should not only have kept him on, receiving his public pay, for which he did but little, but that he should also have given him large advances of money on many occasions OO well as an additional monthly allov/ance from his private purse to him and two others of his establish ment, as will be seen by our Proceedings. . 58.

We received no information t or. assistance aunrg our inquiries. 59. Before concluding this report we deem it due to ourselves to state, that notwithstanding his professions,/—Lieutenant Cruttenden 1 s inability to render any considered —. professions! we received little cordial cooperation on the part of Captain Haines; nor did we, we may add, receive any assistance, or information from any one at Men to aid us in our investigations. We had hoped that Lieutenant Cruttenden would have proved of more use to us than he did, but we do not ascribe this to unwilling ness on his part to be of service to us, but that he, as he himself states, seems to have been studiously excluded from any share in the Political and money transactions at iden, and to have been entirely confined to the per- formance of his studies as Superintendent of Police. We have, etc., Sd. D.M* Scobie, Sd. A.D. Robertson, Commissioners.Pciitical Dopartacnt. No.16 or 1854. Our Governor In Council at Bombay. 1. Your Financial Letter dated the 2®th of July (No.46) of 1853, and your political Letter dated the 28th of February (No.19) 1854 informs us of a deficiency amounting to Rs. 281,979-15-8 in the Aden Treasury and of the result of the measures taken by you for investigating its origin. 2. The defalcation was discovered in consequence of your' having at the suggestion of the Accountant General Mr. Elliot (a suggestion made for the first time on the 29th of May 1852) directed that, conformably to usage, a Committee of Military Officers should be ordered to assemble monthly for the purpose of counting the money in the treasury, and certifying as to its agreement with the Cash Balance reported by the political Agent. 3. Previously to this period, that du£y of counting and certifying had been nominally performed by Lieutenant Cruttenden, the Assistant to the Political Agent who had every month certified that the report of the Cash balance was correct, although he had not once ascertained its correctness by an examination of the Treasury. The excuses which Lieut. Cruttenden pleads for his conduct is that the Political Agent Captain Haines had persuaded him that it was not incumbent on him before giving the certificate to assure himself of the actual presence of the cash in the Treasury but only to see from the books what was the amount for which Captain Haines was responsible; or, in other words, to ascertain, not the amount which was but that which ought to have been, in the Treasury. 4. This excuse is evidently no Justiflcation. The Accountant/-Accountant General at Bombay can ascertain for himself the sum due from the responsible officer at Aden, and the certifying Officer at Aden may not be competent to ascer tain it, but the Accountant General at BcmDay cannot as certain what money is actually at aden, while any officer there is competent to that duty. V»e should have thought that it would have been plain to Lieut. Cruttenden that if he had only to examine the books, he would not have been required to certify that he had examined the Treasury and that whether required or not, he could not honestly certify 'I have examined the Treasury', when he had not made any such examination. 5. Captain Baines professed to believe that the defalcation was only apparent, and occasioned by errors and ommissions in the accounts; but although ample time was allowed him, he failed to point out suuh errors and ornmiss ions, with the exception of a small amount, or to account in any my whatever for the large deficiency. In consequence you appointed a Commission consisting of Iwajor Scobie and hi’. A.D.Robertscn, to proceed to Aden and investigate the matter. 6. The report of the Commissioners is now transmitted to us, together with the orders of your Government thereon, 7. It is with great phin that we record our opinion, that the result of the enquiries instituted by the Com missioners lias strengthened the presumptive evidence against the integrity of Captain Haines which ha“d been afforded by the unsatisfactory character of his previous statements. While he has been unable to account even hypothetically foi more than a small part of the deficiency, his attempts at explanation have disclosed many grave irregularities in nls conduct with respect to the funds under his charge; and in particular the fact of his having made to indi viduals Unauthorised advances of public money. 8./-12/- 8. You have removed Captain Haines from the office or Political Agent, and, pending our instructions, from all public employment. You have also removed Lieut. Cruttenden from the appointment of Assistant political Agent reserving the quest log of his fulsure employment in his own (the naval) branch of the service, until you shall have received an answer to s reference made to Surgeon Malcolmson, who preceded Lieut. Cruttenden in the duty of certifying the amount of the cash Balance, aid whose example in that respect he alleges that he followed. S. We approve the removal of Captain Haines from Political Office, and his suspension from all employment; and we are of opinion that the offence with which he is charged x is of so serious a description and the presumptic of his guilt so strong that if there should be reason to expect a conviction in the Supreme Court of judicature at your Presidency, he ought to be arraigned before that Civil tribunal. 10. We, therefore, desire* that you will consult your legal advisers, and consider whether there exists evidence sufficient to obtain the conviction of Captain Haines on a charge of embezzlement or for the crime of fraudulently applying the public money to purposes other than those for which it was entrusted to him; and if you should be of opinion that such a charge can be sustained we direct that Captain Hair.es be put upon his trial before a jury. 11. If however, there should not be evidence to warrant that proceeding it is still very possible that sufficient proofs may exist on which such charges might be framed as would come within the jurisdiction of a general Court Martial.12. In this latter case, we direct that such charges he prepared, and that Captain Haines he tried hy such a tribunal. 13. And here we think It right to remind you with re ference to Captain Haines rank in the Indian Navy, that it is provided hy the i&gt;.ct of the Indian Legislature No.XXVII of 1848, that if on any occasion there shall not he present a sufficient number of superior officers of the Indian Navy to form a Court Martial the required wsscam number of Officers may with the sanction of the Govern ment he completed hy Officers of the Coapany's Army, or of the Royal Navy. 14. We shall not decide on the course to he pursued with respect to Lieut.Cruttenden until we have learned the result of your reference to Dr. Malcolmson, and perhaps some light nay he thrown on his conduct durirg the progress of the investigation with respect to Captain Haines. 15. We have made to Assistant Surgeon Naughan the communication suggested hy you, and we transmit as an enclosure the correspondence which we have held with that Officer. 16. We cannot close this despatch without expressing our opinion that your Officers of Account are hy no means free from blame in this business. Their attention ought to have been excited hy the unnecessary magnitude of the sum supposed to he retained in the Treasury at Aden, and hy the discrepancy since pointed out hy Lord Elphinston between the certificate ordinarily given and that signed hy Lieut.Cruttenden and they ought to have recommended; at an earlier date, recourse the usual check of a Military Committee of Examination.

Honourable Sirs, In your despatch of 14th June latt you expressed an opinion that the offence with which Captain Haines was charged in connection with the deficiency in the Aden Treasury was of so serious a description, and the presumption of his guilt so strong that if there vas reason to expect a conviction in the Supreme Court at Bombay he ought to be arraigned before thai^'rlbunal, and you desired us to consult our Legal Advisers on the subject adding that, if there was not held to be evidence to warrant Captain Haines being put in his trial before a jury, still sufficient proofs might exist on which such charges might be framed as would come within the jurisdiction of a general Court Martial. 2. Your Honourable Court will have learnt fron the documents fcrwarded by us under dates 28th April and 10th and 23rd May 1854 that long previous to the receipt of that despatch, we had ascertained from our Adwocate, merai amd Mr. Bone that we could not place Captain ines on his trial before a Naval Court Martial for ffences cccmitted by him at Aden whilst in Civil Employ, and that our Law Officers had commenced proceedings against him in the Criminal side of the Supreme Court* 3.

We reserved all observations on the proceeding, until we are in a position to forward your Hon’hle court the Advocate General’s Report of the trial just received, and the Judges Notes which we are daily expecting. 6. as Captain HaiiES did not throwA any further light, at the trial, on the cause of the great deficiency in his Accounts, than he had already furnished to the Commissioners, and to Government and as we were informed that it .-as clearly shown at the trial that Captain Haines had employed the public money for his own. private purposes, we deemed it our duty to direct Mr. Acland to consult Counsel as to the nature of the Civil remedy we might possess against Captain Haines, and to proceed accordingly. 7. A Civil Action has consequently been commenced agx against Captain Haines for the recovery of the unexplained deficiency for which he had, throughout his correspondence with the Accountant General, admitted himself to be liable, and the trial is now pending. 8. When authorizing the Honourable Company*s Solicitor to act on the advice which he might obtain from Counsel, we deemed it right to remind him that, as the matter been placed in the hands of our Law Officers, the res- ponslbility of guarding against Captain Haines quitting the limits of Her Majesty's Supreme Court rested with them.

To Captain ^.b.H aines I.N., Political Agent at Aden. air, His Lordship in Council oas had under consideration the proceedings of the Committee on the deficiency in the Aden treasury. 2. The deficiency amounting to Rupees 2,81,979-15-8 is attributed by you to errors, and omissions in the accounts, but notwithstanding the simple character of the accounts required to be kept by you, and the ample time and assistance which have been allowed, you have only attempted to shew errors and omissions aggregating Rupees 80,474-15-8, of which, items amounting to/| I .55,741-5-10 have been shewn to be inadmissible; Rupees 22,596.8. are still under investigation by the proper department, and items amounting to merely Rupees 3,395-15-7 have been admitted. 3. I am therefore directed to inform you that without considering the items still under investigation, you have failed to afford any satisfactory explanation with regard to the deficiency of the large sum of Rupees 2,55,987-8-1, and as it has been shewn that you have been aagaged in irrigular transactions, connected with advances on private account, from the public money under your charge, in mixing up public and private transactions, in advancing money on the alleged deposit of dollars, and in granting ■bills without reviving their equivalents at the time though they were entered in the accounts as received, and as the state of your rough and fair accounts, and your explanation relative to the money missed in 1847, is altogether most unsatisfactory, Government feels itself compelled to remove you from the High and Confidential appointment you now hold, and to report the matter in detail/deto.ll Tor the instructions of the Honourable the court of Directors, pending which, you will remain unemployed in your own branch of the service. 4. I am therefore to direct that you will on receipt of this, raake over charge of the political Agency at Aden to Lieut. Col.

I am also to informtyou that you are held responsible for the whole amount of public money deficieiH in the Aden treasury, and that the instructions of the Hon’ble Court of Directors on this point will be comimni- cated to you when received. • • 6.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of a memorial to Captain S.B. Haines, Royal Indian Navy. 2. As you know, Captain Haines was chiefly responsible for the capture of Aden on 18th January 1839 and was subsequently the first Resident of Aden, a post which he held for 15 years, and it was he who, duri^jbhi* period, laid the foundations for the Aden of the present day, by organising its administration, encouraging and increasing its trade and establishing good relations with the Arab*. Chiefs of the interior. 3. There is at present no memorial in Aden to Captain Haines nor anything to perpetuate his name and I am of opinion that this neglect should be remedied. A former Resident of Aden, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Scott, approached the Governor of Bombay on the subject during an interview which he had with His Excellency on 15th March 1923, but was informed in a subsequent letter from the Secretary to the Political Department, Bombay, (No.0/2494 of 20th April 1923) that 'the history of Captain Haines is a matter for pity rather than for pride, and the Government thinks it better that it should not be commemoratedI enclose a copy of this letter. 4. I am inclined to think that on that occasion the Government of Bombay took an unduly adverse view of Captain Haines’s record and had rjegard to his negligence in failing to keep proper accounts - negligence of which he was acquittted of any criminal intention - rather than to his fifteeen yearA successful service as an Administrator and Political fteprsentative, and his achievement as the founder of an outpost of/the British. Qnpixe, th.e.first acquired ,in. the reign of Queen Vicucfria, which is now Id f such importance on our sea communications with the East.. *.. 5. As regards the defalcations in Captain Haines’s accounts, it is probable that in those early days he was inadequatley and inefficiently staffed while he himself, a Sailor who had wpent a great deal of his time* at sea, had pos ioly little knowledge of accounts or their supervision, apart from the fact that he must have been too overburdened with work and other important duties to be able to give sufficient personal attention to them. 6. It is now less than three years to the centefe-vry of the capture of Aden by the British, an occasion that seems to me to be an appropriate one on which to honour the memory of the man who directed the operation, and I recommend that steps be taken to arrange for a memorial to Captain Haines which could be opened or founded on the day of the centenary Before submitting detailed proposals for a memorial, I shall be grateful to know whether my suggestion meets with the approval of the Government of India. 7. I am submitting this proposal at this early date, as any suitable memorial will need considerable capital of public subscriptions, if the x suggestion, expenditure and also possible endowment, and the Collection/ is approved, should, I consider, be commenced as soon as possible. 8. With the consent of Mr. Framroze H. C. Dinshaw, O.B.E., of the firm of Cowasji Dinshaw and Brothers, I enclose a copy of a letter written by Captain Haines to the head of the firm in 1854. This letter indicates the esteem in which Captain Haines was apparently held, bot(^ by Europeans and Indian^ and the satisfaction evinced by those who recognised the value of his long service when he was acquitted of the criminal accusation brought against him. 9.

HAINES.No, 0/2494, Mahableshwar, 20th April 1923, My dear Scott, After your interview with His Excellency on the 13th March, Ivas told to look up the records about the capture of Aden, It seems that Captain Haines was at Aden for 15 years, from its capture in 1839 until he was relieved of his office in 1854, During that time defalcations of 2 i lakhs occurred, of which he failed to give any explanation. There was not enough evidence to prove that he had misappropriated it, and so he was acquitted on the criminal charges brought against him, but he was dismiaed from the service of the Hon*ble the -East Indian Company, was ordered by the Civil Courts to pay the deficiency, and was imprisoned for at least 5 years on account of his failure to do so. 2, Had the capture of Aden been a great feat of arms, it might have been generous to commemorate it by a monu ment, and to overlook the melancholy end of the captor’s career. The records however show that after somfi four months spent in negotiations, the actual capture was easily effected with only a trifling loss by a mixed force of sailors and soldiers. It is not clear from the despatch es that Captain Haines was in command of the actual opera tions, though he was evidently the guiding spirit in the preparation of the plans for the assault. 3. Altogether, the history of Captain Haines i s a matter Ibr pity rather than for pride, and the G-ovemor thinks it better that it should not be commemorated. Yours sincerely, Sd/- Major-General T. ii.
