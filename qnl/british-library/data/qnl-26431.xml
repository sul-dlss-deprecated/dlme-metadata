If difficulty arose, he would himself have sought the assurance preliminary to the opening of negotiations that the basis of Bermuda was acceptable# I gathered from Mr. Nehru that the Government of India would like us to negotiate in elhi.

Strand, W.C.2* 1st December, 19^7* CTV 1U639It may be that the textual changes in the Indian draft, from the Bernuda form or more particularly from the India - U.S* Agreement, are only 'editorial”* They can, however, be read as representing a change of policy on the part of the Government of India and as an intention to depart from x*he Bermuda principles in favour, for instance, of some form of pre-determination ^f capacity and division of traffic between the airlines of the two countries in fixed proportions* It has frequently been stated in public that the Bermuda principles - i*e*, the principles governing capacity embodied in the U.S. - U*K. Agreement of Bermuda (11th February, 19M&gt;) - represent the policy of H.M.G. Understandings have been mutually reached with other countries, notably the TT.S., that this policy will continue* Article 6 of the U.K* draft C.M.B.1A is a development of these principles* Moreover, it is a reasonable expectation that on these general principles, the Government of India will not treat us differently to the U.S. ’ Taking the Indian draftj- (i) In Article IVA, the Indian draft uses the expression 'equal rights'* In the Indian - U.S* Agreement (Article IVA) 'equal opportunity' is used. In the Bermuda Agreement, the Clause (para* 4) is - 'That there shall be a fair and equal opportunity for the carriers of the two nations to operate on any route between their respective territories (as defined in the /Agreement) covered by the Agreement and its Annex.' Does 'rights' mean more than 'opportunity'? Conceivably it might mean a definite right to a half -share of traffic, virtually removing «1J competition. The meaning is made more obscure by such words as 'maximum capacity permitted' in Article IVB• On the other hand, the draft does not expressly put forward provisions for the pre-determination of capacity or for its division in any fixed proportion between the airlines of the two countries. It is possible that no such restrictions are intended. We hope , not, but the phrases oast a cloud over the intentions of the draft. (ii) In Article IVB, there is a provision that an airline shall withdraw additional capacity. The Clause deals with the adjustment of capacity when one airline has started from an initial disadvantage. At Bermuda, the circumstances were the aftermath of war* The Clause runs (para* 7) - x 'That, in so far as the air carrier or carriers of cue Government may be temporarily prevented through difficulties arising from the War from taking immediate advantage of the opportunity referred to in paragraph (if) above, the situation shall be reviewed between the Governments with the object of facilitating the necessary development, as soon as the air carrier or carriers of the first Government is or are in a position increasingly to make their proper contribution to the service'* Such clauses have been incorporated in later Agreements to meet the condition in which one airline was less advanced or less established than Hie other* The clause in the U.K. - Brazil Agreement (Annex VI) runs:- 'If the designated airline or airlines of one Contracting Party is or are terproarlly unable, for reasons within the control of the other Contracting Party, to take advantage of the provisions of /sub-paragraphsub-paragraph (b) of paragraph IV above, the Contracting Parties shall review the situation with the object of assisting the said airline or airlines to take full advantage of the fair and equal opportunity to participate in the services, &amp;a provided by that sub- paragraph'# The India - 7 I.S. a greement puts it in Article HB - 'To the extent that the airlines of one of the Contracting Parties are temporarily unable to take advantage of suoh opportunities as a result of the Wart the situation will be mutually examined by the two Tarties for tl*e purpose of aiding as soon as possible the airlines concerned increasingly to make their proper contribution to the service a contemplated'# To introduce a specific provision for withdrawal is going too far# The method of adjustment must depend on the actual circumstances and it Is iimpossible in advance, without kncsrledge of the ciroumstances, to say how the case can appropriately be dealt with# withdrawal a&amp;y be entirely unreasonable# For instance, an airline might have expended much money in building up a service# k withdrawal may be quite unnecessary if air transport is attracting and creating traffic# (iii) Prom Article TVS, the requirements of through airline operation tare omitted as one of the factors by which capacity shall be related (see Article IVK (2) of the India - t?«S« Agreement)# It is Just conceivable that India are introducing an essential * restriction on Fifth Freedom# At the recent conference at Geneva on the multilateral, their delegate voted for the resolution that a state could unilaterally deny the ' , ifth Freedom privilege, on which the Conference broke down# The issue is explained in the attached note on the Geneva Conference# It does not, however, follow that India would wish to pursue this line into bilateral negotiations# There was much misunderstanding in the background of Genevm and the subject there was a multilateral agreement which must be discussed further in ICAO# India herself is likely to want Fifth Freedom in other oountriea - e#g.

TO: The High Commissi ;ner for India in the United Kingdom, India House, LONDON. New Delhi, the 3rd/5th January, 194-8. SUBJECT:- Establishment of an Indian Air Service between India and the United Kingdom - Negotiation of a bilateral air transport agreeme.it between the Governments of India and the United Kingdom. . ~ jr Sir, I am directed to say that the Government of India have approved a scheme for the establishment of an Indian air transport service between India and the United Kingdom. The broad outlines of the scheme are given m the Annexure to this letter. The service will be operated with Constellation Aircraft and the frequency to start with will be two services a week. It is proposed that the service should commence operation in T .ay 1948. Under Article VI of the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed in Chicago in 1944, the operation of a scheduled international air service by an air line of one State to or across the territory of another State is subject to the permission of the latter State, In accordance wntn nr-o^nt international practice, it is proposed for this purpose to conclude a bilateral agreement between the Governments of India and the United hm • 2. The present operation pf air services to and across India by British Overseas Airways Corporation is governed by the Bullock -Bhore A,-,-’-^^ n ^ J ' L t which was concluded in 1932, as modified by the provisions of the Empire a. Kail Scheme. The Empire Air Mail Scheme was formally abandoned with from the 1st April 1947 and it was agreed thdt the operation of British ax.- services to and across India would from tha1&gt; date be governed by &lt;-* bilatw^.. agreement between India and the United Kingdom as mentioned above. 3. I am to enclose a draft embodying the turms of such a bilateral agreement. I am to request that a copy of the draft may be forwarded to His Majesty's Government and their comments on it invited at a very early date. /It ...1 &lt;- i * 9 a ' It is proposed that immediately after a preliminary exchange of views on the ^ draft Agreement, any outstanding points should be discussed at a conference of the representatives of the two Governments held either in London or in New Delhi, as may be convenient, and the Agreement finalised# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sgd. ) R. K. NEHRU Secretary to the Government of India. • « ' ^ •• F \ &gt; &gt; i Vf 4PRESS NOTE INDIAN APR SERVICE TO EIJROPG GOVSRNI4ENT APPRC'/ES FOID 'AITCil OP NEW CCHPATfi: It is announced that the Government of India have approved of the early establishment of an Indian air service to Europe. For this purpose a new Company is being formed under the name of 'Air-India International, Limited', with an authorised capital of Rs.7 crores and an initial paid-up capital of Rs. 2 crores, out of which the Government of India will acquire 49 T? or cent with an option to acquire at any time a further two per cent so as to bring up their holding to 91 per cent of the total. Government will have a number of Directors on the Board of the Company. The Chairman will be a Director approved by the Government of India. The Service which will operate between Bombay and London via Cairo, and one stopping place on the Continent, will be equipped with the lei test model of the Lockheed 'Constellation' aircraft, the leading long-range, high speed, four-engined transport in the world today. The service is expected to be inaugurated at the beginning of May, with an initial frequency of two a wee in each direction. The frequency .ill subsequently be increased as the organization and traffic develop. Air-India Limited will bo in charge of the technical management of the new Company, and will provide crews and all operational and engineering services. Air-India will also act as Chief Booking Agents in India. Action will now be taken by the Government of India to negotiate bilateral agreements with the countries lying on the route. The scheme represents a new and interestin • experiment in joint State and private enterprise. Amongst its striking-features is the fact tiiat, as the largest shareholder in the Company, with a right to acquire at any time clear majority holding,the Government of India will have effective control ovej the policies and operations of the Company thus safeguarding in full the national interests including those of the tax-payer and consumer. At the , same time, by entrusting the day-to-day management of the Company to a sector of private enterprise well established and highly experienced in the field of air transport, the importruit objective of efficient management based on commercial principles will be achieved.— The financial terms and provisions of the arrangement approved by Government are also of special interest. Under the scheme, the Government of India have agreed, if necessary, to Tent subsidies to the Company for a ^ limited period in order to protect it from possible loss in the early stages, but any such financial aid will be re-payable from subsequent profits out of which 50 per cent will, for the purpose, directly accrue to Government until the subsidies have been repaid in full. During this period the Company will be precluded from declaring dividends in excess of five per cent. After the subsidies, if any, are repaid, -half of the profits earned in . excess of five per cent on capital and shareholders' funds ad 11 accrue t&lt; Go/t- ment who, in addition, will receive the dividends payable on their shares./ (h) . . . c s. a l 463 D R A F ‘IT ' » J AGRSE1£SNT BETWEEN THOl .CrQViC&gt;M-^lT OF JKDIk ' AND THE GOl/EHL^m^ OF THJ] UTHTED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTIv:; '' U: IR'^LAINJ RE I AT TNG TO AIR SERVICES. “ The Government of India and the Gov ernment of the United Kingdom of Gr --it Britain and Northern Ireland BEING parties to the Convention on Internati nal Civil Aviation (hereinafter referred to as the Convention) and the International air Services ransiAgr--- merit, both opened for signature at Chicago on the seventh day cf December, AITD CONSIDERING That it is desirable to organize international air services m a safe and orderly manner and to furtner as much as possible the development; oi international co-operation in this field, and That it is desirable to stimulate international air travel, at the lowest rates consistent with sound economic principles, as a means 1 promoting friendly unaerstanding and good will among peoples and securing the any indirect .benefits of this form of transportation to the common welfare of Doth countries.
