A second incomplete foliation sequence runs between ff. 57-91: these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and can be found in the same position as the main sequence.

The report by Haworth states that the standard of the clerical staff of the Persian Gulf Residency was very much below that of staff in other first class residencies, principally because the terms offered were insufficient to attract the right calibre of staff. Four reasons were offered for this: the unhealthiness of the Gulf; the fact that Indian clerks were working overseas; the general improvement in standards of living, which meant that employment opportunities were available elsewhere; and the fact that some posts, particularly in the Vernacular Office, offered scope for dishonesty. The main conclusion of the report and the subsequent letter from Johnston was that members of the clerical cadre should be offered improved rates of pay.The file also includes papers relating to the Government of India's approval for a reorganisation of the whole Persian Gulf Establishment under the terms of the revised scheme, including nominal rolls of staff, January 1929 to April 1931; and papers relating to the appointment and pay, both collectively and individually, of members of the Clerical (later Ministerial) Establishment of the Political Agency, Bahrain, including some nominal rolls of staff, May 1931 to March 1944.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency, Clerical Establishment</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Clerical Establishment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000213#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
