'ESang' was informed that mails and passengers would be going aboard, at 10 a.m. q a., 30/11/44. The offloading of cargo was imisned at 1.30 a.m. and he sailed without instructions at 2 a.m., stating to the Supervisor on board that 'he could not wait'. . In the circumstances, the master of the 'Resang', then in port, was informed that passengers and mails would be aboard shortly after 10 a.m. At 10.10 a.m. five military passengers and the post office mail was taken aboard by our Mr. Pickering. No reference was made to the Agency regarding the non-arrival of mail at 10 a.m. as one bag had already been placed aboard tae 'Hesang' the previous evening. At 10.15 a.m. your farash arrived with a box of plants and one cover and he was sent in a car to the iwanama pier, to try and catch the launch. The launch, however, had left. The 'Hesang' sailed at 10.26 a.m. At 10.45 a bag of mail and a second cover was received. Mr. Pickering personally returned the farrash and mails to your Chief Clerk who stated that he thought tne box and cover might possibly have been in time but that the bag and second cover were undoubtedly late. yours faithfully. foi GRAY, MACl '/■t-jkit.tr p C&lt; CO , LI X Agents.v n , N o .3((/D-13/14. \ Political Agency,\ Bahrain, 5th December 1944.

Mr. Pickering came to my office after 12-30 noon with mails and told me that the ship had sailed.
