POLITICiiL Ko*C-XX3* KUWAIT. Tke 26 th March X936. From Captain G.S.de Gaury, M.Q., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon* ble the Political Hosidaat in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire. Iraq Government * s occupation of Bhaikh of Kuwait f s 1 and at Fao. Sir, I have the honour to report that I visited the estates of His Excellency the shaikh of XCuwait in Iraq including that at Fao on the 15th and 16th of March. 2. Before leaving Basra I saw Colonel Ward, Director of the Basra Port ?/ho informed me that the Iraq Government now expected him to begin work on the Qooly Camp at Fao on the land selected by him on the Shaikh 1 s estate, the right to which the Iraq Government claim. It is said that since ay visit some stakes have already been driven into the ground, constituting perhaps 'ocoupe tion'. I am asking the Shaikh to make sure of this point and inform me in writing. Port officials have certainly been on the ground measuring it up and marking points temporarily, as the Shaikh's agent at Fao told me. ^ / c i t 3. As you are aware from previous correspondence notably your Express Letter to Baghdad X09-S, dated trie 12th February 1956, occupation of the plot in question will open up also the question of the Shaikh's right over a wider area than the plot now required by the Port director. A reference to the diagram attached will explain the situation of the land to which there are no title deeds although there is a 'Sanniya' document from the Sublime Porte datedds.t? 6 Q. 14tM tuijalrsn l£2Q Tot 1 #M 8 wlioXe Fao es'fc&amp; 1 * 8 j tih© exact; limits of which might be disputed. (See para 4 of Annexure II to this agency despatch No.0-^94 of 15th Nov an be r 1954), Noxig occupation — and in the case of the F&amp;o estate it is about 100 years - is of course a basis of claim but in the ease of a patch of land allowed recently to fall into disuse the law, I suppose, might declare the land forfeit. The Shaikh would willingly forgo his claim if it were not that his title to other lands may be prejudiced thereby. 5. ‘The situation is therefore that the occupation of the patch of land will entail in all probability the loss of other land, or if the ohaikh defended his rights, bring to a head the whole question of the Shaikh's title and introduce him into a jungle of legalities. 6 * That the law is very involved I have no doubt after talking to Mr.Justice Lloyd at Basra on ray return from Fao. As I understand, very briefly and avoiding technicalities and side issues, Mr.Lloyd contends that the proper course for the Shaikh is to seek fapu deeds for the Fao estate on payment of a sum equivalent to the value of the land at the time of first occupation, the latter in itself a matter leadin to argument. Failing this his view is that the Iraq Government without delay should begin occupation whereupon the Shaikh could protest and sue the Iraq Government, without however I gather, much chance of success. 7. It might be possible to avoid all this if the Iraq Government could be persuaded to postpone occupation and order the Port Director not to proceed with the scheme for a Cooly Camp on the land in question. 8 . This presumably they would only do if they could be convinced that (a) the camp is not essential to the natural progress of the Fao Dredging station and (b) that the land is in any case probably not theirs but the Shaikh's. 9./9* It is perhaps not for me to say what is, or is not, essential in the way of Improvements at Fao but it may do no harm to say what I saw there. 10 . In the palm gardens outside the Fao Dredging Camp, there are a number of pise de terre huts of the type comraon ir Iraq, occupied by coolies and others employed by the Port Authorities at Fao. The huts are spaced out irregularly. This clean little village under the palm trees, I may say, makes a not unpleasing scene. There is a reasonable space, may be a hundj and fifty yards, between the residential buildings of the Dredging Gamp and the village. Bedyond the village the palm gardens continue for less than a mile westward and immediately beyond them and where scattered palms and old ditches begin, is the site chosen by Colonel iard for the symmetrical Gamp to which he wishes to transfer the inhabitants of the mud village for 'improvement of health'. That enthusiasm for accomplishment and improvement should lead to this move, I can well understand but that it is essential from any point of view, I should doubt without more evidence than my eyes gave me on the 16th March. Therefore I do not think that it can be reasonably contended that delay in the building of the Gooly Gamp would be a spoke in the wheel of Iraq’s progress. 11. Secondly with regard to the evidence that the Shaikh could produce to show that the land is his and that he would have grounds for contesting occupation, X found on enquiring locally that there is evidence to be had from numerous survivors that Bund 'A' {See diagram) was built by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, although it may have been repaired, and its alignment slightly altered (although not opposite the plot now in question) during the British Occupation and more recently during the Kaimakaiaate of one Hajji Ahmad at SIBA. In this connection the Degree Sheets15./ sheets (1910) nBy be studied. They seena to prove that the bund existed then, althou^jh Colonel Ward informs me that he heard of its being built about 1915 and ms therefore sure that it was then that it was made. Another map to be studied which shows clearly the palm gardan with various half cultivated patches ^asloVi?'

'T • L There is no second bund Uee para S of Ambassador, Baghdad's despatch Ro.38/g/36 of the 6 th January 1936) and I failed to hear of any local opinion to confirm the statement therein quoted although I asked the Port Directorate’s representative with me and Mr.Coaster of Fao if they could not produce it. Duch local people as we encountered and questioned gave their opinion forcibly the other way # (The Mudir of Fao has, I believe, never been asked his opinion by the Iraq Government or the Port Authorities). IS. last of the bund old ditches show where there were attempts at palm cultivation since abandoned owing to the saltiness of the ground and the attraction of labour away to the Port Camp. To North and Douth of the patch in question pa lias stunted by salt have survived and there is no plainly defined limit to the cultivated area. Certain cultivators still possess letters of authority granted to their fathers from Shaikh Mubarak giving them the right to exploit this land and these letters could be produced. 13. Shaikh Mubarak from this evidence was therefore indisputably in effective occupation of the land In question an built the bund (A). 14. Avon the Port Bepresentative at Fao, Mr.Coaster, admitted to me inferential!/ that he now acknowledged the Shaikh’s right to the land and hoped, to use his words, that he 'would not be jockeyed out of it'.15 • lt therefore seems to me that we have reasonably good grounds for saying that it is believed that the Iraq Jovernaent would not be enduring any hardships by postponement of the Gooly Cai^&gt; scheme and that the land, could the case be argued in a Court of Law, might be found to be the Ghaikh s; and that being so ask for postponement of action by the Port on the grounds that not only the Shaikh will be involved but the British Government too - should the case go against him. 16. Ls a reserve position upon which we could fall back there is the fact that the shaikh is willing (I have his verbal assurances only and shall not ask him for written ones unless you instruct me} that he would either give, or let at a peppercorn rent the patch of land required by the Port Directorate, if this would solve the difficulty.

S. 32453/12. 24th February, 1936. Dear Rendel, Thank you for your letter of the 13th February (IS 327/ 18/93), on the subject of the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens 2 . Constitutionally, I think that any proposal to settle the compensation question without awaiting a comprehensive settlement of the possession question should come to us from the Foreign Office, as the expenditure involved would be a charge on the .Diplomatic and Consular Vote. This, however, need not prevent me from explaining why we think that the question of compensation should not await a comprehensive settlement of the possession question or from making a suggestion as to how to go about the matter. 3. In his note of the 28th January, Humphrys told the Iraqi Government that if they would give the Sheikh a good title to the Faddaghiyah Gardens (less the Bashiyah section) we would contribute up to £ 2,000 to expenses; and that provided that full effect was given to this arrangement, and provided further that the Iraqi Government would (a) claim no arrears from either Sheikh, and (b) give a written assurance that no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on either Sheikh in future, we would raise no further claim for exemption. 4. We have a very definite impression that, while the Iraqi Government may in practice be prepared to protect the Sheikhs in possession of their property, e.g. by putting spokes G.W. Rendel, 35sq. , C.M.G., Foreign Office. in/in the wheels of inconvenient litigants, they have not the slightest intention of taking any overt action that might be politically embarrassing to them. If therefore we are to wait for a comprehensive settlement, all open and above board, it looks as if we shall wait indefinitely. If it were possible to keep the Sheikh of Koweit waiting indefinitely for his money, we should have nothing to say; but assuming that sooner or later we shall have to pay him, whether the possession difficulty has been tidied up or not, we had better pay him sooner, for the reason mentioned in my letter of the 17th January. 5. Clearly we cannot pay him without getting from the Iraqis a formal assurance with regard to provisos (a) and (b) referred to above. We think, however, that the Iraqis might be willing to give assurances on these points, since to do so would not involve any overt action that might be made the subject of criticism in Iraq. The suggestion we put forward is therefore that the Ambassador might again approach the Iraqi Government on the following lines. 6 . Referring to the note of the 28th January, he might say that it is now evident that a final sdution of the possession question cannot be looked for at an early date. Since the Sheikhs remain in effective possession of their gardens, (apart from the Bashiyah section) and since we know that we can rely on the promise made by King Feisal and solemnly renewed by King Ghazi, delay does not in practice involve any grave consequences so far as possession is concerned. On the other hand, settlement of the taxation question does not brook delay, as the Sheikhs are paying annually considerable sums in taxation from which they have been promised exemption. His Majesty 1 s Government are prepared to settle this question, but before doing so they must have formal assurances on points (a) and (b). If they can/3. can receive such assurances, they for their part will undertake to raise no further claim for exemption from taxation. (The actual drafting would of course need fuller consideration: 1 have not attempted to do more than indicate the line of argument). 7. As regards the form of compensation, we should he strongly in favour of settling the Sheikh of Koweit’s claim once and for all by a, lump sum payment, in return for which we should expect a formal discharge binding on his successors as well as upon himself. We do not find it easy to express an opinion as to the lowest amount that would be accepted in final settlement, and we should like to hear the views of those on the spot as to the figure to be offered in the first place. Ho doubt there will have to be bargaining. 8 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Clauson at Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

Will you please refer to Foreign Office official letter of 31st December 1935, No.E.7138/82/93, about Sir Archibald Clark Kerr’s proposal that a Commission should be set up to investigate all aspects of the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens in Iraq? f , ^ y r -i t 2* You will already have seen the Political Resident’s Express Letter of 31st January, No.00-3 of 1936, a copy of which was forwarded to the Foreign Office under India Office printed letter of 18th February, No*P.Z.1141/36, in which Colonel Fowle commented on Sir A.Clark Kerr’s proposal. From a letter which I now enclose, you will see that the Dvernment of India letter of 22nd ) Government of India have no fbxaiary, No.F.247-N/35. ) —— further observations to offer. / / We agree generally with Fowle’s views, and it seems to us that the important question of the composition of the G.W. Rendel Esq., C.M.G., Commission/ Foreign Office, S.W. 1.Commission may easily raise difficulties. But when you and the Treasury have considered Fowle f s points in regard to which the Embassy may have more to say, we can, if the proposal is to be pursued, hold the departmental meeting foreshadowed in your letter under reference and discuss it in detail. 3. It seems to us, meanwhile, that the most urgent matter is to take the necessary action for a settlement of the question of the Sheikh’s compensation for the loss of his exemption from taxation and that the best method of approaching this question is the one suggested by Hale in his letter to you of 24th 'February 1936. We agree with him as to the desirability of separating the compensation question from the possession question and of settling the former as soon as possible. If we could obtain assurances from the Iraq Government not to claim arrears of taxes from the Sheikh and not to impose discriminatory taxation upon him, and if we then proceed to honour our financial obligations by refunding to the Sheikh the equivalent of what he has already paid in taxation and by making a lump sum payment as a financial discharge of the promised/3. promised exemption from taxation, we should at any rate have accomplished a good deal, and should have disposed of the most urgent aspect of the whole matter. We could then pursue with the Iraqi Government a settlement of the question of the Sheikhs possession, pending which we might he able to regard with comparative equanimity a continuance of the present status quo in regard to the possession aspect, which, as Hale points out, is not so urgent so long as the Sheikh remains in de facto possession. 4. You may he proposing to call an interdepartmental meeting soon to consider Hale’s suggestions: if so we shall he glad to attend. Meanwhile we think it would he well to consult Powle, and if you see no objection I propose to telegraph to him personally on the lines of the enclosed draft. 5. When we come to discuss figures, we ought perhaps to take some account also of the case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who has been out of the picture lately. I see it was suggested in Bagdad despatch No.390 of the 12th July 1934, that he should get half what the Sheikh of Koweit gets in the way of compensation. But the urgent matter seems to he/'be to settle the question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s compensation (as I suppose it is doubtful whether there are in any case practicable means of enabling the Sheikh of Mohammerah to enjoy the income of his property or the benefit of any compensation?). 6 .

I, therefore, sent a Survey Commission to investigate those sections. Having satisfied themselves by investigation and close inspection, the said Commission have new reported (a) that the 100 Jareebs formerly considered as incomplete, do not contain palm trees, but that they were last year cultivated with palm shoots; and (b) that the 450 Jareebs of palm shoot land are all empty and waste, save an area of about 20 Jareebs, which was cultivated last year when shoots were set in it. Hence there is nothing in the last named land to be included in the incomplete section. I have therefore trusted and referred the papers connected with this affair to the accounts Department of this vilayet, so that proceedings should be carried out accordingly.

Lly dear George, Y ur despatch No. 92(1: 327/18 /95) of the 13th jj ebr'uary, enclosing copies of correspondence with the Treasury abouth the shaikh’s date gardens in Iraq. 2* I fully understand the opinion of Towle and the India Office that the ti e has coxae when sorae compensation must be paid to the Bhaikhs of Kuwait and Ho hammer ah in respect of their losses under the istihlaq tax But you will realise that from our point of view the danger is that there are few secrets in this part of the world and once that/the Iraqi Government came to know that the shaikhs had been paid compensation for their losses under the istihle.Q tax, any idea of a compromise settlement of all the question relating to the -haikh's date gardens would lose for them what little attractiveness it might have had. 3. In this connection I think you should know that there lias appeared recently in the local press, both in Baghdad and at Basra, a series of articles drawing attention to the fact that a sum of about I.B.30,000 remains out standing against the shaikhs in respect of taxation on their properties for the years 1928-31 and suggesting that the Government intend shortly to take steps to collect this amount.You know too much about'our local papers to take this sort of thing too seriously, but the appearance of these articles does show that the possibility of claiming arrears of taxation has not been entirely lost si^it of here. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowls at Bushte. Yours ever, ur N.Nendel, C.M.G., Foreign Office. nd.^rdi ibald Clerk Herrm KOTii; BY PULIxIC.a. xxGiiKT ■/hen I was in Basra on ' the 14th March, Holmes who was there at the same time told me that he had been dinirr' with Lloyd who was in a peculiar mood. He was, Holmes , drinking too much and after dinner was abusive of the foreign Office who he said had let him see when in Lngland, only a thirteenth grade official. If they couldn't be bothered to deal properly with him and de Gaury couldn’t take the trouble to see him he had a mind to give the shaikh’s case against him when it came up. Holmes advised me to see Lloyd and ”smooth him down'. Holmes said that in his opinion Lloyd 'felt himself losing ground in Iraq'. 2, I did in fact see Lloyd next morning. He was full of legalities and while talking about the gardens case said 'What is holding up ,vard? He ought to take occupation at once'. (I now wonder how far if at all he may have encouraged the Mudir Tapu to publish the notice which appeared 14 days later as reported in my despatch No. C-122 of 4th npril 19 26.) g, Lloyd incidentally talked about a Commission to go into the ownership of the estates in Iraq and when I said that it would be difficult perhaps to find suitable members of the Commission he rose at once and said must be. people with local knowledge like himself and Jar dine. (Jsrdine gave me a long lecture about the necessity of Kuwait becoming part of I^aq in Jul^ last, when I was in Beirut and before he knew I was coming to Kuwait. He and Lloyd were for long friendly and together in Basra and must know each other’s view intimately well’.) Lloyd also said that he was annoyed with 4with Dickson for not telling him in time that the Kuwait Political Agency was going to be vacant as if he had known he would have gone there as Political i.gent. Jhen I said mildly that 1 thought there bad usually been a military man at Kuwait he brushed it aside and said he could have had the appointment if only he had known. 5# The note following this shows him for some reason in milder mood, perhaps because he thinks he overstepiDed the mark or perhaps because he now has a change of plans and is about to be the 'benefactor of Kuwait'. Could he possibly have the plan ofbecoming (Settling Jezir to Kuwait? the diffi culties he 6.

Bear de Gaury, I saw Lloyd in Basrah and had dinner with him -about a week ago-. I attach an opinion that he suggested I should convey to H.E. Shaikh Ahmad. I attach a suggestion that Lloyd made to me in respect of certain lands at Pao. Lloyd f s idea was that I should convey to H.E. Shaikh Ahmad that the course suggested should be taken by the Shaikh of Kuwait as he (Shaikh) would receive a reply thanking him for the kind and liberal offer which letter would be an acknowledgement -from the Iraq Govern' ment- that His Excellency had proprietary rights in the whole area of land -from which that piece of land given to the Port Authority had formed a part-. As I do not know anything about the Iraq land affairs of the Shaikh, the above is no doubt much involved, hut I hope you will be able -with your fuller knowledge- to unravel the idea from it all. If Alington be still with you my Salaams to him. Should he care to visit^this neck of the woods (Bahrain) I would be pleased to put him up. There is much to see here. Ashraf is the bearer of this letter and will hand it to you personally. Naturally I have not mentioned the subject of this letter to anyone except yourself and have no intention-in any circumstances- of doing so. With regards, Yours sincerely.I Lloyd’s suggestion:- Sorae months ago (about 4) Col., Ward asked for a small area of land at Fao for the purpose of erecting buildings for use of the Port Authority. The land asked for is the property of the Shaikh of Kuwait but nis titled is not without blemish. Lloyd suggests that the Shaikh of Kuwait should write to the Iraq Government Authorities and offer as a free gift, the land required by the Port Authority. The reply of thanks from the Iraq Authorities for the gift would supply evidence that the Iraq Authorities recognized that the Snaikh of Kuwait had proprietary rights in the whole of that piece of land from which the Port Authority selected the small portion it required. ^ The land the Port requirecis not under cultivation and is practically useless unless reclaimed from the river. I simply convey the above suggestion to you leaving you to act or otherwise as you consider advisable.V Telegram From Political Re si dent , Bush ire. To Political ^.gent, Kuwait.

My dear ..atetaan, Holt has asked me to give yon my views on the subject of settling the affairs of the Sheikh of Kowait by a special Commission* In order to fulfil the following promise, given to the :&gt;heikh in 1914 'Your gardens which are now in your possession, that is to say, your date gardens situated between Fao and uurnah, shall remain in your possession and the possession of your descendants without being subject to the payment of revenue and taxes”, it must first be ascertained what lands are covered by the promise and then the Sheikh must be vested with an unassailable title. r fhe first part of the business need not have anything to do with the grant or correction of title deads. It in volves only an administrative enquiry into an area, fixing its extant and the recording of such claims to title as may be made. A survey is necessary and it would appear natural for the Bheikh to have it made, first of all, bo that he can present to the investigating authority a map for it to work on, showing exactly what he claims to be included in the promise but I do not know whether the Sheikh would be willing or able I to do it, or to pay for it, or whether the Surveyors, acting | unofficially, would be allowed to work in peace. The last I point has been suggested by Hogg who considers that, if anything is to be accomplished, the Surveyors would have to work under the direction and protection of the Authority charged with making the enquiry. That Authority may well be a Commission /and,- 2 - s ' J 7 y-' and, in view of the nature of it© work, it would appear eminently reasonable for the Uheikh to be represented on it; 1 see no reason why the Iraqi Government should reject such a proposal. Once the area is ascertained, the Bheikh must be granted a clean title. This would Involve the passing of legislation to justify the barring of claims against the title and, presumably, providing for compensation in suitable cases. Whether Parliament should, before the enquiry begins, confer on the Commission *© power to order the x^egi strati on and assess and award compensation, or whether parliament should wait until the preliminary enquiry has finished before granting the title or authorising the Commission to grant it, is a matter for discussion. To give the Commission power to pass decision© as to title and compensation with all the foi’ce of unappealable judgments of the courts appears to involve difficulties. For one thing, the decisions may be dis pleasing to the Sheikh and the British Government. For an other, it would be difficult to ask the Iraqi Government to confer on a mixed Commission the power to award compensation up to unknown amounts. It appears to be better for the two Governments to decide what is to be done after the exact area has been agreed upon and the amount of comx&gt;eiisa11 on has been ascertained. If the latter course is adopted there will be no necessity for legislation to set up the normals si on .because its decision© will not be of a judicial nature so ao to affect any public or private rights) but if it cannot get on with its work without the power to enforce the attendance of wit nesses some law governing procedure would be needed. I have spoken of compensation in suitable case©. I have no knowledge of any claims that would require to be barred by legislation except the rights of the judgment holder in the baehiya case and the pending action regarding the Faddaghia /Estate.Estate. I am only supposing that other claims may be found to exist* lours sincerely, (Signed) e*h. mmm. P» I would recall that survey and assessment, of a preliminary nutm^u, were done in the case of the Hallways. A mixed Ooisa»ission ^mixed in that it included a represent- atj.ve of the Hallways) produced a report on the land occupied by the railways for the purpose of enabling the British ana the Ira^i doirenu&amp;ents to consider what should be uone next about paying for it. The work of the Oomuission gave a clear idea of the problem to be faced. It was bo ox ear, in fact, timt it was distasteful to both oovernments, but that is another story. bate loan, lisq-Telegram R.27 From Tolitical Resident, at Ku«mit.

With regard to (b). It is the Iran Government alone Tfho are interested and they can deal with this area under the provisi&gt;ns of their local laws# X suggest therefore that a. Comission of two experts &gt;e appointed with e suitable staff of surveyors? one to represent Bis Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh and the Hher the Iraq Government. The terms of reference for this Commission would be to survey end report exactly property the Shaikh was in actual r^s&amp;esai^iLQf tG 2:djA» taking no notice of claims to title In any part of this *r&lt;- a which have been put forward. The work of the Commission therefore, involving as it would a mere administrative enouiry into an area, and excluding any legal questions es to the legal right of the Shaikh or claims to any parts of tills area, should be fairly simple* Evidence on this point would conalat of documents in possession of tm gn&amp;iim, snw ing, for instance, on wh.t lands he paid taxation to th* Turkish Government previous to 1954, and tm statement of witnesses* fellaheen etc. The Commission should be authorised to examine such witnesses on oath if necessary.

Any l^rts of the area which the representatives /representatives could not agree on being in possession of the Shaikh in the year in question, would have to be put aside for further arbitration, but 1 do not imagine that such parts would be at ail extensive* a tj &lt;y 4 * In the enclosure to India Office letter Ko*P#r#$ 5?0 of fund April 19 S 6 to me, it suggested by the Foreign Office, in their despatch to His Majesty* s imbasM-dor, that the Iraq Government should be informed that v tii$ feaj€sty , s GovermBent are therefore not in ® position to continue to bast* their refusal to transmit docaments for service on the Shaikh in such esses on the simple ground that ha is a foreign sovereign 1 *.

Secretary Eden to transmit to you, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His MajestyU? Ambassador at Bagdad regarding the rights of the Sheikh of Jfoweit and members of his family to claim immunity from ciTil suits brought against them in the Iraqi Courts. 2, Tue Secretary of State has given careful consideration to the arguments advanced in Sir Archibald Clark-Lerr*s despatch, as well as to the question of the best tactics to be adopted in negotiating with the Iraqi Government on the subject. The line which fir. Eden would propose to instruct the Ambassador to take in discussion with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs is set out in the accompanying draft of a despatch to Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr, and I am to request that he may be furnished with any observations upon its terms which Lord Zetland may desire to offer. 3. Mr. Eden considers that there would be advantage in keeping this aspect of the dispute concerning the lands owned by the Sheikh of koweit as far as possible distinct from the main problems of securing for the Sheikh a firm title to his lands and assessing the amount of compensation due to him in respect of Iraqi taxation. He would accordingly propose, subject to the concurrence of Lord Zetland, that the question of the instructions to be given to Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr in reply to his despatch of the 8th February should be/ Under Secretary of State, IMIA OFFICE.2. &lt;r t H be pursued without waiting for the interdepartmental meetii^ which it is intended to call shortly to discuss the policy of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in regard to the two main issues referred to above. 4:* A similar letter is being sent to the Treasury.

Pur &lt; Q'-' With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram Ko. 16? of the 19th June last, I have the honour to inform you that, in a recent interview, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs raised once again the question of the position of the Shaikh of Kuwait in regard to civil suits. His Excellency complained on the usual lines that at present the Shaikh was able to file civil suits in the Iraqi Courts through powers of attorney given to his agents, but that no actions could be brought against him, as he would not accept service of the necessary legal documents. A list of the cases which are said to have been held up owing to the uncompromising attitude of the Shaikh has since been forwarded to me by the Director-General of Foreign Affaire and a translation is enclosed herein. £. On January 22nd I replied to Huri Pasha that I had / / ■ / ^ * studied the Embassy files on the subject, but had found that no further information had been received since the note 'Ko.318 of the 14th June (see my despatch Ko. 330 of the 15th June) had been addressed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since, however, it now appeared that the Iraqi Government desired to pursue the matter further, I would, as promised in paragraph 2 of that note, make enquiries in the competent quarters. 3. You will observe that in the last two cases mentioned in the enclosed list, it is not the Shaikh of Kuwait himself who is quoted as defendant, but one of his relations* The fc,r d. { Right Honourable Anthony Eden, MC., MP., Etc., etc., etc. Shaikh 1 s/ i 'l : ! MShaikh's claim to immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts is made on the ground of his status as an independent foreign sovereign and cannot, therefore, be extended to cover nis relations. Documents have, in fact, on several occasions during the last few years, been served through the diplomatic channel on various relations of the Shaikh, including tlaryam bint Shaikh Mubaiak, and an attempt to serve the actual documents involved in hie last case mentioned in the enclosed list was 4. In these circumstances I would propose, subject to your concurrence, to inform the Iraqi Minister for Foreign ^ '“IL I Aflairs that there is no question of the immunity claimed by the Shaikh being extended to his relations and that His Majesty's \ -Embassy are alwa c prepared to forward legal documents emanating from the Iraqi Courts to the Political Agent at Kuwait for service on any Kuwaiti except the ruling Shaikh himself. I am very doubtful of the validity of the reasons for which Mar;, am refused service of the documents involved in the last case mentioned in the enclosed list and would therefore propose to add that, if the Iraqi Government are not satisfied with her reasons, it is always open to them to say so and to return the documents to this Embassy in order that a second attempt to effect service may be made. 5. The remaining six cases mentioned in the enclosed resisted by that lady, not on the grounds of any claim to immunity, but on the ground that she had received no legacy from her husband.Forbes's note is that the lady named Bahiyah filed a suit against the Shaikh in 1933. * 6 ^ / Iq . b 6. The question of the right of the Shaikh of Kuwait in international law to refuse to accept service of documents which require him to appear as a defendant in the Iraqi Courts has been fully discussed in correspondence ending with Sir John Simon's telegram No. 161 of the 18th June, 1935. After carefully studying this correspondence I feel that there can ue little doubt that the general rule of international law under which the Shaikh is entitled to claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the Iraqi Courts is subject to an exception in connexion with actions relating to the title of a foreign sovereign to real property owned by him in another country, and that the cases now under consideration come within the scope of that exception. I understand, too, that the Iraqi Government themselves ar§ well aware of this. On the ground 0 -i. equity, therefore, I am loth in any further discussions with the Iraqi Government to maintain the attitude that the Shaikh’s refusal to accept service of the documents at present under discussions is wholly justified in international la?/. An at tempo to do so would, in my opinion, also be bad policy, since it would almost certainly affect adversely the prospects of persuading the Iraqi Government to agree t© a reasonable settlement of all questions relating to the date gardens in Iraq of the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muhammerah and might indeed embarrass my now cordial relations with the Iraqi Government. 7. On the other hand, it is clear that if the Shaikh were now to admit the exception to the general rule and were to accept service of the documents connected with the suits which have been filed against him, he might as a result be deprived of large portions of his property in Iraq which he would claim, perhaps justifiably, to have been covered by the pledge givento him on behalf of His Majesty’s GoTernment in 1914. It would then be necessary to compensate the Sheikh for the loss of such of the property in question as might be found to have been covered by the pledges of 1914, and it would no longer be possible to settle the question of the respective responsibilities in this matter of His Majesty's Government and of the Iraqi Government on the lines of the proposals contained in Sir Francis Humphrys's note Ho.37 of the 28th ' January, 1935 (see his despatch Ho. 64 of the 31st January,/ / 1935) or with any modification thereof which may he decided h upon when my despatch Ho. 629 of the 28th November last has been considered by the competent departments of His Majesty's Government. In this event I imagine that His Majesty's Government would be unwilling to accept entire responsibility for compensating the Shaikhs, and that if the Iraqi Government were, as I expect, not prepared to accept a part of the responsibility of their own accord, would be obliged to ask them to agree to submit the matter to some form of arbitration. To this course there are obvious objections, and in my opinion it should only be adopted as a last resort. 8. I doubt whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs realizes the full Implications, as explained in the preceding paragraphs, of his request that the Shaikh should agree to accept service of the documents connected with the cases now pending against him, and I feel certain that he and the Iraqi Government as a whole genuinely believe that the Shaikh is taking advantage of the protection afforded to him by His Majesty's Government to adopt an attitude in the matter which can be justified on grounds neither of equity nor of international law. I venture to suggest, therefore, that I should be authorized to move from the uncompromising position which I and my predecessor have previously been instructed to take up in this matter and to explain the position frankly to the Iraqi Government. I should then feel much more hopeful of being able to enlist their genuine help in an endeavour to find/find a satisfactory solution for all the complicated problems nrisin^ out of the ownership by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Ifuhammerah of property in this country and of the pledges in respect, of this property which were given to the Sheikhs on behalf of His Majesty* s Government in 1914 , 9* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, etc., (Signed) Archibald Clark Kerr.4./ A N8 P.Z.2433/1936# E 780/18/93. Sir Alexander Clark Kerr, Bagdad. ti Sir, April 1936. I have had under considerai zi iiV jour despatch No. 70 (230/2/36) of the 8th February, in v,hich Tour Excellency raised the question ol the right of the Sheikh of Koweit and members of his lamily to claim immunity from civil suios brought against them in the Iraqi Courts. s', 2. The position of members of the ruling house of Koweit other than the Sheikh himself presents little difficulty, since, as your Excellency correctly surmised, these persons (however closely related to the Ruler) are not entitled to claim any immunity from civil suits in the Iraqi Courts. Further, the fact that, as mentioned in paragraph 3 of your despatch under reply, one of the Sheikh*s relations does not thih£ that there is any basis for the suit against her, does not, of course, provide her with any ground for refusing service of the relevant documents. The merits of the case are entirely a matter for decision by the Iraqi Courts. 3. In view of these considerations I concur in Your Excellency's taking action with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the lines recommended in paragraph 4 of your despatch of the 8th February.4. She question of suits brought against the Sheikh of Koweit himself in respect of lands in his possession in Iraq has been re-examined in the light of the arguments developed in paragraphs 6 to 8 of your despatch. I an advised that, as you yourself suggest, it would not be worth attempting to argue that the Iraqi Courts are not entitled to entertain actions relating to land in Iraq when the defendant is a foreign sovereign. It is not possible to deny that, in cases where title to real property is involved, International Law admits an exception to the general rule conferring upon sovereigns immunity from process in foreign courts, and His Majesty ! s Government are therefore not in a position to continue to base their refusal to transmit documents for service on the sheikh in such cases on the simple ground that he is a foreign sovereign. 5. In all the circumstances I agree that a frank explanation to the Iraqi Government of the legal position as set out in the preceding paragraph can no longer be avoided, although I am inclined to doubt whether this development will in fact induce the Iraqi Government to execute the promises which thqy have given in the past and lend their genuine assistance to the endeavour to find a solution of the problems connected with the property possessed in Iraq by the i b Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. The tactics/tactics to be pursued with the Iraqi Government once the defence of immunity has been abandoned are no easy matter, but after careful consideration I consider that it will oe best for Your Excellency to adopt, the following line of argument, 6. You should explain that the suits brought against the sheileh of Kb we it in respect of uis Iraqi real property would normally have come within the scope of the exception admitted by International Law to the general rule of the immunity from process of foreign sovereigns, and His Majesty^ Government would normally have been prepared to transmit the relevant documents for service on the Sheikh, Nevertheless, His Majesty’s Government consider that in the special circumstances surrounding these cases they are under no obligation to assist in the service of documents on His Excellency. In their view the Iraqi Government share their responsibility for safeguarding the Sheikh’s possession and ownership of these date gardens in Iraq, and His Majesty’s Government are naturally unable to take any action which would imply their admission of the right of the Iraqi Government to acquiesce in their subjects challenging 1 that possession and ownership in the Courts, His Majesty^ Government must continue to maintain their view that the Iraqi Government are under a definite international obligation not to allow actions to proceed against the sheikh in respect of real property in Iraq. 7./10./ !o f 4. 1 * Apart from this consideration the Iraqi Government should appreciate that His Majesty*s Government could not in any case assist the service of documents on the Sneikh in connexion with these cases* since to do so would clearly be inconsistent with their own obligations under the pledge given to the sheikh in 1914 in regard to his lands in Iraq. 8. After you have spoken in the sense of the two preceding paragraphs* I consider that there will be advantage in your developing the argument foreshadowed in paragraph 8 of your despatch under reply. Your Excellency could point out that, if His Majesty 1 s Government were to take a different line and to agree to transmit documents for service on the sheikh of Koweit, the result y/ould probably be a flood of actions against the sheikh. This might well prove highly embarrassing t o the Iraqi Government. S. In the first place the Iraqi Government, apart from the responsibilities under the 1914 pledge to the Sheikh* which, I am aware that they refuse to admit, are definitely bound by various undertakings given on their behalf to settle the question of the Sheikh 1 s title to his lands. If claimants are permitted without hindrance to bring actions against the sheikh the Iraqi Government will find it difficult, if not impossible, to fulfil their undertakings.10 . A lurther consideration of which the Iraqi Government might be reminded is that, if actions against the sheikh were freely permitted and some of them proved successful, it would be necessary under the 1914 pledge to indemnify the Sheikh in respect of the amount of his losses. His Majesty*s Government hold the Iraqi Government responsible for the execution of the 1914 pledge, and the result would be only to enlarge the amount of compensation which His Majesty's Government would feel obliged to claim from them, and consequently to increase the sum at stake if the claim had to be submitted to arbitration. -le ihe conclusion suggested by the above considerations is that the Iraqi Government would be well advised in their own interest to welcome any factor which resulted in holding up actions brought against the Sheikh of iCoweit in respect of his Iraqi lands, instead of. complaining because His Majesty's Government are not assisting the service of documents upon him. The fact that the Iraqi Government should make these complaints can only be interpreted by His Majesty's Government as evidence that, in spite of the promises made by King- Feisal and repeated since his death, the Iraqi Government are not making' any serious attempt to secure a settlement of this long-standing and troublesome question.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. 21st April, 1936 . 2570/36. f I am directed Ly the Secretary of State fpl'* India to refer to Foreign Office letter of 9th April, No.E*780/18/93 regarding the right of the Sheikh of Koweit to claim immunity from civil suits 'brought against him in the Iraqi Courts. The Marquess of Zetland concurs generally in the draft despatch which Mr. Secretary Eden proposes to send to His Majesty’s Amhassador at Bagdad. He considers, however, that it is desirable to obtain the concurrence or observations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and is accordingly forwarding a copy of the draft despatch to him by air mail. He suggests, therefore, that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr might be instructed not to take action until Colonel Fowle’s concurrence or observations have been received. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Treasury. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office,INDIA OFFICE, . 2570/36. 1 Y/HITSHALL, S.W.l. 21st April, 1936. My dear Rendel, Would you kindly refer to our official letter of to-day's date, replying to your official letter of the 9th April, No.E. 780/18/93, regarding the right of the Sheikh of Kov/eit to claim immunity from civil suits Drought against him in the Iraqi Courts? Although we do not dissent from your draft despatch to Bagdad, which seems to us in general to take the right line, we should De grateful if you could advise us further on one aspect of the matter. 2. Hitherto His Majesty’s Government have been refusing to serve processes on the Sheikh of Koweit on the ground that the Sheikh is a sovereign and therefore entitled to claim immunity from suits in the Iraqi Courts. Under your present proposal we shall in future still refuse to serve processes on the Sheikh, Dut for a different reason, i.e. not on the ground of his sovereign rights Dut Decause it would De contrary to the interests Doth of the Iraqi Government and His Majesty’s Government and would De contrary to the pledges which have been given to the/ Rendel, Esq., C. M. G. , foreign Office, S.W. 1.2 . the Sheikh. 3. So far as we can see, the practical position will thus he the same as before, even in the event of the Iraqi Government not reacting favourably to Clark Kerr’s demarche - i.e. it will not in fact be possible for the Sheikh to be sued in the Iraqi Courts because we shall be refusing to serve a process, and he cannot be sued until the process is served. de shall be glad if you could confirm this. Presumably there is no other way of serving a process in a case of this kind except through the diplomatic channel, viz. through His Majesty’s Government, and the Iraqi Courts will not in fact be able to deal with the cases so long as we maintain our obstruction. (There is of course the possibility that the Iraqis might intercept the Sheikh one day when he was passing through Iraq and serve the processes on him personally. But perhaps that is hardly likely.’ ) k* It seems a pity that we should have to abandon our straightforward position that the Sheikh is a eovereign and therefore cannot be sued, but if the lawyers say that is wrong and if the Iraqi Government know perfectly well that it _is wrong, it certainly seems futile to stick to it. However, the alternative line which is suggested in/1 3 . in the second part of your draft despatch seems, if what X have saidEtove is correct, to meet our requirements just as well. 5.

Despatch in reply is based is dated in February. A Commission or similar party to study or settle the Shaikh’s title in regard to his gardens in 1914 was then in the distant future. It has now com© considerably nearer and from the latest despatches it would appear that it might take shape within a few months. g # The Iraq Government have not yet raised, specifically, the question of the legality or not in International law of the position taken up on the Shaikh’s behalf in regard to suits in connection with land. Nor do we know how they will meet a frank exposition. That being so I should have thought it preferable not to commit His Britannic Majesty’s Government in this respect to a change of course, which may have difficult, if at present unforeseen, channels ahead, until after the Ooiomisoion has done its work. I agree with the sentiment expressed in para 4 of Mr.Clauson’s letter Ho.P.Z.2570/36 of the 21st April that it is a pity to abandon a straightforward position, 2 The ambassador’s letter on which the draftposition, but point out tiiat the premise in his letter No,P*Z*2570/36 of the 22nd April is now no longer correct, 5 * question of possession is not beii^ left on on© side any longer, and as far as I can see, the draft despatch was based on that assumption.

May 1st 1936 No.98 (R) oOo — Your despatch No.231.—' Proposals of Treasury and India Office seem to me to tackle the questions in wrong oraer. (See my despatch No.191 and my letter of February 25th). I feel that question of possession has now become the more urgent for the following reasons: 1. Faddagiyah cases have only been kept pending with the greatest difficulty. Ministry of Justice do not entirely share our views on Sheik's sovereignty immunity from process. Should a change of government occur (which in Iraq is at all times easily possible) I cannot guarantee to keep cases barred indefinitely. They could, I presume, be heard in Iraqi courts in the absence of the Sheik if necessity arose. 2. I am (gr.omit.) that I regard pledges of King Faisal and King Ghazi as being valueless at present time. 3. The present government may not be averse from tackling possession question in the near future (see Mr.Bateman 1 s telegram No.87). I feel that if question is not settled by Yasin Pasha's Government probability is that it will not be settled at all within a reasonable time. 4. If*Sheik did in fact become dispossessed of any part of his property as a result of further delay on our part in approaching Iraqi Government with new proposals effect on our prestige in the Gulf would be worse it seems to me than continueo. delay in settling pecuniary compensation question. As regards taxation see Sir F.Humphrys’ despatch No.162 of 1934. Both Treasury and India Office appear in error in assuming that Sheiks are being made to pay annual sums in taxation. they/ What5. 2. they claim is compensation in respect of losses of profit due to payment of Istihlaq or produce tax hy persons who purchase their dates. Viewed in this light I cannot agree that this question is the more urgent of the two. Indeed for reasons given in my letter of February 25th I consider that to' raise taxation question at the moment may prejudice the whole situation as regards possession. Liay I suggest that ooalford be shown the latest papers and called into proposed conference.

It adjoins and lies to East of bund running roughly parallel to Shatt al Arab from Eao to Abu Khasib and is claimed by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait as being part of estate at FAO which as Your Excellency is aware has been in possession of his family for the past 100 years. 5. On being apprised of humane reasons, underlying the Port Director 1 s proposal H.E. intimated to me that he would readily and willingly as a spontaneous gesture of good will towards Your Excellency’s Government to make free gift of such rights as he has in plot in question on the understanding that his offer should be without pre judice to his rights and title to his property at PAG. 4 # l venture to suggest for Your Excellency’s favourable consideration that this courteous offer should be accepted in spirit in which it is made. In that event I shall be happy to inform the Shaikh accordingly so that necessary steps may be taken to enable Port Director’s proposal to be put into effect without delay, ends.

Polit ical RQ S i^ en -t Uo.il. Foreign Office, No. 131. Kuwait, No.8. Dated the 13th June 1936. Foreign Office despatch No.359, June 2nd (Px cpei t^ ox ohainhs of Kuwait and ilohariimerah) sent you air mail. I have thought it prudent to roake discreet en quiries adviser to Ministry of Finance and Land Settlement ^fxicer in Baghdad. As a result I have reached conclusion that we need have apprehension about approaching Iraqi Government on lines now proposed provided Shaikhs Qan / v in v/riting that they can prove usufructoiy possession (TASARRUF) of all properties over past fifteen years. The overriding consideration from point of view of land settlement is not so much documentary proof of ownership but rather actual TASAHRUF over period stated. All that Shaikhs will have to prove is that they have been receiving regularly for past fifteen .years their actual ownership share produce of gardens. I presume this can be done by the production of their receipts or otherwise from their records. This simplifies issue very considerably and I am anxious to approach Iraqi Government before departing on leave to the United Kingdom on June 19th next. I am averse from reminding Iraqi Government at initial stage of our claim that we consider them bound by pledges given to Shaikhs in 1914. This would only complicate issue. I trust you agree. Important case is that of Shaikh of Kuwait. If you are able to assure me that there will be no difficulty in nis case over guarantee mentioned above, I shall go ahead with Iraqi Government at once. Land /Land settlement Officer assures me survq^r will be necessary and tiiat this can be begun before Autumn. adds that there is every reason for moving at once as longer land settlement procedure is delayed the greater is chance Ot iallure. In any case early representations to Iraqi Government if favourably received will enable ground to be prepared before iiutumn. Please telegraph reply urgent • -ProdromeTelegram R(?)

(2) If unconciliatory Government comes to power they will easily be able to embarrass Shaikhs by supporting claims against them wi th a view to a breaking TASaRRUP period before land settlement is applied. They may gc t o extreme of invoking In t nat case the (Mut.? eff ec t) of applying If there is no doubt about unbroken Tixo^RRUI 1invoking Iraq Law ur.derwhich no foreigner may hold land in Iraq.

As regards para 7 of your despatch 359, I understand that while in theory special Court should base its decisions on same principle as those adopted by Land Settlement Officer they do not in practice always do so. To overcome this difficulty Land Settlement Officer in Bagdad suggests that we urge that special Court in this case should be set up in Basrah (on the excuse that it would be serving convenience of all concerned) urd er the presidency of President of Civil Court there (Lloyd). I think we should concentrate for the moment on Shaikh of Kuwait, leaving way open for land settlement to properties of Shaikh of Lio hammer ah immediately afterwards. As we appear to have breathing space while Shaikh of Kuwait is studying whole question I propose to send my draft note to Iraq Government for your prior concurrence or objections by air mail. -Prodrome -^ ^ ^ w p — Telegram I.?. 0 .,??.

Letter No.R-5/106, dated the 21st Rabi 1 Auwal 1355 (11.6.36) from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait. Shaikh of Kuwait’s Date Gardens.In continuation of my letter Ho.R- 5 /104, dated the SOth Habi* Auwal 1355 (10.6.36), I beg to draw your attention to certain questions that arise in the courts of ’Iraq and are against the interests of the administration of our properties there. It is an established and in disputable fact that these properties are our own properties #iidh have descended to us from our fathers and grandfathers, a fact hich is known for certain to His Majesty’s Government, as well as to our neighbour the Iraq Government* But for a reason that I cannot understand divers obstacles are always put without justification in the way of our agents and officials working in the administration of the said properties. For example when some mischief-makers commit a violation of the rights of landlordship, instead of being dissuaded and advised of the fact, they are encouraged by certain agitators to wonderful thing is that this is the case even in the courts, for when we see the persistency of the fellaheen in their disobediences, and their incited efforted to usurp our rights and ruin our properties, we naturally have recourse to the courts, and our motive in doing so is to have matters reinstated in their origin. But it is regretted that these mis chief-makers meet of encouragement what entices them to continue on their mischleis, cine instead of asking them to substantiate their unfounded claims, on the contrary we are asked to produce titles of ownership* This inverted logic and the unavailing disputes both tend to our extreme wonder at these proceedings. It is well known to His Majesty’s Government that our Fao property agitators to continue on their mischiefs, adhering to any persist in the prejudice of our interests. The most does not bear Tapu deeds. This gave an opportunity to certa* means»In short I should like that you kindly bring to the notice of His Majesty’s Oovernmaat the perpotual injustice that has befallen our properties in the direction of utility as tito in the moral direction, seeing that we are landlords and so entitled to enjoy the full rights of ownership. i lease be sure that had we liked to give full particulars, that would have taken a lot of time and space. But we give you the questions in brief. @ 0.3?0 f\iix of coiii. i&amp;ence t/iiB.'tj His Ms.j©s1jy*s Government will give full consideration to these well loiown quest!on?:? ol ours^ as the season is approaching and agitations always arise when the fruits are hanging. It is wonderful also that some of the fellaheen claim to he not such but landlords* So to what extent should we endure the usurpation of our rights* of His Majesty* s Government to an early settlement of these toilsome questions* my request I, therefore,repeat/1o you to draw the attention -Usual ending-Telegram I.F.0.1927 # From Political Agent, Kuwait.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the service of judicial documents emanating from the Iraqi Government on the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with his ownership of the gardens. The Political Agent in Kuwait and the British Ambassador in Baghdad mediate the talks between the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Iraqi Government in order to resolve the issue. The correspondence also concerns the action of the Basra Port Authorities in regards to the stakes they have driven into the strip of land which is part of the Shaikh’s Faw property, the suggestion made by British Officials to the Shaikh to give as a gift a piece of his land at Faw to the Government of Iraq, and the Shaikh’s complaints against the Iraqi Government for putting obstacles in the way of his agents and officials administrating his properties.The volume includes records of meetings held at the Foreign Office, London, to discuss the questions of possession and title of the Shaikh of Kuwait, the liability of the Shaikhs’ properties to Iraqi taxation, and the British Government’s proposals for a comprehensive settlement of the date gardens issue.The volume’s core correspondence covers March- July 1936. The earlier start date given to the volume is a result of correspondence by the British Embassy Baghdad, which includes the English text of the Iraqi Land Settlement Law of 1932 (ff 145-155), which is dated 5 June 1932.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Al-Fāw</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Suit of court</topic></subject><subject><topic>Meetings</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Title deeds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00005e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
