Karachi. Dated*the 2nd October 1931 I went and saw &gt;fe.cJcinnon Mackenzie directly I arrived regarding the transhipment at eea question and explained to them our side of the business. I found Knott quite sympathetic but he said they had been forced into agreeing to this transhipment at sea as they were losing so much cargo which went by native craft direct and they had only been given this agreement on the con ditions that the cargo would be transhipped at sea and that the shippers would not be liable for any Bahrain dues. and I have always been of the opinion that the new ♦khanchiyah* was a mistake,at any rate for the RE stores because it was making the Port too expensive. It may be possible to to get them to agree to give up this transhipment if the ^hanchiyah* is removed and when they receive a reply from Bombay T will return to the charge. Knott tells me he cannot settle these matters off hisown bat and that he has referred it to Bombay and will have to see %hat they say.

Please submit to the Hon'ble the Political Resident your views on the question mentioned above. By Order for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.No:K/l4. Karachi Dated the 17thOfrtober 1931 From; - The Political Agent Bahrain at KARACHI To: - Messrs Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ballard Estate. .Bombay. Sirs, I have the honour to refer to the question of overside deliveries at Bahrain of goods manifested for Ojair and other mainland ports. 2. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation have,I believe given you the facts of the case from their point of view,an your Karachi branch have also informed you how they are affected as shippers. I understand that you have temporarily suspended these shipments,but in case further pressure is brought upon you to resume them,I think it advisable to show how the Bahrain State will be affected and the possible repercussions upon your interests. 3. The Bahrain State depend on their Customs revenue for 90^ of their revenue,and in their straitened circumstance) the slightest reduction is a most serious matter. The arrangement of overside delivery by the British India Steam Navigation Company causes a loss of 2 % ad valorem on the whole amount transhipped and these amounts have to .make good somehow,a probable alternative being the levy of Port dues and increased customs fines for packages short delivered At present the Shipping Companies pay no dues whatsoever, though they benefit substantially by the facilities provided and are able to clear their veiiels far more quickly than was formerly the oase. You are probably aware of the instance of a certain rice steamer before the War which was delayed for 56 days,and it is only the improved administratio14 T 2 * and facilities that have made such incidents a thing of the past* The levy of port dues at Bahrain vould probably form an awkward precedent,and one which the Persian Government might desire to follow though the facilities they provide are everywhere negligible, 4. Prom the express letter received today from the Hon»ble the Political Resident I find that the Indian merchants at Bahrain have appealed both to him and to my locum tenens regarding the overside deliveries.pointing out that the practice would involve the ruin of their mainland buisness* As you are probably aware,their branches on the mainland were closed by order of the Hedjas-Nejd Government a _ew , r e f ir8 a£0,and th,y arc obliged to maintain Arab agant, to handle their busineae there. Thia they do at present by selling their imports to an Arab firm at Bahrain while the goods are in Customs charge,the consignment being subsequently re-exported by the Arab firm to its agents on the mainland. Should the arrangement fail they oan always import the con signment (almost invariably rioe) into Bahrain and so get their money back. If.however,anyone is allowed overside delivery, the Indian importer is completely cut out,as he has no branch on the mainland to handle consignmente and is obliged to sell his goods for anything that is offered. As a representative of the Indian Government any loss of business to Indian subjects is naturally a matter of concern to me,and I fell sure that if a profit is to be made,you yourselves would prefer that an Indian firm rather than a Hejdi firm should make it. 6. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation have represented their case to you and shown the loss that overside deliveries will involve for them,but of course there is the question of the loss of cargo to the British Indian Steam Navigation Coy ■-o be oonsi (ered. I have discussed the matter with the Manager of your Karachi Branch,and it appears that he con- si'-’ere.i t'-a+. ' - e British India Steam Navigation Company werelosing cargo to country craft who compansatsd for the irregular sailing by greater economy of rates and complete aroidance of Bahrain dues t and he mentioned that the Arab shipper who had first applied for the orerside delivery stated that the rates had recently been enhanced. This is to some extent true. The Customs dues for re-export cargo continue at 2% ad valorem,the figure for the past 10 years (they were formerly and no re-export concession was allowed) ,but the 'khanohia'ia demurrage charge,has,since this simmer been leviable After three days and not after 10 days as before,and so if a consignment were to be held up in Bahrain for a day oz two by rough weather it would become liable to this three days khanohla which is roughly about 1^ to lb % on bag cargo. 6. After my interview with your Karachi Branch I immediately cormnunicated with the Financial Adviser at Bahrain and asked him whether,if you would cease overside deliveries be would be prepared to remove the three days khanchia on re- export cargo,in other words to revert to the former practice and leave the rates as they had been before. He has just replied agreeing to this and so I trust you will see your way to meeting the wishes of the Bahrain Government and refrain from allowing overside delivery. The advantage of it can only fet best be/temporary for^regulations could be devised to defeat such delivery within territorial waters,though time would be lost and difficulties would aiise. Of course,the Bahrain Government cannot protest at anything that takes place outside territorial waters,but these stretch a long way,and I feel certain that the delays to the steamer which carried arms and ammunition for the Hedjas-Najd Government two years ago,(which lead to some correspondence at the time) will make any repetition of overside delivery outside territorial waters most unlikely. 7.

I hare the honour to refer to your letter No:673-S dated the 10th October 1931 and to your letter to the Commissioner in Sind and to enclose a copy of my letter to Messrs ::ackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co.,at-Bombay,together with a copy of their reply to me which shows that they have now decided to cease the practice of overside delivery. 2. Upon reaching Karachi in October I immediately visited Messrs Mackinnon,Mackenzie cc Company who had originally sanctioned the overside delivery and discussed the matter with them. They did not know that I had seen privately the esopotamia Persia Corporation^ letter to them and were at fist disposed to create difficulties. Ofcourse,the loss of cargo was a serious consider ation but finally they agreed that if the Bahrain Government guaranteed to reduce their T khanchiya T charges they would recommend to 3ombay,with whom the decision lay,that no more cargo should be booked for overside delivery. 1 then wrote to essrs Vlackinnon,Mackenzie k Company at Bombay. 3. On my return the Indian merchants waited upon me and again put forward their grievance. I told them that 1 had done all that I could and advised them to renew their applications to Bombay and not to Karachi,who had not the power to decide the matter. 4. Messrs Mackinnon, ackenzie &amp; Company at Bombay then^wired to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation that the same shipper had offered them 5000 bags on the sole condition that they £uaran+2 . T overside delivery,and that failing it he would ship by other lines in future. Their Manager discussed the matter with me and a reply was sent that this could only be ^ bluff and that with the winter storms at hand he would be bound to ship by the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers. Messrs ackinnoh,Mackenzie &amp; Company then wrote saying that they would discontinue overside deliveries. 5. The news gave great satisfaction both to the Bahrain Government and the Indian merchants and it is to be hoped that the matter will rest there. I had been nervous that the extra ’khanchiya 1 would provoke some such 'affaire' but in the face of the Financial Adviser’s and Cirector of Customs’ insistence had not seen my way to force my view upon them. Both are now, however,converted to this view. The question is a complicated on one and our whole action regarding the Re Bxport concession has appeared to me ultra vires from the very start. This must, however,be discussed another time and with fuller treatment.

Under the orders then issued the rata of duty levied on goods landed at Bahrain and transhipped within 20 days to the mainland was reduced to while no duty at all was leviable on goods transhipped at sea which were not put ashore. The fact that no duty was leviable on goods transhipped at sea evoked a very vigorous protest from Shaikh Isa at the time and ms always been a sore point with the Bahrain Government. 2. During last summer aaue large consignments of rice were sent to Bahrain and transhipped straight to the mainland thus evading all customs dues. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government therefore addressed the Political Agent on the subje&lt; and stated that owing to recent improvements in vhe amenitiesof tho portf tranohipaeut at s«a had iucraaoad and that •ooia duas should hs paid on such go^ds in rsturn for the u«e oi the port* The jaattsr was referred the Political Agent to the Residency# and as Captain Prior was then coming down from Ispahan to Bushire# the opportunity was taken to point out to him that under the orders of 1920 the State was pre» eluded from making any charge on transhipment goods* S« I may mention timt not only was the transhipment of geode a lose to the State but also to the large Indian mercantile community of Bahrain# who were deprived of the middlemen^ profits# and they made representations on the subject through their head offices to the Commissioner in Sind and the Buyers and Shippers Chamber at Karachi* From Bushire Captain Prior proceeded to Karachi# and while there took up the matter of transhipment cargo with the British India Agents# and I have just received a letter from him in which he Informs me that they have agreed to refuse to accept cargo for overside delivery in return for reduction of demurrage charges by the Bahrain state# which was formerly leviable after 3 days# but which will in future be leviable only after 10. 4* It seems not improbable that this arrangement will evoke vigorous complaints from Arab merchants to I bn Baud who may be moved to protest regarding it# since, while it does not break the letter of the previous agreement, it could I think bo held to infringe the spirit* 1 cua therefore reporting the matter for the information of the Government of India# but unless Hie Majesty*s Minister at Jeddah has reasons te urge to the contrary X would suggest that we should wait and see whether Ibn Saud moves in the matter*••Bding a copy of tuio do a pr. ten to dio •tor at JadcUH and to His UaJoot&gt; , s ;&gt;oorotary I hare the honour t o be, dir.

Sir, With reference to the despatch addressed -o you ; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on December 14th, ao.C. 35 , relative to the transhipment of goods at Bahrain, I have the honour to state that, subject to the contents of the following paragraph, I see no reason so far as I am concerned to demur to Colonel Biscoe* s conclusion that nothing should be done to forestall opposition by Ibn 3a’ud to the refusal of facilities for overside delivery of goods at Bahrain and that he should be left to take the initiative, if he wishes to contest it. I may state that although the King has for some time had every opportunity for keeping in touch with what happens in the neighbourhood of Hssa and went there himself early this month, nothing has been said to me on this subject by the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. ' 2 , m endorsing Colonel Biecoe’s view, I am a good deal influenced by the general trend of the conclusions reached by the Inter-departmental conference on Persian Gulf questions held at the Foreign Office on August 12th last. I notice, however, that Colonel Biscoe writes as though the reduction of the Bahrain transit dues to in 1920 was the subject of some agreement. My archives here throw no light on the nature of this agreement, as this point had at that time •.. The Secretary to the Government of India.in the Foreign and Political Department.time no immediate concern with matters affecting Ibn Sa’ud. If the agreement mentioned by the Political Resident was one which Ibn Sa. 1 ud couldinvoke as-binding His Majesty’s Govern ment and/or the Shaikh of Bahrain vis-a-vis of himself, it would appear to be for His Majesty’s Government to consider whether the arrangements made by CaptainPrior could be held to violate its spirit, 3, I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (who will doubtless have received a copy of Colonel Biscoe’s despatch through the India Office) and to the Political Resident, I have the honour to be, Sir, .Your obedient servant. sd/-ANDRE# RYAN.1D3# f 3 * / / Te ic grain J*. l?rom 7orex^n and Politic 1 JJe^artinent , wewJJeihi, To Political Heeident , Bushire .

As regards cancelling the arrangement whether Ibn Baud protests or not, I woulc* suggest that this is a mutter in which it would be best to be guiced by U* opinion of Bir Andrew Kyun, after he ieia received the copy of the Political Agent's letter to Ibn Baud, b.

If direct tranahlprient wua adopted aa a re/tular practice and on a large scale it would undoubtedly affect the revenues of the state appreciably, arid this at a tine tf apecial financial difficulty when the atate is faced with a large deficit. Moreover it V\ would, as pointed out in my Letter l*o. C-3t&gt; of the 14th December, hit the Inuiun mercaritile community, who are also passing through difficult times. 6. As far as I am aware no particular negotiations are impenoing with Ibn liaud regarding uulf questions, and from this point of view I see no objection to can cellation. ' ^• wn the other hand Ibn ^uuo has not yet protested; and the natter was not mentioned at nasu, tliough I had long discussions with his Majesty's weeretary on many questions connected with hah rain. 8. To sum up: (ij Cancellation would adversely affect the revenues of Bahrain at a time of pecuitor difficulty if it resulted in a large increase in direct transhipment.

The Karachi manager informed mo,liowever,taiit he vjus unable to settle matters of policy without a reference to Bombay and that thou n ue ^ nadk personally did not intend to accept any more such cargo he was referring to Bombay,and advised me to w write to t^em too.

The Hon T ble the Political iiesident in the xersian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward a letter received from His excellency shaikh Hamad to your address regarding transhipment dues in Bahrain harbour* You will notice that he states his intention of denouncing that part of Shaikh Isa T s letter which allowed sttiy transhipment within Bahrain territorial waters. The letter on which His 1'ajesty Bin Gaud relies is Lajor Dickson’s letter No:196-C dated the 14th June 1920. 2. It will be useful in the first place if I summarise the correspondence that led up to the institution of the 2,* M diity. Throughout this despatch i will refer to the 2yu duty as the ne hxport or R£ duty,and to the cargo directly taken from steamer to boat or from boat to boat as tranship ment cargo. Arabs do not use the term HB but usually speak of tranship cargo ter that which pays 2^,presumably because the transhipment has hardly ever occurred. 3. Till 1913 Ghaikh Isa used to charge 5/o on all cargo but he then reduced it to 2*^ on. all cargo destined for the mainland but discharged at Bahrain# In 1916,on the excuse that the war had greatly reduced his customs he increased this to 5 ,* ,this enhanced rate finally leading to a protest from Bin Gaud demanding a return to the old rate or rather the remission of all dues except arthiyah or ground tax. His protest and a sumnary of the matter as it then stood was sent to the Hon’ble the Political Resident by L I2 . Political Agent in his letter No:58-0 dated the 28th February 1920. The Political Agent expressed the opinion that strictly speaking Bahrain should not charge anything on transit cargo as it was contrary to international practice. To this the Political Resident replied on the 10th March in his telegram No:553 that there was no recognised scale of duty on transit or transhipment cargo, and that most countries charged some duty based on the principle of not kiiling the goose that laid the golden eggs. 'This point is of interest and I will return to it later. 4. In his Memorandum No:72-C dated the 10th March 1920 the Political Agent reported to the Residency that at an interview Shaikh Isa had said that on no account would he reduce his duty from 5/o to 2$ in order to please Bin Saud. He apparently felt that his honour was involved,and said that when he had to reduce his duty for transit cargo in 1913 from 5&gt;o to 2$ he had dime so of his own free will in order to attract trade. When he had achieved his object he again raised it to 5/&lt;i and he said that he would not reduce it again unless forced to do so by the Resident. The Political Agent recommended that he should be pressed to reduce his rate to 2 ^ but made no mention of free transhipment at sea. 5. In his letter No:112-0 dated the 27th April to the Political Resident the Political Agent first mentions free transhipment at sea. The matter is now complicated by suggestions from the Oivil Goraraissioner at Baghdad that Bahrain should be allowed to increase its customs to the rersian scale and so recoup itself for concessions to Bin Saud,but the Resident opposed the suggestion of giving Bahrain more revenue on the grounds that the administration was so rotten that there was no guarantee that any of it would be spent on harbour in^rovements. The Oivil Oommissioner at Baghdad in his telegram No:6256 dated thei t ' J * * 3. 24th May 1920 suggested that tlie rate of 3K duty should be 2 or 2-^ and that nothii^ should be charged on direct tran shipment. This is the first mention that I can trace of a 2 /i duty. 6 . The matter now moved rapidly. The Government of India apparently agreed to a 2/£ RE Export duty and to free tran shipment at sea,and Shaikh Isa was instructed accordingly, Bin Baud and the Ruler of Qatar being simultaneously informed of the new concession. The reason given to Shaikh Isa by the Resident was that his former practice was T not in accordance with existing international law’. In his covering letter,the Political Agent informed Shaikh Isa inter alia that 'In other words,Your Excellency may possibly shortly be invited to raise the Bahrain Customs tariff to the extent of that fixed by the Persian Government. Should this take place Your Excellency may expect to receive a greatly increased revenue from your customs. Such an increase will no doubt be half as much again or possibly double your existing revenues”. 7. Shaikh Isa received the news badly and immediately asked to be allowed to return to the old 2*^ rate he had previously refused to concede. Shaikh Isa apparently also asked that the free transhipment at sea should not be forced on him. The Political Agent discussed these points in his forwarding letter No:228 of the 3rd August 1920. The Resident informed Shaikh Isa that the orders of Government must be obeyed,and sent three letters to him with his letter No:253-S of 28th August 1920 to the Political Agent. The first told him that he must carry out the orders of Govern ment without demur,and the third warned him against mischief makers. The second is of the greatest importance for I now find in its penulti ate paragraph that he informs QhaikKIsa that the free transhipment at sea is only intended to apply to goods that come by steamer. If Shaikh Isa had not been in his dotage he vould have produced this letter long ago and the difficulty of country craft discharging cargo directinto other country craft and escaping customs dues would never have arisen. Since it is manifestly unfair that the State should be ignorant of an important letter like this ovnng to Shaikh Isa T s incapacity,! propose to give a copy of it to the Adviser unless you instruct me by telegram to refrain from doing so. 8 . Shaikh Isa yielded before the unrelenting pressure of the Resident and finally accepted the terms,though with an ill grace. Shortly afterwards another question arose. Hitherto,by private arrangement,he had allowed baled goods to pass for ^in Saud T s territory unopened at a charge of Rs.15/- per bale, ihis was to obviate the difficulty of rebaling goods that had been packed under pressure,and since it was calculated that an average bale was worth not less than Rs.1,000/- the arrangement was to ^in Saud T s benefit. Shaikh Isa now ordered,however,that such goods should be opened to a$$ess their value and collected, ihe Resident declined to intervene,but the matter was finally settled locally by Rs.20/- being accepted instead of Rs.15/- and the bales were allowed to pass as before. 9. I now come to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad 1 s letter. It may be broadly summed up as saying that though all avail able economies have been made the State is in sore need of money,and since he can no longer afford to give free tran shipment, which,moreover he considers an infringement of his sovereign rights,he intends to cancel the clause of Shaikh Isa T s letter which allowed it. 10. iTiis action has been precipitated by two things. During this spring,return freights by country craft (mostly from Kuwait) from Karachi to Bahrain fell to unprecedentjly low iates. The British India Steam Navigation Company were unable to reduce their rates to meet this and consequently a number of booms,some containing as much as a thousand sacks of rice came to Bahrain and transhipped their cargo to smaller craft from Jubail and Ojair without paying a penny to the Bahrain5U 5 (rovemneiit. i’he second point is’that news has been received that a Karachi shipper offered the British India Steam Navigation Company 35,000 bags of rice on the sole condition that they will allow him overside deli very, i.e., enable him to secure free transhipment, fhe conjunction of these two factors has much alarmed the Bahrain Government and the merchants since they see their entrepot trade being conducted under their noses and in their port without the Government being able to obtain revenue from it or the merchants their trade. I should mention,that for a variety of reasons it is,practically speaking,only possible for Nejd and Han merchants to profit by this direct traffic, and the Bahrain merchants though liable to the competition of others in the home market find themselves shut out of the trade of the mainland. 11. Since Shaikh Isa’s letter prescribed no time limit and since it was not a formal treaty but a private arrange ment and since he received no compensating advantage,it is clearly open to the son to rescind a concession granted bt^. the father. Bahrain,as we have frequently stated,is an Independent Arab State and has a perfect right to levy such dues and make such arrai^ements in its territorial waters as may seem good to it. As I have mentioned above,the Resident himself stated that the usual practice of States was to take what could be taken without killing the goose that lays the golden eggs 12. When the concession was originally forced upon Shaikh Isa,much play was made of the argument that other ports such as Bombay charged nothing for transhipment, .hat is 0^9 &lt;X done elsewhere is of little value/jin a place like the xersian Gulf, which is a law unto it self,but apart from this the argument is fallacious for the transhipment referred to in these ports is that of cargo on a through manifest for onward transmission by another steamer porty Bahrain is strictly speaking the destination of transhipment cargo here,for the mainland ports cannot hy any stretch of imagination be called steamer portsror do the merchants who ship the cargo live there# 13# The Port of iondon and other great ports grant cheap transit facilities because it suits their policy to do so, and if they did not rival ports should soon take their entrepot trade from them. x he situation here is entirely different# The Hasa and Nejd merchants who import on a large scale do not live in their own country,but prefer to conduct their business from the peace and security of Bahrain# They take full advantage of the facilities of the port,send their children free to Bahrain schools,use Bahrain hospitals and enjoy the protection of the Bahrain State forces# Since the Customs dues provide almost the sole shut source of revenue in the State it is only reasonable to expect that they should be expected to contribute something to them# It should be remembered that no port dues exist here except on launches and unless Customs dues are paid the transhipment traffic does not pay a penny# 14. As the Shaikh says in his letter conditions have changed since Shaikh Isa signed his letter. Transhipment from steamers was/unknown, and he could not have foreseen (though we should have foreseen fear him) that as much as 35,000 bags of rice at a time might desire to make use of this loophole. It is clear that transhipment from country craft to country craft did exist (Political Agent's letter No:228-C dated the 3rd August 1920 to the Political Resident) but on the other hand it is equally clear that Shaikh Isa $0 used to collect^ on all goodsitranshipped. c 15. In view of the Resident’s assurance to Shaikh Isa that the free transhipment only applied to goods transhipped from steamers to country craft I presume that I may inform the Shaikh immediately that he is at liberty to charge the full 2/o on cargo transhipped from one country craft to another without any further delay,and this will only leave7. the question of steamer transhipment. 16. It must he quite clear that once transhipment from steamers is allowed on the scale contemplated,it is only a question of months before the entire entrepot trade is con ducted in this way,the local and Hindu merchants being deprived of their share, alt hough their Nejdi and 1'asawi competitors in Bahrain will be able to compete in the Bahrain market as heretofore. Exactly why the advantage to be gained by free transhipment from steamers was not realised and utilized earlier,! cannot say,but I believe that the answer lay in the reluctance of the British India Steam Navigation Company to allow it. They will always prefer to have their cargo landed by their agents in Bahrain,and but for the recent competition of country craft would never agree to any other procedure. Now that in the terms of Colonel Trevor T s letter,country craft is not allowed free tranship ment, they will not have this competition to fear to the same extent and will be less ready to grant it. 17. Bin Saud appears to be under the impression that he has a grievance as regards Bahrain,whereas the local opinion is that we have fostered his interests and those of his merchants rather than those of Bahrain. VJhen,after the war,permits for the export of rice were hard to obtain,we made the ( ( ,usaibis , fortune by granting them permits where others had to go without,and then the RE Export concession was first introduced it was restricted to Kejd and Hasa merchants, thereby giving them a 3^ advantage over the Bahrain merchant desiring to trade with the mainland. 18. Under what obligations are we to Bin Saud that his interests must prevail every time? It seems to me that when it suits him he is allowed to quote ’international practice’ and that when it does not suit him he is allowed to plead ’the requirement of his country’. He is allowed to blockade Kuwait in time of peace and expel Hindu merchants like criminals from his shores because they ventured to comf&gt;e-(i = wmmm fSfgmmi with his merchants,and this time no word is heard of inter national practice. If the Government of India decided to expel Japanese merchants from -dombay because they were found to be doing good business,the Japanese Government would probably consider it an act of war. 19* Again,I have just discovered that while his subjects in Bahrain are all treated on perfect equality with Bahrainis and pay identically the same taxes,he on the other hand levies a higher rate of tax from Bahrain subjects on their date gardens there than that paid by his subjects,the difference being some 18,o. It will be clearly seen that his policy is based entirely on self interest and expediency and that any mention of international practice is a blind. 20* It should be clearly realised that free transhipment on a large scale will still further retard the raising of the Kuwait blockade. The port that is being used as a substitute for Kuwait is Jubail,and if Bin Saud is able to take his supplies there without ai^- payment of dues at all at Bahrain,he will obviously prefer to use that port and will maintain the full rigour of his blockade against Kuwait. Jubail itself is impracticable for steamers and he can only therefore approach it free of charge by means of such a concession at Bahrain. 21. The Bahrain Government have made drastic economies but there is obviously a limit to this,for unlike their neg&amp;h&amp;ours they have a more or less civilised Government to maintain. They have made immense improvements in the last few years,so much so that they are attracting immigrants from all over the Gulf. Their administration cannot,however, he maintained for nothing,and if thwarted in this matter of transhipment dues they will probably recompense themselves by levying drastic port dues,which they would be perfectly entitled to do. I need hardly say that this would be most unwelcome to the British India Steam Navigation Company and M if,as might easily happen,the Persians were to hear W it9* and imitate them the result would be most unfortunate .for than. The Bahrain Government have sunk a great deal of money in the port and appointed a British Customs Director and rort Officer and they are entitled to an adequate return for their outlay apart from any consideration of revenue. 22* The Bahrain Government must,however,be careful to avoid killing the goose which would not be so very difficult, for with adequate buoying and piers Ras Tanurah could be turned into a port that would take a great deal of trade away from Bahrain. Vihether they could persuade steamers to go there or not is another matter,but I believe that it could be done. I do not consider that they are likely to do this as long as the HE Sport duty is maintained as low as 2 /a and I do not think that the withdrawal of the transhipment concession will be sufficient to incite them to develop^ Ras Tanurah. At the present moment,there is little doubt that they could not afford it. 23. I am advising Bhaikh Hamad that he should await a reply from you before denouncing Shaikh Isa’s letter since it was based on the orders of the Governmait of India. I ccnsider: (a). Since the arrangement is based on a letter and not on a treaty or fonnal undertaking he can abrogate it at will,the more particularly since he received no quid pro quo and conditions nave changed. (»)., Bahrain is an independent State and entitled to do what it pleases in territorial waters. The tran shipment traffic must be controlled even if only to prevent smuggling. Since there are often 50 or more ships in harbour this cannot be done without expense. (c). International practice means nothing in these primitive countries,and is only used by Bin Saud as ammunition against us and not as a guide to be followed. Bahrain is sui generis for no^where else that I am aware of do leading merchants of one country live in and transact their country’s trade from anothe 24. I request therefore,that His Majesty King Bin Saud may be informed that the Bahrain Government regret that they are obliged to discontinue the free transhipment concession since it will dislocate the trade of their country. It might be mentioned to him that the old rate of RE duty was 2 ^i but that we secured its reduction to 2$ for him.10 , 25. Finally I request that I may be allowed to inform the -Bahrain Bovemmait that they may put a stop to free transhipment from country craft to country craft forthwith and that they may levy 2 /£ ? duty upon it. Strictly speaking they are still entitled to charge 5r/j on it. This is covered by Colonel Trevor ! s letter and does not form part of Major Dickson 1 s letter to His Mg^esty Sin Saud which only prescribed free transhipment for goods transhipped from steamer to country craft. It would be inequitable to withhold this information from them since it is only due to the fact that we dealing with a shaikh in his dotage that the knowledge was not made use of before.

In thsss circumstances there was no particular reason why shipping using the pert of Bahrain should pay anything more than they would if they used any other sheltered bay in the Persian Oulf| such money wae was received went into haikh Iea*e pocket and he there fore deserved no particular consideration. This state of affairs, howevsr, has now radically changed, fha Bahrain Government have provided wharves, lights, beacons, eto., and it seems only fair that shipping utilising the facilities of the port should contribute towards ite coat, as they do in all civilised ports* At present the Bahrain State levy no port dues. The outer buoys are maintained by the Basrah Conservancy Board, acting on behalf of the Government of India, and for them ships are charged, but some lights hove alee been provided by the Bahrain Government* It would seem only fair therefore that the Bahrain Government should either be allowed to charge 2 per cent customs duty on all goods brought into their port, or should be entitled to charge port dues. As Bhaikh Hamad in his letter points out this agreement was prssumably not intended to bind the state lor ever and as the Government of Ind a pointed out in another connection, it is generally understood that treaties for the denunciation of which no provision is made hold good rebus sic stantibus . In the present case circumstances have radically changed.

If the practice of overside delivery becomes universal for all goods destined fer ^ejd it is calculated that the State will lose 2b per cent of its customs revenu# - a contingency which I should view with the utmost dismay, and which would, I think, involve the State in such serious difficulties that His Ha^esty's Qoverzxaent or the Government of India would be compelled to come to its assistance as they have done in the case of Huscat* 9 # On the other hand, the suggestion that the utate should oimr^e port dues would impose a heavy burden on the shipping interests concerned, the chief of which is the British India Steam navigation Company, who would have to pay so much per ton on all their ships entering the port* I believe that they are at present making very little profit out of their slow mail service, and any additional charge would be very unwelcome* Further, it would proH increase the price of the necessities of life to the inhabitants of Bahrain, many of whan are nowadays on the brink of starvation* I would therefore urge that representations should be made to the Hejas Government on this subject and that the circumstances should be explainedto thorn, particular amph&amp;alo being laid on the faot that oi ce the oonceaoion was nade conditions hare radically changed and that the Bahrain OoTormaent hare sunk considerable suae in the dorelopment 0 Jf their port while at the eaae ti;ao charging no port dueea that it is only fair that shipping utilising the port with its present r&amp;oilltiee should pay something for theoo facilities, and that thero aro two alternativos, either, the abolition of the right of free transhipment, or the levy of port dues, which the Bahrain State are clearly entitled to impose if they see fit* the latter would in the long run probably inrolro higher freight rates froa Bombay which would not be in the interests of the hejaa aorernment or the people of fiejd and that in these circumstances His Majesty’s Oorern- aent trust that the Hejns-Kejd Gorernment will agree to the discontinuance of the privilege of direct transhipment - a privilege ef which actually they have hitherto seldom availed theaeolves.

In continuatia?. of my off ‘wCir.l letter I write you in a friendly v/ay to advise you to obe^ the instructions of the Higfc Government if you wish to avoid their serious disrdeasure. In this friendly letter I ensvrer the points mentioned in your lettor of the BlhZi-Qadeh. Firstly# You state that you had expected that the Government would nave f^iven you a chance to express your views on the cuestion* Ij friend,you forget tint our friend Major Dickson discussed the miter with you at length and took down all your objections oad submitted them to me so far back as last February and I sent them on to Covernnent. I must observe that the Treaty regarding payment of 5 /( ? duty on goods for British subjects in Bahrain anplios to goods d estines for Bah rain and reinaining tiiere and not to'goods in transit lor other places. This argounent is therefore entirely irrelevant. How would merchants in Bahrain liire it if when they order goods from Europe direct the full Indian duty wore charged in Bombay simply because the goods were transhipped there from a London steamer to a Gulf steamer? At the present time thej charge nothing on cargo transhipped in harbour and only 1/oth of the r duty on cargo landed. Ii the High Government lind given you ( instructions to act in the same way aid charge only 1/8 of the * duty,you would have been cnly able to charge 5/8 of one er cent 'instead of ^ which is generally allowed. As regards four excellency’s surgestion that should be allov/ed,! beg leave to point out tliax our friend Mai or Dickson spent one week trying to persuade you to agree to this amicably and I myself sent a message to you su^g’esting that this was the rate in 1913 when the Ruler of rlcjd first turned out the Turks and su^eeting that it should be reverted to.but you refused to listen. Then the matter had to be referred to the High Govern ment and became the subject of an order.and therefore it was fixed at 2^. I would remind Your Excellency that the Ruler of He id intended that no duty at all should be charged tyit only ardhiyah. The I ; igii Covernmont itself only charges 1/3 duty. It is fortunate therefore for Your Excellency that, the order did net say you could only charge 1/8 duty,i.e.,5/8 of 1,** In regard fco the second part of the order as I have said above the High 'Government does not (nor do other Governments) charge any duty at all on direct transhipments,and in this no infringement ot sovereign rights or any others'are involved. Ho State has a right tochargB duty on goods destined for another cxjuntiy which simply corae' to one of its ports by the chances of the routes of shipping,and are not even landed on its shores. I may mention however that this rule is only intended to apply to goods properly manifested for Rosa,Reid or Qatar and brought by steamer. I trustI trust that the above will show lour j •xcellency that the oirder lias not eoen issued without duo consideration and will convince you that no injustice is involved, ohould any I difficulties result from the orders .and iour hccellenqy represent them,they will receive sympathetic consideration from the riigh (Gd). iuP.irevor, Lt Col., Deputy rolitical ueoitent, ersian Gulf.D.0.No:0/ll7.

(a) Arrangement of 1920 was forced on Sheikh in somewhat questionable exercise of suzerainty and without any consideration being received by Bahrain from f Ibn Sand. On political grounds therefore we doubt whether we should be justified in insisting on continuing arrangement against Sheikh's expressed wishes and we are not clear how we can in practice enforce such's decision. «e have recently recommen- -ded grant of fiscal autonomy to Bahrain and now to deny him right to exorcise this limited measure of sovereignty within| his own port would be wholly inconsistent with that recommendation. (b) In taking decision of 1920 Government of India had in view interests of Bahrain itself since they feared that Sheikh Isa*s insistence on excessive transit dues would kill transit trade, whereas smaller charges,.,oharges fcoulu iacreaae tiis inc^uie* situation has now changed and it seeias oiaar that if fre# tranafetpiaant is permitted there is grave danger of Bahrain losing large portion of their income although they have in the meantime invested capital in improving their port. (c). Although inteirnational practice established by xiareelona Convention does not permit duty on goods in transit it allows levy of dues to defray expenses of auminietication and supervision. we oan therefore ■find no justification in international custom for entirely free transhipment within territorial waters whether from steamers ox* dhows. withdrawal by sheikh ot transhipment concession and explt^n position to ’Ibn baud on the lines suggested in paragraph &gt; or Resident's despatch.

BRITISH LEGATION JEDDA, July 5th,1932. t Your Excellency, After Ooqjpliments, In reply to the communication which Your Excellency made to me on June 23 regarding the action taken by the authorities at Bahrain in regard to certain rice shipped to that port by the firm of Haji Abdullah Ali Riza for account of the Hejaz-Nejd Government and intended for distribution to tribes in Hasa, i have the honour to state that the rice in question was shipped under a Bill of Lading marked '•Bahrain in transit for Ojair M and that no notice was given by the steamship company that it was intended for overside delivery. It was therefore dealt with in the same way as ordipary cargo in transit. There would appear to be no foundation for the information telegraphed to your Government to the effect that the rice was landed after having been first unloaded over the ship's side into dhows sent from the mainland to collect it. The Political Agent at Bahrain reports that it was handled in the usual way by the lighters of the landing company. I understand that in the special circumstances of this case the Bahrain Government have consented, as an except- tional measure, to waive the duty payable. Any other question would appear to concern the parties to the commercial trans actions connected with the shipment. With highest respects, sd/-ANDREW RYAN.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No:553 dated the 9th September 193B and to say that I interviewed the Karachi agents *.ho raised t^e matter of their own a cord,and showed me a cop&gt; of tiie Bombay agents letter to &gt;ou. They said that in view of the threatened competition they would be obliged to accent cargo for overside delivery outside harbour limits although they would be most reluctant to do so. It a ,, ears that one Muhammad al i arzu* went to Bombay and interviewed j r.Hadow and threatened to ship by opposition lines or to send cargo by country craft if they refused to grant him overside delivery outside port limits. 2, The Agent showed me a letter from their Bahrain agents reporting the visit of the Fagervich which stated that the otate was contemplating taking ste^.s against shippers who engaged in this traffic and enquired what these steps t.ere. He stated that he understood that the State could not revent overside delivery taking place outside territorial waters. I replied that the State had consiaered the possibility of refusing these foreign steamers permission to come to Bahrain ana also the re atriation of merchants who insisted on conducting their business in this fashion. 3, The Agent said that tiiey fully realised the difficulty they would experience in giving overside delivery outside port limits and that they would not do so unless they were they v-ere forced to do it. He seemed to consider the competition of country craft of littleS'] 2 . of little danger eince they could only proceed there in fair weather and their rates were low owing to unnatural circumstances, I said that the 2% duty which their transhipments now ..aid would discourage them. He a^ eared to doubt that the steps suggested were practicable. I stated tiiat the view in Bahrain was that the interests of the State and the British India steam Navigation Company were identical and that delivery outside port limits would be equally inimical to both,and with this he agreed. 4. It will be seen that the villan in the piece is Muhammad al ^arzuk of Karachi who acts principally for Huha mad al Tawv/il, through Abdul Aziz al Bassam in Bahrain. This man had some 7,500 out of the 30,000 packages the lagervicit brought up and the stc&amp;mer tooit them direct to the Mainland. If the visi/ts of this steamer ot similar ones to Bahrain were stopped,or if they I \ere not allowed to land cargo there larzuk would not be able to find enough cargo to fill a steamer himself and would be obliged ’ to ship by the British India Steam navigation Company,who,if they had not the threat of this line,would not a^ree to give him overside delivery. The State refused to allow the Russians to f send steamers to Bahrain and there is nothing to prevent them from disal owing the visits of any other vessel they found harmful to their interests. 5. In this connection I should mention,that/one of the partners of ihamanmal Ishardas visited me after the ^assage of the lagervick,! asked him why he had allowed the ship to go to the Mainland when it was contrary to Bahrain interests and in the long run,his and those of a.^l the other Indian merchants. He said that they had now realised this but that the s ace had been available on the ship,and;his gents had not considered this when they accented i.arzuk’s cargo. He said that they did not intend to accent such cargo in future.and that if I wished he would not charter these steamers again. I replied that I could not express a wish in what was really a matter of business. It would appear that lhamanmal Ishardas is not lixely to raise any difficulty if these steamers are stopped and no one else nas sufficient3. financial strength to charter a steamer by himself. 6. If the State finds a Kejdi merchant in Bahrain conducting his business in such a way as to cause definite loss of re venue or of trade,there would be nothing to revcnt them re atriating / * Bin Gaud excelled the entire Hindu population of atif without a word of protest from us,and would not be able to rotest against similar action on the art of the Bahrain Govern ment. 7. The State feel very strongly regarding the evasion of their dues by ouerside delivery and will fight it by every means in their power. If we oppose them in what they may conceive to be legitimate steps to protect their interests,we shall be doin* ourselves no good and,in the long run.damaging British Indian interests. The matter is not a simple one,however,and I hope to discuss it with you on iny forthcoming visit.

MOele^ jPolitical Kesldent in the ^Persian Gulf # The Foreign secretary to the Got eminent of India* Simla • Bahrain Transit mies . Sir, ( p,y&gt; 1 have the honour to refer to Government of India telegram Mo. 1644 of the 23rd July 1932 to the India uffice and connected correspondence on the above subject. 2. whether the Bahrain State can abrogate the Transit Dues Agreement eith His Majesty Ibn Baud seems to depend on ehether the so-called agreement was really an N agreeuent 2 * * * * * * * * 11 * * or merely a 'concession 14 • In ordinary law for a contract* or agreement* to be binding there must be a 'consideration M given or received on both sides and it is arguable that the same holds good in international law. The Bahrain btate certainly received no consideration fras Ibn Saud in the matter: on the contrary the State has been the loser. It seems obvious therefore that the arrangement come to was a concession on the part of the State which it can with draw* local circumstances having altered. If this view is correct *ould Jt^not be possible for the conuaunication to His Majesty Ibn Saud to be of a more categorical nature than/than that outlined in paragraph 9 of Sir Hugh Biacoe’e letter Mo. 436-8, dated the 19th June 1938, to the India Office (copy forwarded to India and Jedda under Ho. 437-8), and concurred in hy the Government of India in paragraph 3 of their telegram under reference? If the agreement in question was in reality no “agreement 11 , but merely a con cession, could not Ibn Baud he informed that, owing to changed circumstances, which of course would he carefully explained, the Bahrain State regretted that they could no longer continue it, and that in future 2 per cent, dues will he charged on goods delivered overside? There would thus he no question of ibn Baud's refusal, and — provided that the Bahrain State has a right to levy these dues (which it would seem to have according to the Board of Trade letter Mo. C.K.T.4744/32, dated the 16th august 1932, copy forwarded to the Government of India and Buahlre under India Office printed letter Ho* ^.Z*4991/32, dated 20th August 1932) f-the re will be no question of the State having to impose port dues, the objections against which are detailed in paragraph 9 of sir Hugh Biscoe's letter already quoted* Ibn Baud will doubtless be dis gruntled, but matters have now reached a pass wfcsre it seems to me we have to choose between offending His Majesty, and staving off ruin for Bahrain* The financial condition of the latter is already, without any question of the loss of transit dues, causing me no little anxiety* The State depends for its prosperity almost entirely on the pearl trade, which at present is at a very low ebb: catches of the last few seasons have been poor, and even when pearls are found there is little market for them, nor is the market likely to improve for some years* The State gets by far the greater part of its revenue from ad valorem customs dues, and not only has the bulk of trade decreased, but likewise the price of commodities imported* Last/% Last year’s budget, (the Bahrain financial year runs from May to April) receired since Sir Hugh Biscoe wrote his despateh of 29th June, did not balance, and unless an un expected change for the better oceurs the State will Yery soon be reduced to the dangerous expedient of living on its capital-—a small reserve which it has built up in more prosperous times* If to this critical state of affairs is added the loss of its transit dues the state will be brought an appreciable step nearer to bankruptcy, and His Majesty^ Government or the Government of India may well—as pointed out by Sir Hugh Biscoe in paragraph ti of his letter already quoted—be forced to come to its financial assistance as they have already had to do in the case of muscat. 3* So much with regard to the Ibn baud aspect of the ^ question. As will be seen, however, from the copy of a letter •**»**++*»&lt;* .dated let September 1932 from the British India Steam Mavi- JX. A, gatlon Company, Bombay, which 1 enclose, there has now arisen another and perhaps even more serious complication. On receipt of this letter X telegraphed the ^Political Agent, Bahrain, now on recess in Karachi, to get into touch with the British India Company's Agent there, who would doubtless be au fait with the matter, talk it over with him, and let me have both their views. I enclose a copy of Captain iPrior's reply. 4* The situation is that the British India Company, faced by competitors who threaten to practice overside delivery outside Bahrain waters, state that they will reluctant ly be compelled to adopt the same practice themselves unless I can produce any sound and cogent reasons ^xy they should not do so. The Company do not fear the competition of native craft (vide paragraph 3 of Captain Prior's letter, #ildh aspect is also dealt with in paragraph 6 of sir Hugh Biscoe's depmAtoh of 29th June): it is the competition repre sen ted/aented by such Tease la as S.U. ’•yagerriclc*—mentioned by t Captain Prior—•which is the danger. 5. The 'IPagerriek* 1 , a Norwegian ves^I)^, was, I gather from Captain Priori letter, chartered by the Indian firm of Dhamanm&amp;l Ishardas of Btfirain, and the owner of the cargo which was taken to the mainland is one Muhammad al Uarsuk, mho acts principally for Muhammad al Tawwil, Ibn Saud's Customs Director at Hasa. It will be obserred that one of the partners of Dhamanmal Ishardas and Company has informed Captain Prior that cargo tb the Mainland will not be accepted in future, and if Dhamanmal Ishardas and Company continue this policy, this source of eompetition to the British India Company will at least bs removed. 6* The danger, however, still remains of steamers of th# ’♦FagervicM* class coming to Bahrain and giving overside delivery outside Bahrain waters, (oversidt delivery from such steamers within Bahrain waters can be charged the 2 perjcent. dues.) with reference to this danger Captain Prior suggests the possibility of the State refus ing such foreign steamers permission to come into Bahrain waters, or at any rate to unload cargo there. As there is not enough cargo for the mainland only to fill a steamer, such vessels would be compelled to call at Bahrain to unload the balance of their cargo, and they would not be allowed to do this by the State if they had practised overside delivery outside Bahrain waters. (At least that is how I understand Captain Prior's argument.). It seems to me that such action might be successful in removing the competition of overside delivery outside Bahrain waters, tfiich is the main danger driving the British India Company towards adopting such measures themselves. Captain Prior points out that the State refused Russian vessels permission/..-rtHfe' - b - 10 % permission to call at Bahrain 9 and presumably they have equal right to extend this refusal to other vessels, retaliation in the way of shipping restrictions being, 1 believe, a legitimate weapon in the hands of any govern ment. Such vessels might not always be foreign ones: a steamer belonging to an Indian Company might also be chartered, but—though this might raise protests in Indian circles—I think the Bahrain state would be on strong ground in applying the restriction to Indian vessels also. The restriction, it must be remembered, would not be an absolute one: it would merely be a measure of self-protection* Any vessel that did not practice overside delivery outside Bahrain waters would be welcome at Bahrain* Captain Jfrior^ further suggestion of the possibility of the 'repatriation 11 —a euphemism for expulsion— of merchants who conducted their business on objectionable lines (paragraph 2 of his letter) I cannot fully endorse. Bahraini merchante the Bahrain Government could presumably deal with as they thought expedient, though even they might find it difficult to punish their subjects for practising lawful trade, how ever much this trade might run counter to the financial interests of the fcfctate. But it is more than likely that some of the *offenders* would be cither foreigners or Indians, both of when by the B&amp;rain order in Council come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, who can deport them only for certain specified of fences. In other words, it would be legitimate to take action against the trading, but not against the persons of the traders. 7. With regard to the letter from the British India Company referred to above, I enclose a copy of my reply, which is to the effect that I trust that they may be able to *wait anci &gt;-.ee before taking the steps they contemplate* I understand their anxiety not to lose trade, especially in these/these difficult times for shipping companies, but it is imporl ant that they should be dissuaded-~»if possible—‘from taking any precipitate action, once they commence over side delivery an impetus will be given to this undesirable practice itiiich it may be very difficult to stop. It is equally Beoedfiaryjfor the Bahrain State, and ourselves, to consider the matter of overside delivery outside Bahrain waters carefully before committing ourselves to definite steps for putting an end to this practice, lending, there fore, a consultation with Captain Prior, who arrives here on the 12th October, (1 will also obtain the views of the Financial Adviser, Bahrain,), 1 should like my views ex pressed in paragraph 6 above, on Captain Prior's suggestion as to retaliatory measures, to be considered as tentative. X have, however, given them now so that the matter might come under the consideration of His Majesty's oovemment as soon as possible. On the other hand my views expressed in paragraph 2 as to the nature of the communication to be addressed to His Majesty Ibn Baud, provided that the state has the right to impose the 2 per cent, dues on overside delivery within Bahrain waters without having recourse to port dues, may be taken as considered ones. 8 * T o sum up . The Bahrain state is faced with serious financial difficulties, and if to these is added the loss of its transit dues, in order to stave off the bankruptcy of the state, His Maje sty's government of the Indian Government may sooner or later have to step in and assist the State as they did in the case of Muscat. By a concession which the State, wone twelve years ago, under considerable pressure from us, gave His Majesty Ibn Baud, it is now threatened with the loss of these dues. 1 am of opinion that His Majesty should be informed that, owing to changed circumstances, the State is now regretfully com pelled/eoaptlltd to cancel thin concession. A further ccnplica- tion, however 9 has nos arisen. Ihe hritinti India Company, forced by competitors tfio threaten overside delivery out side Bahrain waters, state that they will reluctantly be compelled to adopt the same practice themselves unless strong reaeone can be produced why they sliould not do so. Certain action to deal with the threatened competition has been suggested by the ttolltieal Agent, Bahrain. In as far as his proposals are directed against the laethoaa of trade, end not against the persons or the traders, these t proposals have my tentative concurrence, irlth regard to the letter from the British India Compmiy, 1 have sent them a reply which 1 trust will have the effect of prevent ing them from taking precipitate action until 1 have had an opportunity to consult further the itolitlcal Agent, Bahrain, who is visiting Buahlre uhortly, and until His I&amp;ajesty's Government have had time to give the matter their conaideration. X am sending copies of this despatch to nia Majesty's secretary of Btate for India end his majesty's Minister at Jedda. 1 have the honour to be, sir, four most obedient servant.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No:687-S dated the 20th September 1932 to the Government of India regarding Bahrain transit dues. 2. I pointed out %o the late Sir Hugh Biscoe in my j^.O. No:C/117 dated the 10th July 1932 that the Hedjaz-Nejd Government had accepted the situation and this view has since been confirmed by a private letter I have just received from the Adviser. According to this they are making a further very large shipment of rice and sugar and are paying the 2% transit dues without question,Muhammad al Tawwil having been ordered to arrange this with Shaikh Hamad and the Bahrain Government. It is clear,therefore, that the communication to His majesty King Bin Baud might very well be of a more categorical nature. 3. As regards the view expressed in the conclusion of paragraph 6 of the above mentioned letter,! venture to suggest that/the Government of India made no protest at the expulsion of the Hindu community from qatif it would be difficult to explain to the Bahrain otate why persons conducting operations ruinous to their trade should be allowed to take shelter at Bahrain. Bvery State is at liberty to withdraw permission to reside from foreign nationals with or without assigning a reason,and I believe since a case\ a case of this nature has recently been brought to your notice at Bushire.

Since your letter I tnink the matter has changed, for the worse, tuen it was only a matter of the direct transhipment at sea, now the B.I. themselves are threatening to send steamers to the mainland. be compelled not to 0 ive nave felt forced to ao merchant of Karachi, who the B.I. that he is his cargo between India If small steamers and native cre.ft could direct transhipment at sea the B.I. would not so. Now Russell tells me that Mazook the Arab is the B.I.'s biggest shipper, is threatening going to arrange for a small steamer to carry and Has Tanoura or other mainland ports direct. The B.I. who are actua losing money on the Gulf run at present are so alarmed at this threat that they are prepared to send a boat there t. emselves. Mazook tells them that great numbers of native craft are plying between India, Karachi, and Bahrain and the mainland ports, cutting away their trade, he also tells ti.em that most of the cargo he sixips to Bahrain eventually goes to the mainland. I tuink much of tiiis argument is bluff. Possibly a great many native craft sail from Karachi with cargo said to be for Bahrain,or for the mainland, but a very few of them actually arrive at their alleged destination. Tney creep up tne coast to Persia or to the ports near tne frontier. In Karachi native era!ts declaring ior mainland ports are not from the ports to wnich their 1 think the wnole matter Mazook uses to force the B.I. at tixis end now much of his required to produce landing certificates cargo is declared; if this could be done might be affected and the argument wh oh would not hold water. 1 am f inding out imports really go to the mainland. The Bahrain Government will, now, gladly allow uireot overside delivery within the pnrt provided that the Zf, duty is paid. I think tins fact is not sufficently known to tne shippers in Bombay and Karachi. We should lose pier fees etc etc but in comparison to the 2/6 this is not of importance. It is generally believed that a great deal af the cargo wnich is sent to the mainland is smuggled across to Persia, I am told tiiat now it is even worth smuggling rice across, not only tea and sugar.

Sir, X hare the honour to say that on my departure from Karachi for Bushire, Mohammed Marzuk, a Karachi merchant principally interested in the overside delivery, came to me on the steamer and said that he was pressing Messrs. Mackxinon Mackenzie &amp; Co. for a reply regarding the matter. 2. He asked me if a way out could not be found and aaid that he would agree to pay a net 2 per cent duty, provide ed he was allowed direct transhipment and not obliged to land cargo, and if this was arranged he would drop the question of chartering a special stemmer - a threat he had held out to the British India Steam navigation Company if he was not given overside delivery outside Bahrain territorial waters. 3. In the course of the discussion he said that he would undertake to send full consignments of not less than 3000 bags at a time of both rice and sugar and he assured me that Messrs. Maekinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. would accept gladly despite the loss of landing charges. This, I believe, is a fact . a .- 2 - (\V^ fact. Failing this he threatened to ship direct to Ojair, avoiding Bahrain altogether, by a small 500 ton steamer, and showed me a telegram f r jm a certain firm offering him space. 4 # x told him that I would represent this to the Bahrain Government, and that I hoped that some solution could be found on these lines, and upon the steamer leaYxng I immediately telegraphed the gist of the above to the adviser, pointing out certain drawbacks, one of which is a possible diversion of the sugar trade which, however, could be counter ed by limiting the concession to normal Hejdi requirements. I also pointed out to him that other merchants might also apply for the same facility, nevertheless I recomaended this solution to him and asked him for the views of the Bahrain Government. He has replied to me that the State considered this the best solution from the present impasse , but that they wished ttet the minimum consignment to be 4000 bags, and added that the concession could only apply to genuine Nejdi cargo and that it must be marked 'R.B.'. 5. I suggest therefore that Messrs.Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. may be asked to inform Mohammed Marzuk that the State will allow him direct transhipment in Bahrain waters provided (l) that he pays a net 2 per cent duty, (2) that his consign ments are not less than 4000 bags of rice or sugar and (3) that the consignments are genuine Hejdi cargo, Messrs .Hack frnan Mackenzie &amp; Co. I feel sure will be delighted at this solution as it removes the threat of opposition steamers and although they will lose in landing charges ( the landing Company at Bahrain being a subsidiary of the British India Steam Naviga tion Company) wtii still this loss will be far less than what they would lose if rival steamers were to be introduced on seeI hare the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient serrant, f &lt; ( ) 4 ' Capt*, Political Agent, Bahrain.The Secretary to the HoiTble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Political Agent, Bahrain, and is directed to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documents.

I saw the Financial Adviser to-day and ascertained from him that the dues at Bahrein are, in fact, substantially below the amount required to defray the expense of supervision and administration. But in any case, if we rightly understood our discussion with you the other day, the view of the Board of Trade is that nothing that occurs in connection with cargo at Bahrein, whether it be transhipment overside or landing and reshipment at the wharf, falls properly within the definition of transit. The point is not of much importance in the circumstances, but I should be glad if you would confirm the correctness of my assumption. Meanwhile, we are writing officially to the Colonial Office supporting the proposals of the Political Resident and the Government of Inuia on the general question. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel and Williams. Yours, etc. (Sd.) J.G. LAITHWAITE. T.G. Jenkins, Esq., M.C., Board of Trade, Great George Street, S.W. 1.CQPYSENT TQ BOARD OP TRADii, C.R.T.4744/32. GREAT GEORGE STREET, 3.W. 1. 26th August 1932. Dear La1thwaite, Many thanks for your letter of yesterday (P.Z.5133/32) about the so-called transit duties at Bahrein. When I spoke to you earlier about the matter I did say that it was doubtful whether the Transit Convention really applied to these dues, and on that there were two points (1) whether the goods were in transit within the meaning of the Convention, and (2) whether, if so, the aues themselves could he considered to he transit dues. The first point may he open to aoubt, hut in view of the fact that it is usually in our interest to interpret the Transit Convention as widely as possible we should not wish to contest the Foreign Office view, which apparently is that goods transhipped at Bahrein are in transit within the meaning of the Convention. The real point is the second one, that is whether these dues are 'special aues in respect of transit' within the meaning of the opening words of Article III of the Statute annexed to the Convention. On this point we feel quite confident that the answer is in the negative. The Transit Convention is intended to secure that a country shall not place impediments in the way of goods which have to cross its territories in getting from one country to another. The dues which are allowed to he levied are those 'intended solely to defray expenses of supervision and administration entailed by such transit.' This, as you will see, makes no mention of such expenses as the upkeep of ports. It was intended to deal solely with/ J.G. Laithwaite, Esq.r n \l% with theprovision of services for the purpose of securing that goods, which had paid no customs duties because they were in transit, actually left the country at the other end of the journey and did not remain within the country itself* Clearly, therefore, it was contemplated that dues necessary for the upkeep of ports and similar expenses would be charged in addition. As we understand the matter, this transhipment charged is intended to defray the expenses of the port. No country can claim that its goods shall have the use of a port in another country and shall make no contribution to the expenses of that port, and it seems to us therefore that no country can claim that goods which have to be imported through Bahrein should escape all charges in Bahrein. For the reasons which you explained it would be inequitable and unsatisfactory to charge port aues on the tonnage of the vessels carrying the goods, as is done in most other countries. The alternative is to charge dues upon the goods themselves, and it seems to us that dues so charged, so long as they are reasonable in amount and bear some relation to the cost of upkeep of the port, are port dues in fact whatever they may be in name and fall entirely outside the scope of the Transit Convention. Perhaps some difficulty might be avoided if you made sure that the dues shall be called by some name which did not suggest that they were in fact transit dues. I am sending copies of this letter to Hendel and Williams. Yours, etc. .(3d.) t.g.

I understood, when I raised this point with you the other day,/day, that it would, in the opinion of the India Office, be met by instructing the Political lesident not to permit the Bheikh to raise this transit due above two per cent, and that you were confident that the condition which ie being made in agreeing temporarily to grant the Sheikh tariff autonomy - vis* that he must give the folitical Heeident four months* notice of any proposed change in his tariff - will place the Political Resident in s position to carry out such instructions* e should be glad to have confir mation of this and to know that you are prepared to instruct Fowls accordingly* On hearing from you that you agree, we will instr?ict Hope Gill to make a written comsiunloatioa to the Saudi Government on the lines proposed above* I am sending copies of this letter to Blaster and to Jenkins* Yours ever.* Office of the Political A^env, Bahrain^ Camp, Buehire. Dated the 29th October 1932. Proa To The Political A, ent, Bahrain, at Buahire. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, Bashire. A Sir, I hare the honour to refer to the correspondence enclosed with Bushire Residency endorsement lio.809-S, dated the 26th October 1932, regarding Baiirain Transit dues* 2* Since considerable attention has been devoted to the possible ^international' difficulty that may arise under the Barcelona Convention, I take this opportunity to point out that since the State is not a party to this Convention and has not even heard of it, it has no bearing whatsoever upon Bahrain and its affairs. I may perhaps be permitted to record here my surprise that whereas xbn Saud is allowed a perfectly free hand to do sdiatever he thinks best in the interests of his State, the moment the Government of Bahrain show a desire to assert themselves their way is barred by a formidable barrier of international conventions. 1 have mentioned eleewhere that when Shaikh Isa was informed in 1920 that his transit duty was illegal according to international practice ( now curiously enough found to be legal after all ) he pathetically observed that ' he was sure that there was something in his favour in international practice if only he knew of it'.3. I notice from a statement in this letter that the Foreign Office are prepared to acquiesce in the shaikh's with drawal of this concession. /re they aware that the Bahrain Cioveminent have already withdrawn it and consider the matter settled ? It is therefore quite inappropriate to attempt to secure Ibn Baud's concurrence to its withdrawal and he must be notified of a fait accompli . Since he has apparently already accepted the situation a detailed explanation appears out of place* As regards the imposition of Port dues. A have come to the considered opinion that this is quite impracticable and will if necessary give detailed reasons which will, I think, prove unanswerable. 4 , Finally I notice the view expressed that the withdrawal of the concession will confirm the remainder of the 1920 arrange ment. This is quite untenable. What has happened is that the State is now being granted customs autonomy and that this is to be exercised subject to a four months' notice to the Political Resident. This in no way prejudices their existing treaty right to charge up to 5 per cent on all classes of merchandise, and they can charge any transit duty they please provided they do not exceed thf&gt;t figure. Actually, they would be ill advised to exceed the 2 per cent duty now levied arid have no intention of doing so. Circumstances may change, however, and the State must be left full scope to protect its interests in whatever method the situation of the period dictates. 5 . I presume I am in order in referring to demi-official letters, since this appears to be the only form the correspondence has taken. X have the hon ur to be.

Since he has apparently already accepted the situation a detailed explanation appears out of place. As regards the imposition of Port dues# 1 have come to the considered opinion that this is quite impracticable and will if necessary give detailed reasons which will* I think # prove unanswerable# 4, Finally I notice the view expressed that the withdrawal of the concession will confirm the remainder of the 1920 arrange ment. This is quite untenable. &lt;hat has m** happened is that the State is now bein b granted customs autonomy and that this is to be exercised subject to a four months' notice to the political Resident# This in no way prejudices their existing t eaty right to charge up to 5 per cent on all classes of merchandise, and they can charge any transit duty they please provided they do not exceed th&amp;t figure. Actually, they would be ill advised to exceed the 2 per cent duty now levied and have no intention of doing so# Circumstances may change, however, and the State must be left full scope to protect its interests in whatever method the iituation of the period dictates# 5 # I presume I am in order in referring to demi-official letters since this appears to be the only form the correspondence has taken# i have the hon ur to be.

Your letter of September 13th,C/l58,para2. Bahrain Bovemnent should not without p^io^ reference to me issue notice refusing steamers who carry cargo to mainland permission to discharge cargo at Bahrain.No. of 1351 Office of the Adviser to the G-overnment, Bahrain. Dated, 2nd, Rajab. 1351 3lst Octr. 1932. From The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. To H. B. M’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to acquaint you with the facts leading up to and connected with the stay of s.s. 'Ahmedi”, belonging to the Eastern Navi gation Company, in Bahrain. I understand that« the Company and the consignees are making an official complaint to you alleging that the ship was delayed in the Port by the Government of Bahrain. Owing mainly to outside conditions over which the State has no control the financial position of this State is now very grave. Recently however the trade and the revenue of Bahrain has been threatened by a new and very serious danger, which if not prevented will reduce the revenue by perhaps one third. Certain foreigners, Hindus, Persians and Najdis, who have for many years enjoyed the freedom and security of Bahrain and have grown rich from trading- 2 - trading in Bahrain, have recently combined together to charter small steamships from India which they bring into the harbour of Bahrain. These steamers carry cargo for Bahrain and for the mainland port of Ojair. Until now Bahrain has been the entrepot of the mainland and all cargo for the mainland entering Bahrain pays 2^ Customs duty, whether transhipped directly, within the port, or landed and re-exported. Some two months ago a small steamer, s.s. TT Fagervick w of the National Steamship Company came to Bahrain where she discharged cargo and then carried the remainder of her cargo to Ojair. She was chartered by Messrs. Dhamanmal Isardas, a Hindu firm, resident and trading in Bahrain. Owing to various circumstances the Govt, did not on this occasion take any action, but the danger of further incidents of this kind was fully appreciated. The Government also learnt that if small steamships continued to run direct from India to the mainland, calling at Bahrain en-route where they lighten themselves by discharging cargo to enable them more easily to navigate the course to Ojair, there might be a possibility of the British India Steam Navigation Company sending their ships direct to the mainland ports. This would entirely destroy Bahrain’s position as the entrepot of the mainland. The Government is aware that it cannot prevent or control ships which are going direct from India to mainland ports but it intends to discourage this practice ©very possible means in the case of steamers which✓ which first call at Bahrain on their way to the mainland, or which visit Bahrain after discharging \ cargo at mainland ports. The State strongly resents the action of these foreign merchants who in this way are attempting to evade the payment of the 2% duty and as an indication of its disapproval, such steamers, unless they pay the duty,, will be afforded no facilities whatever and will not be allowed to land cargo in Bahrain. After lengthy discussions with his brothers, his \ '] eldest son and myself, on the subjects I have mentioned above, H. E. Shaikh Hamad decided on 20th October to publish a proclamation (No. 28 of 1351) forbidding any one to become Agent of an Air or Shipping company, with out the permission of the Government, also forbidding persons to load or unload cargo or passengers in Bahrain waters without permission. The proclamation was issued on 24th October. According to a bazaar rumour s.S. 'Ahmedi' was proceeding to Bahrain with cargo for Bahrain and the mainland. Various merchants in Bahrain were approached by the Eastern Steam Navigation Company and invited to accept the Agency including Messrs. Dhamanmal Isardas, Yousuf bin Ahmed Kanoo, Mustafah bin Abdul-Latif, but they all refused. Finally Messrs. Mohomed Abdul-Aziz Al-Ajaji &amp; Bros, applied to the Government for permission to accept the Agency. Permission was refused. On 27th October s.s. 'Ahmedi' arrived. About one third of her cargo was for Bahrain and about two thirds for Ojair, the Bahrain consignees were Messrs. Kishendas Haridas and Messrs. Mustafah bin Abdul-Latif, the first a Hindu, the second a Persian firm; the Ojair cargo-4- cargo according to the manifest was in the name of Abdul Aziz AM al-Bassam, a Najdi merchant. All three live and trade in Bahrain. In accordance with the decision arrived at, the Director of Customs was instructed to inform the Captain of the ship that 2% duty should be paid on the Ojair cargo failing which no cargo would be allowed to be discharged in Bahrain. The captain refused to pay but suggested paying a corresponding amount to be called 'bottom duty' but this suggestion was not accepted. He landed and called on me, and then lodged a complaint at the Agency. He then called on the consignees. On 28th a report on the cargo was prepared by the Director of Customs from which it appeared that the 2^ duty on the Ojair cargo was approximately Rs 2,112/-. On the same day, the Captain wrote a letter protesting against Government’s prohibition to land Bahrain cargo, and applying to act as his own Agent. On 29th, 1 had several interviews with the Captain and wrote to him suggesting that the amount of duty claimed should be provisionally lodged in Eastern Bank, in the name of h. B. M f s Political Agent, who would deal with the matter on his return. A copy of the letter was sent to the Ojair consignee, Abdul Aziz Ali Al-Bassam with a covering letter asking him to acquaint the Government if the money was lodged on which the Bahrain cargo could be discharged. Abdul Aziz Ali al-Bassam replied that the cargo for Ojair was not his but belonged to the shippers.He was informed that it was immaterial by whom the money was lodged and as soon as it was deposited the Bahrain cargo could be landed. He replied that he would wire to the owner of the cargo and inform Government on receipt of reply. me On 30th the Captain informed/by letter that he had orders to proceed to Ojair with all the cargo. He enquired whether the Bahrain Government objected to his leaving and was informed that neither now nor at any time did the Bahrain Government object to his leaving the Port. In the same letter he stated that the Representative of Ojair' had arrived and was prepared to pay the deposit in the name of King Ibn Saoud. On 30th, Shaikh Mohomed alVTawil arrived from Hassa and, I understand, made a personal protest to H. E. Shaikh Hamad at the boat being held up. Today I have heard that the boat is proceeding to Has Tanura where she will discharge her Ojair cargo.

Sir, I have the honour to fo»-wa&gt;-d for your information a copy of a letter I have received from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government regarding the S.S ' imadi'. This vessel unloaded her cargo at Has Tanurah and is now believed to have proceeded to Ojair,possibly to load dates. I understand that tiie cargo originally destined for Bahrain has either been disposed of on the Mainland or is being brought back in dhows to Bahrain. 2. The Ship left Bahrain before I arrived and I cannot, therefore,give any account of -hat occurred,but the facts are clearly set out in the Adviser^s letter. I was surprised that the State did not accept the Captain’s offer to pay the duty but apparently he got no further than ranking the offer and subsequently withdrew it. At no time did the State place any obstacle in the way of the steamer leaving Bahrain,their attitude simply being that no cargo might be landed here. 3. I was surprised to find on arrival,the intensity oi the feeling the visit of this Ship has aroused and the action of the Shaikh’s Government has been warmly applauded by all the leading merchants who clearly saw in the opening ot such a ±x traffic the ruin of thei^ country. His Excellency Shaikh i amad is satisfied with the action taken for the present but will no doubt consider other means if this action should be lound to be insufficient for its purpose. 4. At the instance of the Bahrain Government a telegram hasbeen sent to Messrs Lackinnnn Mackenzie &amp; Company through the local Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company to discover whether Muhammad al Larzuk has accepted the te^ms offered him by the State,which were outlined in your letter No:776-5 of the 14th October 1S32. A reply is still awaited and I am,therefore,unable to say exactly what the situation is regarding this proposal. I understood from Shaixh ; uhammad that this man was recently charged before a BritiA Indian Court with smuggling silver dollars into India in boxes of dates. This fact,if tme,is of interest. 5. In preventing the visits of steamers who will inevitably destroy the Bahrain entrepot trade,the Bahrain Government are protecting not only their own interests,but also British interests and those of the British India Steam Navigation Company. It is to our interests that trade should be concen trated in these islands and any diversion of it to Ojair or Ras Tanurah,where we have no representative and Hindus cannot trade,would be a blow to our position. ^ As has been point out elsewhere if the State’s finances collapse,we shall be expected to come to the rescue. The British India Jteam Navigation Company are at present in a weak position since their mail contract obliged them to adhere to a sche ule,and visit a number of ports (Jask,Gharbar,kenjam,Ling6h) which a^e a deao. loss to them. If lay means of &gt;-ival steamers of small tonnage the Nejd Government could fo^ce them to visit las Tanurah not only would a deadly blow be struck at Bahrain,but the Company would be obliged to spend at least one or more days at an additional port and so have great diificulty in maintain ing the present service which only gives steamers five days in harbour at the terminal port, Bomb ay 6. In regard to the instructions contained in your telegram No:713 of the 1st November 1932,1 venture to point out that the State has already issued its proclamation and that it would be impossible for than to withdraw it now and any such suggest-] suggestion would 'be very ill received. It is unfortunate that the State did not give longer notice of its intentions but they a^*e well within thei^ rights and legally theiv position is unassailable. On the lersian coast customs officials constantly strike whole shipments from ships mani fests and refuse pemission fo”** their landing on the grounds that some monopoly law is inf ringed, with the result that the steamer is obliged to ca^y them all the way back to the port of origin. Adequate notice is seldom,if ever^given of these enactments and protest is invariably ineffective. ou a^e probably aware that bills of lading contain clauses which protect Shipping Companies from tthe acts of Princes and Rulers 11 . I understand that no vessel similar to the Ahmadi is on its way to Bahrain and a similar incident will not arise again as all shippers are well informed of the Bahrain govern ments embargo,and will ma&amp;e their arrangements accordingly.

'1 uhammad Llarssuk, the Karachi shipper principally' interested in the cuestion of overside delivery interviewed Captain prior f the Political Agent ^Bahrain (who has just'*been on a visit to mo here/ at Karachi on 9th October; After, discussion he stated that if he'were allowed overside delivery he would pay a net 2 per cent transhipment charge,would under take to ship consignments of not less than 3000 bags at a' time and would refrain from chartering special vessels for carrying cargo direct from the mainland. 3. On consultation the Bahrain Government -have intLotted that thqy 'consider this the best solution out of the present impas se prrovided that the concession is limited to genuine hejdf cargo,iiuirked 'H.B.'’ and shipped in oonsi^paments of not less than 4000 bags at a time. 4. It seems to me that this is the most satisfactory solution of the &lt;pjestion that can be arrivedrat in the interests of all parties concerned. The Bahrain Government, while losing'a certain amount of revenue 'in the way of pier charges, etc, re tain their main source of revenue from such cargo,i.e.,the 2 per cent transhipment duty; the British India Steam ‘Navigation Company,while losing some income from landing charges,(in which I understand they are interested), rc f tain,without'ioar of competition,their iiain source of' profitvthe carrying t&gt;*ade;‘Lind the* shippers obtain their chief requiroment,overside delivery. 5 .'I would'su t x;est tlierefore tliat Luharamad Marzuk ( and any othe^ shippers who offer cargo for overside delivery rmay be informed ty you of the conditions on which the # Bahrain ' Government are prepared to grant the concession within Bahrain waters. If the minimum of 4000 bags required by the 'Bahrain Government is likely to prove unacc opt able' to snippers I daresay that the Bahrain Government might ’•educe the minimum to 3000 bags.

We have the honour to refer to your letters Nos* 702-S ana 776-S of 20th September and 14th October last reepectively acknowledged in our letter of 26th ultimo* In the first of your above mentioned letter-syou stated your understanding, of the position to be that this Company dia not fear country craft competition* This hardly represents the pre sent state of affairs and while the following remarks may be un necessary in view of your later advices we set them out lor your information. The competition which is being experienced irom country craft between all ports of call on this Company’s Persian Gull Services is most serious* These craits manned by a few men are under no obligation to conform to Government rules, their upkeep is practically negligible, and they pay little in the way of dues at ports of call* In these days when they can iind no lucrative employment in fishing, etc., the crews are willing to accept cargoes at rates which grant them a bare living anu are naturally exploited by shippers* Against this compe tition the British India Company has to reduce rates of freight to, in many cases, a level below economic working point* In the case of certain commodities the Company are unable to compete at all* These boats also land cargoes at points where the Company cannot do so, for various reasons, and are an ever increasing menace* It will therefore be seen that country craft opposition caniiOt be lightly dismissed and is as serious as the oppositionof the smaller Steamship Companies, and if we are faced with the grant by the latter of delivery of mainland cargo either direct at mainland ports or outside Bahrein Territoxial water limits you will realise how serious the Company’s position becomes* There is no doubt that this matter has arisen through the increasing charges levied on cargo by the Bahrein Govern ment* These charges have reached such a level that they have driven cargoes along cheaper avenues. We in Bombay are faced with the same problem* In Bombay there are all facilities for handling cargo, good docks, etc. These facilities have to be paid for but, with the fall in values, cargoes have been directed to ports e*g., in Kathiawar, where, while few faci lities exist, charges are negligible* You also informed us that the Bahrein State may be able to take certain retaliatory measures against those of our competitors shipping direct to the mainland or , ranti% over side delivery outside Bahrein Territorial waters. We must say that we are doubtful to what extent retaliatory measures such as those indicated will assist this Company. The number of smaller Steamship Lines today is such that the exclusion of one from any trading benefits will bring forward another. The principal shippers interested in the Nejd trade are Messrs El mar zook and S.A.Bassam and if they are determined to ship to the mainland direct they will find means of doing so. To our mind the better method of retaining the traffic for carriage via Bahrein is to win over these shippers. Here we would refer to your letter of 14th ultimo in which you set forth the conditions under which th Bahrein Government are prepared to grant overside delivery of cargo intended for mainland ports* We repeat these conditions in abstract: - Consignments must be genuine Nejdi cargo. Consignments must consist of not less than 4000 bags.■ 'ii^ipt ■ • -3 - Coneignaienta muet be markeb Shippers agreeing to effect shipments unoer these terms will be charged 2$ transhipment dues on the value oi cargo and must refrain from, (a) chartering special vessels for carrying cargo direct to the mainland and (b) taking delivery of cargo overside outside Bahrein Territorial waters. i There is one of the conditions above to which we wisii to draw your attention viz;,. M Shippert agreeing to effect shipments under theee terms must refrain from chartering special vessels.^ We take it that, in framing this condition, the Bahrein Government had in mind not only such veesels as the p &gt;i jJ- — ' 'Ahmed i 'I 1 * ’’tfagervik' but also/include country crait. We shall, however, be obliged if you will advise us the exact meaning to be applied to the word 'special vessels'. You will realise from our previous remarks that country craft competition is a serious matter to this Company and, if shippers interested could be persuaded to coniine their cargo to this Company’s vessels, it would be greatly to the advantage of the Bahrein Government as well as to the Com any. For some time the Bahrein Government have permitted direct transhipment from one country boat to another in Terri torial waters at a transhipment charge of 2# on the value oi the goods transferred. It seems to us that some inducement should be offered shippers by regular Steamship Companies to confine their shipments by these Companies, especially as the condi tions set out above demand minimum shipments of 4,000 bags. Such a stipulation is not made in the case of country crait ana we therefore suggest that the Bahrein Government might consider a charge of ad valorem only on shipments by regular oteam- ship Lines against 2$ in the case oi country cxaft. We feel sure you will realise that it is essential to keep the transhipment charge as low as possible in an endeavourto poreuoiiC Xa car^u^Jfa tot tlie gain land to ah Ip all their oor^o via Bahrein. woula odviae that we nave gaae ao eu^cetiun on the atove Unce to ahiypere but are aclns uur utraoat to x&gt;er f ur.ce thaa to acocpt tji© terga ue iaiu iUOAti auovo.

Captain Prior, however, pointed out to m we that the ainaigneert* or their agente, of the cargo consigned to ujtttr lived at Bahrain. b. The matter was urgent, there was no tix*« to enter into lengthy argmsents. especially by telegraw, into the merits of the State’s decision, and the main object for the moment wao to enable the -Ahnedi* to discharge her cargo for Bahrain with the leaut possible delay, and continue lier voyage.

' I Sir, Your obedient Servtait,, (Sd.) G. W. MENDEL,No. 0-44 of 1932. Office of the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, Gamp, Bahrain, dated 10th December 1932. 1 Ml Subject : Bahrain transit t^ade. Si” (\&lt;\ I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with my despatch No. 383-3, of 30th November 1932, tojthe Government of India on the above subject. 2. You will remembe^ that we discussed this matter with Lr. Belgrave, the Pinancial advise'' to the Bala rain State, during my present visit to Bahrain. By far the greater part of the revenue of the State is derived f^om customs dues, and of these dues a considerable fraction is represented by transit dues taken on goods destined for the mainland, i.e. Saudi Arabia. The question of the concession in the matte'' of transit dues given to His Najesty Non Sand by the late Shaikh lisa was dealt with in my despatch No. 687-S, of 20th Sept- '-embe^ 1932, to the Government of India, and this aspect has been solved by the decision of N. Li’s. Government to inform Non Saud that the concession is definitely at an end ( vide Foreign Office letter No. E.4829/316/25 of 12th October 1932, to the India Office, copy sent to you under this office P.L. No. 809-3 of 26th October 1932.. Transit dues, therefore, on goods delivered overside from steamers in Bahrain waters will have to be paid. (Over- -side delivery from dhov/ to dhow was neve 1 ' covered by the concession) The Political Agent, Bahrain.2 l/$ f n ^ i 1 concession;. This decision hns not been communicated No. 631 to Ihn Saud fo'' the reasons given in my telegram^of 6th October 1S32 to the G-ove^nment of India, with which tne Government of India and H.Li’s. Government concurred (vide Government of India telegram No. 2267, of 10un ^ctoDer 1932, and foreign Office letter 0 f 4th November 193^ oo India Office). If, however, the Saudi ^raoian Govern- -ment raise the question this decision will p esumablj oe communicated to them. 3. Another threat has, however, arisen to Jahmn's . / transit trade, which takes various lO^ms. (a) car^y 11 Small, speoially chartered, steame-s may &gt; cargo both lor Bahrain and the mainland, unload the former at Bahrain, and take the lattei o&amp;g 0 Arabia, thus evading the transit dues ( ^dimedi case my desnatch to G-ovemment of India Lo. ooo-, nf November 1932. and f, i*‘agervick ,T case, my despatch.No. 68V-3 of Soth September 1932 to government of India). w (c) (d) Or such steamers ma^ outside 3ahrain^waters and ive overside delive hus force the Nyiti outside Janrain wafers auu. ^ India Steam Navigation Oqmpanv to follow suio ^para- -gfaph 3 of my despatch i.o. oo/-^j.

Ne ’.vei*e of opinion, and It. Belgrave agreed, tliat wttks — while as an isolated instance - the action of the State in rega'-d to the 'Ahmedi 1 ' could be justified, (Lohammed Larzuk, fo' instance, the principal shipper of the mainland cargo in the '.ihmedi , deliberately broke the agreement with Captain Prior mentioned in my despatch to the Government of India, No. 7 7Qk3 of 14th October 1932), this action could not be adopted as a general policy. If, therefore, another vessel in similar circumstances wishes to land cargo at ^ahrain at some time in the future, it will have to be allowed to do so. 146 (2° Jl —— This— -— ——This mil not involve much 'loss of face' 1 on the part of the State, as the notice it has issued in this connection, see paragraph 7 of financial Adviser T s letter to Captain Prior, ho. 676/3 of 31st-October 1932, merely reiterates the general and theoretical right, which presumably every G-ov- -emment possesses, of controlling the unloading of cargo in its own waters. 5. Vfith regard to (b), (c) and (d) we we&gt;~e agreed that prima facie it was difficult to see what political o~ admin- -istrative action the State could take, and hr. Belgrave was inclined to concur in this opinion. The only line for the State to pursue would seem to be, somehow or other, to make it wo^th while for the traders concerned to use Bahrain as a transit port. There are some suggest- -ions to this effect in the ritish India Steam Navigat- -ion T Company T s letter to me of 7th Ilovembe^. I would be grateful if you would discuss the matter with Lr. Belgrave and let me have your views in dug course.

I. 2 The Legsl Adviser, to th** Government of Bahrein BAHREIN bir e have the honour to refer to the call of our s.s 'AHL-hDI' at the port of Bahrein on the 27th of October 1932 and the correspondence exchanged between the Master of the ship and yourself and particularly the liaster f a letter to you dated at Bahrein the 30th October 1932. lawful general merchandise in Bombay and Karachi for Bahrein and Ojair and proceeded to Bahrein for discharging the cargo of the port of Bahrein and with the intent to proceed thereafter to Ojair for discharging the cargo of that port. «.ost unfortunately for us and for reasons which we are not aware, the Government of Bahrein issued their Proclamation No.28/1301 dated 24th Jamadal Thany 1301 ( corresponding to 24th October 19o2, when the *AHi .IDI” was on her way to Bahrein, prohibiting persons in Bahrein from actin 0 as Agents to steamers and airships without the previous permission of the Government of Bahrein, and in consequence thereof Mr. Yusoof Bin ’hm^d K'-noo who was our Agent for many years refused the Agency of the 'AH DT* and Mr. Mustaffa Bin 'bdul Ir'tiff whom we desired to act as our gent would not do so, and ^essrs Mohamed Abdul Aziz Alajaji &amp; Bros, who actually accep ted our gency ware not permitted to work as our :gents. The date s you are no doubt aware, the s.s.'ARKADI* loaded2 .TERN S. N. CO., LTD. BOMBAY, dviser . to the Government, of Bahrein. Bp.hr o in. of the abovementioned Proclamation and the free working allowed t a 'CliY line steamer while 'ARLKuI** wa&amp; there clearly show that the Proclamation was only intended to apply to our ship. The s.s.'AHmj!' arrived at Bahrein on the 27th October 1932 and owing to the above circumstances there was no gent to attend to her, and the Paster of the ship actin,/ on his own behalf made the entry of the ship inwards by depositing the cargo manifests at the Bahrein Custom House, applied to the Director of Customs and Poit Officer, Bahrein, by his letter dated 28th Jam&amp;d 1351 for permission to act as his own Agent for the ship; r-nd from your letter dateu 29/10/1932 addressed to the Manager, Bahrein Landing Company, it would seem that permission to act as the ship’s -gent was given to the i aster and the matter of the landing of Bahrein cargo depended upon completion of 'ceruain formalities connected with the Covernment’s claim for Customs on Ojair cargo' as expressed in your letter of 29/10/1932 already referred to. Now, it is beyond our comprehension as to how the Bahrein Government could object to the landing of the Bahrein carg. at Bahrein because of their alleged claim for duty on Ojair car^o which was never intended to be discharged at Bahrein but at Ojair itself. Even if there was such a claim of the Bahrein Government for duty on Ojair cargo, the Bahrein Government could only claim it from the consignees and could not apily their claim to the ship and thereby prohibit the discharge of the Bahrein car, c. s it has however turned up, and to our great regret, all ef orta of the Master of the s.s. •AHLEDI h to discharge at Bahrein, cargo of Bahrein wore frustrated by the attitude of the Bahrein GovernmentSTERN S.

The detention at Bahrein has cost us fe bOOO/- in addition to which we had to pay t 1000/- damages to the Charterers due to the ship's late arrival at Basrah; and these losses are absolutely due to the abovesaid action of the Bahrein GroVerm ont which we consider to be absolutely illegal. e are also very much grieved to learn from the I'astr of the ship that our s.s.'was treated as an undesirable shi: at Bchrein and was completely isolated and even fresh provisions tlu were so very necessary for the Officers and crew of the ship were nt allowed to be supplied to her.

The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, BAHRAIN. &amp; Sir, I have the honour to refer to our conversation on the morning of the 28th December 1932 and to inform you that a protest has been received f!*om the Sa*udi Arab Government in connection with the 'Ahmedi' incident* 2. The sa’udi Arab Government enquire:- (i) what arrangements have been made to avoid the recurrence of such an incident in the future,and (ii) what permanent arrangements can be made for a mutually satisfactory settlement of the transit dues question. 3. It seems possible that the action taken by the State against the 'Ahnedi' might be justified as an isolated case, because the principal shipper of the cargo destined for the Mainland (Muhammad larzuq) deliberately broke his agreement with my predecessor that,if he were allowed overside delivery, he would pay a net 2 % transhipment charge,would undertake to ship not less than 3,000 bags at a time and would refrain from chartering special vessels for carrying cargo direct to the Mainland* It seems,on the other hand,certain that this line of action could not be adopted as a general policy,because of its interference with legitimate trade which would afford grounds for complaints which it would be difficult to rebut,and also because,in the long run,it would lead almost without doubt to the extinction of the transit trade now enjoyed by T iahrain* If, there fore, in future,a vessel should bring cargo pai'’'- for Bahrain and partly for delivery at a rainland port it if&lt;&amp;&gt; i?t&gt; 2. would appear to be impossible to do otherwise than to allow her to land in the ordinary way the cargo consigned to ahrain at iiahrain, 4. It seems clear that the only course open to the Bahrain Government,which is likely to conserve the transit trade,is to make the conditions under which that trade is carried on at Bahrain,so attractive that the trade will of its own volition use Bahrain rather than 1 ainland ports,where there are not the same landing and storage facilities or security; and I under stand that measures designed to achieve this end are under the consideration of the Bahrain Government. 5. I would request that I may be informed whether the Bahrain Government concur with the views expressed in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above. 6 . It seems probable that the best means of coming to a lasting arrangement would be to ask the 3a*udi Arab Government to send a representative,for instance,Muhammad al Tawwil,the Director of Customs for the Hasa Ports,to Bahrain to discuss the question mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter with the Bahrain Government with a view to coming to an amicable and permanent settlement. I would request that I may be informed whether the Bahrain Government concur with this pro posal. Your Most Obedient Servant, I have the honour to be Sir, Lieut Colonel Political Agent,Bahrain,C’s.

To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, BAHRAIN. 0 J 0 Sir, I have the honour to refer to a letter,No *P/139 dated the 21st December 1932,fi*om the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited,Agents at Bahrain of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited,to you,in which they inform you that their Bombay Agents have telegraphed as follows 'Is Bahrain Government prepared to grant concession payment transit fluty Mainland cargo both shipped direct from ocean vessel to country craft for direct shipment and on cargo landed Bahrain for transference to the Mainland later'. and ask you to put them in a position to reply to the telegram. 2. After our meeting on the 28th December 1932 I informed the Hobble the Political Resident that the Bahrain Government was considering various measures for making the Bahrain Port attractive to the steamer transit trade,but suggested that it might be wise to postpone making public any concessions that the Bahrain Government had under contemplation. The Hon'ble the Political Resident has,however,pointed out that the concession of overside delivery in Bahrain waters on payment of transit dues and subject to certain conditions has already been agreed to by the Bahrain Government and that the British India Steam Navigation Company were so informed by him on the 14th October 1932; also that the concession of the payment of transit dues only on cargo landed at Bahrain and re-exported within twenty days to the Mainland had been enjoyed since 1920. In the circumstances the Hobble the Political &gt; Resident thinks that it would be best to inform the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited and also their local.^gentSjthat the Bahrain Government are prepared to grant the concessions mentioned in their telegram* If the Bahrain Government concur with this view it is requested that you will kindly inform the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Agent accordingly and send me a copy of the communication for my records* 3* The Hon’ble the Political Resident further suggests that .A the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited should also be informed of any customs relaxation or other concessions in connection with the transit trade,which the Bahrain Government may be prepared to make * except any general reduction in the present 2% transit dues (if the Bahrain Government contemplate any such reduction) as any such reduction would be a valuable bargaining counter for use should the Bahrain Government agree to the conference with a representative of the Sa’udi Arab Government,suggested in the sixth paragraph of my letter IIosC/1 dated the 6th January 1933. 4. in this connection I enclose a copy of a letter dated the 7th November 1932 from the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited to the Hon'ble the Political Resident and the Political gent and should be glad to be furnished with the views of the Bahrain Government on the suggestions contained in it,and especially on that for an inducement to shippers to ship by regular Steamship Companies by a reduction of the 2 % duty. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant,GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. NO.C. From* To. January 10th 1933* The Adviser to the Government of -Bahrain. H.B.M’s Political Agent. Bahrain, iO Sir, y I have the honour to refer to your letters C/l and C/2 of 6th January 1933 dealing with the matter of the ' Ahmedi ' and the R.E. question. ^ Yesterday I discussed the questions referred to in these two letters with H.E. Shaikh Hamed, Shaikh Sulman was also present* H.E. Shaikh Hamed authorised me to reply to the letters as follows. \ EL&amp;. appreciates the point of view expressed by the Honble; the Political Resident and agrees that it would not be possible for the State to repeat the action taken against the S.S. Ahmedi in the case of other steamers chartered in a similar way visiting Bahrain. He agrees that the policy of the State should be to make the conditions % of re-export trade sufficently attractive to encourage traders to import into the mainland via Bahrain. He is willing to discuss the matter with a representative of the Sa^di Government and would have no objection to the appointment of Shaikh Mohammed al Tawil in this j capacity. Such a discussion however could not be held until after the month of Ramadan. P^ 9 ! Cl With reference to your letter C/2; the concessions which the State proposes to allow are more generous than the Honble the Political Resident realises. ^ The period of free Khanchieh is to be increased from 20 days to 25 days, commencing when the cargo is taken over by the Customs. R.E. cargo will be stored in the customs sheds for 25 days and the importers will pay only the 2% R.E. duty and porterage and will be exempted from payment of Biladya tax and Pier fees for which theyI / GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. are now liable • This concession will cost the State, according to this year’s figures which are unusually low, about 3s 15,000/-. ^ Such cargo will cost the re-exporter exactly the same, apart from cost of landing it, and porterage, as cargo which is transhipped within the port direct from steamer to sailing craft. in one consignment on which direct transhipment is allowed within the port to a minimum 1000 bags. (0 H.S. Shaikh Hamed cannot consider the suggestion of the B.I S.tf Coy: that the State should surrender onehalf of its income from R.E. cargo in order to help the B.I.S.N. Coy: to retain their business, he thinks it should be possible for the Company itself to encourage its regular big shippers by granting them some concession, but not at the cost of the Bahrain State. K.E. Shaikh hamed is also not prepared to relinquish the R.E. duty should this be demanded by the Sa’udi Government as he considers that the State is entitled to collect it. (( He thinks that it would be better not to give publicity to the proposed concessions which I have mentioned above at present but to rftsftrve the srrantimr of them until the discussion takes place with t. Q Also the State is prepared to reduce the minimum number of bags I Wrve the honour to be Sir, v —-— Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.Vi Telegram:- G.T.G. No:- G/10. La tec:- iidth January 1933.

Letter No:C/8b dated the 10th January 1933 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent,Bahrain. sufficiently-2- sul'liciently attractive to retain the transit trade,the Bahrain Government are prepared to make the following arrangements:- (a) to allow direct transhipment within the Pprt limits of consignments of goods,subject to a minimum of 1,000 bags in each consignment, (b) to increase the period of free khanchiyah from 20 to 2b days,reckoned from the date on which the cargo is taken over by the Customs Department,and (c) to limit the charges on re-export cargo stored in the customs sheds up to 25 days to the duty of 2jo and porterage,and to forego Baladiyah ana Pier tees. These arrangements go far to meet the requests that have been made from time to time by merchants. I would add that the Bahrain Government are prepared to reduce,or even to do away with,the minimum of 1,000 bags; and I understand that a minimum was fixed in the first instance at the request of the local Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited,who considered that difficulties might arise if numerous siaall shipments were to be made. 4. I understand that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khaiifah expressed somfdispleasure at the suggestion of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited that the duty on transhipped cargo should be reduced,as he seemed to regard it as asking him to help the Company at the expense of Bahrain. I can understand his taking this point of view and hope that it will prove possible to preserve the transit trade without so costly a concession,but,when and if the time comes for the proposed Conference with a representative of the Sa T udi Arab Government,it should be less difficult,than it would be at the moment,to persuade him to recognise that there is another point of view - that is to say,that to reduce the 2/ 0 duty may be the only means ol saving something out of what may otherwise become a total loss ol the transit trade. It is only a conjecture on my part but I fancy that in his mind is working the idea that but for our insistence on a rate of 2/o there would have been a higher rate from which somethingmight more easily have been given away now. 5. it will be seen that tiie Bahrain Government are averse from announcing to the public the fuller concessions which tney contemplate,pending tne proposed Conference; but I understand that they have communicated them confidentially to the local Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company Limited, i and hope that in all the circumstances this will bafficiently meet your wishes regarding a reply to the Company. I would add that the usual heavy Ramadhan shipments have been made and that those for the Pearling Season are not due for another two and an half months,so that there is not much shipping activity going on at present. It seems,therefore, unlikely that some delay in announcing the concessions would do harm,ana I hope that it may be found possible to arrange for the proposed Conference wiih the Sa’udi Arab Government before the Pearling Season Shipments are made. There is,it is true,an alternative course of making known the concessions, ana using them as a means of impressing on the Sa T udi Arab . Government the goodwill of the Bahrain Government,but I find it hard to beliefce that it would,in fact,have any effect other ^ than to encourage the Sa T udi Arab Government to demand greater concessions. 6. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah agrees to the Conference with a representative of the Sa T udi Arab Govern ment, which you have suggested,and has no objection to Muhammad al Tawwil being the representative of the Sa’udi Arab Govern ment. He asks,however,that it should not take place during Ramadhan. I fully agree that a Conference between the Bahrain Govern- \ ment and a representative of the Sa’udi Arab Government affords the most iikedf means of achieving a satisfactory settlement. I hope that it may be possible for the Bahrain and Sa T udi Arab Governments to come to a friendly agreement over this matter of the transit trade. Both sides have much to gain by a fnendljsettlement of the matter,but there are many conflicting interests,both considerable and petty,and also pride,involved, and it may not be easy for commonsense to prevail.

Bahrain Transit Dues. 2. ;/e do not agree that sending of steamship ”Ahmedi rt amounted to breaking of agreement with in Jiluwi and iviarzuk. That agreement referred only to transhipment of goods in Bahrain territorial waters whereas in ’’Ahmedi' case no transhipment was contemplated. On the other hand it is obvious that if through shipment og go &gt;ds (? to) mainland after landing some cargo at Bahrain became common, Bahrain would be faced with great financial loss and they sould seem to be justified in aking measures in exercise of Their Sovereign rights over Bahrain port to counteract this danger, especially as they charge no port dues for use of port. ’#• can see no alternative to that which tney adopted, via., forbidding landing of goods «t Bahrain except on their own conditions, and consider that it is on these grounds that their action could be defended to Saudi Government and not on grounds of breach of /greement. ... f v 3. tfe also feel doubtful about practicability of adopting line suggested in paragraph 6 of Resident’s telegram which we consider open to following objections^ (l) arrangements of 1920 regarding transhipment dues at Bahrain were made with Ibn Baud by our representative on behalf of Bahrain, and Dickson’s letter G/196 of July 14th,1920, refers to these arrangements as made under his Government’s orders.

I quite concur that sending of AHIIKDI did not break BIN JILL'uWI’S Agreement, and agreement regarded by me as being broken was not Bin Jilluwi’s but the one with MAH^UK. I regret I did not make my meaning clear. 2. Your paragraphs 3 and 4. Bin Jilluwi’s agreement was in fact made direct with Shaikh and not through us. Issues moreover between Bahrain and Saudi Governments are rather complicated, both sides realise that their commercial interests are interdependent, and I feel sure that more satisfactory and speedier results will be obtained by representatives having a friendly ’round table* discussion at Bahrain ( more especially since TAWIL Saudi Director of Customs Ilasa and probable delegate is persona grata with Bahrain Government) than by more formal negotiations conducted at long range through Jedda.
