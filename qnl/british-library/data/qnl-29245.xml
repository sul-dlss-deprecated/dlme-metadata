THEFT OF AMMUNITION. % 18,000 rounds of .303 ammunition have been stolen from the Bahrain Government store on Jida Island. This island is used as a jail as well as an arsenal and Shaikh Khalifah, the Superintendent of police, in his investigation of the theft has arrested the ten policemen and seven prisoners ic ho formed its population. He is endeavouring to obtain evidence from them by methods so notoriously revived by the Gestapo and the Cheka. One source of information states that the N.c.O. in charge of the prison connived at the theft with the aid of t rr o of the prisoners and subsequently sold the ammunition to Persians who have since left Bahrain for an unknown destina tion in Persia. 159. HOUSING SHORTAGI Bahrain is sharing in the world housing shortage by reason of the influx to the Island during the war years ivhich was not, due to the shortage of materials, followed, by an increase in building. The situation was temporarily met by the enforcing of a regulation prescribing maxima in rent increases and limiting very severely the landlord 1 s power either to evict or to terminate a lease. On the whole, landlords accepted these restrictions with a fairly good grace during the war; but, now that it has ended, they seem to to op 1 is responsible for the interests of the tenants most of whom are foreigners - nor His Highness the Shaikh can wholly accept this view. Modifications in the 'Law of Rents' do, however, appear to be necessary and a committee, with representatives from the Agency and the Bahrain Government, has been appointed to report thereon. 160.

Neither the political Agent - who The existing telephones in Bahrain are museum pieces equipped with small handles which need to be \ r ound before the sleepy Arab operator can be induced to reply. The wiring of the system makes it possible to 'listen in' to the conversation of others. Telephoning ordinarily is, therefore, exlTnustivo of time and patience; in the hot weather it results in states verging on insanity. All concerned are accordingly anxiously ! awaiting the installation of an automatic telephone system by Messrs. Cable 8c Uileless, Limited, at the request of the Bahrain Government. Negotiations for an agreement between the two parties are practically complete but the commencement of the installation is being held up by the difficulty being experienced by Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless, Limited, in obtaining land for the new buildings required at a reasonable price and at a suitable site. The political Agent has asked His Highness the Shaikh to help the company and he has promised to do so. 161. CORRIGENDUM. The officer referred to at paragraph 157 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 18 should have been described as / r-QL, I 21 00X194^ INDIA jFFICE /'temporary officer t o o o■ ’’temporary officer of the Royal Indian Naval Reserve”. 162. TH5 TRUCIAL COAST AND THS END OF THE FAR . During his visit reported at paragraph 157 above the Political Agent was enabled to observe the present state of feeling on the Truc.ial Coast. Allied^ and because of their long connection with His, Majesty ’ s Government, more particularly, British prestige, is higher amongst the Shaikhs than ever before. At the same time this has its disadvantage because the prestige is the result of an imagined power - power which the Shaikhs expect to be exercised in providing them with unlimited food and as much arms and ammunition as they can obtain from us. When they realise that these results cannot follow, there may well be a re-action. Even if they are willing they are entirely unable to appreciate that our resources are limited and that their own needs cannot be met without consideration of those of others. 163. U.S.A.T.C.

On the 30th September captain R.C. Murphy, Political Officer, frucial Coast, left by H.M.S. 'Seabelle' for Bushire. 'On the 30th September J.A. Croning, Esq., I.S.O., M.B.E., Under Secretary to the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived by air from India. 151. CRIME . (a) Traffic Offences . The steady increase in traffic accidents which was noted in the Bahrain Government's last annual report has been unfortunately well maintained. This is largely due to the increase in the number of Service and Oil company vehicles driven by locally recruited men many of whom would be unable properly to control a donkey much less a powerful motor lorry. In one case which attracted some attention it was thought at first that the driver was one of this type. Two Indians were knocked down and seriously injured by a ^vehicle which then drove on. Subsequently when the case f was heard by the political Agent, sitting as District 'Magistrate, it was established that the driver was an / officer of the Royal Indian Navy. He was convicted of an offence under section 338 of the Indian penal Code and sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment and a line of Rs.1,000/-• (b) Thefts . Both in Uanamah and Muharraq, there has, for.some time past, been an epidemic of thieving. partly this is due to the lowering of what in the Bahraini passes for 'moral standards'; more particularly it seems to be.due to the inadequacy of the police arrangements. At night these consist of 'Naturs' (watchmen) who are supposed to patrol the town. They are only paid Rs.25/- to us.30/- per month, and as most of them are married and (despite the demands of their calling) have children, it is impos sible for them to live on this amount. They are thought to have connived at, if not actually committed some of the thefts. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed, the Super intendent of Police, seems to enjoy the pursuit of fish more than that of thieves. He is a keen deep sea angler. ^ 152. 1LANAKAH T0 rr N vr AT5R SUPPLY. His Highness the Shaikh sanctioned the expenditure for this scheme before’ the war; and it had got as far as calling for estimates for machinery, etc., when the war brake out. The State authorities have now again.shorn commendable activity in the matter and, at their instance, Mr. Jones of Holloway Brothers visited Bahrain during the /period....the installation of the water supply plant By nis firm. Ho anticipated no difficulty in the execution of the plan provided that materials (including piping and so on) could be obtained from the United Kingdom. Every effort will be made to do this as soon as possible* 153. REMOVAL OF WARTIME CONTROLS - SAUDI ARABIA . The Saudi Arabs in Bahrain state that the Financo Ministry at Hasa has issued a notice by order of Kis Majesty the King, announcing that the restrictions on the Saudi export trade will be removed on the 26th Dil Qada 1364 (1.11.1945). 154. P ETROLEUM CONCESSIONS, LIMITED . Petroleum concessions, Limited, whose activities practically entirely ceased during the war, now hope to re-open their Qatar fields in 1946 and to send a small explo ratory party to the Trucial Coast in the coming cold weather. 155. S HAIKH OF SHARJAH . • k i The Shaikh of Sharjah net and entertained Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, brother of the Ruler of Bahrain, when he arrived at Sharjah en route to Bahrain from India. Very typically, the Shaikh of Sharjah seized the opportunity to importune Shaikh Abdulla to help him in obtaining an export permit for motor cycles from Bahrain. Shaikh Abdulla promised that he would do so and, very typically, will do nothing about it. 156.

The announcement on the evening of the 15th August came as somewhat of an anti-climax to that of V-E Day three months previously. Celebrations were more reserved and the inevitable lassitude engendered by the month of Ramadhan undoubtedly played its part. Flags were flown on all public buildings but those on private houses and even barasti’ huts were less conspi cuous than on V-E Day. The 16th, 17th, 19th and 20th August were observed as public holidays. On the 17th August, the Assistant Political Agent received local notables after sunset in the Agency garden and on the 20th August a reception was given for the British and American community. 135.

LABOUR TROUBLES - 6APC0. survey from n is to Mis^covfer Mecca to ?Tuscat l 1945 the / Some 30 South African employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company submitted a demand in mid-August for increases in pay and a.general rise in the rates payable to South Africans to bring them into line with those of Canadian and - eventually - American employees of the Company. Attempts to negotiate with the employees indi vidually were met with a refusal to discuss terms except through representatives of the strikers. *&gt; Eventually, some 20 South Africans, nearly all of whom were operators in the refinery, stayed away from work and on the 25th August the Company discharged them for cause. The employees refused to accept transportation and a large deputation waited on the Assistant Political Agent that day to air their grievances. After discussions lasting several hours with three representative spokesmen and also with Mr. Tr rard Anderson, the Chief Local Represent ative, the strikers decided to accept transportation back to South Africa where they apparently intend taking legal advice to remedy their contention that discharge for cause was not warranted. So ended the first organised attempt in Bapco of non-American employees to obtain for themselves the same rates of pay as for American personnel. The problem is not new and the same difficulties have arisen from this question in other oil companies. The strike and dismissal of so many operators resulted in the shutting down of two crude stills and one reformer in the Refinery. 138. LABOUR TROUBLES - DHAHRAN. The strike of Italian workers in Aramco was no sooner settled than a general strike of Arab employees was declared. The American Vice-Consul in Dhahran, Mr. Birge, informed the Assistant Political Agent that the strikers were ordered by His Majesty the King to return to work and delegates from the Oil Company, the strikers, and Saudi officials met to discuss their grievances. Mr. Birge anticipates the Company having to make some concessions in increases of rates of pay to their employees but the result of meetings of representatives is not known as yet. 139. PERILS OF THE DEEP. On the 30th August, a local fisherman was brought ashore near the Agency for burial. He had been killed by a small sword-fish that leapt over the net with which he and fifty others were dragging the deep and impaled him in the stomach. 140. METEOROLOGICAL.

QATAR AGAIN. ' * ' ' . _ .. — Reference paragraph 106 of these summaries. • For an hour and a half, after sitting with him in the Joint Court, the Political Agent listened to His Highness the Sheikh on the subject of his claims, rights, wrongs.and griev ances in and concerning Qatar. Since the implication of most of the Sheikh's arguments was, as usual, that he had sovereign rights in part of Qatar territory (Zubarah) - rights which His Majesty's Government have never admitted - the conversa tions resulted in little else but the exhaustion of the Political Agent. 117. THE WEAT r !ER AND THE ELECTRICAL SUPPLY . The local people say that for ten years Bahrain.has not had weather of the severity experienced within the period covered by this summary. For days and nights without inter mission the heat has been steamy and intense, and there has been no wind to relieve the continuous furnace-like atmosphere or ruffle the oily expanse of water in Manamah bay. .It was during this that fate decreed that the electrical system in Bahrain should sporadically cease to function for long hours at a time. The reasons for this are that the engines driving the generators are old, and more particularly (and more importantly) they have never been properly maintained. The present State Engineer received them as a somewhat grim legacy and during the last fortnight has -Mopn nerharts Land this is JNP1&amp; OFFICE * /saying...- 2 - T?l -T/' ± A? i iU saying a good deal) the most har4ssed man in Bahrain.

Forty to fifty B.A.F. personnel have been flown out of Bahrain as a result of heat exhaustion and severe 'prickly heat' - a skin disease which in its mildest form produces nervous irritation and when severe can be acutely poisonous - no European or Indian in Bahrain is now free' from it. Many of the Arabs also suffer. There are 17 Indian Other Ranks in hospital with heat stroke. MIS. T HEFT IN BAP CO STORE . Reference paragraph 104 of intelligence Summary No.13 of 1945. Minnick has now given notice of his intention to » appeal against his sentence. 119 * AMERICAN PLANE MISHAP . On the 29th. July it was reported to the political Agent that an American plane travelling from Karachi to Abadan had been lost for the last two days. It had been last heard of east of Sharjah but had sent no distress signals. political Agents, Muscat and Kuwait, and’the Residency Agent at Sharjah were informed. On the same day the wreckage of this plane was discovered by Bedouin 13^ miles south-east of Dubai, and reported to the Royal Air Force. Rescue parties were rushed to the spot and the bodies of three of the crew removed to Abadan by air for burial. The wreckage has been examined with a view to dis covering the cause of the crash but its results are not yet known here. 120. AMERICAN SURVEY PARTY . Reference paragraph 108 of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1945. The American Survey Par-ty returned to Sharjah from Buraimi and Abu Dhabi on the 7th after completing their work in those areas. On the 15th they left Sharjah by launch on a voyage along the coast up to Ras Dibah. 121. TRUCIAL COAST .

THE GENERAL ELECTION - LOCAL OPINION . The Sheikh and his followers here are naturally firm believers in the superiority of rule by one man, or at most, by him and his few advisers; and, fundamentally, this is generally accepted as the form of government destined for the sons of Adam. To such a view the deposition of Mr. Churchill from his high place, and the discarding of his leadership with the war still unfinished has come as /something...JO SECRET. No. 13 of 1945.

This was reported at paragraph 96 of these summaries. The trial in the Sessions Court-of Edward Minnick (A merica n) and Arthur Koch (Canadian) concluded on the 4th of July. ~ Koch xvas acquitted and Minnick sentenced to one year's simple imprisonment under Section 381, Indian Penal Code. It is understood that he intends to appeal against his conviction. I The general local opinion seems to be that he deserved this sentence ahd, indeed, that it was lenient. 10 5. RICE IMPORTS . A certain amount of rice has recently been imported into Bahrain privately from Persia. Efforts by the^local Government to control its sale resulted in the immediate stoppage of the imports and their diversion to Saudi Arabia where, presumably, the prices are not controlled. 106. QATAR . The agreement signed by the Shaikhs of Bahrain and ^atar in June, 1944, has not, unfortunately,^terminated the illfeeling between the two States and this has easily found expression in conflicting interpretations - a very 3 asy matter for both parties since it would not have been signed had it been first framed in any but the vaguest terms. These merely stated that conditions should revert to those persisting before the split occurred between, the two States in 1936. The Shaikh of Bahrain has taken this to mean that the Shaikh of Qatar's previous prohibition of* the entrance of Bahrainis to the west coast of Qatar has DeeQ rescinded and tested his view by sending some of his subjects there to collect lime. They were promptly expelled laving been ill-treated and this, with similar in stances, las formed the subject of unfructt^^Jo^E^S^^ence between ^ thethe Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar via the political Agent for several months past. 107. R OYAL AIR FORCE. SHAHJAS - (1) Reference paragraph 78(i) of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 10. The two Indian N.C.Os. are still under close arrest awaiting trial by Court Martial. The reason for the delay in bringing these men to trial is not known. (2) During the period under report the sum of Rs. 23^000/- was stolen from the safe in the Accounts Office of the R.A.F. H.Qc The key of the safe was kept in a smaller safe the key of which was held by the Accounts Officer. The key of the small safe was found to be missing and when a duplicate was obtained the theft was discovered. It is thought to be an '•inside job” involving only R.A.F. personnel. The stolen money was in Rs. 10 and Rs. 100 currency notes but no record of the numbers was kept. Notes of smaller denominations amounting o about Rs. 60,000 were untouched. The Assistant provost Marshal came to Sharjah from R.A.F. HQ. to investigate the theft but so far no arrests have been made nor has the money been traced. 108. U .StA.T.C . An American Survey party (Lieutenant Moore and 4 G.I.s) have arrived in Sharjah. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast^, . # arranged for them to visit Abu Dhabi and the area west of Buraimi, They left for Abu Dhabi on the 27th June and arrived there on the 29th. They stayed one night in Abu Dhabi and left for Buraimi ' the next day. They are in daily wireless contact with Sharjah. 109. RAS AL KHAIMAH . On the 24th June. Mr. B.H. Lermitte of Messrs, petroleum Concessions Limited went to Sharjah by air and stayed at the B.O.A.C. Fort there.

The Ruler signed the agreement on the 21st June and left for Sharjah by air the following day. 96. THEFT AT BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY STORE . On the 15th June, one‘American and one Canadian, employees of the Bahrain petroleum company, were.taken into custody by the local police on a charge of stealing twenty motor tyres from a Bahrain petroleum Company Store. Another American, accused of abetment, was released on bail. . The Assistant political Agent, who heard the case as a magistrate, discharged this man but committed the two others to Sessions. The case has now to come before the political Agent as a Sessions Court. Detection of the alleged theft appears to have been made possible by information given to the Police by a local taxi-driver to the effect that one of the accused had promised to sell him tyres. 97. MARRIAGE OF THE RULER . It is rumoured that His Highness the Sheikh will. shortly marry his third ]vife, the daughter of one Abdulla al Zaid, ex-pearl merchant, already related by marriage to the Al Khalifa The bride is said to be beautiful and the marriage.to have none but the simplest motives. The wedding will be quiet. 98* TRUCIAL COAST . (i) On the 14th Shaikh Humaid bin Mohd. bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah left Sharjah for Ras al Khaimah with two of his men, one of whom was of the Huboos and the other of^ the Ghaflah tribes. On the way, between Jirri and Ras al Khaimah, the Ghafli bedouin killed the Hibsi who was armed, looted Shaikh Humaid 1 s money (estimated to be about Rs. 800/- ).ard his clothing and made a get away towards Dubai. Shaikh Humaid was unarmed except for his dagger. A pursuit party was sent after the culprit but he has not yet been apprehended. He is said to nave ' , . -i mu ^^ / taken.....-2- j a ' j s O i ! taken refuge with shaikh Muhammad bin Ali b ; in Huwaidin of [the Beni Qitab. (ii) The one-year-old camel looting □ d s dispute between Muhammad bin Ali bin Rubayyi f , Chief of the Beni Qitab of the Aflaj, and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has reached a critical stage, and skirmishes between the parties are expected to take . place at any moment. The shaikh of Abu Dhabi considers himself strong enough to cope with situation and has sent supplies of rice and grain to his men at A1 ’Ain in Buraimi and has ordered the withdrawal of his camels for use in repulsing any raids by the Beni Qitab.. It is only expected that raids will be made by the Beni Qitab in the Buraimi area. 99. THE INDIAN FILM UNIT. Reference paragraph 91 of Bahrain intelligence Summary No. 11 of 1945. The Indian Film Unit left by launch for the scene of the pearling operations on the 24th and returned on the 26th June. They expect to leave for India the first week of July. 100. L ABOUR TROUBLES . The Municipal scavengers struck for higher wages on the 26th instant. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie’s stevedores and boatmen made similar demands on the 28th., and the taxi-drivers were contemplating making them at the same time. The ’’Zeitgeist” explains these happenings but their immediate occasion seems to have been the action of a Palestinian contractor imported by the A.M.W.D. to engage and work labour for the new air-strip at Muharraq aerodrome. This man broke, in the spirit at any rate, an unwritten (and very flexible) agreement between employers of labour here, to pay the same wages for similar work. The results were a flow of labour to him, general unrest amongst all labour in the Island and the strikes and threats of striking just reported. The situation was met by his stopping recruit ment and dismissing a token number of coolies. The Bahrain Petroleum Company had not, fortunately, to face a strike but did lose temporarily, a number of their workmen. Two points were emphasised by these happenings. Firstly, the labour market here is a seller’s and not a buyer’s market; secondly, the island being such a compact unit, the labour as a whole is immediately sensitive to any changes made in the conditions of any section of it. The attitude of labour, and indeed lesser employees of all kinds, is an unattractive mixture of inde pendence and superficial servility. 101. METEOROLOGICAL .

The object of his visit is reported to be the obtaining of a working oil concession instead of the present Exploration Permit from Messrs. Petroleum Concessions, Limited. Shaikh Sultan is staying with the Ruler of Bahrain. 85. SAUDI ARABIA .

' His Majesty expressed himself in reply as being very touched by Lord Wavell•s references to His Majesty’s kindness. 86. DUBAI. In May, two bedouins (one of the al Bu Shamis and the other of the Awamir) ‘tried to loot some Dubai camels at Um- Iqsais, about 5 miles from Dubai. Two Awamir bedouins, who were rafiqs of the Shaikh of Dubai, resisted the attack and killed the Shamisi bedouin and wounded the Awamiri Who was taken to Sharjah where the R.A.F. medical officer treated the bullet wound in his back. 87. SYRIA AND THE LEBANON. [to the Political Agent Many Arabs including the Shaikh of Bahrain have, expressed^ their satisfaction at the British action taken in Syria and the Lebanon. Local feeling is tinreservedly and vehemently anti- French. y 88.. - ZUBARAH . On the 6th of June, the Political Agent was His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain who treated him f( time to lengthy and discursive complaints against tl Qatar. Most of these concerned petty incidents bul a! i rOmeupi - 2 - leitmotif was that the Shaikh of Qatar had not observed his side of the agreement reached last June. The agreement is so vague that it is extremely difficult to determine who is either breaking or keeping it. It did not, as Mr. Gandhi would say, result in any 'change of heart' and it is hard to believe that relations are really much improved. 89. SHAIKHA AY5SHA . Reference Daragraph 70 of intelligence Summary No. 9 of 1945. The political Agent returned the call of Shaikha Ayesha on June the 9th. 90. OIL. When the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company recently visited His Highness the Shaikh, the latter told him that he was not sleeping well. On the Manager's enquiring the reason and expressing sympathy, the Shaikh replied that there was far too much oil moving about under the ground where he slept and that more of it should be taken out. 9!. INDIAN FILM UNIT . / Reference paragraph 80 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary •No. 10. The Indian Film Unit have been prevented from visiting the scene of the pearling operations so far, first by their unwillingness to go to sea in the launch provided for them, and secondly by a strong 'shemal' wind which blew during the last few days of this period. They have filled in time filming Bahrain and hope to take a further set of photographs of Bapco and B.O.A.C. installations and personnel. On the 10th June, they visited Sharjah by R.A.F. plane and took shots of the B.O.A.C. Station there and planes alighting and leaving. 92. METEOROLOGICAL .

THE TRUCIAL COAST . During his few days on the Trucial Coast the Political Agent renewed acquaintance with the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Dubai, Ajman and Has al Khaima and met for the first time Mohd. bin Ali bin Huwaithin, Chief of the Bani Qitab, one of the most powerful tribes of the hinterland. The Chief was at a dinner given by the Shaikh of Dubai for the Political Agent. Also present was Mohd. as-Sulaiman of the Al Bu Shamis to whose protestations that he was his u humble servant'*, King ^bn Saud is said to have remarked 'and an humble friend, Shaikh, of the Sultan of Muscat'. Like all of his kind, he is an humble servant when it pays him to be one. 78. ROYAL AIR FORCE. SHARJAH . (i) Reference paragraph 69(i) of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 9. ,ooe&lt;-. ’Iraq The case was referred to South^Area Headquarters, P.A.I.C., who sent Special Investigation Bureau personnel to carry out further investigations. The result of these investi- y ' ' 0 • gations is not known as the Special investigation Bureau Officers apparently left Sharjah without reporting to the . Station Commander. It appears, however, that the original investigation was inadequate and inefficiently carried out. The two N.C.O.s are still under arrest and awaiting trial. The delay on the part of A.H.Q. in convening a Court Martial is presumably due to the incomplete evidence and the belief that other persons were involved in the shooting. There is no reason to apprehend further trouble breaking out in the Company. (ii) Reference paragraph 69(ii) of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No. 9. # The case against the Sepoy has been dropped due to lack of evidence. The Political Officer, however, has reason to believe that many of the defence witnesses committed perjury. (iii) At about 10 a.m. on the 15th an R.A.F. truck crashed into a reed hut in Sharjah and killed a sick man who was lying inside and then drove on without stopping. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, went to the scene of the accident after calling upoh the Royal Air Force authorities to take immediate steps to trace and apprehend the driver of the vehicle. ^ In vest !' gations resulted in the tracing of the vehicle and the arresl} of the driver who has been arrested and charged with mah- • slaughter. i 25JUN1945 /l UHPIA OFFIC E(&gt; - 2 *- . 1945 • It appears that the vehicle belongs 'to the F# Anti- Malaria Squad who, in the course of their duty, left it on the morning of the accident, outside the village in charge of an Aircraftsman who,was not a qualified driver. For some unknown reason he attempted to drive the vehicle and entered the village where, from the track marks it is apparent that he lost control. He first collided with the parapet of a small well, swerved to avoid a fence, crashed through the reed hut, drove on a short distance, stopped, backed into another fence and then drove off. The deceased was a Persian working as a coolie in the R.A.F. camp and the question of paying compensation to his family is under consideration. 79. PEARLING . Reference paragraph 72' of Bahrain intelligence Summary No. 9. Employment on Bahrain Petroleum Company and Service works still absorbs many divers, but high prices las-t year were an encouragement and pearlers are paying very good wages to divers who will work for them, often much in excess of the Government rate. The price of a Jiwen (first quality) pearl at present is Rs. 180/- per CHAW*, and there is a strong demand from Indian buyers. Ramzan has divided the pearling season_in half* The first began on May 19th and will continue until August 5th. The second half begins on September 10th and goes on to October 31st and will be a better time for diving in the calmer seas after the monsoon. 80. INDIAN FILM UNIT.

As hour by hour our publicity made V.E. Day more obviously imminent there were local attempts to 'jump the flag'; the anxiety to celebrate, coupled with the normal nervous tension of the Arab, could, not wait for.the official 'all clear'. When it did come there was inevitably a tinge of anti-climax in the picture. Nevertheless, flags during the day and lights at night made a brave show. The squibs were old and damp but their dulness only a reminder that material for making them was for use in sterner fire works. Floodlights on the Agency did the wonders of make-up for its diurnal face. The 9th, lOth, and 14th were public holidays. congratulations on the defeat • of Germany were received from all classes coupled not infrequently with the hope that Burma would soon be freed and rice again, available to the Musalmeeji in pre-war plentitude. On the afternoon of the 9th May the political Agent held a reception for local notables, and on the evening of the fol lowing day he entertained members of the British and American communities. /67.

MIDDLE EAST ANTI-LOCUST UNIT . Messrs. Vesey-FitzGerald and Thesiger of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit visited Bahrain on May 8th and left the next day. They held consultations with the Political Agent regarding their proposed journeys in the Trucial Coast area. 69 . ROYAL AIR FORCE.-SHARJAH . (i) At about 0400 hrs. on the morning of the 19th firing broke out in the lines of No. 1261 Indian Pioneer Company. The n Alarm' was sounded and the body of a Hindu Sepoy was found shot through the head with Service rifle by his side. There were no other casualities although it was found that about 12 shots had been fired into the tent occupied by the Company V.C.Os. At first, it appeared that the Sepoy had run amok and had committed suicide after trying to murder his Indian Officers. Further investigation however, revealed what appeared to be a plot by other members of the Company to murder the V.C.Os. and evidence to show that the Sepoy had been murdered. The motive for this attempt to kill the V.C.Os. of the Company is not known, nor is it known why. the Sepoy was murdered, unless it was to give inci dent the appearance of one man running amok and then committing suicide. A Court of Inquiry was held and two N.C.O.s have been arrested and are awaiting trial by Court Martial on a charge of murder. The company has been disarmed and the British Officer Commanding it has been evacuated by air suffering from a complete mental breakdown. (ii) Reference paragraph 58(ii) of I.S. No. 8 of 1945. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, had reason to believe that the enquiry into this alleged assault was not being conducted v/ith due expediency and efficiency. He, therefore, after conferring with the Officer Commanding Station, took the woman concerned to the camp with a view to holding an identification parade. The Officer Commanding the Company (No. 506 A.W.) informed the Political Officer that the feeling in the Indian camp was running high due to shooting incident in No. 1261 Company referred to in (i) above, and he was not in favour of holding a public identification parade until the H extent of the disaffection (if any) was known and the situation had returned to normal. He agreed, however, to take all the men answering in any way to the description given by the woman in a •lorry to a place outside the camp and there to hold an identifica tion parade. This was arranged, but on returning to his car, which was. parked in the middle of the camp, the political Officer was informed by the woman that she had already recognized the man who. had attacked her. Most of the company at this time were engaged in striking tents and she pointed out the Sepoy, an elderly Sikh with grey hair. Summary of evidence proceedings against this Sepoy are still in progress, the result of which will be reported in due course. The evidence recorded up to date, however, establishes a strong alibi for the accused person and, as a result of this and the absence of any eye witnesses, it is not expected that the case will reach the stage of a Court Martial. 70. THE SHAIKHA AYESHA . On May 10th the Political Agent called (at the lady^s request) on the Shaikha Ayesha, the widow of the late Ruler of / /Bahrain....% r -3- 945 . j Bahrain.

MOVEMENTS OF OFFICIALS . (i) On the 16th April, C.J. Felly, Esq., O.B.E., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain, left in the P.C.L. launch 'Ghazal' for Qatar arriving there after a somewhat rough passage, on the morn ing of the 17th, During his stay the political Agent called on His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim A1 Thani, C.I,E,, Ruler of Qatar, whose lively, almost mischievous, manner belies his frail appearance. The Shaikh’s son, Hamad bin Abdullah bin Qasim in whose hands his father entrusts all state affairs, 1 attended the political Agent on several occasions. He had (in view of Qatar’s reputation for smuggling) the Qall to com plain that supplies were short. The Political AgSnt also met other Qatar notables. He returned to Bahrain on the 18th April. (ii) On the 17th April Captain R.C. Murphy, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, left by air for Sharjah. (iii) On the 29th April the Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., arrived in H.M.S. 'Seabelle' from Muscat. (iv) Air Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst, C.B.E., O.B.E., M.C., Air Officer Commanding in chief, Middle East, accompanied by Air Vice-Marshal R. George, C.B.E., M.C., arrived in Bahrain from Sharjah on the 28th of April and left the next day. 57. BAHRAIN RULING FAMILY. (i) On the 19th April, Shaikh Salman bin Mohammed, fifth son of the senior uncle of the Ruler of Bahrain, left by air for Jerusalem to take up a course of judicial training. (ii) On the afternoon of April 21st Shaikh Rashid bin Abdulla, a cousin of the Ruler, visited the political Agent. On the next morning a carpenter working in the Agency was imprisoned. The incidents are connected because Shaikh Rashid came to complain that he was being exiled by the Ruler for , drinking, and the carpenter was imprisoned for acting as.the Shaikh’s bootlegger. During his interview with the Political Agent, the Shaikh simulated weeping with a fair degree of success and his manner was vaguely offensive; he was, in fact, drunk. His lapse, and more particularly his punishment, was most welcome to his father since it was occasioned by, or perhaps merely the accompaniment, of his successful seduction of one of the latter’s mistresses. The story (worthy of the 'Arabian Nights') is being retailed locally with gleeful and Rabelaisian embellishments. 58. R.A.F.. SHARJAH . (i) On the night of lst/2nd at about 2.30 a,m. one of the Royal Air Force lorries, driven by an unknown person, ran into and damaged several reed huts and reed sheds at the entrance of Dairah (Dubai) bazaar. The matter was reported by the Shaikh of Dubai to the Residency Agent who on hi brought it to the notice of the Officer Commanding, Roy /Force rt. PSL’BEPT, l Air 25 MAY 194-5 INDIA OFFICE- 2 - Force, Sharjah, and asked him to institute the necessary enquiries. The Residency Agent also went to Dubai and inspected the damage done. The Commanding Officer replied that he had instituted a thorough investigation; but that without any concrete evidence to go upon, it was difficult to find the offender. He, hov/ever, promised to continue his investigation and to let the Residency Agent know as soon as definite information has been obtained. Meanwhile the Commanding Officer and his Adjutant went to the Ruler of Dubai and apologised to him and assured him that if it v/as proved that R.A.F. personnel were responsible* severe disciplinary action would be taken against the offenders. In the meantime the Royal Air Force, as a fylandiy gesture, are sending a work party to repair the damaged places. (ii) On the 9th a local woman named Halimah bint Hamad complained to the Shaikh of Sharjah that while she was on her way from the garden to the town an Indian soldier tried to rape her and when she refused to give in, he beat her severely and tore up her clothes. The Shaikh at once took a tracker and went himself with the v/oman to the place where the inci dent happened and then to the Army quarters following the footprintw of the offender. He thpn returned and reported the matter to the Residency Agent who at once communicated with the Commanding Officer and asked him to make the necessary investigations. The offender has not yet been discovered but enquiries are in progress. 59* INDIAN FILM UNIT . An Indian Film Unit under the direction of the Infor mation and Broadcasting Department of the Government of India arrived in Bahrain on the 1st of April, 1945, on a. tour of the Persian Gulf and Oman with a view to preparing a documentary film showing the interest of India in this area. They had previously stayed for three days at Sharjah. First reports on their results of the filming here indicate that they were successful. The party left for Kuwait by air on the 14th of April and returned to Bahrain on the 20th. They left on L. T. ’‘Nearchus' for a tour of the Persian Gulf ports on the 21st of April. They will visit Lingah, Bandar Abbas and Elphinstone Inlet en route to Muscat._ They are expected to return on the 3rd of May and then to film the pearling which starts about the middle of May. 6 0- PEACE MOVES AND PRICES .

As soon as lunch was over the Hon* ble the political Resident addressed the gathering 'arid then returned to Sharjah. It is worthy of note that all the rulers of Trucial Oman were present at this gathering•with the exception of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi' who did not attend partly by reason of the fact that the launch which carried his invitation was wrecked • and partly because of the distance it would have been necessary for him to travel had he received the invitation. The greatest amiability prevailed during the gathering and the Shaikhs appeared to be on very cordial terms with each other though with one excep tion they all appeared as is customary armed to the teeth. The exception was the most warlike of them all, Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali bin Huweidhan, the paramount Shaikh of the Beni Gitab, who out of courtesy to ^the Resident, arrived with his followers unarmed.

Fatal Motor Accident On the 8th a serious motor accident occurred between Awali and Manama as a result of which five persons were killed and twelve others received injuries. The accident was due to a collision between two lorries, one loaded with coolies, at a narrow part of the road close to a heap of rubble which many years ago may have been a Shia mosque. The Shia qadis have persistently refused to permit the^removal of this and similar mounds and His Highness has hesitated to overrule their decisions as he is himself a Sunni. However it has now been decided to widen the road very considerably and to by-pass these ancient ruins. 27. Murder at Abu Dhabi On the night of 4th February Roopchand Parmanand a Hindu resident of Abu Dhabi was strangled and afterwards stabbed in his house at Abu Dhabi. It seems that.he had been in residence for over fifty years in Abu Dhabi and besides dealing in pearls and grain had been in the habit of purchasing stolen property. Khamis ibn al Noubi a slave of Ahmed bin Khalaf bin Ataiba conceived the idea that the. Hindu was particularly wealthy and went to him one evening ostensibly, to sell him a small quantity of gold and having persuaded the Hindu to -dismiss his servant proceeded to kill him. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi took immediate action which resulted in the apprehension and confession of the accused. The Shaikh has stated that he will take, whatever action it is considered desirable by the political authorities. 28.

On the 16th the Political Agent accompanied by Mr. Parker T. Hart visited the Shaikh of Ajman and expressed his dis satisfaction with his recent conduct in connection with a weather-bound dhow carrying supplies to Umm-al-Quwain from Dubai. The Shaikh had prevented any attempt at rescue until the Nakhuda of the dhow had agreed to somewhat severe salvage terms. Later the same day the Political Agent drove via Falaij-ahl-Ali to Ras-al-Khaimah. On the 17th it had been intended to return to Sharjah via Dhaid but owing to heavy rains making the so called roads quite impassable Jhe night of the 17th/18th was spent some few miles inland from Ras-al-KJaaimah and the return to Sharjah was accomplished on the 18th 'vn.th great difficulty.

Hart visited Dubai not without difficulty owing to further rain which had resulted in considerable flooding.

The purpose of the Ii S: Yr 4 dS not 30 far keen disclosed nor has Mr. Parker l„ Hart, the Vice consul for the United States of America at Dhahran, received any information regarding all their intentions.

Market conditions There is a general downward trend in the prices of some goods. This is probably due to the satisfactory news from the western Front which was followed by a fall in the exchange rate of the Sovereign from Rs.65/- to Rs.59/-. it remains to be seen whether,, as so often has been the case in the past, this is merelya temporary fall due to first reactions to the Allied suc cesses being somewhat wild selling by gold speculators., Anti-Locust Campaign on the Trucial coast 16 During the course of the political Agent's recent tour on the Trucial Coast he met two members of the Anti-Locust Mission, one a Punjabi Mussalnan and the other a Sikh from the Amritsar district, working in the interior. They .appeared to be carrying on their work in difficult and strange sur roundings with great good humour and keenness. Some hatching is expected shortly from the Ras-al-Khaimah area, probably on much the s§me scale as occurred last year. The Anti-Locust officer has not been able to make a very wide survey of his area owing to lack of mechanical transport necessitating the use of camels with the consequent slowing up of the work. 17* Qatar Affairs Reference paragraph 22;of intelligence Summary No.24 of 1944. Recently the shaikh of Qatar informed the Political Agent that it was his intention to replace his guards at Zubarah by three watchmen whose sole duty would be to look after the,fit tings, &amp;c., of the fort. The difference between a watchman and a guard is it is feared too subtle to be detected by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. 18.

The Bahrain petroleum Company Limited * (i) Labour. On the 4th of January Mr. T - T ard P. Anderson the General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company informed the political Agent that he had heard disquieting rumours which indicated that there was a possibility of a strike of local labour at the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Careful enquiries were made but no confirmation whatsoever was obtained of the intention of the local employees of the Company to indulge in such co-ercive action. It was apparent that the transportation arrangements for the carriage of unskilled labour to and from their employment were unsatisfactory and the General Manager took such action as lay within his power to remedy defects in the system. Unfortunately the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and replacements for damaged material has so far proved insuperable so that the position is not as satisfac tory as could be desired. The difficulties of the Company’s administration are at least in part understood by their labour and the management have been advised by the political Agent to obtain sanction to bring into operation, should it become necessary, increases in the war allowance of the lower pay grades. This action will probably have the effect of prevent ing a disruption in the Company’s work until April 1st when it is anticipated the Refinery construction programme will have advanced sufficiently to permit of the discharge of some 2,000 local employees and the return to the United States of America of approximately 300 men from the Berchtel McCone Corporation. The company hope that the full programme for construction will be completed by the 1st of June* (ii) Drum Plant. Some 600 Indian troops have recently arrived at Bahrain for the purpose of dealing with the shipping of 100 octane drums at Sitrah. 6. Bahrain Labour Committee On the 11th a meeting of the Bahrain Labour Committee under the presidency of the political Agent was held at which it was confirmed that transportation would have to be provided between Muharraq and Manamah for labour employed at the Royal Air Force construction work on the latter island. It was also agreed that efficiency pay was reasonable provided it did not exceed an annual maximum increase in the daily rates beyond Annas eight. The Committee expressed their concern with regard to the scarcity of labour not only at the present time but also should further construction programmes have to be under taken later in the spring. 7. Iraqi artisans The Bahrain Petroleum Company have recruited approximately 280 artisans from Iraq for temporary work on the Refinery con struction. It is understood from the General Manager that the men have proved good workmen and no trouble of any description has been experienced. This happy state of affairs does not ^appear to have existed at the Arabian American Oil Company’s ^ works at Dhahran for reports reaching the Political Agent indi cate that there have been a number of cases of misunderstanding between the management of the Company and the artisans they have recently recruited from Iraq. 8* Thefts of Royal Air Force ammunition at Muharraq \ Reference paragraph No.214 of Intelligence Summary No.23 of 1944.

Six of them were of British registry^ four American, and one Norwegian. The imports-wyene 2,043 tons for Bahrain and 898 tons transhipment cargo for Saudi Arabia. The exports consisted of 65 tons general cargo and 93,644 tons petroleum products. One ship was still in port at the end of the period. 220. Visitors (i) The Senior Naval Officer Persian Gulf arrived on the 21st. and left for Khor Quwai on the 22nd. i 5 (ii) Reference paragraph 198(ii) of intelligence Summary No.22 of 1944. His Highness’ uncles Shaikh Mohamed and Shaikh Abdullab bin Isa returned from hawking in Held on the 21st. 221, Italian labour for Arabian American Oil Company, Dhahran. On the 16th Mr. C.W. Ohliger, General Manager of the ' Arabian American Oil Company, arrived from Cairo by air and left for Dhahran on the 17th. Mr. Ohliger has been personally supervising the transport of eightyeight Italians from Eritrea to Saudi Arabia*. It is understood that these men are the vanguard of approximately 1,200 Italians who are to be 'employed on construction work at Ras Tanurah. They came to Bahrain by uir and were transhipped into smaller planes at Muharraq aerodrome and flown immediately to Dhahran. His Highness the Shaikh though surprised granted permission for this to be done and asked that Mr. Ohliger should be informed that on no account did he desire the Italians to pay visits to Bahrain as is customary f^r the Americah employees of the Company to do. 222. ^ Qatar Affairs Reference paragraph No.212 of Intelligence Summary No.23 of 1944. The situation with regard to the supply of foodstuffs and other quota goods to Qatar is still causing concern and as far as is known the Shaikh of Qatar has made no effort to withdraw his guards from Zubara. Bahrain Judiciary After consulations with the Political Agent His - Highness has decided that his nephew Shaikh Salman bin Mohamed should go to Palestine to study Law and Court Practice with a view to his being appointed a fudge in the Bahrain courts on his return. The High Commissioner for Palestine and the Palestine Government have very kindly agreed to make the necessary arrangements for .— ~ ... Shaikh Salman's legal training. It is hoped that he wIJIECaA - , f leave early in the New Year. 3 0 JANWA 224.

The Imperial Bank of Iran, Limited, Bahrain. The Imperial Bank of Iran opened a, branch in Bahrain on the 16th of December. The result of the arrival of the Imperial Bank of Iran in Bahrain has been that it has acted as a stimulus to the Eastern Bank and there is every indication that the move will be beneficial to business and private interests. 226. coke shipments Reference paragraph No.183 of Intelligence Summary No.20 of 1944. Mr. A.E. Jones of Messrs. L. Savon &amp; Company of Port Said arrived in Bahrain on the 16th for consultations with the Bahrain Petroleum company. In an interview with the Political Agent Mr. Jones stated that his Company were anxious to obtain at least 50,000 tons of Bahrain M smalls'. He was concerned about the problem of moving such a large quantity of coke to Port Said and did not share the optimism of the Middle East authorities who had assured him that it will bo possible to arrange a programme of six days to load 6,000 tons in Bahrain, ten to twelve days for the journey to Port Said, and six days to offload at Port Said. After consultations with the Bahrain Petroleum company it is understood that Mr. Jones returned to Cairo convinced that although every one was only too willing to assist him and although ships might be obtainable the Oil Company pre-occupied as they were with 100 octane production and the shipment of cased oil could not give him any assistance to load the 'smalls'. Nor were Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company able to make any offer with regard to the provision of barges, &amp;c. as their _ organisation is extremely busy with the work at Ras Tanurah in addition to their Bahrain commitments. 227. Weather Heavy rain during the period under review resulted in the Muharraq aerodrome being u nserviceefole for a number of days and due to rain at Charjah^the landing ground was ,still unuscable on the 31st of December. 228.

Qatar Affairs For the first time for eight years a representative of the Shaikh of Bahrain has visited Qatar. Abdulla bin jabar, a trusted servant of His Highness, left during the first two ; or three days of December for Qatar bearing letters from His Highness to Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim A1 Thani, C.I.E. The representative was well received and His Highness is parti cularly pleased with the conversations v/hich took place between his representative and the Shaikh of Qatar. As a result of the.report of Abdullah bin Jabar His Highness 1 outlook towards the Shaikh of Qatar has much improved and he remarked recently to the Adviser that he would be heartily thankful when the Zubara question was finally settled as it appeared to be as resilient as a tennis ball and that he was very tired of the whole affair. His Highness is not alone in this. Trucial coast (i) On the 12th Captain R.E.R. Bird, Political Officer, Trucial Coast, accompanied a Royal Air Force party to Abu Dhabi where they propose to enlarge and improve the existing landing facilities. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, returned to Sharjah on the 13th. (ii) On the 30th of November a 75-mile an hour gale did considerable damage to house property at Sharjah where 1-|- inches of rain in twenty minutes did nothing to improve the living conditions of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. Three sailing boats in the Sharjah creek were sunk and one of the crew was drowned. Casualties have already occurred at,kb. Ajman where fishing crafts were sunk. Thefts of Royal Air Force ammunition On the 7th Flight Lieutenant Frankland, D.A.P.M. from Habbaniyah, called on che Political Agent in connection /with/ 218 . - 215. i with the theft of 2,000 rounds of R.A.F* ammunition ±. from the Royal Air Force Lines at Sharjah, Flight Lieu tenant Frankland was in fact more concerned about the theft of 30,000 rounds of R.A.F. ammunition here,which he had had that day reported to him. It seems that this ammunition was stolen from the R.A.F. magazine at Maharraq and indications are that the Levies are seriously involved in the aheft. Todate the civil police have been able to recover 8,000 rounds which include 1,000 rounds of revolver ammunition. it is strongly suspected that the major portion of the ammunition has already gone overseas and agents’ reports from Qatar indicate that possibly 7,000 to 8,000 rounds are secreted at Rueis and A1 Khor. The Shaikh of Qatar has been asked to co-operate in our endeavours to recover the ammunition and the Political Agent has sent a special messenger.to Qatar to consult with the Shaikh and is also having enquiries made through confidential channels. i Q^cj-l i ties for civilian families from the United Kingdom. Unlike the wives of officials of the Government of India the wives of employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company do not appear to be encountering any very serious obstacles to their leaving England for the East. Sixteen ladies have already arrived in Cairo from the United Kingdom. Two of these ladies are accompanying their husbands who are coming out to Bahrain for the first time. it was not until they reached Port Saj.d that transport difficulties were encountered but the situation has somewhat eased and quite a number are expected to arrive in Bahrain in the near future. 216. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) On the 12th three American employees of the Berchtel McCone corporation, having consumed a quantity of spirituous liquor, paid a visit to Manama town. They assaulted several beggars who were annoying them and later took refuge from the crowd which had collected in a local coffee shop. The Military Police from Awali were on their way to Manama to* deal with the situation when Mr. q.A. Rodstrom,.the local representative of the Arabian American Oil Company, succeeded in persuading the men to leave the coffee shop where they were then engaged in throwing pieces of furniture at various members of the crowd and return to the Oil Company’s premises at Awala,. The following day the men were dismissed by the Company for cause and left Bahrain by air. (ii) The Drum Plant. Preparations are now being made to ship a maximum of 44,000 drums a month of high octane fuel from Bahrain. The loading and stevedoring is being done by the military autho rities who are sending petroleum experts with 300 Indian troops to cope with the situation. At the moment however 'the plant for making the drums is not working satisfactorilv as could be expected as it is only turning out 18,000 drums a month. Additional machinery is however on the way and it is hoped before long to increase the production to the required figure of 44,000. 217.

Movements of Officials On the 26th the Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey prior, K.C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf accompanied by Mr. R.M. Hadow, I.C.S., and Mr. J* Croning, I.S.O., M.B.E., Under Secretary to the Hon’ble the political Resident, left by the up mail steamer4 198. Visitors (i) His Highness the Maharaja of Kashmir passed through Bahrain by air on his way to North Africa on the 16th. He returned on the 24th. On his westbound journey the Assistant Political Agent presented the political Agent's compliments as the Political Agent was unable to be present himself owing to the expected arrival of Sir George Cunningham. His Highness declined to come ashore from thfc' flying boat preferring to pass his time during re-fuelling traversing the space between the islands in a launch. (ii) Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Al Khalifah, C.I.E*, left for his annual hawking excursion on the mainland on the 19th. He expects to be away on the western,bfcrders of Kuwait for appr*r *) ximately one month. He was accompanied by hfs nephews Shaikh \ . Ali and Shaikh Salman bin Mohammed and his son Shaikh Ahmed and a numerous retinue. (iii)- On the 18th Sir George Cunningham, K.C.S.I.? K. C. I.E. , O.B. E. , I.C.S., Governor, N.W.F.P., passed through Bahrain by air on hi£ return from visiting the Afridi battallion in Iraq. He was mfet at the landing ground by the Political Agent and the Assistant Political Agent and Dr. S.G. Mylrea, M.D., O.B.E., of the Arabian American Mission. £ (iv) On the 19th Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton, the Chairman of the Directors of the Bahrain Petroleum Company,* arrived by air from Cairo and on the 20th he called on the Political Agent and informed him that he w$s at present acting for the Arabian American Oil Company and had come out from the States with a party of experts to make a flying survey of the possible route that a pipeline from Arabia to the Mediterranean might take at some future date. The mission consisted of Messrs. B.E. Hull, Oscar Wolfe, C.M. Rosebrugh, H.H. Hall, Sidney Johnson, Captain Rumsey, and Mr. W.J. Lenahan. Mr. Hamilton later had a confer ence with the Hon’ble the political Resident and called again on the political Agent the following day to say farewell before leaving for Dhahran. At the second meeting he informed that he proposed to leave Dhahran the following day for Riyadh to interview His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud. He was then ’ returning to Dhahran by car and flying to Cairo where he expected to remain fir a few days before again visiting Bahrain* The mission having completed their work were expected to return to the United States,*2 * (v) On the 22nd Air Commodore Leonard Taylor, Air Commo dore J.W, Honour, and Group Captain J.W. Binge arrived in Bahrain for consultations regarding certain questions con- • cerning the landing ground at Maharraq and the acquisition of further small plots of land for various technical purposes. &gt; * . . (vi) On the 24th Mr. H.S. Bowlby, the Petroleum Division Representative at Baghdad, called on the Political Agent accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel H.T. Hewitt, M.C., the Station commander. Mr. Bowlby had come to Bahrain in con nection with the filling and shipping of high grade petrol in drums. The drum plant is now capable of working to capacity and the problem to be solved was how the loading of the drums was to be carried out and what arrangements could be made for storage* It is understood that it was hoped to deal with some 70,000 drums a month. Mr. Bowlby was accompanied by a considerable body #f experts and it is probable that the theory of the operation has now been agreed to. (vii) On the 26th the Earl of Munster acdompanied by Mrs. De Bathe arrived by air from India and left for Baghdad on the 27th. 199. Calls On the 19th the Political Agent called on His Highness the Shaikh at Raffa f#r. the purpose of introducing Captain M.P.O’C. Tandy the Assistant political Agent and allowing Mr. R.M. Hadow, I.C.S., an Opportunity to take leave of His Highness before his departure to take up his new appoint ment as vice consul., Bushire. 200. Social On the 21st the Political Agent gave a dinner party to entertain His Highness the Shaikh and in honour of the Amir Saud bin Abdur Rahman the brother of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud who was paying a visit to Bahrain for a medical treatment. 201. 'Id-ul-^dhah The 25th, 26th, and 27th were observed as public holidays it being the occasion of the ’Id-ul-Adhah. The Political Agent accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent made the customary calls on His Highness, his senior relatives and the leading members of the Moslem community on the first two days. The *Id was observed in a very quiet way and but f«r the appearance of large numbers of young men about the streets in remarkably clean clothes there was no outward sign that the principal Moslem festival of the year was being / observed. Security Office, Bahran. The Security Office has closed and the Security Officer Captain G. Campbell left for Iraq on the 26th. ^03. Attempted sabotage at t he Refinery On the 21st Of NoVcdibsr it wasireported to the political Agent- that a minor incident had occurred in the Refinery which was somewhat alarming owing to the apparent cause being an attempt at sabotage. The engine of a pump was being reconditioned in the Refinery and on being inspected prior to reassembling it was found that a quantity of sand had /been3 been introduced into the lubricating system and that a handful emery abrasive had been placed on the piston head in one of the cylinders. There seemedtto be two schools of thought with regard to the perpetrators if the outrage, the management of the Company holding the view that it was undoubtedly the work of the rather rough Persian element who had been recruited recently for semi-skilled labour, while the Security Officer took the view that the Persians would not be capable of the intelligence and forethought required nor did they know where to obtain the abrasive and that it was probably the work of a non-Asiatic. The Bahrain Petroleum Company's private police were investigating and the Security Officer was also giving / considerable attention to the matter. 1204. The Arabian American Oil company, Dhahran. Reference paragraph No* 194 of Intelligence Summary No.21 of 1944* On the 22nd the Assistant Political Agent, captain M^P.O^* Tandy, went to Dhahran to investigate the living tondi- tions, &amp;c., of the Indian ex-employees of the Arabian American Oil Company who were awaiting repatriation via Bahrain to India. The Assistant Pplitical Agent interviewed the men at Al Khobar and examined their accommodation which he considered adequate and did his best to persuade them to accept the very generous scale of rations which the Company are now prepared to give them with an additional cash payment of Re.l/*- a day for the purpose of buying meat and fish* However the men refused point blank to have anything to do with the Company or to be beholden in any way to the Company. On the Assistant Political Agent’s return on the 23rd he recommended that the Indians should be brought *ver to Bahrain as early as possible as they appeared to be gradually becoming mentally deranged and were suffering from a persecution complex. Accommodation was arranged for them in tents through the courtesy of the British Overseas Airways corporation and the men were brought over to Bahrain on the 30th. They are accepting the rations which are provided for them by the Arabian American Oil Company’s agents in Bahrain. 205. Cigarettes On the 27th Mr. S.A. Masood, the representative from India of the British American Tobacco company, had an interview with the Political Agent at which he discussed the difficulties which their agent here was experiencing. The Political Agent pointed out to Mr. Masood that the administration had had a great deal of trouble with Aujan the British American Tobacco Company’s agent and that he was very strongly suspected of having smuggled considerable quantities of cigarettes out of Bahrain, and that his private fortune had increased by several hundred per cent during the course of the last three years. Mr. Masood was concerned with regard to the quality of some 2^- million Wills’ cigarettes which he stated he was unable to sell locally and asked for an export permit. It was pointed out to him that export permits for quota goods cannot be granted and that his company had failed to import any cigarettes at all f«r several months and if export was permitted then the stocks of cigarettes in. Bahrain would be depleted to a very serious extent. He was requested to endeavour to keep his imports uptodate as the present conduct of the firm inclined one to the belief that they were keeping the islands short so that the inhabitants would be forced to buy the unsatisfactory brand which they had insisted on their agent importing. Mr. Masood raised the question of imports from America and he was told /thatl that his agent had not made any application for shipping space although due notice had been given. It was now regretted that the lists had been closed some weeks and that space could not be made available. 206. Qatar (i) Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim Al Thani, C.I.E., the Ruler of Qatar is nearly eighty years of age and has surrendered the greater part of his authority to his most important son, Shaikh Hamad. He has even handed over the seals of office to this son. I* As a result of investigations carried out by the Political Agent earlier in the year and more recently by Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzak the Residency Agent at Sharjah (reference paragraph No.183 of Intelligence Summary No.21 of 1944) and the perusal and examination of reports and petitions which have been received from time to time it has become only too clear that the political situation in Qatar is unsatisfactory. Shaikh Hamad has behaved in a very high-handed manner and has rendered himself objection able to the majority of his father’s subjects and of his own relatives with the result that the former have to a great extent left the country and the latter are only living in Qatar because they are dependent on the Ruler. There is no doubt that a percentage of the quota goods, in particular sugar and piecegoods, which have been allotted to Qatar have never found their way to the people for whom they were intended, and there is reason to suppose that some arms traffic has been taking place between Qatar and Persia. Measures £re under consideration to ensure that grain, piecegoods, &amp;c. , do ‘in fact reach the people for whom they are intended and Shaikh Hamad’s Connection with the arms traffic and the re-export of quota goods is being examined. (ii) It having been established that Abdullah bin Darwish and his brothers jrassim and Abdur Rahman have been actively engaged in re-exporting quota goods from Qatar and probably trafficking in arms the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has decided that the movements of these persons must be restricted. The political Agent has been instructed that they should not be granted travel documents and the Shaikhs of the Arab side of the Gulf and the British consular officers of the Persian side have been asked to co-operate in ensuring that the'Darwish brothers remain in Qatar. 207. Weather Towards the end of the month fairly heavy showers of rain fell and reports were received from Saudi Arabia of extensive rain all over Nejd. Later reports were also received from South Persia to the effect that heavy rain had fallen over large areas. This news is most welcome because it will mean that the livestock imports for next summer and winter are assured and should be sufficiently plentiful to bring the price down very considerably. Rain in the Bahrain Islands is unwelcome as it does no one any good and often causes serious damage to house property. 208.

He was accompanied by Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave his Adviser and appears to have been much impressed with what he saw. His uncle Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, C.I.E., was prevented from being present owing to a previous engagement and his other uncle Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa al Khalifah owing to a failing ' memory. (ii) Reference paragraph 171 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No. 19 of 1944. It is understood that the new Company Guard are anxious to introduce American police methods and to patrol the Refinery and Awali plant premises with rc*dio \ equipped cars. Neither radios nor cars are available nor i for that matter does the area to be covered justify such very / westernwestern methods. Ciii) It is understood that arrangements have now been made for a number of the families of British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to obtain passages from England to Bahrain. This has given considerable satisfac tion to the British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and their American colleagues are hoping that similar arrangements will be possible for their own families from the United States of America in the spring of next year. 181 .

Reference paragraph 175 of Intelligence Summary No. 19 of 1944. On the 26th 36 Indian employees of the Arabian American Oil Company arrived from Dhahran en route to India. According to the Indians the Oil Company failed to give them adequate provisions or accommodation and they stated that they were not prepared to work under those conditions whereupon it seems the Oil Company management interpreted this to mean a refusal to go to work and dismissed the men under Clause 12 of their Foreign Service agreements. It is anticipated that a further oO or 70 dismissed Indian employees will be arriving at Bahrain as sDon as the local representative of the Company has been alble to find transport to India for the individuals who have already arrived here. The Protector of Emigrants at Bombay has been informed of the position and he has asked the Political Agent Bahrain to intervene with a view to obtainin / resonable4 rmt- , % i 183. 184. 185. reasonable conditions for the men and to inducing them to remain at work. Coke Shipments It is understood that it is hoped to be able to commence bulk loading of coke for Port Said early in January of next year. Meat Shortage Reference paragraph 145 of Intelligence Summary No. 16 of 1944. There have been further shortages of meat during the period under review and the Bahrain Government have at last accepted the advice of the Political Agency and announced their intention of killing only on four days a week. The general public will now be aware of when meat will be available and will also have the satisfaction of knowing that on these days there will be ample meat for everyone. Police Although under strength the Bahrain Government have agreed to undertake the guarding of the Royal Navy ! s Wireless Trans mitting station at Jufair. This has been done as the only alternative appeared to be for the Royal Navy to import a number of ex-Iraq levies at rate? which were nearly 100 per cent higher than those now being paid to the local police force. 186 .

Unfortunately the vessel containing the stores, cooking pots, stove tops, &amp;c., for the Company failed to complete her journey according to schedule and now rests somewhere in the Gulf of Aden with the aforesaid utensils. The result has been that the Company were unable to carry out their undertaking and the Indians have announced their intention.ol returning immediately .to India. The Company consulted the Political Agent Bahrain who advised them to arrange transport ation for those men who desired to return to India but stated that they should not be sent to Bahrain until satisfactory onward trans port had been arranged as shortness of accommodation and food locally would not permit of their making a prolonged stay. / 176 .176.

'Id-ul-Fitr On the 17th it was learnt that the temporal and spiritual authorities in Bahrain were in dispute over the actual day on which the ’Id should be celebrated. The ^adis maintained that the moon must be seen by the requisite number of witnesses while His Highness the Shaikh declared that the 'Id should take place on the 18th as both their Majesties of Saudi Arabia and Egypt had decided to hold the ’Id on that date. The state of suspense became more acute as sunset came and the moon failed to appear. The Qadis were distinctly pleased whereas the Shaikh with a tele gram from Ibn Saud In his pocket signifying that the, ’Id vc uld be on the 18th was seriously annoyed. About 11 p.m. the crow of a small dhow arrived and swore roundly that they had seen the moon when they were some five miles from the coast off Bahrain.

One of the American officers was killed and the other persons involved suffered slight injuries, His Highness was himself almost the first on the spot and personally directed the extrication of the dead officer from under the car. The police enquiry which was held the next morning indicated clearly that the deceased officer was solely to blame for the accident. 165.

The parpose of the visit was to make a super ficial survey in order to determine the likelihood of artesian water being probable at Sharjah.

It the request of the Political Agent, Captain G.

So far his enquiries tend to show that the Company are using their best endeavours to obtain labour aid that there* is no surplus labour. 155. Aircraft Mishaps (i) On the 15th a ’Warwick’ aircraft force landed on the Qatar peninsula some two miles*Inland from the west coast and approxi- m^tely in-line with the southern tip of Mananah Islo.nd.

Zubarah Reference paragraph 113 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1944. During the Ramadhan it is the pc esent Ruler’s custom to pay ^ d ^ r f? el Y e ? alls after sunset. On the 15th His Highness signi fied his desire to call on the Political Agent at 20 minutes past 9 p.m. end during the course of his visit of 3f hours he touched lightly on the q%estion of the Shaikh ef Qatar’s fort at Zubarah. The presence of this fort built a few ^ears ago and garrisoned by Qatari bedouins is somewhat galling to the A1 Khalifah. The hunting season is rapidly approaching and His Highness would like o go to Zubarah but he does not like the idea of doinf so under the eyes of the representatives of the Shaikh of Qatar. 'At the same time some of the younger members of the ,A1 Khalifah are again a'sking what they will get out of the pr esent agreement and pointing out that His Highness has treated Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah al Than! with the greatest cordiality and more than fulfilled his part of the , bargain. His.Highness would undoubtedly like the fort razed to the ground but it is of course most improbable that the Shaikh of Qatar s would ever agree to such a course. The Political Agent has in- formed His Highness that he will do his best to persuade the Sheikh of Qatar to withdraw the garrison from the fort and possibly to restore some of the arms which he acquired during the troubles of 1936. This could be done without the honour of the Bin Thani family being in any wsy affected and would satisfy His Highness giving him something concrete to shew to his hot headed relatives No reasonable man could object to this course of action but as the Political Agent so v/ell knows neither the Shaikh of Qatar nor his ^5^ re i rea ? onable men 30 is anticipated that there will be some difficulty in persuading him to agree to the arrangement. 157, Meteorological Maximum temperature Minimum temperature Maximum humidity Minimum humidity 99.4° cn 4th September 79,7° on 15th September 96 % cn 1st September 80 % on 4th September 20-9-44.

No meat appeared in the markets at all ^md sheep, goats, and steers, of which there had previously been a number in the Island, disappears into thin air. Unfortunately the Bahrain Government had no stock of animals themselves and as no imports were received for several days there was no meat available for the majority of the population.

Hamad Mn Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani left for Qatar on 10th August after recovering completely from the troubles with his teeth which.when he arrived in Bahrain over a month ago had put him in considerable pain and even danger. The Political Agent had previously called on Shaikh Hamad whilb he was still in the American Mission Hospital and found him making a good recovery. The call was returned at the Agency. The Shaikh enjoyed a well-attended departure, His Highness Shaikh Salman, and the other leading members of his family being present. The Politica . Agent also attended the send-off in impromptu fashion having just.. 1 3.andecl at the jetty from Sharjah by flying boat as His Highness 1 party arrived. The recently restored good relations between Bahrain and Qatar are apparently being cemented in cordial fashion. * 135. Supplies for Bahrain •v iru ?^ 6th i iU 5 Ust His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad iil Khalifah, k.C.I.E., called on the Political Agent to express his thanks to the agency and to the Hon»ble the Political Resident in i ?»n ersian tiie h e lp received in bringing in food and other essential supplies to Bahrain. His Highness said he. realised that ho was not entitled by any treaty to claim such • . ' ' Ar /assistanceassistance and consideration as he had enjoyed unless it be that the British in engaging to defend his territories night be held, to be obliged to defend then fron : the eneny of want, ' , He was therefore all the nore grateful for the readiness with which the needs of his people had been net. It is true that His Highnesses wont periodically to express his gratitude and regard for the British connection. But in admitting that as far as supplies and the effectiveness of controls was concerned his territory was in a more favoured position than perhaps a number of inflation-racked countries in the Middle Bast he appeared to be paying a sincere tribute. 1 In actual fact, for some months previously few supplies had reached Bahrain owing to the preoccupation of shipping with construction materials for the oil companies. But stocks were such that no acute shortages had developed and at the time of his visit His Highness was aware that the s.s. ,, Isnailia n carrying 2,678 tons of sugar, tea, piecegoods, and other commercial cargo was expected. 136. Food Control As usual before Ramadan, a meat shortage has recently been apparent, the probable cause being that butchers have been holding out for higher prices knowing that the public will pay any price lor meat during Ramadan. It was known that there were plenty of animals on the Island and it became clear that the butchers were restricting killing to keep up the price. On August 6th the Food Control Committee decided to remedy this position by adopting the following arrangementst- (1) All imports of livestock to be purchased by the Government acting through the Manamah municipality at prices agreed between the municipality and importers. (2) The municipality to retail meat at controlled rates, engaging •/. • . : for the purpose tv/enty qualified butchers on a monthly salary. (3) Importers not accepting the municipality rates to be at liberty to kill animals' themselves but to sell at con trolled rates. The measures have met with considerable success and meat is being regularly supplied at the following prices* Beef not exceeding Rs. 2-4-0 per ruba Mutton not exceeding Rs. 2-12- 0 per ruba Goat not exceeding Rs. 2- 8- 0 per ruba These prices are claimed to be 30% cheaper than prices before - ~ Ramadan last year and it is satisfactory that the position has improved before the festival begins. 137.. Fish. The Food Control Committee has also taken measures to tighten up control of the fish-sellers. Contractors and villagers had been selling outside the towns. With the help of the police, who have fined offenders in the Barbar and Sitra areas, the situation has improved and fish is coming in to the market in greater quantity. Large fresh fish are selling at Rs. 1-8-0 per ruba and small fish at Re.l/-. This is a slight increase in price but considerably more fish is coming in to the bazaar. The price for prawns and salted fish has gone down. 138. Dangerous dri ving • There has recently been an increase in road accidents. There have been three fatal accidents in the past four months /andi / 141 . 3 . and five in which serious injury has been caused. A number of traffic islands and electric light standards have been run into while the gpeed limits for various areas of the town have been widely disregarded. The root trouble is possibly the fact that the demand for drivers is such that some of the men being engager are often not competent (and, in some cases, not licensed) to drive light, not to speak of heavy, lorries. At the instance of the Bahrain Government, a letter is being issued by the Poli tical Agent to the services and the Bahrain Petroleum Company requesting that drivers be warned to exercise more care. The Political Agent has suggested to the Commandant of the State Police that the police should prosecute in all cases of dangerous driving. Offenders may expect not to be treated leniently in the courts. There is often difficulty in securing evidence. A mobile traffic patrol has been introduced, but this consists of only one motor cyclist. The police hope to increase the number of motor-cycle patrols. 139. Labour The labour situation has improved somewhat though both the largest employers of labour, the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Royal Air Force, still require coolie labour, the former in particular still being in need of about 2,500 men. However, the wage increases approved in the meeting of employers held in the Agency on 14th July have had some effect. The Bahrain Petroleum Company report that their coolie labour is up by about 12 % on their figures of men employed on July 1st and by 6 th August the number employed was 5,330.' The R.A.F. * report an. increase of about 100%, the numbers on 15th August being about 981. ' Efforts made by the Company to obtain labour from Persia have not been very successful. Inquiries made in Saudi Arabia also have not been Truitful.and it is thought that labour from this quarter will lot be available until after Ramadan. Inqui ries pursued in Iriq have met with no success. The Company have lately turned their attention to the . possibility of obtaining Italian labour. Italian internee Tt.-i is ^ labour from Egypt aas been considered unsuitable but inquiries are being made concerning a better type of Italian colonist labour in Eritrea vhich has already been successfully employed by the Americans there. The inquiries are exploratory at present and it has been pointed out that employment of the above labour would require to be approved by British Security authorities and the political authorities in the Gulf. The employment of. such labour, if in any number, would present both a policing (from the point of view of maintaining good order) and a security problem. 140. Incident at Sharjah A serious incident occurred at Sharjah on the night of 30th July. Three i merican personnel of the A.T.C. approached a barest! hut on the outskirts of tie towns and attempted to abduct a woman. The woman, as it aappened, was the mother-in- law of the brother of the Shaikh of Sharjah. As the woman cried out and attracted the attention of neighbours who came to her help the three men dropped her and made off in their vehicle 5 not before oi\e of them had broken the butt of the rifle of one of the Shaikh*s guards vho came to the spot. Great indignation was felt in Sharjah over this incident and there is little doubt that but for o'ir good relations with the Shaikh and his people the affair might have developed in very ugly fashion. It was unfortunately not possible to identify the men concerned but strict precautions have been taken against a possible repetition of th 3 incident. wf CUu ' . a-' jl u-iln incident occurred in Bahrain in the early nomine of 11th august* Four *nerleans assaulted and chased an H.C.O. and two nen of the Bahrain State Police in a certain quarter of the town, A nildly lunatic nenber of the crew of a tanker was put ashore fron a British tanker, the crew refusing to sail with him. Otherwise harmless, this individual displayed a tendency, somewhat dangerous in a tanker, to turn playfully the wrong taps and valves and to strike matches in inflammable quarters of the tanker. There was some discussion as to who was the authority responsible for looking after the man since there is no mental hospital in Bahrain. Finally, the Agency, the Bahrain State Hospital, and Gray, Mackenzie, the tanker's agents accepted a kind of joint responsibility. The man is being &gt; housed in the Fort and it is expected that a hospital ship will shortly be diverted to take him to Bombay en route to his home port Durban. 19-8-44 (Sd.,) T.E.

Port Secur ity Vide paragraph 126 (i?) above, Commander Sketch, accom panied by Captain.Go Campbell, Port Security Officer, Bahrain, called.on the Political Agent. He expressed himself as satisfied with the port security arrangements at Bahrain, remarking that Bahrain enjoyed two safety factors which made security arrangements less difficult, one the fact that Bahrain was an island and the other that ships unloaded at a consider able distance off shore. \ , ' ' ' • . Measures have recently been taken by the Stati on Comnande$. Lt.^Col. Hd. Hewitt. LI,Cl to prevent pilferage of War Depart ment cargoes. A system of guards to supervise loading at the ship and the passage of lighters from ship to shore has been introduced. The Director of Customs has set aside an area inside the pier shed for War Department cargoes. 128. Death of Ba hrain Petroleum Company employee bv uoi s onin r An Indian employee of the Bahrain Petrpleum Company died in the American Mission Hospital on 19th July. His death was diagnosed by Dr. Paul Harrison of the latter hospital as due to mercury poison!ag. The brother of the deceased had approach ed the Agency with a complaint that his brother had complained of severe pains after drinking medicine prescribed for him by the Indian doctor employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and made_up by a company compounder. The military doctor tempo- 3 V ari ‘t y appointed to take the place of the Agency doctor, Dr. M,LoA u Steele, now on leave, happened to be in the Assistant Political Agent ? s office when the man’s brother produced the medicine in question c The doctor tasted the medicine and remarked that it seemed extremely strong. Later he felt unwell and was obliged to take an emetic. The police are investigating. On analysis the medicine was found to contain mercury but it is not.yet established that the medicine drunk was as compounded. It is possible that the medicine was tampered with between leaving the d: spensary and the tine when it was drunk. A post mortem was carried out (apparently the first to take place in Bahrain^, and samples of the'deceased * s organs sent by air to Bombay f^ ~ me incident caused some excitement among the Inaian employees of the Oil Company. . 129. Bahrain Rad io A new Friday morning broadcast lasting from 10 a.m. to 12 noon has been introduced from 14th July.

The imports, v/hich consisted mainly of oil company construction material, were 8,390 tons for Bahrain and 1,016 tons for tran shipment to Saudi Arabia. At the end of the period under report two ships were still in port. 118. Movements of Officials (i) On the 9th Major T.

It is expected that he will shortly be able to leave the hospital. 120, Air Transport Security The Station Manager of the British Overseas Airways Corpo ration, Mr. H. L. Pointer, and the Senior Traffic Officer Mr. G.B. Gillibrand, called on the Political Agent on 12th July to discuss the question of tightening up security at the flying boat basis. There had been some pilfering at night from flying boats and information had been received that some mail bags had been slashed and mail stolen on the Cairo —— Karachi run. It v/as not thought that this had occurred at Bahrain but extra precautions (were desirable. The company had requested the R.A.F. Station Commander to supply guards but the latter had been unable to sassist. The Political Agent suggested that as far as petty pilfering was concerned, passengers could be told that no res ponsibility would be accepted for articles left overnight in the aircraft and that they should not leave articles behind. As to /the* kV’ti .'mV ■ ■3 . the supply of guards, the R.A.F. Station Q approached again, since it~ seemed clear that tl__ A lity was his, and if shortage of guards was the reason for his inability to assist, he should be requested to move higher authority, for the supply of extra guards. Meanwhile the company should station chaukidars on their planes 'day. and night. 2. Vide paragraph No,119(ii) above Squadron Leader Cramer when calling on the Political Agent discussed inter alia the legal side of a proposal to improve security arrangements in connection with the examination of air passengers. The Political Agent thought there would be no difficulty in the R.A.F. themselves taking over security arrangements but promised to discuss the matter with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and confirm. 121.

(iii) On the 24th Air Vice Marshal A.P. Davidson, C.B.E., arrived by air from Sharjah and left for Habbaniyah on the 25th. - (iv) On the 25th Commander Height of the U.S. Navy called on the Political Agent. Commander Height has recently arrived from the U.S.A. and has relieved Lieutenant Goddan. It is understood that Commander Height will be the Senior U.S. Naval Officer in Bahrain and will include Ras Tanurah in his area. (v) On the 26th Sir Olaf Caroe, K.C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and Sir Denis Pilditch, Secretary to the Government of India in the Home Department, passed through Bahrain from India en-route to Tehran. • (vi) On the 26th Shafkh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani arrived from Qatar for urgent medical treatment. Shaikh Hamad is the second and most important son of the Ruler of Qatar, and elaborate arrangements were made to welcome him. he has been /ni, / ill for some tine with inflannation of the guns which conbinec'. with chronic diabetes has had a serious effect on his genera? health. He was net on arrival by Dr. Storn of the American Arabian Mission, and Dr. Maroof Nasr a dental specialist. Later His Highness went in person to the end of the B.O.A.C. jetty to welcome Shaikh Hanad. He was then conveyed to His Highness’ house at Qadabiyah and a series of receptions connenced. Though they would no doubt have been pleasing to Shaikh Hamad in normal circumstances these formalities must have been excessively trying to one who was classed by the doctors as being ’’dangerously ill”. By the end of the period under review Shaikh Hamad’s health had greatly improved and though his treatment must necessarily be long and trying his recovery would appear to be certain. His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman has been extremely self-satisfied since Shaikh Hamad’s arrival and has been at pains to be embar rassingly polite to all people from Qatar. (vii) On the 29th Farid al Basrawi, Assistant to Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhal the Saudi Arabian representative, left for Riyadh and Jedda. Farid al Basrawi has been appointed as assistant to Izzat-ud-din Shawwa who it is understood has taken over certain of the duties originally carried out by Najib Salah. Farid al Basrawi was accompanied by Mr. F. J; Wakelin, Director of Edu cation Bahrain, who has been invited by the Saudi Arabian Govern ment to visit Riyadh on his way to Cairo for the summer recess. Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhal arrived in Bahrain on the 30th from Dammam. He informed the Political Agent that Farid al Basrawi has been relieved by Sami al Kutbi but that he, Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhal, proposed to make Bahrain his headquarters and leave Sami al Kutbi to deal with the affairs on the mainland. Reference paragraph No.31 of Intelligence Summary No .4 of 1 w/ j- ^ On the 30th Shaikh Hamad bin Said, the minor Shaikh of Kalba, left for Sharjah en-route to Kalba on his first school holidays. Shaikh Hamad settled down very well at school and his first tern nay be considered as a success. There is every reason to hope that he will return at the end of the holidays and will continue his studies in Bahrain. (x) On the 26th Mr. E.G. Bradey and Mr. Nels Anderson of the U.S. War Shipping Administration called on the Political Agent. These gentlemen were particularly interested in the welfare of American sailors in ships arriving in Bahrain. The Political Agent explained the position to them in detail and pointed out that as.there was only one more construction ship due'Bahrain was unlikely to interest them very much from the sailors’ point of yisw as in future practically all the ships calling here will be tankers. It was suggested that they should transfer their attention to Has Tanurah. £xi) On the 22nd Major Van Nostrund, Lieutenant Colonel Rutledge, Chief Engineer, A.T.C., and Lieutenant Colonel Addington, Wing Engineer U.S.A.T.C. from Casablanca accompanied by Major Cohen his Assistant, visited Bahrain and inspected the U.S.A.T.C, buildings w hich are being constructed by the Royal Air Force.

T he Berchtel McCone Parsons Corporation On the 17th an incident occurred at the main gate of the Bahrain Refinery. A B.M.P. employee endeavoured to enter the Refinery precincts without his pass. He was prevented from doing so by the sentries and as a result of a general misunder standing he, his five comrades, the sentries, and the Special Police guards appear to have become involved in a free fight. /TheBECHET ^ — No.11 of 1944 102 ♦ s hipping! ln-fcollige«e^ Q&amp;mib&amp;ry ^r£ Political Agency, Bahrain, for the period 1 st to 15th Juno 1944, -9- K ^ **** s ^ n *•' ft called at Bahriin (§0) n .

On the 1st of June the Political Agent presided at a meeting of the Senior Officers of the Services and the heads of the prin cipal business houses in Bahrain. The meeting was called to /! discuss the very serious shortage of labour and to consider means Jn by which the shortage could be remedied. It was generally^agreed » that all the employable labour was being employed and that it would be unwise to interfere with the economic life of the country by attempting to curtail further the number of persons engaged m ; this year 1 s pearling. It was decided to endeavour to recruit I labour from Iraq xr or Persia and it was understood that the [ B&amp;irain Government would probably raise no objection provided^ suitable guarantees were given with regard to rationing, housing, and the repatriation of 'foreign' labour. 106. K ing T s Birthday In accordance with instructions no ceremonies were held on King's Birthday on the 8 th but the flagstaff was decorated. General pleasure was evinced at the award to Dr. Paul W. Harrison of the American Arabian Mission by His Majesty the King of the Kaiser-i-tHind medal in Gold in recognition of his long and devoted service to the peoples of the Persian Gulf. Shipping Sp ce The shortage of shipping space has seriously affected the economic life of the Islands. Tea and sugar quotas have not come forwar i fr r, m India for some time and no steamer has ojt commercial cargo from India for 11§- weeks with the result that xhere is a general shortage of goods of every description in the town. Steamers have arrived from India during the above mentioned period but they have been loaded with thousands of tons of cement for the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and * , the Royal Air Force-building programme. 108.

A ircraft Mishaps (i) On tho 22nd a 1 Plying Fortress’ on a photographic recon naissance flight force-landed on the mainland opposite Yas Island. Four members of tho crew descended by parachute and were found the next morning some 49'miles to the east of the aircraft. Two of them were slightly injured while tho two members of the crew who remained with the aircraft escaped without any injuries. It is understood that the ’Flying Fortress’ is a total loss as it was landed on a part of the beach below high water mark and is therefore submerged twice in every twenty-four hours. (ii) Cn the 23rd a Royal Air Force machine landing near the r Flying Fortress 1, to rescue the two members of the crow was slightly damaged but will probably be able to be flown off after repairs have been carried out. xiii) On the same day (23rd May) a •Warwick’ aircraft had diffi culty with its landing gear and crashed at Bahrain. It is understood - that no one was hurt. Has Tanurah Refinery Cn the 24th the Political Agent accompanied by Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton the Chairman of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd. inspected the site of the proposed 50,000 barrel Refinery at Ras Tanurah. Construetionfhas already commenced on accommodation for the housing of the 1,230 Americans required for the actual construction work but owing to the nature of the ground progress has not been rapid. The houses are being built on concrete foundations laid on white sand-dunes. The sand is watered for some days before the concrete slabs are east in the hope that the sand will remain firm until the mixture has set. The Refinery itself will be built near the base of the penissula on low lying land of the salt marsh type. Very careful experiments have been and are still being carried out by foundation experts to deter mine exactly how the weight of the heavier Refinery buildings must be distributed. It is probable that concrete piles will be used fairly extensively passing through the soft elements of the ground and resting on sand stone formations well below the sur face. Except for machines moving sand hills and surveyors at work at the moment there is no sign of any building activity. The problem of discharging ships, the first of which is to arrive ,|farly next month, is most serious. So far Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company Bahrain have neither tho necessary tugs nor the barges. Tho haul from ship to shore will be quite a short one as the deep water anchorage appears to be only about 1^800 feet from the end of the peninsula. The small Refiner^ which is already in existence at Ras Tanura has just been restjt^p ted in order to provide motor spirit, &amp;c., for the construction program me. 89. Saudi Arabia While at A1 Khobar the Political Agent was entertained by Abdul-Aziz bin Abdul Aziz al Madhi the acting Governor of Qatif, while at Dammam by Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhal the Saudi-Arabian representative in Bahrain and with the Arabian Amerrcan Oil Com pany at Dhahran, and by Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz al Qassaibi at his garden at gafwah. While at Dammam tho Political Agent met the President and members of a Royal Commission who are investigating various. important problems in the Hasa-Qatif area. Huri-as-Sa*adawi, a native of Tripoli in Libya the President of the Commission has been in Saudi Government service for only six months prior to which he was resident in Syria for 31 years, in fact since the time he found it advisable to leave his native country owing to his dislike of Italian methods. The members of the Commission /were/95 were Shaikh. A-'dullah bin 1 Id an iron lie jd, Abdullah as Sa’ad from the Ilejaa, and Abdul V/ahab Aashi also from Ilejaz.

As a result of the tiyhteniny up of the restrictions on the export of pieceyoods, a movement initiated by this Apency, there lias been a«.n avera.e fall in pieceyoocis prices of approximately 30B. 92. Suspects Abdur Razzaah Khonji tl\e son of Ilaji Mohammed Tayib IHionji a leading merchant of Persian extraction has been permitted by the Bahrain Government to return to Bahrain. This youny man was at one time considered to be anti-British and his brother Abdul Hamid Khonji who will be returnin'- to Bahrain shortly was suspected of Japanese connections. Ilaji Mohammed Tayib Khonji has for some time been endeavouring to obtain permission for the return of his sons as he was finding it very difficult at his aye (he is over seventy) to continue his business activities and the Bahrain Government action in acceding to his request was largely influenced by the personal respect which His Iliyhness the Shaildi has for the old man himself. The C.I.C.I. have been Kept fully informed throuph Captain G.Campbell the local Security Officer. 93. Bai-hrain Education The Bahrain Government have decided to endeavour to obtain tutorial staff for cheir schools from Eyypt on the sane terms as the Kuwait Government did in 19d2. Mr. F.J.Walzelia the Director of Education will shortly be leaving; for Eyypt for the purpose of re* cruitiny the teachers and concludiny such arrangements as may be necessary v/ith the Egyptian Educational Department. Mr WaKelin while in Eyypt will endeavour to obtain technical instructors for the Technical School and if he is successful it will be possible to continue this very beneficial institution. At one period it seemed as if that shortaye of teaching staff and absence of raw materials for instructional purnoses would necessitate the closiny of the institution. Raw materials are still short but hope is entertained that the export of a small quantity will be possible from India. SC. Shiurine Sna ce.

On the 20th it w a s estimated that 400 tons of quota goods for Bahrain were waiting shipment in Bombay and Karachi and approximately the same tonnage for the Trucial Coast.

T1 police activities have momentarily checked, black market activities and. some of the more nervous dealers are reported, to have destroyed their stocks. 98. U.S.Maval Ob se rver s a t Bah rain. Commander Benkart tho A merican Maval Observer, Basra, in the course of conversation with the Political Apent said they were . considering the desirability of appointing an officer from his office in Basra to act as Assistant I ■aval Observer for Bahrain and Has Tanura. It is already difficult to understand what the three American naval Officers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company can find to do and there is no apparent necessity for the appointment of a fourth official. The number of American ships arriving here, other than tankers which are presumably dealt with by the U.S.nava l Officers attached to the Bahrain Petroleum Compa ny, is expected to decrease from no ,,T onwards as the major portion of the stores and construction material for the Refinery has already arrived-. u GO • Broadcasting , On the 16th a new feature was introduced on the Bahrain Broadcast whie’ took the form of interviews with important Arab visitors to Bahrain. ShaiU: Juma bin Maktoon the eldest brother of the Shaikh of Dubai was the first person to be intervievS. The broadcast was particularly well received as Shaikh Juma forpot that everything he said could be heard and some unintentionally amusiny ' asides cane ever the air. 100 .Labour. Labour difficulties increase day by day owiny to their beiny more and more demand for and less and less supply of able bodied men as unskilled workers. The demand is due to the expansion in the R.A.F. buildiny oro; ramine and the intensified work by the BerchtelwMcCone-Parsons Corporation who are constructiny the Refinery extension. The d inunit ion in supply is due to 52 Id men haviuy al~, ready left for tihe pearl banks and some further 2000 prepari.iy to do so in ’the near future. The recruitiny proyramme for labour for Has Tannra will shortly be openiny and it is now estimated that they will require 15,000 workmen for tbeir Refinery Construction and not *20,000 as was stated in para, ranh 72 of Intelliyeace Sum mary ilo. Ci of 1944. The question of restrietiny the movements of ' ' /manualmanual workers from Bahrain V/i 11 have to be seriously considered in the very near future. Although the difficulties are at present considerable it is worthy of note that they are only temporary for both the Refinery expansion v/or:: and the R.A.F. worh should be com- Dieted by the end of the year: \ 101 , Meteorological .

The party were en-route from Jedda to Ibn Baud's Camp near Hamah but were forced by bad visibility to come to Bahrain. On the 7th May, the weather having in the meantime improved, the party continued their journey to Saudi Arabia. His Highness the Shaikh paid a call on the Commander-in- Chief Middle East and Mr. Jordan at the Agency on Saturday the 6 th of May and entertained thorn to dinner the same evening.** (iii) On the 11th Mr. P^ttinson the General Manager of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company at Abadan arrived in Bahrain on a visit to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited.

Dnlrvmole Belprave. C.B.E., Adviser to His Highness the Shaikh' of Bahrain, paid a visit to the ruined town of Zubara on the west coast of the Qatar peninsula. The object f ^ hQ visit was to examine the limits of the ruined town and the ring of ancient forts which encircle the Zubara area. The ’ /partyI party noticed with interest that a large modern fort had been con structed by the Shaikh of Qatar in close proximity to the wells of i\l Murair.' * The fort was garrisoned by half a dozen bedouins^who were at first reluctant to permit the Political Agent.to survey /gentle the country from the roof of the building but later yielded to/per- snation. The party returned to Bahrain by launch the same evening. 78. Tru cial Coast On the 9th the Political Agent accompanied by the Residency Agent at Sharjah visited Has al Khaimah. After calling on the Shaikh he made a tour of the grain shops in the town and noted evidence of hoarding and smuggling. Later the whole matter was discussed at length with the Shaikh and the Political Agent m returned to Sharjah by car the same-evening. On the 10th the Political Agent.visited Shaikh Rashid bin Sa’ed at Dubai. Shaikh Rashid is acting for his father Shaikh Sa : ed Maktum, O.B.E., who is oh a visit to India. The same after noon the Political Agent visited Ajman and discussed various out standing matters.with the Shaikh who had that day returned from Manama. 79* B eni Oitab On the evening of the 8 th Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan the.para mount Shaikh of the Naim from the Baraimi—Dhank area, Shaikh Rashid bin Hamad the principal Shaikh of the.Al.Bu Shamis from the Baraimi area, and Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin the paramount Sheikh of the Beni Oitab called on the Political Agent at the Residency Agent’s house at Sharjah. They were accompanied by Shaikh Mohammed bin Saqr who is acting for his brother the Shaikh of Sharjah who is at present in India. The meeting was interesting and very amicable. Shaikh Mohammed bin Ali bin Huweidin has for the last ten years consistently refused to go anywhere near Sharjah although the Shaikh of Sharjah is reported from a reliable source to have offered up to P'.80,000 as an induce ment to him to pay a short visit. Now that contact.has been made with this elusive but powerful bedouin shaikh there is every.pros pect of improved relation with a people who can, if they desire and they often do, be most tiresome. 80. Pearl Trade It is probable that the pearl dive this year from Bahrain, Sharjah, and Dubai will be on a much reduced scale. This is due to the absence of rice and the difficulty of cooking wheat and baking bread in small overcrowded sailing vessels and also to a v' certain extent to the demand for unskilled labour at all these three places. It is probable that the numbers taking part in the dive from other parts of the Trucial Coast and Qatar may be much the same as‘usual but their range will be restricted as.the absence rice will necessitate frequent returns to port for re-victualling. 81. Shipping Space ^ . Great difficulty is being experienced by local merchants 1 1 both in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast in exporting quota goods from India. Once the quota has been granted and export licence U tWobtained they have then to search for shipping space. Many com- AdJ'fr plaints have been received from exporters of all kinds of goods fN ' aV that their merchandise has been waiting for weeks and still no \ space is available. The situation is not likely to improve in near future unless more steamers can be made available for the advent of the inonsoon will very much restrict the movements of • K sailing crafts in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. Dj &gt; , U*. ^ ^ U ^ p2 , Hoarding and Profiteering ltJ 1 The difficulty of obtaining shipping space .for pieeegoods from India has resulted in considerable speculation in the local % /piecegoods tv *-' 1 !u&gt;&gt; 3. piecogoods market* Piecegcoda have been changing hands bcrt^- weon merchants at fantastic prices and many merfhants who have previously never dealt in piecogoods have made large purchases and are reported to be holding against an anticipated rise in prices. The general public appear unwilling to complain against individinL merchants for profiteering and the authori ties are therefore finding it very difficult to deal with the situation. Regulations are being prepared which will make holding of pieeegoods by non-recognized dealers in that com modity in excess of household requirements an.offence and action will be taken to search suspected premises. 83.

Aircraft Mishaps g o o • m 39 rtf c-» K J ft X Two Anson 1 aircraft belonging to the Anti-Locust Mission forco- jlanded at Yas Island en-route from Sharjah to Bahrain on the 22 nd. There was a good deal of excitement as the crews of the planes were 'disturbed at what they thought was the hostile attitude of the local inhabitants. In point of fact the local inhabitants were not hostile Rut frightened and on overcoming their fear made the usual Bedouin demands for money and^firearms. Letters addressed to the local in habitants by the Political Agent was dropped late in the afternoon of.the 23rd and although the crews of the f Ansons f are stated to have said that they had no effect the fact remains that no further alarmist signals were received and the airmen were provided with a bag of flovr and a bag of peas by the 'hostild natives''. Unfortunately on the24th a serious mishap recurred with a petrol fire and one man was very seriously burnt. A B.O.’h.Co flying beat landed at Yas Island I and the injured were evacuated to Bahrain. As a result of the efforts of an engineering party which went down by sea to Yas Island the aircraft were flown off and arrived in Bahrain on the 26th. 69 • Boom i n land prices in Bahrain Some of the Bahrain merchants have undoubtedly done very well financially during the past two cr three years and as these same merchants are afraid that the value of the rupee currency will dete riorate after the war they are purchasing land. In conseouence land values have risen very considerably. During the period under review a small parcel of land which changed hands three years ago ✓ for P .2,000/- was recently purchased by Mr. Khalid Aujan the agent for the British-American Tobacco Company for F^.70,000/-. 70. The Bahrain Petroleum CompanyLimited There has been mild agitalJ-on among the unskilled labour _ employed by the Bahrain Petroleifti Company for free transprrtation between their houses and their work. The Political Agent has taken the matter up with the Oil Company and it has been agreed that the men : s demands are to a certain amount justified as the cost of bus y fares have risen considerably. The Bahrain Petroleum Company nnd. the Bahrain Government are making combined endeavours to find suffi cient transport to carry Manama and Maharraq workmen.to.and from the Company’s premises at Awali. Unfortunately it is impossible ,to take immediate action as no transport will be available until the Bahrain Government’s lorries arrive from India and the vehicles promised by the Persian Gulf Service Command to the Bahrain Petroleum Company are forthcoming. 71.

(iv) On .the 24th Major General Connolly of the U.S. Army arrived for a brief visit lasting only three hours.

The Bahrain Pe troleu m Company Limitec 1 Mr, S.D- Bechtel of the Bechtel McCone Parsons Corporation arrived from the United States on the 25th in the comparatively, sho-t time of 7 clays two of which were scent in Cairo. Mr,Bechtel accompanied by Mr. L. 11, Hamilton Chairman of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and Mr, Andreson the Chief hnyineer of the aforesaid Company lef ; for Tehran on the 30th for consultations with Major General Connolly of the Persia and Iraq Command. Mr. Bechtel appeared to be satisfied with the progress beiny made by his Corporation in the construction of the Refinery extension and y/as. optimistic about the completion of the work within the specified period. d4. Mess rs. Gray M a cken z ie &amp; Co.^ Ltd, Mr. J.M. Campbell the Manayer of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie £ Co., lei': for Iraq en route to the United Kinrdom on the 25th. There^ is some doubt whether Mr, Campbell will return to the Persian Gulf as his service of more than 30 years in the Persian Gulf area has seriously impaired his health, 45.

The Ar a bian Am erican Oil Co mpany —(Late California Arabian Standard Oil Company.) /n sutra 1 i\ r It has been learnt that drilling has stopped at the Arabian AAmerican Oil Company f s experimental well at Abrak~alrMabrit to the south of the Kuwait—Saudi Arabia^zone. It is understood that as no traces of oil were discovered after a depth of 10,400 feet had he Company decided to abandon the experiment and the al-rKabrit is reported to have been closed down. reached. Abrax* Duriny the period under review locustB appeared in Bahrain . Very luckily they did practically no damage and after a stay of two or three days disappeared in a southerly direction. Appeals^ were made to the Anti-Locust Mission but much to the surprise of the local inhabitants a reply was received to the effect that the Anti- Locust Mission were unable to deal with adult locusts. It seems that they can only take effective action against the creatures in an immature state as eygs or hoppers. 2, Exp )rt Permits from I ndia At the weekly Commercial Advisory Committee meeting at the Agency on the 27th certain of the members alleged that established shippers in India were selling the actual export permits to the highest bidder. There were also complaints that merchants in India who prior to the war were the agents for business houses in Bahrain having now become 'established shippers' are refusing to do business with their old principals on the same terms. They are insisting on Bahrain business men acting as their agents and Bahrain merchants are forced to acquiesce or to cease trading in that particular line, 'f. Slave Traffic It was‘reported to the Political Agent that Said al Kas'cr, Abdullah bin Ohanira&gt; and Suleiman Heidi persons who have previously taken a leading mart in the slave traffic had arrived in Buraini from Saudi Arabia. In order to refresh the memories of the Irucial Shaikhs with xegard to their undertakings the Political Agent thought /fit3 @ 3. fit to afdress a letter to each of then on the subject of Slave Trade and warned then to tale steps to exclude the aforesaid gentlemen iron their domains. 50, /■* Saudi Rials Although the export of Saudi Rials is forbidden from Saudi Arabia they are beinp brourht into Bahrain in considerable numbers and lurin'; the last 15 days the Ayency has been ashed to yrant export permits for exactly 100,000 rials. Accordin' to the policy at present being followed — a policy which it is understood is in accordance with the views of His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah — no export oermits have been granted. This does not mean that the rials will necessarily remain in Bahrain but it does mean that the enterprising Kuwaitis who are the principal dealers in this commo dity will find it more troublesome to export their goods to Kuwait. 51, Bahrain Broadcasts On the 220th a trial broadcast was made by the Public Relations Bureau on a new wave length on a much more powerful transmitter than that previously in use. The results of the trial were extremely satisfactory except on the Trucial Coast where apparently the broad cast was never heard. Application has been made through the Ministry of Information in Cairo for permission to introduce regu lar broadcasts on the new wave length and it is hope,, that it ’./ill not be long before the nightly programme is put over on the new transmitter. The broadcasting studio is being redesigned with a view to eliminating echo and the slightly microphonia effect caused by an unusually thin connecting; wall- . It is hoped that recording, equipment will shortly be available from Cairo and the programme will thus be vastly improved by the introduction of items of unrely inter-Gulf interest. 52, Interruption _of_. Gables is ^ovJ It has been reported that cable communication between Bahrain and Fao has again been interrupted and that telegrams for Iraq will be forwarded by wireless to Bushire and then by cable to Kao. rr ”&gt; OO • Wrech of a Kuwait 'Boom”. On the 30th a severe storm started and the wind blew conti nuously at gale force for 42 hours. On the 31st a dhow belonging to Haji Ahmed A1 Ghanim of Kuwait and captained by Saad al Kitami started several seams due to the high sea running and was beached by her captain in order to save the lives of the crew on a sandbarf: 2 0 miles north of Bahrain. The captain and crew were brought off the follov/ing day by a small vessel and it is hoped that the major portion of the cargo which consists of dates and date stones will be salvaged. It is even possible that the dhow itself can be repaired. The action of the captain in beaching his vessel is commended locally as had he endeavoured to made Bahrain it is cer tain that the dhow would have sun. 1 : and more than probable that the lives of the crew would have been lost. 54. Meteorological During the period under review the v/eather changed for the worse and high temperatures were recorded with considerable humidity. The highest temperatures were 91°F on the 16th and the 21 st . 5 while the humidity exceeded 015 on 6 days between the 16th and the 31st. ( 8 c.) T. HICiaiTBOTIIAIJ SKM . 3-4-44.

This attempt to educate one of the sons of the Trucial Shaikhs is a ery much of an euncriment and it is doubtful whether it will be successful. The boy is very unused to discipline, has never been away from home before, and within a short time of his arrival was berinnin; to wish himself back in Kalba. 32. Smur.rlinr Reference oara r raoh Ho .8 of Intelli 'once nna] Ho.i of ]£‘14 The proceedings have nor been concluded in the arms smuyrliny case and various interesting points have come to liyht. It is strongly suspected that immediately prior to the attempt to smuggle arms and ammunition out of Bahrain, an attempt which was success fully frustrated by the local police, some 16 motor tyres and a. , quantity of oiocepoods were smuggled out and sent to Kuwait. The men who were caught in the recent case have been convicted and they were undoubtedly members of a big yang of smugglers who worked in a large way. One of the Maharraq Naturs was in the pay of the smugglers and was among the persons convicted at the trial, Abdul- £-xtlah al-Ammari the son of - a well known pearl merchant of Maharraq was sentenced to 8 months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of f#fc.2,000/-. The Hatur was sentenced to one year’s rigorous impri sonment, and the owner of the house which was used as a base and a meeting place was sentenced to si:: months rigorous imprisonment. /Goods4 4 (222291 Wt.25796/P.113 5,000 9/42 A.&amp; E.W.LU1.

The construction of buildings for the U.S.A.T.C. is proceeding very well in Bahrain but has been held up at Sharjah owing: to a shortage of n guss' and coral rock. The 'juss' problem was solved on the Political Agent’s recent visit tc the Trucial Coast but the speed, of delivery of coral rock depends on the calmness of the sea and that is in the hands of God. , The transfer of No.244 Squadron from Sharjah to Masirah has been postponed until after the 1st of April owing to the lack of accommodation at present at Masirah. Tne Squadron is in the process of being rearmed with 'Wellingtons” to the satisfaction of the men and the peace of mind of travellers. 23. Broadcasting The permission of Messrs.

Campbell the Manager of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Limited. Mr. Eagleton was made aware of the extreme poverty of the majority of the inhabitants of the Trucial Coamt and Bahrain and said that he would do his utmost to obtain a reduction in the price of the white flour with which we had recently been supplied. It was pointed out to Mr. Eagleton that this parti- cular flour was objectionable both on account of its high cost and also because proper facilities did not exist for the making of bread from flour of such high quality. It was.agreed that Bahrain would endeavour to absorb 200 tons and the Trucial Coast 400 tons of high grade flour a month until such time as the present surplus had been ; worked off.

On the 11th of January the Chief Local Representative of &gt;the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and the Political Agent, examined in detail a list of grievances which had been put forward by the strikers. As has been previously reported the more important grievances had already been recognized and adjusted by the Company but there remained a number of minor points which required consideration. 7. Rent Control On the 2nd January the Bahrain Government, under pressure from the Political Agency, produced a Rent Control Order which not only controlled future increases in rent but legislated for a reduction in the existing rates for dwelling houses to what they were two months earlier. The Order also required all leases /toto be in writing and defined the causes for which leases could be terminated by landlords, 8 * Smuggling of Arms &gt; On the 15th of January the Bahrain Police arrested certain Bahrain subjects who were suspected of smuggling and found them in possession of five rifles, four revolvers, and approximately 300 rounds of ammunition.

' ~ 2^1 e The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited ' ( 1 ) Labour Strike Qn December 23rd a number of men employed in the Refinery of the Bahrain Petroleum Company struck work. The following lay more men from the Refinery joined the strikers and during the next two or three days men employed at Sitra unloading Refinery -construction equipment, and in the Transport Department ceased work. At one time there were rather more than 600 men on strike. The Refinery was able to carry on due to the fact that a certain number of men remained at their work and volunteers were rapidly forthcoming from the English and American employees in other departments of the Com pany’s operations. • . The workmen made no specific complaint to the Company or to His Highness the Shaikh or to the Political Agent before going out on strike and it was not until the afternoon of the 24th that any demand was put forward in writing by the men. It was unfortunate that the workmen decided to strike just when they lid because the question of their pay had been under lis- cussion for some time between the Agency and the Company and sanc tion for the increases which the; Company desired to make was received from their Directors on the 25th of December. If the men had only . made a demand before leaving their work or had waited another 48 hours a great deal of trouble would have been saved. There was close co-operation between the Agency, the Bahrain Government, and the Bahrain Petroleum Company and endeavours were made to bring the strike to a rapid termination. As a result of these endeavours the men had all returned to work on the 31st of December and the situation was normal on the 1st of January 1944. Some of the men’s grievances which were recognized by the Company as being justified have already been adjusted and the others are being examined by the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and the Political Agent. (ii) Fire. On the 24th the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s cinema caught fire and was burnt down. The financial loss to the Company amounts to approximately 80,000 Dollars. This f:fre had no connection whatsoever with the strike which was in progress at the time as it • was undoubtedly caused by a short in the illuminations of the Christmas Tree which had been decorated the evening before. 262. The Trucial Coast. A fine of Fs.7,000 has been imposed on Mohammed Faraiduni a resident of Dubai by the Shaikh of Dubai for smuggling sugar from Dubai to the Persian Coast. The fine will be used to reduce the price of cereals s -Id to the poorer elements of the town. 263. Obituary On the 26th the mother of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifah, an uncle of His Highness, died at Moharraq. The old lady was the wife of Shaikh Isa His Highness’ grandfather and a person of con siderable ability. She was at one time considered to be anti- British in her sympathies and was undoubtedly ill-disposed towards the Adviser Mr. C.D. Belgrave, C.B.E. In her later years she seems to have decided that both the British and the Adviser were not as black as she had previously imagined and died at the age of nearly a hundred pre-British and on excellent terms with the Bahrain Government. She was in full possession of her faculties to.the last. The Political Agent paid the usual call of condolence on Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa immediately after the burial./ /250.

After the investiture the Hon'bio Sir Geoffrey Prior K.C.I.B., hold a reception at the Agency for T&gt;ho British and American community. 249. Social (i) On the 11th of December His Highness gave a toodost dinner party in honour of the Resident to v/hich were invited the most representative gathering that has boon seen in Bahrain for some considerable time. Owing to the extreme shortness of supplies the party was not pn such a lavish scale as in previous * y o sr s. (ii) On the 9th the Hcn'hle Sir Geoffrey Prior K.0.1.13., paid an un-official call on His Highness at Raa'fa and disc ug£v&lt; 1 the general supply position in the Gulf with particular refer ence to Bahrain. !250 -71 • 1 u!UQhuh£i. The ^Id was celebrated on the 7 th and 8 th and the Political Agent accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent and the Under Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf paid the usual calls on the leading chants in the morning and on His Highness on the afternoon of the 7th* 251. Merchants Advisory Committee On the 11 th was held the first meeting of a small com mittee comprising representatives of all interests of the mercantile community. The Political Agent has asked these gentlemen to meet him once a week with a view to mutual dis cussion of trading and shipping problems. The Bahrain Govern ment is represented at those meetings by the Director of Customs. 252. Basrah Dates Reference paragraph 241 of Intelligence Summary No*22 of 1943. *■' The dates position has not improved. The Bahrain Governments agent in Basrah has reported that the price of dates is rising in ohe Basrah area and that even Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Comxjany are encountering difficulty in making purchases. It must be emphasised that Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Company are making these purchases on their own account, according to information available here, and not to supply the Persian Gulf quota. Information received fru/i various sources makes the outlook unsatisfactory for it is stated that at the end of this month the ban on the export of dates by rail from Khor- ramshahr will be raised and that the present average monthly freight of 500 tons will b&lt;j increased to two to three thousand tons a m^nth . This will naturally cause an immediate rise in the price of dates in Persia with a corresponding rise in the price of the Basrah dates. F oud Supplies Reference paragraph 242 of Intelligence Summary No.22 of 1943. The cereal stocks in Bahrain for practical purposes censed to exist on the 1st of December and up to the 15th of this month there was no indication when further supplies would arrive. Most fortunately there were in Bahrain some 1*250 tons of wheat destined for Uastern Saudi Arabia which has been retained and is being issued to the Bahrain Govern ment* If this wheat had not been present in the Island there is no doubt that the population of 95,000 persons would h 'vo had to live on a diet of dates and fish. Severe criti cism is heard daily with regard to those responsible for providing Bahrain with cereals. This criticism comes from nil classes of society. 254. T he Trucial Coast. The Political Agent arrived at Sharjah on the 13th and after discussion with Wing Commander Rethram, Commanding the Royal Air Force, called on Shaikh Sultan bin Saqor al Oasimi the Shaikh of Sharjah. On'the 14th the Political Agent visited Dubai and colled wn Shaikh Said bin Maktoom, O.3.D., and later attended a meeting of the leading merchants of Dubai /The3 liio meetrjng was convened to examine the possibility of I rationing piecegoods and to hear any representations that 1.03 merchants might wish to make. The system of established r vippers Cor piecegoods was severely criticised. The mer chants complained that shippers in India insisted on shipping co. their own account which meant considerable loss of profit to the Do.baimcrchants. They also complained that Ihcport Trade Controllers were not permitting the full quota of piecegoocs to be shipped as they regulated individual.shipper*s quotas by the average amounts that these shippers had exported annually prior to the introduction of the quota system and the aggregate of these average annual exports did not necessarily amount to the full quota for the Trucial Coast as the esta blished £ lippers were not the only merchants engaged in ex porting piecegoods prior to the introduction of the quota system. The Political .Agent undertook to represent the mer- community’s difficulties to the proper authorities. Tna same afternoon the Political Agent paid calls on Shaikh Kvalid bin Ahmed al Oasrni, Regent of Kalba, and Shaikh Ali bin Rashid al Naim who is representing his father the Shaikh of Aiman at present in India. On the 15th the Political Agent proposed no visit Ras al Khaimah but as the track had been rendered jxtremely difficult by 3 ^ inches of rain which fell in 14 hours on the 11th and caused considerable damage to the Royal Air Force Camp including the collapse of the Royal Air Force hospital, he was unable to get to Ras al Khaimah in the time at hms disposal and visited the Shaikh of Um-al-Quwain instead. On the 16th the Political Agent dined with the Shaikh of Sharjah. There are general complaints all over the Trucial Coast about the scarcity of piecegoods and the unsatisfactory diet which the unsatisfactory arrangements made by the Middle Fast Supply Centre has necessitated. There is general -conster nation at the introduction of white flour at a price which I fear will be considerably beyond the means of the majority of th o population. 255, Monoprolopical Max'.mum temperature 79-»6°F on 3rd December.

Andrew deir &amp; Company of Basrah, ’gents for the Bahrain Government and the Trucial Sheikhdoms .are finding it impossible to purchase in the Basrah market at what they understood was to be the fixed price of I. ).40 a K-ra and they complain that Messrs, .ndrew „eir &amp; Company arc charging them I.D.24-500 a Kara as commission and doing nothing in return lor the money. The view on the Trucial Coast is that Messrs. Andrew «.eir &amp; Company’s charges are. insisted upon by Lis Majesty’s Government to raise money to buy aeroplanes with. Jfhis is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. It iwS doubtful V/hether Basrah ’Dates can be sold on the 'Trucial Coast Per less M ft Is tnah S-i, 16/6/- n basket, a price in excess of last year’s, and /oneI r .* one \ hich v ill str;:in tho financial rosourcos of the poor to the utmost limits. 2^2 , I ? ood Supplies The food supply situation is extremely serious. Unless the raddle ^ast dupply Centre can.make further stocks of cereals available within the first tvo or three days of decemb r ;Lhc Island’s cereal resources \/ill be exhausted. fortunately, the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have a small stock of wheat destined for lias tarn daudi Arabia, lying with Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company and should the necessity aris^ this will have to be made available to feed the copu la tionas an alternative to starvation. The Middle Cast Supply Centre have announced that owing to the non-arrival of wheat stocks they will be forced to issue white flour -- very unwelcome news to the people. Having been weaned from their rice diet they have now accustomed themselves to cooking wheat in various forms and have no desire to start learning new culinary methods necessitnt d by the issue of flour. The cost of the flour, which wo must accept as the only alternative to hunger, is nearly 50 per cent higher than it was in March this year. Thu very high price of the now.flour has not yet boon made known to the people but it is easy to forecast their reaction — dismay.* 2a3. r atar The Political Agent’s visit to ■■‘atar referred lo in paragraph 236 (iii) above was to discuss various outstand-v ing problems and to enable the Political Agent to renew his acquaintance with the Shaikh Abdullah Jassim al Thani, C.I.3., and his interesting son Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah. Shaikh abdullah was at v'ajhba some 70 miles east of the small port qf 2 ekrit and the Political '‘.gent lunched with him before going to make a tour of the markets of Sohah with ca view to seeing the stock position in the shops. The almost complete absence of pieccgoods and the very high prices for who few inferior articles of sale was most noticeable. While in JJohah the political .agent had the opportunity of meeting the leading merchants and Government officials at tho house of ialim bin Mana the general fac totum of the dhaikh. They are an interesting body of men. 244.

The Political Agent was informed on the 23rd that 1,000 baskets of dates had been removed by Ibn Saud’s orders from Qatif to Jubail. The reason for this action is said to be that the tribesmen for whom dates are intended dislike visiting Oatif. 223. Saudi Rials During the period under review, 167,000 Saudi Rials • have been*exported from Bahrain to Kuwait. It is said that they are being purchased in Kuwait for re-sale to pilgrims. The control of the export of Saudi Rials from Bahrain is being considered by the Political Agency and the Bahrain Government. 224. E ducation in Bahrain. Although considerable strides have been made in increa sing educational facilities in both Manama and Moharraq, so great is the interest now being shown in education that on the schools re-opening the accommodation was found to be inadequate Mothers realize that educated daughters have better prospects in the marriage market and fathers that educated sons earn more money.

Dates It is reported that Ibn Saud is considering the transfer of all dates at Katif to Jubail. The Bahrain Government have fixed the price of local dates at Rs.7/- to Rs.9/- a basket.

A few hours after his. arrival came a telegram announcing that he is to leave Bahrain forthwith to take up the post of Head of an Arab Centre shortly to be opened in the Middle East for training young officers.

Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to His Highness the Shaikh, returned by air from two months f leave in India on September 19th. .99, Ramadhan Shaikha Latifa, wife of His Highness the. Shaikh, gave it as her opinion to Mrs. Belgrave that the majority of people in Bahrain did not keep the fast this year. . ?? G an accurate estimate, but it is at least a sign of the titrk.s.

On September 20th Mr. E.N, Chase, the Station Superintendent at Sharjah arrived in Bahrain to change places with Mr. C.N. Dalton, his opposite number here. 202. Economic (i) Reference paragraph 164 (i) of Intelligence Sum mary No.15 of 1943 which reported a meat shortage in Bahrain during the first part of August. The shortage continues as no meat at all has been imported into Bahrain during the past fortnight. This is thought to be due partly to a long period of continuous north wind and partly to Ramadhan. A substantial quantity of livestock is now 'on 'order ' 1 from Persia. (ii) The price of milch cows and of bulls for slaughter in Bahrain is nov; in the region of Rs.420 and Rs.300 per animal respectively, as against the normal pre-war price of about Rs.80 each. Many milch cows are now being slaughtered owing to the scarcity of bran and - date-stones, their normal forms of sustenance. Substantial quantities of bot£ have/-recently been ordered from Iraq. 203. S audi Arabian Visiters (i) Reference paragraph 133 (iv) of the Intelligence Summary for the second half of June (No.12 of 1943), which reported the arrival in Bahrain and subsequent departure to India of the Amirs Mohammad and Mansoor, sons of His Majesty King Ibn Saud, with their considerable cortege. On Septem ber 30th both Princes returned to Bahrain. At.11.45 a.m. fAmir Mohammad landed at the Muharraq aerodrome in a R.A.F. Hudson aircraft, with three attendants, having flown from Karachi without a stop in just over five hours. an hour and a half later, Amir Manscor, accompanied by Dr.Rashid Mahmud Firawan and two other attendants, arrived.in.the west bound B.C.A.C. flying boat en route to Kaliaj it is belleven that he is suffering from consumption, as well as acute sphi- lis, and is going to the Lebanon for treatment. Both Princes we?4 met by His highness the Shaikh, the Adviser to His Highness and a large gathering vf the Hull ^ Family. Amir Mansoor re-embarked in the flying boat alter the normal stop at Blhrain; Amir Mohammad spent the ni^ht at Bahrain as the guest of His Highness and Dd/retSrning the following morning. The rest of the p..rty are reouiuj. b by sea. It is reported that the Princes’ party caused a consider able stir in Kashmir, which they visited early in August anu where 3 ^. Helgrave vAs at the time. . .fhey stated^ve hired two large houses, seven large house-bc. „ not or c4s for a month in Srinagar and to have paid Es.40,000 ^ advance for Mem.

A rumour is also current in Bahrain that the principal reason why the Amir Mansoor is going to the Lebanon is for treatment of a knife wound which he sustained during an affray in Bombay. (ii) On September 24th Abdul Mohsin bin Saud al Jalw^i son of the Amir of Hassa, arrived at Bahrain for treatment w at the Mission Hospital for general debility and anaemia. 204. Pan-Arabism (i) On September 26th there arrived from Saudi Arabia, without any previous intimation of their coming, the Egyptian Under Secretary of State for the Minister of the Interior and the First Secretary of the Egyptian Legation in Jedda. The former had been visiting Saudi Arabia as head of a Mission to Ibn Saud in connection with the Pan-Arab movement. They called on His Highness the Shaikh and left Bahrain on Septem ber 30th on the westbound flying boat which carried the Amir Mansoor (reference previous paragraph). (ii) On September 21st there were seen in censorship two letters from Abdullah bin Ali al Zaiyid. the Editor of the newspaper ,? A1 Bahrain', to which a previous reference was made in paragraph 38 of Intelligence Summary No.3 of 1943» They were addressed, in precisely similar terms, to the Ministers of Education of the Egyptian and Iraq Governments, and asked that four boys from Bahrain might be given free tuition at Egyptian and Iraqi schools respectively; it was stressed that the boys were diligent, healthy and of pure Arab stock. Abdullah al Zaiyid is the brother-in-law of Shaikh Mohammad bin Isa al Khalifah, uncle of His Highness the -Shaikh of Bahrain, who has been on a two months r visit to Egypt and is now on his way back, but, to what extent, if at all, these applications owe their inspiration to.Shaikh Mohammad s visit to Egypt is not known. They are unlikely to have been on behalf of members of the Ruling family and were in no way sponsored by His Highness the Shaikh. 205. Medical Dr. M.L.A• Steele, the Agency Surg # eon, had his appendix removed on September 18th at the Mission Hospital; + dr- understood that it was an acute one and was ou !A only just in time. He left hospital on September 25th and resumed duty on September 28th. 206. Bahrain Government Hospital During the months of July, August ’ 1 R British Service personnel to the numbers of 65, 75 am respectively were treated as in-patients at the Bahrain Government Hospital. Of the total, 95 serving in Bahrain and 63 were brought here from outside. During August and Septan her 57% and 33% of the patients respec tively mere victims of complaints directly ascribable - thehead i.e. prickly heat, heat exhaustion and boils. 207. The Bahrain Petroleum Comp any Limited (i) On September 24th the first^of the construction men for the Hefinery expansion arrived in a D -C-3 w ' re Cairo, having flown from the United States. Th/(ii) ornifi .Arabian Standard Oil Company. A few more have since arrived and ethers are reported to be in Cairo awaiting onward transport. (ii) The Compahy’s Labour Supervisor is shortly leaving for India to recruit about one hundred Indian artisans and cldrks on one year contracts for work in connection with the new expansion. (iii) The extension of the Company T s Refinery will involve a permanent increase of between 57 and 75 Staff (i.e. British and American) employees. The Company's New York Office, owing to the difficulty of obtaining men from other.parts of the Empire, had expressed its intention of recruiting 70 apprentice operators, machinists, boiler makers and power-plant operators in Canada and giving them three months t refinery training in the United States before sending them to Bahrain. The Bahrain Management are not in favour of this arrangement for two reasons. The first is that they would prefer to have a completely free hand in giving the good new jobs to old and tried men with sound refinery experience in Bahrain, rather than feel themselves in any way bound to share them among new men with no experi ence of local conditions and with what they consider to be an inadequate period of training in America. The second is that it has been their experience that Canadians normally come to Bahrain, not with a view to making their career with the Company, but in search of Sj years' experience to enable them,at the end of their first contract, to return.to Canada and qualify for good jobs there: only th^ee Canadians out of about 150 employed here since the formation of the Company have returned to Bahrain on a second contract. It is under stood that the Company's New York Office have now agreed with this view in principle. * Mr. A. Ayto, the Personnel Manager, one of the six British employees whose departure for.England on leave was reported in paragraph 168 of the Intelligence Summary for the second half of August, is endeavouring to recruit anything up to 50 men there and has reported pros- pedts to be favourable. The Caltex Office in Cape Town has started a special recruiting campaign in South Africa ana hopes to produce 25men.\, 208. Pearling out after kk their return. 209. Currency 210.

P ublic Opinion Tlic surrender of Italy has been received with widespread rejoicing, oven in quarters whose sympathies in the past have been pro-Nazi. Italy has always been loathed and desnised for the manner of her treatment of Moslems in North Africa, and it is the Bahrainis 1 sincere hope that she will be kept within her own boundaries after the war. They regard it,'with considerable satis faction, as poetic justice that the surrender should have taken place during Ramadhnn 5 it was in Par-r dhan three years ago that Bahrain was bombed. 186.

T ; o price of the i?

Bahrain is far from self-sufficient as regards dates end normally requires to import somewhat over half of its requirements Shiefly /•chiefly from Arnbir. r.ncl Iraq, ExportvS fron the forner have for some tine been prohibited, but infomation ha.s just oeen received that a quota of 4,500 tons of dates fron Iraq has oeen allocated to Bahrain, under a scheme whereby Iraqis crportaole k surplus of dates is to be purchased at fixed rates by Messrs* Andrew Weir &amp; Co*, acting' on behalf of the British Ministry of Food, for supply to. other consuning territories* It is hoped that the price will be no higher than that paid for Basra dates Last spring by the Bahrain Gov eminent, who are selling all qualities of those dates to the public at a. unifom price of Rs 13/6/- per basket of 84 lbs or As. 2 *r per lb. 'This price has involved a subsidy by the Bahrain Govern non t to the extent of fron Re. 1/6/0 per basket for the cheapest and nost con:ion variety up to nearly Rs 5.per basket for the nost expensive variety. (ii) Meat. The controlled price of neat has been increased during the period under report, partly owing to the higher price £ that have to be paid for neat on the hoof fron Persia, and partly to bring* hoarded stocks on to the market. The present prices are Rs 3/8 per ruba for mutton and Rs 3/- per ruba for neat. In view of the difficulties involved in obtaining livestock fron Persia, and in order to keep prices down as far as possible, it has been decided that the Manana Municipality shall be cons tituted the sole purchaser of all imported livestock, which they will then sell to butchers, for the consumption of the public, and contractors, for the consumption of the Services and the Bahrain Petroleum Company (reference paragraph 164(i) of Intelli gence Summary No. 15 of 1943). (iii) Fish. During the last part of August and the first part of September there has been an acute shortage of fish in the Bah rain bazaar. This is due principally to the migrations* of the fish into the cooler and deeper water to avoid the extreme heat that prevails inshore. In some of the outlying districts the sea is cooler than it is round the towns of Man am: a and Muharra.q, but transport difficulties make it impossible to bring in the fish fron there, a. contributory cause of the fish shortage was that Bahrain’s complete supplies of wire for fish-nets were found to have been cornered by a single merchant, who was demanding Rs 10 per bundle for the 1500 bundles in his possession. His stocks have now been taken over by the Food Controller and are being sold at Rs 2 per bundle. 189. Saudi Arabia Food Supplies (i) Cereals . Infomation here is to the effect that &gt;though cereals have been rationed in the district of Jubail for about five months &gt;they have not yet been rationed elsewhere in Ha.ssa. The rations at Jubail were fixed at half a bag of flour and half a bag of wheat for every ten persons and one bag of rice for every 17 persons per month. Tills gave a total cereal ration of a.bout 28 lbs per man per month, or 8 lbs more than the Bahrain ration. It now appears fron a recent order planed on the Ba.hra.in Printing Press for 100,000 ration cards (to be issued to reta.il- ers g? n ly? . no t to consumers,) — which the Press is unable to fulfil owing to lack of paper — that rationing is now to be more wide ly intro duc ed into Eastem Sa.udi Ara.bia.. Retailers are to be allowed 5% profit only and no retailer is to be supplied with more than 5 bags of each commodity a.t a. tine. It is not known what scale of nations ha.s been prescribed? the ration cards-mention flour and wheat only, so stocks of rice' ■ have presumably cone to an end. The prices a.t .which the Sa.udi Government are to sell to retailers are 35 rials per 65 kilos of wheat and one rial per kilo of flour. Thesethe equivalent, at the present rate of exchange, of As. 11/5 and Rs. V5/2 per' Kilo respectively, as compared with the Bahrain Government’s present selling nates of as. 4/8 and As. 7/2 respectively.- 4 - (ii) I&gt;.tes . It is reported tho.t tlie Saudi Government have fixed a naxinun price f$r dates of Hio,.ls 5 (fis 6 / 10 /-) per basket of 63 lbs, but that as they are plentiful, they can actually be bought for Rials 3-| per basket or the equivalent of about As. 1/3 per lb. The price of ’’rattabs' is said to be between As. 2 -and As. 6 per ruba (4 lbs), depending on quality. Bates are therefore to be bought in Saudi Arabia for half, or less than half, their price in Bahrain. 190. U.K.C.C.Sugar ^wind /final Reference paragraph 171 of Intelligence Sun nary I T o. 16 of 1943 which reported the arrival in Bahrain of 7000 tons of sugar for storage on behalf of the U.K.C.C. A dhow bringing 402 bags of this sugar ashore foundered during the night of the 4 th~ 5 th September, when its anchor dragged owing to the sudden uprising of the Shanal/and it hit a rock. 28S bags were salvaged , of which 33 were sound and 29 were completely valueless. The remaining 226 bags were too badly damaged to be kept and were sold by auction on the understanding that their export would be allowed. They fetched Ks 34,500, or an average of Ps 152/10/6 each, though their^average weight cprtbibly did not exceed 50 lbs. • Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) In April 1943 the Chinese Government indicated a desire to send four students to Bahrain for about a year's study of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's oil production methods, with a view to controlling the Kansa oil-fieId,where some half dozen wells drilled by the Chinese had been'running wild owing to the absence of the necessary technical knowledge, negotiations proceeded, and the Chungking authorities have shown greo.t keenness that their men should come here. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, however, are not at present anxious to have them, in view of the forthcoming expansion of. their operations and, among* other things, the con sequent housing difficulties. They have recently cabled to the _ Chinese National Resources Commission at Chungking accordingly. (ii) The Bahrain Petroleum Company are in need of some good garage mechanics. They normally recruit the great majority of their skilled mechanics from India, but owing to war-time indus trial expansion that country is no longer a good recruiting-ground... The Company are accordingly exploring the possibilities of obtain ing mechanics from Zanzibar or Nairobi, where there are Industrial Schools believed to be run by Government. They have had one excellent man from the School in Zanzibar on their staff for five years and would like to obtain upto six others like him. They would employ them in the first instance on a three-year centrant, with the probability of a farther contract for the same period after home leave, if they prove s at is facto ly, and would pay them from Hs 5 to Rs 7 per working day and a Rs 20/- per mensem war allowance. 192.

EC onomlc (i) For seme days during the early part of the period under report no meat was to be had in the Bahrain bazaars. This was due to cornering of the market by the contractors of the Army, Navy and R.A.F. and of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Steps have been taken to ensure that this does mot occur again, . A contributory cause has been a. falling-off in the rate of imports of livestock from neighbouring countries. The latter has also been one of the reasons for a recent increase in the price of milk from As. 3^ to As. 4 per lb* Another cause of this has been the rise in the price of date stones imported from Iraq, which are almost the only form of nourishment available for Bahrain cows and which new cost Hs 7 per raaund.

The nakhuda had provisioned himself with neither grass nor water for the goats and as a result only tan cf them reached Buhbain alive on August 6 th. Of these, two died that ** evening after their sale in Bahrain. 165* Shortage cf small coin s There is again an acute shortage of small coins in Bahrain# On August 1 st an Order V 7 as published by the Political Agent pro hibiting the hoarding of small coins and providing for the punish ment of offenders* a similar Order was passed by the Bahrain Governments Petvy shopkeepers are believe* to have been hoarding up small coins, though searches of a jtffew cf their shops by the Bahrain Police have not as yet brought anything to light. The chief culprits, however, are the tawashes, who go cut to the pearling banks to buy rearIs, and living-crews, who have been taking with them coins for eventual sale in °atif at a 20 per cent profit. They have now been forbidden to take out more than Es 5 worth af a time. 166. Pearls Many rumours are in circulation both in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast that the Government of India have placed restrict tions on the import cf pearls. It is said that no imports from the Trucial Coast are to be allowed at all and that imports from Bahrain are only to be allowed on production of a 'permit” from this Agency. A merchant is rumoured to have recently been fined Es 50 for bringing pearls into India from Bahrain without having first produced the necessary permit. This scare has caused a reduction of upwards of 205 in the price of pearls in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast, and it is commonly suspected here that it was engineered by the pearl merchants themselves in order to bring down the buying price of pearls. This suspicion is streng thened by the fact that, although the pearl merchants have been informed that if they are anxious about the situation in India, or have received definite news about the rdstrietions on the import of peer Is there, they should come and see the Political Agent so that he may make official one uiries from India, none of them has done so, 167. 5mu.:;ain,i On July 31st Rashid Zoy'ni. n of the 3r to Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Zayani, a prominent pearl merchant of Bahrain, was caught red-handed in an endeavour to smuggle 50 packets of M and B 693 out of Bahrain to Kuwait.

Meteorological The Bahrain climate has lived well up to its reputation during the period under report, and there were several days when conditions were little v/orse than those described in paragraoh /jthe 160(ii) oblast Summary. It was noted in that Summary that the figures recorded by the Bahrain Balloon Observatory on that par ticular day were not remarkable, and subseouent enouiries shew that the figures published in thoseSummaries may not have given an altogether adequate idea of the' rigours of the Bahrain climate. In the first place, the Balloon Observatory, from / are wh&amp;ihthey/sflnfs derived, is situated at some distance from the Centre of Manama, where conditions are at their worst. In the second, the percentages of humidity recorded by the Balloon Observatory are not maximum percentages but those registered at 7,30 a,m., by which time the sun has risen high in the heavens and dispelled a considerable quantity of the moisture in the air. The maximum humidity occurs at about 4 a.m., when the temperature is at its minimum, and at that hour in Bahrain it is seldom, if ever, below 90%? on August 9th it was 100%. as recorded by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, (ii) Maximum and minimum temperatures during the period under report are given below.

The Political Agent, accompanied by Sauadron Leader Chase (Air Liaison Officer) and Mr* Bertram Thomas (Public Relations Officer, Persian Gulf) called on the Amirs at the Shaikh r s Palace shortly after their arrival. The two Amirs, Shaikh Abdullah Suleiman, the doctor and four servants left Bahrain for Karachi at 6.0 a*m* on June 13th in a Lodestar aircraft provided by the R*A*F• At their departure a Guard of Honour composed of R.A.F.

Pearling ■— Competition among Bahrain pearl merchants to purchase pearls as they are brought in has kept*the local price at a high level. In India prices have somewhat declined, and the price of pe°rls in Bahrain is now 15G to 20S higher than it is in Bombay. The price of pearls in Bahrain is approximately twice what it was at the corresponding period of the*1942 season. The expanse of pro visioning diving boats is also, of course, very much higher than it was last year, and divers 1, profits are not expected to be large. 138. Bccnomic (i) Cereals Stocks a.re temporarily adequate. (ii) Tea Stocks of tea are exhausted as shipments expected from India have not arrived. (iii) Piecegcods The following is an extract from n report recently received by the Political Agent from Hr. Belarave, Adviser to the Bahrein Government ’’In the Bahrain villages today numbers of men wear nothing but old sacks and women both in towns and villages are in many cases compelled to keep to their houses because the clothes that they have are hot sufficient to cover their bouies« In the town of Hedd, which in recent years has become a pverty stricken place owing to the recline in the diving industry, the attendance of students at the Girls 1 Bchowl decreased noticeably during the last few months. When the reason for the decline in numbers was investigated it was found that many children could not con^ to school because thair clothes would not cover them decently. For the same reason, but to a leaser extent, there was a decrease in attendance at some of the other Girls 1 Bchools The schools /-school© cr^rnised a fund for buying cheap material to clotho many of the students from poor homos to enable them to con tinue attending schools* Daily in the Orderly Room at the Fort I am asked by Policemen f who are comparatively well paid, to help them to buy cheap cotton goods to clothe their families who, they say, cannot gc out because they have nothing but rags to wear* During recent months I have rnyself seen both men and women, con gregated at the village ration shops, whose clothes consist of old rags which are scarcely sufficient to cover their nakedness* The reason for this state of things is not always that the people have not the money to buy clothes • In many cases they would buy the material if it was available.” This distressing state of affairs, is caused primarily by / the recent drastic reduction in the quantity of cotton piecegocds imported from India, k contributory cause has also bien speculation in piecegoods by retail merchants, who have been buying and selling to each other. In order to control effectively the price of the cheaper, essential qualities of piecegoods, the Political Agent issued an Order on June 23rd limiting the profit v/hich wholesale -nd retail merchants may make cn such goods and forbidding retail merchants to sell to any one except the consumer. The Bahrain Government will also take ever from importers* for resale to the poor at a concession price, one-third of all imports of such goods. It is obvious that, unless stocks of cheap cotton cloth can be built up during the next few months, mortality among the poor will be very high during the winter months when under-nourished bodier, without the protection of clothing, will be wholly unable to withstand the cold. 139* B-rhrain Government Hospital During the month of June British Service personnel to the number cf 32 were treated as in-patients at the Bahrain Government Hospital.

Ke made a forced landing, in a raging dust storm, on the C.A.'S.C.C’s new aerodrome at Dhnhran. He took off again to return to Bahrain, but on the way an engine cut out and he was only just able to make the Bahrain aerodrome. 123. Dates.- Only six weeks now remain before the new date season. The stock of dates in the Island is sufficient to meet require ments during this period, and the coming date crop shows promise of being an excellent one. 124. Pearling.- The orice of pearls remains very high, and optimism ^ continues in spite of the fact that the harvest of pearls has so far been meagre owing to the prevalence of a high wind causing difficult diving conditions. 125. Saudi Arabia \ ^ ‘ ivsk (i&gt; Reference paragraph 112 of Intelligence Summary No. 10 of 1943 in which it was reported that the Saudi Governmentwere at last taking energetic action to prevent the illicit export of foodstuffs. Steps to enforce the embargo on the export of gold have also been taken, and Saudi subjects are unable to leave the country without permission from the local Amir. Recently the Police at Al Khobar received information that two Saudi nationals- 2 - { &gt;&amp; travelling to Bahrain in the Oil Company’s launch had taken out somo sovereigns with thorn* As the Saudi Government Customs laun ch was not available, the Saudi Police borrowed another launch from the Oil Company, pursued the first launch, caught it up, and removed the two smugglers with their gold* It is not knov/n what punishment was inflicted on the culprits* (ii) A few weeks ago Shaikh Abdul Bahman al Tubaiohi, Ibn Baud’s Chief Chamberlain* brought his wife to Bahrain for medical treatment. Included in the party was a young lady, heavily veiled, who was treated with considerable respect, but was never addressed or referred to by name. It is now generally believed that the young lady was an unmarried daughter of Ibn Baud's whom her father allowed to accompany his trusted Chamberlain to Bah rain on condition that her identity was kept strictly secret* This story is rendered the more plausible by the fact th»t the party brought over to Bahrain one of Ibn Baud's private cars which Abdul Rahman al Tubaishi would hardly have been lent solely for his own use* (iii) Dr. Harrison, of the American Mission Hospital, has for a long time been trying to obtain permission from Ibn Baud to establish r Hospital at Hnsa. At recent visits to Riyadh doctors from the American Mission have been so favourably received th;t Dr. Harrison thought the time was ripe for the fulfilment of his ambition, and he was able to persuade Bin Jaluwi, the Gover nor of Hasa, to write to the King recommending most strongly that permission be granted for the establishment of a Mission Hospital at Hofuf (HasaJ* It is understood that Ibn Baud’s advisers gave expression to different opinions about the advisability of open ing a hospital* but eventually conservative views prevailed, and Ibn Baud has written to Dr. Harrison informing him that it is at present impossible for a hospital to bo opened at Hasa* 126* Typhus Reference paragraph 101 of Intelligence Summary No. 9 of 1943. - One case of typhus has occurred in Bahrain. The patient was a Persian who had come in a dhow from Bandar Big. Symptoms of the disease only became apparent after he had been in Bahrain for somo days# 127* B ahrain Government Hosoital During the month of May British Service personnel to the number of 34 were treated as in-patients at the Bahrain Govern ment Hospital.

United Nations Day Stimulated by the infectious enthusiasm of Mr. Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer in the Persian Gulf, all commu nities in Bahrain combined to celebrate with eclat June 14th, United Nations Day.

Saudi Arabia The Saudi Government are at last taking practical steps to stop soine of the ^ abuses by which their customs administration in Hasa has, until recently, been characterised. Launches now patrol the coast and inspect out-going dhows to see that food stuffs are not being smuggled out of the country; and condign punishment has been meted out to certain Customs and Police officers who were proved (more or less) to have aided and abetted the activities of illicit exporters. The offenders are being marched from place to place and paraded in chains, with their faces blackened, and bearing a placard explaining the nature of their crimes. Their march, and probably their lives, will terminate in a dungeon at Hofuf• 113. Am erican interests Brigadier-General Patrick Hurley, President Roosevelt’s Personal Representative in the Middle Bast, arrived in Bahrain on.May 23rd in a United States Army aircraft »nd left for the mainland the following day. He v/as on his v/ay to Riyadh to see King Ibn Baud. 114, Currency (i) The price of sovereigns remained steady at Ps 62/- throughout the month of May. (ii) There are now almost no silver rupees left in Bahrain. Those that do remain are in the hands of pearl merchants, who require them for making purchases of pearls at the pearling banks, 115* Captured Italian guns for His Highness the Shaikh VUS _ Reference paragraph 35 of Intelligence Summary No. 3 of 1943 in which was reported the arrival at Bahrain of the two - Italian 105 m,m, field guns promised to the Shaikh of Bahrain oy His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester. On /-On Mf.y 18th sixteen shells v/ere fired from ench of the guns in the course of s demonstration organized for the benefit of His Highness the Shaikh by Colonel Hewitt, The demonstration, which was an unqualified success, took place at Rumaidha and ■^he Shaikh was able to view the proceedings from the top of a neighbouring watch tower. The Shaikh, who fired one of the guns himself, was impressed by the smartness of the gun crews and was also gratified at the excellent performance of the guns which fired at targets ranging from 2000 to 8000 yards* The Shaikh's only regret was that no photographer was present to obtain a pictorial record of his firing of the gun, 116, Bahrain Petroleum Company (i) Information has been received that a long-discussed project for the extension of the Bahrain Refinery has been given final sanction, and construction work is expected to begin in September. Between 300 and 500 American Construction experts will be engaged on the work and employment will be given to some 2000 or more Bahrainis, (ii) Mr, Ward P, Anderson, General Manager, has been summon ed to New York to discuss the new project, and hopes to leave Bahrain in the first week of June. During his absence, which is expected to be of 2 - 3 months 1 duration, Mr. Russell M, Brown, Manager Operations, will carry out the General Manager's duties. 117. Suspension of Exploratory Work by Oil Companies The Iraq Press has given publicity to the agreement reached by the Iraq Government with the Mosul Petroleum Company Limited and the Basrah Petroleum Company Limited. Under this agreement the Iraq Government is to be given by the Companies a loan of I.D, 1,500,000 free of interest in consideration of the government's allowing the Companies to suspend exploratory work until two years after the cessation of hostilities. The loan is to be repaid out of royalties accruing when exploration work has been resumed. If the terms of this agreement come to the notice of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar (as they almost certainly will) the Interests of the Oil Companies operating in their respective territories are likely to be adversely affected* 118.

He left after a stay of a week during which he discussed with the Political Agent a number of local issues. (iii) Shaikh Abdul Rahman al Tubaishi, King Ibn Saud r s Chamberlain, has arrived in Bahrain, bringing a sick relative for medical treatment. He paid a formal call on the Political Agent to whom he conveyed messages of greeting from the King. Mr. Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer, gave a party in his honour at which war films and news reels were shown. 98. S rc kaggLS. (i) The Political Agent was convalescent throughout the period under report, recovering from the effects of the medical treatment which he was given for dysentery during the previous month. (ii) Captain Tandy, Political 6fficer, Trucial Coast, has been admitted to the R.A.F. Hospital at Sharjah suffering a severe attack of malaria. Afterten years of uninterrupted good health he has succumbed, during his six weeks at Sharjah, to three successive maladies - oyster poisoning, tonsilitls, and, finally, malaria. 99. S ujc&amp;e Captain T.J. (^Donovan, Master of T.V. ,, Athelmonarch ,, , was brought ashore on the 12th May with a gunshot wound in the head. From the inquest held by the Assistant Political Agent it seems that the wound was self-inflicted. Captain 0 ponova died on the day of his arrival here and was buried at the Roman Catholic cemetery. 1QQ. Bahrain Government Hospital During April British Service personnel to the number of 21 were treated as in-patients in the Bahrain Government Hospital Amoebic dysentery was the commonest complaint. IQl. Typhuft ^ This disease is prevalent in Iraq and Persia, and Dr. Steele, in his capacity of Port Health Officer, is taking ener getic action to ensure that infected lice are not introduced into Bahrain on the persona of passengers or crew from down- Gulf steamers and dhows. It is said that typhus-carrying lice do not survive long in high temperatures, and there is reason to hope, therefore, that Bahrain will be spared this par* ticular form of infestation.102♦ Economic Ccnditio ns l ^) The Secretary of the Muharraq Municipality has reported that in the four months January to April over F.s 1000/- has been spent by the Municipality in providing winding sheets for pauper burials. This is approximately three times the normal expenditure The increase is believed by the Municipality to be due to ^more paupers, mere deaths and dearer winding sheets”# 103^ Bahrain Cer s us ar d Fo od Rationing It las been mentioned in previous Intelligence Summaries how useful the census taken in January 1941 has proved as a basis for the organization of a system of food rationing throughout the island. Comparison of census figures with ration card registers shows that the census was remarkably complete and accurate in regard to the total number of the population of Bahrain} but there is © very great discrepancy in the division of the popula tion into adults and infants. In 1941 a disproportionately large section of the population was entered as infants* in the ration card registers of 1943 a disproportionately large section has been entered as adults. The explanation is simple. In 1941 it was generally believed that the census was being undertaken as a preliminary to compulsory recruitment for military service, and a great many adults were deliberately and dishonestly report ed to be infants- In 1943, since children under 12 years of age - are only entitled to half the authorised food ration, exactly the reverse has happened, and many children under 12 years of age have been registered as adults. 104• Bahrain Po lice On the night of May 5th eight members of the police force stationed at the Manama Fort refused to go on duty as a protest against the Bahrain Government’s decision not to grant them a ”war allowance” such as has been given to other local Government employees to enable them to meet the increased cost^ of living. On the morning of May 6 th another* 40 or 45 men at the Fort handed in their uniforms and resignec from the Police service. The places of those who had resigned were at once filled by transfers of personnel from the locally recruited whose strength is in excess of current requirements. Thereafter no further trouble was experienced. The Bahrain Police are well paid and exceptionally well fed, and the unfortunate incident was caused by a stupid mis take on the part of the Adviser’s Secretary. The rates of the war allowance granted to Bahrain Government employees .who not in receipt of free rations have recently been revised, and the police clerk at the Fort inquired from the Adviser s sec retary whether police personnel would be entitled to^the allowance at the revised rates. The Adviser’s Secretary, in a moment of inexplicable aberration, replied in the affirmative. The police at the Fort (though not at other stations) were therefore led to expect an increase in pay, and when, on pay day, this increase did not materialise, the reaction caused by their disappointment was extremeo C*f.c**9*. , 'O I Ifz '•&gt; £*&lt;1 l flrr 105. Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to the Shaikh of Bahrain, who is &gt;mmandant of the State Police Force, and has built it up and irtured it with loving care, was deeply distresses at the ttitude adopted by so many of his men. He discove^n (t,o eote a character from Thackeray) _”How sharper than Doth It is to have a serpent child'. ed (to a thankless Tunisian V i ctorv Th&lt; success of Allied arms in North Africa has made a Iremendou impression on the Shaikhs and people of Bahra n.«■» 3 “ His Highness Shaikh Salman was also deeply impressed by the dignity, sincerity and simplicity both of His Majesty the King*s message to Mr. Winston Churchill and of the latter's reply. This exchange of messages on a historic occasion appealed to Shaikh Salman as being perfectly expressive of the relations which should ideally exisn between a great King and his trusted Prime Minister. 106• Bahrain Petroleum Company The General Manager of the iUiglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan recently addressed a circular to British employees saying that he had been trying to arrange passages for persons desiring to take leave in the United Kingdom, and asked addressees to put in their claims so that a 'Priority List' might be prepared. He took care to state that passages had not yet been officially authorised, and that applications were only being invited so that, if a few passages were authorised at some time in the future, there would be no delay in taking advantage of the concession. British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company soon neard about this circular, and the rumour went round that A.I.O.C. employees were being allowed home leave. Excitement was uncontrolled and jealousy intense. Steps were taken, as soon as the real contents of the A.I.C.C. circular had been ascertained, to give publicity to the true facts^ and indignant visitors to the Political Agent were told that, though no A.I.O.C. personnel had yet been allowed home leave, he sincere .y hoped they would be since this would strengthen the cla:.m of BAPCO personnel. The excitement has now died down, but the temporary stir is an index of the intensity of fee .ing which canbe generated on this subject if employees feel that they are not being given a square deal. It will not be possible to 'hold down' British employees, who are already jealous of the leave facili ties enjoyed by Americans and Canadians, if they are not given treatment at least equally favourab .e to that accorded to A.I.O.C. employees. 107.

Mean while, sufficient have arrived to permit the demands of the pearl ing fleet to bo satisfied in full. 'Z, r; T 1 31 o 3 : D S3 7n £3 S3 * f® ■ m (iii) Food distribution . It has taken many months of patient work to organize an officient system of food distribution through out the island# , The system is now working smoothly, but local arrangements have continually to be adjusted to meet local needs# For instance, there is a general migration at the beginning of the summer from towns and certain villages to coastal areas (a migration which was accelerated last year by fear of air raids - vide paragraph 61 (iii) of Intelligence Su mmary No# 8 of 1942), and it has been necessary to transfer the names of largo numbers of ration-card holders from one T supply area 1 to another one. Adjustment in the existing organization has also been rendered necessary in Manama, where it has been found that the issue of rations on a weekly or fortnightly basis does not meet the needs of very poor people who can only afford to purchase rations for a day or two at a time. Five shops have therefore been selected at which rations will be issued on a daily basis only# 92/-92. The Poarlin/Lfflcat During tho few d^ys of April poarling ernft h^-vo bomxn leaving Bahrairt for the pearling banks. The season has begun in a spirit of optimism which contrasts strongly with the atmosphere of gloom with which the prospects of the 'dive' were Envisaged only throe months ago by representative pearl merchants and nakhodas. The change of outlook is due to a number of causes» In the first place f it was realised several months ago by the Bahrain Government that unemployment and economic distress would be substantially relieved if pearling operations could be under taken on a large scale this year* They therefore took timely steps to give practical encouragement to owners of pearling boats and to all who finance diving operations. Diving fees for tho season were waived, and it was announced several weeks ago that provisions for tho pearling fleet would not have to be purchased in the open market but would be made available by the Bahrain Government in adequate quantity and at a concession price. To •this artificial stimulus to enterprise has been added encourage ment in tan unexpected form - the price of pearls has again risen owing to tho sustained demand from the Indian market* April was an anxious month for the Bahrain Government and also for tho Political Agent, who had suggested that they should adopt the policy described above* At the beginning of April the dates ordered from Basrah had still not arrived, and the stock of cereals in the island was insufficient to provide both for the pearling fleet and for the resident population. But the wheel of fortune then turned! several shipments of cereals arrived, and favourable winds brought the long-awaited dates from Basrah. No one in Bahrain except His Highness the Shaikh, tho Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Political Agent knew how near tho Bahrain Government was to failing in its undertaking to provide food for the pearling fleets and, since this knowledge was con fined to so few, public confidence remained unimpaired. Bations are being issued to the crews of pearling boats on the following scale :~ Rice 6i lbs per head per month Wheat l&amp;J lbs ” Dates 48 lbs ' ,f 93. The Shaikh of Qatar Shaikh Abdullah bin Oasim al Than!, C.I.S., Ruler of Qatar, has been seriously ill with gastric trouble. He was visited in the last week of April by Dr. Storm who reports that the Shaikh is now oenvaleecent. 94.

In order to eke out the rapidly dwindling supplies of rice in the island the public were also permitted to purchase wheat in lieu of the more expensive rice ration. Full advantage was taken of this concession , and poor people were enabled to buy, for the first time for many weeks, their full rati of cereals. All stocks of whent in thu island are hold by the Bahrain Goverrm ent., and it is On them that the cost of making this concession falls. The fine, white Australian flour which arrived on March 3 rd cannot be used for making 'khubz', the kind of bread eaten locally. It was found, however, as a result of experiment, that excellent 'khubz' can be made from this flour if it is mixed in equal proportions with coarsely ground wheat. There is, how ever, only one mill in Bahrain and the owner refused to grind wheat for less than the grossly excessive charge of Ks 5/- per bag. The Bahrain Government, therefore, in the public interest, took over the mill by executive order, and are now milling wheat to mix with the white flour. The resulting compound is being sold to the public at the concession rate of 3 annas per lb.

It was at the and of the summer. There was a dhow at anchor near where w&lt;- were bathing. Arabs came from thdhow in a small boat and caught us. They took us to the dhow and tied us up. It was in the afternoon. The Arabs in the boat took us to Qatar; we w^re about a month in the boat. We arrived at Dohah and for two days we were left in the boat. Then we were taken to the house of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim, who bought all of us. I heard later that I had been bought, for »s 300/-. I think that 1A 300/*- to 1,000/- was paid for the others as some of the boys wore older, about the age I am now. Abdulla bin Jasim gave me to his brother Th.' ni and I was his slave until I escaped from him ten days ago. I was sent out to the desert in the south of Qatar and I did not see the others again; I heard that some had be&lt;-&gt;n given away .-nd sent to Nejd. I became a camel boy in the house of Qhaikh Thani, brother of Abdulla bin Jasim. I was badly treated and beaten and I asked to bo sold to someone else but they would not sell me. I was often hungry. About ton days ago I ran nway from Shaikh Thani’s place, ,r 0m Maslan n , and came to DohaH. I heard that the Shaikh was deporting all the foreign poor people to Bahrain, Kuw-it end elsewhere. I joined the people who wore being sent away. Several boats were a^nt off with paupers and the fares and food were provided by Shaikh Abdulla-. I went on board the boat as it was leaving and nobody prevented me* I arrived at Bahrain and we were caught by the Police. I did not see uhe other boys from Makran because I was a long way cf£ in the desert* The girl is still in the house of Abdulla bin Jasim -nd her brother is uhoro too; both are younger than me. Shaikh Thani has about twenty slaves, men -nd women; some of them are light, some black; he has no others from Makran. About a year ago h-= bought throe now slaves, black ones; they wore sold to him by some Houlis from Persia* Their names arc 3a { edan, Perraj, Sulaiman. They are all grown up* They prefer being slaves in Th^ni’s house to belonging to the Persian Houlis. These three slaves were in the hands of the auctioneer in Dohah and wh«n thoy h^d re- chtsd their price the auctioneer inform ed the Shaikh and he bought them* Wo are given dates and a lebin° to eat at noon and rice with out fat for dinner. Twenty slaves are given one dish and the big ones eat all the food, so I was hungry. The men who h ve always been slaves do not mind because they become accustomed to being b^- ten but I was not a slave and have never become accustomed to this. Bin Thani himself beats the slaves with a stick and if he has not got a stick ho uses a stone. Last year I ran away and arrived at Dohah; I wanted to find a boat. The Amir was told that I had escaped and watched the boats so they caught me. I was taken back and kept many months - six months - a prisoner in a tent; then I v/as let out. I would like to go back to Makr^n# My father used to be a diver. I am his eldest son. There were no others.

This estimate assumes the arrival during March of a final shipment of rice from Calcutta. (ii) Dates Since the Iraq Government lifted their embargo on tne export of dates at the end of January rather more than 200 tons of dates have arrivec in Bahrain. A further 2000 tons is on order. The price of dates in Basrah, already very high, is reported to have risen by 20 % during the last fortnight, presumably as a result of the heavy demano icom Bahrain andpther Gulf Shaikhdoms. (iii) General Cerealf are rationed stringently and the price of dates, although controlled, is so high tnat poor people can only afford to buy them in smaj.l quantities. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the standard of health among the poorer classes of the community :s deteriorating rapidly. The old'and frail have been the first tc suffer - and the State Medical Officer has already reported a number of deaths among old people caused pri marily by malnutrition. Children of the poorer classes are also showing the effects of under-nourishment. A further indication of ^the the decline in^/economic welfare of the community is the steadily rising number of thefts ard ourglaries reported to the police. Local resources have been utilised to the utmost - but local resources, so far as foodstuffs are concerned, are limited to dates and fish and a negligible quantity of wheat. The whole of the date crop has been kept for human consumption, though in normal years dates are fed in large quantities to transport animals. A result of this diversion of food from animals to human beings is that donkeys also are suffering hardship. Not only have donkeys been deprived of their norma 1 nourishing food but, owing to the ever-increasing shortage of motor transport, they have had to carry heavier burdens for longer lours; and many of them are breaking down. The position in regard to fish is that demand exceeds supply. To satisfy the increased oerand it is necessary for fishermen to fish by night as well as ty day - and this they cannot do without an additional meal of dates.; which they cannot afford to buy. Relief Committees have been established which distribute food to specially deserving case?, and regional centres have been opened at which dates are sold by t.he Bahrain Government at cost price.

It hns now been decided to round off the work in hand and to undertake no further cons truction work. 51. Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) Reference paragraph 40 of Intelligence Summary No. 3 of 1943 in which it was reported that the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany had imported thirty head of cattle and sheep with which to start a livestock farm. The difficulties of providing suitable fodder in adequate quantity have been found insuperable. The animals have therefore been slaughtered and their carcases placed in cold storage. (ii) In paragraph 214oof Intelligence Summary No. 19 of 1942 reference v/as made to the feeling of unrest among British emp- 3oyees of the Company caused by their protracted detention in Bahrain without the opportunity of returning home. That feeling o:: unrest is not lessened by the circumstance that their American and Canadian fellow employees are still able to take home leave; end it is vastly aggravated by recent experience in regard to mails. Whereas mail from the American continent arrives with reasonable speed and regularity, letters from the British Isles arrive at irregular intervals after delays of many months* Many British employees of the Oil Company - like other British resi dents of Bahrain - have had no letters from England for three, four or even six months though they have correspondents who write regularly by air mail every week. This absence of contact with families and friends at home has on British employees of the Com pany an unsettling effect which the enervating climate of Bahrain renders all the more insidious and demoralising. 52. C alifornia Arabian Standard Oil Company Indian employees of the Company, though they are not sub ject to industrial conscription, have for several weeks been show ing signs of discontent. After having decided to stage a strike as a preliminary to presenting their demands to the Company^ management they learned that strikes are illegal in Saudi Arabia and that they would be arrested and put in gaol if uney carried out their intention. Nineteen of them therefore presented their demands without first going on strike. The demands, which relat ed to every aspect of the conditions of their employment, were couched in what the Company regarded as belligerent and offensive language; and the Management refused 3 r tn.ondider the petition unless it were rewritten in more temperate words. / a typical extract from the petition is !- M He was a true American who the other day so appropriately described this our bunkhouse as Cooly Bunkhouse No. 17 M __/ • The employees concerned refused to rewrite their petition; and, in protest against its rejection, resigned ' . :.n a body.

It is not yet known what action the remaining seventeen disaffected employees propose to take. 53.

Itali an ,ouns for His Highness the Shaikh When H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester visited Bahrain last summer he informed H.H. the Shaikh that His Majesty's Government proposed to present to him two captured Italian 105 m.m. field runs with 3.000 rounds of ammunition. The guns and ammunition,which were brought from Suez in a tanker, have now arrived and are being temporarily kept at Sitra* 26. Fo r v d Supplies (i) Dates . The Iraq Government’s action in lifting their embargo on the export of 'dates to the Persian Gulf has been of immediate and substantial benefit to the people of Bahrain. Local owners of date gardens, who had held up a proportion of their stccks in the hope of profiteering from the acute shortage of dates, ; at once put their remainin' stocks on the market and thus relieved the existing stringency. Local merchants have placed large orders for dates in Basrah, and the Bahrain Government, to ensure that supplies are adequate to last until the next crop, have ordered 500 tons of inferior quality dates from Iraq. Unless unexpected difficulties arise over shipping the position in regard to dates should now be secure for the current year, though the proolem of provisioning the pearling fleet has still to be solved (v5.de paragraph 37 below). (ii) Rice . Stocks are sufficient to last until the second half of March. A final shipment from Calcutta is expected but has not yet arrived. % (iii) Wheat and flour . Stocks are expected to last until the middle of May, but will, of course, be exhausted much sooner if stocks of rice cannot be replenished and wheat or flour has to be issued in place of rice. (’iv) General . H.H. the Shaikh, like every other responsible inhabitant of Bahrain, realises that supplies of cereals cannot „ Ibe /- '• 3 iu jbe obtained from any source except through the ^ood offices of His * Majesty’s Government, The Shaikh, thouyh naturally anxious about the future, ie, at the same time, relieved to feel that the res ponsibility for brin'itnz food to Bahrain no lonyer rests in any way with him or his administration but exclusively and unaryuably with the British Government. He has absolute confidence (a con fidence which somewhat illogically* is enhanced by the favour able turn which the war has taken) that the British Government ^ will provide wimely assistance in adequate measure. 37. Pear ls On 9th February the Adviser presided over the annual meeting of Nakhcdas and leaders of the diving industry. Discussion centred round the activities of the 1942 season and the prospects for the 1943 season. It was agreed that, from the point of viev; of Nakhodas and divers v last season had been an exceptionally bad one. Only a very smal.. proportion of the boats made profits, and most of the divers, as the reward of several months’ exacting labour, had merely inc-. y Teased the amount of their debts to their Nakhodas. This disappoint ing state of affairs was caused entirely by the greatly increased cost of provisioning the pearling fleet. Some time after the end of the diving season there was a sharp rise in the price of pearls owing to demand from India, but the benefit of this rise went mainly to pearl merchants wno had bought the season’s ’’catch'* at the lov;er price level previously existing. Nakhodas and divers derived no benefit from this rise, though the price which they got for their pearls when the season closed would have given them a profit in normal years when food costs were not so heavy. In regard to the coning season the Adviser warned the meeting that rice might not be available for the pearling fleet. The Nakho das, after discussion, agreed that, though it would be difficult to do so, they could carry on if adequate supplies of wheat and dates were availablec and they asked that the Bahrain Government should now purchase large stocks of dates to be set aside for sale to them y at trie beginning of the diving season. In regard to wheat, they, realised that v-verything depended on the quantity which the British Govevnm nt were able to send to the island. 38* Baud .

The Two delinquents, having been detained at Riyadh for some weeks, were released by Ibn Saud after the notables of Oatif had interceded on tdeir behalf and had given a pledge that they would refrain from similar objectionable activities in future. Shaikh Mansur and his son arrived back in Qatif on February 9th.* 39. Loca l A ffair s In the last week of January five orisoners made a dramatic escape from the. State Prison on Jida Island. On a night of violent storm, when se; tries could hear little save the raging of the gale and when, in ary case, they were likely to desert their posts for the shelter of the guard room, the five prisoners forced open the door of cheir c ell by means of an iron bar which they had smuggled in from the gacl kitchen. Four of the prisoners also managed, by means of the seme bar, to free themselves of their leg irons. They then went down to the shore, got into a small police sailing boat, and set sail fer the main island of Bahrain. When they had reached a point midway between the islands of Jida and Umm as Saba’an the boat capsized. Three of the prisoners struggled to Umm as Saba’an, but the other two (one of whom still had his leg irons on) were never seen again.

(BBB)Jdpneral:- The M.E.S.C. have accepted responsibility for applying Bahrain and ether Gulf Shaikhdoms with their future requirements of cereals, and it is hoped that during the rest of the year essential foodstuffs will be sufficient in quantity to meet the Island’s minimum requirements. The problem still to be solved, however, is that of making essential foodstuffs available a?fcrS ?o°nav community at a price which they can vill^Q present hundreds of families, mainly in the p c 'y^. no ^ 5 e 5 ns + J° makG purchases even up to the limit of v;hc ; t is allowed to them under the rationing system. Urgent consideration is being given to this problem, but in the . meantime economic conditions continue to deteriorate with alarm ing rapidity. Police reports show a steady increase in juvenile crime, and the offenders, when arraigned before a Court, plead that they were starving and beg to be sent to gaol where at least t 2 G y will be well fed. In almost every case the veracity of the offender’s plea is substantiated by his physical appearance. A r st,or y is t,old By the Bahrain Government's Chief Medical Officer who states that an increasingly large number of patients come to his hospital suffering from extreme debilitation caused by malnutrition, the only cure for such patients being food and rest. Fortunately the Bahrain Government have substantial funds at their disposal and it should be possible, either by opening up Relief Dorks or by making cheap bread available through subsi dies, to relieve if not to eliminate a good deal of the existing distress. 61 • Food Supplies - Saudi Arabia (i) During the Political Agent’s visit to the Saudi Arabian3 mainland he was informed that a census of stocks of cereals in East Arabia had recently been taken by Ibn Saud’s orders. This census disclosed that, apart from stocks belonging to the Saudi Government, there were 15000 bags of rice in Hofuf and 8000 bags in Ontif. -s ^ Orders had also been received from Ibn Snud controlling the selling price of rice and dates. Maximum prices were fixed as follows s~ Calcutta Hice .*• Bs 39/- per bag Karachi Rice l.» Fs 33/- per bag Dates «. • Fs 3/- per basket If merchants claimed that their stocks of rice had cost them more than the selling price now fixed, the Saudi Government would, on production of the merchants’ invoices, take over their stocks at the c.i«f. price and would place them on the market at the new controlled price. (ii) Much of the Canadian wheat which His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain gave on loan to the Saudi Government in October 1942 was not used for the purpose for which it was intended, i.e. the immediate relief of starvation, but was used as seed grain. The result has been unfortunate as the crop sown with this Canadian wheat seed has been a total failure. 62. B ahrain Petroleum Company From time to time fear has been expressed lest the short age of food in Bahrain should lead to deterioration in the effi ciency of the Oil Company’s operations. That this fear is not unfounded is indicated by the Company’s Annual Accident Report for 1942 in respect of Non Staff Personnel 1941 1942 Average number of employees ''excluding those engaged on P.A.D.work) 2021 1861 Frequency Rate (Injuries per million man hours worked) 19.2 22.14 Severity Rate (Days lost per thousand man hours) 0.57 3.59 Injury Index (Combination of Frequency and Severity Rates) 24.9 58.0 (Note:- The Frequency Rate indicates the frequency of acci dents without regard to the severity of any individual accident. The Severity Rate is an index of. the severity of the accidents which have occurred. The Injury Index takes into account both the frequency and severity of accidents, and is designed to give a representative picture of the progress - or lack of progress - being made in the promotion of safety measures)• During 1942 the Company paid greater attention than they have ever done before to ’’Safety Education” and accident preven tion. Their efforts were rewarded with success in the case of Staff Personnel (British, American and Canadian employees) whose Injury Index fell from a figure of 32,6 in 1941 to 8.1 in 1942. Other things being equal, the Injury Index for Non Staff Person nel should have followed the Same downward trendy and the Com pany have come to the conclusion that the only satisfactory explanation for the opposite trends in the Injury Indices of the two classes of personnel is that the decrease in efficiency and ’’awareness” of Non Staff Employees is caused by serious deterioration in their physical condition. 63. Bahrain Police The Bahrain Government have been offered by 2nd Indian Division, for the use of the 3t°te Police, 10,000 rounds of /-i r 4 - ~of .303 ball ammunition. The offer has been gratefully accepted. 64* Births and Deaths The Adviser to the Bahrain Government is urging His_Highness the Shaikh to introduce a system f^r the Begistration of Births ^and Deathsi A few years ago such a proposal would have caused excitement and alarm among the population; but the successful completion of a census in 1941 has hardened Bahrainis to adminis trative novelties, and the useful purposes served by the census, particularly in relation to food rationing, are now generally admitted throughout the Island. 65. Bahrain and Persia Bahrain has a resident population of over 1(3000 Persians, the majority of whom are engaged in petty trade. The closeness of their affinity to their mother country - or at least to their respective home towns - is illustrated by the fact that a Persian merchant domiciled in Bahrain, hearing that his heme town, Bastak, was suffering from famine, recently appealed for funds to relieve the distress prevailing there. Within a week mere than Rs 20,000 had been subscribed in response to his appeal, and contributions are stillc oming in. 66 . Persian Gulf Fighter Fund Rs. 2438 has been raised for the Fund by means of a Boxing Tournament held in February. Competitors came mainly from British 'military personnel stationed in Bahraio, but the Tournament was promoted and organized by two members of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Indian clerical establishment. 67.

On 26th January a Bisley aircraft made a forced landing on Jinnah Island, which is situated about 100 miles North-West of Bahrain, off the Saudi Arabian coast. The crew of three officers were uninjured and the machine escaped damage. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company sent prompt assistance. The problem of how to get the machine into'the air again is a-difficult one which has not yet been solved. 20. Royal Air Force Levies . . Hon. A.B. Hailey, son of Lord Hailey, who was an | officer of the Persian Gulf Levy Corps stationed at Sharjah, has been killed in a flying accident. 2 1 * B ahrain Government . Mr. de Grenier, Director of Customs, has gone to Baghdad for a few weeks’ leave. He has been in poor health for some time. r • 22. United States Aircraft.*• 23. Bahrain - Political and Economic. (i) Shortage of food has led to demonstrations in a number of villages, and signs of malnutrition are becoming increasingly apparent among children of the poorer classes of the community. The Bahraini's staple diet is fish, dates and rice. Fish is still obtainable in Bahrain, but there are no dates on the market and rice is expensive and strictly rationed. Tne island*Q annual date crop is only sufficient for four or five months’ consumption, and, owing to export restrictions in Iraq and Saudi -Arabia, Bahrain's usual external *• **• jut- sources of supply have been denied to her. Information has been received, however, that with effect from January 27th the Iraq Government have lifted their embargo on the export of dates to the Persian Gulf, and it should now be possible for Bahrain to obtain at least a portioh of its requirements ot dates. In regard to rice the outlook is black in the extreme. Bahrain has stocks of rice sufficient only for a few weeks, and the news that India is unable to export any more r ice to the Persian Gulf has come as a stunning blow to e y e ryone. Unless the British Government are able to bring supplier o rice or other cereals to Bahrain in the near future the population must starve. i (ii) Stocks of sugar are running low and it has not been possible to obtain fresh supplies from India. An enterprising local merchant (Dhamanmal Isardas) is trying to obtain a ship ment of sugar from Mozambique, but it is 1 eared that exchange control restrictions will render his efforts abortive. 24 Iraq, u The news that Iraq had declared v/ar on the Axis powers was cordially received in Bahrain, where it was taken, somewhat cynically perhaps, as evidence that Iraqis now regard ed their country as free from danger of invasion. It cannot be said, however, that Iraq's declaration or war nas had a y considerable effect on local opinion, which looks ior a lead to Ibn Saud rather than to Iraq or any other Arab country. 25, Saudi Arabia. Information has been received that the use of currency notes on the mainland has been prohibits , an t^y no longer, even nt a discount, be tendered in pnyment for goods. 26. Currency . The flow of Indian currency notes from Bahrain to Kuwait has been so continuous, and so great ^ wlume^ th-.t it has become necessary to control it. In luture indr_ currency notes may not be exported from Bnhrai ^ Der _ of more than Rs. 1000 at any one time w ^ h °rantod P whlre the mit. Permits will, of course, always ^ g^ntod where tne export of notes is required to finance any bon r . lid transaction. 27. Petroleum Concessions Ltd . The Company is having an argument with the bn^i of Abu Dhabi about the interpretation of a cl'^ye in the Oil Agreement which is eatable of being read in two ways. The Shaikh claims that no'is entitled to payment of a sum oi -ro* i 25 000 in January 1943 while the Company admit his iSoO only. . The argument has boon conducted without acerbity on either side. 2 &amp;.

The news that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain h d been made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire was received with deep satisfaction by the recipient himself, and with pride and gratification by other members of the A1 Khalifah. Defence Officer, Persian Gulf (i) Lieutenant-Colonel H.T. Hewitt, M.C., received the news of his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on New Years Day. Cii) Lieutenant-Colonel Hewitt’s designation was original ly 'Defence Officer, Persian Gulf”. This was later changed to 'Town Major, Bahrain'. The new designation was subsequently abandoned in favour of the original one^ but a further change | has recently been announced, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hewitt | is now styled 'Garrison Commander, Bahrain'. Bahrain Government Hospital During November and December British Service per sonnel to the number of 66 were given treatment as in-patients in the Bahrain Government Hospital. Nearly half the c-^ses treated were of malaria. Food Supplies (i) The embargo placed by the Sind Government on the export of cereals to the Persian Gulf has shocked and puzzled His Highness the Shaikh, who cannot understand how a local authority is permitted to pass orders which nullify and confound arrangements made by the Government of India. He has confidence, however, that the British Government and the Government of India will put things right again with a minimum of delay. / (ii)(ii) Reference paragraph 198 (ii) of Intelligence 3 umnrry No. 18 of 1942 in which mention was made of the 7835 tons of M.E.S.C. ’pool' oug-^r stored in Bahrain. ^ 2000 tons of this sugar is to be shipped to B^sra this month, and a further 2000 tons in February. (iii) A meeting of the Bahrain Food Committee, presided over by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Khalifnh, was held on January 12thc Bahrain’s food problems v/ere discussed from every angle, and a number of important resolutions were passed. The substance of these resolutions was '.s follows (c) Rice, wheat a n d flour . As the export of these commodi ties from Karachi, the principal source of supply, h'd been prohibited, it was necessary to ensure that the small stocks already in the Island were made to last as long as possible. The aggregate rice + flour A/heat ration was already so low that it could hardly be reduced further. But o .s stocks of rice were likely to be exhausted some weeks before stocks of flour/wheat, the Committee decided th^t the rice ration should be reduced from 12 lbs to 8 lbs per adult per month, and that the flour/wheat ration should be increased by 4 lbs. There has been much grumbling in the past at the smallness of the rice ration of 12 lbs per month, and the Committee’s decision will be unpopular with local -rabs, whose main article of diet is rice. The decision is, nevertheless^y jwise one, and is indicative of the realistic attitude wnich [ responsible people in Bahrain are at 1st adopting in reg .rd to the food problem. (b) Sugar . As it has hot been possible to obtain sugar from India for some months, and existing stocks are running lew, the Committee decided that the sugar ration of 4 lbs per n dult per month should be reduced to 2 lbs until such time as it wps possible to obtain further supplies from India. (c) Dates . In the markets of Manama and Muharraq, and _in villages where there are no date palms, dates are unobtainable. It is believed, however, that there are privately held stocks I of dates which are being kept for release if and when the controlled price of dates is raised. The Committee were unable to suggest any remedial measure but hoped that if, as was expected, a substantial quantity of dates arrived from Kuwait, local hoarders would then, in their own interesto, put their stocks on the market. 8 . Economic The inhabitants of certain villages on the west coast^of the Island, who have no cultivable land but are dependent for their livelihood on diving and weaving, are reported to be in deplorable state of destitution. The.Poor Relief Com mittee have been asked to give assistance in the more deserv ing cases. 9. Saudi Arabian Affair s At the end of November an article was published.in the newspaper ”A1 Bahrain” containing an appeal to the people.of Oatif to found a school there. This article, which was signed2 -KZf by its author, Ali A1 Shaikh Mansur al kurhun al ^tif i, was, on the face of it, wholly unobjectionable. But Ibn 3aud, know ing the author’s father to be an ardent Shia propagandist, and suspecting a possible political motive behind the appeal, has summoned both father and son to Riyadh where they have been temporarily detained« 10 • P .A.D, work at Awali The most important items in the costly and comprehensive programme of P.A.D. works for the Refinery have been completed. Since the danger of attack from the air has now diminished, it has been decided to M go slow” with the remaining portion of the programme. During the next few weeks only those works will be undertaken which do not require for their execution the import of further building material from Iraq. 11. The Bahrain Petroleum Company The Company are putting up four new two-storey bachelor quarters. Additional accommodation will be required ix, as is hoped, married British employees of the Company are.allowed to bring out their families from England to join them in •Bahrain. Additional accommodation would also be necessary if certain projects to extend the Refinery were sanctioned. Material for the construction of these quarters was imported in 1940 and has been lying in storage since then. 12• Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited The Company’s European and Indian staff were withdrawn from Qatar on 20th December 1942. Arrangements have been made to guard the Company’s houses at. Dukhan, in which furniture and fittings have been left, but all other equipment, stores, etc. have been removed. 13.

(iii) Reports have been received from merchants that the orice in Karachi of ’Bawli’ rice (the type commonly consumed in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast) has-been fixed by the Food Controller there at Fs 56 per c.^ndy. Shippers say that they cannot purchase this quality of rice at less than Ps 65-75 per V candy. The IV hr-in Government paid Ps 68 per candy for rice which they purchased recently in Karachi.

Stocks of tea, ii ^ they were not re-exported to Persia or Iraq, would be sufficient to last for many years. In view of the limited shipping space- now available on Gulf steamers it that during the month of October more th-n 30C tons of tea arrived at°Dubai by steamer from Bombay, 238. Food Su pplies - Saudi A raMa, (i) Disinterested persons acquainted with conditions on the mainland say that, though food is very expensive there, no real shortage exists. Poor people cannot a.xxori v- tu rice or dates or flour at their present prices, = and are con sequently half-starved. Saudi officials ir,v-r.iahl&gt; gyi this semi- starvation to the failure of supplies from -nuj.-, ■ but the real cause is undoubtedly the eyer-increasxng gap which ’ exists between the maximum price that the consumer c n to nay for his food and the minimum price at which ho can purchase it. The high prices of rice and flour are, of c-nr-sc, caused bv the increased cost of purchasing and tr'nsp^rt^ these commodities from India. The price of dates has risen abnormally because of the need of date growers and merchants to suoply themselves with the means cf purchasing imp rted essential foodstuffs at their increased prices. (ii) ;\n attempt is being made to control food prices Xs Tip 3r . P nd a delegation of Bahrain merchants recently visitou ^ Dhahraii to discuss the problem with a Saudi Committee presiao. over by Xbdul Rauf as Sabban. From reports received ^ appears th^t it wes vocided to restrict price control to ric^, su v : ix ^ flour 1 and ccffea.

The Bahrain Petroleum Cojopany . There is a feeling of unrest among British employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company caused by their continued detention in Bahrain without the opportunity of returning h m^c This feeling is naturally strongest among those whose wives or families or fianedes are in the British Isles, and contributing factors »rc both the enervating climate and the absence ot suitable feminine society.

(i) Reference para 173 (i) of Intelligen ce Summary Nod 6 of 1942, which referred to a scheme for the issue of flour to bakers instead of individual consumers and to the appointment of a Food Control Committee, The Committee were unanimously opposed to the ’bakero J scheme and on this occasion the Food Controller agreed with their recommendation. The scheme has accordingly been abandon ed and flour will continue to be handed out to individual con sumers, who will make their own arrangements for cooking it. During the month of Ramadhan every one who requires and can afford it is to be given 4 lbs. of Canadian wheat in addition to the existing (but manifestly insufficient) ration of 4 lbs. of flour, the smallness of which is mainly due to the non arrival of the monthly flour quotas from India. The only milling machine in Bahrain being out of order, individual con sumers will make their own arrangements for grinding their wheat ration on stone hand-mills, (ii) At the end of July the Bahrain Government were asked whether they could store sugar which was being collected by the M.E.S.C, for eventual use in Iran and Iraq 0 , they replied that storage was available in their Customs warehouse for 4.000 tons. In the last few weeks 7,835 tons of sugar have arrived and the Bahrain Customs are busily hiring godowns all over the town in which to accommodate this inconveniently large stock. Though the Bahrain Government have agreed to levy only one third of the usual storage charges and have, as a further special concession, reduced Customs duty on the consignment from 5% to 1 %, their revenues should materially benefit from this arrangement. Popular rumour, to which the Public Relations Officer has been asked to give the lie, has it that all this sugar was originally intended for Russia but had to be diverted here because,if it were sent to its original destination, it would be likely to fall into enemy hands. 186. Currency . Reference para 174 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No. 16 of 1942. which referred to the shortage of small coin in Bahrain. On September 5th the Eastern Bank received by sea a consignment of Ps 19,000 in small change, but most of it has already vanished from circulation. Since August 1st the Bank has paid out some Rs 25,000 in small change (of which about Rs 5,000 has gone to the Bahrain Petroleum Company,) and has only about Fs 5,000 left. The arrival of a further consignment is hoped for shortly. ^TU^ Military . 0 .POL.DBF&amp;I On the afternoon of September 5th a military manoe uvre 1 JAN ; 13 Ion the grand scale was performed by the detachment of the 3/llth' ,ia Regiment stationed at Bahrain. It was watched by a / large- 2 - largo and most interested audience which included the Political Resident, H.H. the Shaikh, many of the A1 Khalifah, a large contingent of .the State Police and many members of the European communityo The manoeuvre consisted of an attack by infanti-y and bren-guns, using live ammunition, smoke bombs and trench mortars, and supported by Machine Guns and two heavy guns, on an enemy entrenched position along a ridge* the enemy infantry were represented by petrol tinso After the hill had been taken and the troops re-assembled, the British and Indian Officers taking part were introduced to H.H. the Shaikh, who.was then taken^for a ride in a bren-gun carrier. At the beginning of the exercise the spectators were between the attacking infantry and their objective, and shells whistled over their heads. The whole of this realistic and instructive demonstration was carried through without casualties, human or animal. 188. Visitation of Storks . On September 4th it was reported from the Oil Camp at ^Awali that some 200 migrant birds of unknown species enormous size had arrived. One had committed suicide by flying into the Refinery and its carcase was sent to Mr. Bertram Thomas, the Public Relations Officer, for identification. It was pro nounced to be a stork and a tab round its leg read;— UWIV^RoITE KAUNAS LITHUANIE ® The fact that the local inhabitants have no name for these birds and that Bahrain notables went after them with guns, whereas in other parts of the Arab world they are never molested and are in places almost sacrosanct, suggests that Bahrain has seldom, if ever, seen them before. Two theories that have been advanced for their arrival here are (a) that they had been on some active war front and didn't like it,.and (b) that it might presage an early or severe winter. Finding no food at Bahrain, they flew on, in a direction not observed. It was, no doubt, a coincidence that the same night a son was born to Mrs. Wakelin, wife of the Bahrain Government Director of Educa tion. 189. Broadcastin g. On September 15th the following news item was broad cast from Radio Saigon*- strong contingent of American troops has landed in Bahrain, which is an oil-rich island in the Persian Gulf'? to control the oil interests and to defend the Americans . 190.

On August 28th H.H. the Jam Sahib of Nawa- nagar and Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, the Indian members of the War Cabinet and the Pacific War Council in London. (ii) Senior Royal Air Force Officers have visited Bahrain during the period under report. On August 16th Air Commodore J.P. Coleman, Air Officer in Charge Administration, R.A.F. in Iraq, passed through Bahrain in the morning en route to Shar jah and returned here for the night before leaving for Basra the next morning. On August 20th, the Air Officer Commanding Iraq, Air Vice Marshal H.V. De Crespigny, M.C., D.F.C., accom panied by Air dommodore M*B. Russell, D.F.C., A.F.C., n.0„C.

(iii) Reference para 159 (iv) of Intelligence Summary No.15 of 1942, which referred to the impending departure of Shaikh Fahad bin Salim as Subah of Kuwait and the possibility of hiembers of his entourage smuggling gold out of Bahrain. Before he and his party left on August 19th, Shaikh Fahad had all their baggage examined and threatened dire consequences if any gold was found. None was discovered: the party did, however, take away between one and two lakhs of rupee notes, / p ara reference/174 (ii) below in this connexion. 172. Defence. A signal Troop of 19 men, with vehicles and equipment, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th August. More are expected. 173. Food Supplies . (i) Local. The position as regards rice in Bahrain is now satisfactory, as there is over a month's reserve on the. raECin POL Si^T'lsland and the Government of India have increased the Bahrain RE^D. POL. DEPT.r ilotment 208 tons a month as a consequence of the Bahrain \ JAN 913 3 overnment , s representation (reference para 148 ( 1 ) of Ini.ell- ‘ 2^ Vphpp Rnmmprv No. 14 of 1942) . Flour is still short, as the INDIA P FFlCE/jf ull quota has not yet started arriving and there is- 2 - moro than a fortnight’s supply hero. However, nearly 1,000 tons of wheat arrived here from Canada at the beginning of August and constitute a reserve from which the flour supply can be supplemented when necessary. A scheme for the issue of flour to bakers employed and paid by the Bahrain^Govern ment, instead of to private individuals, and of ration cards to the populace for bread instead of flour is being worked out. A Food Control Committee has been appointed to assist and advise the Food Controller over food questions and to share his responsibility. Hitherto the Committee has never failed to disagree with the Food Controller, notably as regards the disposal of the wheat referred to above. . Though it should constitute some five months’ supply, the Committee recommended that almost the whole of it should be distributed during the one month of Ramadhan as a solace to the people for the recent shortage. This suggestion was vetoed by the powers but the wheat reserve is likely to have decreased substanoj.aa.^.y by the end of Ramadhan, unless adequate supplies of flour arrive in the meantime. The authorities have been asked to distribute the wheat as economically as possible. (ii) For Saudi Arabi a. On the 24th August the German radio announced that the British scheme for supplying Saudi . Arabia with food supplies from India had broken down owing to the absence of the supplies. This announcement was made when the final arrangements were in fact crystallising and it was hoped that the scheme was about to be launched. But agree ment on details has not yet been reached by all concerned and the scheme still hangs fire. The Shaikh of Bahrain has been informed of the proposals and welcomes them, as he hopes that the price control which the scheme will presumably in volve will put an end to the merchants’ present practice oj. diverting all supplies possible from Bahrain to the mainland, where profits are greater. 174. Currency . (i) The price of sovereigns having, as^already reported, remained more or less stationary at Es 59 during the first half of August, declined to Rs 57 on the 24th and finally closed^at Rs 57/8/- on August 31st. These quotations are purely nominal, as very little business in sovereigns is being done. (ii) Reference para 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No. 13 of 1942, which reported large' exports of rupee notes *** ^ from Bahrain to Kuwait. On August 20th the Manager of the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, reported that some 7 to 8 lakhs woroh of rupee notes had gone out of Bahrain in the past 3 weeks,^apparently to. Kuwait, and requested Government assistance in obtaining air freight from Karachi for an immediate consignment of 4r 2 lakhs of notes and for such consignments thereafter as might be necessary; the alternative being for all drawers of other than local cheques or drafts to be charged 12 % commission on^ account of the cost to the Bank, in freight and insurance, ox bringing the notes by sea. Rs 4j lakhs.of notes arrived on the 24th August, after having awaited air space at Karachi tor over a fortnight. The Bank has already brought over Rs 41 lakhs of notes from India since the beginning.of this year, as against an average of Rs 10 lakhs per year in previous The normal process now appears to.be.for the notes exported from Bahrain to be changed in Kuwait into Dinar notes, which are taken to Basra and converted into Rupee drafts on India. (i-ii) There is a great shortage of small change in Bahrain, v / due/ I I ^ 175. 6 &gt;m 176. 177. 178. b ^ 179. 180 due partly to hoarding by those of the poorer classes with money to save, who find it preferable to hoard coin rather than notes as it neither burns nor rots and has some intrinsic value. The Bank is expediting a consignment ox^GTTlri^ steamer shortly, to relieve the shortage. The Oil Companies. Reference para 162 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.15 pf. 1942, which announced an increase in the output of the Bahrain Oil Refinery to 33,500 barrels of crude a day. The daily production of crude oil from the Bahrain Field has now in creased to 18,000 barrels. Local affairs. Reference para 125 (ii) of Intelligence Sum mary No. 12 of 1942 regarding the collection of ’’Relief of the Poor” Funds. Ill feeling between the Shias and Sunnis during the past two months has been very bitter and has been fomented by talk in clubs and by trouble-seekers. On the 27th August a joint meeting of the members of both Sunni and Shia Committees was held under the aegis of His Highness the Shaikh. After much discussion both parties agreed to His Highness’ suggestion that a joint Committee, consisting of from.4 to 6 members of each community, should be formed, with Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, His Highness' uncle, as President, to meet once.a month and distribute the funds collected; thus co-operation, at least on the surface, has been achieved. The Sunnis, who contain a larger proportion of The Rich, gave Fs 1500 (actually provid ed wholly by His Highness) to the Shias in fulfilment of a previous promise, and also half of the donationsby non-Moslems, which now total over Fs 4000.» On August 29th,.to celebrate this happy rapprochement, a garden party was given by one of the Shia notables, which was attended by His Highness, the Adviser, and members of both Sunni and Shia Committees. American Mission* s Tour to Saudi Arabia. On August 17th Dr. and Mrs. Harrison and Dr.Barney, of the American Mission, Bahrain, with one male and two female Indian nurses, a party of 11 in all, left Bahrain on 1-1 month's special medidal trip to Riyadh to treat members of the household of King Ibn Saud, as well as uhe general public.

(ii) In the second half of June (vide para.118 (i) of Intelli gence Summary No.12 of 1942) the margin of profit allowed to merchants importing rice and flour was raised from 10 % to. 20 %. This concession was made in order to induce merchants to import these commodities into Bahrain rather than to other ports in the Persian Gulf, especially those in Saudi Arabia, where.no price control existed and where profits were phenomenally high. The system of issuing permits for the export of quota goods from India has recently been changed, and the Bahrain Government, owing to the power which they now have to distribute quotas as they please among local merchants, are no longer compelled to pander to their avarice. The margin of profit allowed on imported quota goods has accordingly been reduced to 5%. Merchants who are not pre pared to accept this profit will not be given a share in the trade in rice, flour, sugar etc. ^ those who do accept the profit of 5% will be compelled to import foodstuffs to the limit of the quota allotted to them on pain of forfeiting their right to future quotas. (iii) The presence in Bahrain of so many Defence personnel dependent on the local market for supplies of fresh food has drained the bazaar of most of its usual stocks. -^ggs and potatoes are unobtainable, while moat and vegetables cost so much that only the wealthier classes can afford them. The price of dates has risen, but fish is plentiful and still comparatively cheap. (iv) Though there are extensive date gardens on the island, Bahrain has always had to supplement its supply of locally grown dates with imports from Arabia and Iraq to the value of several lakhs of rupees annually. This year difficulty is being ex- perienced in obtaining dates since their export from Hasa has been forbidden and their price in Iraq is.prohibitive. .Private negotiations are in progress which will result, it is hoped, in permission being given for the export to Bahrain -j- rom Hasa or 10,000 gallas of dates (valued at about Ps 30,000), but efforts to obtain dates from Iraq at a reasonable price have so far proved abortive. Iraqi date owners, it is reported, refuse to sell locally at the price fixed by the Iraq Government as they can secure .higher prices in Syria. Whether Bahrain, in order to secure its minimum essential requirements of dates, should make.purchases in the ’black market' is a question which is now being given consideration by His Highness the Shaikh. (v) Various members of the A1 Khaliiah, when applying . ration cards, supplied exaggerated figures of the number of their dependents. The - Food Controller had neither the knowledge nor the courage to reduce those figures to their correct proportions, but His Highness the Shaikh has now intervened and appointed ms cousin, Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohammed bin Isa al Khalifah, tu.be a. member of the Food Control Advisory Committee.with the special duty of seeing that members of the Ruling Family do not take . advantage of their position to secure preferential treatment m the distribution of food rations. 222. Ford Sup plies - Saudi A rabia. Reference para 199 of Intelligence Summary No.18 of 1942 in which it was reported that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain had agreed to release 300 tons of wheat on loan to the Saudi Govern ment. The amount which has actually been shipped to Saudi Arabia is 3000 bags (225 tons). It is not known if or when shipment^of the balance of the 75 tons promised will be asked for by the oaudi Government. ^-3- ($) 223. Currency - Bahrain . (i) The price of sovereigns has dropped fractionally from Rs 56/8/- to Ps 56/-/- . (ii) There are still no signs of a recrudescence of the gold smuggling which took place earlier in the summer, and it seems that the Political Agent’s order of July 21 st making bullion * brokers submit weekly statements of their transactions in gold has proved to be an even greater deterrent to smuggling than was expected at the time (vide para 149 (i) of Intelligence Summary No o14 of 1942). (iii) Reference para 186 of Intelligence Summary No.x7 of 1942 in which a shortage of small coin in Bahrain was reported. The shortage has become even more marked than it was, and bazaar trade is suffering as a consequence. Neither shopkeepers nor their customers possess small change, and the only means of obtaining i is by purchase - at a substantial premium - from one or other oi the Ring of brokers who have made a corner of small coin. The Bahrain Government were assailed by so many complaints from the public that they began devising laws and regulations prohibiting the hoarding of small coin, penalising its sale at other than i s face value, and so on. They were eventually dissuaded from en- acting this legislation, which would certainly have had results exactly the reverse of what was desired, and were advised to await patiently the arrival of a large consignment, of small.coin which, the Eastern Bank had ordered from Bombay. Ps 30,000 in small com would already have arrived by the end of the period under report . had not the Captain of the steamer which was to bring it to Bahrain refused to take delivery as there was no strong room on his snip. The consignment is expected to arrive by another steamer early m November. When it does arrive, and when so much small com.is pu into circulation, members of the Ring will be put out of business ^ and will probably liquidate their own holdings. It may be observer on passent, that it is the contraction in their business in gold which has led brokers to attempt a 'corner in small oo in * brokers have a considerable amount of capital, which they cannot bear to leave idle. Operations on the gold market being d«,nie . - them they naturally looked for an alternative method of making their money productive. It will be interesting.to see what new scheme they embark upon when their present activities cease to bo remunerative. 224. Currency - Qatar ., That rupoG notes are not welcomed in Qatar is evident from correspondence which has recently taken place between Shaikh Abdullah bin nasim al Thani and Mr. Packer, Local Manager of PetrolGum Development■(Qatar) Ltd. The Shaikh sent Mr. Packer a cheque for Rs 20,000 on the Sastern Bank, oroceods might be sent to him in silver. Mr. Packer ^P- 1 - the proceed! of the cheque, if paid _ in silver would amount only to Rs 19&lt;a00o The Shaikh wos then in a quandary. It would rt. . his Whole being to accept Fs 19,100 when he was ^titled to Rs20^000, at the same time he was aware that rupee notes ’ydl, Sfantnallv their face value in purchasing power in his terr q?g• ^ he decided to take the full Rs 20,000 in notes. The reasons t~r this decision are conjectural, but probab y ^ d payments reluctantly to the conclusion that for local puuenc.s P r, he would have to draw on his substantial hoardings of si^r rupees while the notes could be used for P^^asos in India. Tho follow _- na ov+r^rt from a letter sent by the Shaikh to ivir. racKei indicative of the annoyance which the whole affair occasions »» j express my deep regret at this unexpected treatment given me by th!

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Bahrain by the L.T. ,, Nearchus n on the morning of the 10th August lor a stay of about a month in Bahrain. (ii) The Political Agent went to Sharjah by B *°* A *£* _ plane on the morning of the 4th August and returned by R.A.F,. plane on the morning of the 7th. On the morning of August 1 he left Bahrain by B.O.A.C. plane on a month's recess in India. 159. Other Visitors . (i) On August 1st Sir Sikander Hayat Khan, Premier of the Punjabi, passed through Bahrain on the westbound Flying Boat. (ii) Lieut.-Commander Quicke, Staff Officer (Signals) to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, left Bahrain on the 12th August, after a fortnight's stay, four days of which he spent in hospital suffering from acute sun-burn. (iii) The following military officers visited Bahrain during the period under report:- Major J.G.

It is hoped that this guarantee will be effective. 160. R.A.F. Levies . Reference para 115 of Intelligence Summary No.12- 2 - of 1942, in which mention was made of the slow rate of recruit ment of levies at Sharjah. On his recent visit to Sharjah, the Political Agent discussed this question with the Shaikh, as well as with Captain Lyle (Officer Commanding Levies, Dubai and Sharjah) and the Residency Agent, Sharjah. The Shaikh of Sharjah has no objection to levies for the Sharjah Companies being recruited from outside - whether from Dubai or elsewhere* The difficulty at both Sharjah and Dubai is not so much that, of initial recruitment, as that recruits, after serving for a month, then depart for their homes with a month’s pay in their pockets. The Shaikhs are not unhelpful, but their more active backing is necessary before such difficulties can be removed. On his return to Bahrain the Political Agent discussed the question with Lieut,-Colonel Hall, who left Bahrain by B.O.A.C. plane on August 11th for a tour down the coast. 161. Slave Traffic u \V\ (i) Referehce para 119 of Intelligence Summary No.12 o f_^ 1942, in which mention was made of the recrudescence of the slave trade on the Persian Coast. A recent report from a Nakhuda of Dubai tells of how, after leaving Kalat on the Persian coast, he encountered a jolly boat with 50 armed pirates who opened fire on him. After hearing from these pirates of the existence of four other boats in the vicinity with a similar complement of men and arms, the Nakhuda returned to Dubai with the maximum despatch. He arrived there on August 1st. (ii) Reference para 157 of Ijitelligenc-e—Summary No, 14_of^ ^ 1942, which told of the peregrinations of Mirza bin Barkat. This gentleman is reported to have returned to Kalba from Muscat territory towards the end of July, and to have stayed at a place called As Saf, some 8 miles south of Kalba, while his boat was being mended at Khaur Kalba. He was last seen on or about the 27th of July sheltering in his boat at an islet just outside Khor Fakkan and,on receiving a warning from the local inhabitants, is then said to have left for an unknown destination. His family is believed to be still in Muscat territory at Fazh with the Riyasah tribe. 162. The Oil Companies . u (i) Reference para 136(i) ol Intelligence Summary No.13 ^ of 1942, in which the decrease in the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Com pany was referred to. On the 1st of August the output of the Bahrain Refinery was increased to 25,000 barrels of crude a day, and was further increased on the 15th August to 33,500 barrels* Of this, 15,000 barrels will continue to be produced from the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Field, the balance being imported from Saudi Arabia. In consequence of this increase of work at the Refinery, practically all the personnel who had been rendered surplus (vide para 124(iO of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942) have now been re-engaged. Most of them had in the meantime been employed on sheathing and construction work. / (ii) On August 14th at 12.20 p.m. a U.S. Army Transport plane landed at the Bahrain airfield, having brought from Basra six American civilians attached to the American Military Mission at Cairo. They had come to inspect certain equipment, rolling stock, cranes, etc. of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, with a view to buying it for the American Army. They had sent no previous intimation of their coming and were apparently unaware that this equipment was not at Bahrain or that there might be any difficulty over their seeing it. As they had to leave the following day and ordinary methods^of communication with Dhahran would have involved considerable delay, (the Company’s daily launch having already left Bahrain), the Company were authorised to arrange by radio telephone for three members of the party to visit Dhahran that afternoon;Cvftt'fttrl 4^ they here.at about 3.45 p.m. One member of the party is still at Dhahran; the remainder returned to Basra at 2 p.m. on August 15th, giving a lift to four British personnel of various services who had been visiting Bahrain. 163. Small Pox at Dubai and Sharjah . There has been a small outbreak of smallpox at Dubai and Sharjah, 7 cases at the former place and 2 at the latter. One person has died and five of the 9 patients have now been discharged. There is vaccine in plenty at Sharjah. 164. The Shaikh of Fujairah . Reference para 134 of Intelligence Summary No.13^ of A 1942* in which it was reported that Shaikh Mohammad bin ash Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujairah, had gone on a visit to Riyadh. The Shaikh of Fujairah passed through Bahrain on the 10th August on his return from Riyadh. . He is anxious to interest Petroleum Concessions Limited in the production or oil in Fujairah, and went to see Mr. Lermitte, the Company s representative in Bahrain. Mr. Lermitte told him that his Company would not enter into any new commitments or engagements until after the War. 165. The Shaikh of Hira . Shaikh Abdur Rahman of Hira died on the 10th August and was succeeded by his younger son, Saif. 166. Local Rumours . Visiting bedous from the mainland have informed H.H. the Shaikh that people in Saudi Arabia are saying that the British are encouraging Ibn Saud to make trouble with Asir and the Yemen, on the old ’‘divide and rule ,k principle that if all the Arabs ’’looked in the same direction” there was a danger of their turning against Britain, and that their atten tion should therefore be turned into local channels. It is for this reason that we are heavily subsidising Ibn Saud (to whom His Highness had heard that recent large payments of gold had been made). It is said, further, that if the Germans reach Iraq they are likely to be welcomed by the Iraqis, and therefore we are encouraging Ibn Saud to mass his bedous on the Iraqi frontier. These stories do not as yet appear to have had much circulation in Bahrain* 167, Economic. (i) Currency . Practically no movement of sovereigns has been reported during the period under review. The price has remained steady at Rs 59 or thereabouts. (ii) Profiteering. Information has been received which indicates that certain Bahrain flour merchants have given standing instructions to their agents at Karachi to add 12^ to 13% on the genuine cost of flour in their invoices. It should not be difficult to defeat this particular form of rascality by acquiring regular information of the correct Karachi wholesale prices, and steps in this connexion are being taken. 168. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 110.8° on August 7th. Minimum temperature 81.3 on August 5th. Average minimum temperature during the period under / reportreport was^S S. S^ ^ twice went below 7CW and exceeded 80% on 10 days and 90% on 5. The maximum was 93% on August 12th, From the above it appears that the final sentenc of the last Summary needs further revision.

(ii) The Hon’ble Lieut .-Colonel V.RoHay, C.I.iii., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived on September 26th having v flown in an R.A.F. plane from Bushire. He remained at Bahrain until the end of the period under report. (iii) The Hon’ble Lieut.-Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.E., arrived at Bahrain on September 29th, having flown by B.O.A.C. plane from Cairo.

During his visit he' studied problems connected with the projected use throughout the Middle East of coke from the Bahrain Refinery. (iii) Colonel Woodland, of the Royal Corps of signals, arrived on September 17th and spent some days in Bahrain or ganising military communications in the island. (iv) Ma.ior Griffin, a representative of the M.E.S.C.. arrived on September 24th accompanied by Mr. Negib Salha • pare 199 below). They left for the mainland on September 29th. Major Griffin’s intention was to travel overland to Jeddah via Riyadh. 195. Defence . There occurred, during the period under report, a substantial accession to the strength of Bahrain s A.A. defences^ 196. Roval Air Force . A machine piloted by Wing Commander Gyll-Murray, O.C. R.A.F. , Sharjah, made a forced landing near Dohah, in the Qatar peninsula, on September 17th. The aircr . - staff seriously damaged and every assistance was rendered by the stall of the Qatar Oil Company. 197. Currency . (i) The price of sovereigns in Bahrain^has remained steady *)t P- 56/8/-. The price of gold in Bahrain is still substantial ly lower than it is in Basrah or Kuwait, and the margin of difference is sufficient to act as a stimulus to smug g ling. The steadiness of the local price indicates, However, that smuggling is no longer taking place on any but a n^gligibl scale. (ii) Reference para 149 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.14 ,of 1942 in which it was reported that the premium on Saudi^Riyp.ls had risen to Fs 85 per thousand Riyals# At present the premium on Saudi Riyals is Rs 20 per thousand if Riyals are purchased for silver rupees.. If rupee currency notes are tendered, the premium on Riyals is Rs 60 per thousand Riyals« The fall in the value of the Riyal against the rupee is believed to be due to a decline in the demand for Riyals from Kuwait (cf. para 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No,13 of 1942). ^ Riyals are still reported to be scarce through out Hasa« 198. Food Supplies - Bahrain (i) For several months shipments of rice and wheat flour from India to Bahrain have been disappointingly small, and the island has been receiving only a fraction of its allotted ? of these commodities. Stocks of rice are sufficient on y three weeks, and there is less than one week s supply of flou available. As the public have been receiving up to date thei full ration (small though it is) of rice and flour, there is no general anxiety about the food position. But H.H. the Shaikh is aware of the real state of affairs and is deeply worried and anxious. Mitigating factors are the good date crop, and a reserve of several hundred tons of Canadian wheat. But 11 , as seeJS l?ke?y, stScks of rice become exhausted in the course of the winter an economic crisis will ensue which will almos certainly be attended by grave political consequences. (ii) Reference para 185 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.17 of 1942 in which it was reported that 7835 tons of sugar h. been stored in Bahrain by the M.E.3.C. for eventual use m Iran and Iraq. The maiority of this sugar has now been stored in go-downs but many hundreds of bags are still stacked on e Customs pier. The sight of so much su ^ a ^. su o ar comment locally. Many housewives are ask ^^ h ^ ^ e , s ^® ntity ration should not be increased when there is so vast a of sugar stored in-Bahrain. Others argue that if the British Government has such large reserves of sugar it must also have equally large reserves of rice and flour with which, in im of need, it can help the people of Bahrain. The la S mant illoeical and fallacious as it obviously is, appears everywhere S to be accepted as valid, and there will be a v i°l ent revulsion of feeling should the shortage °f acute and help from the 'British Government' fail to materialise. L99. Food Supplies - Saudi Arabia. Major Griffin, representing the M.E.S.C., and Mr. Nesib S*lha, one of Ibn Spud’s Ministers, visited Bahrain during ^period under report in order to discuss with the Political Resident the merits and practicability of various schemefwhich have been propounded with the double objects of supplying Saudi Arabia with essential foodstuffs from an^l of enabling the Saudi Government to attract to its ireasury at leasHhe number of Riyals which it squires to finance t its public services. Major Griffin was mainly i^gib Salha ^rn»t+i*nn noiu i vion- -of long-term problems. Mr. kt-gio oaina proved to be lels interelted in arrangements or undertakings for the future than in the problem of . immed i P i“ ^N^e rice Q=nrH A-po-hia Gspeciallv for the Province of Hasa where nc^ and flour are badly needed, and it seemed that he was timorous tons°of wheaf ofloaiffrom H?h! the^haikh of Bahrain on the with the Political Agent, Kuwait, in regard to supplies o-3- EX - I suga.ro Only in respect of rice, the commodity needed most of all in Saudi Arabia, did he fail in his pleadings. In Bahrain and Kuwait rice is too precious to be spared even to a friendly neighbour 0 200o Anti-British sentiment . There are very few people in Bahrain with marked anti-British feelings. Those who have such feelings are mainly semi-educated youths who resent, on general grounds, the presence in Bahrain of foreigners whose influence is so obviously paramount in the shaping th £ Ltwin^t A cliaue of such youths has been m the habit of.gathering . the coffee-shop of a certain Ahmed al Farah to discuss news heard over the Berlin and Rome wireless. On September 17tn Ahmed al Farah was arrested for preparing and during day-time (Ramadhan is strictly observed in Bahrain;, and Isa bin Hijris, Hitler’s most vocal adherent in Bahrain, was arrested for eating food in a coffee-shop during forbidden hours. The arrests are approved by public opinion, which has no sympathy for persons who openly offend against religious propriety. 201. Local Affairs .

The Committee expended a substantial portion of the funds at its disposal on the purchase.of rice, the intention being to dole out rice in small quantities to persons who could not afford to buy it for themselves.

MiUiQ The Political Agent left Bahrain for Qatar in the early morning of July 2nd and returned in the afternoon of July 4th. 130. Visitors . (i) Sir Edward Benthall, Colonel Reynolds and Major C.A.G Savidge arrived in Bahrain on July 10th and stayed the night at the Agency. They left for India the following day. (ii) On July 11th Sir Jeremy Raisman and Sir Theodore Gregory passed through Bahrain on the Tfestbound flying boat• (iii) During the period under report a number of military and R.A.F. officers visited Bahrain. 131. Roval Air Force . The--Shaikh of Qatar has given his verbal, assent 1,0 the location on the Qatar coast of a number of wireless obser vation units. The Political Agent declined to entertain the Shaikh's suggestion that the R.A.F. ^personnel.manning.these should wear Arab dress. 132. Defence . This island is not yet an armed fortress, but during the period under report there were further welcome additions to the strength of its defences. Military dispositions have been separately reported 133. Economic. (i) Food Supplies . Supplies of wheat-flour, su.xicient to meet current requirements, have now been received in Bahrai , and there is at the moment no shortage of any essential xood- stuffs. The picking of the date crop is beginning. (ii) War Allowances . On the 5th July the Bahrain Govern ment announced the' grant of a special 'War Aliowance to all their employees in receipt of monthly pay ^° t + ®y As the allowance has been granted because of the rise in the cost of essential foodstuffs it will not be paid to ^° v ®™?en servants, such as the police, who receive f ree food or ratio s The allowance is on a sliding scale designed to give prac recognition to the fact that lower paid employees spend a greater proportion of their pay on essential foodstuffs th .n do hisher paid employees. Persons in receipt of pay up to pf 50/- g p!m? are Zing given an allowance of two annas in the runee of their pay, persons whose pay is betweeny +, „ Bs 100 p.m. receive an allowance of one a R nn ? ® 1 ^S 1 ^ 5 o „ m! rupee; and persons whose pay is between Bs 100 and K150 p.m get an allowance of one anna in the rupee. (iii) C|rre£2X^he be gi nn ing of June the price of S0 Y®^?^f nS in Bahrain was Bs 52/-. During the month the price gradua y riXS ?o over i.D. 5, th. price of freeze. . 7K ' - 2 - Bahrain jumped to Rs 65o By July 7th the price had doclinod to Rs BC^and, at the end of the period under report the price was fairly steady at Rs 59-60. The price of sovereigns appears to fluctuate with, the ebb and flow of Allied military fortunes; when the Allies suffer reverses, the price of sovereigns rises; when fortune smiles on the Allied arms, the sovereign at once declines in value. (b) Rupee notes to the value of several lakhs of rupees have been exported from Bahrain to Kuwait in recent weeks. Brokers from Kuwait arrive with rupee drafts on Bah rain, which are met by payment in rupee notes. These notes are then taken by dhow to Kuwait, where they arc tendered in payment of further rupee drafts on Bahrain. The profit on this transaction is believed to be about 1.5%. It is under stood in Bahrain that the Kuwait Bank obtains most of its requirements of rupee notes from these brokers. The Bahrain Bank imports currency notes from India by air, and by this means avoids the heavy insurance charges levied on notes carried by British India Steam Navigation Company steamer?. The Kuwait Bank, however, cannot import notes direct by air, and it is cheaper for them to buy in the local market notes which have come from Bahrain than to obtain their requirements by sea from India. Kuwaiti brokers are also operating in another manner• They arrive here with rupee drafts on Bahrain, which are duly cashed. With the proceeds are purchased drafts on Qatif, which are used for the purchase of Saudi Riyals at a premium of Rs 50-60 per thousand Riyals. These Saudi Riyals are then sent by dhow to Kuwait where they are sold to Iraqi merchants at a premium of 2 annas per Saudi Riyal, or Rsl25 per thousand Saudi Riyals. With the proceeds of the sale of these Saudi Riyals fresh rupee drafts on Bahrain are obtained, and.the circle of profit begins again. In so far as the Saudi Riyals finding their way to Kuwait are used by Iraqi merchants for the purchase from Bedouin of camels, sheep, goats, skins etc., this commerce is legitimate and useful. It is not unlikely, however, that many of the Riyals which reach Iraqi hands via Bahrain and Kuwait are used for the purchase of gold, in res- ’ pact cf which there appears to be an inexhaustible supply in Saudi Arabia and an insatiable demand in Iraq. 134. The Shaikh of Fu.iair ah. Reference para 120 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad al Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujairah, had arrived at Bahrain on June 27th. After a short stay in Bahrain as the guest of H.H. Shaikh Salman, the Shaikh of Fujairah left for the mainland en route to Riyadh where he proposes to see Ibn Saud. 135. Bahrain and Qatar . Reference para 91 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which some account was given of H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain’s attitude towards Qatar. During his recent visit to Dohah the'Political Agent raised tentatively with the Shaikh of Qatar the question of relations with Bahrain. Though the Political Agent made an oblique approach to the subject, the Shaikh’s reaction was violent in the extreme. He behaved as would a cask of gun powder to which the flame of a match is brought gradually closer; however gentle and insensible the approach of the match, the moment contact is made an explosion occurs. Ihus the Shaikh of Qatar exploded. He could not understand, he said, why the Shaikhs of Bahrain were carrying on so virulent ’ / andand unremitting a campaign of hate against him. He had done 06- nothing, he asserted, to provoke their enmity, and he could not understand why they took every opportunity of insulting him and persecuting his subjects. When the Political Agent murmured the word ,T Zubara M 5 the volcanic old Shaikh erupted again. What had Zubara to do with Bahrain, or Bahrain with Zubara, he asked: Could he not deal with his tribesmen in his own way, without interference from outsiders? When the stream of invective lava had somewhat subsided, it was possible to ascertain the immediate cause of the old man's vehemence. He had recently had occasion to buy some sugar. At Bahrain, which is a closed market to him, the price is Rs 45/- per bag, but at Dubai, whence he now obtains his supplies, the price is Rs 80/- per bag. The Shaikh loves money for its own sake, and the fact that the Bahrain embargo on exports.to Qatar causes him financial loss makes him resentful and bitter. Long after the occurrence of the main explosion, and when the con versation had passed to quite other topics, the Shaikh still spluttered and muttered whenever there passed through his mind some momentary thought of the outrage caused to his pocket by the actions of the irredentist A1 Khalifah. 136. The Oil Compani es. (i) Reference para 124 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which a very considerable decrease in the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company was reported. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have similarly been compelled to reduce production, and have dis charged twenty of their Staff Employees. The question of how they are to return these employees to the U.S.A..is causing the Company some difficulty. They hope to obtain.the use of a Pan American Airways machine as space is not available in B.O.A.C. aircraft. (ii) The readiness of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to cooperate in matters connected with the War is illustratedby the following incident. On the evening of the 8th July a naval vessel arrived off Bahrain with a broken fuel pump. She could not proceed on her way without the pump being repaired - and repairs could only be carried out by experts in a well- equipped workshop. On the morning of July 9th the defective sections of the pump were taken to AwaJi, and the Company's assistance was invoked. Mr. Ward Anderson gave orders for.the job to be taken in hand at once. The pump was repaired with out delay, and the ship was enabled to proceed on her way the same afternoon. (iii) Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. are closing down their operations in Qatar pending the return of more stable world conditions. It is hoped to find employment for oheir skilled personnel with other Oil Companies in.India or the. Middle East. A skeleton staff will be retained at Bahrain. 137. Broadcasting . On the evening of Thursday, July 2nd, Bari (Italy) announced in their Arabic broadcast that.the Duke.of Gloucester, on his recent visit to Bahrain, had promised to give the Snaikn two Italian guns from Libya. The announcer stated that the guns had not yet arrived, and added that, at the moment, the guns would be more useful to the British in Libya than m Bahrain. 138• Pearls . Two months of the pearling season have now passed, and it is possible to give a brief review of the condition# of the industry. The number of pearling dhows which have gone out is slightly larger than last year• The price of pearls in Bahrain is about 15% higher than it was at the r / corresponding-4- • v corresponding period of last, year, but. is lower v,han the at the end of last season. The number of pearls brought, in so far is small, as weather conditions have been unfavourable and the smaller dhows have spent much of the last two months taking shelter from the unusually high winds which have swept down the Gulf from time to time. Profits are expected to be below average as the greatly increased cost of foodstuffs has added enormously to the expense of maintaining the crews oi pearlers. The demand for pearls from India is said to be quite good, but not good enough to make up for the loss oi other markets. Generally speaking, the current pearling season seems likely to be poor but not as bad as that oi ly^u. 139. Lo cal Affairs . The Adviser to the Bahrain Government was recently called upon to exercise his judicial ingenuity in a case which excited a good deal of local interest. Two ladies live m neighbouring houses; but their feelings have for long been anything but neighbourly. The younger lady, Miriam, has a husband, but has parted from him. The elder lady, Ayesha, is a widow, and is said to be jealous of Miriam. Ayesha knew that the law inflicts penalties on those who openly abuse their fellows, so she devised an indirect method of insulting ner neighbour. When her nanny-goat gave birth to a kid, sbe christened the offspring 'Miriam': And at all hours of the day, and sometimes at night, she would hurl abuse at Miriam. No term of imprecation was too indecent, no objurgation too obscene, to be launched at the innocent scapekid; and the name of Miriam, never without abusive epithets attached, echoed ceaselessly round the quarter where the two ladies lived. Miriam, the lady, took offence at Ayesha’s conduct , and sought redress in the court of the Adviser. The Politi cal Agent would like to report that the Adviser settled the ppqp aa theatrically as Solomon would have done. in laci., however, the Adviser took the sensible if non-dramatic course of arranging a compromise through friends of_the two ladies. Now the kid is no longer thetargef of vicarious abuse, and the ladies have resolved their differences. 140. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 102.1° Minimum tempefdture 8l;2 Humidity exceeded 70% on 3 on 6th July, on 14th July. days, the maximum being 73% on the 7th and 14th July. Until nearly the end of P° rio&lt; ?. und0 ^ r ?P° r l.® t North Wind blew with greater or less intensity, and the first fortnight of July proved to be climatically less mtoierao than any similar period since April.

(i) The Hon ! ble Lt.-Col* W.R.Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived at Bahrain by air from Basrah on the morning of 27th July, and left for Bushire in the same aeroplane on the morning of 29th July* (ii) On July 23rd and 24th the Political Agent visited the islands of Jeddah, Umm Na^an and Bena* 143.

Before the Shaikh left, His Royal Highness presented to him a Sighed photograph of himself in a silvefr frame. The Duke had intended to resume his flight to Basrah at 2.30 p.nw, but a defedt in hisi aeroplane made it necessary for him to postpone his departure till 5k40 pm* The inter vening period was spent by the Dhke at the Agency. H.H* the Shaikh took the greatest pleasure in renew ing his adduaintance with His Royal Highnest,. When they met they greeted each other as would old friends, without constraint or formality; and the Shaikh T s delight found expression in his conversation which was unusually free and animated. His Royal Highness* second visit to Bahrain has confirmed the im pression created by the first visit, and has left in Shaikh*s mind an indelible picture of Royal dignity, simplicity . and graciousness. 144. Other Visitors . (i) Brigadier Minnis arrived on July 21st and left on July 25th after inspecting P.A.D. work at Awali. (ii) Shaikh Fahad bin Salim aSSubah, Controller of Finance in Kuwait and the eon of a formei Ruler of that Shaikh dom, arrived in Bahrain on July 24th. He is the guest of H.H. Shaikh Salman, to whom he is paying a friendly visit. He travelled from Kuwait by the overland route. 145. r ■ El/ Honours. (i) H.M. the King has approved the grant to H.H. Shaikh Salman of a personal salute of 11 guns. (The dynastic salute of the Ruler of Bahrain is 7 guns). (ii) Lieut.-Commander W.J.King, Naval Officer in Charge, Bahrain, has been promoted to the rank of Commanaer. 146. R.A.F. Levies . (i) Colonel Brawn and Lt.-Colonel Hall visited Bahrain during the period under report. The latter unfortuna e y had an attack of malaria, for-which he had to be treated at the Oil Company’s hospital at Awali. (ii) A number of captured Italian machine guns and rifles have arrived for issue to the levies. ('•Hi')-2- xxz XV A i (iii)On July 25th the levies marched, to the strains of the Police band, from their old quarters near the Fort in Manama to their new barracks on Miharraq Island, The march was a great success, and large and friendly crowds lined the route, 147. British Overseas Airways Corporation , At the beginning of May 1942 the British Overseas Airways Corporation announced that there would be five ser vices a week, Bast and West, through Bahrain. Three services were to be by flying boat and two by land plane. Subsequently one of the flying boat services was given up, and now the two landplane services have also been discontinued. Since July 20th there have been only two flying boats a week each way, 148. Food Supplies . (i) Reference para 118(i) Of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that a system of card ration ing for rice, flour and sugar had been introduced. The ration for rice was fixed by Mr. de Grenier, the Bahrain Government Food Controller, at 12 oz. per head per day, or 22^ lbs. per month, an amount which was described as ’’the generally prevailing Army ration”. The issue of rations at this rate rapidly depleted existing stocks of rice, and belated calculations by the Food Controller showed that, if everybody drew their full rations, monthly consumption of rice would amount to more than double the quantity of rice which Bahrain, under the new quota system, is permitted to import. On making this discovery the Food Controller precipitately reduced the rice ration to 12 lbs. a month, a quantity which is manifestly inadequate for people who make rice the main article of their diet. As H.H. the Shaikh was greatly disturbed at these developments, and appeared to think that Bahrain’s rice quota was only about half of the population’s minimum requirements, the Political Agent suggested to the Adviser that he should personally examine and verify the figures, provided by the Food Controller himself, on which Bahrain’s rice quota had been based. The Adviser’s preliminary inquiries indicate that the Food Controller’s original estimates of Bahrain’s minimum requirements of rice were much too low. If the result of these preliminary inquiries is confirmed the Bahrain Government will no doubt ask for a revision of their rice quota. (ii) The Bahrain date crop this year is above average. (iii) The bazaar price of meat, eggs, milk and vegetables has risen owing to the demand for these commodities by the contractors who supply the various defence units now stationed in the island. 149. Currency . (i) Reference Para 133 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942, in which it was reported that the price of sovereigns on the 15th July was fairly steady at Fs 59-60. Between July 15th and July 20th the price rose slight ly to Rs 60/8/-. On July 21st it fell sharply to Rs57 owing to an order issued by the Political Agent directing that bullion brokers must produce before him every week a statement giving details of all their transactions in gold. ^fhen the first. shock caused by this order had worn off the price of sovereigns again began to rise but had not, by the end of the month, gone above Rs 60 . The' chief bullion brokers in Bahrain are Iraqi Jews. They are chary of taking the risk of smuggling gold out of Bah rain as they know that detection would involve their-3- deportation from the island. They have therefore been adopting the less dangerous and only slightly less P rof ?; ta J lG selling sovereigns to Kuwaiti brokers and merchants in Bahrain (which is* of course, no offence), and the of smuggling the gold out of the island. T ^ G + Po J; lt ^®l * recent order will enable some kind of a check to be kept local movements of gold, and the activities of Kuwaitis purehas ing gold will, in future, be watched closely by the police. It is not expected that the order now passed will finally put an end to the smuggling of g 0 l d + frG ?J. Beih ^J^ it will make smuggling more difficult, and to this extent it constitutes a useful move in the game of financial fox and geese which the Political authorities have for many months been playing with Kuwaiti, Basrawi and Bahraini bullion brokers. The greater skill of the brokers in playing this game is balanced by the authority which Political Agents baVG J? G al the rules; and so far neither side has scored a decisive advantage. (ii) Reference para 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942 in which it was reported that Saudi Riyals in Qatif were at a premium of Rs 50-60 per thousand. The premium has now risen to Rs 85 per thousand riyals. The supply of riyals is short, and the demand rinp KUwait^continues. The shortage of supply is believed to be due largely to hoarding which, actuated primarily desire to hold wealth in tangible form, has recently been stimulated by rumours that the Saudi Government are contemplating the of currency notes. (iii) Reference para 118(ii) of Intelligence Summary No.12 ° f 1942 ' Currency notes at Dubai and Sharjah are now at a dis- count of only 2j%. The reduction in the premium on rupees is due to the arrival of further consignments of rupees from India, 150. Alarms . On the evening of July 19th information was received n-r the presence in the Persian Gulf of a suspicious ship, me Naval and Air Force authorities took requisite .P^ eG ^^itions measures, and the Defence Officer ® ad °®PP r0 P^ a ship which had nf all available troops, guns and guards. The smp.wnicn roused suspicion was located off Bahrain on the morning of July 20th. After its bona fides hs^'ieen established troops and guards returned to their normal stations. , nd mentl set in train by the Defence Officer worked smoothly, and Bahrain Petroleum Company officials gave ready co-operation. 151.

Reference para 119 of Intelligence Summary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that Dohah, the ca^i a o Q , was being used as an entrepot in the slave traffic. / Information-4- I Information has been received from a source believed , \ to be reliable that in June the Shaikh of Qatar sent to Nejd, &gt; \ in the charge of his servant Abdullah bin Gaanim al Hajiri, twenty slaves as a gift for Ibn Saud. Five of the slaves were 1 women, young and unmarried, and fifteen were men. He slso sent two male slaves and two female slaves as a present to bin Jaluwi. It is reported that these slaves had been for a considerable time in Dohah before they made the journey to Nejd. The chief slave brokers in Dohah are stated to be Ershaid Nejdi and bin Athemin. It is probable that the slave traffic has also the connivance, if not the active support, of Shaikh Saleh al Mana, the Shaikh of Qatar’s secretary and confidant. • In the first week of July, immediately after the Political /igent 1 s visit to Qatar, the Shaikh of Qatar issued a proclamation, copies of which were posted prominently in the Dohah bazaars, forbidding the export of slaves from Qatar territory. The mere fact that such a notice was issued appears to confirm the belief that Dohah had become, or was becoming, a recognised slave mart. 153. The Oil Companies . (i) On the 21st July the Political Agent authorised the transmission to Dhahran by radio telephone of an urgent message giving the result of a blood test. The man whose blood-sample had been sent to Bahrain for analysis was an employee of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company who was lying seriously ill in the hospital at Dhahran. This is the second occasion since June 11th, when R/T communication was first established between Bahrain and the mainland, that the service has proved useful in emergency. (ii) Reference para 136(1) of Intelligence Summary No.13 of 1942 in which it was reported that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company hoped to obtain the use of a Pan American Airways machine to transport discharged personnel to the U.S.A. A Pan American Airways machine, duly authorised by the U.S. Middle East Ferry Command, arrived at Bahrain^on July 17th and left the following day en route to Cairo carrying as passengers 19 California Arabian Standard Oil Company and 4 Bahrain Petroleum Company employees. 154.

Movements of Officials * The Political Agent and Captain Dixon circumnavigated Bahrain Island on June 19th. The journey, which was performed in the Bahrain Government's Police launch, took just over twelve hours. 114. Notable Visitors . Generals Brereton, Alexander and Adler arrived in Bahrain by air from India on June 26th and left in a Westerly direction on June 27th. Their night's stay in Bahrain was involuntary, being caused by weather conditions. 115. Royal Air Force Levies. Reference para 84 of Intelligence Summary No.lONof 1942 in which doubt was expressed whether the full number of recruits required at Dubai and Sharjah would be forthcoming. At Dubai 104 of the 120 men required have been en listed and the O.C. Levies expects to recruit the balance within a week or ten days. At Sharjah only 52 of the 240 men required have been enlisted, and it will obviously be necesdary to open the ranks of the Sharjah' Levies to recruits from Dubai. 116. Defence . During the period under report military forces in Bahrain received a very considerable accession to their strength. The Bahrain Government have been consistently helpful in placing at the disposal of the various Services land, builds ings etc. required for Defence purposes. 117. Air Raid Alarm . At about 2.15 pun. on June 21st a 'Red' Air Raid warning was received from Basrah. The Bahrain Petroleum Company was immediately informed, and precautionary measures were taken. The 'All Clear' was received half an hour later. In the meantime, however, unnecessary corifusion had been caused owing to the receipt by the Naval Base of a telephone message, sent by an unknown person at Awali, to the effect that a bomb had been dropped oh the Refinery. The author of this message has not been traced, and it cannot therefore be ascertained whether it was due to deliberate knavery, to a perverted sense of humour, or merely to hysteria. Regarded as an exercise, the Air Raid warning was /useful in that it brought to notice a number of imperfections in existing A.R.P. arrangements. Bazaar speculation about the reason for the warning was as varied and imaginative as one would expect in Bahrain 5 but it is of interest that gossips and rumour-mongers unanimously placed the danger in the East, from the Japanese, rather than in the North or West, from the Germans. Economic. TT 7 Food Supplies . Reference para 103 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that the position arising out / of- 2 - of the bread famine had become really serious* Public unrest was allayed by two measures - (i) The margin of profit allowed to merchants by the Food Controller on imports of rice and flour was doubled* Merchants inwiediate- ly placed large orders with their Agents in India for the supply of these commodities; and the news that these orders had been placed gave the public confidence that supplies of flour would soon arrive in Bahrain. (ii) A system of Card rationing for rice, flour and sugar was introduced. The introduction of rationing for flour suggested, more forcibly than any vague assurances, that flour would soon be available again in the market. By the 20th June discontent among the Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company at their alleged * starvation' was becoming dangerously unanimous. The Company, therefore, arranged for the issue of bread to any of their Indian employ ees wishing to purchase it. The price was reasonable, but the quantity which any individual was permitted to buy was strictly limited. The Company only had a small amount of flour avail able - the amount required for consumption by Staff Personnel and their families over a period of six months - but accepted the assurance given by the Political Agent that it would be un necessary for them to continue the concession for more than ten days or a fortnight. Before the end of the period under report 715 bags of wheat flour (representing rather less than a fortnight's normal consumption) had been imported into Bahrain, and the flour situation became temporarily easier. The Six weeks' flour famine caused real distress among the poorest members of the. community. Indians also felt the lack of flour, though their want was not as sharp as the voices which they raised in pro test. H.H. the Shaikh, in discussing the situation with the Political Agent, referred, shrewdly enough, to the thirst which a traveller feels when he knows that water is short. (ii) Currency . , . ^ „ n Reference para 103 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that in the first week of June currency notes had depreciated so much at Dubai and Sharjah that they were quoted at a discount of four annas in the rupee. Currency notes at ikibai and Sharjah are still at a discount, but only of one anna in the rupee. The improvement^ in the situation is reported to be due to the arrival in Dubai of a consignment of Fs 40,000 in cash, imported by a Hindu mer chant. Another Rs 50,000 is said to be on its way to Dubai from India. 119. Slave Traffic . Reports have been received from various sources that slaves are being imported into Qatar from the Persian coas for sale to Nejdi slave traffickers. H.H. the Shaikh (who is an unreliable informant where Qatar affairs are concerned; told the Political Agent that Persian girls could be bought in Qatar for as little as Bs 15 or 20. It is known, of course, that whole families on the Persian Coast are in a state oi tion; and the story goes that the Nakhodas of Persian dhows, with plausible tales of the good conditions ex i s ^S ™L pn Arab side of the Gulf, persuade parents to send their childre in their care to the land of plenty across the sea. Jhen tnese parties of children and young adults arrive on ^ he Arab side of the Gulf, they are sold like sheep or goats to the hignes bidder. After meking due allowance for the inevitable element/ 124. -3- of exaggeration, there remains a sufficient corpus of evidence to suggest that Dohah, the capital of Qatar, is being, or at least has been, used as an entrepot in this sickening traffic, a 120# The Shaikh of Fu.iairah , Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad al Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujai rah, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th June and called on the Political Agent on the 29th, He gave expression to strong pro-British sentiments, and declared his readiness to assist the British Government in any and every way open to him. The Political Agent, in thanking him for these sentiments, referred with appreciation to the Shaikh’s action in making Mirza bin Barkat and his family remove themselves from his territory. Mirza bin Barkat, it will be recalled, is the freebooter and slave trader whose piracies caused so much alarm last winter among the owners of sea-going dhows, both Arab and Persian. The Shaikh of Fujairah appears to be a young man of parts, lively and with a quick intelligence. 121, Supplies for Saudi Arabia , 122. Smuggling of Arms . (i) Bahrain . From time to time reports are received that arms have been, or are going to be, smuggled out of Bahrain. No seizures have yet been made though suspected dhows have been searched after they have cleared the harbour and have set sail for the Persian coast. (ii) Shar.iah . A seizure of ten smuggled rifles was recently made at Sharjah. All the rifles were old. The smugglers are also alleged to have committed two murders in the course of an adventurous career extending over the last two months, the details of which are still under investigation. Smuggling of Gold. (i) On the 17th June the Political Agent received informa tion from a private source that gold had been smuggled out of Bahrain on S.S. Barpeta bound for Kuwait and Basrah. The author ities at those ports were requested to take special preventive steps; and on the 20th June a telegram was received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, reporting that 200 sovereigns had been found on a passenger alighting there. The gold was contained in a package which showed the consignor to be Haji Mohammed Tahir Khunji, a well-known Bahrain merchant of Persian nation ality, (ii) On the 23rd June a launch bound for Kuwait, on which a number of Kuwaiti merchants were travelling, was intercepted by the Bahrain Police off Jedda Island and thoroughly searched. No gold was found, but the passengers (who included a suspicious looking ’guide’ from the Hedjaz) were detained as they we J e carrying uncensored letters. The most interesting item of the launch’s cargo was a sack contain ing Es 50,000 in currency notes, 123* (i) Large shipments of food supplies, marked ’U.K.C.C.' end consigned to Has Tanura, have been received by Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company, Bahrain. (ii) Saudi Arabian Government officials recently told the Personnel Manager of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company that the Saudi Arabian Government had been given an opportunity a short time ago of buying large supplies of rice from Egypt. .The offer had been refused as adequate supplies of rice were \already being obtained from India and, in any case, people in ^Saudi Arabia did not like Egyptian rice.124* The Oil Companies. (i) Reference parn 109 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that direct radio telephonic communication between Bahrain and Dhahran began on the 11th June. The usefulness to the Services of this of AiiAo connec tion was given convincing demonstration when, on the 16th June, a Royal Air Force machine was compelled to make a forced land ing on Tarut Island (South of Ras Tanura). Owing to the facili ties now available for direct communication with the mainland, help was immediately forthcoming. (ii) Reference para 109 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which it was reported that the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s production of oil had been reduced from 18,000 to 15,000 barrels per day. By the end of the period undeai report nine of the fif teen separate units comprised in the Refinery had been shut down, and the Company propose, during the next fortnight, to dispense with the services of no less than 400 Bahraini employees. At the end of a month, unless the position improves in the mean time, another 200 Bahraini employees will be discharged. The reasons put forward by the Company for the partial closure of the Refinery are being separately reported. 125. Local Affairs . (i)' Reference para 106 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942. ^ The prostitutes’ strike is now over, and Bahrainis . have resumed their normal social activities. (ii) Reference para 106(ii) of Intelligence Summary No.11 of 1942 in which an account was given of the jealous rivalry between Shias and Sunnia in making collections for their res pective ”Relief of the Poor” Funds. The original Arab Committee, which invited subscrip tions only from Arabs, Sunni Persians and Indians, has now collected Rs 22,000. The Baharina and Shia Persians have collected some Rs 10,000. Members of the A1 Khalifah have sub scribed to both Funds, and so also has the Bahraih Petroleum Company - the latter to the extent of Rs 1,500/-. • 3.26. Suicide . On June 26th a Danish officer, an Engineer, committed suicide on board a Cable ship lying off Bahrain. The Assistant Political Agent held an inquest on the following day, after which the corpse was buried at sea. The cause of death is not definitely known, but may well have been due to climatic con ditions. 127. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 103.4° on 19th June Minimum temperature 79.0 on 16th and 17th June. Humidity exceeded 70% on four days, the maximum being 82% on 25th June. During the period under report the Bahrain climate more than justified the reputation accorded to it by a former Political Agent who described it as ’’One of the foulest climates in the world”. Sd.

From May 9th to May 18th, and from May 25th to June 12th, the Political Agent had no British officer to assist him. Between June 1st and June 6th, owing to Dr. Siddiq’s absence in Qatar, he had no assistance of any kind. The burden of work during these periods was very great. 98. Royal Visit.■ - 2 - 98* Royal Visit . At 5.0 p.m. on June 6th H.R.Ho the Duke of Glouces ter arrived at Muharraq aerodrome having flown from Lydda. He was met by the Political Agent who presented to him H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain and his two uncles, Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, Mr. Belgrave, and the senior officers of the three Services present in Bahrain. After inspecting a Guard of Honour of the State Police His Royal Highness drove to the Agency with H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent. Later in the evening His Royal Highness, who was wearing the uniform of a Major General, visited H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain at his Manama Palace. During the visit, which lasted for some twenty minutes, the Duke of Gloucester informed His Highness that he / would shortly receive a present from the British Government of two captured 105 millimetre Italian guns. Shaikh Salman, who was genuinely delighted at this announcement, presented His Royal Highness with some pearls and with a sword, encased in a gold scabbard, v/hich had been in the possession of the Al.Khali- fah for many generations. His Royal Highness spent the night at the Agency and left for Karachi the following morning. H.H. Shaikh Salman and his uncles went to the aerodrome to see him off. His Royal Highness : visit was, in prospect, a source of pride to H.H. Shaikh Salman. In retrospect it has been to him a spring of unbounded exaltation and delight. The warmth of friendship with which Shaikh Salman welcomed his Royal guest was matched only by the graciousness of its response^ and the ties which bind the Ruling Family of Bahrain to the British Crown have been sensibly strengthened by the contact now made. 99. Other visitors . (i) Mr. Twitchell and two other members of the.United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia arrived in Bahrain on June 6th for a short Visit. (ii) Mr.H.S. Bowlby, the_Petroleum Department’s represent ative at Baghdad, “arrived on June 8th. He left on June 12th having visited in the meantime the California Arabian Standard Oil Company camp on the mainland. / (iii) Sir Archibald Carter passed through Bahrain on June ( 6th on the Westbound Flying-boat. (iv) On June 15th Sir Edward Villiers passed through Bahrain on the Eastbound Flying-boat. Sir Reginald Dorman Smith and Air Chief Marshall Sir Ludlow Hewitt passed through on the Westbound Flying-boat. 100. Royal Air Force . Reference para 83 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that the new emergency landing grounds on the coast of Saudi Arabia between Dhahran and Kuwai were likely to be ready for use within a week. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company intimated on June 3rd that the marking of the landing grounds had been completed and that they were ready for inspection. On June 12th the Air Liaison Officer Bahrain carried out an inspection and, after landing on each of the four aerodromes, was able o report that they were fit for use. 101. Missing Aircra ft. Reference para 85 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that a.Boston aircrait bound for Shaibah had 7ist been heard of 50 miles North of Bahrain on the morning of May 31 3 t and that no further trace of it had been discovered. / Q-3- On June 7th the California Arabian Standard Oil Company reported that a fisherman, who was believed to be reliable, had stated that shortly before noon on May 31st he had seen a large aeroplane disappear into the sea. In the absence of any other information there seemed no reason to deny credit to this story, and the worst fears were entertained for the safety of the crew. However, on the evening of June 10th a telegram was received from the Political Resident at Bushire intimating that a message had arrived from the crew of the missing machine to say that they were all safe though their machine was wrecked, that they were stranded at Tahiri, a place on the Persian coast 135 miles South-East of Bushire, and that they would like trans port arranged for them. This dramatic message, written on June 1st, had been taken overland to Bushire by runner. At 4.0 a.m. on June 11th, under orders received from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, a naval vessel left for Tahiri; and later the same morning an aircraft (a Blenheim) set off with medical stores, food, clothing, cigarettes and a bundle of Persian currency notes to the value of 5000 riyals. The aircraft duly sighted the missing men and dropped the stores and money to them - dropped also a message that help was on the way and that a ship would arrive next morning to take them off. The account of their adventures given to the Political Agent by the rescued crew of the aircraft contained many fea tures of interest. They landed on a stretch of sand uncovered by the tide (which was fortunately low at the time) some four miles South-East of Barak. Having established their location on a map, they set off in the evening to walk to Kangan. At Barak they were met by the local Shaikh, Canaan Nasouri, who gave them food, bedding and shelter. They stayed the night at Barak, hoping to get donkeys to take them on their way the following morning. The next day, June 1st, having returned to the aircraft, which had been partly submerged by the sea, and having salvaged certain equipment from it, they made their way to Tahiri whose Customs Officer, Sadruddin Suddedor, had sent donkeys to bring them there. At^Tahiri they were told that it would take them a fortnight to make their way to Bushire. overland (a strong North wind made travelling by sea impossible) while a messenger could complete the journey within a week. , Accordingly they decided to send a messenger to Bushire while they themselves remained at Tahiri as guests of the Customs Officer, who was of a most friendly disposition and seemed genuinely anxious to extend his hospitality to them. During their enforced stay at Tahiri they were most . hospitably treated. Food in the village was by no means plenti ful, but the airmen were given as much as they wanted - eggs and bread for breakfast, rice and side dishes of meat, soup, dates etc. in the middle of the day and in the evening. Xh® Customs offic.er who provided this fare could not do enough lor his guests, I was told. He had been educated at the American \ Mission School at Kirmanshah, and asserted that he was °nly too glad to repay to English speaking people something of the kindness he had received from them as a boy. To the very end j he refused to accept any payment for himself; eventually, \ after the rescue party had arrived, the interpreter on the naval vessel persuaded him to accept 1500 Riyals (he would not take more) for distribution among the poor of his village. The friendliness with which the airmen were treated by every one was most marked. During the period of their stay the Shaikh of.Barak and his followers were prosecuting a feud with their neigh bours to the South. Raiding parties went out almost daily, and in the course of the operations three of the Shaikh s men were killed. The airmen examined many of the rifles used, / They-4- They were of Russian or German manufacture, all of them old- The newest rifle they saw was a German Mauser made in 1917 0 4 • They also noticed a steady trickle of travellers making their way North, sometimes in ones and twos, sometimes a dozen or fifteen at a time. They were told that these were men making their way to Abadan in search of work. Sometimes crowded dhows would also be seen hugging the coast and making their way North; but generally the weather made sea travel impracticable. The two things which made the deepest impression on the airmen were (i) the extraordinarily friendly way in v/hich everyone, and especially the Customs Officer at Tahiri, treat ed them, and (ii; the remarkable accuracy with which the Blen heim dropped their bundles of food etc., one after another, practically at their feet. 102. Defence• Many thousands of tons of coral are being provided by local labour every month, partly for P.A.D. works at Awali and partly for the soling of a large area of soft ground which divides the Civil from the R.A.F. aerodrome at Muharraq. The coral is cut from the sea shore when the tide is low, is load ed into small boats and is dumped at the nearest convenient pier or jetty. The progress of the works at Awali and Muharraq is limited not by the supply of coral available, which is in exhaustible, nor by shortage of labour, of which there is plenty, but by the number of small boats available for use in transporting the coral from sea to land. A ’trial order’ has now been received from Basrah for 10,000 tons of coral to be delivered within a month. -Acceptance of the order would give much-needed local employment; but it is doubtful whether there is a sufficient number of small boats available to enable so large a requisition to be fulfilled without interfering, with the progress of local works. The question is being given careful thought. 103. Economic. (i) Food Su p plies . Reference para 87 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.xO of 1942 in which it was reported that the question of food supplies in Bahrain was causing increasing anxiety, and that the temporary shortage of flour was developing into a chronic bfead famine. ©&gt; sT No wheat or flour was imported into Bahrain during the period under review in spite of the fact that licences for the export of flour from India had been granted to Bahrain merchants. In fact, four successive weeks have passed without a single bag of flour arriving at Bahrain. The position has now become really serious. Every day crowds demonstrate out side the Customs House; Indian employees of the Bahrain Pet roleum Company are becoming disaffected and complain that, if they are compelled to remain in Bahrain, at least provision should be made to feed them; and the feelings of.the local populace are exacerbated beyond measure when, seeing bags off-loaded from ships calling at Bahrain, they discover that they are filled with pepper or chillis, cardamom or turmeric, copra or nuts or ginger - with everything, in fact, except the flour which is so desperately needed. The Shaikh of Bah rain is pressing the Political Agent hard to alter the basis of price control in such a manner as to allow local merchr.nts double their present margin of profit, in order that they.can obtain by bribery at Karachi the facilities which are denied to those who, for whatever reasons, are compelled.to follow ithe path of rectitude. The Political Agent r s resistance to the Shaikh’s pressure is weakening, as he cannot refute the / propositionproposition that some wheat in Bahrain at a high price is better than none at any price. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, realising that their operations are likely to be adversely affected if their em ployees cannot obtain essential foodstuffs, have offered to place all surplus space on their tankers at the disposal of the Bahrain Government for the transport of foodstuffs. The offer has been gratefully accepted. (ii) Currency . Reference para 87 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that Indian currency notes at Dubai and Sharjah were at a discount of two annas in the rupee. Early in the period under report the value of currency notes depreciated still further, and they were quoted at a discount of four annas in the rupee. No news of more recent developments has yet been received. 104. The Shaikh of Dubai . Reference para 88 of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which an account was given of the somewhat cold welcome accorded by the A1 Khalifah to Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, on his visit to Bahrain. Shaikh Said left Bahrain by launch for Qatar on June 14th. The Political Agent was glad to see the last of him, not on any personal grounds, but because his presence in Bah rain was a fertile source of embarrassment to everyone con cerned. After news of the Duke of Gloucester's proposed visit to Bahrain had been received, little time elapsed before H.H. Shaikh Salman expressed very forcibly to the Adviser the opinion that Shaikh Said should not be allowed to push himself into the picture 0 , in Dubai he could do what he liked, but in Bahrain he was a visitor and ought to take a back seat. Shortly after this had been retailed to the Political Agent,. that unfortunate officer received a written request from Shaikh Said asking that he might be informed of the time of the Duke of Gloucester's arrival in order that he might pay his respects to him. 'Whatever course the Political Agent took seemed likely to cause offence to one of the two Shaikhs though it was obviously undesirable that the Royal visit should be the occasion of heart-burning to either of them. Eventually the Political Agent approached Shaikh Salman with a request for a little private advices The Shaikh of Dubai was only a visitor to Bahrain but naturally would like an opportunity of being presented to the Duke° would His Highness prefer that Shaikh Said should be presented to the Duke on the latter’s arrival at the aerodrome, or that he should be granted a private audience with the Duke at the Agency later in the day? Shaikh Salman, full of apprehension lest the latter alternative should be adopted, earnestly advocated adoption of the former suggestion, and himself volunteered to take Shaikh Said with him to the aerodrome. So the difficulty was resolved with satisfaction to all concerned. 105. Small Pox. Reference para 89 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that there had been an un usually extensive outbreak of smallpox in Bahrain. 20,000 people in the island have been vaccinated. Vaccination has been compulsory in respect of masters and boys of Government schools, personnel of Government offices, barber bakers and coffee-shop owners, Police and Defence personnel, / and/ 109 . - 6 - and persons entering or leaving the island. Facilities at the quarantine centre on Muharraq Island have been improved and this institution is now being run smoothly and efficiently by the Agency doctor. The State Medical Department take the view that the increase in the incidence of smallpox this year is,apparent rather than real. They say that the epidemic has probably been, in fact, only of normal proportions but that it seems to have been more extensive because so many cases have been exposed and treated. In the past many cases were concealed, and people died from smallpox without the death being reported or its cause diagnosed. 106. Local Affairs . (i) Reference para 90 (i) of Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1942 in which it was reported that the prostitutes of Manama had threatened either to emigrate to Kuwait or to go on strike. In the end they adopted the latter alternative. But idleness is irksome to people who love their work, and already the ranks of blacklegs are nightly receiving fresh recruits. (ii) In order to provide relief for the poor of Bahrain a committee of Arabs was recently formed under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa to collect money in Manama and Muharraq. About Fs 11,000/- has already been collected from Arabs, Sunni Persians and Indians. No collections were made from the Shia community nor were Shias invited to join the committee. This exclusion of the Shias was insisted on by the Fakhroo family, who gave generously to the fund, and by Khaleel Kanoo, who was active in collecting money but less active in giving it. The Shias have felt bitterly their exclusion from participation in this philanthropic undertaking and complain that this is the first occasion for maffiy years that a deliberate and definite distinction has been made bet ween Shias and other Arabs. They asked the Adviser whether there was any objection to their organising similar measures among their own community. They were told that there was no objection and that in the matter of affording help the.Bahrain Government would.treat Sunnis and Shias alike. The.Shias have now collected some Fs 7,000/- and both communities are en deavouring to collect mohe subscriptions. The stimulus to their activities has become political and communal jealousy rather than philanthropy. The Shias were so incensed at the attitude adopted towards them by the Sunni Community that^they threatened to resign en bloc from all public bodies. It is un likely, however, that they will carry out their threat. It may be added that there is a considerable amount .{of destitution in Bahrain. The date crop is not yet ripe and bread is unobtainable so the poorest members of the community have difficulty in avoiding starvation. 107. Public Relations . On the 3rd June Mr. Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer, gave a most successful evening party for the Shaikh of Dubai. Guests included the Political Agent and leading members of the mercantile community. After dinner war films were shown. These included many pictures^of heavy bombers and the factories where they are made. Since news of the R.A.F.’s gigantic raids on Essen and Cologne had just been received the pictures shown aroused the greatest interest. 108. Bahrain Government . t. On June iSth? Dr. Doeg arrived in Bahrain. She has been appointed Lady Medical Officer to the Bahrain Government.-7- 109. The Oil Companies . (i) Direct radio telephonic communication between Bahrain and Dhahran began on the 11th June. Institution of the service was delayed for nearly a month while the renewed sanction of the Saudi Arabian Government was obtained. (ii) Since May 2nd the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s daily production of oil has been reduced from 18,000 to 15,000 barrels per day. The reason for the reduction is not known. (iii) Mr. Rodstrom, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company’s popular and efficient representative in Bahrain,^has handed over charge of his iuties to Mr,Reynolds prior to his departure to the United St vtes on vacation. 110 &lt;• Alarms and Excursions . (i) Wild rumours were circulated in European^circles as the result of a casual remark by the pilot of an aircraft visiting Bahrain that he had seen off Sitra what appeared to be a submarine. The '•submarine' turned out to be the tanker 'CaItex II”o (ii) Considerable local excitement was caused by the dis covery at Budaiya of what was believed to be a bomb. Investi gation showed the bomb to be a smoke float released by some passing aircraft. A smoke float undoubtedly resembles a bomb in shape and appearance but in weight it is, of course, very different. 111. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 98.7 0 on 15th June. Minimum temperature 75.0 on 15th.June. Humidity exceeded 70% on 2 days the maximum being 80% on 14th June, A North wind blew throughout most of the period under report. Towards the end of the period, however, the wind died away completely, leaving in its place a hot and humid vacuum. Sd. E„B e Wakefield.

There was an increasing shortage of both wheat and rice, the latter being largely due to small imports from India where export permits could only be obtained by heavy bribery. Indian currency notes were at a 12i% discount at Dubai and Sharjah. In paragraph 87(2) the Political Agent gives reasons for this high rate;and suggests, as a remedy, that both the R.A.F. and the B.O.A.C* should make all their payments in cash.£ Bahrein and Q^atar. The supposition that the reason for the tightening of restrictions on the entry of Qatari/2 * ~ ; .t Qatari into Bahrein was to provide an opportunity for the re-opening of the Zubara question, had been confirmed. The point of view of Shaikh Salman,as given by him to the Political Agent,will be found in paragraph 91• *1 Oil Companies .

This is pabtly due to the increase in rice consumption whicn has resulted from the shortage of flour, but is mainly due to the fact that for over two months the amount of rice imported from India has been negligible. local.merchants state shat, since the time when the e:rpcrt from India oi rice, flour e ^ c * was restricted to persons holding export permits, they have been unable to bring to Bahrain the.stocks which they have purchased in Karachi. Export permits are obtainable - only on payment of large bribes to xne c..ericastaff of the Export Control authorities 5 and Banram merchants are unable to P afford bribes on the scale demanded ou. of the 10 % margin of profit which local Price Control allows 10 them. The mer chants have accordingly asked either that export permits may be granted by the Political Agent, Bahrain, or that the margi of profit allowed to them may oe increased to^ The former suggestion could presumably oe entertained only if and gy ‘ export quotas for Bahrain have been fixed; the.ter sugges tion, which involves acceptance c_ the proposition that people of Bahrain should pay more for their rice or flour because oertain Indian clerks are corrupt, will only be given consideration if the position deteriorates^still further. (ii) Currency ; At Dubai and Sharjah Indian currency notes ~ / ar qnow at a discount of two annas in the rupee, i.e. It is normal for notes to be at a slight discount during the diving season when there is a steady demand for rupee coins with which to pay divers their advances; but the rate of discount has never before exceeded 4%, and it is difficult to assess with certainty the relative weight of the various factors which have contributed to bring about the present unfortunate situation The main factors are almost certainly five, of which two may be said to be normal and three abnormal, j-he normal factors are ( 1 ) the seasonal shortage of rupees caused by the advances made to divers and (2) the fact that Bedouin from the hinterland of the Trucial Coast insist on payment in rupees for the feuns, goats, sheep, butter etc which they bring for sale in the^Dubai or Sharjah markets. The abnormal fac tors are (i) the ban on the export of rupee coins from^India and Bahrain (2) the general feeling of insecurity and instab ility caused by the War which leads people to prefer generally to keep, whether for hoarding or for use,^ a coin which has some intrinsic value rather than a ncoe wnich has none^CB) the fact that very large sums of money are being paid out in notes in Sharjah and Dubai by the R.A.Fo The number of notes in local circulation has therefore increased enormously in rela tion to the number of coins in circulation, with the inevitable consequence that the value of notes lias iatlen as against the value of coins. Local merchants have raised their prices to customers who pay in notes. iiocally employed staff o-^ ^he British Over seas Airways Corporation are therefore refusing to accept pay ment of their wages in notes, and R.A.Fc personnel or employees can legitimately complain that, as long as they are paid in notes, they are not receiving the full value of their salary. The position will deteriorate further unless immediate steps are taken to increase the proportion of coins to notes in lo cal circulation. As there are no Banks at Dubai or Sharjah, the simplest method of bring:.ng about tne desired resuj-t is for the R,A.F. and the BoO.AoC. to make all payments in cash. Both the R.A.F. and the B.O.A.C. have means at their disposal to bring coins from India by air, and they are being advised to adopt this course. If they do adopt this course it is probable that in four months' time, when the diving season comes to an end and when the influx of rupee coino has made itself felt, the balance between the value of notes and coins will be restored. The Shaikh of Dubai. Shaikh Said bin Maktum. Ruler of Dubai, accompanied by his nephew, Obaid bin Juma, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th May with the professed object of condoling with the A1 KnaiJ--* fah on the death of Shaikh Kamad and of congratulating Snaikh Salman on his succession. The present Shaikh of Dubai has never been regarded by the Bahrain Shaikhs with anything but disapproval and miid contempts But during the last eighteen months, since ^haikh Mana’ of Dubai has been residing in Bahrain as a political refugee, Shaikh Said's stock has fallen still further as Shaikh Mana 1 has been consistently spreading malicious ^oss-.p about him. It has been interesting,therefore, to watcn action and reaction during Shaikh Said’S visit. The A1 Khalifah have criticised adversely avery ac tion of Shaikh Said’s since his arrival. After Shaikh Muham mad bin Isa had called on Shaikh Said on his launch, he com plained that he had been grossly insulted; he nad not hoen handed coffee first, and he had been given a less honourable seat than he considered his due. Shaikn oalman states that Shaikh Said, when calling on him, entirely ence to Shaikh Hamad's death, and he further a-leges (not, I^5^ think, without seme truth) that the real object of Shaikh Said’s visit to Bahrain was to purchase motor cars and spare parts which he could not obtain anywhere else. It is true ^ that Shaikh Said has purchased motor cars and spare parts in Bahrain; but he was able to do so only after the Political Agent had engaged on his behalf in a hectic diplomatic duel with Shaikh Salman, who had sent orders to his Adviser that Shaikh Said must not be allowed to make any purchases in the bazaar for export to Dubai. Shaikh Du’aij bin Hamad took clever advantage of the situations He pleased the Political Agent by allowing his car to be sold to Shaikh Said; and he pleased Shaikh Salman by extorting from Shaikh Said twice the price which had been paid for the car when it was newt Shaikh Said of Dubai intends to leave Bahrain on the 5th or 6 th June. The A1 Khalifah are too well-mannered to permit signs of their hostility to Shaikh Said to appear openly, but his visit will leave them with a good stock of material for pleasantly maliciouslanecdote= When the atmosphere has grown less electric the Political Agent proposes to remind Shaikh Salman that, in the dispute between Shaikh Said bin Maktum and Shaikh^Mana, the sympathies of Ibn Saud were wholly with Shaikh Said. 89. S mall pox and typhus . (i) Dubai has now been declared free from small pox. (ii) There is an unusually extensive outbreak of small pox in Bahrain, but deaths have been comparatively few. (iii) Three cases of typhus (one fatal) have been reported from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company camp at Dhahran. 90. Local Affairs . (i) Reference para 76 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.9 of 1942 in which it was reported that steps were being taken by the Bahrain Government to restrict the activities of pros titutes to certain specified quarters. The prostituted of Manama resent Government inter ference with their trade, and have threatened that, if.the restrictions recently enforced are not removed, they will either (a) emigrate to Kuwait or (b) go on strike. The junior members of the A1 Khalifah are greatly worried by the situation which has now developed. (ii) A play performed by the boys of the Manama Secondary school raised Rs 2001, which has been presented to the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. 91. Bahrain and Qatar . Reference para 63 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No .8 of 1942 in which it was reported that the reason for the Shaikh of Bahrain's action in tightening up the restrictions on the entry into Bahrain of subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar might be to provide an opportunity for the re-opening of the Zubara question. It is now possible to confirm this conjecture. At an interview with the Political Agent on May 24th H.H. the Shaikh related at length the whole history of Zubara (as seen through Bahrain eyes), and enumerated the.advantages which would accrue to the Shiakh of Qatar if friendljy relations between the two Sheikhdoms could be resumed. The Shaikh ot Bahrain is not prepared to give up his claim.to sovereignty over Zubara. and it is possible that the Shaikh of Qatar / will- 6 - will still insist, as in the past, on the relinquishment of that claim as a sine qua non of any agreement. If the two Shaikhs wou^d only agree to differ over the question of sov ereignty it looks as if there would be little difficulty in bringing about a compromise in regard to other disputed matters. The impression which the Political Agent derived from his discussion with Shaikh Salman was that he is gen uinely anxious for a settlement of the dispute, but that he is unwilling to take the first step towards a reconciliation and will, in any case, decline absolutely to renounce the claim of the A1 Khalifah to the Zubara district. In the course of the conversation H.H. stated, and subsequently repeated, that members of the Naim and other tribes who had formerly lived in Zubara and owed allegiance to the Ruler of Bahrain were now dispersed through Saudi Arabia; but that Ibn Baud, as a gesture of sympathy, allowed goods from Bahrain to pass to them through Saudi Arabian ports free of Customs duty. When these tribesmen lived in Zubara they paid no Customs duty on goods imported from Bah rain, for Zubara was regarded as Bahrain territory; and now the exemption which was their right in Zubara has been con tinued to them in Saudi Arabia as a special privelege. 92. Persia . About conditions in Persia, many stories, which there are no means of verifying, are brought to Bahrain by.the crews of Persian dhows. Among such stories recently retailed are that the Director of Customs at Hasinah was killed a short time ago by raiding Tarakama tribesmen; and that Buir Ahmedi tribesmen recently attacked the Persian military garri son at Dilum (a small port on the Hindiyan coast), killed the officers and men stationed there, and cut the cable. 93• The Oil Companies . (i) Dr. Kennedy, formerly Medical Officer, Bahrain Pet roleum Company, went to the United States on leave a few weeks ago. He has now decided not to return to Bahrain. His place will, it is believed, be taken by Dr. Storm, formerly of the Amierican Mission at Bahrain. (ii) Reference para 78 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.9 of 1942 in which were reported initial reactions of Oil Com pany employees to the measures of Industrial Conscription in troduced in the second week of May. It is confirmed that European and Canadian British subjects have accepted the measure with equanimity. Indeed, the measure has been welcomed by the majority of the^members of the European and Canadian communities who now feel (what they wanted to feel) that their work is of great importance in relation to the War. They only had one small complain to make on a matter arising out of the terms of the Regulation, and that matter was adjusted without difficulty thanks to the cooperation of the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. ( Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company are not happy about the Regulation. They feel that they are trapped in Bahrain, with no means of escape from the fury of the enemy should it burst upon the island. Individual cases of recalcitrance are being dealt with on their merits by the Political Agent; But a large group of employees (clerical,. technical and artisan) have submitted a lengthy representation to the Political Resident in which they make all kinds ^un reasonable demands upon the Company which employs them, iheir chief complaint is that the treatment accorded to them by the Bahrain Petroleum Company is less favourable than the.treat ment accorded to their fellows by the Anglo Persian Oil Com pany. Apparently the latter Company have an Indian employee*. • -7- on Rs 800/- per mensem; and Indian employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company think that they should be paid on a similar scaleo copy of the representation has been forwarded to the Resident, but the Political /^gent 1 s comments will only follow when he has been able to master the feelings of im patience and disgust which spontaneously rise in him whenever he studies the revealing document. (iii) Reference para 64 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No .8 of 1942 in which were reported the reactions of ilmerican employ ees to the restrictions placed on their freedom to *&amp;eave Bah rain at will. The position has now been accepted by all and sundry. The Companies have been careful not to ask for per mits to leave Bahrain for employees whom they cannot replace, and several Americans are now being held until information is received that their reliefs have arrived at, or are on their way to, Bahrain. (iv) Over Rs 2000 was raised for War Charities by a perform ance of ,J Mro Pym passes by TJ staged at iAwali on the 14th and 16th May. 94. Abdul Karim Mahmud . During the period under report v/ere enacted further scenes in a drama on which the final curtain has not yet des cended. In the middle of February an Iraqi named Abdul Karim Mahmud landed at Dubai. The fact was reported to the British Embassy at Baghdad who intimated, a month later, that the man was wanted by the Basra police for complicity in a bomb conspir acy. For several weeks, while Abdul Karim was kept under close but unobtrusive surveillance at Dubai, the authorities concern ed discussed ways and means of arresting the wanted man and taking him to Basrah. Several plans were proposed, only to be rejected as impracticable or impolitic. The difficulties were many. There was no legal sanction for formal extradition; and informal extradition would constitute a breach of the sac red laws of Arab hospitality (for Abdul Karim was the guest of Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai). Means of transport ing Abdul Karim from Dubai to Basrah were also not readily available. Eventually it became imperative to take some kind of positive action as Abdul Karim was becoming restive and had expressed his intention of leaving Dubai in the-near future for Qatar and Saudi Arabia. When action was at last decided upon it was taken swiftly and effectively. On the 19th May the Commander of a small naval vessel called on the Politi cal Agent, and every aspect of the situation was discussed. At daybreak on May 21st the vessel arrived off Sharjah, and the Residency Agent went aboard b He arranged for the ship’s launch to lie off a deserted part of the beach betweem Shar jah and Hira. On receipt of a prearranged message Shaikh Rashid (son of the Ruler of Dubai) told Abdul Karim that the Residency Agent wanted to sed him urgently, and he was sent off in a taxi with a driver who had been told exactly where to take his passenger. Immediately after the taxi had left, Abdul Karim's belongings were rapidly bundled together and sent after him in a second taxi. Abdul Karim found the Residency Agent waiting for him on the beach. Their meeting was dramatic in the extreme, and Abdul Karim, when told that he was being sent back to Iraq, immediately demanded to see his host, the Shaikh of Dubai. This request was refused by the Residency- Agent, who wisely added that the Shaikh had nothing to do with the affair. Abdul Karim was abusive, but not violent; indeed, violence would have been of no avail since the Residency Agent was accompanied by two men armed with cudgels and a third armed with a rifle. Abdul Karim's final threat to the Residen cy Agent was forceful. r After four months' he said 'I shall come to this place when year masters are no longer in existence, and I shall then han(L you by the neck with hooks'. / Abdul4 » * * - 8 - Abdul Karim Mahmud was dolivered to the sure custody of H.M.’s Navy at 10.45 a*m« on the 21st May. After two more transfers, from ship to ship, he was handed over to the Basrah police on the 27th May. 95. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 106 on 31st May. Minimum temperature 75 on 20th May. Humidity exceeded 70% on 2 days the maximum being 74% on the 21st May. A North wind blew intermittently during the period under report, and the intervals of airless, humid heat were not unduly prolonged. Sd. E.B. Wakefield.

(v) The Shaikh of Ajman called on the Political^Agent on May 10th, He had flown from Dubai on a short visit to Bahrain in order to condole with the A1 Khalifah on the death of Shaikh Hamad and to congratulate the new Ruler, (vi) Two Saudi Arabian officials, the Directors of Customs of A1-Khobar and Oatif, arrived^on May 10th. The object of their visit was to purchase electric fittings for Ibn Baud’s palace at Riyadh, (vii) Colonel Hall, with three other officers of the Iraq Levies, arrived on 14th May. 70. Royal A ir Force . (i) Reference para 47 of Intelligence Summary No.6 of 1942 in which it was reported that Flying Officer R.A.A. Bratt had assumed charge of the duties of Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain. The extent to which R.A.F. activities have recent ly developed in Bahrain has made it necessary to appoint a more senior officer to the posn of Air Liaison Officer. On the 15th May Squadron Leader W.A. Chase arrived at Bah rain and has taken over charge as Air Liaison Officer Persian Gulf and Officer Commanding R.A.F. detachment, Bahrain. His duties will be many and varied,.but he al ready knows Bahrain well and his appointment is welcome both by the Agency and by the Bahrain Government. (ii) Reference para 60 (v) of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942 in which it was reported that a levy service was being recruited locally for the protection o~ the Bahrain aerodrome. Encouraging progress has been made in the execution of this scheme. Within a week of the date when sanction to the scheme was received over 1000 candidates for recrui ment had been medically examined and either accepted or-3- tv* &amp; V'' v “tUs- ^.o. QjyjyLk rejected. By May 10th the 240 men selected were comfortably housed in an old Palace lent for the purpose by His Highness the Shaikh, were receiving rations from the Police Department, and were being vigorously drilled -nfo some kind of shape by N.C.O.s of the State Police. The new force is a mixed one, comprising as it does blacks, village Baharina, local Arabs, a few Persians and a number of mainland Arabs. The majority of the men are divers by profession, and some difficulty was caused by the fact that many of them had received their diving advances for this season from the Nakhudas by whom they were to be employed. However, the Bahrain Government came to the rescue by repaying all such advances to the Nakhudas concerned. The local Government will recoup itself by making small monthly deductions from the pay of the recruits. Accommodation for the new force is to be construct ed by the Bahrain Government, acting on behalf of the R.A.F., on sites near the aerodrome which are now being selected. By May 3.0th all the initial steps in the raising of the two new companies of Levies had been taken, and the Bahrain Government could do little more to develop their organization. On May 14th Colonel Hall of the Iraq Levies arrived in Bahrain accompanied by the officers and N.C.O.s who will train the new force. The HhC.O.,s are from the ( Iraq Levies. The Commanding Officer of the now force is ■Major J.L.Kinnaird, Royal Irish Fusiliers. He has two other British Officers under him, Captain G.E.C. Hudson of the Royal West Kent Regiment and Lieutenant A.F.S. Curtin of the Royal Ulster Rifles. These officers have all been seconded from their Regiments for special duty with the Levies. Colonel Hall, who has already seen the recruits at their drill, has expressed his satisfaction at their keenness and enthusiasm. Further training of the force will not be easy, but Major Hewitt, Defence Officer, will help with trained men from his Special lonice, and the Bahrain Government will continue to give such he j p as may be required from their own police. [ That so much has already been accomplished in so short a time is due mainly to the enthusiastic cooperation of Mr. Belgrave. The fact that a. good start has been made in ,Bahrain is likely to help in the creation of similar forces in Dubai and Sharjah. (iii) The Manager, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, recently suggested to H.M-fs Minister, Jeddah, that, if r^n.-f Saud would permit such a step to be taken, his Company were prepared to mark out emergency landing grounds along the coast between Kuwait and Dhahran, where so many forced landings have recently occurred. Ibn Baud gave the per mission asked for, and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company then asked the Political Agent to arrange for a Royal Air Force officer with full knowledge of service require ments to visit Bahrain as soon as possible in order to advise the Company as to the nature of Royal Air Force needs. Bouadron Leader Chase has now' arrived at Bahrain and is matking contact with Mr.Bteineke, the Oil Company’s Chief Geologist, who claims to know every inch of the coastline from Dhahran to the Kuwait boundary. 71. A ssi sta nce to A ircraft. Reference para 62 (ii) of rCntelligence Summary No.8 of 1942 in which it was reported that^ three Hurricanes had been forced to land near Has al Misha ab (Saudi Arabia) on April 19th. / The-4- The California Arabian Standard Oil Company were most anxious to give any assistance that might be required of them in salvaging the aircraft, and their offer was communicated to the Political Agent, Kuwait. The offer was not at first accepted as a Royal Air Force salvage party were already at work. However, it was found necessary in the end to take advantage of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's offer and the Company sent a salvage party which lost no time in dealing with the situation with complete success. A detailed report of the salvage operations has not yet been received. 72. Defence . (i) Reference clauses (i) and (ii) of para 61 of Intelligence Summary No.8 of 1942. The programmes for the protection against air attack of the Refinery and Tanks at Awali and for the plugging of wells surplus to production requirements have been accorded formal approval, which was conveyed to the Bahrain Petroleum Company through the Political Agent. (ii) In Manama and Muharraq good progress is being made in the construction of slit trenches and in the promotion of other A.R.P. measures. 73. Enemy Action . Something of a sensation was caused locally by the arrival, on May 5th, of thirteen sailors from Qatar whose dhow had been sunk by a (presumably) Japanese submarine. The statement of these sailors, who were repatriated to Qatar at the expense of the Agency, is of such interest that it is attached as an Appendix to this Summary. In Bahrain the sailors were hospitably treated by everyone, and were given an interview by His Highness the Shaikh. The incident has provoked much execration of the Japanese, whose action in sinking a small Arab trading ship is regarded as one of wanton brutality, 74. S audi Arabia . Owing to a local shortage of dates in and near Qatif the export of that fruit has been forbidden until next season's crop is marketed. Meat and ghi can only be exported from Qatif under permits, which are not granted unless the local supply exceeds local requirements. 75. Economic. jfa (i) Supplies of foodstuffs in Bahrain, other than wheat and wheat flour, are satisfactory. There is, however, no wheat in the bazaar and, by the end of the period under review, stocks of flour had been exhausted. Bakers f shops began closing on May 11th, and by May 15th bread was unobtainable. It is hoped that it will be possible to obtain further stocks of flour from India in the near future. In the meantime, however, this further reminder to the public that the War is a reality which affects them personally aid individually is not unwelcome and may prove salutary. (ii) In view of the necessity of conserving local supplies, exports to Persia can only be permitted on a restrict ed scale. At present Persian Nakhudas who bring to Bahrain their usual cargoes of fuel, livestock, vegetable ghee etc. are permitted to export in return piece goods up to one third of the value of their imports and foodstuffs up to one sixth of the value of their imports. These ratios are now being reconsidered, and it is probable that export of piecegoods will shortly be allowed up to two thirds of the value of imports. / 76.• -5- 76. Local Affairs. (i) News that three of Rashid All's colleagues in treason had been executed caused a stir in Bahrain. It was taken for granted that British influence was responsible both for the promulgation of the death sentence and for the carrying out of that sentence 5 and local Arabs were surprised that action so drastic should have been taken by the British. After dis cussion of the matter from every angle for several days, at every street corner and in every coffee-shop in Bahrain, the feeling that remained dominant was still one of surprise that the British could have done something so different from what popular estimate of their character expected of them. (ii) The Qadis have protested to His Highness the Shaikh against the increase of i: morality in Bahrain, which they attribute largely to the presence here of so many foreigners from the West. They mentioned particularly the blatant behaviour of the prostitutes who parade along the Manama- Awali road, and the growth of liquour drinking among the Moslem community. Steps are being taken by the Bahrain » Government which will, it is hoped, result in confining immoral practices to certain specified quarters which the Qadis will not, or certainly should not, visit. 77. S muggling of gold . On May 11 th a Basrah goldsmith named Ibrahim Isaac Shebbath, who had been on a visit to Bahrain where his partner Said Na’aman lives, returned to Basrah by air. On arrival at Basrah he was searched and was found to be carrying a number of gold coins and a gold belt. He Was arrested by the Iraq police. Shebbath is an Iraqi Jew. The question of deporting his Bahrain partner is under consideration. Inquiries are also being made into the circumstances in which Shebbath was able successfully to take the gold on to the Flying Boat by which he travelled from Bahrain to Basrah. 78. The Oil Companies . (i) Reference para 64 (i) of Intelligence Summary No .8 of 1942. Mr. Ohliger, formerly Resident Manager, California Arabian Standard Oil Company, left for the United States on May 15th. (ii) Industrial conscription for employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and of Petroleum Concessions Limited who are British subjects or British Protected Persons was announced on May 8 th and made effective from May 9th. European and Canadian British subjects appear to have accepted the measure quietly and regard it as one which is both fair and necessary. Indians are not so happy about it, and discontent in some quarters is growing. 79. Meteorological . Maximum temperature 105°on 10th and 11th May. Minimum temperature 71°on 2nd and 3rd May. Humidity exceeded 70% on 2 days the maximum being 89% on the 8 th May. May 10 th and 11th were close, hot, airless days and nights which made the relaxation of sleep almost unattainable. On May 12th a strong North wind got up which cleared the at mosphere, brought relief to man and beast, and was still blow ing at the end of the fortnight under report. Sd. E.B. Wakefield. Political Agent, Bahrain.APPENDIX. Statement male by 13 sailors of Boom ,, Samhan M belonging to Abdullah Mahmud of Qatar. Recorded on 5th May 1942. The Boom ,, Samhan ,, left Qatar after the Id of Ramazan (October r 41) for Basrah where we shipped dates and sailed for Karachi. We stayed one day in Karachi whence we went to Khor Miyan where we landed 200 baskets of dates and then we went to Brawa where we sold all the dates to a Hindu mere’ chant of Brawa who asked us to take the dates to Bombay and deliver them to his agent. We went to Bombay where we stayed one month after delivery of the dates to the agent of the Hindu merchant. We then left Bombay for Calicut where we shipped wood for Basrah and other articles, such as ropes, pulleys and wood, for Qatar. After staying 25 days at Calicut we left it and arrived at Goa after 9 days. We stayed 2 days at Goa where we took fresh water. About the 18th Rabi I (5th April 1942) we left Goa with the in tention of going to Muscat but after 7 days journey a subma rine appeared at sea and fired on our dhow. There was a Kuwaiti Boom belonging to Muhamad hin Jarullah with us. The Kuwaiti Boom was also fired on by the submarine. Both the Booms sunk. We managed to get ourselves into our jolly-boat and picked up the sailors of the Kuwaiti Boom as their jolly-boat was broken into pieces. No one lost his life but two sailors of the Qatari Boom were seriously and one slightly injured. We were able to reach Malwan port after remaining 5 days at sea in our jolly-boat. We left the two sick men, and two other sailors to look after t’hem, at Malwan where we stayed 3 days. The Government officials sent us by car from Malwan to Ratnagiri where we stayed one night, and then we were put on board one of the coastal ships which took us to Bombay. After 5 days stay in Bombay we were put on board the Barpeta which arrived at Bahrain today. The Nakhuda of our Boom stayed in Bombay. The Nakhuda and sailors of the Kuwaiti Boom, with the exception of two of them who landed at Muscat, are on board the Barpeta on their way to Kuwait. We beg the High Government to help us and repatriate us to Qatar. We have lost all our belongings and we have not a single penny for our ex penses .

By courtesy of Squadron Leader Newell, Officer Commanding, B.A.F., Sharjah, he was enabled to make the journey in a Blenheim, which unfortunately crashed on landing. The passengers were almost unhurt but the machine sustained both a broken back and a broken nose. The accident was due to^ a soft spot on the aerodrome. The Garrison Engineer in charge of the aerodrome was also a passenger in the aircraft.

Material not available locally is being shipped from Basra, and the Bahrain Petrol eum ^ Company are already starting work in anticipation of Political approval of the programme. (ii) Thu plugging with cement of a number of oil wells _y l ^ so started in accordance with a programme approved by Middle East Command. The Company await receipt of formal approval through the Political authorities. 1 (iii)In Manama and Muharraq intense excitement was caused by the publication on April 16th in the local news paper of the following notices- ”In the present war situ ation the Islands of Bahrain have come within the zone of operations. The Government are taking steps to protect the inhabitants and are also adopting all necessary measures in connection with air raids ..... Al Bahrain (the name of the local newspaper) advises the town dwellers of Bahrain who are able to do so to disperse to villages and places on the seashore and especially to send away their women and children before the summer. ,r Force was given to the warning contained in the news paper by a simultaneous outburst of A.R.P. activity sponsored by a strong Committee whose members have been carefully chosen for their personality, energy and intelligence. The most obvious evidence of the new Committee’s activities is the re moval of the highly inflammable ’'chitai’ matting with which the narrow streets of the bazaars are roofed. During the last few days there has been a big exodus of the well-to-do from Manama and Muharraq to summer residences (mostly barasti huts) south of Budaiya, All who can afford it are also sending away their women and children to settle ments of hastily erected huts along the sea shore. Public / spirit-3- soirit in regard to A,R*P. measures is lacking, but appeals to self-interest are evoking some response from merchants and shop-keepers» ♦ For the first time the people of Bahrain are now thinking of the war as something which affects themselves and their own personal security 0 Merchants, and particul arly Persian merchants, are in a state of alarm,, The most undesirable element of the population - the roughs and toughs and riff-raff- are indulging in loose talk about the looting they will engage in during the darkness and confusion which follow air raids by night. A list of such persons is being compiled and they will, if necessary, be put under restraint. On the whole I consider that the stir, which was deliberately provoked by the insertion of the notice in the local newspaper, has served a'useful purpose. It has stim ulated interest in A.R.P. and has prepared the minds of the populace for possibly future eventualities. 62. As sistance to Airc raft . (i) On April 19th a Hurricane had to land at Has Tanura (Saudi Arabia) from lack of petrol. Thanks to prompt inform ation given by the Resident Manager of the California Arabian. Standard Oil Company, petrol and assistance were immediately despatched from Bahrain, and the aircraft was able subsequent- to renew its flight. (ii) On the same day, Aoril 19th, information was also received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, that three Hurri canes had been forced to land near Ras si Misha’ab (Saudi Arabia), and assistance from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company was asked for. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company immediately sent out a search party which succeed ed in locating the aircraft, but only after assistance had al ready arrived from Kuwait. 63. B a hr ain a n d Qatar . Reference par a 46 of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No,6 of 1942, in which it was reported that restrictions on the entry of Cater subjects into Bahrain were being more rigid ly enforced by H.H. Shaikh Salman. There is reason to believe that Shaikh Salman hopes to provoke the Shaikh.of Qatar into protests, which would lead to negotiations, which would, in turn, lead to reconsideration of the position of the A1 Khali fa in Zubare. The present hostility between Qatar and Bahrain has several unfortunate consequences, and an improvement in the relations between the two Sheikhdoms would be generally welcomed. 64„ The Bahrain Petr ol ean C o mpany L im ited and the C alifornia Arabian Standard Oil Company.

Prom the source they received in formation that the ruling had been made at the request of 'American authorities”« The first reaction seems to have been one of indignant amazement that an American citizen’s liberty of movement could be restricted in any way, and the Company’s Man ^gors have sent cables to their Principals asking for enlightenment. They are particularly anxious to know ’’American authorities' could have prompted or connived at the step which has been taken, (iii) At a dance and variety entertainment held at Awrli on the night of Amril 16th nearly b 10,000 urns raised for War Charities. 65.

(iii) Reference paragraph 37 (iii) of Intelligence Summary No.5 of 1942 in which I reported certain local popular reactions / ' to the building of the R.A.F. camp at Muharraq. It is of interest in this connexion to recall what happened in the last War when it was desired to land troops in Bahrain. On the 23rd October 1914 a portion of the Indian Ex peditionary Force arrived in transports off Bahrain. The atti tude of the Ruler, Shaikh Isa, was friendly, and preparations were made for the landing of the troops. But popular agitation was so great, and there was such intense public opposition to the proposal that the troops should come ashore, that they were compelled to remain on board for the whole of their stay of nine days. The public of Bahrain were convinced - and their convictic could not be shaken - that if once British or Indian troops land ed on their island they would remain there in permanent occupation The people of Bahrain are still frightened at the thought of any considerable number of military forces being stationed in the island, but their present apprehensions have a very different cause. They no longer fear permanent military occupation by the British, nor would they think that Bahrain’s independence was being menaced. Their fear is of the conseq uences which they associate with the presence of troops on the Island. Soldiers in Bahrain means war in Bahrain, and war i In Bahrain means bombing in Bahrain. That is, at present, their j chain of thought, and they think, illpgically, that if there J were no soldiers in Bahrain there would be no bombing here. This is the general feeling of the common people. Individuals, of course, have their personal reactions, appropriate to their social status and their standards of intelligence. Small merchants look forward to the presence of military person nel with feelings of pleasure, horn of the expectation of doing profitable trade with them. Poor people dread a rise of prices consequent on an increased demand for milk, meat, eggs, vegetab les etc. The more conservative elements of the population are frightened of insults to, or interference with, their womenfolk. Others, living near the Muharraq aerodrome and camp, are fright ened of becoming targets for enemy air attack. There are, at present, few outside the Ruling Family (who could ill-afford to lose their share of the profits which accrue from the working of the Bahrain Oil Field) who realise / how&gt; -3 how essential to the safety of the island is a we11-organized defence* 45. Dhow Traffic * v-v . Reference paragraph 36 (i) of Intelligence Summary - No.5 of 1942. It Is reported that a launch sent from Kuwait to search for the missing boom succeeded in locating the wreckage and in salvaging from it rupees and riyals to the value of about Rs 1,15,000* 46. Bahrain and Qatar . Since 1937 subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar have not been allowed to visit Bahrain without obtaining, through the Agency, the prior permission of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. Enforcement of this prohibition was not very strict during the latter months of Shaikh Hamad’s life, but Shaikh Salman is now insisting on its rigid application. Shaikh Salman is as firmly convinced as was his father of the justice of the Bahrain claim to sovereignty over Zubara, and it seems likely that hostility to the Shaikh of Qatar is likely to increase rather than diminish during Shaikh Salman’s rule. 47.

Major H.T. Hewitt, M.C., Defence Office, Bahrain, has been ordered to India for medical treatment as his broken leg has not set satisfactorily. (ii) Reference paragraph 9 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.2 of 1942, in which I reported the dissatisfaction of all community % I ies in Bahrain at the Island 1 s unpreparedness to resist hostile / S attack. During the last month certain building operations have been in progress and it is now apparent to all that active steps are being taken for the defence of Bahrain. Adverse comments on this topic are now comparatively rare among the European communitj and from the more responsible elements of the Arab or Indian communities. (iii)In Muharraq, where the building of a camp for Royal Air Force personnel is proceeding apace, there is a certain amount of hostile criticism. The common people fear that the local pur- 1 chase of supplies by Royal Air Force personnel will put up bazaar prices. Bazaar supplies of meat and eggs (which are for the most part imported from Iran) are limited in quantity, and it may be difficult to increase supolies to meet an increased demand. A further cause of apprehension is that the existence of a mili tary camp in the vicinity of Mhharr^q will attract hostile air attack. A few people living in the village immediately adjoin ing the new Royal Air Force camp have already made preparations to move to another locality. 38. Local Affairs . His Highness Shaikh Salman was, prior to his accession, President of the Court of Wards Committee. He has been succeed ed in this post by his brother Shaikh Dua* ij bin Hamad.

K.C.I.E.. C.S.I. (i) The anniversary of the accession of Shaikh Hamad was celebrated on the 16th February. A ceremonial parade of the State forces was held in front of the palace. Shaikh Hamad attended the parade but, as he was having trouble with a rheumatic leg, remained seated throughout. I also attended the parade and noticed that Shaikh Hamad looked tired and drawn. After the parade the Shaikh went to stay at his country house at Rumaitha. (ii) At about 8.30 p.m. on the 17th February Shaikh Hamad has a stroke while saying his prayers. He fefel on his side, unconscious, and never subsequently recovered consciousness. Dr. Snow estate Medical Officer), Dr. Holmes ^Residency Sur geon) and Dr. Harrison (American Mission) attended Shaikh Hamad and one of them was always with him until he died at about 12.15 p.m. on Friday, February 20th. At the time of his death only Dr. Holmes and one or two servants were present. Members of the family had left the house to take their midday meal. Shaikh Hamad was buried in the cemetery at Rafa* on the afternoon of the 20th February. Ho public notice oi the funeral was given and several close relatives were unable to be present. Shaikh Hamad 1 s death at the age of about 70 occasioned general and sincere grief. Hot only hao he^ proved a true friend of the British Government but he had always given a friendly and syriqpathetic hearing to all who came to him with their troubles. Messages of condolence were received from all quarters of the globe. 24. His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah. It was generally supposed that 'when Shaikh Hamad died the succession would be disputed. Many people expected that Shaikh Abdullah bin f Isa, the younger of Shaikh Hamad 1 s two surviving brothers, would seize the power; many expected that Shaikh : alman bin Hamad, the late Ruler’s eldest son, would command the greatest support; some regarded one or other of Shaikh Salman’s younger brothers as potentially successful claimants; while among the Baharina there were not a few who expected the British Government, on the death of Shaikh Hamad, to assume direct control of the Bahrain Administration. Few expected the peaceful transition from one rule to another which has in fact taken place. On the Evening prior to Shaikh Hamad’s death, Shaikh Abdullah paid a private visit to Shaikh Salman and promised to support him if, in the event of Shaikh Hamad dying, he would agree to succeed his father. After discussion Shaikh Salman agreed /-- 3 - agreed to take his fattier* s place as Ruler of Bahrain if all the family wo ild support him. Shaikh Mohammad hin *Isa must have been told of the arrangement for, immediately after Shaikh Hamad* s death, when members of the family assembled at Rumaitha, he announced that Shaikh Salman would succeed Shaikh Haifiad and asked whether anyone had any objection. The members of the family present, seeing that Shaikh Salman had the support of his two uncles, gave their unanimous consent to his succession, Meanwhile there was lying in the vaults oi the Bahrain branch of the Eastern Bank a deed signed by Shaikh Hamad appointing Shaikh Sf Iraan as his successor. The contents of ttiis deed, were unknown to any member of the A1 Khalifah; nor did the A1 Khalifah know that Shaikh Hamad had in fact appointed a successor. This deed/was taken to Shaikh Salman on the eve/ning of February 20th. Knowledge of its contents soon became general and helped greatly to consolidate Shaikh Salman*s new position. On February 21st I paid condolence visits to Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, Shaikh Mohamnad bin ’Isa, Shaikh Abdullah bin * Isa and Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad (father-in-law of Sha ikh HameLd) • On the morning of February 22nd Shaikh Salman visited me accompanied by his two uncles and Mr, Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government. shaikh Salman informed me that his succession to his father had the unanimous approval of his family and subjects; and he assured me in unequivocal terms of his friendship for the British Government and of his deter mination to respect existing treaties and engagements. In the afternoon of February 22nd Shaikh Salman issued a proclamation announcing that, in conformity with the behest of his late father and with the unanimous consent of his uncles, his brothers and all his tribe, he had become the Ruler of Bahrain. The proclamation contained the following J words *- H I shall continue to strengthen the proved ties with | the British Entire and shall always maintain its friendship”. The succession of Shaikh Salman has been accepted by all sections of the Bahrain community. Shaikhs hoharanad and Abdullah intend to be the rt powers behind the throne”. Shaikh Salman is not popular with his younger brothers but none of them is in a position to dispute his authority. Other members of the Khalifah family accept Shaikh Salman as being the right and proper successor to Shaikh Hai.iad, The Baharina are relieved that Shaikh Salman, rather than Shaikh Mohammad or Shaikh Abdullah, has become the Ruler; and only the young oloods of the town (who are anti-British in sentiment) are disgruntled about Shaikh Salman’s succession. As Shaikh Salman has asked . r. Belgrave to remain as Adviser to the Bahrain Government, violent upheavals in the administration are unlikely. It is possible, however, that friction will be caused inside the Khalifah lamily when the thorny problem of dividing Shaikh Hamad’s large estate is taken up. Shaikh Salman’s succession has been formally recognised by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 25. Economic (i) Reference paragraph 17 (iii) of Intelligence Suitmary Bo. 3 of 1942.-/ i - 4 - Steps have been taken to reduce to tho absolute miniinum the export of gold from Bahrain to non-Empire countries# Exports of silver will also be restricted in future to the requirements of bona fide trade transactions. (ii) Shops in the flourishing bazaar of Dubai (Trucial Coast) still hold considerable stocks of Japanese piece- goods# As they are disposed of they are being replaced by piecegoods of Indian manufacture. in one shop a number of Italian blankets were seen. They were said to have been imported about three years ago. 26. Broadcasting . (i) The appreciative references on the -London radio to Shaikh Hamad caused favourable comment among all classes in Bahrain, and particularly among the Khalifah family. (ii) The death of Shaikh Hamad was announced on the radio from Rome. The broadcaster added i 'It will be remembered that Bahrain is the place whose oil refinery was destroyed by Italian aircraft 18 months ago'. This coiiment has been the cause of much amusement locally. (iii) In Bahrain and along the Trucial Coast the broad casts from Berlin in Arabic by Yunis Bahri are regarded with positive distaste. The language which he uses, leoxnt in the gutters of Iraq, offends the ears of Arabs on the Persian Gulf. Moreover, details of his disreputable past are so well-known that his opinions are discredited even ^ before he utters them. 27* Saudi Arabia (i) Ahmad bin Khalaf, a leading merchant of Abu Dhabi who is also related to the Shaikh of that ploce, visited Riyadh on his return from the Haj. He was greatly im pressed by Ibn Baud’s unequivocal support of the British cause. ibn Baud’s sympathy for the British was expressed both in public and in private. (ii)Abdul Aziz Qosaibi, a leading merchant of Bahrain, has recently returned from Riyadh. He brought with him the story of another attempted assassination of Ibn Saud. His story is that in the middle of February three femanis came to Riyadh, each with several hundred gold sovereigns. With tnis money they bribed one of ibn Baud’s slaves to introduce them as religious mendicants on one of the occasions when Ibn Saud would himself distribute alms. The conspirators’ plans were, however, overheard by the slave’s mother-in-law, who reported the matter to Ibn Saud. Two of the three Yemanis and the slave were arrested and a bomb was found in their possession. The slave was executed and the two Yemanis were sent under a strong guard to the Hedjaz where further enquiries were to be made. 28. .Local Opinion ( i) Arabs on the Trucial Coast find it difficult to understand the successes of the Japanese, whom they regard as a despicable race. indeed, they consider Japan’s entry into a war between major powers such as Britain and Germany to be impudent - as though pygmies were to intervene in a gigantomachy.

There was nothing except the news which consisted of a muxture of garbled reports and some ridiculous propaganda such as 'Great Britain and the United States of America are shaking in fear of a Japanese attack on Singapore' and 'Japan fights in China to save it from foreign domination and works for eastern unity on the principle - the east is.for the easterners - and this will include Arabic unity and freedom'.

(i) On the 5th March, the Political Agent attended tne Senior Joint Court in company with His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. Three cases were dealt with. h'*- ^ petition containing some 60 signatures of promi— nent merchants in Bahrain has been received complaining excessive delay in censorbhip in India of air mail covers addressed to Bahrain. The average delay from the samples submitted amounted to 15^ days. The matter has been taken up. viii) On.the.7th March 1941, cricket and fooLball 1 ? aid of l ar Charities, were played in Manama, mong the large number of spectators present were Commo dore and Mrs. Graham, Major and Mrs. Alban, Mr and Mrs. d e r graver0 an d Mrs. Kennedy and Mr. and Mrs. deGrenier Gate receipts amounted to about Rs.llOO/- kiv) It is reported that there is dissatisfaction in Manama at the number of middlemen allowed to carry on business in the fish market. The fish market belongs ^nrw haikh Dai ^ bin Hamad &gt; and ha lets it cut for Rs. C/'T P er annum to a contractor who encourages numerous middle-men (known as Muta r ayyishah') because they each pay him a toll. This system used to obtain in Muhar-raq, been ab0lish ed by the Municipal Council there, * with the result that fish can be bought there for cne- third the price it costs in Manama. Some time ago, the Council proposed that the sys- i h ?, aale of&gt; ^^ s h should be revised; whereunon Shaikh ba i j and Abdullah bin Jabur went and complained to His Highness, representing that Shaikh Dai’j’s mono poly ot the fish market was imperilled. His Highness ,hen wrote a letter to the Council, instructing them to drop the matter. a v Y).

(vi)Yusuf Yasin (Secretary to Ibn Saud) has sent t. E .5 to the Editor of the 'A1 Bahrain'. (Note :- A year s^subscription to this paper is Rs.4/- so the remit tance is clearly to keep the Editor 'sweet' from Ibn baud's pnint of vie©). (vii) It is reported that Yusuf Fakhroo, a prominent Bahrain merchant, opposed the wish of 20 Iranians living in Muharraq to adopt Bahrain nationality. (Note:- From -his may be inferred, in conjunction with previous reports ol Iranians' expectations of a 'visit' from the Shah in he near future, that Yusuf Fakhroo has pan-Iranian aspi- ra.Lions • (viii) The Chief Shia' Qadhi, Abdul Hussein el Hilli, has been indulging in discussions of the policy of the 'Iraq Government, with an anti-British bias.(iv) /- 99(ix) The sale of tickets for the school play 'Italian Atrocities in Libya' in aid .of the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund has called forth the comment 'what about a Dlay on British atrocities in Palestine ?'. (x) The last mail to India, S.S. 'Barala', was full of Polish and Roumanian refugees. (xi) It is understood that the Bahrain Petroleum Company has 'laid off' about 40 drivers. (xii) A story is going round, based on a letter said to have been received by Yusuf Fakhroo, that a large dhow (nakhuda Abdullah bin Mohammad el Kingi) which recently cleared from Aden with a cargo of salt, was stopped by a British warship. The dhow hoisted Iranian colours, but was fired on and sunk with the loss of all her crew except five. (xiii) It is learned that Ahmad el Jabur, Secretary of Nadi el Mukhtalat el Riyadh! (i.e. Mixed Sports Club) sometimes lectures in the said Nadi styling himself as 'Hitler'. 40. Local Opinion (i) The Balkan situation has caused various comments. One theory is that Turkey's attitude is one of bhckmail on Britain to get all she can for herself and is compared with Russia's attitude to Germany. It has also, rather surprisingly, been heard stated as an oninion that Turkey is true to her pledges and when the time comes will be joined by 'Iraq. Some people have said that Russia is waiting to help.carve up Turkey as she did Poland. As far as the opinion of 'the common plebs' can be gauged, they welcome the news as bringing nearer the day when, they hope, Germans will turn out the British from the Middle East. The few maturer minds among them do, however, read aright the lessons of Poland, Holland, etc •, and see the force, to themselves, of Hitler's racial categorization /t-He world. Some comment is now being noticed in local majlises as to the fate of 'Iraq, Syria and other Muslim communities. (ii) An old date merchant, by the name of El’Amiri, when heard to curse the German radio, was asked the reason for his preference for the British. His reply was that he noticed older and God-fearing men who visited the mosques regularly were in favour of Britain winning the war.. When reminded of Palestine, he said, 'Everyone is forgiven three mistakes; this is only their first'. (iii) Speculation is rife regarding Turkey's attitude, the most common theory being that she will betray Britain in the end. Theposition of Persian and Iraq under the Sa’adabad Pact, in the event of Turkey being attacked, was raised at a local majlis. It was thought that their hos- tility to Britain would stop them from helning Turkey. The ragged and ill-fed condition of the Persian Army was commented on. The Soviet radio's recent expressions of disapproval of Bulgaria's surrender have been considered by some sec tions to be a mere grick to allay suspScions of an actual league with Germany to divide up Turkey like Poland and Roumania.- 4 - (iv) Local rumour goes that the 'Vita” and 'Barpeta ,f have been sumk in the Hed Sea, Some even go so far as to say that all the ships that are not on service have -v been sumk. This is not ? however 9 generally believed® and another version is that the ships taken off service are taking war materials to India and Egypt, 41. Bahrain Petroleum Company . From a telegram seen in censorship, it appears that, owing to exchange difficulties, the Bahrain Petrol- eurn Company may intend laying out a proportion of their profits in the.Island, eg. buying tug boats at present on mre, or building quarters for employees other than staff employees. 42. Co mmercial (i) Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam, a prominent Neidi mer chant, has sent £ 300/- in gold to be sold in Baghdad, 'k e ^ e ‘£ ram k as been sent from Tehran to Mohammad Abdul NabiBushiri asking him to send 3 tons of pearl + v, el A S -i (Note:- German commercial agents in ohe kj\i±± before the war, e.g. Herr Wattenburg, were inter ested ip mother of pearl buttons). 43. Saudi Arabia (i) It is learned that Amir Saud, accompanied by Amir iaisal is paying a visit to Al Khobar shortly; and that a general shuffle of Saudi officials is expected, (ii) It is said that the Saudi Government intends to open a school at Al Khobar. (iii) It is reported that Ibn Saud has imposed a purchase tax on a number of cars which have been sold by Casoc, his object presumably being to force Casoc to sell to him at a lov; price. m u iv) P * 8 rumo ^eb that the Saudi Finance Minister and ohammad Sarur el Sabban, Head of the Finance Department, will^shortly arrive at Al Khobar to discuss with the C£li- lornia Arabian btandard Oil Company the restriction of the Company's operations. ov, ^72 6 -*- e ^ er bas been seen in censorship from Otham to S ^ 1 } dl ^ Yusuf Yasin,. Private Secretary to Ibn Saud, in which he recounts his private history for the last few years; regrets that he was unable to visit Yusuf Yasin, and says that he had hoped to bring the 'Amirs' who are in China to Mecca. The letter appears to be a preparatory one to some proposal of advantage to the writer, 44. Kuwait (i) Reference paragraph No.31 (ix) of my Intelligence Summary No.4 of 1941. ,, , A nakhudar who has just arrived from Kuwait reported that Saif bin Thani was well received by the Shaikh of Kuwait, as he had, very judiciously, been generous to 18 shipwrecked Kuwaitis, who were travelling on the same ship, ihe Dhaikh of Kuwait gave him Rs.600/- and obtained tele-~ graphic permission for Saif to bisit Riyadh.

INDIA OFFICE Adviser /-2 Adviser to the Bahrain Government along with other im portant personages, called at the Agency to pay him thv r respects. Dr. and Mrs Dame, prior to their departure to the United States of America, on leave, called at the Agency on the 17th February 1941. Bahrain notables paid a call on the Political Resident on the morning of the IBtJi. Thefollowing day, Shaikh Mohammad bin ’Isa, who had not accompanied the Shaikh of Bahrain on his visit to the Political Resident, paid a separate call on the Political Resi dent . On the evening of the 17th February, His Kighnec: the Shaikh of^Bahrain gave a banquet in honour of the Political Resident. Among others, the following were present: Commodore and Mrs. Graham, Major and Mrs. Al ban, Mr and Mrs Belgrave, Captain and Mrs Howes, Mr and Mrs deGrenier. Before the guests took their deoarture- His Highness presented the Political Resident with a oho- tograph of himself along with a cheque of Rs. 30,000/- for the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. (ii) About the middle of the month, the orece of sovereigns rose from Rs.32/- to Rs.36/- to~Rs.36/4/-. rhe reason for this is probably due to the fact that mer chants dealing with Japanese firms received a telegram on the 16th February raising all prices by 25%. This, coupled with the uncertainty in the far east has caused some uncertainty. ^/ices oi some Japanese goods have only risen abott 5 and it i s stated by a prominent piece goods merchant that the stocks of Japanese piece goods in Bahrain will last for three years. Trade in Japanese goods received a set back as a result of a rumour spread in the bazaar on the afternoon of the 16th February that war had broken out between Japan and Great Britain. .(iv) A petition containing some 60 signatures of pro minent merchants in Bahrain has been received oomplain- mg of extraordinary delay in censorship in India'of air mail covers addressed to Bahrain, the average delay from the samples submitted, amounts to 15 % days.

Movements of British Officials . (i) On the 3rd February, I visited Shaikh Hamad at Sakhir, prior to going over to Qatar to visit the P.C.L. Camp at Riyan and pay a call on the Shaikh. Shaikh Hamad requested me to convey his regards to Shaikh Abdul lah bin Qasim, and to congratulate him on his safe return from the Haj. (ii) On the 6 th February 1941, I visited the Zekrit Headquarters of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar. I was entertained by Mr. Ensor, the Senior representative on the spot. Afterwards I proceeded to Riyan where I was entertained by Shaikh Abdullah bin Zasim. Shaikh Abdullah had with him Shaikh Hamad his son, and Saleh el Mana, his secretary and Adviser. Abdullah bin Darweesh was also seen at Zekrit. Shaikh Abdullah seemed to be in exceptionally good health* He had just come in from his desert camp. The opportunity was taken of conveying to him the greet ings of Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa, Ruler of Bahrain, which he returned with every show of cordiality, although at the same time expressing regret at the present state of strained relations between the two Shaikhdoms, which was attributed to the fault of 'others'. The opportunity was taken of speaking to the Shaikh on the taxes levied by his son on Qatari employees of Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Shaikh apparently knew nothing of this. When he had gone out of the room, it was explained to me by the Indian doctor pf Petroleum Concessions Limited that taxes were levied by Shaikh Hamad, the son, without the knowledge of his father. I thereupon adked Shaikh Hamad whether such taxes had been levied and he replied, somewhat defiantly, that they were much less than those of other countries. I told him that in Bahrain no such REC*.

(i) On the 3rd February 1941, Dr. and Mrs, Storm of the American Mission had a dinner, at which all the sons of His Highness Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa, except Shaikh Su- iaiman, were present. Shaikh Khalifa bin Mohamad bin 'Isa and his uwo brothers and Hussain Yateem were there also. Other.guests invited were Commodore and Mrs. Graham, the Political Agent and Mrs Alban and Dr. Barney of the Ameri can Mission. Shaikh Ali of Rufa was there also. Thj party was a success and some useful contacts were made. Most of the young men speak English and take a keen interest in local affairs. (ii) A visit was received on the 3rd Febriiary from Abdullah bin Jabr, Secretary to His Highness, who had just returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca. He said that everywhere he had heard hopes of an early Italian defeat and thankfulness for British victories. ^ Conditions in Hasa are much better owing to good rainfall this year. niii) During the period under review, His Highness Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa paid a visit to the Agency. It is signi- ficaiit perhaps that he came unaccompanied. I was able to present the compliments of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim of Qatar, which he had asked me to convey. His Highness spoke at greath length about the troubles which occurred in Qatar some years ago. He said that all the trouble in Qatar was the doing of Shaikh Hamad, second son of Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim and of his evil genius, Abdullah bin Darweesh. , Highness also complained about the expen- •diture he has to bear on account of allowances to members of the A 1 Khalifah family, guests, etc. /iv) Thu Political Agent and Mrs. Alban attended a dinner given oy Captain Howes to local Arab notables.

(vi) /-- 3 - I (vi)On the 14th February 1941, all the Sunni Per sians closed their shops as soon as they received the news of the death of Sultan-al-Dlama, the great est Sunni f Alim in South Iran. (vii) From a telegram seen in censorship, it appears that Petroleum Concessions Limited are having to enter into further negotiations with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah for an extension of their present permit, owing to their inability to carry out geo logical exploration within the limit of 2 J years. 24 • Bahrain Petroleuin Company Limited . The Political Agent and Mrs. Alban visited the Awali Camp at the invitation of Mr. Lipp, the General Manager, and were showh over the whole of the Camp and Refinery. New Concrete block quarters built for Bahrain*- i labourers and personnel were particularly note worthy. These quarters are meticulously clean and cool, roofed with corrugated asbestos and pro vided with electric light 4 rdnning water and cooking houses operated by gas, the cost of which works out at £ 40/- per head. The Commissariat, the Laundry, the linen store and spare parts department was visited. The Commissariat contains almost every known variety of food and drink, stored under the most hygenic conditions. Articles are sold to members of the Company at cost price only. The Laundry is up- to-date and the charge per head is only Rs.12/- per month. Employees are provided also with all household furnishing, matresses, etc., with the exception of sheets which they have to buy themselves. The cost of living for British employees at the Camp works out at a very low figure indeed. 25 * Accession of the Shaikh of Bahrain . The Political Agent, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent and Indian Assistant, pro ceeded to Manama Palace to pay their respects to and congratulate His Highness on the anniversary of his accession. Owing to complaints having been received that in the previous year no proper accommodation had been made for the British officials to be accommodated, the seating was arranged in the open at the foot of the Palace steps. The arrangements were very satis factory. The Senior Naval Officer, the Air Liaison Offi cer, the Defence Officer, the Assistant Defence Officer and others were also present. Soon /-Political Agent, Bahrain Soon after our arrival, the march past' of the Police and Special Police took place. The men were smartly turned out and the parade, as far as such things go, was a success. After the march past had been completed, the guests took their leave. (i) On the afternoon of the 12th February, there was an 'At Home 4 ' at the Agency in celebration of the access ion of Shaikh Hamad bin ’Isa al Khalifah. His High ness’ brothers and family were present also. The other guests included the Senior Naval Officer, and other important European Residents of Manama and Awali. Messrs.

Local Affairs. (i) On the 16th January at 6.30 p.mothe Political Agent attended a dinner given by Mr. Lipp, General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, in his house at Awali, to which His Highness Shaikh Hamad, his brothers and sons were also invited. This dinner seems to be an annual affair. Food was in the best American style and was much appreciated if not by His Highness at least by the others, * After dinner a colour film depicting the visit of Shaikh Mohammad bin ’Isa to the World’s Fair at New York was shown. Others present were Commodore Cosmo Graham, the Senior Naval Offi cer, and Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. (ii) On the 25th morning at 11 a.m. a meeting of the Anti malaria Committee was held in the Balagiyah. The Political Agent also attended the meeting. The work of the past year was reviewed and fresh measures for the continuation and expansion of programme were decided on. (iii) On the 22nd January a census was held throughout the Islands. There were several interesting rumours amongst the population regarding the object of the census, though there was no opposition to it. Some of the rumours current were : introduction of identity cards § introduction of conscription; expulsion of Iranians; compulsory medical3 examination etc. (iv) The Anglo-Iranian has telegraphed to K.'B.Nasib, their Muscat agent, as follows ’’Vessel Marzuk arrived Aden district carrying 500 tons can you trace exporters'*. They have also asked K.S. Hussain Amad, their Sharjah agent for the quantity sold to exporters and consignments shioped by themj ^ s 9 : ^ or '^^ ie quantity in Dubai not yet shipped. These may indicate contraband trade in oetrol or kerosene from Muscat and Sharjah, possibly to Italian East Africa. (v) Abdul Aziz Ali al Bassam ( a local Saudi merchant) has taken up the Agency of the Isbandosten Mollur Line. This line sails from New York, Philadelphia dnd Baltimore. The steamers are expected to carry cargo for Saudi Arabia. (vi) Vegetable ghee is now being imported into Bahrain from the Dutch East Indies. It used to come from Holland before the German occupation but now it is coming from the Dutch possessions in great Quantities. Abdullah Aujah and Muhammad Tayib Khunji have j'ust imported 1208 cases of this ghee, believed to be sufficient for 6 months. ( v ii) A Turk by name Osman Ay Cingiz Yusuf Ziya, arrived in Bahrain from Iraq on the 20th January by the S.S. Bankura. He had visas in his passport valid for Kuwait and Bahrain granted by Consul, Baghdad. He had no kit except one small handbag. The object of his visit is not known. From letters seen in censorship it would apnear that Osman was a destitute in Japan from where he went*to v eman. In Baghdad he was associated with Yemani students. One of his Yemani companions Sayid Hussain al Kibsi has telegraphed a complaint against him to the Heir Apparent of the Yeman from Muscat. It appears that Osman either lost or made away with three boxes belonging to Al Kisi on embarkation at Basra. He has telegraphed to the Heir Apparent of the Yeman stating that Al Kibsi himself lost these boxes intentionally and also asking for £ 50/- to be sent to him throught he Mutasarrif of Basra. It has been possible to collect the following dossier about Osman:- Son of a landowner near Ankara who supported Mustapha Kamal against the Greeks 5 apparently a 'soldier of fortune'; aged 36; speaks 7 languages; was a 'mir alai' in Yeman where he commanded 3000 men in suppressing civil disorders caused by billeting troops in private houses 0 then tried to get to Kashgar at the time of the coud there (win ter 1934 - 35)°, on failing in this went to China where he nominally taught Arabic to Chinese Muslims; actually aopears to have been an agent of Chiang Kai Shek with this section; later went over to the Japanese; in Tokio met Hussain Al Kibsi, the agent there of the Yemani Heir Apparent; tra velled with him to Basra on the S.S. Mantai Maru which did not apparently stop in India. With them were 30 boxes of silk, tea, etc., presumably for the Heir Apparent. It was three of these boxes which Osman lost (or made away v/ith). He has now returned to Basra. 17. Saudi Arabia . (i) The Saudi Government issued an order ea'•ly in the month enforcing a payment of about Rs.30/- on all sailing vessels entering Saudi territorial waters and the Saudi customs authorities started issuing receipts for the money which /•ii7D - 4 - which read as follows:- 'Received from a sum of Riyals 30 which is kept afe an /^anah'. This increase in Saudi port dues was said to be due to the recommendations of a Hejazi Inspector of Customs after a tour of inspection. The Hii old dues were from Rs. 2/8 to Rs. 4/8. Large boats continued to sail for Sauui ports^ with enhanced frei'ht charges, in spite of this large harbour tax but small boats ceased to ply. Abdul Aziz Zosaibi sehL a telegram to Ibn Saud on behalf of the Bahrain boat bwners, and Ibn Saud has now telegraphed Qosaibi and Abdul Aziz al Bassamto inform hia them that the new port dues have been waived. (ii) The Saudi Directorate General of Posts have agreed to the appointment of two men to carry mails; one from Al Khobar to Bahrain and the other from Bahrain to Al Khobar every day. The man.who arrives at Bahrain takes the mail to Al Khobar the following day and £he man who arrives at Al Khobar with the mail returns to Bahrain the following day and so on. ^ Their pay is to be Riyals 60 including the fee for entry into Bahrain which is about 7^ Riyals per month. The Al Khobar Postmaster is enquiring from Oosaibi if he can find a man for this job. (iii) On the 14th January, Ahmhd Mansouri, the Saudi wireless operator at Al Khobar, accompanied by Muhammad Mirdad and Abdullah Othaman^ Hejazi jpearl merchants, and another trader named Abdullah al Wazzan entered the Cable and Wireless premises and asked to s ee rouiid the station. Permission was refused by the Officer in Chhrge. . (iv) It is rumoured that two hien, one Italian and one Dutch living in Saudi Arabia have embraced Islam.

Petroleum Concessions Limited 3 Bahrain, returned from India on the 3rd January-. ^ • N ew Year Day On the 1st January the customary New Year visits were paid at^the Agency. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin : Isa al Khalifah. K.Cd.B, ? Ruler of Bahrain, together with his brothers and members of the family paid his call at 9.30 a.mo The Shaikh expressed his pleasure at the British successes in Libya and the successes of the Greeks, with British help, against the Italians in Albania. His health seems to be better this year than previously. At 10,30 a-mo a Manilas was held in the Agency Majlis Room where the Arab and other notables were present and listened to the Political Agent ; s annual speech. At 12 noon British and American residents paid their visits and drank the health of the King Emperor. The Agency flagstaff was decorated that day. 5. 3 Id al D uha ? Id al Duha was observed in Bahrain on the 8 th and 9th January. The Political Agent, accompanied by the Assistant Political Agent and the Indian Assistant, paid the Customary visits to His Highness the Shaikh, the leading members cf the Al Khalifah family and other Arab notables. 6 . Lo cal Affairs (i) The Political Agent has taken up with the State the question of the high rates charged for electric current - viz. 7 as. per unit. These high rates are the cause of discontent amongst the consumers here and an obstacle to others who would like to enjoy the benefits of electricity. (ii) A section of the Hindu merchants have recently been complaining against the Food Control. A meeting was arranged at the Customs at which the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Director of Customs who is also the Food Controller were present and the Political Agent brought the complainants to enable them to state their difficulties on the spot. The results though not conclusive serve to show that the Food Control Order is not being properly observed. The matter is being further pursued. (iii) On the 5th January, the Political Agent visited the local ice plant which is run by a prominent Arab merchant, Mr. Hussein Yateem. The plant is most efficiently run with the very minimum of expense. During winter the plant is in charge of one man who turns out sufficient ice to meet local demands. This is worked by a 25 k/w power plant which was installed by Mr. Hussein Yateem after he found himself unable to pay the excessive rates demanded by the State Electric Department, (iv) Khan Sahib Haji Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo has been very agitated recently over the cutting off of his water connec tions by the Manama Municipality owing to non-payment of water /-water rates by him. He claims that the well which is in the middle of the property recently sold by him to the State was not included in the sale. The State on the other hand assert that it was. Finally Usuf Kanoo approached Shaikh Hamad in the matter who has now ordered the resump tion of Yusuf Kanoo's water supply. (v) It is understood that Abdul Aziz Oosaibi aoproached Shaikh Hamad with a request for permission to sell his house at Hafa to Ibn Saud. It is thought possible that this might be an attempt to induce Shaikh Hamad to buy the pro perty. which is a white elephant, himself. It is known that the firm of Qosaibi are in low water; hence their desire to realise on the property in question. There may on the other hand be something behind the request, as members of the Saudi family occasionally do pass through Bahrain and they might feel the need of having a rest house here. It is learnt now that the Shaikhs are very much opposed to the sale of the house as they anticipate diffi culties in controlling the behaviour of the younger members of the Saudi family who might wish to use it. Nothing more has been heard of the proposal which has probably been abandoned, (vi) The new Agency tennis court has now been completed and promises to be quite satisfactory. (vii) Tfefe death was announced on the 3rd January of Shaikh Jassim bin Mahza, the Chief Sunni Oadhi, at the age, it is said, of 110 years. Shaikh Jassim had been Sunni Oadhi in Bahrain for over 40 years during the time of the late Shaikh f Isa. He was considered a very learned man and much respected by all communities. The bazaar was closed on that day as a mark of respect. 7. Persian Gulf Fighter Fund Contributions have amounted to Ps 27,744/- and £ 75/5. 8 . Public Ooinion The public are much pleased at the successes in Bardia and it is considered locally that the Italian army in Africa has already been broken. 9. Italian Broadca st It is reported that the following was broadcast from Rome on the 10th January : The majority of the shares of the Petroleum Company in Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf have changed into American hands, as Great Britain was obliged to sell 50,000 shares of this Company to the United States of America. When some weeks ago these Islands were bombed by Italian airmen these oil wells were still in British hands. 3# hoisting stars and stripes they obviously believe they are immune from further attacks. The transfer of shares also reveals according to Italian press increasing liquidation of British property in favour of United States of America. 10. Saud i Arabi a It is reported that two of the American geologists of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company Limited who were /-^ were working in an outlying camp about 15 miles west of . Hofuf heard the sound of low-flying aircraft overhead about 1 a.m. on the 8 th January. The machine appeared to be flying from the west toward Hofuf and the Coast. 11.

It now appears that it has broken lawn altogether, probably in consequence of representations by rai 'ci^us mere ra 283. E xpert Restriction s. The latest item which the Bahrain Government(followi i- the example of Saudi Arabia) have had to include in their expor , restrictions is sailing craft. A recent proclamation b^.m. .. the Shaikh declares that no sailing craft that has been in use during the poast two years may be sold to any for* igner .wishing to remove it from Bahrain. The reason for this 1 ncler is necessity of protecting the Bahrain pearling fleet irom the loss of dhows through the attractive prices offered by buyers from Kuweit and other Gulf States. 82 boats 11 the last tw.. years have been bought by foreigners and removed from Bahrein, including 9 pearling dhows in the past ton months, inis exporC trade in dhows is normally encouraged by the Bahrain Government but now, with the difficulty of obtaining timber from India, the time has come when unrestricted export would pruve injun 4$ to the interests cf the pearl industry . The embargo does not cover boats that have not yet been launched or that are made to order for foreigners.

Reference paras 133 (iii) (b) of Intelligence oummary No. 13 of 1942, and 174 (ii) of Intelligence Summary No.16 of 1942 in which it was reported that rupee currency notes were being exported from Bahrain to Kuwait in large quantities. This export still continues, and on October 6 th a motor launch left for Kuwait carrying notes to the value of nearly three lakhs of rupees. 209. Food Supplies q Bahrain . The position in regard to rice is still causing acute anxiety as there are no reserves of this commodity m Bahrain and consignments arriving are barely sufficient to ke3p pace with current consumption. The position has not improve the period under report during which only 1500 bags (excluding R.S. cargo) have arrived - a quantity sufucient to last to less than a week. The situation in regard to flour would b^ even more acute than the rice situation were it not for the Bahrain Government’s reserve of several hundred tons ^f^nadi^n wheat which is being used to supplement the inadequate supplies of flour being received from India. Authorised rations have been on the following scale:- Rice Wheat or Flour Sugar 12 lbs. per adult per mensem 4 lbs. ' 11 ” ' 4 lbs. ” ” ' With effect from October llth, the beginning of the current Arabic month, persons in possession of ration cards wil be entitled to increase their wheat or flour ration at the expense of their rice ration i.e. cut of a combined wheat or flour + rice ration of 16 lbs. per month, they c^n t^ke such proportion °s they wish in the form of whost or flour to the rice ration of 12 lbs. per month not being exceeded.- 2 - (3% The intention of this ^pp^ront concession is to reduce to seme extent consumption of rice, the compensating increase in the consumption of wheat or flour being met from the Government’s reserve of Canadian wheat,, Indian residents of Bahrain^ (ether than Bengalis) and a number of Persians and Jews are taking advantage of the concession. H.H. Shaikh Salman is deeply worried about the food situ ation, and can think and speak of little else. He sees in imagination his subjects streaming from Bahrain to avoid starvation in the same way as emigrants have during recent months been streaming from the Persian side of the Gulf° and he pictures to himself the shame in which he will be held.if, as an Arab ruler, he cannot keep his people from starvation. .The Shaikh is wise enough, however, (and proud enough) to confide his forebodings to few, and in public he pours scorn on the alarmist talk which is becoming increasingly common in Manama and Muharraq. 210. F ood Supplies. Saudi Arabia . News that an expedition is shortly to scour the deserts of Arabia in pursuit of locusts has filtered through to the mainland; and a visitor from Hasa, discussing^the ex pedition and its objects, remarked somewhat plaintively w e eat locusts, you know”. 211. Dril ling on Hawar Island . In October 1941 the Bahrain Petroleum Company were given permission to drill holes on the main Hawar Island in order to obtain information of the geological structure there. The Bahrain Government were particularly pleased at the in ~ elusion of this item in the Company's drilling^programme both because it afforded further evidence of the British Govern ment's acceptance of their claim to sovereignty over the Hawar Islands, and because they hoped thereby to secure a water supply on the main island. At the beginning of October the Company informed the Bahrain Government of their intention to start drilling operations immediately after the end of Ramadhan. Since the institution of drilling ^operations so near to his territory would undoubtedly have incensed the Shaikh o . to an inordinate degree, and would have prompted many awkward questions at a time when awkward questions are particularly unwelcome (the Qatar Oil Company's drilling equipment is in unwelcome v one '^eiocu v-,^ ^ n ,, „ L .JkUhG process of being loaded for shipment to India) the Bahr .1 9'k* rtrW T-,_4. -1 ^^t.n nnet.nonn indefinitely their 1 . r W* I. j v. ^7, y^V: •. 2120 Broadcastin g Petroleum Company were asked to postpone indefinitely t ' n ^ ir drilling programme on and near the Hawar Islands. The Company readily agreed to the postponement asked for, and it only re- mains now to devise an explanation acceptable to the Shaikh of Bahrain for the deferment of a project in which he takes sc k*.„n a personal interest. r Bahrain has been mentioned several times during , last fortnight in Arabic broadcasts from Berlin, Bari and Tokio. Cne announcement was to the effect that a Dictator had been appointed in Bahrain, and that he Wr.s shmr ly to be joined by an American Military Dictator. All three stations stressed the dominance of American influence in the island owing to America's oil interests there. 213 . i; (i) On October 11th and 12th the Political ^J^nt made the customary round of 'Id calls. When ho called ° n the Shaikh he was accompanied by major Hewitt, ^aj 9 who w-s assumed by Bedouin visiters to be a highly placed British General. It is not unlikely that Major .Hewitt.is the nucleus around which the story of.a 'British Military Dictator (vide para 212 above) has been built up. ^ ±)</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00014e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3768</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00014e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3768</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/52 (2) 'Persian Gulf, Diaries: Bahrain News and Intelligence Reports'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-01-10T22:40:40</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (473 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 475; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
