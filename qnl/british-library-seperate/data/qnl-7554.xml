Numerous copies of the proposed draft agreement can be found through out the file, while printed copies of the final agreements can be found on folios 112-174 (Kuwait) and 175-177 (Bahrain); no copies of the agreement concluded with the Sultan of Muscat can be found within the file. The file also contains copies of special authorisations issued by the authorities at Bahrain, Kuwait, and Muscat, permitting access to their respective territories and airspace to aircraft of Imperial Airways, Indian Trans-Continental Airways, and Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services (QANTAS).The authorisations issued by the authorities at Kuwait include both Arabic and English translation.The main correspondents are: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven William Fowle; Percy Gordon Loch, acting; and Hugh Weightman, acting), the Political Agent at Bahrain, the Political Agent at Kuwait, the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat, officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, and officials of the India Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Gwadur Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Bahrain Civil Air Agreement (1934)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Kuwait Civil Air Agreement (1934)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Civil Air Agreement (1934)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000206#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000206#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000206#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000206#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
