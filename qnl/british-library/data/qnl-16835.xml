It explains the Resident's position that provisions regarding ship flags and papers should be enforced more strictly than previously. It also outlines a proposed procedure for issuing the required papers, along with proposed procedures for handling vessels without the required paperwork (in other words, registers or port clearance), or that are otherwise acting suspiciously.It is explained that the Resident considers the extent the General Treaty authorises the British to enforce its provisions is unclear. It further explains that none of the measures outlined will be effective in dealing with 'actual piracy', which will require more punitive measures, but it is hoped they will have a preventative effect.The Resident's concern regarding the difficulties the British will face in the event of war between the parties of the treaty, or war involving non-signatories is also outlined; the British have no right to interfere in wars declared between Arab chieftains, but cannot easily separate this from what they term piracy. It is noted that it is the Resident's opinion that British ability to suppress piracy in the Persian Gulf through sea power alone remains doubtful, though it is his intention to encourage other Arab chieftains to sign the treaty.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
