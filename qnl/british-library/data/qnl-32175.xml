Negotiations for oil rights in respect of the 'Bahrein unallotted area' (i.e. that portion of the Sheikh’s territory, islands, waters, etc., which are not already leased to the Bahrein Petroleum Company) were suspended hy the Sheikh of Bahrein last May for a period of one year. There are two known competitors viz. (1) The (jC Standard Oil Company of California, who'to the present Bahrein lease a subsidiary company knoy/n as the * • ■ Petroleum Company, and (2) Petroleum Concessions Limited, who, with the support of His Majesty’s Government have obtained concessions at Qatar and in Muscat and are now endeavouring to obtain concessions from the Trucial x Sheikhs. The area covered by the lease now being operated by the Bahrein Petroleum Company is contained in the map enclosed in the envelope flagged A below. As will be seen it includes the bulk of the main Island of Bahrein but does not include the Island of Muharraq, territorial waters and certain other islands, reefs, shoals, etc., which belong, or are thought to belong^ to the Sheikh of Bahrein. At one time both competitors wanted 'all or none'; but both have now withdrav/n from this position and it is understood that the Sheikh is disposed to divide the area, giving part to the American group and part to Petroleum Concessions Limited. We do not know what the division .S' is likely to be, but Petroleum Concessions Limited have heard a rumour that the Sheikh intends to give the Hawar group of islands (which lie to the south-west of Bahrein off the coast of Qatar) to them and the remainder to their rivals. This will not suit Petroleum Concessions/Concessions Limited at all and the area for which they hope to obtain a concession is that shown in the two maps which are attached to their draft concession (flagged ’B*). For ease of reference the combined area is marked (in red ink) on the attached sketch map (flagged , C’). This proposed concession area includes certain islands etc., which are claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein, but whose ownership has not yet been definitely determined. These are : - (a) In leased area No. 1 - the islands (perhaps better described as shoals or reefs) known as Fasht-al-Jarim and Khor Fasht. Although these islands lie closest to Bahrein they are not far from the mainland of Saudi Arabia and the possibility they they are oil bearing might very soon bring a claim from Ibn Saud. (b) In leased area No.2 - the Hawar group of islands and Fasht Dibal. On the evidence available we have provisionally agreed that these islands belong to Bahrein, but since they lie close to the Qatar A £ov**-i-jLA4AXJL UH. iSUudU I** .O^ojJco j Peninsula (particularly the Hawar group) they might /3^U-vc*« to well be claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar. If such a claim is advanced it will have to be considered. Petroleum Concessions Limited have strongly pressed T f~T | ^ i a view that questions of ownership should not delay the resumption of negotiations in regard to the unallotted area and izi consultation with Sir Trenchard Fowle and the Foreign Office, the Company have been informed that so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, it is open to them to apply to the Sheikh of Bahrein (at the appropriate orw time) for a concession for the two areas indicated in the maps attached to the draft concession, on the understanding; that any decision subsequently taken with regard to the sovereignty or ownership of any of the islands, reefsMinute Paper. \ \0 Department. or shoals included in the proposed concession areas v/ill only hold good to the extent that His Majesty’s Government are in a position to take and e a decision^ i,e, as between one $ Prdi^cpLci jfcegge and another,and cannot he held to preclude H.M’js. f^C- ^ (fcv ££****»* r&amp;J Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign pov/er which may hereafter put forward a claim to the islands, reefs or shoals, if His Majesty’s Government in their sole discretion think it expedient to admit that claim. Hitherto our attitude as regards the unallotted area has been one of impartiality between the two competing companies, but at a recent interview with the representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited (see Part A of the Record flagged at ’D’ below) Lord Cadman . expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government would feel able to use their influence with the Sheikh of Bahrein to accept the Company’s proposals,which he thought were perfectly fair having regard to the area at present leased to the ml fred. He was promised that his view’s would receive consideration the question is tyj&amp;AAAAte&amp;v submitted for orders. To save time (as the matter is of some urgency) Sir Trenchard Powle’s views were obtained before he returned to the Gulf. Sir Trenc hard Powle is strongly of opinio n that His Majesty’s Government should give some support to Petroleum Concessions Limited and that this support might most conveniently take the form of informing the Sheikh that the share of the area which Petroleum Concessi ons Limited are now aski ng f or is_ a reasonable one.

'—^ u faqls* rfrrU~*-&gt;. NOTE. The question of the future employment of Major Frank Holmes in the Persian Gulf was aisoussea at a meeting at Britannic House on the 25th April at which Lord Cauman, Mr. Fraser, Mr. Skliros, Sir Trencharu Fowle ana Mr. Symon were present. Mr. Skliros said that his understanding of his conversation with Mr. Walton on 9th Lecember was that, while H.M.G. objectea to the continued employment of Major Holmes on the Trucial Coast, these objections uid not apply to Bahrein and Koweit. He said that soon after his conversation with Mr. Walton he hau left for Bagoau and it was while he was there that he pursued the idea of employing Major Holmes at Bahrein in connection with the negotiations for the 'Unallotted Area'. He haa accordingly asked the London office of the Company to send out Major Holmes 'provide^ he was fit ana that the Inaia Office saw no objection . When Major Holmes came to Bagua^ he haa assumed that it was with the approval of the India Office. This apparently was not the case. On learning that H.M.G. were not prepared to allow Major Holmes to act on behalf of the Company at Bahrein he haa immediately withdrawn Major Holmes, who since then haa severed his official connection with the Company. Mr. Skliros then went on to say that because of his influence with the Sheikh of Bahrein ana the Sheikh’s family the Company were still anxious that Major Holmes should act for them in connection with the forthcoming negotiations; but if this was not acceptable to H.M.G. he would not press the point/point, and would try anu. tie Major Holmes up so as to prevent him from acting on behalf of their rivals. Sir Trenchard Fowle then said that he coula only confirm what the Company haa already been tol^, viz. that as a negotiator Major Holmes was persona non grata to H.M. G.; and he went on to point out that if, as appeared likely, the Sheikh had already ma^e up his mind to uivioe up the unallotted area between the American Company ana tetroleum Concessions Ltd. the need for having Major Holmes on the spot would not aris$. Mr. Skliros then asked whether the objections to Major Holmes applied to Koweit as well as to other parts of the Persian Gulf. He was informed by Sir Prencharu Fowle that this point would be considered. Lora Caanan said that he was prepared to accept the position as regarus Major Holmes ana would not press for reasons; but, as regards what Sir Trenchard Fowle had saia about the Sheikh dividing up the area, i^ was possible that the Sheikh's i^eas might fall short of what the Company wanted, and it was in this direction that personal influence with the Sheikh and his family itiight prove to be the decisive factor. He said the Company attached considerable importance to securing the area shown in Map 1, and leaving aside the question of obtaining oil they were most anxious to prevent their American rivals from extending their influence in this direction. He therefore hoped that H.M.G. would see their way to influencing the Sheikh to accept their proposals. Lora Cacman was promised that his views would be submitted for consideration. As regards procedure. Sir Trencharu Fowle said that nothing cotH.l be done until the Sheikh had intimated/Minute Paper. Department. intimated that he was reauy to re-open negotiations. In reply to Lora Cabman, Sir Trenoharu said that if the Company wanted to send out a negotiator from t iungiana he had no aoubt that the Sheikh ooula be v persuade^, to wait until the negotiator arrived. lor. Skliros then said that it was possible that as he was returning to Iraq shortly he might go to Bahrein himself to conduct the negotiations personally.fZ:2904M- ' Draft Paper I ^ POLITICAL Department.

SIGN OFJ’IGE, S.W.l 25th April, 1938 (E 2288/413/91) Immediate My dear Gibson We have been considering your letter P.Z. 2727/38 of the 20th April about the resumption of negotiations for the ’’Bahrein unallotted area”. In the light of the further discussions which you have held with the representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited we agree generally, subject to a suggestion by Beckett, referred to below, to the line which the India Office propose to take in their reply to the Company regarding their not further postponing their approach to the Sheikh, Beckett has made certain suggestions as regards the wording of the second part of Article 1 of the Draft Lease, a copy of which formed an enclosure to your letter of the 7th April and which I now return, and I cannot do better than send you a copy of his minute herewith. If his suggestion/ J.P. Gibson, Esgt. 2** APR 1938 INDIA OFFICE\ suggestion as regards the substitution of the words n submerged land' for 'waters' is adopted there will of course be no need to use in your reply to the Company the words underlined in paragraph 2 of your letter. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal and Starling.COPY (E 2288/413/91) rS Cyr eU^*) (VWfO There are two points on which I should like to say something, the first concerns the Hawar group of islands* The position here is as I understand it, that these islands probably belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but may conceivably vr belong to the Sheikh of Qatar or even to Ibn Saud * The company wish to secure the rights over these islands by this concession on the assumption that they belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. If they belong to the Sheikh of Qatar they have already got rights over them under their agreement with Qatar and if they should turn out to belong to Ibn Saud they realise that neither this proposed agreement nor the agreement with Qatar will give them any rights there and that they are not getting any guarantees by H.M.Gr* that a claim by Ibn Saud will not be recognised by them* This being the position, it seems to me to be better to word the ’'Secondly” in Article 1 of the draft concession as follows: 'The whole of that portion of the Sheikh’s dominions (leased area No. 2) including axl islands, reefs, shoals and waters belonging to the Sheikh within the following boundary limits .....' The boundary limits which are defined by geographical co-ordinates clearly go round the Hawar group of islands and therefore if they belong to the Sheikh the concession covers them. On the other hand, the fact that they are not mentioned in this way by name avoids the difficulty that the concession definitely contains a statement that the islands do belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. This way of treating the matter seems to me to be/be more appropriate in view of the circumstances indicated above# Then there is the point about territorial waters which arises as I understand it in this way. The proposed concession refers to all waters within the proposed leased area, and the area includes waters outside 3 mile limit, but it cannot be intended that the oil should actually be extracted from the sea water and the intention I think must be to obtain the right to extract oil from the land under the sea within this area and this point is relevant because so far as the water is concerned not only does the Sheikh have no right over water outside the three mile limit but also in the ordinary way he cannot acquire by occupation or prescription any sovereignty over such water. On the other hand, as regards the sea bed and the land under the bed, although the Sheikh has at present no right to such land outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. And indeed both pearl fisheries and Cornish tin mines which extend beyond the three mile limit are held to have been appropriated in this way. Consequently, I should think that it would be better to substitute for the word 'waters' the words 'submerged land', so that the phrase would run 'islands, reefs, shoals and submerged land belonging to the Sheikh comprised ' The effect of this would be that the company would get the right to the land below the sea immediately within the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as they had appropriated it, its appropriation by the company having the effect I think of also vesting/vesting it in the Sheikh from the point of view of sovereignty since the company are working under a concession from the Sheikh, At any rate the insertion of the phrase ’’belonging to the Sheikh' gets over any difficulties from our point of view as regards territorial waters.

Y&amp;*ur3 sincerely. &lt;S4(i.) J. P. GIBSONRecord of an Informal ieetin^ held at the India office on the 12th April, to discuss the activities of Petroleum Concessions, Limited on the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. PRESENT: ^r. R. T. Peel (in the Chair) Sir T.Fowle ) ) Mr. Lewisohn ) Representing Mr. Gibson ) India Office. ) Petroleum ) Mr. Longrigg ) Concessions Mr. Symon ) ) Limited. Mr. Longrigg opened the discussion by saying that there were three matters which he wished to raise, viz: - A. The position in regard to the ^oweit neutral Zone; B. The position in regard to the Bahrein Unallotted area; C. The position on the Trucial Coast, etc. 2. vith regard to A. (the Koweit Neutral Lone), r. *ongrigg said that as a result of our refusal to allow 1 ajor Holmes to act as their negotiator at Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast, ajor Holmes had severed his connection with Petroleum Concessions, Jutd., and the S' Company were afraid that he might now resume his connection with the California Company. fajor Holmes was now at Loweit to consult with the Bheik regarding the Neutral Lone and owing to his influence with the Sheik they were apprehensive lest he might persuade the SheiK to give the concession to American interests before PetroleumConcessions Ltd. had been given a further opportunity of putting forvard their proposals. Mr. Longrigg then went on to express the hope that Hie lajtsty e Government might feel their wuy to discourage American interests, or at least ensure that the Sheik did not cede his oil rights in the neutral Zone until retroleurn Concessions Ltd. had been given a fair opportunity of competing. He was promised that the Company's views would receive consideration. 3. -Vith regard to B. (the Bahrein Unallotted Area , Mr. Longrigg referred to his previous call on the 31st arch, at which he had left a copy of the Company's draft lease relating to parts of the Bahrein Unallotted nrea and he said that here again the Company were concerned about the future intentions of Major Holmes, who was fully informed as to their proposals. The Company were satisfied that there was little chance of the Sheik of Bahrein giving them the whole of the Unallotted ^rea and that they had been led t &gt; believe that the Sheik intended to give everything except the Hawar Group of islands to the .imericans. For this reason they had departed from their original intention to compete for the whole of the unallotted Area; but while they were prepared to leave the rnairL island out of their plans, they wanted rather more than the Hawar Group and he hoped that His Majesty's Government would feel able to support the Company on the basis of the drift concession. &gt;;ir Trenchard Fovle intervened at this stage to point out that the Company s proposed concession area included certain islands (i.e. the Hawar Group and Fasht jibal) whose ownership as between Bahrein and ^atar had n )t yet been clearly determined. While on the evidence at present available to His Majesty’s4-0 3 . ^. /'Aw ^ C HJLS- - 9l~ '{* c &amp;c.h~ LfUuU 2) cU St^t: 4 oL ^ irr ojmlo- ^ uU ^~ , Ik. ^ aL luij * ^ - n^i ^ /A. frm/k ^JvX ^ ru^. f* ttJ AfYU*«*» L ' • ^0 Government these islands belonged to Bahrein there was reason to suppose that the oheik of ^atar might wish to advance claims to them and he thought that it might be preferable to ask the bheik of Bahrein to postpone the resumption of negotiations for a short period (say two or three months) in order that the question of ownership could be finally determined. This suggestion had been put to Lord Cadman in a recent conversation and it was understood that His Lordship was agreeable. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that the Company were opposed to any postponement and he personally thought it would be a pity to put ideas of ownership into the mind of the Sheik of ^atar. He pointed out, moreover, that if enquiries showed that the islands in question belonged to the Sheik .y - of ,atar, they would be included in the concession which the Company had already obtained from that Ruler; and he said that by entering into negotiations with the Sheik of Bahrein for them, the Company were merely running the risk of paying twice for the same thing. The Company were prepared to take this chance and v.ould definitely prefer to carry on with the negotiations without any postponement. Sir Trenchard Fowl® said that he had not appreciated the latter point and that in the circumstances he was inclined to withdraw his suggestion for postponing the negotiations, dr. Lee l wound up this part of the discussion by saying that the views put forward on behalf of the Company would be carefully considered and that a decision would be given as soon as possible. 4 . »Vith regard to C. (the Trucial Coast, etc.), Mr. Longrigg said that there were two separate points,viz: (1) Concessions; (2) Exploration.ith regard to ( 1 ) (Concessions), the present position was that the Company had obtained concessions in respect of Debai and Sharjah; but so far all efforts to induce the remaining sheiks to come into line had proved unavailing. As far as was reasonably possible, the Company had met the various demands put forward by the Sheiks and he thought that fully adequate terms had been offered; but the Sheiks seemed to be completely out of hand and appeared to be convinced that eventually they could get whatever terms they liked to ask. * state of deadlock had been reached and the Company felt that unless Hie Majesty’s Government were prepared to intervene, the only alternative open to them was to temporarily withdraw their negotiators. Asked for his vie vs, Sir Trenchard Fowle said he thought that if the iheiks were left alone^ for/eix months, they would^come round and accept the Company’s offers. Mr. Longrigg said, however, that in oil matters waiting usually resulted in big a er demands and he thought that delay in coming to terms might make it more difficult for the Sheiks to withdraw from their present position. If, however, the Political Resident advised waiting, the Company would of course accept hie advice, but they hoped that it would be found possible to do something to hasten matters. Mr. Lewlsohn t hen aeked_if the Company could regard their present privileged position as watertight and was informed that for the present, at any rate, they had no need to worry on this score. Mr.Lewisohn then went on to s^y that he thought that the Political agreement might have something to do with the Sheik of Rae al Khaimah’s refusal to come to terms and he asked whether Hir Majesty’s Goverament regarded it as essential/yt 5 . to obtain the oheik’f agreement. Mr. Longrigg agreed with his colleague and euggeste i that the terns of the agreement were sifficiently binding on the Company without bringing in the oheiks. M r. Peel pointed out, however , that as two of the tSheike, namely Debai and the oh ajpj ah, had recognised the agreements, it might be difficult not to follow the same procedu re in the case of the others , but he promised that the question would be re-examined. as regards exploration, r. Longrigg said that from the Company’s point of view, the present situation was completely unsatisfactory. He said that although much of the territory concerned could probably be written off as valueless, some parts appeared to have definite interest and they must see it all. Up to the present the Company’s efforts to visit certain ’’interesting” areas through the medium of the Trucial Sheiks , had oeen unsuccessful and the Company had formed the conclusion that it would probably be best to leave the Trucial oheiks alone for the time being and to try and operate through Muscat. Mr. Longrigg mentioned in this connection that he had seen the Sultan during the latter’s recent visit to London and had been told that in addition to certain parts of luscat territory , the Uultan might be able to arrange for a party to reach Baraimi (which the Sultan hem belonging to him) through Muscat. Mr. L ongrigg said thft this suggestion seemed to offer greater promise of getting something done and he enquir ed whether it might not be possible for Hie Majesty’s Government to co-opera te with the Sultan. He was promised that the point would be considered.5. Sir Treuchard Fowle mentioned that during hie recent conversation with f.ord Cadman he had been asked to suggest the name of a suitable person to act for Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. in connection with the forthcoming negotiations at Bahrein and Koweit. Sir T. Fo le said that normally he would hesitate to give advice, but ae the present circumstances were somewhat peculiar he was prepared to do so. The names which occurred to him were Messrs. Longrigg, Lermitte and Packer ani he said that so far as the local Political authorities were concerned, all these gentlemen would be acceptable. He also thought that they would be acceptable to the Rulers concerned. 1R1)L, OFFICE 12th April 1933TELEPHONE : NATIONAL 3M2 TELEGRAMS : INLAND : PETCONCESS, FINSQUARE, LONDON FOREIGN : PETCONCESS, LONDON &amp; t CODES : BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE BENTLEY'S COMPLETE PHRASE WITH OIL SUPPLEMENT LOMBARD 44 MENT PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED DIRECTORS : Sir John Cadman, G.C.M.G.

We think it should be made clear to the company that any decision taken with regard to the sovereignty or ownership of the islands only holds good to the extent that His Majesty’s Government are in a position to take and enforce a decision i.e. as between one Protected State and another, and cannot be held to preclude His Majesty’s Government from admitting the sovereignty of any foreign Power which may hereafter/ J.P.Gibson Esq.hereafter put forward a claim to the islands if His Majesty Government in their sole discretion think it expedient to admit that claim. This may be a purely formal reservation in the present case, but we do not want to tie our hands against the unforeseen, in the way that we tied them over Jebel Naksh by undertaking obligations to a private company about the territory of an Arab ruler.Seojet &amp; Confidential. r&gt;. 0, Ho.

I returned his call at the agency on the 2?th, cmd he soon begtn to be, appaiently, confiding. 4. TTe s^ict that hie object this winter wf a to obtain concessions, for the X.P.C., for three of the fineat potential oil fields in the world. He was sorry he wr s working for the t.P.C., as it was not wholly British, but nhtt could he do. He would much prefer to work for a British Company end he had recently interested two Jritish groups in the ctam aohenes. ?7ere X tried to mka him explain why he had not continuedwith them, ^e said ttv^t it was owing to the Bed Line Agreement, and then turned for e time to other subjects. 5. Averting to oil, ho said 'that do I want? -d[ have got raoney^. 'A Peerage is what I want*. Hero he gav&lt;? a brief chuckle, but I wee left with the impression that it was not entirely fhoetiousnoss. H. eightein, Hsquire, I.C.S.* Officiating Political Resident in tlie Persian Oulf, at l&gt;ahrain.6 . Ho t on B&amp;owed me his plans printed tar him he at Id by 'Allen' or Alsu' in ^ant. (They were blue prints based on the Admiralty cherts) (a) One area is S3 miles Horth and r&gt;outh, by 17 miles 'ast and Test, covering the FASIfT AJ JARIM pearl banks, wltti a corner (som^here about BHTXRAXEA to BUDIYA) of Bahrain for neoeaaary storing of material and for camps. '‘e spoke most confidently about the valuable nature of the FA3HT as a geological 'structure'. (b) next plan showed cm equally large area taking in an oblong block dofl^n the jabrain boy i.e. between Bah re in Islands and ,^atar. (c) I asked where was the third plan, but he said that it w s not ready yet and did not volunteer the location of the area. He led me to believe that the I.^.C. had approached the India Office on th © subject of these concessions, snd thet as soon as the Hon’ble the Resident returned frc»m London he hoped to get down to Bahrain, where he said, the Sheikh knew about the scheme in principle, and had conversed about it with him before now. 0 . He asked me what wua the position about rl^its at sea in th© Persian Gulf, and before I could reply said that in these days it was no good trying to keep the Gulf exclusively Ibr the British. How would we like it if , sons for&lt; 3 ®^ »power or neighbouring country juet came in and insisted on itftving this area? ire could do nothing. The sea was free. He ftp &gt;©ared to be about to become extremely upset, but suddenly quietened down. 'Iraight go to rbn .seud', do auid, but then as quickly added 'No X would not go to thet asm? and gt-ve a shudder.10 . Thin i« the gist of what he told rae about his projects in tbs Gulf this winter. 11. Incidentally he was rather a musing about a gold mine in Austria which he hod 'hawked” in America and London, and got rid of 'Just in time' 'X expect they are after me now' he said. Generally he seams very full of life and fitter than last year. 12. He has just left for Iraq for some days, possibly in connection with the taking up of the are© just North of Kuwait, which owing to oil being found hers, Is now become a matter of interest in the oil world.

It seems that subsequently to the instructions sent to Mr. Skliros Major Holmes has severed his connection with P.C.L. The Company , however, will endeavour to retain Holmes, not because Lord Cadman trusts him, but because he is anxious as to what Holmes might do outside the Coy. Lord Cadman is anxious lest Holmes gets in with the California Coy. He^would be exposed to criticism by the other (foreign) elements in P.C.L. if the Coy. failed to get the concession at Bahrein after having got rid of Holmes, especially if Holmes got it for the California Coy. It is the possibility of oil under the sea in the neighbourhood of Bahrein which makes the concession important (see the call we had from representatives of the Anglo-Persian in regard to this). I said that as regards the concession our attitude was one of impartiality between the two Companies which have made applications to the Sheikh, and/and reminded Lord Cadman that the Sheikh has said that he will not negotiate with either till next May. As regards Holmes, I said that, owing to our own objections to Holmes, I thought that we should certainly prevent his dealing with the Sheikh (even if we are unable to prevent his going to Bahrein). &gt;'Y -Draft Paper, p.z. 2412/38 political Department r IMMEDIATE T.

Last May (see enclosure to our printed letter No,P.Z.3824/37 of the v/unc 18th July, 1937) Belgrave informed the Political Agent, Bahrein, that the Sheikh had decided to postpone all discussions and negotiations regarding r&gt; the unallotted area for one year, and, as you will see from the enclosed copy of a telegram dated 31st March, 1938, from the officiating Political Resident the Bahrein Governnent have recently confirmed their intention not to resume negotiations until the year's interval ends. In the normal way, therefore, we may expect negotiations to recommence sometime after 1st May, but, as will be apparent from the ensuing, a complication has arisen. 3.

Longrigg called here on behalf of Petroleum/mmm m / 4 Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in order to leave the enclosed copy of the ^-5 draft lease relating to parts of the M Bahrein unallotted area” and to say • that the Company wished to know whether have any objection to their applying to the Sheikh (at the appropriate time) for a concession n over the two areas indicated in the maps attached to the draft concession^ The Company are anxious for an early decision in order that everything should be in readiness for the time when the Sheikh indicates his willingness to open discussions. We have taken the opportunity of Powle’s presence here to discuss the question with him, and I do not think I can do in' ^ better than to send you a copy of our Minutes. Prima facie Powle’s proposal to get the Sheikh to postpone negotiations until the ownership of the Ha war and other islands has been decided appears to be the best solution, and, subject to any views which the Foreign Office ( may have to offer, it is proposed to proceed on the lines indicated in para. 4 of his Note. 4. A s the matter is of some urgency we should be grateful for an early reply, and in due course we shall he glad to have your advice in regard to the/Draft Paper Department 5^ the point dealt with in para.3 of Symon’s note. 5.

Mr. Belgrade, after consulting His Highness t informed Vr. Long- rigg thi« morning tnat the :iiiaikh was not prepared to re open the matter at pre^jont. Ur. Lcngrigg informed me tiiat he was very disappointed hy this decision as he had come a long way with the definite intention of trying to push forward that matter. He felt that he ought to have been allowed to raise the matter in conversation with His Highness himself end ho did not quite like being, as it ware, warned off. I was able to assure him that it was net a question of bein' denied access to His Highness for the purpose of discussing business, but that Mr. Belgrave had merely interpreted te him the decision of Fis Highness the Shaikh which I myself knew to b» quite definite. 2.

Banrain unallotted area.1 Minute Paper. f4 ! j 9 ?, ■■j j political Department. ..j w W 3]^ p+u*J£) 3 cn\L n In considering what portion of the Bahrein ’'unallotted area' they should apply for, Petroleum Concessions Ltd. have taken into account the known desire of the Sheikh to divide the area Between their Company and the Bahrein Petroleum Company. It is for this reason that they have for the moment given up the idea of applying for the whole of the’Hina Hot ted area'. 2. Maps showing the two areas which they hope to obtain are attached at the back of the draft concession; for ease of reference I attach a rough sketch map shov/ing the total area covered by the two maps. 3. The proposed concession area includes certain * non-territorial waters, and it is suggested that v/e should seek the advice of the Foreign Office as to whether there is any objection to this. 4. Apart from a number of very small islands and reefs, the proposed concession area also includes the following islands:- (a) Fasht al Jarin and Khor Fasht, which lie to the North of the Bahrein Island; (b) Fasht Dibal, which lies to the North-East of the main Bahrein Island; and (c) the Hawar group of islands, v/hich lie South-East of the main Bahrein Island off the coast of Qatar. 5. All the above are claimed by the Bahrein Government. The Ruler of Qatar has not been consulted in the matter, but the Political Agent, Bahrein, considers it possible that he might claim Fasht JDibal and that it is practically certain that he would claim the Hawar group. As regards the latter, it will be recalled that the question of the ownership of the H474B Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP ^ .Ha war Islands was considered in 1936 (see P.Z.4582/36 in Colin.30/123) in connection with the earlier negotiations for the Bahrein ’’unallotted area”. The decision then reached was ’’that on the evidence then available these Islands appeared to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein, and that the burden of disproving his claim lay on other potential claimants'. This decision was communicated verbally to Mr. Belgrave (by Mr. Walton) on the 16th July, 1936, and it was explained to him that it would be impossible to give a final ruling without knowing whether the Sheikh of Qatar has a claim, and hearing it if he has one. Hitherto no attempt has been made to determine the sovereignty of the islands in question as between Bahrein and Qatar ■,Ui in view of the manner in which it has been raised by Petroleum Concession Ltd. , a decision cannot be delayed further, and as a first step it is suggested that we should obtain the views of Sir Trenchard Powle.Mr.Synon, Ee our discussion and your note of the 4th April* V CAntC 1 Until the ’’unallotted area” cj&amp;rZs into the front of the picture there no object in H.M.G. giving a deiinite decision on the ownership of Hawar and this question i could be left iAthe position described in para. 5 of your note. ’t f 2 . Now, however, that the P.C.L. want to commence negotiations with the Sheikh concerning this area in which Hawar is situated, H.M.G. will have to give s, decision as the Company will want to know before entering on negotiations whether Hawa.r does or does not Delong to Bahrein. 3. The same remarks mutat is mutandis apply to the island of Easht Dibal. 4 . I suggest the following action:- (a) a letter to be written by me as Political Resident under instructions from H.M.G. to the Shaikh of Qatar, informing him that in connection with negotiations which certain Companies are about to commence the question of the ownership of Hawar and Pasht Dibal must be decided. On the evidence at present available to H.M.G. these islands appear to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. H.M.G., however, have reason to believe that he, the Sheikh of Qatar, may wish to advance claims to these islands. If so he should submit these claims to H.M.G. within a certain period (say two months) from the date of the letter, after which no claims should be considered. (b) a letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein enclosing a copy of the letter to the Sheikh of Qatar and explaining that when the latter’s reply has been/'been received it would te communicated to him, the Sheikh of Bahrein. The latter will then have an opportunity of rebutting the claim of the Sheikh of Q,atar should the latter advance one. (c) a second letter to be sent to the Sheikh of Bahrein referring to letter (b) and asking him if he would be good enough to postpone negotia.tions with the Companies concerned until the ownership of Hawar and Fasht Dibal have been decided. (d) a letter to be sent to the p.C.L. and to Bapco. informing them of the action taken. 5. The possible objection to the above line of action is that it may put ideas into the head of the Sheikh of Qatar. However, I am pretty sure that the ideas are there already and we cannot risk the muddle that would ensue if, after the P.C.L. and Bapco. had commenced negotiations on the assumption that the islands belong to Bahrein, the Sheikh of Qatar were to come forward with a sound claim. Apart from this it is only fair,I think, to Qatar, to give him an opportunity of having his say. 6. From the political point of view it will suit quite w'ell if we give Hawar to Bahrein, as this will balance our previous decision of giving Zubara to Qatar. 7. With regard to para.3 of your note.

I understand that ir. Belgrave did not mean this to be taken in any way as offi- | ci&amp;I and that it w&amp;s in the nature of a private co«mhUc&amp;- * tion In order to obtain the private views of the Company, 4# Thera appear to be three points to be dealt with when consid ring Petroleum Concessions Limited*s letter under/-(3 17 unaer reference* m they firstly, the ^ssuspclon that ;iib&amp;r«h is p&amp;rt of the territory concession for which has hcen granted to the* by the Shalitii of Qet&amp;r in the terms of the Qatar Conces«lon| secondly* Petroleum Con cessions Limited 1 s sug gestion that they sight emphasise the uord ^Islands” in order to avoid any complication which might arise by the mention of Zubarah in the Con cession for the unallotted area; md thirdly, the poli tical effect of the inclusion of any clause which in any way restricts the Oil Company*s development of the Zuburah area, 5, fhe first point raised by the Company is the assump tion that Uis Majesty* s Qoverriiaent agree that Zhb&amp;r&amp;h is pas?t of th^ territory the Concession for whleh nas already been granted to them by the Sliaikh of Qatar, They b* 3 € their assumption on the fact that His Majesty’s -loverament have ratified that Concession, «diich is said to contain the description of the area covered and to have a map at tached, Article 2 of the Qat^r Oil Concession is presumably the one which is meant when they refer to the description of the area and it reads as follows:- ’’The State of Qatar means the whole area over which the ChaiMh rules ana which is marked on the north of the line dr&amp;tm on the map attach ed to tills Agreement.* At this same time when the Qatar Concession was ratified the question of barah was dormant and it hsd been dor mant since about 1905. The Shaikh of Bahrain did not raise the question and naturally the Shaikh of Qatar, ttxo claims the Zubarsh area, aid not open the question, as £ result of this. His Majesty*s Government failed to consider tne possibility of the Shaiich of Bahrain reviving his old claims/-u claltiiS to iubarsii i:nd tm* mors rewot* posalbility of * ui» being tbXe to tub st anti ate such cl^i^a. It vas unfortunate th&amp;t tills point was ov^-rlooked at the time, but overlooked it was. and It r«?a&amp;ln* for us to see whether the ratification of the Oil igreeifisnt in any way conaitted His Majesty*a GoverniEent with regard to the Gefinltion of the &amp;r«* ’♦under the mle of the Shaikh of Qatar.' from an ex^idmtion of ivrticle 1! of the Qatar Oil Cono^s^ion I inclined to ths? view that His Majes ty* s Government are in no way cowsdizoa, for the st-te of Qatar Is defined as being 'the whole area over vftilch * the Shaikh rules and which is ffi«rk«d on the north of the line drawn on the m&amp;p attached to this igrccssent.' If the Shaikh of Bahrain eventually succeeds in proving his Cil&amp;l&amp; to the area &amp;norrn as £uberah then ipso facto the Shaikh of Qatar eanaot s^ld to rule ever tn&amp;t area and, therefore, that area cannot be considered &amp;s part of the state of Qatar. However, I co not think it ad- ( vls&amp;ble to reply to th*t part of the Coaipany 1 $ letter which deuis with this point fct the isosient. 6. the second point raised by the Co^any, i.e. the possibility of their emphasising the word 'Islands' does not appear difficult and I can see no har© in their in cluding s forasiia similar to tiie one suggested in their letter unacr reference but I would suggest that they speci fically state what is understood by the Bahrain Islands. I They might, for instance, mention 'the unallotted portion of the Isuand of Bahrain and me other Island* constituting the Bahrain group' and in addition I would prefer to see &amp; list of Islands which are s*id by the* and by the bhaikh \ to constitute the Bahrain group so that there esn be no question/-question of any sundial anting w ith regard to ^\ioh ialancia were intendtid* 7. The tiriirc point i&amp; the poll ..iCAl effect of this isove by His Highness the Hui*r of Banr&amp;in, unofficial thou.iii it he, on the ^resent reletlona betneozi Qatar and. Bahrein and. its effect on ast^teisenis which have &amp;1 - ready been au»de to ourcelve* by His Highness the Mier with regard to hist attitude towards the Oil Company -nd their possible operations in the Ilibarah area* On the 5th of M&amp;y 1957 &amp; conference took place between His Highness Simikkx Sir He mad bin »Isa &amp;1 Khelifah, K.C.I.E*, €•£.!*, his brother Shaikh ibdullsh bin his son Shaikh S&amp;im&amp;Xi bln Haacd, the Honourable the political Besident and a^self st which the Mvlser to the Bahrain Government was present and the first and principal point which was discusa^d was the question of His Highness* attitude with regard to the Qatar Oil agreement. His Highness* attitude as stated then is described in my letter D*0*?*a*C/&amp;&amp;4~4/i«5 dated the 5tii May addressed to the iidviser to the 3«?iirain Governsient, a copy of which was sent to you under ay printed letter Ho* T/16-4/13$ dated the BSth May 1^-37. For easy reference I quote fro* paragraph £ of the letter mentioned abovei- n (&amp;) 01s Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain agreed thi't, if his clrlsi to /ubarah was upheld, he had no objection to the Oil Company, who at present held the Qatar let; se, work ing within or below the trea and that iiis Ci&amp;lm to the Zubarah area in no way affect ed the present lease of the tetar Oil Com pany; (b) That he had no objection to the Oil Co spotty constructing a port within the are* of Zu- b&amp;rfch athd he fctat^d that he would be respon sible for the protection of the st.id port. Rtoo •5- &amp;o that His Highness 9 fettitucie wa# that with regard to ub&amp;reh question he was jNNpSMft to waivv any pos- sllxle oil right* that he might have had In that area. If his cXalai was upheld then he /.aiTes hi* rightsi if hiss elfeija was not upheld then naturally the ^oint does not arise. It would now appear, if the inforaction eon- t&amp;ined in th# CoByany 1 2 letter is to te accepted literal* Xy # that his Highness, hawing already assured us that the question of his claim to lubarsh would not affect the Oil Ire&amp;se and that he nad no objection to the development of Oil in the area, is now endeavouring to prevent the eev &gt;* lopaent of the Zubarah area by the inclusion of a clause in the Agreement for the Bahrain unallotted area. This assounta to an allegation that ills Highness is in ml sing in what can only be described as double-dealing. I ay- self do not for one moment believe that it was His High ness 1 intention to go beck on hie statement of the 5th &amp;sy end in ary opinion there has h en ft great deal of ada- understanding. However, misunderstanding or no misunder standing, I consider tnat we should be wrong in any way to acquiesce in such a clause being insert Kl in trie Agrt -ment for the unallotted area, for, in the first piece It might be read to imply that the Xh&amp;ikb of Bahrain h&amp;a territorial rights in the Qatar Peninsula, and secondly, it would have a biab effect on the already strained relations between qatar and Bahrain should it ever corr.« to the knowledge of the Shaikh of Qatar that such a clause had been Included in the Oil Agreement. 8. While discussing this question, I wisn to suggest a possible solution to the problem and at the seme time t kot possible solution to ths Zub&amp;ran problem. The solution 7 /ould/wouJLo be for the hulejs* of Ik hr &amp; In tad the Ruler of C&amp;tar to agree that the !2ubr.rah area be hzlC by the Buler of Bahrain as the personal property of the Shaikhs of Bah- rain, and tnet His Miijesty ? s Goveiunaent should be re quested to agree to Uxis compromise with the proviso ththe mineral rights, i.su oil, etcetera, in tui-t area remain vested in tne Shaikh of Qatar ana that Petra- (Qatar) ieujk Conce*sions/I«iBiiteci who ere the Company operating in the Ctt-^r PenintuXa should have every right of access for the development ana working of Oil that sdght ‘be lo cated in that area* Although the possibility of the two Rulers agreeing in this is by no means certain, I think it not unlikely that some such suggestion will be put for ward in the not very distant future as I have reasons to believe that various influential personages whose interests are proportionately divided between the two States are doing their utmost to bringing about a settlement of the Zubarah question.

POt. DE?T.)o JS&gt; P.Z. 5432/37. ^Cc • r T xA-v^t- Mr. Longrigg telephoned on 15th September. He asked whether P.C.L. could get on with the question of the Unallotted area, and whether they could instruct their local representative to try to reopen the negotiations. They are anxious to go ahead with drilling etc., in Qatar, but while the Unallqtted area is still open, they are reluctant to do so, as discovery of oil in the mainland would cause the Sheikh of Bahrein to stand out for a higher price for the Hawar Islands. As it is, they (P.C.L.) claim that they had got the Unallotted area in the bag when the trouble started over Zubarah. I said that we had referred Mr. Longrigg*s letter of 16th August (P.Z. 5432/37) to the local political authorities for consideration. Our line throughout had been that these negotiations should be local, and not in London. There would be no objection to P.C.L. ! s local authority trying to get the negotiations started again, provided he consulted the Political Agent. If the Political Agent found it necessary he would refer to the Political Resident, and if necessary the Political Resident to us. Our position in the matter of the wording of the concession had been explained to Mr. Longrigg in our letter of the 28th August. Mr. Longrigg asked what sort of Political Agreement, if any, would be required for the Unallotted area concessionaire. I said that I could not remember offhand what sort of Political Agreement we had had in mind. In reply to a question from him I assured him that there was no question of differentiating between the two competing/competing companies and that whichever company got the concession would have to submit to political conditions. I do not propose to say any more to Mr. Longrigg on this point unless he reverts to it. I think it would be best, if possible, to wait until the Sheikh has decided which Company to give the area to before considering the question of the detailed political conditions to be attached. If P. C.L. get it, I should think a Political Agreement on the usual lines (Debai etc.) would be suitable. If, however, the B.P.C. get it, there are difficult questions such as that discussed at the meeting on the 9th July 1936 (see minutes below P.Z. 5448/36) - e.g. it might be undesirable to suggest a pre-emption clause.

Skliros PC. 26/452 CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON l6th August 1937• ft Dear Mr. Walton, As you know, we were desirous some months ago of obtaining a concession for the unallotted portion of the Bahrain Group of islands. We appeared to be on the point of obtaining this when the Shaikh requested a post ponement of negotiations for twelve months, owing to the difference which had arisen between him and the Shaikh of Qatar regarding Zubarah. • E.C.2 Inf ormati on now reaches from Bahrain to the effect that the Shaikh would.- in,.ajl probability be willing to give us all the unallotted territory, on terras already substantially agreed between him and Major Holmes, acting on our behalf, provided that a clause be inserted in the concession agreement that n no effort would be made to develop the oil resources of the Zubarah area'. Zubarah is, of course, on the mainland of Qatar and therefore included in our Qatar concession. As have ratified that concession (with its description of the area covered, and its map attached) we assume your view to be that Zubarah is part of the territory already granted us by the Shaikh of Qatar. Thus if we give the undertaking now asked for by the Shaikh of Bahrain we should appear to be asking for the same territory twice over, and also, .by implication, admitting the. B Jirain claim to Zubarah, which would be hotly’’Tesehted by the .Shaikh of Qatar.//^ - 2 - At the same time we remain anxious to obtain the unallotted portion of the Bahrain Islands, and we feel that a formula for these could perhaps be found which would leave the Zubarah question completely on one side. Might this be done, for instance, by emphasising the word ^Islands”, that is, by asking for 'the unallotted portion of Bahrain Island and all the other Islands under the Sovereignty of the Shaikh of Bahrain?” Do you think that the Political Resident would be able to advise the Shaikh that a concession in these terms would do nothing to deprive him of any claims to Zubarah (on the mainland) which he might ultimately be able to substantiate? We feel at the moment some difficulty about proceeding further with active operations on Qatar until we have obtained rights over the Bahrain group since the latter in clude the Hawar Islands; if, for example, investigations proved Qatar to be valuable, this would be likely to create intensive competition for the Hawar Group. Yours sincerely. J.C. Walton Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.P.Z. 4975/37. Minute Paper. '!) ^ (Ti^L //3 political Department. The previous submission is at P.Z.3824/37. Although the Sheikh of Bahrein had decided to postpone for a year negotiations with the oil companies for the unallotted area of Bahrein it was considered advisable, in the meanwhile, to clear up the point raised by the Political Agent, Bahrein, in his letter of May 15 addressed to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (P.Z.4384/37). Major Holmes of Petroleum Concessions Limited had proposed an additional clause to Article 1 of the draft lease, as follows:- 'but if, during the C currency of this Agreement, territorial limits of the A Sheikhdom of Bahrein should be extended, then the Sheikh agrees that the area covered by this concession agreement will be co-termin^s with such extended territorial Vtu* Mr*** limits'. It £e considered that although it improbable that the territories of the Sheikh of Bahrein be extended, yet if such extension did take place, difficulties might arise as the additional area might lie within lOM* territory already leased with the approval of H.M.G. to another company. The Political Agent, Bahrein, thought^ therefore^ that Petroleum Concessions Limited should be informed that the additional clause could not be approved / and negotiations should be confined to the actual area at present considered to belong to His Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Political Resident supported this view. Y/e wrote to the /k ffco he r u^ Foreign Office on July 15 and they have now replied that they agree that the proposed additional clause is unacceptable. A draft to the Political Resident is, therefore, submitted. 5S53 5000 3/37(3) P. Z. 4975/37 11 14 - Draft Paper. political Department.

Major Holmes pressed for the inclusion of Um-His&amp;n in the concession area if necess ary with well-defined and limited rights as regards drilling or other operations. A form of compromise was di8cussed v viz*- that the island should be included in the concession area with the reservation that no work should take place without the specific approval of the Ruler. It was brought to notice that it was desirable to provide against the contingency that the Ruler or his successors might change their point of view regarding Um Nisan in which case the Company holding the concession would have no protection against possible opposing interests unless some such ccrapromise was included in the agreement. Mr. Belgrave agreed to raise the question of Urn Hiaan again with H.H. the Ruler with a view to obtaining either limited rights to drill (which Mr.Belgrave thought unlikely) or at least protection for the Company getting the concession against future complications (described above). Mr .Belgrave accepted all the other minor amendments and additions of the latest draft. He however consider ed that it would be advisable in all the circumstances at present to reduce the minimum of 2000 Tons in the clause dealing with oil in commercial quantities. Major Holmes agreed to cable London suggesting a minimum of 650 Tons per day for 30 consecutive days. 4. /4 r-\ -3- 5. 6 . Mr. Belgrave raieed the question of the Company’s comiitments in the event of the Company being desirous of gild ng up the concession during the first 6 years. Major Holmes shewed him that this was provided for in terms which should be satisfactory to the Ruler in the Concession agreement and Mr .Belgrave agreed. In reply to a question by Major Holmes Mr.Belgrave stated that he considered that he would need about a week (not longer) to consult H.H. the Ruler and c et his decisions. :*[aJior Holmes intimated that he expected to return to Sharjah (and Dubai) on May 2nd.

Mr. Belgrade agreed to reopen the subject with the Sheikh. Mr. Belgrave did so yesterday uiorning. Sheikhs Abdullah and Sul&amp;iman were also present with His High ness. Neither Hi.

They wished Mr.Belgrave to point out that exactly the same message was given to each Company so neither Company should feel that any particular discrimination was made in its case.

These matters are being developed with my principals. The Adviser raised the question as tb the meaning of 'commercial quantities' and it was pointed out that so many factors enter into the determination of this that anything mare definite cannot be stipulated; it is a term customarily used in Oil Concession Agreements.

The offer which I made during my second discussion with the Adviser, and which is aet forth in my letter No.PA- 156 of April 2nd to you, was amplified and extended during this morning’s discussion so that the offer now embraces the following points: that, if His Highness She ikh Sir Hamad bin Issa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., will grant to The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited an oil concession covering the Additional Area, that is to say all of the territory under the dominion of His Highness (including territorial waters), other than that which has been selected by my Company under the terms of the present Mining Lease, such concession to be under the terms and conditions of the present Mining Lease except as to the following obligations which my Company is prepared to undertake with respect to the Additional Area: 1. My Company will pursue, with diligence and without unnecessary delay, geological work including structure drilling and geopi^ysical work if necessary; 2. If a favourable area is found my Company will drill a test well and if sufficient oil should be discovered to Justify my Company in drilling further wells, such drilling will be continued until oil in commercial qi antities has been obtained, or until the area is no longer deemed a favourable one. 3. My Company will pay His Highness Rs. 100,000 upon the granting of such concession and a further sum of Rs. 300,000 upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. In view of ,our previous discussion abo^t the meaning of the term M commercial quantities' I suggested, for the further assurance of His Highness, that Company would be prepared to accept a provi sion stating in effect that as soon as a well, or /- 2 - m I2&gt;6 or wells, had been drilled capable of producing, in accordance with good oil field practice, a daily average of a fixed amount, say 500 tons, of oil, it would be deemed that oil has been found in commercial quantities. 4. Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities m Company will continue drilling with at least one string of tools until a sufticient number of wells iiave been drilled within the pro iuct ive area to meet the requirements of good oil field practice, it being understood, however, that this obligation may be suspended during such time as the wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average production of at least 1000 tons of oil; 5. Commencing with the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities the royalties received by His Highness shall not be less than at the rate of Rs•50,000 each year. The above offer relates to all of the Additional Area, but in view of His Highness’s insistence upon reserving the use of the Island of Umm al Hass am it is 'understood that the Company may not drill upon that island without first obtain ing the consent of His Highness. The form of the concession, of course, will be subject to the approval of the parties concerned. Yours very truly, sd. E.A. 3kinner R esid ent Manager THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.

My dear Fowle, With reference to your telegram No.198 of the 12th February and connected correspondence, you may care to know that Lewisohn of Petroleum Concessions Limited dropped a remark to me the other day to the effect that the Company had now decided not to press for the additional area on the main Bahrein Islands, but to confine themselves to endeavouring to secure the territorial waters (presumably including the small 'territorial islands') and the Hawar group. I gathered that they were instructing their local people accordingly. I am sending a copy of this letter to Loch. Yours sincerely, (SgdL) M. J. CLAUSON The Hon T ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W.

R. Ballantyne o ehalf of the company. During most of that period His Excellency tos in england and the negotiations were carried on, of course, with 7 ^noT^ 86 8 0 °r ent ° f th6 Shalkl1 and Hls toJccty'® Government. ELl«r,r agreement was reached before Mr. Belgrave's departure from -ngland, it was understood that negotiations were to be continued here and a f 1 have mentioned to you in several interviews during the past few months, my Company are desirous of resuming such negotiations, Th ® position of my Company in this matter has been explained fully to His excellency the Shaikh through his Advisers. My Caroany believe that for many reasons they are entitled to preferentialtreat- h«f 1 .H reSPe f^ f 7 he Wh ° le ° f the Additional Area. His Excellency ment a?“^ ed K th entitled to this preferential treat- ment. At the beginning of the negotiations in London last summer, he assured the ocmpany that he wishes them to have the rest of his ter- ntory to deal with. . , ., * need not reni ind His Excellency that when others declined to ^ 5 P r ° s P ect ing for oil here in Bahrein, my Conroany accented that risk and have been successful in developing oil in commercial quan tities, with the result that today Bahrein is again enjoying prosperity. The oomnany have fulfilled all of their obligations and have incurred a heavy investment in their developments here - developments carried on au a much more rapid pace than required by the Company’s obligations un er the present concession. These developments include not only com plete facilities of a producing oil field but a modern refinery now in he course of completion, the opening of a seaway to within three miles oi bitra, and the installation of five submarine loading lines.(COPY) B» M* T s P* A* - 2 March 4, 1937. May I also remind His Excellency that in addition to ful filling loyally all of their obligations, my Company as far back as 1933, in deference to the wishes of His Excellency and his Advisers, suspended their then existing application for a concession over the Additional Area, a step which lost the Company the services of a valuable adviser on local affairs. My Company are reluctant to believe that the Shaikh wishes to disregard his previous recognition of the preferential treatment to which the Company are entitled. Nevertheless, if the Company must con tinue to bargain for the Additional Area, they are prepared to do so, and should this be necessary the Company believe they are justified in assuming that, at the very least, they will be afforded equal oppor tunities, with respect to any competitors, as to the manner and extent of such bargaining. In other words, my Company, having already done so much for Bahrein, should have an opportunity of fair bargaining with any others who may appear interested in acquiring the Additional Area. The Company cannot believe that they are faced with the juxtaposition of a rival concern who would appear to have no claim whatever to be considered in preference to the Company. I am sending you this letter in triplicate in order to facilitate your bringing it to the notice of the Shaikh and his Advisers. My Company would appreciate it very much if you would arrange to do this as soon as possible so that negotiations may be resumed without further delay, and I hope, with successful results. I am also sending two copies of this letter to Mr. Ballantyne in London. Yours very truly. E. A. Skinner (Signed) E. A. SKINNER Resident Manager THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDV r' 1 jas/m.

He seems, on the contrary, to favour the idea of giving us the Hawar group, and possibly one or two other islands, but not the unallotted part of Bahrain, nor the larger islands near its coast. The Company considers that it has, from more than one point of viev;, a high claim to be allotted the areas for which it has applied, and feels that the allotment of a further area to the Standard Oil Company of California w r ould have a definitely adverse effect upon our prospects of successful negotiation on the Trucial Coast. We have, therefore, told Belgrave that we remain candidates for the whole area for which we have applied and for which we have made a very generous offer, and we are not disposed to be interested in anything less. We should, meanwhile, view with some regret the allotment of any further area to the Californians, who had not, we believe, made any step towards asking for it until we entered the field — and who have, to /o- .

(You knov; he is always rather vague). (a) That Mr.Skliros (P.C.L.) appeared to he of the opinion that the HA7AR ISLANDS by themselves would not be good enough, without the addition of the mainland territory. (b) That Mr.Skliros also thought, and Major Holmes rather concurred, that if the Bahrein Petroleum Company got any additional areas in Bahrein territory, before the Petroleum Concessions Limited had managed to fix their options and concessions, (particularly the options), on the Trucial Coast, this would encourage the Trucial Coast Sheikhs to intrigue with the Bahrein Petroleum Company with the object of giving options, etc. to them rather than to ttee^aalTTeMeu.pptrolPum Cofftpeasy. (c) That he - (Major Holmes) had received information from the Petroleum Concessions Limited’s representative in Debai that soon after he - (Major Holmes) had left the Trucial Coast, an Arab on behalf of the Bahrein Petroleum Company had arrived at Debai and approached the Sheikh. The latter had replied that he had made arrangements with Major Holmes, and would not go back on them. (d) That Mr.Skliros hoped that there would not be too great a hurry over demarcating the boundaries of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms, as this might complicate matters as between the Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Sheikhs. 2* With regard to (a). Nothing can be done until Mr.Belgrave on return to Bahrein finds out from the Sheikh exactly what plan the latter has in mind. With/2 7/ith regard to (~b). I do not think that there is much in this, 'but will discuss with Colonel Loch and let you have my views. Vith regard to (c). If' this is true that the Bahrein Petroleum Company have 'been playing rather low down, 1 will endeavour to confirm in Bahrein, and report. V/ith regard to (d). This fits in with our views* 3.

Dalrymple Whitehall S.W. 1 THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED, 11, BIRCHIN LANE, LONDON, E.G. 3. 5th October 1936. Dear Belgrave, I have communicated to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited the gist of our talk on Friday last. Whilst the Sheikh has not, apparently, expressed himself in clear and unequivocal terms as to the territory concerned, he would appear to contemplate-' ceding to the Petroleum Concessions Limited and without reference to this Company, a lease of the Hawar Islands and ad joining Mainland territory, claimed by the Sheikh as coming within his domain, leaving whatever balance of territory there might be, for this Company later on to compete for against whosoever might care to interest himself in it. Assuming that the foregoing is, generally speaking, correct, I am asked by the Company to recall to the Sheikh and his Advisers that throaghout the earlier negotiations conducted by Major Frank Holmes and recently through me, all parties have had in mind as the so-called additional area, the balance of the territory (including territorial waters) coming within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh, that is after deducting the land and rights conceded to the Company uncier and through the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1985. it was on this understanding the Company tendered through me its offer of Rs.400,000 as a premium for a concession of the additional area in July last. My recollection is that this was also your understanding. I have since confirmed to you orally that this offer of a premium was made unconditionally and Belgrave Esq., C.B.E., did/ Court,i Correct * ? To mj; knowledge no such assurances have been given, this presumably refers to some conversation in Bahrain. \L% did not depend in any way upon proof that the Hawar Islands contain oil-bearing possibilities. Such a confirmation was made possible by the visit to those Islands by one of the Company’s Geologists, a visit which was made with your sanction. ? The Company have never expressed themselves as being interested in acquiring a concession of a portion of the additional area belonging to the Sheikh. In f act, it has been always emphasised that the Company desired.to. acquire the whole of the additional area, a desire they still retain. It is here that the Company feel the Sheikh is under a misapprehension. His Excellency might also be under the impression that the Company would not wish to develop the additional area as well and as quickly as another competing Company might do. This is not the case because the Company are prepared to give careful consideration to the desires of the Sheikh as well in this as in other respects. I think you will agree with me that the performance by the Company to date in exploring and developing the territory held by them under their existing Concession is sufficient proof of their ability and initiative in developing an oil field. The Company also believe they are supported in their feeling that there exists a misunderstanding in the minds of the Sheikh and his Advisers by the recent assurances given since July last by the Sheikh to the Company, that he wishes the Company to have the rest of his territory to deal with - that is, the additional area. May I now venture to x^emind you that when the Company first came on the scene they did so in the face of the belief held by some Experts, that the possibilities of oil/&amp; the Coy.are getting oil. Major Prank Holmes. No such Agreement was made. oil being found within the Sheikh’s territories were negligible. However, using the vast experience at their command and sparing neither time nor money, the Company went ahead to prove their own conviction, with the result that today Bahrein is once again enjoying prosperity. The Company have loyally fulfilled all their obligations to the Sheikh and this without any friction with any of the Sheikh’s Subjects or Advisers. In 1933 the Company, in deference to the wishes of the Sheikh and his Advisers, suspended their then existing application for a concession over the remainder of the Sheikh’s territory, a step v/hich has lost them the services of their sole adviser on local affairs. The Company have opened up a sea-way to within three miles of Sitrah and are now constructing a Refinery which cannot but add to the security, wealth and importance of the Sheikh’s domain. Furthermore, the Company are reluctant to believe that the Sheikh wishes to dis regard the Agreement which you on his behalf and I on behalf of the Company came to in July last for the preferential treatment of this Company. That Agreement, I would recall to you, was that the Company should have the preferential right to the whole of the additional area for Rs.400,000 subject only to the terms and conditions of the Agreement being settled by the Sheikh’s Advisers. However, if the Company must continue to bargain for the additional area they are prepared to do so. In other words, the Company would ask that having already done so much for Bahrein, they may have an opportunity of fair bargaining with any others who may appear interested in acquiring the additional area, or a portion of it. The Company/no 4. Company cannot 'believe that they are faced with the juxtaposition of a rival concern who would appear to have no claim whatever to he considered in preference to the We informed the Coy.that another Coy. had come into the field. We then gave them a time limit in which to say whether they were interested or not, at the very end of this time they sat up &amp; took notice. (Intld. )C.D.B. Company* I send you this letter in triplicate in order to facilitate your bringing it to the immediate notice of the Sheikh and his Advisers. At the same time I am sending a copy of it to the Company in Bahrein in order that they may know the position there with the least possible delay, and so be prepared to carry on and, I hope, successfully conclude there, the negotiations for the additional area if it is found to be impossible to complete them here* Yours, &amp;c..

The question ox the Bahrein Additional Area / ' was discussed in Mr. Walton's room at the India Office with Colonel Fov/le and Mr. Belgrave on the 1st October, with particular reference to Mr. Belgrave's letter to Mr. Clauson dated the 23rd September. Mr. Belgrave was asked by Mr. Walton whether he was clear what, precisely, the Sheikh had in mind when he referred to 'Hawar and other connected islands'. Mr. Belgrave said he was not sure; His Excellency might mean merely the Hawar group or he might mean the Hawar group plus the small inlands in the immediate vicinity of the two main Bdarein Islands. It was agreed that in view of the obscurity regarding the Sheikh’s intentions it would not be possible for Mr. Belgrave to carry his negotiations with the oil companies to any conclusion pending his return to Bahrein and discussion with the Sheikh. It was haw ever agreed that it would be useful if Mr. Belgrave were to ascertain informally and without prejudice from Mr. Longrigg whether Petroleum Concessions Limited would be interested in a proposition whereby they would receive, not the whole additional area, but either (a) the Hawar Islands only or (b) the Hawar Islands plus the 'territorial' islands in the immediate vicinity of the two Main Islands and what they would offer for either (a) or (b). Mr. l^ilton mentioned to2 &lt;m i% Mr, Belgrave that the India Office had gathered from Mr. Longrigg that he thought it doubtful whether Petroleum Concessions Limited would consider (a) alone, but that they might consider proposition (b). As regards the two mam islands, it was agreed chat it might be useful for Mr. Belgrave to ascertain (again informally and without prejudice) from Mr. Ballantyne whether the Bahrein Petroleum Company would stand by their offer (of 4 lakhs) if the area to be given ro them were to be only unallotted area in the two main iolanus, or what they would offer cither for this area or for this p lu s the 'territorial' islands. it was pointed out that when they made their offer originally the Bahrein Petroleum Company were unaware of the fact that the Hawar Islands were anything to do with Bahrein (though of course their offer ?/as presumably intended uo cover Ghe territorial waters and the islands therein). It..was agreed that it would considerably facilitate Mr. Belgrave*s discussion of the whole question with the Sheikh if he were in possession of information on the above points. The question of the allocation of territorial waters was also discussed. Assuming that the Sheikh kept to his idea of splitting the Area in two, and assuming that proposition (b) were adopted, it was s'ug&gt;&amp; es 'md that the best thing to do might be to draw lines round the small 'territorial islands' so as to divide equally the territorial waters between them and the main islands. INDIA OFFICE. 5th October, 1936.Colonel Fowle . ^ ^ Mr. Wgdton, //hen ivlr. Longrigg was here yesterday afternoon I mentioned to him that the Sheikh had in mind the possibility oi splitting the additional area in two and negotiating with P.C.L. for the Hawar Islands. 1 said that we thought the Sheikh had in mind giving the rest of the additional area other than the Hawar Islands to the Americans. 1 asked whether the Hawar Islands would be a commercial proposition by themselves from the Company's point of view. He said that he thought that it was very doubtful whether the Company would consider the Hawar Islands merely by themselves. They might do so in conjunction with the other small islands Bahrein. if it was a question of dividing [d the additional area into the remaining area of the ' ju mainland on one side and the rest of the whole additional area on the other side it might be a possible proposition. He said that in any case the Company were not tremendously interested in the whole thing and there would be no question of them paying enormous sums for the privilege of obtaining this concession.It looks rather as if we had better discuss with Mr. Belgrave the possibility of dividing the area into (a) the mainland, and (b) all the islands. That leaves the territorial waters to be considered. It might be best to reserve these waters entirely. Shall we discuss?23rd. September 1936# Dear Clausen, Lewes Crescent.

The whole question is largely a gamble, dependent on whether the oil indications are favourable or not. Considering the offers made by the two Companies separately; (l) Under the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s proposal the Company want the right to examine the territory for 3 months before committing themselves, but if having paid a purely nominal sum in order to secure an opportunity oi carrying out preliminary ^ aV* investigations they decide to turn down the proposition, the Ivt^^lraq Petroleum Company may lose interest and the Sheikh would tafesr ..

If the Gompany decide to proceed and take up a lease they pay down a lump sum of Us.400,000, but the territory would then be merged with their existing area and the only payments which the Sheikh would receive would be in respect of royalty on any oil produced. It might, in fact, turn out that they would decide to hold the additional territory in reserve and not develop it to any appreciable extent for a considerable time. (S) Under the Petroleima Concessions Limited proposal the &amp; Company offer to pay Rs.50,000 on signature of the agreement and they must also pay Rs.156,000 during the option period of six years. If they terminate the agreement within this period they still have to pay any balance outstanding of the full amount specified. (See Articles 4 and 5 of the draft agreement.) They might, of course, abandon the concession at the end of the option period after making a total payment of only Rs.206,000. On the other hand, if oil were found and the Company decided to take out a lease they would have to continue with further minimum annual payments of Rs.50,000 p.a. for the first 5 years of the lease and Rs.100,000 p.a. subsequently. There would, therefore, be some inducement to them to continue with the development of the area and the Sheikh would be assured(M \% of the receipt of regular minimum annual payments, which, after a period, of 10 years, would overtake the original lump sum offered by the Bahrein Petroleum Company .

Sir, With reference to my confidential despatch of the 13th of September and previous correspondence relating to the grant of marine concessions in the coastal waters adjoining the oil bearing areas of this •'olony, I have the honour to inform you that it has been reported to me that undersea oil boring operations have been successfully undertaken at Pedemales on the Pedemales branch of the Orinico river in the Territorio Delta Amacuro region of Venezuela, roughly to the west* south-west of Icacos Point, which is the extreme south* west point of Trinidad. In consequence, interest has been aroused in the question of the possibility of submarine oil boring within the ten fathoms area adjoining the sea board of this Colony. I transmit herewith a map compiled from the official chart of the Hydrographic office of the Uavy Department, United states of America, on which has been indicated by a green line the territorial waters of Trinidad and Venezuela, i.e. the area of water within a distance of a marine league from the coast and islands belonging to this Colony and to Venezuela. An examination of this nmo will show that considerable areas within the 10 The Right Honourable J.H.Thomas, &amp;.P., &amp;C , &amp;c. &amp;c. fathom Colonial Office.HCT- fathom limit ♦ which are deemed by experts to be capable of exploitation for oil boring purposes, lie beyond the territorial waters of both Trinidad and Veneauela. Important local interests are concerned, and the Managers of certain Trinidad oil producing companies haye made enquiries from me regarding the position which would arise if a non-British Oil Producing Company were to attempt to exploit oil in the 10 fathom area beyond the territorial waters of the Colony, 3. 1 am advised that in the present circumstances this Government has no power to interfere in such operations, and I have been requested to bring the matter to your notice with a view to an endeavour being made to secure by diplomatic agreement with the Government or the Governments of such countries as may be interested the control over these are ts. This matter of course concerns the United States of Venezuela, but it may also be of interest to the United States of America, 4. The area which is of particular concern to this Colony is the on© coloured blue on the map to the north and north-west of the green line marking the limit of the territorial waters of the Colony within the Gulf of Pari a, and south of latitude IQ 0 !© 1 , This ia not very distant from the area Pedemalea in which the Standard Oil Company of Venezuela, an associated or subsidiary Company of the Standard Oil Company of Kew York, is now operating, 5. I venture to suggest that a basis for negotiation might be found by dividing between Venezuela and this Colony the control of the submarine areas of the Gulf of Faria as indicated by the red line on the map from the point A, latitude lu^sa’lS' North, longitude 61 a 54♦50 , * West, toMOI (Intld^ A.C.H to the point B, latitude 10 o 02*30 rt Korth, longitude 62 Q Q$' West, and again by the red line lying to the south of the Island of Trinidad along the parallel of latitude 9°57»3o' north running west of longitude dl^O’ West, point X to point Y, where the latter Intersects the limit of the territorial waters of Venezuela in approximately longitude 61°56*45* West, The first mentioned line has been selected in order to avoid bringing the question of the sovereign rights to the Island of Patos into discussion, 6. An important fact in connection with the situation set forth above is that access to the Gulf of Pari a is for practical purposes controlled by the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela, since the territorial waters of the two Governments overlap both in the Dragon’s Mouths and in the Serpents Mouth. 7, X may add that I have already received several applications for oil exploration licences within the territorial waters of the Colony, and I should be grateful for a reply at your early convenience to my confidential despatch of the 8th July, 1935.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Men to refer to your letter .3e. 15043/3B/35 of the 30th January last, in which his observations were solicited as to the possibility and desirability of concluding an agreement with Venezuela for the control of the submarine oil-bearing areas of the Culf of Pari between Trinidad and Venezuela. 2. It has been suggested semi-officially by the Colonial Office that there are three broad methods whereby ouch an agreement might be concluded;- (a) It might be possible to come to an arrangement with Venezuela whereby that country and the Colony collaborated in levying at the entrances to the Gulf prohibitive dues on crude oil won subaqueouslyj (b) The entire waters of the Gulf might be divided as national waters by agreement between Trinidad and Venezuela. (c) The sea bed might be divided as national territory without changing the present territorial position as regard]! the waters of the Gulf. 3. The proposal to levy dues at the entrances of the Gulf hinges on the fact that the openings at either end of the (Julf are of such &amp; width as to consist wholly of British or Venezuelan territorial waters. It is not, however, possible under international law to levy dues on vessels passing through territorial waters (and a fortiori on vessels passing through S2SX Ko.A.878/878/47 The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office. straitsstrait# which ar« international highways) merely on account of their passage. In this connexion, reference is invited to Draft Article 7 of the Report of the Territorial laters Committee of the Hague Codification Conference (League Decrement C.230.LM17 1930 V, page 8). It is equally impossible to levy dues on vessels merely because they carry through territorial waters a substance which they have taken from the open sea* 4. Were it found possible to adopt the second proposal and to divide the waters of the Culf as national waters by agreement between the Colony end Venezuela, the subsoil beneath the Gulf would then automatically become the property of the two territorial States. Authority for this general view can be found in Draft Article 2 of the Report of the Codification Committee already referred to. In the present case, however, certain difficulties arise. In the first place, the Gulf of Paria, even assuming that it can properly be regarded as coming within the category of a Gulf or bay, is not a gulf or bay enclosed within the territory of a single State. The ordinary rule of international law governing territorial waters in gulfs or bays is that such waters only become national waters if entirely enclosed by the territory of one State* The rule is thus stated on page 11 of the Codification Committee’s Report. In cases such as the present, however, where there are two riparian States, it is arguable that these can , by making an agreement between themselves, jointly appropriate as national waters just as much as would be appropriable if all the coasts belonged to one State* On this point reference is invited to the proposal of the Delegation of the tlnited States of America quoted on pa 'e 12 of the Codification Committee’s report. It is understood that such a course lias, in fact, been taken with regard to morestore than one bay in the American continent* 5* In the present case, however, it hardly seems that -v the ease can properly be regarded as coming under gulfs and bays. The gulf of F&amp;ria must probably be regarded as a highway between two portions of the open sea, being, in fact, used considerably as a highway for traffic. In these circumstances, it falls from the point of view of the rules governing territorial waters not so much under the rules with regard to bays and gulfs, but under those conceining straits. In this conruixion* reference may be made to page 13 of the Codification Oonaaittee 1 s report. Having regard to the observations there made, it would seem impossible effectively to make the Gulf of Faria into national waters by any agreement with Venezuela. There would, of course, be nothing to prevent the Colony entering into an agreement with .. 5 e „ by which vetv/een tlrenaelvea the two countries would divide up the water, of the Sulf. If this agreement met. with no objection or challenge on the part of other countries, it might in time be possible to establish a valid claim internationally on the grounds of prescription. On the otaer hand, there would be nothing to prevent other countries from maintaining that such an agreement was only operative as between the two parties to it and ti at they for their part could not regard it as excluding them in any way from such portions of the Gulf as consisted in their opinion of high seas. It is, moreover, to be expected that as soon m it ■ceame known that the object of the agreement was to exploit oil beneath the surface of the ocean otter countries would speedily take up this attitude and they would certainly quote His ajesty*s Government*a action when replying to protests by His Majesty’s Government against the attempted appropriationsZO € appropriations of other States. 6. The third suggestion is that Trinidad and Venezuela should appropriate the oil-be&amp;ring areas of the sea bed of the Gulf outside territorial waters where the sea is not more than ten fathoms deep. The generally recognised riew of international law with regard to the bed of the open sea and the subsoil beneath it is that the sea bed and the subsoil is res nullius » but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. The beet statement of the position in this! connexion vill be found in the article by Sir Cecil Burst in the 1923 number of the British /ear Book of International Law, under the title 'Whose is the bed of the ilea?*. The question haa also been discussed in connexion with the scheme for a Channel tunnel between France and the United Kingdom, and reference is invited to Section 5 (“Limits of rationality and of Jurisdiction'*) in the reooid of the proceedings of the Channel Tunnel Commission of 1S75. The question is also discussed in Oppenheim: International Law, Volume I, 4th Edition, pages 513-51?. 7. In view of the opinions expressed by these authorities it would seer.; quite possible from the point of view of inter national law for Trinidad and Venezuela to divide up the sea bed of the Gulf of Paria as national territory between than. It must be considered, however, what action should be taken in order to substantiate the acquisition by occupation. Presumably, the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela would come to m underst&amp;nding that both would proceed in the same way and that neither would occupy beyond an agreed median line. The Government of Trinidad might then pass legislation appropriating to the Government the portions of the bed of the sea falling to the Colony*8 share and at the same time take certain physical steps as evidence of their appropriation. The/ might7.0 ^ might, for cxikraplc, «r«ct posts op buoys over those portions of the bod of the open sea which they hare appropriated* on the other hand, it would soaroely be sufficient for the Colonial Government to adopt a purely dog-in-the-manger policy* They should at least make some attempt to work the oil, sit er themselves or through licences* 8* I am to return herewith, as requested, the map of the Gulf of Paria which formed an enclosure to your letter under reference. &lt;■ 9, Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, Petroleum Department and Dominions office * I am, etc. (Signed) J*M. Troutbeek.«. 395/36 Admiralty, ZlO 9til April, 1936. Sir, I am commanded by My Lords Comraisaioners of the Admiralty to refer to your letter No. 15043/3B/35 of the 30th January, enclosing a copy of a deepatch from the Governor of Trinidad relating to the development of submarine oil-boring areas adjacent to the seaboard of tiat colony. 2. iry I.ords underst snd that in commercial circles the opinion is held that valuable petroleum deposits exist beneath the waters of the Gulf of Paria adjacent to Trinidad. The existing oilfields on the island are not inexhaustible, and as time goes on the potential value of any deposits in the Gulf of Paria is likely to become increasingly important. The petroleum industry of the island is coraparatively small, yet it is easily the most valuable source of supply on British territory, and it provides a large percentage of the fuel oil requirements of the British Navy. 3* My Lords therefore feel that there are strong reasons for desiring that the exclusive right of exploitation should be reserved to British interests over the largest possible area of the sea adjacent to the coast of Trinidad. 4* On the other hand &amp;y Lords feel that it is equally important that no steps should be taken by way of appropriation of these waters which would conflict with the doctrines which have hitherto been maintained by K.M*Government in connection with the delimitation of national arid territorial waters* It is of great importance, both from the Naval standpoint and from the point of view of British shipping and fishery interests that The ltader-3ecretary of State, Colonial office, S.W.l.Zll that forei gn powers should not be given a precedent which would enable them to substantiate claims to jurisdiction beyond the limits of national md territorial waters now admitted by Government. 5. Their Lordships agree generally with the view expressed in Foreign Office letter Fo.A.878/878/47 of the 17th : arch to the effect that it is impossible f consistently with the doctrines of international law which have been held for many years past by w, 5. Government, either to appropriate any portion of the waters of the Gulf of Pari a outside existing territorial waters, or to impose a customs barrier at the entrances to the Gulf. In this connection I am to draw attention to correspondence regarding the extent of territorial waters in the Gulf of Paria ending with Admiralty letter of the 9th Fay 1933, in reply to Colonial Office letter Ho. 95841/32 of the 10th April of that year. 6. As regards the third suggestion discussed in the Foreign Office letter under reference, i.e., that the sea bed of the Gulf might be divided between Trinidad and Venezuela as national territory without changing the present territorial position as affecting the waters of the Gulf, 1 am to transmit herewith a copy of a memorandum which has been prepared in the Admiralty dealing with this aspect of the question. The tentative conclusions suggested in this memorandum are broadly that there would be legal justification for such a course, but that great care will be necessary in applying such a policy in order to ensure that it did not involve an incidental extension of territorial waters (due to the creation of ^artificial islands' for the purpose of wording the oil), or an improper interference with the existing rights of free navigation in the Gulf. As regards this last-mentioned aspect of tie question Their Lordships consider that, provided ample not/cenotice ia given of the erection of structures for the purpose of borin (5 arid that they are marked sufficiently, there ia no reason why navigation should be^effectad. 7. My Lords understand that hitherto oil boring operations in the sea bed have only been undertaken off the coast of California, off Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caspian. Sea stnd off the shores of Lake Maracaibo (Venezuela). The possibility of oil existing in the shallow waters surrounding Bahrein in the Persian Gulf has, however, been mentioned in correspondence in connection with delimitati oi the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s concession on that island, and it sudi deposits exist they might be of considerable importance from the Naval point of view, owing to the geographical position of the island and to the fact that it is virtually equivalent to British territory. I am therefore to suggest that a copy of this correspondence might be sent to the India office. 8. The map enclosed with your letter under reply is returned herewith. 9. .opies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Oiaiee, petroleum Department find the Dominions Office. I am, etc. (Signed) S. H. phi Hips.that BORING FOR OIL OW THE HIGH SEAS. How that tecmical proeeyaea have 'b*&amp;m developed which — permit boring for oil in depths of water ranging up to 10 fathoms, it will clearly be impossible to prevent the commercial exploita tion of submarine oil fields, such as that which is suspected to exist in the Oulf of Faria. oreover, it is not to the interest either of the British Smpire or of the Admiralty that such exploitation should be discouraged, because any attempts on the part of the British Government would not be effective to deter foreign interests, and would only lead to British enterprise being outdistanced by our foreign rivals in the development of the new technique* The danger to British interests to be apprehended from this process is that large portions of what is now recognised as high sea may be appropriated by national governments, unce a valuable commercial asset has been proved to lie beneath t ie bed of the sea, the tendency of governments to assume sovereignty is irrestible, both because the assertion of sovereignty is the simplest method of excluding others, and also because a certain revenue from royalties is to be anticipated. The problem therefore is how to ensure that this probate, il not inevitable, extension of state sovereignty takes place without a corresponding increase of territorial or national waters; and the object of this memorandum is to suggest that tmt there is already in international law tne nucleus of a doctrine which would justify the appropriation of ithe bed of the sea, or the sub-aoil thereunder, without appropriation of the water. The tendency of most powers would undoubtedly be to avoid comulications by applying the existing doctrine of territorial waters to the areas of high sea where oil was believed to exist and where they coulo claim a special interest. Clearly therefore it is importantt 'at the legal justification for any policy which would involve the appropriation of less extensive rights should be examined, with a view to determining whether it is possible to set a better precedent. •he view generally taken by International lawyers seems to be that the sub-soil under the bed of the open sea can be acquired on the part of a littoral state through occupation, by the process of boring a tunnel or mine from beneath the soil throuj the sub-soil of the maritime belt into the sub-eoil of the open sec Presumably, on the same reasoning, the boring could start from a point just in aide the maritime belt* 0ppenheim assumes that such occupation can be extended right up to the boundary line of the eub-soil of the maritime belt of another state, but this seams more doubtful. Artificial • accretion, which is somewhat analogous , is (Oppenh*lm, page 458) subject to no state being allowed to alter the natural condition of its own territory to the disadvantage of the natural condition of a neighbouring state's territory, and a tunnel going right up to the boundary of such territory might well be objectionable to tne latter. it would be more reasonable that the tunnelling should not go beyond the midway line between the two countries without the second country agreeing. The occupation must not be, according to Oppenheim, for a purpose which would endanger the freedom of the open sea, nor can anything be dene in the sub-soil to endanger such freedom indirectly. This is all very vague - presumably he has right* of navigation and fishing in mind. As regards the actual bed of the sea, Oppenhelm appears to take tne view that it can only be occupied on grounds of long continued usage (see Note 1 on Page 507), but the Sditor of Oppenneim takes a different view (see page 514, and Note on that page) and quotes authorities for and against. Sirthat z) 31 r Cecil Hurst refers to sedentary fisheries in an article in the Jritiah Year Book of International Law, 1923-24. He states that the principles laid down by oppenheim regarding the sub-aoil are in no way inconsistent with the right of exclusive ownership of the sea bed arising from undisputed occupation of sedentary fisheries lying on the surface of the bed of the sea. Me further says that where effective occupation has been long maintained of portions of the bed of the sea outside the three-mile limit, these claims are valid, and subsisting claims entitled to recognition by otner states, and he ends up by a statement that the claim to the exclusive ownership of a portion of the bed of the sea, and of the wealth which it produces, is not inconsistent with the universal right of navigation in the open sea or with the common right 01 the public to fish in the high seas. In a reply made at a meeting held at the Foreign Office in February 1927 to consider Indian and Ceylon olaims to sedentary fisheries, 3ir Cecil, however, agreed that a claim to rights in the bed of the sea must be prior in date to the doctrine of territorial waters, and that if such a claim had not been nacie up to date it could not be made in future {Foreign Office letter T.1544/670/380 of 8th February of 1927). Admiralty policy hitherto has been strongly against accepting the vie that ownership of the bed of the sea outside territorial waters can be established, except where such right may be said to exist already by prescrir&gt;tlon, though in the c^ee of the Channel Tunnel, the Committee of Civil Research were infomed that the Admiralty would see no objection from the Haval point of view to the acceptance of the theory of ownership of the bed or the sea outside territorial waters, if this did not involve restrictions on the use of the waters over such portions of the bed of tiie sea in regard to which ownership may be conceded. The Admiralty stated, however, t iat they were not satisfied&lt;£3&gt; Zl(* that the application of the theory would not involve restrictions that would hamper the use of sea power in war. T 0 pass to the practical requirements involved in the exploitation of submarine oilfields, it is understood that for the purpose of submarine boring, steel structures resting on the bottom of the sea, and analogous therefore to artificial islands, are essential. It would also be necessary to make arrangements for shipping the oil asit flowed from the v/ells. As regards the 'artificial islands ’ certain Governments, e.g. Denmark and Holland, assert that such islands are capable of possessing their own territorial waters. The application of this doctrine would probably mean that the whole of a submarine oilfield would become territorial waters, for obvious reasons. It is to be observed, however, that Oppenheim considers that a lighthouse on the high seas (which corresponds in some ways to such artificial formations) should be treated on the same lines as anchored lightships (Oppenheim, page 403) and that a belt of territorial waters round it cannot be claimed. Westlake and Lindley (for a different reason) agree. This is also the policy of His Kejesty’s Government, and this policy applies generally to artificial structures raised on rocks or banks not in them selves constituting islands (see reply to League of Nations in 1929). At the same time, the general view at the Hague Conference of 1930 was that they should be regarded as islands, and have a territorial belt. There are also obvious objections to a state being permitted to erect such structures in positions adjacent to the territorial waters of its neighbours. Could we, for example, contemplate Germany (say) erecting a structure on the Dogger Bank, or i^’rance (say) on the Goodwin Sands? As a safeguard ough there not, therefore, to be a condition that such action could only be taken in close proximity to territorial waters? ASZ/7 As ysgards the effect of the boring structures, etc* , on navigation, it would clearly be essential to establish the principle that nothing should be done which would interfere with the right of free navigation* The structures would have to ! e properly lighted, and so arranged that free passage was not obstructed, with reasonable intervals between them. It would also be desirable to avoid anything like the development of an oil port* on the high seas. Amongst ©tier matters of lesser importance, it would be necessary to provide for compensation for damage wilfully or neglige tly caused by or to the structures. For submarine cables, the principle has been accepted by an International Convention that intentional or culpable negligent damage by other users of the open sea is to be punished unless done in self-preservatior;, rut provision is lode for the owners of cables to coin pen sate ships which have sacrificed an anchor, net or other fishing gear in order to avoid damaging a cable The general line suggested by the foregoing is that:* 1. The development of submarine oilfields is probably inevitable, mo it is important from the point of view ot British policy that such development should taie place without an increase in the areas appropriated as national or territorial waters, it is equally important that we should obtain our fair share of this development* 2. raere is good warrant in the international law authorities for saying that the bed of the high sea and thesub-soil thereunder are objects capable of national appropriation. A country might therefore legitimately assume sovereignty on r the bed of a portion of the high sea, and the sub-soil thereunder, provided that he dl f prejudice the natural condition of the neighbouring state*® territory, or trespass upon what might be regarded as the corresponding inchoate rignts ol appropriation vested in his neighbour. A reasonable arrangement would be that a country shoul. e &gt;iven the right to allow the erection of the necessary works to bore for oil in a position ‘on the ligr sear in proximity to its own territorial waters. (It(it ia not Known whether any shallow arerAs away from lario are likely to lecorne possible sources of supply of oil. If there are any such, which is perhaps unlikely, the only way of dealing with them would see r i to be to have a Convention between the powers whose territories are nearest, and any other powers which could claim to be specially interested* This, however, raises more complicated questions, and unless there is any need for going into the matter now, it would toeut better to leave it to be dealt with in the future if it arose). 3u ® h , should be subject to navigation and fishing not being perceptibly interfered with. Any structure must be limited to the smallest structure suit ble - or the purpose of extracting the oil, and muHt be adequately marked and lighted. ompenoation must be paid for any damage, includinp 0r damage due t0 culpable negligence *, caused to ships or vessels or fishing gear by the structure or by any pipeline leading to it. a e QH extracted should preferably be pumped by pipes to the shore or to .a point inside territorial waters, there should be no development of an oiling poit on the high seas, with its concomitant of vessels coming and going.

Secretary Eden to regueat you to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following observations on your letter to the Colonial Office Ho. M*395/56 of the 9th April last regarding the development of submarine oil boring areas adjacent to the seaboard of I’rinidad. 3. It is noted tnat while your department a.gree generally with the line taken by the foreign Office in their letter to the Colonial Office No. A 878/878/47 of the 17th March last, they have expressed certain additional views. 3. In particular, your department suggest that the right to occupy the bed of the sea outside territorial waters should be so limited that a country would only possess the right to occupy those pgrts of the bed of the High Seas which are more or lees adjacent to its own territorial waters and more especially so that a country should not have the right of occupying parts of the bed of the High Seas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of another country. Ur. Men is advised that (apart from specific agreement to the contrary) if there is a right to occupy the bed of the sea outside territorial waters, then that right must be held to extend to any part of the bed of the sea which does not in fact consist of the The Secretary to the Admiralty, territorialm 2 TO territorial waters of another country and which has not preriously heen occupied* Such a right can no more be limited to certain parts of the bed of the sea than the right to occupy unoccupied territory on dry land could be limited to certain unoccupied territory to the exclusion of other such territory. 4. Your memorandum also discusses the danger that appropriation of the bed of the High Seas together with the conduct of boring operations from abcwe might result in some extension of territorial waters* and that oountries whose vessels are engaged in boring operations at sea in respect of part of the bed of the sea beneath which they had appropriated, might tend to claim as territorial waters the waters lying round the vessels or other permanent artificial works employed in the boring operations. tfhile Mr. iMen is fully in agreement with the view expressed in the memorandum, namely that such a claim could not possibly be admitted, he. does not feel that thore is any real danger of such a claim being established, since the best view appears to be that, generally speaking, artificial islands or stationary vessels cannot be made the basis of a claim to territorial waters round them. further, the writers who admit the possibility ol* occupying the bed of the sea 3 bate specifically that such occupation must not be allowed to interfere with the freedom of navigation and, moreover, that it does not imply or involve any claim to the occupation of part of the actual High Seas themselves. 5. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Colonial Office, Dominions Office and Petroleum Department. 1 am, etc. { 3gd. ) J.M. TRUUTBKCK.15043/3B/36. June, 1936 Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Ornsby-Gore to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. A 878/870/47 of the Ivth of March, submitting observations as to the possibility and desirability of concluding an agreement with Venezuela for the control of the submarine oil-bearing areas in the Gulf of Paria between Trinidad and Venezuela. He has also considered the observations of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, contained in their letter 1.395/36 of the 9th of April, and the further comments in Foreign ffice letter A.3060/878/47 of the 6 th of May. 2. Mr. Onasby-Oore agrees with the observations of the Foreign Office and the Admiralty regarding the possibility of acquiring ownership of the bed of the sea without involving any extension of territorial waters. If Mr. Secretary Eden agrees, therefore, and subject to any further comments which the Admiralty or the Petroleum Department may have to offer, I am to request that THE infPEB SECRET ART OF STATE, FOREIGN OFFICE-V that JUe Majesty's representative in Venezuela may be instructed to open discussions forthwith with the Venezuelan Government on the possibility of their taking simultaneous and parallel action with the Government of Trinidad to divide up as national territory between them the sea bed of the Gulf of Paria or such parts of it as may be of use for oil borings and to discuss with the Venezuelan Government the method of division of the area in question between Trinidad and Venezuela. For this purpose I am to suggest that the line proposed by the Governor in his despatch of the 9th of December 1935 should be taken as a basis for negotiations. 3. Mr. Ormsby-Gore would propose, when instructions have been seat to His Majesty's representative in Venezuela to forward a copy of the instructions to the Governor of Trinidad, and to consider, in conjunction with the Governor, the measures which will be necessary to appropriate the portions of the sea bed falling to the Colony's 7JZ-~L iColony*s share as a result of the proposed negotiations. He will be grateful for any observations Mr. Kden may care to offer at this stage as to the proper legal procedure for such annexation. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, Petroleum Department, and Dominions Office. I am. Sir, Tour most obedient servant.P ?.

My Lords desire however to point out that the danger of an extension of territorial waters arises not only from the possible creation of ’’artificial islands' but also from the fact that countries who suspect that submarine deposits of oil exist under the high eeas bordering their coasts may be tempted, in the existing unoert&amp;in state of the law, to secure control over that oil by a simple extension of territorial waters.

He outlined the terms which had been offered by the two Companies and stated that both Companies, the Bahrein Petroleum Company in particular, appeared to attach great value to the potentialities of the Hawar group. He said also that he had got the impression that whereas the terms offered by the Bahrein Petroleum Company were in the nature of a final offer, Petroleum Concessions Ltd. might conceivably go higher. He mentioned that he thought the Sheikh was likely to be attracted by the large lump sum payment offered by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, but before making any final decision he was anxious to obtain the views of H.M.G. on the respective offers of the two Companies. Mr. Walton suggested that the Sheikh should ask the Petroleum Department to give their opinion.

It was explained to him that it would be impossible to give a final ruling without knowing whether the Sheikh of Qatr has a claim, and hearing it if he had one. Mr. Belgrave understood the position. He said that the Sheikh would enter the island in the list of his possessions to be given to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Mr. Belgrave was informed that there was no objection to the Sheikh negotiating with the two oil companies while in London, bat that this Office should be informed of the result of any negotiations conducted here.5 (2U P.Z. 4582/36. 140 y: v Tu a/U 4/P. ^/i/^ ?rju) There are two points for decision at the moment on this file. X. 1 The question of the ownership of the Islandsof Hawar. Please see the Resident’s letter of the 25th May, P.Z. 4362 / 36 , the Political Agent’s letter^ of the 6th / May # i/- P.Z. 3969/36 and the Government of India’s telegram of the 1st July, P.Z.4670/36. It will he seen that in 1919 certain claims were put forward hy the Sheikh of Bahrein to an area called Zuhara on the mainland of Qatar. It was then decided that the Bahrein claim to this area could not he sustained and that it belonged to the Sheikh of Qatar. No mention was then made of the Hawar Group of Islands and although, as Colonel Powle points out, the group is in comparatively close proximity to Zuhara the fact that there was no mention of Hawar at that time seems to make it unnecessary to regard the 1920 decision as affecting the present case. It is clear from the Political Agent’s and Political K Lil* •'*1 ***** Resident’s letter that, in point of fact, Hawar is treated as part of the territory of the Sheikh of Bahrein, i.e. the Sheikh and his father exercised active jurisdiction there for more than 50 years and he has no reason to suppose that the Sheikh of Qatar lays any claim to it. In these circumstances, it seems clear that Colonel Powle’s conclusion, which is supported hy the Government of India, is right viz. that Hawar should he regarded as belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein and that the burden of disproving his claim lies on the Sheikh of Qatar. A decision on these lines may not he entirely satisfactory to the Oil Companies concerned as there wouldAZ4I (S) “be always the possilDility that a company v/hich had obtained a concession for the unallotted area of Bahrein under the impression that it included the Hawar Islands Group, being subsequently faced with a decision that after all the Sheikh of Qatar had substantiated a claim to the Islandr on the basis of evidence not at present available. On the other hand, such a possibility is very remote and an oil company could, in obtaining a concession, make a proviso to the effect that payments under the concession might have to be revised if it subsequently turned out that the area was smaller than that envisaged at the time of the grant of the concession. This matter is coming up for discussion on Thursday afternoon at an inter-Departmental Conference and it is Kit jaaaygged be submitted, unless the meeting dissents, A it should be laid down by His Majesty* s Government that, on the basis of the evidence at present before them, Hawar appears to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein and that the burden of disproving the Sheikh of Bahrein’s claim lies on any other potential claimant. A decision in this sense might be conveyed at once to the Sheikh of Bahrein and Petroleum Concessions Limited who have raised the question. II. Question of direct negotiations in London between the Sheikh of Bahrein and oil Interests in regard to the unallotted area . Please see Resident’s Express Letter Tl tfil/ of the 22nd June, No. C/77 of 1936. In that letter the Resident suggests that negotiations might be carried on under auspices of the India Office between the Sheikh and the two companies who are competing for the unalloted area, namely,mm A; 5 ) 3 2^^ the Bahrein Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Apparently, the Sheikh is anxious himself to undertake negotiations and feels that as both companies have their headquarters it would be appropriate to do so in London. Subject to any observations the other departments may have to make, it is proposed to inform the Sheikh of Bahrein, through Mr. Belgrave, that there is no objection to His Excellency negotiating with the two companies while he is in London provided he keeps the India Office informed of the progress of the negotiations. There will hardly be time for much progress before the Sheikh is due to return (20th July). As regards^Jabove, the proposed reply about Hawar seems the best in the circumstances. It is a provisional decision; a final decision clearly could not be reached without hearing Qatr’s claim (if any), and one would think that he might have a supportable claim, as the island is only five miles from the mainland. If the B.P.C. get the concession of the unallotted area, their rivals^Petroleum Concessions Ltd. ^might be inclined to dispute our provisional decision on Hawar, and we might then get a claim from the Sheikh of Qatr which would necessitate a final decision on the part of H.M.G. Qatr may of course make a claim in any case, but it hardly seems necessary to put it into his head by asking whether he has one.Confidential. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

In continuation of my Printed letter No^404-S dated the 19th May 1956. 2. It is convenient to deal first with the statement in the first paragraph of Mr. Skliros 1 letter of 29th April 1936 (India Office Printed letter No.P*Z.2975/36 dated the 5th May 1936) that the fact of the Island of Hawar being shown on the map annexed to the Qatar Oil Concession is proof that the Island belongs to Qatar. The map in question showed not only Qatar, but part of the neighbour ing territory including the Islands of Bahrain, so that the fact of Hawar appearing on it is of course no proof of ownership one way or the other. p?.'. 22 JUN1936 s ’ 6 ' Colonel Loch has referred in paragraphs 3 and 4 of his letter / MFP—1515 8&amp;P—(M-2089)—2-4-35—200,000.6. / - 2 - (2SSJ letter No.C/217 dated the 6 th May 1936 to the representations made by Shaikh Abdullah in London in 1919. Though the question of the ownership of the island of Hawar was not specifically mentioned then by Shaikh Abdullah, in view of its close proximity to Zubara it is useful to examine the connection of the Al Khalifah family of Bahrain with the latter place. 4. A note on the History of Zubara and the claims of the Shaikh of Bahrain thereto is attached to letter No.3650 dated the 31st January 1920, from the Acting Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. It will be seen from this letter that the Al Khalifah family first settled in Zubara in 1766, that it was thence that they captured Bahrain in 1782, that subsequently a member of the family (who was expelled from Bahrain^ rebuilt the town of Zubara in 1842, and that it was not until about 1850 that the Al Than! (the present ruling family of Qatar) rose to power in Zubara. 5. The representations of Shaikh Abdullah were replied to by the Government of India in their letter No.D.O.1145-E.A. dated the 5th May 1920. As regards Zubara the reply stated that the Government of India did not see their way to w permit and assist n the Shaikh of Bahrain to open a port at Zubara. From the use of the word n permit n I infer that this refusal was tantamount to a denial of the Shaikh of Bahrain* s claim to Zubara. * If therefore Hawar, from its proximity to the mainland of Qatar (it is described at page 1513 of Volume II of the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf as lying S imiles due west of the point of Has Aburuk) is held to follow the owner ship of the mainland, it would fall under Qatar.6. On the other hand, the Government of India decision (if it may be taken as such) referred to in my paragraph 5 above did not specifically refer to Hawar, it is beyond doubt that the Island has long been occupied by the Dowasir tribe of Bahrain (vide paragraph 7 of letter No.207 dated the 4th April 1909 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Political Resident, copy forward ed to the Government of India under the latter 1 s letter No.1043 dated the 2nd May 1909, and the reference to the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf quoted in my paragraph 5 above), and it appears beyond doubt that the present Shaikh of Bahrain’s father (who succeeded in 1869) and the Shaikh himself have exercised active jurisdiction in Hawar down to the present day, (vide paragraphs 4-6 of letter No.C/180 dated the 28th April 1936 from the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain to the Political Agent, Bahrain), apparently without interference or protest by the Shaikh of Qatar. 7. In all the circumstances of the case, I incline to the view that Hawar should be regarded as belonging to the Shaikh of Bahrain and that the burden of disproving his claim lies on the Shaikh of Qatar. We have heard nothing on the subject from the Shaikh of Qatar, and it is quite possible that he may not dispute the claim of the Shaikh of Bahrain. 8 . The decision as to the ownership of Hawar may, according to Major Holmes (vide paragraph 3 of Captain Hickinbotham's letter No.C/224 dated the 9th May 1936), affect the future activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company as, if it is awarded to Bahrain, that Company may think it worth while to compete with Petroleum Concessions Limited for the remaining area. sd.

P.2. 4298/36. 23rd June 1936. / I enclose a copy of a note regarding a conversation with Mr.Ballantyne on the subject of (a) the Unallotted Area of Bahrein, and (h) the marketing arrangements being made by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As regards (a), we must presumably leave the Bahrein petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited to fight it out with the Sheikh. As regards (b), Mr.Ballantyne pointed out that it was not for him as a servant of the Company to suggest that His Majesty 1 s Government might want to make any requests to the Company or comment on their scheme, but the Company were particularly anxious that His Majesty s Government should be fully informed, and it occurred to him that it would be in the best ultimate interests of the Company that His Majesty’s Government should be quite satisfied that their interests were not going to be adversely affected by W. Rendel Esq*, C.M.G. Foreign Office. the/2 . the importation of a new principle which might conceivably at some later stage lead to undesirable complications* I understand that the Texas Company are themselves a most respectable organisation and purely American ( Starling will be able, of course to confirm whether this is the #ase) but their importation into the Bahrein Company means that they will have a share not only in the marketing but also in the producing side of the business and this might presumedly lead to further developments, e.g. if the Texas Company subsequently got attached to some other perhaps not American Company, (perhaps Japanese) which might not be desirable from His Majesty’s Government’s point of view. It might be worth considering whether we should intimate to the Bahrein Petroleum Company that while His Majesty’s Government quite appreciate that it is necessary for the Company to make arrangements to market its oil (and this is all to the good so far as the Sheikh’s revenues as-e concerned) His Majesty's Government view with some disquiet the introduction of new interests into the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and they look to the Company to ensure by some/1^5 V-' 1/ 3. some appropriate means that His Majesty’s Government are safeguarded from the possibility of further outside bodies acquiring interests in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. They would, for instance, suggest that provision might be made whereby none of the share capital of the Bahrein Petroleum Company could be alienated without the consent of His Majesty’s Government, and that the capital could not be increased without similar consent. This of course is a very tentative suggestion for consideration. The papers are being referred to our Legal Adviser for his observations and in the meantime I should be glad if you would kindly let me know whether you have any observations to offer on the scheme or on the line that Hie Majesty’s Government might take in regard to future safeguards* It is, of course, possible that if the Bahrein Petroleum Company get the unallotted area in Bahrein, the main lease will have to be amended to cover the new holding* That may be an opportunity for putting in any safeguards that might be decided upon in the present connection^ Mr.Ballantyne is, of course, anxious for an early reply.I am sending a similar letter to Starling and Seal.

From The Adviser to the Gavei*nment of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, In connection with the present negotiations for an oil concession over the territory of Bahrain which is not included in the 13E5 oil concession I have the honour to inform you that His excellency Shaikh uir Hamad bin Isa al~Mhalifah, n.G.I. 0.5.1., lias instructed me to state to you that the Ha war group of islands lying between the southern extremity of Bahrain island and the coast of Mattar is indisputably part of the State of Bahrain. £. His Axcellency^mentiorued this fact to His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agents in Bahrain and he wishes to remind you that he informed you that Eawar belonged to Bahrain when accompanied by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al-Kbalifah and myself he called on you on 18th April 1336 to discuss the Question of a new oil concession. as he regards his sovereignty over the Hawar islands which includes one of the largest -—Z66 2 - largest islands belonging to Bahrain as a matter of very great importance he considers that the fact should be stated officially in writing. o. The iiawar group of islanus include the following named islands as well as a number of small islets. 1. Soon 2. Meshtaan 3* Al-liaterrad 4. hubadh 5. Hawar 6. Ginan 7. Mahazw&amp;rah 4. ikt least four of the larger islands are permanently occupied by His Excellency^ subjects who live there in stone houses as well as barastis and who are the owners of valuable fishtraps round the coasts of the islands which they acquired by purchase or gift under the seal of the late Ehaikh of Bahrain, Shaikh Sir Isa bin nli al-hhaiifah, and also His excellency Shaiidi Hamad. 5. The inhabitants of the Hawar islands and their forefathers are and alwaj's have been the subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain in whose territory they are living. 6. The people of Ilawar are today and always have been under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrain. They appear in the Bahrain Courts in answer to summonses which are served on them in Hawar and all their cases and disputes are dealt with in the Bahrain Courts. Recently in —in connection with a quarrel between some of the people in uawar, the Bahrain police had occasion to make several arrests in Hawar and to produce trie persons in the Baiirain Court.

I have to thank Your Excellency for your letter dated April 30th 1036 in which Your Excellency gives details of alterations you desire made in several of the Articles of tae Draft Agreement for an Oil Concession dealing with the outside Area of the State of Bahrain and being those Areas not included in the Concession Area now held by tne Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. I will deal with the points raised in tne same order as Your Excerlency has done- in your letter* Article 1* This carls for little comment* If Your Excellency would kindly give instructions that an Official List and , reeise description of the Islands - be.-dnging to the State of Bahrain - be supplied to me by the Bahrain Government Office, I shall be pleased to insert them in full in the Draft Agreement. I have no other means of obtaining a list of and the names of the Islands, or I should not troubxe Your Excellency. Ar ticle 2 * Tne years are calendar years* Article 11(a) . I note Your Excellency^ remarks under this heading and shall pass them on to the London Office of Petroleum Concessions Limited ( for whom I am acting), for consideration* I would remark however that Your Excellency conveys the Inuression - by demanding the same rate of Royalty as that paid by tne Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited/27/ 2. Limited - that the conditions of operating and working other oil deposits (if any) in the State of Bahrain will 1 be much tae same as at present. Operation and pro duction charges carried out in Territorial Water Areas and on scattered Islauos are j-ikely to prove much more costly than those pertaining uncer tne ideao. conditions of the Bahrain Petr&amp;ieum Compands Limited Area. So consideration is usually given to difficult and costly working conditions by way of a lesser Royalty, especially when a much smaller Area is concerned as is tue case In the present instance. However as stated above, I shall refer both the questions raised under this heading by Your iotce-Llency, to the London Office of n$- Company. ArtiC-Le 15(a) . I appreciate that Your Excellency desires to preserve the amenities of the towns of Manaaaxi and Moharraq by means of open areas. Would it be asking too much to request Your Excellency to give instructions to the Bahrain Ooverment Offices to give me precise particulars as to the limits of the open areas that Your Excellency wishes to preserve against encroachment by the Company. Further a copy of the Aircraft Regulations of the State of Bahrain - if pro curable from the Bahrain Government Office - would be of great help to my Company. Article 15(c). I should be pleased if Your Excellency would instruct the Bahrain Government Offices to give details of how Your Excellency requires this Article 13(c) altered as it appears to me - in its present form- to cover the point raised in Your Excellency 1 s letter. Article 16(b) . I note the emendation desired in this Article of the Draft Agreement. Article £3. Tnereis no question of transferring the Agreement to a tuird petty, Petroleum Concessions bimited intend to form a Company to take care of each Concession obtained, tne Company so forme ou-d bebe financed from within Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Company in this instance woUud be called Petroleum Concession (Bahrain) Limited, controlled and operated by Petroleum Concessions Limited. However I will bring the question before the London Office of Petroleum Con cessions Limited, and if I received from tne Ba&gt; rain Government Offices the exact wording and form tnat lour Excellency desires this Article to hr ve, I will forward that also to the London Office. I anticipate no difficulty in adjusting the point raised to the satisfaction of Your Excellency. 2. In respect of the addition of the matter of drilling obligations, I offer no opinion but would bring to the notice of Your Excellency as it is most probable that drilling may have to be undertaken on areas subject to tidal influence, it becomes difficult to lay down drilling obligations in such circumstances. I snail forward the suggestion to Petroleum Concessions Limited for their views. 3. I note A our Excellency 1 s decision that you do not propose to discuss the remapning financial matters which are in this Agreement before the matters raised in Your Excellency^ letter have been agreed. I foresee that there vill be considerable delay before the above arid remaining financial matters have been settled as between Your Excellency^ Govern ment and my Company, therefore - with Your Exeei-i-ency* s permission - I propose returning to Kuwait for some weeks, but hope to be available - at any time agreeable to Your Exceixency - shortly after I receive iiistructions - on the questions raised in Your Excellency^ letter - from my London Office.

BAHRAIN. 2&lt;,, i/ C ' i A 1. Major Holmes rather to my surprise said that though he had informed Mr. Skinner informally of the P.C.L. l s proposal to obtain a concession from the Shaikh with regard to the remaining area of Bahrain not covered by the Bahrain petroleum Company's concession, Mr. Skinner did not appear in any way perturbed, nor did he (Major H.) think that the B.P.C. proposed to compete with the P.C.L. in the matter of the remaining area. However, he will be able to confirm this attitude when he returns to Bahrain. 2. Major Holmes said that Mr. Skinner had informed him that they - the B.P.C. - were ,T sitting pretty” with. His Majesty* s Government, i.e. were on good terms with them. That the B.P.C. much appreciated the sympathetic attitude and assistance which His Majesty's Government had extended towards them and were out to reciprocate in every way possible. 3. * The question of the rights of the B.P.C. outside their actual oil area in the matter of fresh water, telephones, pipe-lines, Sitra harbour, roads, etc. was then discussed. To cover these rights a Clause 22(a) had, at the suggestion of the India Office (see India Office telegram No.987 of 18th March 1936) been inserted in the proposed Leased Area by Major H. 1 suggested that Major H. might go into the various points concerned with Mr. Skinner and to report accordingly to his Company or this might be deferred until the P.C.L. had actually got their concession, it was presumably for the Company to decide.2 . &lt;SD 4. The question of flying facilities for the P.C.L. was then din cussed. Major H. 1 s general idea seemed to be that the P.C.L. might establish a sort of centre in Bahrain in touch by air with the other areas, chiefly the Trucial Coast. 1 pointed out that the Rulers of Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat had forbidden private flyers to fly over or land in their territories. The idea of this was to prevent single-engined machines flying down the Arab Coast which is unsuitable for such machines, and it might be possible to obtain permission for commercial planes of the P.C.L. to fly over these areas. (There is no mention of flying rights in the B.P.C. concession, and they do not require such rights since their area of operations is a small one, while P.C.L., if they obtain all the concessions they want, will cover the whole of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf). 5. On the assumption that the P.C.L. would obtain their concession 1 raised the question as to whether their drilling operations would interfere with those of the B.P.C. r . whether their wells might not tap the latter’s supply. Such a state of affairs had, I understood, occurred in some Oil-field where two rival Companies were operating side by side. Major H. said that to meet such an eventuality he had inserted a new paragraph instead of the present one under Article 22 of the proposed Leased Area concession which he had shown informally to Mr. Skinner who had agreed that it was satisfactory. The last words of this paragraph read as followss TI Further THE COMPANY agrees that drilling, producing and plugging operations will conform with good oil field practice and will at all times fully protect Horizons from which the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited are producing, such protection to be to the complete satisfaction of His Britannic Maj esty 1 s Government. n For/3. For n His Britannic Majesty's Government' at the end of the paragraph Colonel Loch, so Major H. informed me, had suggested that 'the Shaikh' should be substituted. (The Shaikh is obviously the interested party but he will of course look to His Majesty's Government for advice on such a technical matter, and 1 suggest that the words 'of the Shaikh acting on the advice of His Majesty's Government' should be substituted for 'of His Britannic Maj esty's Government').

Dear Mr* Walton, We are, as you know, now negotiating with the Shaikh of Bahrain for that part of his group of islands which has not already been given to the Californians. He has coramenced by claiming that the Island of Hawar is part of his dominions. This island is, in fact, situated off the west coast of Qatar, from which it seems to be not mor^ than 3/4 miles distant at its nearest point. The island is shown on the official map of Qatar which was signed by the Shaikh of Qatar and by Mr. Mylles and which forms part of the Qatar Concession* This map, I believe, was seen and approved by the Political Resident and, perhaps, the India Office* All this points to its forming part of Qatar and not of Bahrain. The island is about 10 miles long, about 2 miles wide at its widest and is believed to be uninhabited.

I find, however, that we have no knowledge of the terms of the Lease (to the Bahrein Petroleum Company) dated December 29 th, 1934, and this suggests the reflection that there may be various other leases or modifications of the original Concession given on December 2nd, 1925* to the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, and that these, or some of them, may be such as to concern an intending Concessionaire of the remaining portions of that group of islands. I am not certain that this is information for which I can legitimately ask. If it is not, please overlook the impropriety, but if it is, and if you can tell us what are the contents of the 1934 or any other similar leases or documents, I should be very much obliged.

He said that he was probably going to San Francisco this week and was anxious to talk about the present position in regard to the unallotted area, as this was a matter which no doubt his Principals would want to discuss with him. He said he had had a communication from Mr. Skinner, the chief local representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Political Agent enquiring, at the request of the Sheikh, whether the B.P.C. wished to make a counter offer to that of Petroleum Concessions Limited for the unallotted area. 1 Mr. Skinner /i also reported that Major Holmes had had a talk with him and had endeavoured to explain how it was that he was now working for a company other than the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein. Mr. Ballantyne said he was sure that the B.P.C. would not want to do anything embarrassing to H.M.G. and he did not know at all what their reaction would be to the Sheikh’s communication and to the position as a whole, it seemed very questionable whether there was oil in any commercial quantities in the unallotted area and in these circumstances it was difficult to say what good reason there could be for P.C*L. to interest themselves in it. The idea which was floating- in his (Mr. Ballantyne»s) mind was that possibly some kind of arrangement might be made whereby B.P.C. and P.C.L. might jointly make an exploration of the area in order to determine whether or not there is, in fact, oil in any commercial quantities there. This, however/2 . however, was merely a personal idea of his own and he had no idea what his Company 1 s views might be. What, however, he thought would be the best practicably step to take in the first instance would be to reply to the Political Agent that the company would like a little time to think over the Sheikh’s communication. It seemed to him that it was undesirable to do anything in a hurry. I told Mr. Ballantyne that H.M.G.’s position in the matter was quite simple. P.C.L. had come to them with a request for permission to approach the Sheikh with a view to a concession for the unallotted area. H.M.G. had told P.C.L. that they had no objection to them approaching the Sheikh, subject to the usual conditions, i.e. that no concession could be concluded without H.M.G.’s permission and that political safeguards would have to be provided. H.M.G. (this for Mr. Ballantyne’s personal information) did not think it desirable or proper to ’’start an auction' by informing the B.P.C. that P.C.L. were applying to the Sheikh, but it was present to their minds that the Sheikh would almost certainly ask B.P.C. for a counter offer. This was apparently what had happened (though we had not yet received any official report from Bahrein). If the B.P.C. decided to accept the Sheikh’s suggestion and put in a counter offer, H.M.G. would undoubtedly agree to the company doing so through their local representative or some other representative in Bahrein, the first approach being made through the Political Agent, who would of course have to be kept informed of the progress of the negotiations. H.M.G.’s view^ expressed in 1933^was that, in regard to the unallotted area, the field is open, H.M.G. being/aid) ~\0(s 3 . being concerned only with insisting on the necessary political safeguards and giving such advice to the Sheikh to guard his interests as they might be able to. In the course of conversation Mr. Ballantyne mentioned that he understood from Mr. Skinner that any concession which might be given to P.C.L. would certainly safeguard the existing rights of B.P.C. 1 confirmed that this was the case and that H.M.G. would certainly, in any such contingency, give the Sheikh the best advice they could in order to ensure that in any conflict of rights under the two concessions the precedent rights of the B.P.C. should predominate. As regards Mr. Ballantyne»s idea of sending a temporising reply to the Sheikh’s enquiry, 1 said that this was, of course, a matter for them to decide. H.M.G. were naturally anxious to see such settled and done with as soon as possible, but so far as I knew there was no very immediate urgency; ^however *4. v/as^ of 'orurr^rjv — r hough t 3.1- ~L 1 ■.-* ■tf, ,.L.. „ ' ■ ■■!; w ■ 'T'\ M M.. n T n.-mit.

Letter to Mr. Rendel (also Messrs. Starling and Seal) dated 4th November.

(4) P.Z.1254/36 - Note of an interdepartmental discussion at the India Office on 21st February, 1936. The gist of these papers is that Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., (a company which is for practical purposes identical with the Iraq Petroleum Company) have applied to H.M.G. for permission to negotiate oil concessions with the rulers of Bahrein (in respect of the portion of Bahrein not taken up by the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s concession, which covers 100,000 acres, i.e. somewhere in the neighbourhood of half the area of Bahrein), Muscat, the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms, and Koweit (in respect of his oil rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone, i.e. the neutral territory between the dominions of the Sheikh of Koweit and those of Ibn Saud, in which neither ruler can grant an oil concession without the co-operation of the other). Draft concessions in regard to each territory have been prepared by the Company, whose agent (Major Holmes) is at present in the Gulf, waiting to open negotiations with the rulers in turn. These draft concessions have been communicated to H.M.G. and are at P.Z. 759/36 (except the Muscat draft, which is at P.Z./VlO 2 . P.Z. 1635/36 - the Muscat draft follows, however, the same lines as the Trucial drafts and so may he disregarded for the present)* The Drafts have 'been scrutinised in a preliminary way hy the departments concerned (the Petroleum Department particularly) and appear to he prima facie reasonable, from the point of view of the Rulers concerned, as a basis for negotiation. They will of course have to he examined in the light of local circumstances hy the Political authorities in the Gulf and hy the Rulers themselves* The Drafts fall into three categories (1) the Bahrein draft, (2) the Trucial Coast drafts - Ahu Dhabi, Ras-al-Khaimah, Dubai, Shargah - which are all on the same model, (3) the Koweit Neutral Zone draft* Of these, the Bahrein draft is the most important from our point of view, in that it seems very desirable to make sure that the terms of the concession would not conflict with the terms of the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s concession. A copy of the latter concession is attached for reference- political Department would he glad if you would kindly look at the Bahrein draft with this point in view. The Department would also he glad if you would say whether any points occur to you at first sight in regard to (2) the Trucial ’common form’ draft, (3) the Neutral Zone draft. The trucial draft seems to follow, very roughly the same kind of lines as the Qatar concession, copy of which, and of the Koweit (proper) Concession, is attached, though the arrangement is not the same. In due course ’’Political Agreements” (between H.M.G. and the Company) will have to he drawn up, hut this need not he done for the moment. M. J. Clauson, Note below, 12/3* H.G.

Then question of oiDtions has been disposed of (see my telegram No. 832, dated 7th March) there is no objection to Holmes opening negotiations with Sheikhs whom he would invite to Bahrein for the purpose. He should make his first approach to them through the Political Agent, who should be kept in close touch with the progress of the negotiations. The following/2. ^23 following preliminary conclusions have been reached at this stage on questions of (1) Boundaries, (2) Protection* As regards (l), it will be sufficient at this stage to define areas of concessions as those of the respective Sheikhdoms without annexing maps, but eventually it will be desirable to define boundaries so far as possible, and His Majesty’s Government accordingly suggest that Resident should take steps as soon as possible to enquire into boundaries of various Sheikhdoms inter s e and ^io — a—vi_s Muscat. Question of boundary between xtbu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would depend on course of negotiations with Ibn Saud. as regards (2) His Majesty's Government are inclined to view that so far as possible all resxDonsibility for protection should be placed by the concession agreement on Sheikhs themselves (compare Article 15 of draft concessions and condition (c) attached to approval of the options), but provision could also be made in political agreements and in accompanying exchange of letters between Government and bheikhs concerned that any movements of Company’s employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance into the hinterland) should be subject to prior written permission of Sheikh who would thusbe responsible for saying where Company could operate and consequently (in the event ot any incident occurring) for taking all possible action against the culprits and paying any compensation which His Majesty’s Government might consider necessary. 6 . as regards Bahrein, Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat, we should emphasise both to Holmes and the rulers concerned in informing them of permission to start negotiations that no concession can be finally concluded without specific further approval of His Majesty’s Government, who would require Company to enter into separate/327 separate political agreement with them. 7. Please see separate telegram regarding Kov/eit Neutral Zone. 8. I should he glad of your and Resident’s concurrence or observations in above proposals.

I think that it is clearly understood between us that Major Holmes will not approach any of the Sheikhs until the Company receives an official reply to their letter of 30th January. (Y/e are doing everything possible to expedite a reply in regard to the other areas, but the question of the Koweit Neutral Zone is specially complicated so that our reply in regard to that will have to be suspended pending further consultations.) We note from your letter of 30th January that Major Holmes has been instructed that he should not enter into any negotiations before he has obtained the Resident's approval. I suppose therefore that we may telegram to colonel Fowle that his assumption is correct, but should be glad if you could send a line to confirm this. 3. Colonel Fowle also suggests that copies of the relevant draft concessions should be sent to the political Agents at Bahrein and Koweit. Would it be at all possible for you to give us yet one more setfor the purpose of sending a copy of the Koweit Neutral Zone draft to the political Agent, Koweit, and of the remainder to the political Agent, Bahrein. Yours sincerely, (SD.) J.C.WALTON. J.Skliros, Esq., Petroleum Concessions Limited, City-Gate House, E.C.2337 P.Z, 1254/36. ITote of Conclusions of a meeting held at —Ay the India Office on Friday, 21st February, 1936. A meeting of the following representatives of the Departments concerned was held at the India Office on February 21st to consider whether His Majesty’s Government could authorise the proposal of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. to enter into negotiations for oil concessions in Bahrein, the Kuwait Neutral Zone and the six Trucial Sheikhdoms: Mr. Walt on ) Mr.Clauson ) India Office. Lord Hood ) Mr.Rendel ) Mr.Brenan ) Foreign Office. Mr.Seal Admiralty. W;i ng C oramand er) Pirie ) Air Ministry. Mr.Gunn Petroleum Department, (l) Bahrein. It was agreed that Petroleum Concessions Limited should be allowed to open negotiations with the Sheikh for a concession on the basis of the draft which they had submitted, on the understanding that any concession would be subject to His Majesty’s Government's approval and would be accompanied by a 'political' agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government. A question was raised whether it might perhaps be well l, o inform the Bahrein x J etroleum Company, with whom certain correspondence regarding the unallotted area took place in 1933, that Petroleum33S 2 . Concessions Limited were entering into negotiations with the Sheikh. A decision on this point was left to the India Office but it was felt that it would probably be preferable not to do so. M upcat ^ It was agreed that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. might approach the ^Gltan with- a view to opening negotiations for ai concession (on the same understandings as inXhe case of Bahrein). Trucial Sheikhdoms. It/was agreed that .petroleum Concessions Limitety should be allowed to enter into negotiations tfith the Sheikhs with a view to obtaining concessions on the basis of tne drafts submitted. ly this connection the following points arose (a) Boundaries./ It was agreed that for tne purposes of tlie concessions it would be sufficient to define the areas in question as 'the territories of the Sheikh'. Mr.Rendel, however, suggested that it was feasible arm desirable to fix forthwith the boundaries/of the various Trucial Sheikhdoms, except ii/ the case of the Saudi-Abu Dhabi boundary. It was therefore agreed that Colonel Towle should be asked to submit his recommendations for the definition of the boui/daries of the Sheikhdoms inter se and i/liaVvhs Muscat, but that this need not dela; ie negotiations for the concessions.

Would you kindly refer to your letter of 29th November, No. M. 05032/35, and connected correspondence about the proposed activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in the Persian Gulf. I now enclose copies of the further correspondence noted in the margin, and copies of the draft concessions communicated From Petroleum Concessions Ltd. dated 30th January, 1936.

I v/ould suggest that we should now have an informal meeting of representatives of the interested departments (Foreign Office, Petroleum Department, Admiralty, and Air Ministry) to consider the situation. The following appear to be the main points for discussion. Bahrein and Muscat . Can the Coup any be allowed to authorise Holmes to start negotiations at Bahrein on the basis of the draft concession, and to approach the Sultan of Muscat, where if business resulted the ultimate E.A.Seal, Esq., Admiralty, 3.W.I.2 negotiations would follow the lines of the Trucial Coast drafts? Such permission would he given on the understanding that there will have to he concurrent Agreements between the Company and His majesty's Government• 4* Trucial Coast . On the question of procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the D’Arcy Exploration Company ( alias Anglo-Persian Oil Company) I have consulted Powle. That is a comparatively unimportant matter. The main question is whether we can now allow the Company to authorise Holmes to enter into negotiations with the various Sheikhs (who would visit Bahrein for the purpose) on the basis of the draft Concessions, subject, of course, to the concurrent negotiation of satisfactory agreements between the Company and His Majesty's Government. It will be noted that the Company, propose to apply for concessions straight away without waiting to do any exploratory work under the existing options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February and explained that their reasons for this are not any desire to rush us,- but that their arrangements with Ho lines make it desirable to get the whole tiling settled as soon as possible; and apart from this they wish to(g3) 74/1 3 . enter at once into firm agreements with the Sheikhs (from which of course the latter would benefit financially), because the price of the concessions might he unduly enhanced in the event (improbable though they think it) of oil having actually been found in one or more of the territories concerned before the concessions are obtained. 3- Vith a view to deciding whether permission can be given to commencement of the Trucial Coast negotiations, we may have to consider in a preliminary way at this stage certain points which will be fully dealt with at greater leisure, in consultation with the interested departments, Y/hen we prepare the Government agreements that will have to accompany the concession agreements, viz ., (l) the question of boundaries - on this, as you will see from ray letter of 7th February to Fowle, Skliros is quite ready to be accommodating, (2) the connected question of protection. As regards the latter point, Article 13 of the draft concessions puts certain responsibility on the Sheikh (which seems right, so far at any rate, as it goes). 6 . The question of a refinery will of course be dealt with in the Government agreement. i* Kuweit Neutral Zone . This question presents difficulties. Hitherto we have envisaged no more than4 . an attempt 'by the Company to obtain an option from the Sheikh. Now they want to commit the Sheikh to certain specific terms as the basis of any joint concession which might eventually be granted. Skliros states his position in his letter of February 6 th. The question is whether v;-e need object. 8 . If you agree that we should meet and discuss these questions? I would suggest Friday? 21st February? at 3«30 p.m. in the India Office. 9* I am sending similar letters to Rendel, Courtney and StaanLing.11'H'IA OFFICE, 34C P.Z.946/1936. Air Mail. LONDON, S. Yf . 1 7th February, 1936. Dated 30th January. With reierence to my letter of 31st January, r. Z. 677/36, and 2 ;)rev iou-S correspondence regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Limited, I enclose copy, v/irh six enclosures, of the Company’s reply to our official letter of 12th December. Copy is also enclosed of a demi-official letter which 1 sent to Skliros on 4th February, and his reply dated 6 th February. 2 . i/e shall of course be consulting you further, after obtaining the preliminary views of the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, regarding the various draft concessions enclosed with the letter of 30th January from Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The point on which 1 want to consult you at the moment is the procedure in regard to the approval of the options already obtained by the Anglo from the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E., BUSHIRE. Iranian Oil Company The original proposal/ (O2 . proposal 01 Petroleujn Concessions Limited in their letter of 24th October was that they should take transfer of these options from the Anglo -Iranian Oil Company, and we have signified that we would approve the grant of the options and their transfer on the conditions set out in paragraph 5 of our letter to Petroleum Concessions Limited of 12th December. The +-wo Companies now propose a somewhat different procedure - viz., that the options should not be transferred, because for technical reasons (presumably the wording of the option agreements) they are not transferable, and suggest that the approval of the opening of negotiations for actual concessions might be given at the same time as approval of the options. Skliros and Lefroy called here on 6 th February, and 1 explained to them that it may be some little time before approval can be given to the opening of negotiations for actual concessions on the lines of the draft concessions which they have sent us. In accordance with paragraph 5 (d) of our letter of 12th December approval has yet to be given to the commencement of negotiations for actual concessions, and though it is probable that we shall be able to give it, the question has yet to be decided in consultation with/CM 3 . \ 7 ith the other Departments and yourself, and might take a iirtle time to consider from the point of view of the possible commitments which would be involved in the eventual grant of concessions. (Two points which might have to be considered are, for example, the southern boundary of the Abu Dhabi concession, and the general principles which we might have to get clear in our own minds in advance in regard to the sort of provisions that should be made for the protection of the concessionaire. I dare say there will be no great difficulty on either point. Sbliros suggested at our talk on 6 th February that the southern boundary of the concessions might be kept indeterminate and said that he saw no reason why the Company should not agree that any operations to work a concession would be confined within whatever distance of the coast we pleased. But these points have to be considered.) I informed Skliros and Lefroy that we would let them have an official reply to the Company’s letter as soon as possible, but that there must be some little delay on account of the necessity of consulting the other authorities concerned. Meanwhile it is probable that Holmes may be able to fillin time by starting work in regard to the Bahrein concession and perhaps visiting Muscat, though he will not make any start at all until we inform Petroleum Concessions Limited that he may do so. 4 . Now with reference to the procedure in regard to the existing options. there seem to be two alternatives - ( 1 ) to approve the grant of the options to the Anglo-lranian Oil Company at once, on that Company agreeing to conditions (a), (b) and (d) and the Sheikhs concerned agreeing to condition (c); ( 2 ) to postpone approval of the options (a course to which the Anglo-lranian Oil Company have no objection) until we are in a position to approve the opening of negotiations for actual concessions; then to approach the Sheikhs in regard to condition (c), to explain to them the proposal that negotiations should be opened by Petroleum Concessions Limited, and then approve at the same time both the options and the opening of these further negotiations. The second alternative seems to have the merit of making one bite at the cherry with regard to the Sheikhs. It will in any case presumably be necessary for someone to/to explain to the Sheikhs how it comes about that, though it was the Anglo-lranian Oil Company' which obtained the options, it is Petroleum Concessions Limited which is negotiating ior concessions. It will, of course, primarily be for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company representatives in the Gulf to do this, and we understand that they will be instructed to introduce Holmes and give the necessary (explanation, but it will perhaps also be desirable that you, when the time comes, should inform the Sheikhs that His Majesty's Government approve the opening of negotiations under the options by Petroleum Concessions Limitud through Holmes, and that it will be understood that any concession concluded can only be granted subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government. As, therefore, it will probably be desirable to approach the Sheikhs at the time when Holmes opens his negotiations, you may think it the simplest and least troublesome course to postpone till then the approach to ■them in regard to the approval of the options and condition (c). Could you kindly let us know by telegraph which course you think preferable from your point of view? 5./5. 5. -'/'e are assuming, in viev T of your telegrain of 4t!i December, No. 995, that you have no objection to the employment of Holmes as the individual to oe entrusted oy the Company with the negotiations. 6 . Since this was written, Lefroy telephones that his Company are advised by Elkington that they should explain to the Sheikhs forthwith the present position in regard to the options and the proposal which is being made to His Majesty’ Government that their affiliated company, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., should negotiate concessions. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company aru instructing Elkington to act accordingly, subject to your prior approval of the messages to be sent to the Sheikhs. I do not think that this development greatly affects the choice between the two alternatives suggested above in regard to our own procedure, since when the proposal that P.C.L. should open negotiations for concessions has been approved by His Majesty’s Government, it will still no doubt be necessary or desiraole that you should inform the Sheikhs that this is the case. f U//PfALT1936. Petroleum Conceoeione Limited, City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, London, E.G.S. 6 th February, 1936- Lear Mr. Yfalton, In repl^ r to your letter of the 4th instant, I send herev/ith four more sets of the draft Concessions. 2 . I have discussed with Mr. Lefroy the formal transfer of the Trucial Coast options, hut although the two companies concerned are in entire agreement over P.C.L. negotiating and obtaining the Concessions in its own name, I gather that technically the options themselves are not transferable; Mr. Lefroy has offered to; clear up this matter with you. 3 . The operation of para.5(c) of your letter of the 12th December will nor arise for some time; the D’Arcy will not be sending out anyone, and P.C.L. does not propose to launch an exploratory party of two or three geologists until October next. Mr. Holmes has already left, but he does not propose to wander along the Trucial Coasu; his proposal was to take up residence in Bahrein, where the Company . will be in funds at the 'Eastern Bank, and with the approval of the Political Resident to request the Rulers of the Trucial Coast to call one at a time, discuss terms, sign, and take away their bags of Rupees. 4. It will be necessary, of course, for the D’Arcy to notify each Ruler that Mr. Holmes is negotiating with its full approval on behalf of P.C.L., and I hope that you can instruct the Political Resident to confirm to each/each Ruler that the candidature of P.C.L-, vice the D'Arcy, is acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. It would he most unfortunate if the Rulers, having granted these options to the D’Arcy, should maintain that Concessions can he granted only to the D’Arcy, and not to P.C.I.; as you are aware the D’Arcy is unable to hold these Concessions. 5. I agree that the Koweit Reutral Zone presents a distinct problem; recognising that it is impossible to negotiate simultaneously with the Sheikh and with King Abdul Aziz, I endeavoured to lay down in the draft the terms which would be binding on the Sheikh; similar terms would then be offered to King Abdul Aziz. If they do not reach his minimum, the terms must either be increased until he is satisfied - in which case the Sheikh would receive corresponding benefit - or the idea of obtaining a comprehensive Concession over the Neutral Zone would have to be dropped. In the latter alternative P.C.L. must pay to the Sheikh the whole of the option money that it will have contracted to pay during the five-year option period; it can then either retire from the scene, or it can elect to pay the increased yearly payments that will become applicable after the initial five-year option period, and persevere with King Abdul Aziz. I have accepted it as an essential preliminary to a successful negotiation of this Concession, having regard to the oil rights being under co-interested ownership, to bind one of the parties to certain definite terms, otherwise a negotiator appealing in turn to the Sheikh and then to King Abdul Aziz would be consigned from pillar to post. I am aware that King Abdul Aziz has bespoken his share of the oil rights in the Neutral Zone to the Standard Oil Company of California; he is reported to have hedged4 3. to the extent that he may be unable to ensure that the Standard ox Caliiornia shall have a 50y inoereau in any Gonipan^ r that obtains bnao Conoession* An • Holmes is my authority lor sayiny that King Abdul Atit and the olieihh have exonan^ed viev/Sj and tho/t a mei^er of standard ox Calixoriiia and Iract Petroleum Co. (or P.C.L.; in the proportions ox 10/60 shareholding, would be acceptable to the ding, and to the Sheihh. Such a proposition P.C.L. will not entertain, and it prefers to make an entirely unencumbered bid; seeing that the Sheikh i s ao yet Neutral lone , it seems to me that tne obvious thing for 1 HG . 1 . is t arrangement with him. Phis, of c Sncl. in a stale mate, whereby P .0 .1 - acquires the Sheikh’ s rights, the while Standard ox Galixornia holds the hing’s« phat, I think, ie the most likely situation to arise; it would not 'be entirely unacceptable to p .0 „L », as although involving gratuitous payments to the ^neikh i u v/ould a u xe vA t/ give us time to persuade King Abdul Axis, But ix sucn a siouaoion is CAbiiely unacceptable to Hit majesty's Government, I am open to discuss, at any time convenient to you some other line ox approach to une i-ieuux*cxl jjone pxObX^-*...

Enclosure in Foreign Office Note No.E.362/260/91 of 23rd January, 1936. COPY (E.362/260/91) PETROLEUiVl CONCESSIONS LlivlITED At the request of sir John Cadnian I had an interview this morning with Mr. Shliros, Chairman of Petroleum Concessions Limited, which is the new Company formed by the Iraq Petroleum Company to acquire and develop concessions in the areas, other than Iraq, within the so called 'Red Line'. 2. Mr. SKliros began by giving me a detailed account of the genesis, activities and objects of the new Company. He told me little or nothing that I did not already know. He explained that one of the main reasons which had led to the formation of the new Company, which only differed from the old one in not having an Iraqi Director on the Board, was that the French authorities had objected to any Company with an Iraqi Director operating in Syria. This is no doubt true, but he admitted that it was also to the obvious advantage of the various groups concerned to keep the Iraqis out of their other activities, in the Gulf and elsewhere. Mr. Skliros then described the activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Qatar, Abu Dhabi and the other Trucial Sheikhdoms, and explained that their policy v/as to secure a series of 5-year options, by which they would obtain permission to carry out exploration for 5 years against a fixed annual payment, retaining an option at the end of that period to conclude a concession on agreed terms. This meant that there need be no further negotiations about the terms of any concession should the Company decide to take up its option. But I gathered that the company was in no particular hurry to develop oil in any of these areas and merely/3^1 di&gt; merely wished to prevent other concerns coming in and developing a nuisance value. 3 . Mr. Skliros added that Petroleum Concessions Limited also hoped to conclude an agreement on similar terms with the Sultan of Muscat, where the prospects were favourable. 4. They might also consider trying for something on the same lines in Turkey, whither he might himself be proceeding in a few months 1 time. The Turks had, hov/ever, made it clear that they would not deal with any mere group of financiers who were taking up a concession to sell it again at a profit. They would only deal with a concern capable of and ready to exploit any oil that might be found. 5. Mr. Skliros then gave me a very depressing account of the failure of the I.P.C. to take up either the Bahrein or the liasa concessions. He explained that the Bahrein concession was originally taken up by the Gulf Oil Company of California, which was then a constituent group of the I.P.C., and which, therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the n Bed Line” Agreement, offered the concession to the I.P.C.&gt; who, however, refused to take it up, not believing that there was any oil in Bahrein. As a result the concession had eventually gone to a rival group, the Standard Oil Company of California, and the I.P.C. were now reduced to trying to obtain a concession f.or themselves at greatly enhanced terms for the small area in Bahrein not covered by the existing concession. 6 . He also explained that Major Longrigg, who had been sent out to Jedda by the I.P.C. at the time of the Hasa negotiations, had obtained from Ibn Baud a clear statement of his terms, i.e. £50,000 gold in a cash payment in advance and a royalty of 4s. gold a ton on any oil eventually won. Mr. Skliros had apparently made a great effort to induce his Board/(Sj&gt; Board to agree to these terms, but they had, in spite of his advice, to the contrary, come to the conclusion that Ibn Saud was merely bargaining, and had instructed Major Longrigg not to rise above £30,000. As a result ohe concession had been lost to the standard Oil company of California and most of the present troubles and difficulties had followed. I entirely agree with Mr. Skliros and concurred in his view that it was most unfortunate that the l.P.C. had lost this opportunity. (Incidentally had the I.P.C. obtained both the Hasa and the Q,atai concessiono we might have avoided all our present trouble aoout the Qatar-Saudi frontier - though I did not, of course, say this to Mr. Skliros). 7. Mr. Skliros then came round to what was ohe main object of his visit ~ the possibility of his Company obtaining an oil concession in the Yemen. I am recording this part of the interview separately (E.342/260/91). (Sd.) G.W. REInDEI. 20th January, 1936,vK P. Z.8856/35- 12th December, 1935- Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your call at the India Office on 23rd October and your letter of 24th October, 1935&gt; regarding the proposals of Petroleum Concessions Ltd., subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, to seek for oil concessions in the Koweit neutral zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein, the Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, and possibly Muscat* The questions raised have been under consideration in consultation with the other Departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I am now to inform you that the proposals are approved on the following conditions and understandings. 2* Bahrein. There is no objection to your Company applying to the Sheikh of Bahrein for a concession on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests; these conditions would be embodied in a separate agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. 5. Muscat. There would be no objection to the Company applying to the Sultan of Muscat for a concession on/ J. 3. Skliros, Esq., Petroleum Concessions Ltd., City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E.C. 2.2. on a similar understanding. 4 . Koweit neutral zone. Application may oe made to the Sheikh of Koweit for an option over his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should, later become possible for the Company go seek a concession from him and King Abdul Aziz jointly* the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government would oe sought before the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and that any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions, embodied in an agreement with His Majesty’s Government (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position 01 the zone), as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 5 . She ikhdoms of the Trucial Coast. The Anglo -Iranian Oil Company are being informed that His Majesty’s Government approve the options already granted to them by the Sheikhs of Has al Khaimah, Sharjah and Dcbai on the following conditions, and on the same conditions there is no objection to the transfer of those options, of any others that may be obtained on the Trucial Coast and approved by His Majesty’s Government to your Company: - (a) that any geologist or employee v/ho visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality. If, however, your Company should make the application of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph of your letter for special permission for Mr. N.E. Baker, an American citizen, to visit areas on the Trucial^ Coast, the question of making an exception in his particular case would be considered in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf;3. ('b) that any exploring or surveying party in their travels would he definitely guided hy the views of the Resident as to where they should go; (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in v/riting (as to which he would he approached hy the British political aithorities) that he would he responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party; (d) that if it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession, the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government to the opening of negotiations would he sought and in the event of its being given, the conditions to he attached to any concession obtained, in order to safeguard Government interests, would he considered and the approval of any actual concession would he subject to acceptance hy the Company of these conditions. 6. The conditions to he embodied in any agreements relative to concessions would he considered in consultation with your Company when the time came, and might vary somewhat according to the locality in which the concession was sought. I am to add that as you are aware, the erection of a refinery or refineries in territory under British influence in the Persian Gulf is one of the prime desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. 7* It is noted that your Company will keep the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed of any negotiations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit the Sultan of Muscat or other rulers.

Yours sincerely, sd, X.OsFovle*I P.Z.7763/35o INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W, l e November 1935 0 / / / / / ■Tk^i oLjl^k^ r I enclose copy of a letter from Mr. J. Skliros, Managing Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, regarding a proposed procedure for acquiring options, and subsequently possible concessions, for oil in certain areas in the Persian Gulf. Certain points in this letter were more fully explained at an interview which I had with Mr. Skliros and Mr. Lefroy of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on 23rd October. The reason for forming a company - Petroleum Concessions, Limited - separate from the Iraq Petroleum Company is, I understood,merely that the latter company has an Iraqi Government director, and it is not considered necessary or desirable that he should participate in undertakings solely concerned with the acquisition of concessions in countries outside Iraq. E.A.Seal, Esq., ADMIRALTY, S.W.l 3/2 3. As regards the Koweit neutral zone ? Petroleum Concessions 5 Limited are aware of the position of deadlock resulting' from Ibn Baud's commitment to the Standard Oil of California, but they think that by the offer of an arrangement to facilitate the marketing of the Bahrein Petroleum Company's production they may obtain the necessary leverage to induce the California Company to relinquish their stranglehold on Ibn Saud's part-interest in the Koweit neutral zone. 4. With reference to the unallotted area of Bahrein, Mr. Lefroy did not think that this would be of value to anyone, but Mr. Skliros was inclined to think that it might be worth while to obtain an option with a view to its examination. So far as I know, we have not entered into commitments with anyone regarding this area, so that it is presumably open to any company which desires to do so to apply to the Sheikh for a concession (subject, of course, to His Majesty's Government's approval). . On the Trucial Coast the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company '(or the D'Arcy Exploration Company) have, as you know, already obtained two-year options, subject to His/3 His Majesty’s Government's approval, at Has al Khaimah x “ \ and. Sharjah? Mr» Lefroy See papers enclosed with India Office ( printed lecters PoZ.5980, dated 2nd \ stated that they have September 1935, and P.Z.7001, dated 3rd ( October 1935, respectively. ^ just obtained a similar option at Debai. They are also in the field for options at Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain. The Anglo- Iranian Oil Company would go forv/ard with their pending negotiations, but any concessions for which they have acquired or may acquire options on the Trucial Coast would be negotiated and taken by Petroleum Concessions, Limited. The reference to the Pirate Coast is a geographical misunderstanding. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, might interest itself in the possibilities of Muscat, where we have not committed ourselves to anyone and the field is consequently open. 7• I stated that certain preliminary conditions to the approval of options on the Trucial Coast (which had been discussed with Fowle during’ his deputation) would be required by His Majesty’s Government, viz.: Vis-a-vis the C ompany ;- (a) that any geologist or employee who visits any of the Trucial Sheikhdoms for the purpose of exploring or surveying the area of the option should be of British nationality^ (b)// ** - 4 - (b) that the exploring party in their travels would be definitely guided by the views of the Resident as to where they should go. Vis- a-vis the Sheik h;- (c) that the Sheikh concerned should give a definite guarantee in writing that he would be responsible for the safety of the exploring or surveying party. I added that another condition to the approval of an option would be that further approval by His Majesty’s Government would be necessary before negotiations for an actual concession were entered into with the Sheikh concerned. 8 . The question of our future policy on the Trucial Coast, which was discussed by the Middle East Committee on 24th September, has, of course, a certain relevance to the question whether in this backward and uncivilised area the acquisition of oil concessions by any company, of whatever nationality, ought to be encouraged or permitted. The result of the meeting’ in regard to general policy was somewhat inconclusive, but there is, I think, nothing in the conclusions, such as they were, to suggest that we ought/the/ - 5 - ougnt to arrive at a definite decision to sterilise the Trucial Coast so far as oil is concerned. Indeed, the trend of the discussion was rather in the opposite direction, and fowle himself, though he is averse from any new pronouncement of general policy, has always taken the view that in regard to oil we can hardly impose an absolute veto on concessions which the Sheikhs may wish to grant, though specially careful conditions to safeguard the interests oi His Majesty's Government and limit our commitments would be necessary. In any case, by stipulating that the actual commencement of negotiations for a concession, apart from the conditions on which it should be granted, will be subject to His Majesty's Government's approval, we shall, so far as is now practicable, ensure that each case is kept open for decision by His Majesty's Government, when the time comes, in the light of considerations of general policy and of the degree of commitment which the grant of any concession would involve. £o Cn tile question of nationality, it will be seen that the national complexion of Petroleum Concessions, Limited, is identical with that of the Iraq Petroleum Company. It was explained to me that Petroleum Concessions, Limited, would probably beget separate companies to exploitthe several areas in which they might be successful in obtaining concessions 9 but that such are the national jealousies on the part of the non-British elements in the Iraq Petroleum Company that there is no chance of such companies being formed on a basis of a larger proportion of British ownership than that in the Iraq Petroleum Company itself» As 9 however, the areas mentioned (apart, possibly, from the Koweit neutral zone) are within the Red Line Agreement, it seems necessary to be content with the Iraq Petroleum Company's proportion of British shareholding, since no British company outside the Iraq Petroleum Company has shown a serious interest in these areas. Holmes has indeed been angling during the last few months for the interest of an all-British group (which however, had no experience of oil concessions), but I have now heard from him that his negotiations have definitely broken down. 10o If the Admiralty and the ether Departments concerned and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf agree, we would propose to inform Petroleum Concessions, Limited, as follows?- (a) On the Trucial Coast, subject to the conditions stated above, His Majesty's Government approve the options already/the/ 7 (S$ already granted by the Sheikhs of Has al Khaimah 5 Sharjah and Debai s and any options that may be granted by other Sheikhs. If it is desired during the currency of an option to enter into negotiations with the Sheikh concerned for a concession 9 the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government will be required before such negotiations are opened. In the event of such approval to the commencement of negotiations being given, the conditions to safeguard Government interests which would have to be attached to any concession obtained would be considered and would have to be accepted by the Company before an actual concession was approved. (b) In Bahrein and Muscat there is no objection to Petroleum Concessions 3 Limited, applying to the rulers concerned, on the understanding that any concession granted would be subject to the conditions considered necessary to safeguard Government interests. (c) As regards the Koweit neutral zone, application may be made to the Sheikh of Kov/eit for an option for his part-interest in the zone, on the understanding that, if it should later become possible for the Company to seek a concession from him and Ibn Saud jointly, the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government would have to be sought beforec^S) - 8 - the Company entered into negotiations with those rulers, and any actual concession eventually granted would be subject to such conditions (which might be of a special character, in view of the peculiar juridical position of the zone) as were considered necessary to safeguard British political interests. 11 0 It will be observed that the Company propose to employ Holmes for the negotiations of actual concessions. Mr. Skliros explained that this proposal was made faute de m ieux . It is of course primarily the business of the Company whom they employ and, subject to Fowle’s views, we do not think that we need make any objection. 12. If Petroleum Concessions Limited should make the application, of which the possibility is foreseen in the penultimate paragraph cf Mr. Skliros's letter, for special permi ssion f or Mr. Baker to visit'.areas on the Trucial Coast, we could consider in consultation with Fowle the question of making 1 an exception in that particular case from the general rule suggested in paragraph 7(a) above. 13. I am sending a similar letter to Kendel and Starling and a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, to Air Vice- Marshal Courtney. We should be grateful if you could let us have/have an early reply as we should like to let Petroleum Concessions Limited have a reply to their enquiry as soon as possible. Ycura sincerely. tS&lt;A.) J. C. WALTON.PSTROLElIii CONCESSIONS LIMITED, CITY-GATE HOUSE, DINSBURY SQUARE, LONDON, E.C.2 24th October 1935. The Under Secretary of State, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l Sir, I have the honour to refer to my conversation yesterday y/ith Mr. J.C.Walton, at which I indicated that, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, my Company, petroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil concessions in the territory known as the Neutral Zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein I sland, the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the pirate Coast to Muscat. Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was registered as a private British Company on the 14th instant; the whole of its shares will be held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director. The concession recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited from the p L uler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Limited, together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty’s Government; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to Petroleum Concessions Limited in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a spe cial / P.Z.7763/352 . special sphere of influence of His Majesty's Government. There will also be transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-lranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Rulers of Ras-el-IChaimah, Sharjah, Dubai and any other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Trucial Coast. The negotiations for the actual concessions will be undertaken by Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and in that connection it is proposed to employ Major Prank Holmes, who is acquainted with Persian Gulf matters and who, uo the best of my belief, can be entrusted to conduct such negotiations with proper observance of the customs of those countries. The terms to be offered will be based on the terms of the Qatar concession with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessions; the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated. The wishes of His Majesty's Government in regard to the employment of British subjects in these areas will be observed, but I foresee possibly applying for special permission for the company's Chief Geologist, Mr.H.E.Baker, an American citizen, to visit these areas to compile a report on their oil potentialities. The Company will comply with any instructions issued by the Resident or his representatives in regard to the movements, and for the protection of Geological reconnaissance parties. I shall be glad to hear whether these xoroposals are agreeable to His Majesty's Government and whether I may have permission to proceed on the ab ovonlines with the co-operation/~'sr 3. co-operation of the Resident in the Persian Gulf &gt; who will be kept iniormed of the negotiations.
