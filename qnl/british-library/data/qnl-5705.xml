India Political Letter, No. 244, dated \oth December 1876. In this letter tlie Government of India reply to the Secretary of State's Despatch, No. 64, dated 29th June last, requesting a final expression of their views on certain points connected with the proposed application of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to Persia. The time has now come, when, so far as this office is concerned, the correspondence on the subject, which has extended over 10 years, should be closed, if possible, by a letter to the Foreign Office embodying the views of the Secretary of State in Council on the general question as well as on certain particular points. Under these circumstances, it will probably be convenient to recapitulate what has passed since 1866, when the subject was first seriously mooted by the Foreign Office. On the 23rd April 1866, Lord Clarendon forwarded to this office, copy of a letter which he had addressed to Mr. Logic, then Judge and Consul- General at Constantinople, instructing him to prepare the draft of an Order in Council to apply to Persia the provisions of the Foreign Juris diction Act. In that letter, the immediate cause of action at the moment was stated to be a representation from Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran as to the insufficient power of control possessed by Her Majesty's ser vants in Persia over British subjects, who might be expected, in con sequence of the opening of the telegraphic communication through that country, to become more numerous than they had been. Mr. Logic's attention was directed to various points, and he was at the same time furnished with a tentative draft order which had been prepared under the supervision of the law officers of the Crown. This draft gave power to the Consular Officer in any port, place, or district; (1) to enforce by fine or imprisonment the observance of the stipulations of our treaties with Persia, and to make and enforce rules and regulations for the conduct of British subjects; (2) to hear civil suits between British subjects as defendants, and Persians or subjects of other powers as plaintiffs, appeal lying to the Consul General; (3) to hear civil suits between British subjects as plaintiffs, and Persians or subjects of other powers as defendants, provided that the defendants agreed, and gave security, to submit to the jurisdiction, appeal lying to the Consul General; (4) to hear civil suits between British subjects, appeal lying to the Consul General in cases not exceeding 1,000 dollars in value, and to Her Majesty's representative in Persia in cases above that value; (5) to conform his decision, as far as practicable, to the principles of the English law as distinguished from its practice; (6) to summon assessors in civil suits ; (7) to enforce his decision against a British subject in a civil suit by distress or imprisonment; (8) to compel the attendance of British subjects as witnessses; (9) to refer cases to arbitration, with the consent of the parties; (10) to try British subjects charged with any crime or offence and, on conviction, to award punish ment up to one month's imprisonment, or 200 dollars fine; (11) in more serious cases to summon assessors, and, on conviction, award punishment up to 12 months' imprisonment, or 1,000 dollars fine, the dissent by the assessors from the judgment or sentence being reported to the Consul- 18858, I. 76, A [5/2 General, who, in such case, might confirm, vary, or remit the sentence; (12) to deport any person twice convicted, either to India or England according to his nationality ; (13) in any more serious case, tried with the aid of assessors, to deport a criminal upon first conviction, cases of deportation to be always reported either to the Government of India or the Foreign Office. The draft further provided for—(14) the revision in criminal cases by the superior Consular authorities of sentences passed by subordinate Officers, when punishment exceeding 20 dollars fine or 10 days' imprison ment had been awarded; (15) for the sending to Constantinople of persons condemned to imprisonment; (1G) for the sending to Constanti nople of British subjects charged with offences, for trial by the Supreme Consular Court there; (17) for settling petty cases of assault; (18) for enforcement of fines and penalties by distress; (19) for the establish ment of rules of practice and the levy of fees in civil suits,—such fees to be paid to the public account in diminution of the public expenditure on account of the Consular establishments in Persia; (20) for the grant of probate and administration to intestate estates ; (21) for the keeping of a register of all British subjects in Persia,—any person refusing or neglecting to be registered not to be entitled to be recognized or pro tected as a British subject in any difficulties or suits in which he might be involved; and (23) for the enforcement by Consular Officers of the Acts relating to seamen and the mercantile marine. The draft order summarized above, was intended to apply to Persia generally, no distinction being drawn between the interior and the littoral. Lord Clarendon requested, however, that the Resident at Bushire might be instructed to communicate his views on the subject to Mr. Logic, and to furnish that gentleman with any advice or sugges tions which might be calculated to facilitate the performance of the duty assigned to him. The papers were at once forwarded to the Government of Bombay for transmission to the Resident in the Persian Gulf (Colonel Pelly), who in a letter to Mr. Logic dated the 3rd * Enclosure to India Political Letter, October 1866,* explained that his charge No, 147, dated 29th July 1870. . /-i i* • i j j txj . i m the Gult mcluded the entire littoral of those waters, and extended to Muscat and Gwadur on the coast of Arabia and Mekran respectively; that the Resident's head quarters were at Bushire, where he would have an Assistant; that another Assistant would be stationed at some point towards the south of the Gulf; and that at Muscat there was a Consul ,and at Gwadur an Assistant Political Agent. Colonel Pelly suggested that the organization of the Court re quired for the Gulf might resemble that obtaining at Constantinople, i.e. a central Court of the Consul-General being fixed at Bushire, the Assistant Resident Consul at Muscat, and the Political Officer at Gwadur might hold local Courts, constituted like the Courts at Smyrna and else where ; he thought it advisable also that the Consul-General should be empowered to invest his Assistant with Vice-Consular powers at Bushire, and that the order should provide for all cases happening at sea within the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. This letter of Colonel Pelly obviously contemplated that the arrange ments for the littoral of the Gulf should be quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia. It was not reported home; indeed, after the Poreign Office letter of April 1866, nothing whatever was heard on the subject from any quarter until February 1870, when the Government „ „ _ . __ , of India* inquired what had been done February 11 ! 870. in the matter, and requested that any proposals regarding jurisdiction in the Persian Gulf might be forwarded to them for an expression of opinion 'before the question was finally decided.Inquiry at the Eoreign Office elicited* that nothing had been done; * V X? • n* oo A \ i Mr - ^ die( i ^ September 1867, 1870 Sn ' P before the proposed Order in Council had been prepared, and the matter had since remained in abeyance. After much intermediate correspondence, to which particular reference is unnecessary, it was arranged that the Order should be prepared by Sir P. Erancis, Judge of the British Consular Court at Constantinople, in communication with Colonel Pelly. Instructions accordingly were . „ , ™ r sen t from the Eoreiffn Office to Sir P. t Enclosure to Foreign Office Letter, p - • TWW 0 u + r l n fp f 1 1 7+1. Afnv I7tli May 1871 xiciiido, ill d JL /bbpatCll f ClclLCU. ± i til IVlay 1871, of which the final paragraph ran as follows :—' In framing any Order on this subject, you will not fail to bear in mind the recital in the preamble of the Eoreign Jurisdiction &lt;c Act, in virtue of which any such Order can alone be issued viz., ' ' Whereas by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other ' c lawful means. Her Majesty hath power and jurisdiction within divers &lt;c ' countries and places out of Iler Majesty's dominions,' and be satisfied ' that by one or other of such means Her Majesty hath power and ' jurisdiction in the country to which the Order applies.' This was the first suggestion of a point which has given rise to much subsequent discussion. In a Despatch, dated 31st May 1871, No. 67, the Government of India were requested to instruct Colonel Pelly to communicate with Sir P. Erancis, and to discuss with that gentleman what Orders in Council were required ' to confer jurisdiction on islands and places in the ' Persian Gulf not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Muscat,' and also ' to take steps, if necessary, to procure the requisite assent from the ' rulers of those territories,' meaning, of course, the rulers of the ' islands and places ' in question. The proceedings in India consequent on the above communication were not reported until early in 1873. In a Despatch dated 24jth January 1873, No. 19, the Government of India set forth their own views on the subject, and also enclosed correspondence which had passed between Sir P. Erancis and Colonel Pelly, between Colonel Pelly and the Bombay Government, and between the Bombay Government and themselves. Erom the enclosures to this letter, it appeared that, so far back as the 27th December 1870, Sir P. Erancis had communicated to Colonel Pelly his views as to the provisions which should be included in the proposed Order; he proposed (1) that Consular Officers in Persia should be invested with the power of hearing certain civil and criminal matters in which British and protected subjects might be interested; (2) that the Resident (or, by his appointment, the Assistant Resident,) at Bushire should likewise hold Court for the administration of justice, including maritime cases; (3) that the other Assistant Residents (and Consular Officers, if any) should possess like authorities ; (4) that there should be appeal, in certain cases, from the Assistant Residents (and Consular Officers, if any,) in the district under the Resident's jurisdiction to the Resident; (5) that in those cases the Court of Einal Appeal should be Bombay; (6) that the Consuls and Yice-Consuls at Tabreez and Resht should likewise have the same judicial powers, and hold Courts of first instance; (7) that at Teheran a Court should be held either by the Minister, or, at his deputation, the Secretary of Legation or Vice- Consul; (8) that from the Courts of Tabreez, Resht, and of the Minister's Deputy at Teheran, appeal should lie to the Minister at Teheran, or to the Supreme Consular Court at Constantinople, or to the Secretary of State; (9) that assessors might occasionally be drawn from foreigners, especially in cases when protected subjects were involved in4 the suit; and (10) that, subject to special orders of Government in par ticular cases, the place for prolonged imprisonment should be either Malta or Bombay. Colonel Pelly* expressed his general concurrence in the above pro posals, but pointed out that, if the • To Sir P. Francis, nth March Order in Council limited its provisions 1 871, page 7, Foreign Office printed ^ p ersian territory, it would, in so far as the jurisdiction of the Residency was concerned, provide for only one littoral of the Persian Gulf, whereas a large number—indeed the majority—of cases arose along the Arab littoral; it would be very desirable that the Order should include all such regions as might be included within the Resident's jurisdiction. Colonel Pelly added that, the interests in those regions being mainly British Indian, and the bulk of British subjects trading or residing in the Gulf being British Indian or connected with India, he was of opinion that the officials of the Residency should remain wholly sub ordinate to the Indian Governments, and that the constitution of the Residency jurisdiction in subordination partly to the Foreign Office, partly to the Indian authorities, would lead to confusion and delays, and occasionally even to conflict in instructions. It may be observed, with reference to these last remarks, that they were not called for by any thing in Sir P. Francis' proposals; on the contrary, that gentleman plainly contemplated that separate, though similar, arrangements should be made for the Gulf and other parts of Persia. In a letter dated the 25th August 1871, addressed to the Government of Bombay, the Government of India requested to be informed, (1) what was the actual practice in the Gulf as regards jurisdiction in cases where British subjects were concerned ; and (2) whether that practice had been found to be attended with any actual ill results. The opinion of the Bombay Government and the Political authorities in the Gulf was also asked on the point to what classes of British subjects the jurisdic tion of the Courts proposed to be established should apply. It seemed to the Governor General in Council that there were ' obvious reasons (s for refraining from seeking to try the crimes committed by, or adjudi- ' cate on the Civil claims preferred by, or against all, without excep- ' tion, of that heterogeneous body of men, who, from their parentage &lt;£ or residence in one or the other of the many British possessions &lt;c scattered over the world, can claim the rights of British subjects under ' circumstances which may render it extremely difficult to ascertain how ' far the claim is well founded.' Unless, therefore, good ground to the contrary were shown, the Governor General in Council considered that the jurisdiction of the Courts should 'be confined to persons born ' of wholly British parentage.' The Bombay Government did not reply to this reference until the 28th October i872. They then stated that when British subjects were defendants the course of proceeding was as follows ;—(1) in Muscat they were dealt with under the Consular jurisdiction enjoyed by the Political Agent under the High Court of Bombay; (2) those in Turkish territory came under the jurisdiction of the Vice-Consul atBussorah; (3) those in the Arab Coast States had not required the exercise of Criminal juris diction ; those in the Persian ports had been dealt with by the Political Resident and his Assistants, both in Criminal and Civil cases, in the exercise of an irregular jurisdiction for which there was no proper authority, and which might at any time be called in question by the parties affected. The existing practice had not, up to that time, been attended with any actual ill results, but, looking to the changing condi tions of society in the regions in question, it would not be prudent to delay placing matters on a sounder basis. The Bombay Government questioned the expediency of limiting the application of the Order to 'persons born of wholly British parentage';5 such a restriction might easily deprive a bond Jide British subject of the protection to which he had a fair claim; it was hard to discover any sound reason for depriving the son of a British father and foicign mother of the protection of the Court, and Government were inclined to believe that extension of the Court's jurisdiction to all I^ritish subjects would not, in practice, be found to be so inconvenient as seemed to be apprehended. In the letter expressing the above views were enclosed various com munications from Colonel Pelly, passages of which may be quoted. In a letter dated 14th December 1871, that Officer wrote It does not seem to me that any change in the designation of my appointment, or that of my Assistants, is necessary ; what seems wanted is that we should be invested with adequate and lawful authority for the discharge of judicial functions devolving on us ; and, secondly, that there should be unity of authority, whether local or controlling ; and, again, my charge is not wholly or principally in Persia, and what is required in respect to this Residency is, authority to treat Civil and Criminal matters which may have place at any point—whether Arabian, or Persian, or Turkish—round the shore line of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman, and whether'these matters may happen as between British subjects, or (as they far more frequently do happen) between a British subject and a native. As regards the range of jurisdiction of the Courts proposed to be established, Colonel Pelly thought* that * Letter dated 4th September matters, whether civil or criminal, in 18T2 - which persons born of foreign parentage were concerned as defendants, should be excluded, ' £ in other words, ' the mere accident of a person of foreign parentage having been born « within British India or other British territory, or the fact of a person e * born of foreign parentage having received letters of Consular protec- ' tion should not entitle that person to the jurisdiction of the Court but persons born of wholly British parentage (strictly so understood), and also persons born of British Indian parentage, should be included. Colonel Pelly further thought that, on grounds of policy and equity, those persons who, although foreigners by parentage, received British protection prior to the Persian treaty of 1857, should also be included ; this class was not numerous and could not be added to under our present treatv relations. On the suggestion that the assent of the rulers of islands and places m the Persian Gulf not subject to Turkey, Persia, or Muscat should be obtained to the exercise of jurisdiction in t Letter dated 30th September their territories. Colonel Pelly wrote as 18 &lt;2 ' followsf :— As at present informed, I beg most respectfully to submit that it is not either necessary or expedient to obtain the assent of the rulers of the territories in question. By usage and sufferance we have long exercised, and do now exercise, every power and jurisdiction in the territories of the above-named trucial Chiefdoms that could be contemplated by the Foreign Jurisdiction Act and Orders in Council framed under its provisions, while to propose a fresh treaty article would appear to the Chiefs supererogatory and might awaken suspicion in their minds, especially at a time when Turkish intrigues have so recently disturbed the Arab Coast line. In all his communications Colonel Pelly strongly urged the advantage of a personal meeting between Sir P. Prancis and himself at Constan tinople. In their letter J forwarding the various papers noticed above, the Government of India expressed their + Dated 24th January 1873, No. v [ ews on the subject at some length. 19 ' After pointing out that in the discussion of the question care must be taken to distinguish between the legal position of the British Government in relation to Poreign Powers, and its position in respect to its own subjects, and stating the object and effect of the Poreign Jurisdiction Act (6 &amp; 7 Viet. cap. 94.), they pro ceeded to define what appeared to them to be the situation as between the British and Persian Governments, as follows :— For a considerable number of years, apparently extending back to the time w T hen the Arab Chiefs were Governors of Bushire, the British Resident at that place has exercised Civil and 18858. BCriminal jurisdiction over a certain area. The nature and legal extent of the Criminal jurisdiction does not appear to be very clearly defined. The Civil jurisdiction, however, seems to embrace (a) all cases between Uritish subjects and protected persons (who may be called British clients) ; (6) all cases in which the same classes are defendants ; (c) all cases between those classes and others (not being Persian subjects), provided the parties consent ; and Ul) if a Persian subject is defendant, and a British subject plaintiff, the case is tried in the Persian Courts, but a Residency Official may be deputed to watch the pro ceedings. In Muscat the exercise of jurisdiction had been provided for by the Order of the Queen in Council, dated 4th November 1867. The relations of the British Government with the various independent potentates of the Gulf were of the same character as those with Persia ; the amount of jurisdiction exercised was, at all events, not less than in Persia. As regarded the Turkish possessions bordering on the Gulf, there existed already throughout Turkey an established system of Consular Jurisdiction under the control of Her Majesty's Ambassdor at Constantinople, with which it might not, perhaps, be possible to interfere; if the existing arrangements did not admit of modifications, then Colonel Polly's advice to establish a single jurisdiction for the whole water and littoral of the Persian and Oman Gulfs must be negatived; otherwise, the advice seemed very sound and of considerable importance to the working of the system. On this state of facts the Government of India thus expressed them selves, para. 11:— We think Colonel Pelly may be advised that the Draft Order to be framed by himself and Sir P. Francis should be carefully expressed, so as not to assume more jurisdiction than is now permitted by the various Foreign Powers ; that it should go to the full undoubted extent of that jurisdiction ; that the Order in Council for Muscat may be taken as a general guide for the new Order ; that, as regards Criminal cases, it may be closely followed to the extent to which our position admits ; that, as regards Civil cases, the jurisdiction assumed in that Order is narrower than is the jurisdiction in Persia and other places, and the new Order must be modified accordingly as to those places; and that the new Order should also expressly modify the Muscat Order in the same way. On the local extent of the Order Ave consider Colonel Pelly right in trying to embrace into one system the territory he mentions, with exception of the Turkish territory, for the reasons already given ; and it would, in our opinion, be advisable to include Muscat, and to modify the Muscat Order accordingly. In fact, the better plan would be to repeal the Miiscat Order entirely. The Government of India considered that the law of British India should govern all Civil cases, the procedure being regulated by the principal Judge. The introduction of Indian Criminal law might possibly be unsuitable to the circumstances of the community; the better p]an would therefore be to follow the Muscat Order in giving the principal Judge (who would probably be the Besident, or Consul General, at Bushire) power to make regulations, and to provide that, except so far as it might be replaced by regulation, the Indian Penal Code should prevail. On the point whether the jurisdiction of the Courts to be established should be confined to persons born of wholly British parentage, or should be extended to British subjects generally, the Government of India wrote as follows:— If this question were now under consideration for the first time, we should be disposed to confine the jurisdiction to certain classes, such as all persons of European extraction, all domiciled in the United Kingdom, and all who are entitled to British protection, such as persons in the service of Government or serving on board British ships. But, considering that the jurisdiction has hitherto extended to all British subjects, and that the Muscat'Order, now five years old, so deals with it. and that no practical mischief has yet been found, we think that there is hardly any case for restricting the personal jurisdiction, even though it is likely henceforth to allect much larger numbers. But we think that the Judges should have a discretion to remit cases to the Courts of this country, when they consider that justice can so be better done. In defining the classes over which jurisdiction was to be exercised, care must be taken not to infringe upon Article XII. of the Treaty of Paris, which limits the number of Persian subjects entitled to pro tection. As regards the nature of the Courts to be constituted, the Govern ment of India were of opinion that much discretion must be left toSir P. Prancis and Colonel Pelly, but they made the following sug gestions :— We would suggest that the arrangement regarding the Persian shores be kept quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia. The latter must be under the Minister at Teheran and the English Foreign Ofliee. The former should be under Colonel Pelly and the Government of India. It Avill, we think, be safer, and less likely to give rise to mis understanding, to give Colonel Pelly the designation of Consul-General or Consul, and his subordinates the designation of Consuls or Vice-Consuls, in addition to the titles of Resident, or Assistant Resident, or Political Agent, as the case may be. Appeals from subordinates in the Gulf should be first to the Resident or Consul-General, and then to Bombay. Appeals from Gwadur should, as in the case of the Muscat Consulate, be to Bombay direct. The general executive control should be with the Government of India, and in this respect we consider that the Muscat Order should be modified. Should a Consul-General be appointed as a Court of Appeal, it is a question for consideration whether the limits placed by the Muscat Order on the power of fine and imprisonment may not be properly enlarged. The Government of India considered it unnecessary and inexpedient to obtain from the independent Chiefs of the Gulf any formal assent to the exercise within their territories of a jurisdiction which had never been questioned. Colonel Pelly, who was at that time engaged with Sir Bartle Frere at Zanzibar, was instructed to proceed to Constantinople, when that duty was over, for the purpose of conferring with Sir Philip Francis, and preparing the draft of an Order in Council; but, owing to his sub- • Letter to Foreign Offlee, loth sequent appointment as Governor July 1873. General s Agent in Rajpootana, the arrangement fell through,* and the duty was entrusted to Sir Arnold Kemball. That gentleman and Sir P. Francis accordingly met, and submitted to the Foreign Office an elaborate Report, dated the 4th September 1873. 1 Before noticing the contents of this Report, it should be mentioned that, in a Letter dated the 24th January 1873, ^o. 20, the Government of India sent home, with their support, a proposal of Colonel Pelly, that a mixed tribunal should be established at Bushire, for the adjudication of cases in which British subjects might be plaintiffs and Persians defendants. As, however, such an arrangement clearly required a new treaty, they suggested that the matter should not enter into the dis cussion of the Order in Council, but that the latter should be so worded that it should adapt itself to any additional jurisdiction which the Persian Government or other Powers might concede. The joint Report of Sir P. Francis and Sir A. Kemball was based on the assumption that Her Majesty was empowered by sufferance, or usage, or under treaty stipulations, to delegate jurisdiction to her re presentatives in Persia and the States and territories bordering on the Persian Gulf. The exercise of Civil jurisdiction, as described in the paragraphs of the India Letter, dated 24th January 1873, which have been quoted, appeared to be fully established as well in the interior of Persia as on the Persian littoral. As regards Criminal jurisdiction based on sufferance and usage, the assumption was that at Bushire the trial as well as the punishment of the offender, being a British or pro tected subject, would be left to the British authorities; and at Tabreez also a case incidentally reported by Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran justified the same view of British jurisdiction, although there was some doubt whether, of right and in practice, trial did not rest with the Persian tribunals, an offender being merely handed over to the Consul for punishment. The facts beiDg as above, the following was the con clusion of the Report as to the form of the Order, so far as related to Persia: — Jn respect to Criminal as well as to Civil jurisdiction, the Turkish Order in Council appears to us to bo well suited to the circumstances of Persia. We believe, at least, that there is nothing in the provisions of the Turkish Order to debar us from usin^ existino- privileges in Persia, or from participating, under 'the most favoured nation' clause, in any privileges that may hereafter be conceded to other Powers in that country. 'The only matters which would appear to affect our recommendation of the Turkish Order relate, firstly, to the proposed exercise of jurisdiction on separate conditions in different parts of Persia, and, secondly, to the propriety or otherwise of conferring Consular Com missions on Her Majesty's Representatives in the Persian Gulf. As regards the first point, raised by the suggestion of the Government of India, that it would he important (1) to establish a single jurisdiction for the whole water and littoral of the Persian and Oman Gulfs, and (2) to keep the arrangements regarding the Persian shores quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia, Sir P. Prancis and Sir A. Kemhall considered that, partly owing to the differing conditions which must influence judicial procedure in the several territories concerned, partly owing to the jealousy shown by Persian officials on all occasions of terri torial delimitation, the establishment of one and the same Order in Council throughout territories subject to the sovereignty of the Shah would be indispensable. If one system of jurisdiction were adopted for all Persia, it might be worthy of consideration whether Indian law and Indian appellate jurisdiction should not rather be extended to the interior of Persia than that the Persian littoral should be subjected to the English law. On the second point, viz., the right pertaining to Her Majesty to nominate Consuls generally in Persia, or in the special case to issue Consular Commissions to Her Majesty's Political Resident and Assistant Residents in the Persian Gulf, the report ran as follows :— The right is presumed to exist on the following grounds :—By the Treaty of Commerce with the Shah of 1841 our right to name Consuls in Persia was limited, but by Article IX. of the Treaty of Peace, signed in Paris in 1857, we are placed in this matter on the footing of the most favoured nation. Our commercial relations with Persia are, therefore, based on the Treaty of Peace concluded between Russia and Persia at Turcomanchi in 1828, and by the Xth Article of that Treaty Russia has the right to appoint Consuls or Consular Agents wherever the interests of commerce may require iheir presence in the Persian dominions. Her Majesty's right so based is, we conclude, perfect and unassailable. If it were deemed open to question, there would remain the alternative proposition that the Political Resident and his Assistants in the Persian Gulf should be vested, in their proper capacities, with the requisite judicial authority. To this proposition, however, unless the alternative be un avoidable, we are disposed to demur. The Resident and his Assistants are accredited not only to the Arab States but to Persia, and are thereby rendered subject to the provisions of our treaties v/ith Persia and subordinate to Her Majesty's Legation at Teheran. In like cases of officers of Her Majesty's Indian Political service being employed beyond Indian limits, the practice has been to confer on such officers Consular Commissions, to wit, at Baghdad, Bussorah, Muscat, and Zanzibar; and these Commissions being honorary only and accessory, and being so declared, need not withdraw the holders in any respect from the authority of Her Majesty's Indian Government. And as in any case the Political Resident and his Assistants would be called upon to exercise notarial and magisterial functions conformably with English law, more notably in respect to the Merchant Seamen's Acts, we share the opinion of the Government of India that 'it would be safer and less likely to give rise to misunderstanding to give to the officers ' in question the designations of Consul-General and Consul, respectively, in addition to the ' titles of Resident, or Assistant Resident, or Political Agent, as the case may be.' In order to relieve the Resident and provide for his necessarily frequent absences, it became a question whether his Assistants should not be vested with co-ordinate jurisdiction, or whether appeal should lie, as of course, from his Assistants to himself. As regards the subject of appeal, the objections to making appeals lie from the Persian littoral to Teheran and a fortiori to Constantinople were obvious. If, then, appeal to the High Court of Bombay were deemed preferable, it would follow that the law of British India, in cluding the Indian Penal Code, should properly govern the provisions of the Orders in Council, both for the Persian littoral and other States bordering the Persian Gulf, not even excepting Turkish Arabia (Koweit), if as regards that province of Turkey the terms of the Ottoman Order could be modified accordingly. The Report continued :— Assuming now that Her Majesty actually enjoys or may acquire rights of jurisdiction in Persia, there is a separate measure relating to Appellate Courts which we desire very earnestly to urge on the notice of Her Majesty's Government, as even preferable to rendering the High Court of Bombay, as herein-before contemplated, a First Court of Appeal, viz., the9 appointment of n Judge or other Judicial Superintendent, having the requisite legal qualifica tions, with some experience in the practice of British Indian law, who should be commis sioned as a Judge of Appeal much in the same manner, and having moreover the same powers of session and circuit as the Judge for Turkey at Constantinople. As the jurisdiction of this officer would embrace Persia, Turkish Arabia, the independent Arab Slates, Muscat, the Mekran coast, and, possibly, Zanzibar, Bushire was a central position from which it could most conveniently be exercised. The territories in the Persian Gulf, other than Persia and the depen dencies of Persia, in which it was desired by Order in Council to legalize British jurisdiction were those situate on the Arabian coast (with adjoin ing islands), between the territory of Muscat on the one hand, and the territory of Koweit on the other, comprising the petty independent States of Has ul Khymah ; Shargah ; Amulgavine ; Egmaun ; Debaie; Aboothabee; Bahrein—islands and dependencies on the main land; Wahabee Ports. The powers and jurisdiction of Her Majesty within these territories resting on sufferance and usage entirely, and being more than co extensive with those exercised in Muscat and Zanzibar, which are in some degree limited by treaty stipulation, the object and effect of the proposed Order for these States should be simply to legalize the judicial acts of British Political and Consular officers, neither to extend nor to limit the exercise of their jurisdiction. The Muscat Order, with modifi cations, would be best suited to the circumstances of the Arab States. The task of effecting these modifications, as well of adapting the Ottoman Order to Persia, might advantageously be entrusted to Mr. P. S. Ueilly, by whom the latter was originally drawn. deferring to the discussions as to the classes of persons subject to British jurisdiction, this matter seemed to Sir P. Francis and Sir A. Kemball rather to be one for supplementary regulation or instruction than for definition in the terms of an Order in Council. The extremest latitude that should be allowed might be hedged by conditions involving registration, the written consent, in doubtful cases, of the person pro tected, or, in the case of a foreigner, the recognition, similarly declared, of the Government to which he might be subject. But a large discretion must necessarily be left to the controlling authority, and Consular officers should also, as recommended by the Government of India, have power to ' remit cases to the Courts of the country when they consider that justice can so be better done;' in other words, to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction in such cases. As regards mixed tribunals, the views of Sir P. Prancis and Sir A. Kemball were expressed as follows, The attainment of the second point (viz., the creation of such tribunals) would furnish an additional argument for making the provisions of the Turkish Order in Council the basis of jurisdiction in Persia, but the discussion of it can hardly be matured without preliminary investigation of the working of the system now obtaining in the dominions of the Porte, and without examining, if it were possible, in association with the Persian Ambassador at Con stantinople, the several Codes (Civil, Criminal, and Commercial) there in operation. It is very desirable, in the opinion of Sir P. Francis, that we should both be entrusted with that duty at Constantinople. The advantages of the proposed measure, not merely in its bearing upon the interests of British subjects, but in educating Persian officials to a right sense of their obligations, and to the just and proper exercise of their functions, can hardly be exaggerated, and receive their best illustration in the effects produced in Turkey. Its success, however, we apprehend, must in the highest degree depend upon the sympathy and support of other foreign Powers havin^ Treaty relations with Persia, more especially Russia, and it would rest with the Government to consider whether and to what extent it might be expedient to invite com bined action in its prosecution. It will be remembered that the establishment of Mixed Tribunals strikes at the root of the the worst features of Mahomedan administration. They would supersede the influence and agency of the religious Courts. They would gradually undermine religious prejudices and obnoxious rules, and remove those anomalies in the the law of evidence and other laws affecting the civil rights of Christians, which are too familiar to need comment, and which •were found to be so pernicious in the administration of justice in Turkey. 18858. CBut the initiation of this measure must necessarily be postponed until the points we have submitted in regard to the principles and structure of the Order for Persia shall have been considered and determined by Her Majesty's Government in England and in India. The report of which the salient points have been noticed above was carefully reviewed by Sir II. Hawlinson who made various remarks and suggestions. Of these last the most important was that, before any Order in Council was passed applying the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to Persia, an attempt should be made to conclude a convention or capitula tion with the Shah's Government defining our rights both as to criminal and civil jurisdiction, and that the desired clauses might, perhaps, be introduced into the new Commercial Treaty which it was in contempla tion to negotiate. Failing such convention. Sir H. Hawlinson did not think the Turkish Order suited to Persia under existing circumstances. On the question of appeal and the law to be applied Sir H. Rawlinson thus expressed himself,— I doubt whether Persia would concede a right of jurisdiction (by special convention) to our Consuls, if such jurisdiction were saddled with a right of appeal to a Foreign Court at Constantinople or Bombay. Nor would it be fair to Persian suitors prosecuting British subjects before a Consular Court in Persia that the defendant, if cast, should have the power of re-opening the suit in Turkey or in India. By far the best arrangement would be to have a special Judge of Appeal for Persia and the Gulf (as in paragraph 21) located in Bushire, but going once a year on circuit to Teheran, Resht, and Tabriz to hear appeals, and I rather think British law would be preferable to the Indian Penal Code, which in many oases defers too much to Mahomedan feelings, as, for instance, in making adultery a misde meanour. In view of the probable employment of a large number of British engineers and artificers in Persia in connexion with the Renter conces sion (since cancelled) the establishment of mixed tribunals for adjudicat ing cases in which British or protected subjects might be claimants seemed to Sir H. Rawlinson to be of great importance, and the proposal would, he thought, be favourably received by the Persian Government. * The Joint Beport, with Sir H. Bawlinson's observations and some ■explanatory remarks by Sir A. Kemball, was referred by the Foreign Office to Mr. Taylour Thomson, Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, whose reply dated 31st December 1873, being, so far as I know, the only expression of opinion on the subject from the person who may be supposed to be most competent to give one, may be quoted at length,— In reply to your Lordship's despatches No. 6 of the 29th October and No. 7 of the 13ih November, marked Consular, I have the honour to offer the following observations,— By Treaty Her Majesty's powers of jurisdiction in Persia are limited to those accorded to the most favoured nation. The most favoured nation in Persia I conceive to be at present Russia; and the powers of jurisdiction accorded to her are specified in Articles VII. and VIII. of the Commercial Treaty of Toorkomanchai. The investigation and settlement of all claims and disputes between Russian subjects are thereby entirely confined to the Legation or to the Consuls of Russia, and are to be decided according to the laws and practice of Russia. The same mode of procedure is to be observed with reference to disputes and claims arising between Russian and other foreign subjects provided the parties consent thereto. So far the subject does not appear to require any remark. But with reference to cases between foreign and Persian subjects, I believe that usage has superseded the terms of the Treaty in question ; for, instead of their being referred, as therein stipulated, to the Hakim, or Governor, for investigation and decision, the course adopted has been, for many years past, to refer for investigation and decision to the respec tive foreign Legation or Consulate cases wherein the foreign subject was the defendant ; and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the capital or his representative in the provinces cases wherein the foreign subject was the plaintiff. If a satisfactory settlement is not obtained by this means, a reference is made—and this is of very frequent occurrence—from the provinces to the capital, where the matter is discussed between the Foreign Legation and the Persian Government. If they cannot agree, the Foreign Representative lays the case before his own Oovernment. It remains with Her Majesty's Government to decide whether the terms of the Treaty or the practice which has for so long a time been established is to form the basis of the Order in Council which it is proposed to apply to Persia. I quite concur in the opinion expressed by Sir Arnold Kemball, that British subjects should not be relinquished to the chances of Persian judicial administration. I am of opinion that the system of British Consular jurisdiction throughout the Shah's dominions should, as a general rule, be subjected to English law, with appeal to Tehran, the only exception being with reference to cases arising on the Persian littoral and islands in11 which British natives of India are alone concerned. Such cases might be better adjudicated by the Resident at Bushire in accordance with British Indian law, with appeal to Bombay. It would be necessary, therefore, to confer Consular and Vice-Consular Commissions on Her Majesty's Resident and on the Assistant Residents in the Persian Gulf, and also to attach to Her Majesty's Legation at Tehran a Legal Consul. A well-selected officer for this appointment avou UI be indispensable to advise Her Majesty's Minister and Consul-General iu deciding cases which could not be satisfactorily settled by the Consular Courts in the pro vinces. He might also be very usefully employed iu occasionally visiting, when necessary, the towns in which native mission Agents reside, such as Meshed, Astrabad, Kermanshah, Hamadan, Ispahan, and Shiran. I think that the Turkish Order in Council would form a suitable basis for the Order in Council proposed for Persia, having in view, however, the limited number of British subjects residing in Persia. For this reason I would not contemplate, at present, the appointment of a Judge, which would necessitate an expensive establishment. As I have above suggested, it would suffice to attach to this Legation a Legal Consular Officer. I beg to express my entire concurrence in the remarks contained in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Report drawn up by Sir Philip Francis and Sir Arnold Kemball, as to the advantages to be derived from the establishment of Mixed Tribunals for the adjudication of cases in which British subjects are plaintiffs and Persian, or other foreigners, defendants. I am of opinion that great inconvenience would arise if an Appellate Court were esta blished at Bushire, as I feel assured that the Persian Government would not consent to cases referred to the capital being decided on appeal in a provincial town. Two points may be noted in regard to Mr. Thomson's despatch: (1) he was entirely silent as to the existing usage in criminal cases; (2) he proposed practically the establishment of different systems for the interior of Persia, and for the littoral of the Gulf,—for the former, English law with appeal to Teheran,—for the latter Indian law with appeal to Eombay. The despatch was referred both to Sir A. Kemball and Sir P. Prancis. Sir A. Kemball* observed that i*^ etter to Foreign Office, 16th March ^| ie v j ews 0 f ]yj; r&gt; Thomson, in regard to the jurisdiction over British subjects seemed to dispense with the necessity of any reference to the Persian Government, and if approved by Her Majesty's Government would admit of the preparation of the proposed Order in Council for Persia without further delay. This Order, being based on the Turkish Order in Council, would contain nothing to debar us either from using existing privileges, or from participating under the most favoured nation clause in any pri vileges that might be conceded to other Foreign Powers in that country. Its effect would be merely to validate the acts of Consular Officers in the exercise of a jurisdiction already pertaining by Treaty to Her Majesty. But with reference to cases between Foreign and Persian subjects, in which a certain jurisdiction though barred by Treaty had been acquired by usage, the difficulties were considerable. The jurisdic tion of Mixed Tribunals could not be limited to cases in which British subjects might be plaintiffs, and Persians, or other Foreigners, defen dants ; ' so one-sided a condition would hardly be acceptable to Persia or to other Foreign States ; the Order in Council, moreover, could not influence the establishment of Mixed Tribunals. These Tribunals must be initiated by the Persian Government, with due notice given to, if not with the concert and consent of, the principal European Powers having Treaty relations with Persia. Sir P. Francis expressed his views on Mr. Thomson's suggestions at considerable length.* Some of his L \ ett ^ iH°4 I oieiSn 0niCC ' Jat( d rema rks are much to the point, and P must be quoted. As regards ' usage ' he thus wrote :— Mr. Thomson, in explaining what is the course of litigious procedure according to the present practice in Persia, where Eurepeans appear as parties, points out that the practice is based upon ' usage,' and not on the stipulations of treaties. According to his statement, the principles in force for the selection of tribunals for suits where foreigners and natives of Persia are parties, present striking anomalies. The application of the rule with which one is familiar in Turkey of actor scquitur forum rei is an evil which is only tolerated in that country because, unfortunately, no better rule or compromise has hitherto been found. In Persia it seems that the same rule is sought to be followed, but upon it is fastened the additional disadvantage of there being, in truth, no 'forum.'12 When, for example, an Englishman is a defendant in Persia, it would seem that the suit is not tried, but is 'referred' to the English Legation or Consulate, and becomes a matter of correspondence, polemical or peaceful, as the case may be; whilst, on the other hand, if the defendant be a native of Persia, the suit is ' referred' for the consideration of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Shah. Such references and considerations do not involve a judicial determination, but are rather provocative of indefinite dis cussion. There is virtually, therefore, no tribunal or forum where suits of the description in question are decided. The above system is admittedly not one established by treaty, but has grown up so as to claim to be termed ' usage ' under the peculiar circumstances of the country. Mr. Thomson observes, 'It remains for Her Majesty's Government to decide whether *' the terms of the treaty or the practice which has been so long established is to form « the basis of the Order in Council.' On this it occurs to me to observe that the reason why the terms of the treaty referred to have not been applied is, that neither the material for forming the tribunals, nor, indeed, the common idea of judicial authority nor prin ciples of justice exist in Persia. Hence, treaties have been abandoned, and an un satisfactory, imperfect, and temporary practice has been substituted, which is called ' usage.' This so-called usage, however, is so difficult to reconcile with reason or connect with principle, that when one comes to speak seriously of basing an Order in Council thereon one is seriously embarrassed. Nevertheless, it would seem that, before an Order in Council can well be framed for the institution of Consular Courts, it will be desirable to define the limits of their jurisdiction, and with this view to understand whether the usages, as above described, are to be be accepted as governing or indicating the practice of Consular Courts in Persia. Thus it must be decided whether Consular Courts are to be instituted as tribunals with entire jurisdiction over all suits which are now submitted by 4 'reference ' and for 'dis cussion ' before the British Consulates and Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. No provision of an Order in Council, I may remark, can assume to create or to affect juris diction which does not already belong to the British authorities. And there is a great difference between the Persian Government submitting a case to discussion or the considera tion of a diplomatic officer and their committing it unreservedly to the positive jurisdiction of a formal foreign tribunal. * * * * If satisfactory Mixed Tribunals could be instituted, which I am now inclined to fear will prove a work of almost insuperable difficulty, the system of Consular Courts in Persia could be assimilated with that in Turkey, and the Consular jurisdiction would be limited, so that in all cases in which a native or a foreigner, whether plaintiff or defendant, are in litigation, the native and not the Consular Tribunal would have jurisdiction. But if satis factory Mixed Tribunals cannot be instituted (and even in Turkey they are the reverse of satisfactory, and Persia, I understand, is in a less favourable condition for administration of justice than is Turkey) it has to be decided what is to become of those cases where Persian subjects are defendants. Probably, Sir P. Prancis suggested, Mr. Heilly would wish to be iu- structed on this point before he commenced his Draft Order, though he might possibly find it feasible to prepare an Order without the question of jurisdiction being finally decided. Sir P. Prancis dissented from Mr. Thomson's view that, except on the littoral of the Gulf, English law should be applied, because (1) litigation in the interior was comparatively trifling, and it was not worth while preparing a system for the smaller number of cases; (2) it would be objectionable to have two systems of law operating in one country; (3) he thought the Indian system, in many respects, better suited to Persia; and (4) though the English law was the one to which he was most habituated, yet, in his opinion, ' neither in its commercial, civil, or ' criminal character was it a system which should be introduced into a ' foreign country or perpetuated in its present shape anywhere.' Sir. P. Prancis attached great importance to the establishment of a Court of Apj^eal at Bushire, to which Mr. Thomson objected. On this point, he wrote,— Mr. Thomson objects that the Persian Government would not consent to causes heard in the capital being referred in appeal to a provincial Court. I think in this there must be some misunderstanding, for the Persian Government would have nothing to say on this subject, unless, indeed, Persian subjects appeared in these causes as plaintiffs or defendants, and this would only occur on the assumption (which I do not yet make)^ that Consular Courts of First Instance will be seized of cases in which Persians were plaintiffs. If, however, it is held that the objections of Mr. Thomson are sound, a Court of Appeal might be instituted at Bushire, for all districts except Teheran. Nor was it suggested that there should be a Court of Appeal at Bushire from Persian mixed commercial tribunals, but from Consular Courts. The Order in Council will not have to deal with the constitution or working of local mixed Courts, a subject which has been in troduced into this discussion only collaterally, and it can make no difference to the PersianGovernment where a dispute between two foreigners shall be finally settled in appeal— whether at Bushire, Teheran, or Bombay. At any rate, a Court of First Appeal at Bushire from Consular Tribunals in the littoral would be, I submit, unobjectionable. A capable Judicial Appeal Court at Bushire would give unity to the proceedings in the Courts below, and would operate as a check as well as a guide to Consular Courts of the littoral in their earlier development. On the ultimate appeal to Bombay it would seem there is unanimity. Sir P. Erancis concluded with some remarks on the general question which indicated a considerable change of opinion on his part. They will not bear abbreviation, and were as follows :— I desire to revert, for one moment, to the general consideration of extra-territorial juris diction in Persia. If we assert throughout Persia privileges in regard to the administration of justice and legal procedure for British subjects, which we think, and no doubt rightly think, would be beneficial both for Persia and Her Majesty's subjects, yet there is an atten dant evil in so doing which results from the favoured nation principle. Any privilege which we claim or exercise will be claimed by other Governments, and the privilege which may fairly be used by us may be abused by others. This was the case in Egypt. I happened to know that natives of that country and the Egyptian Government would have been content to continue the 'extraordinary usages' in jurisdiction if they had been confined to the English Courts. But where seventeen other nationalities claimed, and many of them abused, these privileges, the system became intolerable, and to escape from it much trouble has been and is experienced. It is desirable, therefore, to reflect how far temporary advantages derived from an institu tion of tribunals based upon large extra-territorial pretensions will be a real benefit and of a lasting character in a country like Persia, surrounded as she is by a strong Government, ready to take advantage of any instrument to diminish the authority of the Government, and dis credit her independent and internal power. 1 have, indeed, on reflection, seen some reason to doubt the conclusion I came to with Sir. A. Kemball, Sect. 10 of our Report. We there say—'The establishment of one and the ' same Order in Council throughout territories subject to the sovereignty of the Shah would, ' we think, bo indispensable.' I should now, I think, hesitate to affirm this, and I should rather submit, with deference, whether the applicability of the Order in Council should not be to the ' Persian littoral' only. I think that if the littoral of the Persian Gulf only, at first, should be brought under the the influence of a judicial system based upon the usage, there would be less chance of pro voking discussion and diplomatic disputes upon the judicial rights in question, or of raising the suspicions of the Persian Government. The Report of the Government of India (Sect. 18 of Report), 'to keep the arrangements regarding the Persian Government quite distinct from those in the interior of Persia,' is one which I am inclined now to think is the sounder view r . I am not, however, prepared to agree that it would be desirable by one Order in Council ' to establish a jurisdiction for the whole water and littoral of the Persian and Oman Gulfs.' It seems to me, then, that by excluding the capital and the interior of Persia from the operation of the proppsed Order in Council we might escape from grave questions with the Shah's Government, for probably ' usage' might be assumed as the basis for the littoral, without provoking discussion or raising the question of the institution of new Civil Tribunals. We should also be providing for what are the real wants of British subjects and interests. The experiment would be tried where it could have the best chance of success, and the conditions are most favourable. Moreover, if found successful, it might be developed, supposing the necessity was hereafter. The next stage in the proceedings was the reference of the papers to Mr. Eeilly, who reported on them fully in a Memorandum dated 4th No vember 1874. He was of opinion that, before any Order in Council was made, ' there should be obtained a separate and clear grant of extra- ' territorial jurisdiction to the Queen by the Shah.' Mr. Heilly was led to this conclusion by many considerations, but mainly by doubts as to whether, having regard to our treaty stipulations with Persia, an Order in Council for that country could safely be based on usage, sufferance, and prescription; by the difficulty of determining certain questions of fact; by similar difficulty of deciding which of the nations having treaty relations with Persia was the ' most favoured nation,' the German Treaty of 1873 being in some respects more, in others less, favourable than the B/Ussian Treaty of Turkomanchai; and by the inapplicability to British subjects of the provision of the Russian Treaty as to criminal cases. On this point Mr. lleilly remarked,— It is stipulated that, where a Russian offender is convicted in a Persian Court, he is to be delivered to the Russian Minister or Consul, w r ho is to send him to Russia, there to undergo the punishment imposed by the laws. To say nothing, as regards British subjects, of distance and expense and other considerations, such a stipulation is, in point of English law, nugatory, not merely in this country, but also everywhere beyond the territorial limits of Persia. Nothing less than an express and direct Act of Parliament (and no such Act would ever be 18858. D14 passed,) could give effect to it. (This is not a case to which section 5 of the Foreign Juris diction Act of 1843 would apply.) The section in question gives power to send convicts for execution or imprisonment to a British colony, but the offender must have been con victed before a ' judge, magistrate, or other officer of Her Majesty,' within the country or place where the offence was committed. This is perhaps the most convenient place to state the effect of the Russian and German Treaties with Persia, which cannot be better done than in Mr. Reilly's words. The text of the essential Articles of the Treaties will be found as an appendix to this Note. Pirst, as regards the Russian Treaty, Mr. Reilly says,— 6. The effect of the Treaty of Commerce between Russia and Persia, signed at Turco- manchai, 10th/22nd February 1828 (4o State Papers, 865;, Articles VII. aud VIII., is as follows, (a) Civil suits between Russians are to be submitted exclusively to the examination and decision of the Russian Mission or Consul, according to the laws and customs of the Umpire of Russia. {d) The like is to apply as to questions arising between Russians and other foreigners, in case the parties agree thereto. (c) Civil questions between Russians and Persians are to be carried before the Hakim or Governor, and are not to be examined and decided otherwise than in the presence of a Dragoman of the Russian Mission or Consulate. (d) The last-mentioned cases are not to be re-opened after being once decided, except on notice to the Russian Minister or Consul, and then are to be disposed of in the Supreme Chancellerie of the Shah at Tabriz, or at Tehran, in the presence of a Dragoman of the Russian Mission or Consulate. (e) In case of murder or other crime committed as between Russians, the examination and the decision of the case are to belong exclusively to the Russian Minister or Consul. (f) If a Russian is involved with other foreigners in a criminal proceeding, or is charged with direct culpability, the Persian Tribunals are not to proceed to examination and judgment except in presence of a delegate of the Russian Mission or Consulate j and if there is none such on the spot, the local authorities are to cause the delinquent to be brought to a place where there is a Russian Consul or Agent, the evidence on both sides being collected by the Hakim or Judge of the place, and signed by them, and transmitted in this form to the place of trial. (g) When the accused is duly convicted, and the sentence is pronounced, he is to be delivered to the Russian Minister or Consul, who is to send him to Russia, there to uudergo the punishment imposed by the laws. By the &lt;c most favoured nation' clause of our Treaty of 1857, these stipulations have been regarded as applicable to the British Diplomatic and Consular authorities and British subjects in Persia; but, in one respect, usage has superseded the Treaty. In civil cases between Persians on the one hand, and British (as other foreign) subjects on the other hand, the course adopted is thus stated by Mr. Reilly,—• (a) In the capital these cases are referred for investigation and decision, where the British subject is defendant, to the British Legation ; and, where the British subject is plaintiff, to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. (b) In the provinces, the reference is to the Consul or to the Foreign Minister's repre sentative there, as the case requires; and if a satisfactory settlement is not obtained by this means a reference is made (and this is of very frequent occurrence) from the provinces to the capital, where the matter is discussed between the Legation and the Persian Government. (c) If the British Minister and the Persian Government cannot agree, the British Minister lays the case before his own Government. There remains the German Treaty, which is referred to by Mr. Reilly as follows:— A Treaty of Commerce was signed between the German Empire and Persia at St. Petera- burge on 11th June 1873. Article XIII. of that Treaty provides to this effect:— (a) Civil suits between Germans are to be examined and judged by the German Repre sentatives or Consuls, according to German law, without local authority being allowed to oppose the smallest obstacle or difficulty. (b) Civil questions between Germans and other foreigners are to be judged exclusively by their Agents or Consuls. (c) Civil questions between Germans and Persians are to be tried before the Persian Tribunals ; but they are not to be decided or judged except in the presence and with the intervention of the German Representative or Consul, or his dragoman, the whole (or wholly) according to the laws and customs of the conntry (that is, of Persia).(rf) The last-mentioned cases are not to be reopened, except with the knowledge of the German Representative or Consul, or in his name, in the presence of a Dragoman, and then only before one of the Supreme Courts (' Cours Supremes de Contr61c et de Cassation '), which sit at Tehran, Tauris, or Ispahan. Article XTV. of the same Treaty relates to proceedings in case of the insolvency of a German in Persia, and provides that those proceedings shall not be taken except with the knowledge and by the intervention of the German Representative or Consul. Article XV. makes provisions respecting the property of a German dying in Persia, which, if he has no relatives or partners, is to be delivered to the German Agent or Consul, to be disposed of according to German Law. Article XVI. provides for criminal cases, in which Germans are involved, in Persia being decided according to the mode adopted in Persia with respect to the most favoured nation. This German Treaty thus varies from the Russian Treaty in some particulars of importance ; among others these :— (a) In civil suits between Germans and other foreigners, the jurisdiction of the territorial sovereign is expressly excluded, while this is not so in the Russian Treaty. (b) Civil suits between Germans and Persians (apparently whichever be the nationality of the defendant) are to be determined not only in Persian Tribunals, but also according to the laws and customs of Persia; this not being so expressed in the Russian Treaty, and being, with respect to some classes of cases, at variance with the ordinary rules of private international law. (c) In the last-mentioned cases any revision of a decision is to be made by one of three Supreme Courts named, instead of it being, as in the Russian Treaty, referred to the Supreme Chancellerie of the Shah. (d) The provisions of the German Treaty respecting insolvency and succession to property on death are wanting in the Russian Treaty. O J In respect of the first and last of these variations, the terms of the German Treaty are more favourable to foreigners than those of the Russian Treaty. In respect of the second, the German Treaty (if I have rightly understood it) is on the surface less favourable to foreigners, but the stipulation, perhaps, has some covert object. It cannot, on the one hand, I suppose, have been inserted by inadvertence ; nor, on the other, can it have been intended by the Germans to be taken seriously and to be acted on. In respect of the third variation, the German Treaty may or may not be more favourable to foreigners than the Russian Treaty is ; this would depend mainly on the Supreme Courts referred to being duly established (I am told they are non-existent) and fairly worked. In view of the discrepancies in the Treaties and the other considera tions which have been adverted to, Mr. Heilly, as has been stated, recommended the negotiation of a new Convention with Persia. In regard to the provisions of this Convention he made the following suggestions:— (1.) An effort should be made to retain and legalise the system substituted by usage for the stipulations of the Russian Treaty, but not embodied in the German Treaty, in respect of suits between Persian plaintiffs and British defendants. The usage is in conformity with the principle of private international law, actor scquitur forum rci. A Persian suing a British subject would have to come to the British Court. This is so by Treaty in Morocco. There must, no doubt, have been some peculiar reason why the German Treaty did not keep up the usage. (2.) The Convention should be so framed as to allow, further, of even a Persian defendant voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the British Court, on his obtaining the consent of the competent Persian authority, in accordance with the practice in the British Courts in the Levant (now regulated by Article 81 of the Ottoman Order in Council). (3.) It would, I think, be desirable to establish in Persia, and for this the concurrence of Persia, and consequently a Convention, would be requisite, a Court of Appeal of mixed (Persian and British) nationality, for all civil suits between British and Persian subjects. Indeed if the two foregoing suggestions are embodied in a Convention, the establishment of a Mixed Court of Appeal would almost necessarily follow as part of the Convention. A tribunal of this kind has been recommended for Morocco by the Law Officers (on which point, with others, I refer to my Memorandum on British Extra-territorial Jurisdiction in Morocco, 3rd August 1874). (4.) The authors of the Joint Report (§ 37,) and Sir II. Rawlinson and Mr. Thomson, are all strongly in favour of Mixed Tribunals (meaning tribunals of first instance) being established, after proper preparations and arrangements, for adjudication of that class of mixed suits in which there are British r plaintiifs and Persian defendants. This arrangement could be effected by the same Convention. (The suggestions of the Joint Report add to the case of Persian defendants that of non-British foreigners, defendants; but this is a matter in which Persia is not concerned, and 'in which no further Convention with her would be needed, as by the German Treaty she waives jurisdiction over all foreigners, as among themselves). (5.) The terms of the Convention should be large enough to give validity, as between this country and Persia, to any arrangement whatever that Her Majesty's Government and the Government of India from time to time determine to adopt, whether with respect to judicial organization, or with respect to territorial division, or with respect to the application of any given system of law. For instance, the stipulations should not be limited by any such16 expression as that in Article VIT. of the Russian Treaty, to the effect that civil suits between Russians are to be decided according to the laws and customs of the Empire of Russia. Mr. Reilly dissented from Sir P. Francis' suggestion that the operation of the Order should he limited to the littoral of the Persian Gulf, he thought ' it would he scarcely practicable to carve out a portion of the ' territory of Persia, sever it from the oilier portion hy an imaginary &lt;c line, and organize in it a system of British judicature, leaving the rest ' of the Persian territory in its present condition, that is, in effect, ' unprovided for.' It appeared to him that it would he necessary to comprise in one Order in Council, or in several Orders in Council, the whole of Persia, on some combined and harmonious systems, if not on one single system, and that it would be better to apply British Indian law to the whole of Persia. On the question whether an appeal should be given from the proposed British Courts in Persia to the High Court of Bombay, or an arrange ment for local appeal should be made by the appointment of a judge, Mr. Reilly observed :— (i.) As regards appeals in cases purely between British subjects, Persia must (as Sir A. Kemball has pointed out in his reply) be indifferent, inasmuch as she waives jurisdiction in those cases, both in first instance and in appeal. (ii. &gt; ) Where there are a Persian plaintiff and a British defendant, I agree with Sir H. Rawlinson in thinking that there should be no appeal to Constantinople or to Bombay. The Mixed Court of Appeal suggested would lake these cases. (hi.) The special Judge of Appeal for Persia, proposed in the Joint Report, and approved by Sir H. Rawlinson, seems intended to take appeals in all classes of suits, whether mixed or purely British. But for mixed suits a Mixed Court of Appeal, and not a special British Judge of Appeal, would be best. As regards purely British suits, there would, 1 apprehend, be very great advantage in having an Appellate Court on the spot. Appeals would be easily brought, and the control over the inferior Courts would be effective. The main difficulty, I suppose, would be in the expense. It is possible, however, that this might be got over by the appointment of a judge belonging to the Indian Civil Service, or by some arrangement for the delegation periodically, from the High Court of Bombay, of a judge or high officer of that Court, to visit Persia. Whatever plan, however, were adopted for a local Tribunal of Appeal, I think its decisions could scarcely be made absolutely final. In cases of magnitude or difficulty, a further appeal would probably have to be allowed, and these appeals should, I think, go to Bombay. As regards the Arab States, Mr. Heilly thought that there was a sufficient basis for an Order in Council in usage and sufferance, and that, as in the case of Persia, the Ottoman Order in its latest form should be the model to be followed in its preparation. On the whole question, the following were Mr. Heilly's recommenda tions, as summarized by himself :— (1.) That a uniform system, or combined systems, of judicature for the whole of Persia should be established by Order in Council, with adaptations to the different circumstances of the interior and the littoral. (2.) That the officers exercising the jurisdiction should not necessarily be Consuls. (3.) That in purely British suits there should be an appeal in Persia. (4.) That in purely British suits there should be a final appeal (in proper cases) to the High Court of Bombay. (5.) That in mixed suits, with Persian plaintiffs and British defendants, the British courts should have exclusive jurisdiction in the first instance. (6.) That in mixed suits, with British plaintiffs and Persiau defendants, mixed courts should have jurisdiction in the first instance, but with liberty for a Persian defendant to submit to the British Court. (7.) That for both these classes of mixed suits there should be a Mixed Court of Appeal in Persia. (8.) That British-Indian law, civil and criminal, should be applied throughout. (9.) That any Order in Council should, as regards Persia, be based on a separate and express Convention. (10.) That like provisions, with proper variations, should be applied to the Aral) States by Order in Council, on the basis of usage and sufferance.

In reply,* it was stated that Lord Salisbury concurred with Mr. Reilly in the desirability of laying an *_To Foreign Office, 27th January indisputable basis for the Order in 1875 - Council by the conclusion, if possible, of a Convention ; that his Lordship was also disposed to acquiesce in the chief recommendations put forward by Mr. Heilly, but that he would prefer to reserve any further remarks which the details of the Order mi^ht appear to demand from him on behalf of the Indian Government, until he should have received the draft. To this the Foreign Office answered,f that the substance of the pro posed Order was contained in Mr. t From Foreign Office, loth Feb- Reilly's Report, and that it appeared ruary 1875. ^ D er l)y that it would be im possible for that gentleman to draw out properly the details, until after the Convention had been actually negotiated; before, therefoie, giving anv instructions for preparing the draft of a Convention to be proposed to * the Persian Government, his Lordship would be glad to receive any suggestions which Lord Salisbury might ha\ e to olfei from an Indian point of view in regard to the particular privileges to be stipulated for by Her Majestv's Government. 'Mr. Reiily's Report, with the connected correspondence, was tor- warded to India J with a request for an + To India, No. 16, dated 18th Feb- 0 ar iy expression of the views of that ruary 1875. Government on the subject, and the Foreign Office were informed accordingly. The Government of India replied in Letter ^o. 208, dated -8th October 1875. On the question whether the proposed Order in Council should be based on our present Treaty with Persia, and the present usa^e which prevails in that country, or whether it should be preceded by the conclusion of a new Convention in which our jurisdiction should be clearly set forth, and provision made for the establishment of mixed tribunals, they thought that a new Convention would be advantageous if a proper one could be obtained, and they suggested that if it were decided to negotiate a fresh Commercial Treaty, the necessary clauses might be introduced into it, but that great caution should be used in order to prevent the possibility of -doubt being thrown upon the 'v alidity of the jurisdiction at present exercised on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf. , t tiix* * i-i With regard to the particular privileges to be stipulated lor in trie proposed Convention, the Government of India had little to add to Mr. lleilly's suggestions, but they thought that it should contain an express provision for placing the subjects of Princes and States of India in alliance with Her Majesty and other persons who are entitled to British protection on exactly the same footing with respect to their privileges and their liabilities as the natural-bom subjecis ot .ilLr Majesty, jurisdiction over this class of persons having, b\ usage, been exercised in the Persian Gulf for many years past. It would be con venient to establish some machinery by which persons of this class could be identified as belonging to the class, and the Convention might provide that the fact of an Indian's name (whether he is a subject of the British Crown, or of a Native Prince or ^tate) being inserted in the registered lists, which should be kept by the Persian authorities as well as^at the British Consulate, should be taken to be sufficient evidence of the man's legal position, and should be binding on all parties. ^ It might also be considered whether a division into two classes would not be desirable in Persia as in Turkey. (This last suggestion referred to a proposal which had been made by the Government of India, in view to a solution of the vexed question of the prohibition by the Turkish Government of marriages between British 18858. E18 Indian subjects and Turkish women; the object and effect of the pro posals in that case may be best explained in their own words (India, No. 207, dated 28th October 1875):— In most Asiatic countries there exists abroad and well defined line, resting upon differences of religion, modes of thought, and social habits, between the natives and foreign European residents. This distinction prevents any general intermixture between the two classes. But amongst our Indian subjects there are many who do not possess the distinct character belonging to Europeans in Asiatic countries, or to Christians in Mahomedan countries. We think it would be well to divide our subjects into two classes :—Class I. consisting of such elements as do not readily combine with Asiatic and Mahomedan society, and which, there fore, stand in need of protection and control; and. Class II., of such as do so combine. In the Turkish dominions the important dividing line would be the profession of the Mahomedan religion. If that line is adopted, Class II. would include Mahoraedans, and Class I. all who are not Mahomedans. As for those of our subjects who are Parsees or Hindoos, they are few in number, and do not combine with Mahomedan society, and though in some Asiatic countries they would fall into Class II., in Turkey they would be more properly placed in Class I. We prestime that there is in Turkey some process by which a foreigner may become naturalised; and if a British subject desires to become a Turkish subject, and does so, we conclude that he falls within the provisions of the Statute 33 Vict. cap. XIV., section 6, and ceases to be a British subject. Again, we see no reason why, with regard to the persons comprised within Class II., we should refuse to concede to the Turkish Government the principle that those who are born within the territorial limits of any State are subjects of that State. If children are born and bred in Turkey, and especially if they are bred in the Mahomedan religion, we think they might pass into Turkish society with advantage, both to themselves and to the States concerned. We are, therefore, of opinion that the following proposal might serve as the basis of an arrangement between the two Governments, which would not only be equitable in the interests of both parties, but mutually beneficial :— (a) That any British subject may naturalise himself in Turkey, and that if no formal process now exists for the purpose, one shall be devised, which may, as between British and Turkish authorities, be conclusive evidence of the fact; (b) That Turkish women shall be allowed to marry British subjects comprised within Class II. without previous naturalisation on the part of the latter: (c) That the issue of British subjects comprised within Class II., if born in Turkey, shall be Turkish subjects.) While agreeing in the desirability of a Convention, the Government of India expressed a decided opinion that, in the event of it being deemed inadvisable to open negotiations for one, or give an opportunity for existing usage to be called in question, there was ground for resting the proposed Order in Council on the existing treaty and usage. Their reasons for taking this view were set forth at length in a Minute by Mr. Hobhouse, which dealt with the question exhaustively. Whatever might be ultimately decided they proposed to continue the existing course of practice, unless they received orders to the contrary. The Government of India concurred with Mr. Reilly in thinking that the substantive Civil and Criminal Law to be administered in cases (1) where only British subject were concerned, (2) in which they were defendants, or (3) in which foreigners, not Persians, who consented to our jurisdic tion were defendants, should, as a rule, be the Civil and Criminal Law in force for the time being in British India; but, as regards Criminal Law, they continued of opinion that an absolute provision to that effect was undesirable, and that it would be preferable to invest the principal Judge with the power of making regulations, such regulations not to have legal effect until they should have received the confirmation of the Government of India, which should be the principal controlling authority under the Order in Council in judicial matters. This last suggestion would seem to indicate that the Government of India had in their mind more an Order applicable to the Persian Gulf and the jurisdiction of the Resident at Bushire, an officer of their own, than an Order to be applied to the whole of Persia, and to be worked by officers who, for the most part, are under the control of the Foreign Office. In regard to appeal, the Government of India observed :— Should an appellate tribunal be established, it should be considered to what extent the jurisdiction should be enlai'ged. Clearly, many criminal cases ought to be decided locallywhich it is now necessary to send to Bombay. The difficulty of producing the requisite evidence at the right time renders the original criminal jurisdiction of the Bombay Court very liable to failure, as some recent cases have taught us. In Civil cases we are of opinion that the right of second appeal should be carefully guarded, both by a limit of value and also by the provision'that the question involved should not be one of fact only, at all events, when the lower Courts are agreed. It is difficult at present to say what the limit of value should be; it must necessarily depend on the value to which suits commonly range—a point on which we are f not yet informed. With respect to the locality of the first Appellate Court, it might be directed to sit at Bushire, or any other convenient place in Persia. The Order in Council might leave a discretion on this point to the Government of India. The only other points in the Government of India letter which need be noted are —(1) a suggestion that the British Courts should have power to remit to the tribunals of the country the cognizance of criminal cases when they thought justice would be better done thereby; (2) their opinion that Bassidore and Angaum, in reference to which some question had been raised incidently, being Persian territory, did not need to be specially mentioned in the Order in Council more than other portions of Persian territory; and (3) that they agreed with Mr. Reilly as to the suitability of the Ottoman Order of 12th December 1873 as a model. This letter, with its enclosures, was forwarded to the Foreign Office,* with a suggestion that it should be re- i8T6 TO F0reiSn 0mCe ' :l5th March ferl ' ed t0 Mr - ReiUy for any observations he might have to offer. This suggestion was acted upon, and in a further Memorandum, dated 6th May 1876,t Mr. Reilly made various remarks and Ma T i n 876 0reign 0fhCe 1Ctter ' 30th suggestions. In regard to the keeping of ' ' registered lists by the Persian authorities as well as at the British Consulate, he observed :— It will be important to confine the Convention, as far as may be, to general provisions. A provision making necessary the keeping of registers in any particular mode would almost certainly become embarrassing at some time. There would be great delay and trouble in getting an amendment made. It would not, I should think, be too much to ask Persia to agree that a register kept by the British authorities in their own way should be conclusive. A provision might be admitted for the communication from time to time of a copy of the register to the Persian authorities. It might also be stipulated, in the interest of Persia (and indeed of both parties), that any representation of the Persian authorities respecting the register should be taken into consideration by the British authorities. As to the proposed division into classes, Mr. Beilly requested further information. The observations respecting criminal procedure and the extent of appellate jurisdiction, criminal and civil, would have to be kept in view when the Order in Council came to be settled; the right to have criminal and civil cases carried away out of Persia by appeal should be clearly secured by the Convention in general terms, this being one of the points on which the Russian and German Treaties would have to be supplemented. As regards the proposal that the British Courts should have power to remit certain cases to the local tribunals, Mr. Beilly wrote :— Most probably experience in some class of cases has suggested this arrangement to the Government of India. It is, I think, new in connection with extra-territorial juris diction. It involves a partial abandonment of principle. If adopted it should be carefully guarded. I think the Government of India might be asked to state in what circumstances, and with what safeguards, they contemplate that the proposed power should be exercised. Pinally, after expressing his dissent from the view expressed by Mr. Hobhouse, and adopted by the Government of India, as to the sufficiency of the basis of the civil jurisdiction now exercised on the Persian seaboard, Mr. Heilly remarked that it seemed to him that the matter was ripe for the negotiation of a Convention. It appeared, however, to the Secretary of State in Council that further consideration of certain points was necessary. These were— (1) the question of providing in the Convention for the cases of subjects of Native States in alliance with Her Majesty; (2) the proposed classification of British Indian subjects in Persia; and (3) the proposal to reserve to the British Courts power to remit cases to the Persian tribunals.20 The first point, involving the general question of the position of the Government of India towards the subjects of Native States resident in foreign countries, was known to be regarded by that Government as one of great importance. On several occasions they had stated their view of the position which was, broadly, that as the paramount power in India, they had the right to exercise the same jurisdiction over the subjects of Native States resident in foreign countries as by treaty or usage they might exercise over their own subjects resident in such countries, but that this right, not having been afiirmed by the Imperial legislature, was liable to be disputed either by the persons concerned, or foreign Governments, or our own Courts. To obviate possible inconvenience from this state •Secret Letter, 16th June 1873, of things, they suggested* in 1873 the ;N0, o8 ' introduction into the Imperial Parlia ment of a Bill, of which the second clause should run as follows :— 2. And whereas, under treaties and arrangements between the British Government and the several Princes and States in India in alliance with Her Majesty, such Princes and States are bound to have no connexions or engagements, or communications with foreign powers, and have in fact no such connections or engagements, or communications. And whereas the subjects of such Princes and States are, when residing or being in places without and beyond India, entitled to the protection of the British Government, and do, in fact, receive such protection equally with the Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty. It is hereby enacted as follows,— The Governor General of India in Council shall also have power, at meetings for the purpose of making laws and regulations, to make laws and regulations for all such subjects of such Princes and States residing or being in places without or beyond India. And the Governor General of India in Council may exercise over such subjects, equally with the Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty, all Such powers and jurisdictions as by treaty, capitulation, agreement, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, the Governor General of India in Council has or can exercise in any such place. This suggestion was made with special reference to measures for the more effectual suppression of the slave trade, but it had not been acted upon. As to whether the subjects of Native States should be specifically provided for in the proposed Convention with Persia, much difference of opinion had been expressed here. Exception had been taken to the proposal by some authorities, on the ground that the existing usage was sufficient, that it would be as well not to put forward more new claims than were necessary, and that affirmation of the usage in a Convention might give rise to pretensions on the part of Russia to corresponding privileges in Persia in regard to subjects of Khiva and Bokhara; while other authorities objected, on general grounds, to enlarging the circle within which the British Consular protection could be claimed as of right. On the other hand the very strong represen tations of the Government of India could not be ignored, while it had to be borne in mind that the Convention was intended to supersede ' usage,' and that if its terms did not cover the cases of the subjects of Native States, the omission being deliberate, it would be difficult hereafter in such cases to quote 'usage' when either privileges or penalties were in question ; we could scarcely claim to apply British laws against persons to whom we deliberately refused British protection. On this question, therefore, a further reference to India seemed necessary. The second doubtful point was the proposed division into two classes, in Persia as in Turkey, of British Indians. As has already been stated, the proposal in the case of Turkey had been made with special reference to the marriage question. Such persons were to be divided into two classes, Class I., comprising all not Mahomedans, between whom and Turkish women marriages were to be prohibited; Class II., comprising Mahomedans, to whom such marriages might be permitted. There was a further proposal that the issue of British subjects comprised within Class II., if bom in Turkey, should be Turkish subjects. The basis of the classification was thus the profession of the Mahomedan religion, and was very suitable for the regulation of a social question like marriage, but its applicability in other questions seemed doubtful. It was not21 easy to see why profession of the Mahomedan religion should exclude a British subject from the henefits of British Consular protection which would he extended to Parsees, Hindoos, and heathens generally, or why a Mahomedan, any more than a Hindoo, should be handed over to the tender mercies of the civil and criminal law of Persia. At all events some further explanation was required. The third point, which could not be decided without reference to India, was the proposed remittal of certain cases to the Persian tribunals, under what circumstances and with what safeguards. A despatch * was accordingly addressed to the Government of India, which, after premising that as the ne- No. 64, dated 29th June 1876. gotiation of a new Commercial Treaty with Persia was doubtful, it would be better that that question and the question of Consular jurisdiction should be kept distinct, and that the latter should be made the subject of a separate Convention, went on as follows :— 3. It having been decided to base the Order of the Queen in Council defining those arrangements upon a new convention to be concluded with Persia, and not upon our existing treaty and usage, it is unnecessary now to discuss the question as to how far such treaty and usage authorize the jurisdiction at present exercised by the officers of the Government of India in the Persian Gulf. In the event of failure of the proposed negotiations, the question may hereafter become important. In that case, the arguments set forth by the Hon. Mr. Hobhouse, in his Minute of the 16th October last, will be of great value in its consideration. Meanwhile, it is improbable either that the legality of past proceedings will be called in qtiestion, or that objection will be raised to the continuance, as you propose, of the present course of practice. 4. Before communicating my opinion on the whole question to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, there are certain points upon which I desire to receive an expression of the views of your Government. 5. The Government of your Excellency's predecessor expressed a strong opinion that the new Convention should contain an express provision for placing the subjects of Princes and States of India in alliance with Her Majesty, and other persons who are entitled to British protection, on exactly the same footing with regard to their privileges and liabilities as the natural-born subject of Her Majesty. I entertain some doubts on this point. To raise the question may lead to difficulty in the negotiation of the Convention, while there may, besides, be objections to embodying in a diplomatic document, to which a foreign power is a party, a view of the position of the Government of India towards the subjects of Native States resident abroad, which, though often put forward by that Government, though acted upon in practice, and even recognized to some extent by Orders of the Queen in Council, has uot been sanctioned by any Act of the Imperial Legislature. On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that it may be found difficult hereafter to enforce the jurisdiction over such persons now exercised in the Persian Gulf by usage, if provision for their cases be deliberately omitted from a Convention which is designed to embody all existing treaty and usage rights. I shall be glad to have a full and definite expression of your opinion as to the course which should be followed on this point. 6. In para. 6 of the letter under reply it is suggested for consideration, in accordance with a proposal made in Political Letter, No. 207, dated the 28th October last, on the question of marriages between British Indian subjects and Turkish women, whether, for the purposes of the Convention, natives of India, British subjects or not, might not be divided into two classes, comprising respectively Mahomedans and persons of other creeds. I do not under stand the purpose of this proposal. The classification suggested offered an intelligible basis for an agreement with the Turkish Government on the marriage question in connexion with which it was pi-oposed, but it seems to me inapplicable to the case now under consideration. The effect would apparently be to exclude, to a great extent, British Indian subjects, who may happen to be Mahomedans, from the privileges and penalties pertaining to British Consular protection and jurisdiction, which would be extended to their fellow subjects pro fessing other religions, and to leave them liable to the civil and criminal laAv of Persia. The distinction appears unnecessary, and, without further explanation, I doubt the expediency of making it. 7. Your Excellency in Council will observe that Mr. Reilly expresses some doubts in reference to the suggestion made in para. 11 of your predecessor's letter, that the British Courts to be established in Persia should have power to remit to the tribunals of the country the cognizance of criminal cases where they think justice may be better done thereby. It will be necessary that I should be informed, after you have considered the point, whether you adhere to the suggestion, and, in that case, whether it should be embodied in the Con vention in general terms, or with restrictions defining in what circumstances and with what safeguards the proposed power should be exercised. 8. Upon receipt of your reply to this despatch, I trust that it will be found possible to instruct Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran to open negotiations with the Persian Govern ment without further delay. To this despatch the Government of India have replied in their Letter 18858. F22 No. 244, dated the loth December 1876. Before referring to their views on the general question, it will be convenient to notice their remarks on the points specifically referred to them. First, as regards the position of the subjects of Native States. The Government of India adhere to their often expressed views. They have always held it to be a matter of political importance that such persons, who are often active participants in the slave trade, should be liable to the control of British officers in the Persian Gulf, and it would, in their opinion, be inexpedient to neglect an opportunity of formulating the claim to jurisdiction over them. They do not share the apprehension that to raise the question may lead to difficulty in the negotiation of the Convention, because in point of fact the Resident at Bushire has exercised and still exercises jurisdiction over such clients without question. This exercise of jurisdiction seems to them to be only a reasonable and con venient recognition of two plain facts,—one being that the immediate sovereigns of the great bulk of these clients cannot, by reason of their engagements with us, make any treaty for the benefit of their subjects; and the other being that Her Majesty possesses a paramount authority over those sovereigns, most notably exerciseable in matters of war, peace, and dealing with foreign nations. Nor do they see any ground for anticipating that the Persian Government will refuse to recognize in a formal instrument a jurisdiction which they have never disputed, and which is so completely in accord with the principles on which ex territorial jurisdiction is allowed. The Government of India continue as follows :— 5. The other kind of difficulty suggested by your Lordship relates solely to the exercise •of jurisdiction hy the Governor General in Council, as distinguished from its exercise by the Crown, On' this point we remark that the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 6 &amp; 7 Vict., cap. xciv., is not confined to British subjects, but gives to the Crown, in general terms, the power to hold, exercise, and enjoy 'any power or jurisdiction' acquired by treaty, capitu lation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means, within in any country or place out of Her 'Majesty 's dominions. That power has been exercised by Orders in Council, some of which, such as those for Muscat and Zanzibar, are made to apply expressly to our clients as well as to our subjects. Therefore the principle of making laws for persons who are not British subjects and are not in British territory is established, 6, We hardly see why any greater difficulty should be found in applying this principle to -the Government of India than in applying it to the Crown, We are not seeking to intro duce a principle peculiar to the Government of India and to ^Native States, We do not ask for these powers merely because we are the Government of India and the persons to be o-overned are subjects of Native States, but because the Government of India is the power to whom those persons look for protection, to whom the right of protecting them has been accorded by the Rulers of the country, and by whom, therefore, they ought to be effectually o-overned. To put the same point in other words, we do not found our claim merely as the fogical outcome of the intra-Indian relations between ourselves and Native States, but on the peculiar position in which the subjects of those States find themselves when residing in a foreign country which admits ex -territorial jurisdictions. We make no difference between the subject of a Native State and any other member of the classes who fall under our pro tection and jurisdiction. The true principle will * ' For all persons who by treaty, usage, be found accurately embodied in Clause (b)*, ' or other lawful means, are under the pro- Section 84, as proposed in para, 36 of our Legis- « tection of Her Majesty or of the Governor i at ive Despatch, No. 2, dated 25th February 1876, - General m CMncil .n any Nat,7e SuK or i nsertion in the draft Bill to consolidate and in any other State in Asia or Africa, &amp;c, ^ ^ ^ . ^ ^ ^ of India, That clause does not refer to the subjects of Native States as such, though doubt less most of the persons described as under the protection of Her Majesty, &amp;c,, would be such Natives, . , , , . , • , . . . ^ 7. In point of fact, we only ask that the very principle which is worked by the Crown under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act shall be applied in the way that is most effective for the purpose in hand? The Home Government must come to a decision for each place, whether British subjects and clients there are to be governed from England or India ; but wherever it is decided that they shall be governed from f Legislative Department, No. 9, dated 9th India, then, in order to make the decision October 1873, paras. 5 to 7. effective, the Government of India must have the Legislative Department, No, 2, dated 2oth re q U i 8 ite powers. That is the substance of the P f S 1 DepKnt, 6 No. 58, dated 16th views conveyed in our despatches noted in the Jane 1873, para. 13. margin, t Our opimon has undergone no change, and we cannot give any more definite expression of it. The position is further illustrated by the difficulties which have been felt in connection with the Holkar State Railway.23 Referring to a case quoted by Colonel Prideaux, in which the Govern ment of India, acting executively, ordered the trial of a Seedee, not being a British subject, at Bassidore, 'which is foreign territory,' and caused him, when convicted, to be transported to the Andamans, they observe :— The risks involved in such procedure are obvious. The case indeed clearly illustrates the difficulty of having executive powers beyond the area of legislation. And we can only be freed from that difficulty by the action of Parliament, as the Crown has been freed. For the petty offences tried and punished on the spot it matters comparatively little what arrangement is made. The chances of failure will occur in those cases in which failure is most embarrassing,—those cases, namely, which are of sufficient importance to be sent to Bombay, either originally or on appeal. And we feel so strongly that there will be failure unless the Government of India can make, as well as administer, law, that we have no hesitation in advising your Lordship that, unless Her Majesty's Government are in a position to procure for us adequate powers, the safer course will be to keep the whole jurisdiction in Persia directly under the Crown. On this it may be observed that it seems, on the whole, scarcely necessary to import into the discussion of the question whether, in a particular Order in Council, provision shall be made for the subjects of Native States resident in the country affected by the Order, the much larger question of the propriety or otherwise of vesting the Governor General in Council with power to legislate generally for the subjects of protected States resident abroad. It is the less necessary, as the im mediate question appears, in fact, to have been settled by the Act (39 &amp; 40 Vict., cap. 46) passed last Session, &lt;c for more effectually ' punishing Offences against the Laws relating to the Slave Trade.' Not only is it stated in the third paragraph of the preamble to that Act that— The several Princes and States in India in alliance with Her Majesty have no con nections, engagements, or communications with Foreign Powers, and the subjects of such Princes and States are, when residing or being in the places herein-after referred to, entitled to the protection of the British Government, and receive such protection equally with the subjects of Her Majesty, but Clause IV. provides as follows :— 4. And whereas by certain Orders of Her Majesty in Council made by virtue ot an Act made and passed in the session of Parliament holden in the sixth and seventh years of Her Majesty's reign, chapter ninety-four, which Orders are dated respectively the ninth August one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six and the fourth November one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, it is ordered that the provisions of such Orders relating to British subjects shall extend and apply to all subjects of Her Majesty, whether by birth or by naturalisation, and also to all persons enjoying Her Majesty's protection in the several dominions mentioned in such Orders respectively. It is hereby declared and enacted that for the purposes of the said Orders in Council, and of any Orders in Council which Her Majesty may hereafter think fit to make by virtue of the said Act of the sixth and seventh years of Her Majesty's reign, chapter ninety-four, all subjects of the several Princes and States in India in alliance with Her Majesty, residing and being in the several dominions comprised in such Orders respectively, are and shall be deemed to be persons enjoying Her Majesty's protection therein. The Orders specified in the first paragraph of the above clause are those applying the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to Zanzibar and Muscat, but the provision in the enacting paragraph appears to be perfectly general. If it is to be so construed, any Order in Council applying the Foreign Jurisdiction Act to Persia, and making provision (as it would make) for ' persons enjoying Her Majesty's protection ' in Persia, would necessarily apply to the subjects of protected Native States, and in a Convention with Persia no specific reference to the latter class of persons would be necessary. As regards the proposed classification of British Indian subjects in Persia, the Government of India write,— We apprehend that there is some misunderstanding as to the intention of the Government of India in recommending such a classification. It was not meant that British Indian subjects entered in Class II. (i.e., mainly Mahomedans,) should be removed from the protection and control of our Consular Officers. According to our views this result should ensue in either of two contingencies,— (a) If the person were naturalized by some process recognized in Persia. (5) If the person were born in Persia and were the child of a British Indian subject entered in Class II.24 11. Tt is true that the difliculty about intermarriages, which led to our intervention of this plan for Turkey, has not arisen in Persia. But the other reasons assigned by us for allowing persons born in a countiy to tali easily into the society of that country, apply as strongly to Persia as to Turkey. We will restate them here,— (a) Any Government may reasonably object to the growth of an alien community pos sessing exceptional privileges within its confines. (A) Children of Asiatics born and bred in Persia, especially if bred in the Mussulman religion, are likely to combine easily with the society of their native country, and in this case we may well concede to the Persian Government the principle that those who are born within the territorial limits of a State are subjects of that State. (c) It is to our own interest to get rid of the trouble and the embarrassment caused by the existence of protected communities in foreign countries, and we should contract not extend them, so far as is consistent with our duty as rulers. (cT) It is consistent with our duty as rulers to adopt this policy when those who might be claimed as our subjects, by birth and religion combined, readily intermingle with the people of the country. 12. If, therefore, the exclusion of Persian-born children of Class II. from the circle of our subjects be likely to avoid complications with the Shah's Government, advantageous to our selves, and justifiable on the ground that such persons blend readily with their co-religionists in the country, it appears to follow that the proposal to exclude them is not inapplicable to the case, but, on the contrary, is calculated to facilitate the course of the negotiations. From the terms of the original India letter on the subject, which have been quoted (page 18), it will he seen that in the case of Turkey the proposal distinctly was that marriage with Turkish women should be allowed to Mahomedans and prohibited to others, and that the children, not merely of Mahomedans married to Turkish women, but of Mahome- dans generally, should, if born in Turkey, be Turkish subjects. In the letter on the subject of consular jurisdiction in Persia, it was suggested that, for the purpose of determining the right of an Indian to'receive British protection in that country, ' a division into two classes might be ' desirable in Persia as in Turkey. ' This was naturally understood to mean that Mahomedans should be excluded from such protection. It now appears that this conclusion was erroneous, and that the suggestion was intended to be that Mahomedan British subjects in Persia should receive protection, but that their children born in Persia should not, and that we should ' concede to the Persian Government the principle that those who &lt;c are born within the territorial limits of a State are subiects of that ' State.' Any discussion of the policy of such a concession of principle would be alike beyond my province and my competence. I am not informed whether it has been decided to make it to Turkey; if so, the precedent would probably be followed in the case of Persia; but, adverting to the view of the Government of India that Persian-born children of the suggested Class II. 'blend readily with their co-religionists in the ' country,' it is perhaps not irrelevant to observe that what may be true of Turkey is not necessarily true of Persia. The majority of our Mahomedan Indian subjects are, like the majority of the Turkish Ma homedans, Soonis; the majority of Persians are Shiahs; therefore, if, as I believe is the case, the feelings with which the members of the two sects regard one another is not very different from that with which Christians in some countries regard Jews, and various sects of Ciiristians in most countries regarded each other not so very long ago, the blending spoken of by the Government of India, though probable in Turkey, cannot be regarded as by any means so probable in Persia. The third point referred to the Government of India was, the desira bility or otherwise of reserving power to the British Courts to remit cases to the local tribunals. This seems to them a desirable practice to allow, but they hardly think it expedient to stipulate it in the Conven tion. They observe,— It is not likely that the Persians will refuse to investigate cases remitted to them, and we might find a difficulty in binding them to adjudicate without inconveniently bindino- ourselves to refer. 0 17. The Order in Council should empower the British Courts to remit such cases, and the authority should, we think, be given in wide and general terms. Probably it would be quite sufficient to qualify the case admitting of reference as ' cases which from their petty and25 ' simple nature, or from the social position of the parties, are, in the opinion of the Courts proper to be decided by the Persian authorities.' If, however, it is thought necessary to lay down more definite limits, and if the double classification should be adopted, it would afford a convenient dividing line, and the power might be confined to cases affecting the members of Class II. 18. This being done we can issue executive instructions for the guidance of our officers in the exercise of the discretion granted them, according as experience may show the need of instructions. Speaking generally, the principal points which our officers would have to bear in mind would be, that justice is more likely to be secured by referring the case than by retaining it, and that there is no fear of barbarous punishments being inflicted. In their letter the Government of India enclose two papers which may now he noticed. These are (1) a letter from Colonel Ross, the Resident in the Gulf, dated 11th April 1876, submitting a summary of cases dis posed of under his orders during the years 1873, 1874, 1875, and (2) a letter from Colonel Prideaux, who is at present officiating for Colonel Ross, dated 22nd June 1876, giving his views on the general question and making various suggestions. The list enclosed in Colonel Ross' letter is described as ce general list of ' cases. Civil and Criminal, adjudicated or investigated by the Resident, ' Persian Gulf, and his Assistants, during the three years ending 31st ' December 1875 ' and, very properly, includes every question or com plaint referred to the Residency; but, so far as the 246 Bushire cases are concerned, the great majority are of the most trivial character, and very many have really no claim to be classed as civil or criminal cases at all. I abstain from quoting particular instances, in order not to appear to treat lightly a serious subject, but I would beg to refer to Nos. 45, 55, 71, 95, 105, 126, 133, 154, 191, 195, 218, 231, on the Bushire list. It is impossible, without a smile, to picture an officer in the position of Resi dent in the Gulf dealing with many of these cases, either judicially or politically. Colonel Prideaux's letter states very clearly the present position of affairs on the Persian littoral of the Gulf. According to him, no doubt exists ' as to the enjoyment of full jurisdiction by Her Majesty ' over (1) European British subjects, (2) Indian British subjects, including the subjects of Native States, and (3) Persian-born subjects who were in the enjoyment of British protection prior to the date of the Treaty of Paris, in all cases between themselves, or in which Persians are claimants,— except in disputes with respect to real property, which it has been the practice to have determined by the religious Law Courts, presided over by the Chief Moojtahed, even though the plaintiff and defendant may both be hond fide British subjects. The origin and object of this partial abandonment of a Treaty right does not appear. Colonel Prideaux repeats, what has been stated before in various places, as to the want of validity of the jurisdiction which has been exercised, as against our own subjects : ' Whatever jurisdiction Her &lt;c Majesty may possess in a foreign country must, in order to be exer- ' cised effectively, be delegated to certain officers. No such delegation ' by special instrument has ever taken place in the case of Her Majesty's ' representatives in the Persian Gulf, and it is in consequence of the ' omission of this formality that so many doubts have of late years been Cf raised with regard to the jurisdiction of the Resident at Bushire. The ' question has not been with respect to the possession of jurisdiction by ' Her Majesty as against the Persian Government, but with respect to ' the exercise of that jurisdiction over British subjects by officers who ' have not been specially delegated ad hoc under the provisions of the ' Poreign Jurisdiction Act.' No system of registration of British or protected subjects is carried out; none of the machinery of a Court of Law exists at Bushire; no summonses or warrants are ever issued, nor arc decrees reduced to formal writing; witnesses are very seldom orally examined, and evidence is never taken on oath, but on solemn affirmation. It does not appear that objection has ever been taken to the procedure in vogue, but this, in 18858. GColonel Prideaux's opinion, is because the Resident lias always acted in the spirit of an arbitrator, rather than of a judge. ' Execution seems ' never to have been levied either on person or property in satisfaction ' of a decree, whilst conciliation has been pushed to its utmost length ' under the impression which has prevailed for many years that the ' E-esident has no power to enforce his orders in these cases.' As regards criminal cases Colonel Prideaux writes as follows:— I cannot find recorded any criminal proceedings of at all a serious nature against an European British subject. The Government of India has no power to legislate for European British subjects in Persia, and it would seem to follow that the Resident, who is appointed by the Government oflndia, and holds no commission from the Queen, is equally devoid of jurisdiction. At any rate, the Residency can adduce no precedents on which to establish usage. The status of European subjects constitutes a real difficulty, and unless there is an English statute corresponding with the repealed Indian Act I. of 1849, there seems no via media between allowing an Englishman accused of a serious offence to go scot-free, or waiving our extra-territorial jurisdiction in his case and handing him over to the local authorities for trial. If the Resident cannot deal with the case himself, he certainly has not at present power to remit it to a British tribunal under section 4 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. This difficulty does not exist in the case of British Indian subjects. Under Act I. of 1849, all native subjects of the British Government committing criminal offences beyond the limits of the British provinces were amenable to the law for all such offences as if they had been committed within the British territories. * * * * Act I. of 1849 was repealed by Act XI. of 1872 (The Foreign Jurisdiction and Extradition Act, 1872), and in exercise of the powers conferred by that Act, the Governor General in Council, by a Notification No. 127.'5P., dated 18th June 1873, appointed the Resident in the Persian Gulf to be a Justice of the Peace within the territories in whieh he was accredited as representative of the British Government. The Resident enjoys, therefore, in respect to the native Indian subjects of Her Majesty, all the powers conferred on Magistrates of the first class who are Justices of the Peace and European British subjects, by any law for the time being in force in British India relating to criminal procedure. The Governor General in Council has also directed that committals in serious cases should be made to the High Court of Bombay, and if this Residency were only concerned with British Indian subjects, nothing in regard to criminal procedure would be required beyond this Notification. The preamble of the Indian Act XI. of 1872, quoted by Colonel Prideaux, is based on the model of the English Foreign Jurisdiction Act. The Act extends to the whole of British India, to all Native Indian subjects of Her Majesty without and beyond the Indian territories under the dominion of Her Majesty, and to all European British subjects within the dominions of Princes and States in India in alliance with Her Majesty. It does not, therefore, apply either to European British subjects, or the subjects of Native States, resident outside India. The clauses which relate to the powers of British Officers in places beyond British India are the following :— 4. The Governor General in Council may exercise any power or jurisdiction which the Governor General in Council now has, or may at Exercise of powers of Governor General in au y t;i rae hereafter have, within any country or place hereof* 6701 ' 1 ^ delegatl0n beyond the limits of British India, and may dele gate the same to any servant of the British Indian Government, in such manner and to suclvextent as to the Governor General in Council from time to time seems fit. 5. A notification in the ' Gazette oflndia' of the exercise by the Governor General in Council of any such power or jurisdiction, and of Notification of^ensise or delegation of such the flelegat;on thereof by him to any person or prnVLrs ' class of persons, and of the rules of procedure or other conditions to which such persons are to conform, and of the local area within which their powers are to be exercised, shall be conclusive proof in any Court of the truth of the matters stated in the notification. 6. The Governor General in Council may appoint any European British subject, either . . . . by name or by virtue of his office, in any such Appointment, peers, and jnnsd.ction of „ )UIl| , , 0 ) x . J ust i ce 0 f the Pence ; and C' of''- every such .Testiee of the Pence shall have all the powers conferred on Magistrates of the first class who are Justices of the Peace and European British subjects, by any law for the time being in force in British India relating to Criminal Procedure. The Governor General in Council may direct to what Court having jurisdiction over European British subjects any such Justice of the Peace is to commit for trial. 4. All Political Agents and all Justices of the Peace heretofore appointed by the Governor „ „ . „ . . General in Council, or the Governor in Council of and jSef ° tiie Residency of Fort St, George or Bombay, in any such country or place as aforesaid, shall be27 deemed to be and to have been appointed, and to have and to have had jurisdiction, under the provisions of this Act. 8. The law relating to offences and to Criminal Procedure for the time being in force in. British India, shall, subject as to procedure to Extension of criminal law of British India gu^ modifications as the Governor General in to British subjects in i ative tates. Council from time to time directs, extend to all British subjects, European and Native, in Native States. The only other point in Colonel Prideaux's letter which need he mentioned ^ is his suggestion that if it he deeided to constitute the President at Bushire a Consul General, it would perhaps he conyenient if he were commissioned hy Her Majesty as Consul General for the provinee of Pars and its dependencies. It remains to refer to some observations made hy the Government of India in their letter on the general question of the jurisdiction at present exercised hy their officers in the Gulf. They write ;— 3. As regards the jurisdiction exercised by our officers on the Persian littoral, we note that Her Majesty's Government have agreed to our orders directing the old practice to be continued. In the case of the Hindu convert to Islam at Kerraan, the British Minister at the Court of the Shah has received instructions to act on the theory that the jurisdiction exists. Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, in the report which accompanies this despatch, con firms our impressions that, at least in respect to our own subjects and clients, the Persians never dispute the jurisdiction. The list of cases submitted by Lieutenant-Colonel Ross shows that the greater part of such cases are settled one way -or another, and that those which are mentioned by Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux as lingering till the parties are ex hausted, a result not unknown under more regular systems, cannot be very many. In short, the jurisdiction appears, with all its defects, to have a substantial and an useful existence, and to be quite capable of sustaining an Order in Council, supposing that the negotiation for a Convention fails, or is very long protracted. We invite your Lordship's attention to this point, and especially to paragraph 6 of the letter of Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, in which ho states that the weak point is not lack of jurisdiction in the Crown, but lack of authority in the officers by whom such jurisdiction is exercised. This defect would be remedied at once by an Order in Council. The ahove remarks, read in connection with previous observations to the same effect, indicate, I think, that the Government of India are inclined to doubt both the expediency of opening negotiations with the Government of Persia on so delicate a subject, and the necessity for setting in motion the elaborate machinery which has been suggested, so far, at any rate, as the Persian Gulf is concerned. Before, there fore, proposing to the Poreign Office that Mr. Taylour Thomson should be* Instructed to address the Persian Government in view to the con clusion of a Convention which may allow practical effect to be given to what may be called Mr. Heilly's scheme, the Secretary of State mav be disposed to reconsider the whole question, and to determine whether the more prudent course, and the one which would really meet the necessities of the case from an Indian point of view, would not be to revert to the original proposals of * Letter No. 19, dated 24th June Government of India,* (1) that the 18 ' 3 ' draft Order 'should be carefully ex- pressed so as not to assume more jurisdiction than is now permitted,' but should &lt;c go to the full extent of that jurisdictionand (2) that the arrangements regarding the Persian shores should he kept quite distinct from those for the interior of Persia. It will, perhaps, be most convenient to take the second point first. On going carefully through the papers, it will be seen that the view of the Government of India is, in fact, shared by competent judges. It is true that Sir P. Erancis and Sir A. Kemball in their joint report expressed themselves in an opposite sense, but the former gentleman, for reasons which have been set out at length (see p. 13), subsequently changed his opinion. Mr. Taylour Thomson, too, recommended that on the Persian littoral and islands a different system of law should be applied in cases in which British natives of India were alone concerned, to that which should be applied in other cases and in the interior, and that appeal in such cases should lie to a different authority, viz., to Bombay instead of to Teheran. On the other hand, Mr. Reilly, adverting specially to Sir P. Prancis' final view, is of opinion that ' it would be28 ' scarcely practicable to carve out a portion of the territory of Persia, ' sever it from the other portion by an imaginary line, and organize in ' it a system of British judicature, leaving the rest of the Persian ' territory in its present condition, that is, in effect, unprovided for.' Mr. Eeilly's authority on such a subject is of course very weighty, and criticism of his opinions savours of presumption ; but I would venture to submit that the difficulty in the way of adopting the course to which he takes exception is more theoretic than practical. If the necessities and circumstances of the Persian shores differ—as they do differ—from those of the interior of Persia, why should measures which are necessary and suitable for the littoral be simultaneously extended, for the mere sake of uniformity, to other parts of a widely extended kingdom, where the necessity for them is, at any rate, not so urgent, and where they may not be suitable ? Is there not much force in Sir P. Francis' view that an experiment should be tried where it has the best chance of success, and the conditions are most favourable, its development else where being left ^or the future, after experience has been gathered of its working ? The objections, too, which might be advanced to ' carving ' out ' a portion of Persian territory, in order to establish therein an extended system of extra-territorial jurisdiction, will not apply, should this intention be abandoned, and it be decided, for the present at least, to take only the formal steps which may be requisite to place on a legal basis the jurisdiction which is now exercised by British officers on the Persian shores of the Gulf with the assent of the Persian Government, but without authority from the British Crown. The same steps might of course be taken in regard to the interior of Persia; that is a matter for the decision of the Foreign Office. What is important to Indian interests is, that action in reference to the Gulf should not be unne cessarily delayed, while discussion is prolonged as to whether any and what measures shall be adopted in respect to the interior. Then as to the extent of the jurisdiction to be provided for by the Order in Council, assuming that the application of the Order will, for the present, be limited to the Persian littoral of the Gulf. I leave out of consideration the separate Order which will be necessary for the Arab coast,—as to that no difficulty has been suggested. Admitting to the fullest extent the force of Mr. Reilly's arguments in favour of obtaining from the Shah ' a separate and clear grant of extra-territorial jurisdic- ' tion to the Queen,' before any Order in Council is issued, 1 submit that the view taken by the Government of India that such a measure is not indispensable, is correct, provided that the scope of the Order be limited. To meet the requirements of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act it is only necessary that c&lt; by Treaty, Capitulation, Grant, Usage, Sufferance, ' and other lawful means ' the queen should have acquired 'power and ' jurisdiction ' on the .Persian shores of the Gulf. It cannot be doubted that in one or other of the ways specified the Queen has acquired such power and jurisdiction to a certain extent, and may, therefore, to the same extent, delegate her authority to her officers in the Gulf. But if it be desired to enlarge the jurisdiction which has, in one way or another, been acquired, and to establish a system of procedure which is outside both the terms and spirit of any Treaty of which we have the benefit, and in favour of which no usage can be quoted, a fresh Convention with Persia is indispensable. It is, no doubt, theoretically, very desirable to provide authoritatively for the disposal of suits between British subjects and Persians (whether the latter appear as plaintiffs or defendants), by means of mixed tribunals or otherwise; but apart from the question whether any satisfactory mixed tribunal would be likely to be set up in Persia, as to which persons most competent to speak of the Persian character are sceptical, it appears very doubtful if the advantage to be gained is sufficiently great to justify the commencement of a negotiation which would cer tainly be lengthy, could not fail to raise difficult and delicate questions,29 affecting not only our relations, but those of other countries, with Persia, might he made an excuse for troublesome counter-claims and pretensions on her part, and, after all, might prove abortive. Our experience of diplomatic efforts in Persia of late years has not been encouraging. It may assist to a decision of the point under consideration to once more state concisely the extent of the jurisdiction now enjoyed in the Gulf, or which may clearly be claimed under Treaty, and the provisions to regulate the exercise of that jurisdiction which might be embodied in any Order in Council without giving rise to questions with the Persian Government. Pirst, as to Civil cases. 'We have jurisdiction, original and appellate, (1) in all cases in which British or protected subjects are concerned as between themselves; and (2) in all cases in which those classes are concerned with foreigners, not Persians, and the foreigners consent to the jurisdiction. We have original jurisdiction in all cases in which British and protected subjects are concerned as defendants with Persian plaintiffs. In criminal cases we have absolute jurisdiction when the matter is between British subjects and proteges. In other cases, by Article VIII. of the Russian Treaty, the trial of an offender rests with the Persian tribunals, his punishment with us; but, at Bushire, there are grounds for assuming that trial as well as punishment, the prosecutor Ijeing a Persian subject, would be left to the British authorities. It may also be presumed that a similar course would be pursued when a foreigner (not Persian) was prosecutor. It follows, then, that an Order in Council intended to regulate the exercise of a jurisdiction, which, on the Persian shores of the Gulf, is either now enjoyed or may be claimed, might provide for the disposal (1) in first instance and on appeal, of all civil cases between British subjects and persons under British protection, including the subjects of Native States ; (2) in first instance, of all cases between the same classes as defendants and Persians as plaintiffs; the arrangements as to appeal could not be compulsory in these cases, the Russian Treaty providing that, after being once decided, they shall not be re-opened except in a particular way, but probably the British Court of Appeal, whether at Bushire or Bombay, might be made available to the parties if they thought proper to avail themselves of it; (3) in first instance, and on appeal, of all cases between the same classes and foreigners (not Persians) provided that the foreigners consented to resort to the British Courts; (3) of all cases between the same classes as plaintiffs and Persians as defendants, provided that the Persian defendants accepted the jurisdic tion of the British Courts, and the Persian authorities raised no objection ; otherwise, such cases would have to be disposed of, as at present, by the Persian Courts, under the supervision of an official from the Besidency; (5) of all criminal cases in which British subjects or protected persons may be defendants; a criminal case in which a British subject might be prosecutor could not, apparently, be dealt with by the British tribunals, except at the expressed wish of the Persian authorities, who would probably not pay much regard to the wishes of the offender in the matter. Although an Order embodying the above provisions would, no doubt, be a much less complete instrument than the Order sketched out in the Joint Keport of Sir P. Erancis and Sir A. Kemball, and in Mr. Beilly's memoranda, yet it would go a long way towards putting judicial affairs at Bushire and elsewhere on the Persian shores of the Gulf on a proper footing. It would, in the first place, remove all question as to the position of the Besident and his Assistants towards British subjects and proteges, and as to their competency to deal with civil and criminal cases in which such persons may be concerned. Inconvenience must necessarily have been frequently caused by the inability of the Besident to enforce any decree or decision which he might pass in a civil suit, 18858.

On tins point, dated 25th February 187H. Colonel Eoss* remarks ; That instances of such a kind have, if not wholly evaded, at least been rare and un important, is due, I think in a great meaisure :— 1st. To the great caution, prudence, and tact exercised by the Political Officers under the impression of the delicate nature of the subject. 2nd. That few cases have presented themselves for adjudication involving very large pecuniary interests. 3rd. That most of the British subjects residing within the limits of the jurisdiction are natives of India, who from natural temperament and other reasons are indisposed to raise such a question. If cases of magnitude happened to occur, I think it extremely probable that the parties against whom awards should be made would, especially if Englishmen, question the validity of such award. In cases of a refusal to abide by it there seems to be no means of enforcing such judgment locally. The case of Moolchund and Morwarud, two British subjects, which gave rise to the above remarks, and which, after four years of correspon dence between the Bushire Kesidency, the mission at Teheran and the Persian authorities, is still unsettled, would almost certainly have been disposed of long agOj had the Resident's powers been defined by Order in Council. So also as to criminal cases. British Indian subjects may be dealt with under the provisions of Indian Act XI. of 1872 which has been quoted ; but under present circumstances the Resident has no power to proceed against either a European British subject or the subject of a pro tected Native State; as Colonel Prideaux observes, ' there seems no ' via media between allowing an Englishman accused of a serious ' offence to go scot-free, or waiving our extra-territorial jurisdiction in &lt;f his case and handing him over to the local authorities for trial.' Continued absence of crime among European British subjects in the Gulf cannot be relied upon, and unless some Order be issued, a failure of justice may occur at any time. An Order of the limited scope suggested could not, of course, in all its provisions be made to apply absolutely to Civil cases in which Persians are concerned, whether as plaintiffs or defendants. Persian plaintiffs must come to the British Court in the first instance, but there might be difficulty about appeal. Persian defendants could not be compelled to come to the British Court, and the Persian authorities might object to their doing so voluntarily. Such cases would have to be dealt with diplomatically, as at present. The objections to resorting to diplomacy for a settlement of cases which are fitting subjects for legal proceedings are obvious; but Colonel Ross' list shows that in trivial cases,—and in the Persian Gulf, the cases are mostly trivial, though there are ex ceptions,—this method of procedure is fairly effective, for cases to linger until the parties are exhausted is, as the Government of India remark, a result which is not unknown elsewhere. The broad question, therefore, which the Secretary of State in Council has to consider is, whether he will press the Foreign Office to take the necessary steps to give effect to the scheme of Consular Jurisdiction for the whole of Persia, which has been elaborated by the late Sir P. Francis, Sir A. Kcmball and Mr. Reilly,—the necessary preliminary being a Convention with Persia; or whether he will suggest the framing, without further delay, of an Order in Council of more limited scope, which shall be applicable, in the first instance, only to the littoral of the Persian Gulf, unless Lord Derby should think it essential to include in it arrangements for the interior of Persia. There is, of course, a third alternative, viz., to drop the question, and let matters rest as they are; but I presume that the adoption of this will not be thought expedient. In the event of it being decided to issue an Order, limited in its scope, as has been suggested, it will be necessary to decide whether a local Judge of Appeal shall be established at Bushire, or whether all appeals from the Resident, when allowed, shall go to Bombay. On this point it31 would be improper for me to venture an opinion, but the views of Colonel Ross, as expressed demi-officially in a letter dated the 10th July last, may be worth attention :— The proposed plan of establishing a local Judge of Appeal at Bushire, seems to me rather inappropriate to the existing circumstances. Unless litigation, under greater facilities, increased enormously, and appeals were encouraged, I do not see that there would be a week's work in a year for such a functionary. The influence aud local consideration of the Resident, in a great degree, are derived from his position as the one authority on the spot to whom all appeals in all matters lie. I think it is very desirable the Resident should continue to exercise, under Government, undivided con trol in all matters over his Assistants and Agents. Many of the cases coming forward for adjustment in the Gulf have to be decided more by local usage and tradition than by any regular system of law. Many, too, involve political considerations. The purely political duties are not sufficiently onerous and important to demand or to admit of the Resident being relieved of the other duties and responsibilities altogether without impairing his influence and usefulness. In fact, I do not consider there is room for both a Resident and a separate Court of Appeal at Bushire. One of them would be de trop. The issue of Consular Commissions to the Officers of the Gulf is a question for the Eoreign Office, but on this point also Colonel Ross may be quoted:— From my point of view, which, of course, is restricted, what we want in the Gulf, in the first instance, is Consular commissions or warrants of some similar purport. As now con stituted, for instance, the Resident might have honorary rank of Consul-General; First and Second Assistants, Consuls ; Uncovenan ted Assistant, Vice-Consuls, and the Native Agents, perhaps, might be Consular Agents.' The views originally held by the Government of India, both on this question and that of appeal, as set forth in their letter, No. 19, dated 24th January 1873, have been already quoted {see p. 7). Any Order which may be issued for the Persian shores of the Gulf, will require to be supplemented by an Order, on the same model, ap plicable to the Arab Coast. The procedure throughout the whole extent of the Gulfs of Persia and Oman will then be duly authorised, the Turkish territories being covered by the terms of the Ottoman Order of the 12th December 1873, while an Order dated the 4th November 1867 applies to the possessions of the Sultan of Muscat. Modifications have been suggested in both these Orders with a view of establishing uniformity of system throughout the Gulf, but they are, probably, not indispensable. With these remarks, and with an apology, both for the length of this memorandum and the very imperfect way in which the subject has been dealt with, I respectfully submit the papers for Orders. A. W.
