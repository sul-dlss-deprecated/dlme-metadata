The Secretary then requests to be informed of the outcome of the investigation into the attempted poisoning of Colonel Phayre, sending their sympathies to him in that matter and informing him that Colonel Pelly has been instructed to send all correspondence relating to the enquiry directly to the Government of India, with duplicates to be sent to the Government of Bombay and only to send correspondence relating to the running of Baroda State to the Government of Bombay first.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000383#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
