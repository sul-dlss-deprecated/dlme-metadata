I- My dear Claus on ^ May 1 refer to Rendel^ letter No.E. 5825/2902/91 of the 6th October 5 and connected correspondence dealing in the Persian Gulf. The Admiralty concur with the India Office m thinking any claim which may be made to these islands should be made by or on behalf of one or more of our Arab clients. We feel that the present moment would be a somewhat inopportune one to suggest annexation by Great Britain. Annexation of an island* however unimportant, would provide Germany and Italy with a welcome dart to throw at us and might prove a convenient precedent for Red Sea whose ownership is at present doubtful. We note with interest from the correspondence you subsequently sent us (Loch’s express letter of the 1st October, P„Z.7366/36) that the Sheikh of Kuwait claims the Islands of Parsi and Arabi. We suggest that further investigation should be made on the spot with a view to establishing a definite claim with supporting evidence.

LM it would be a mistake to regard the ownership ot these islands as determined by the geographical position &gt; as is suggested by several passages in Rendel's letter of 6th October. The award of the Hague Court m the Palmas island case shows that contiguity is not admissible as a legal method of deciding questions of territorial sovereignty. We would also like to draw attention to the fact that according to I.G.13 there are certain other islands in the Gulf of which the status has not so far been determined, for example Halul, Kran and Shura-Awah, in audition to islands such as DaImah, Sir Deni Yus and Sir Abu Nair which we regard as belonging to one or other of our clients, but which do not seem to have oeen definitely taken possession of either by them or on their behalf. We suggest that it might be advisable to deal with all such islands at the same time, not only because the question of oil has now become an active one, but also because any attempt to establish claims of this cha.racter will very likely lead Persia to consider raising similar claims herself. As regards Parsi and Arabi, it may be of interest to you to know that a survey of the coastline of these islands was made by H.M.S.TRIAD m 1927-28, on a scale of 20 inches to a mile. The fair chart of the surveys shows them as being low lying, 650 and 475 yards long respectively and consisting of sand covered with coarse scrub. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Piendel at the Foreign Office.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1, 25th March, 1937. Would you kindly refer to Rendel’s letter to Clauson dated tne 6th October, No.E.5825/2902/91, and connected correspondence about the status of certain ViXb^ islands in the Persian Gulf? / \ - 2. You will now have seen Bushj^e Express Letter of the 15th January, 1937, No. 75-3, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on the 12th February, p.Z. 938/37. The position we have reached is that &lt;..p the Sheikh of Koweit claims the islands of Farsi and T -&gt; Arabi as undoubtedly his property by virtue of immemorial usage, that Harqus (which is not known to the Sheikh by that name) is used mostly by Koweit boats as a shelter in adverse weather, is nearer to Koweit than Farsi and Araoi, and is for these reasons regarded by the Resident as clearly belonging to the Sheikh also. 3. We are thus in possession of all the information with which the local authorities can supply us in regard H. L. Baggallay, Esq., to/ Foreign Office, S.W. 1.to these islands, and Fowle recommends that the Sheikh of Kov/eit should he informed that he had better show an outward and visible sign of his ownership by hoisting his flag on them. Incidentally, with reference to paragraph 11 of Rendel's letter of the 6th October, it seems clear that the islands are not of any size nor do they possess any regular inhabitants or resources, and therefore it is presumably unnecessary to establish any kind of administration on them, but if we advise the Sheikh as proposed we should also, I imagine, advise him to send an official from time to time to inspect the islands and keep his authority alive. 4. We have now to decide whether or not to accept the Resident’s recommendation. We assume that in the light of the information now available you will not be disposed to pursue the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should themselves annex the islands (as being res nullius ), and you may prefer that Fowle’s recommendation should be accepted. But before submitting the paper here we should be glad to know the considered views of the Foreign Office on the following point. The/5. The information which we have received from the Sheikh of Koweit does not entirely dispose of the possibility that some other Power (Saudi Arabia, for example) may have, or advance, a claim to the islands, and might even be able to advance grounds of some sort for such a claim. But in the event of a subsequent supportable claim by the Persian Government or by the Saudi Government that the islands belong to them and not to the Sheikh, it would, we feel, be very difficult to go back on the Sheikh and admit the counterclaim. The question is therefore whether it is quite clear that if we decide to advise the Sheikh on the lines indicated in paragraph 3 of this letter, we shall be prepared to support him against a possible counter-claim. Or, in view of the fact that we are necessarily ignorant as to the existence or non-existence of any such counter-claim and of the grounds on v/hich, if it exists, it would be advanced, would it be better to leave matters alone and not encourage the Sheikh to take action which might evoke such a counter-claim? We feel it is essential to get the point clear in advance, and I assume/assume you will l)ear it in mind when you consider the whole question. 5. If it is decided to accept Powle’s recommendations in regard to these three islands we may, no doubt, accept also the recommendations in regard to the other islands which he makes in his letter of the 9th December, 1936 (copy to the Foreign Office on the 8th Janua] P. Z, 100/37). 6, I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSON4963 2000 7.36 By *ir Mail. P.Z.

My dear clauson Uo May i reier to your letter P.Z.938/37 of the 25th March about the status of certain islands in the Persian Gulf. 2. The Admiralty see no objection to the proposal that the Sheikh of ICoweit should annex the three islands Farsi, Persian reactions in other parts of the Gulf, it will be as well ror action to be taken in relation to the islands at the same time or at any rate within a very short period thereafter. the list of islands m P.G.13 is not complete and that there are m fact a fair number of others, the political ownership of which does not seem to have been determined. Some of these islands, particularly thos e in the vicinity of Qatar, might conceivably be oil bearing, and therefore Arabi and Harqus, but we feel that in view of possible 3 We also wish to draw your attention to the fact that / v/ ell worth cla inn ng 4 The islands we have m mind could be divided into three groups, as follows;- Group i - Northern; off Coast of Al Adan (Latitude 27° - 28 N.) al Karan al Kurain J anah Jaraid Group II - Hocks north of Bahrein - most of which cover at High Water.

The Admiralty suggest that the political Resident should consider whether sovereignty to al Karan and al Kuram should be asserted at the same time. The islands of Janah and Jaraid appear to be too close to the territory of Ibn Saud for sovereignty to be established without incident, but we think that the political Resident should be reminded of the existence of these islands in order that their status can be determined. 6. Group ll. P.G.13 states that the Bahrein archipelago consists of Bahrein, Muharraq, Hum na'assau, Sitrah and Habi Salih. The status of Muharraq is therefore already determined. It is only separated from Bahrein by a narrow channel and the Sultan of Bahreinis palace is m fact on it. Fasht al Yarim _s close to northward of Bahrein and sovereignty m_ght be claimed over this. Najwa and Chaschus are close to Saudi territory. Fasht al dibal is between Bahrein and Qatar but closer to the latter. We believe, however, that Fasht al Yarim and Fasht al dibal are really reefs rather than islands. The Admiralty suggest that the political Resident should be asked whether Bahrein or Qatar can/w V 3IK ,,a' m can make any claim to Fasht al Yarim &gt; Najwa 5 Ckstschus or Fasht al d'bal. 7. Group 111. The Political Resident has already recommended that the sheikh of Abu Dhabi should fly his flag on Halul, Shura-Awah* Dalinah and Sir Beni Yas, and that the Sheikh of Shargah should do the same at Sir Bu Ra Air. The remaining islands appear to fall geographically into groups as followss- (i) (a) Daiyinah is. on the line Halul-Sir Beni Yas and closer to Abu Dhabi than Snura-Awah. (b) Halat Masuma is close to Dalmah. (c) Raschid is close to Sir Beni Yas. (d) The following islands are closer to Abu Dhabi thanHalul;- Zirko, Das* Q.arnain* Arzana* al Isha* Bazam al Gharbi* Al Fiha* Halat Hail* Al Junaina. The Admiralty propose therefore that the political Resident should consider whether the sovereignty of Abu Dhabi can be established to the islands mentioned at (a)* (b)* (c) and (d) above. (ii) The following islands are close to Qatar* and we suggest that the political Resident should investigate the possibility o^'- that State^ucquinng th^fim - Halat Dalma* Machasib* JCafai* Miyamet entin (group)* Fareijat* Yasat. \s 8.

Dated 20th August 1937. ^ Captain T. Hickinbotham I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi. a The Honourable the Political^Rasident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subjects Status of certain islands in the Persian Gulf. Sir, / u /If e he I have the honour to refer to your memorandum No. 499-S dated June 25th 1937 and to state that my enquiries to date have elicited the following information with regard to the status of certain islands in the Persian Gulf. 2. Of the ^islands and reefs mentioned in group II / , paragraph 4 of the enclosure to India Office printed letter No. P.Z.2909/37 dated April 29th 1937 the Bahrain Government claim Fasht A1 Jarim and Fasht Dibal. These are two reefs and are covered at spring tides. The Bahrain Government do not claim the Islands of Najwa and Chaschus. I have not addressed the Ruler of Qatar regarding these islands as their geographical position would seem to preclude any possibility of his being able to substantiate a claim to them. 3. In addition to the islands mentioned in paragraph 6 of the enclosure to the India Office printed letter under reference as forming the Bahrain archipelago the Bahrain Government claim the Harwar group consisting of nine islands near the Coa ;t of Qatar and also Qattah, Jarada, Khor Fasht, and A1 Binat Islands. In paragraph 6 the Bahrain archi pelago is stated to consist of 'Bahrain Muharraq w . This is inaccurate as Bahrain is the name of the group of islands2 wiwiwjjjpphUiiiiB iftrrxm/fak islands and the group consists of ,f Manaxnah t Ivluhorraq, Um Nahsen ”♦ 4. Of the islands and reefs mentioned in group II it is possible that the Buler of Qatar might lay claim to Fasht Dibal. Of the additional islands claimed by the Bahrain Government it is possible that he might claim Qattah Jarada v,hich lies close to Fasht Dibal, and practically certain that he would claim the Harwar group# I have purposely refrained from addressing him on the subject as I understand that at this stage it is merely required to ascertain whether the islands can be con sidered to belong to the Arab Shaikhdoms enjoying British Protection or Ytrhether they must be considered as part of the territory of a Foreign Power. Therefore provided that one of the protected Shaikhs claims sovereignty over the islands in question no further enquiries need be instituted which would probably give rise to undesirable controversy between the Shaikhs themselves# 5. My enquiries regarding the islands mentioned in group III and paragraph 7 show that the islands of Daiyinah, Bashid, Das, Arzanah, Bazm A1 Gharbi, Halat Hail, Zirako, Qarnain, and A1 ^sh (not f Isha) are either inhabited by or frequented by the subjects of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi would be able to establish his claim to sovereignty over these islands without his claim being contested by other states. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, who has recently made personal enquiries f ; om the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, reports that there is no such island as Halat Masuma and I venture to suggest that possibly the island3* island marked on the Admiralty chart is really a sand bank which is normally covered except at exceptionally low tides and may be considered for the purposes of these investigations as part of the island of Dalmah* 6. The Hesidency Agent further reports that no such island as A1 Fiha is known but possibly this may have been confused with a creek of the name Lidkhal A1 Fiha« It is probable^ tMt as A1 Fiha is shown on the chart as being close to the coast and mangrove swamps are noted in the immediate vicinity^ that 4taMEaMsr.y the island thought to be A1 Fiha should in reality be considered as a part of the mainland located in the vicinity of Midkhal A1 Fiha creek. 7. While the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi claims sovereignty over the islands of Halal, Shara-auh, Dalmah and Sir Bani Yas his flag, normally, is only flown on Dalmah. This is done on Fridays and when His kaiesty* s Ships visit the island• 8. ■ The Shaikh of Sharjah claims Sir Bu Nu’air and Abu Musa islands but only flies his flag on Abu Musa on occasions similar to t.iose on which the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi flies his at Dalmah. 9. With reference to sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph 7 of the enclosure to the India Office printed letter under reference I am now addressing the Ruler of Qatar. I did not do so before as I wished to ascertain if the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi put forward any claim to these islands before addressing the Ifciler of Qatar.

Farsi The Shaikh of Kuwait claims Farsi and Arabi as Arabi his property by virtue of immemorial usage. Harqus Haraus (which is not known to the Shaikh of Kuwait by that name) is used mostly by Kuwait boats as a shelter in bad weather; it is nearer to Kuwait than Farsi and Arabi and is for these reasons regarded by the Political Resident as clearly belonging to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The Political Resident recommends that the Shaikh of Kuwait should be informed that he had better show an outward and visible sign of his ownership by hoisting his flag on all three Islands. (See P.Z.100/37 and P.Z.938/37. ) A1 Karan Local opinion is that these Islands belong to Ai Kurain the Shaikh of Kuwait. It is the custom of Kuwait pearlers to resort to Al Karan where the anchorage is sheltered, for the ''Redda' or smaller pearl season; they also land there to collect turtles, turtle-eggs and eggs of sea birds. Al Kurain is used occasionally for the same purpose. The Political Resident recommends that the Shaikh of Kuwait should assert his sovereignty to these Islands at the same time as he does to Farsi, •Arabi and Haraus. (See P. Z. 5578/37. ) Janah Larimer (Vol.2, pp.660, 901 and 905) states that Jaraid these Islands must be taken to be included in the Hasa Sanjaq. Moreover, the Political Agent, Kuwait, reports that though the Islands are used by Kuwaiti fishermen in the same way as Al Karan and Al Kurain, Kuwaitis feel less strongly a sense of ownership to. sense of ownership to.2 . ■■IHHMHMIMWnHMiHl GROUP I (Pont.)

The Acting Political Resident considers that the Islands must he regarded as attached to Hasa . Sir T. Fowle concurs. (See P. Z.6099/37. )/ Pasht al Yarim All these Islands are claimed by the Bahrain Pasht Dibal Government. The Ruler of Qatar has not been Qattah consulted but the Political Agent, Bahrain, Jarada considers it possible that he might claim Pasht Khor Pasht Dibal, Qattah and Jarada, and practically certain Al Binat that he would claim the Hawar Group. As regards The Hawar the latter, it will be recalled that the question Group. of the ownership of the Kawar Islands was considered last year (see P.Z.4582/36 in Col.30/123)’in connection with the oil negotiations for the Bahrain unallotted Area. The decision then reached was 'that on the evidence then available these Islands appeared to belong to the Shaikh of Bahrain, and that the burden of disproving his claim lay on other potential claimants'’. This decision was x by Mr. Walton at the India Office. communicated verbally 5 * to Mr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, on 16th July, 1936, and it was explained to him. that it would be impossible to give a final ruling without knowing whether the Shaikh of Qatar has a claim, and hearing it if he has one.

From Secretary of State for India - • ( Government of India, External Affairs Dept,, repeated To ( to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Karachi) ( and Political Agent, Bahrein, Dated 30th August, 1938, Office regarding the Status of the Islands of Tumb ? Little Tumbj Abu Musa, Parur, Little Parur and Sirri. 2. As regards Tumb , Little Tumb and Abu Musa , there seems no reason to dissent from the statement of the position in paragraph 7 of Mr. Baggallay's letter, viz. that His Majesty’s Government have always maintained the view that these islands belong to our Arab proteges and must therefore be excluded from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s calculations. This is apparently recognised by the Company. 3. As regards Farur and Li t tl e Parur the former is indisputably Persian and there is little question that Little Parur (the status of which has never been formally determined) must be regarded as Persian - ( see Part B on page 105 of P.G.13). There would appear to be no objection, therefore, to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company including these Islands in their calculations if they so desire. 4. There remains the question of Sirri. The effective occupation of this Island by Persia since 1887 and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty’s Government (and of the Sheikh of Sharjah under protest) make it difficult, if not impossible to dispute the long-standing Persian claim and if the Island is sufficiently interesting from the oil point of view, it would seen best for the reasons given in the No. P.Z. 5665/38 Please refer to encloEForeign Office letter to let the Company include it in the 100,000 square miles without making any reference to its doubtful ownership. But if the Island is so included, it may he desirable, as Mr. Baggallay suggests, to say something to the Persian G-overnment which, without raising the question of status in a controversial form, will make it clear to them that although acquiescing in the inclusion of Sirri in the Company’s proposals, His Majesty’s Government reserve their position, as before, as to its international status. Until, however, the Company’s intentions are known, it is unnecessary to consider the act ial terms of the communication to be addressed to the Persian Government. 5. Please telegraph urgently whether you agree with the foregoing. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. (Sgd.) R. PEEL.P.Z.5665/38 (E 4674/127/34) POHEICtP OP -ICE, 3.V/.1. 11th August ? 1938. My dear Giftson ? Elkington and Mylles of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company came to see me on the 8th August seeking certain information about the 'boundaries of Persian territory. -‘-he Company need this information in view of the fact that they must 'before the 31st December next choose 100,,000 square miles of Persian territ ory and operate their concession within these 100,000 square miles only thereafter. 2. In the first place, Elkington and Mylles wished to see the texts of the tv/o instruments which are mentioned in the } v • c O Perso-Iraq Frontier Treaty of the 4th July 1937, i.e. the protocol of the 4th November 1913 and the proces-verftaux of the Delimitation Commission of 1914 insofar as they lay down the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. I showed them these two documents and let them take notes of the important passages (see Page 4 of the protocol, eleven lines from the bottom of the page, and page 11 (Deuxieme Seance) in the proces verbaux. 3. I explained that the position was complicated by the fact that, even in 1914, the Commissioners had said that the frontier started at a point which was in fact an appreciable distance from the mouth of the river, and that since 1914 the land on either side of the mouth of the river had grown still further, but added that v/e were reasonably confident that, if it came to the point, we could dispose of this difficulty, and uphold the contention that the frontier between Iraq and Iran, as laid down by the 1913-1914 documents and confirmed by the Treaty of the 4th July 1937, followed the low water line on the left bank of the ^hatt-el-Arab until the river reached the 4./ open sea. J.P, Gibson Esq.Sr'2. - 4. With regard to the question of v/hat line the frontier ^should follow when once it reached the open sea (which we took to he when it reached the extreme southerly tip of Marakat Ahadan) P I said that P in the opinion of His Majesty’s Governments the most natural, simple and reasonable method of dividing territorial waters was to plot a line all points on which were equidistant from the nearest points on the two coasts, which was another way of saying that a ship would always he in the territorial waters of the country to whose coast it happened to he closest at any particular moment. I made it clear, however, that this was only the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, and that the point could not he said to he covered hy international law, since no rule of lav; had grown up hy custom and there had never heen any authoritative arbitral decision. 5. ^Ikington and Mylles then asked for information upon the status of the following islands - Sirri, Nabiya Farur; Farur, Nabiya Tunb, Tunh and Abu Musa. G. I explained that Sirri had heen occupied hy the Persians in 1387, and.effectively administered hy them ever since, and that we had from time to time recognised that the Persians were in effective occupation hy notifying them when British survey vessels, for example, wished to go there; hut that we had also always made it clear that this recognition of the de facto position did not imply t at we admitted in any way that they had any legal right to the sovereignty of the island. On the other hand, we were prepared, as the Persians knew quite well, to recognise their sovereignty over the island as part of a general settlement of Persian Gulf questions. 7. With regard to the others, the position of ITabiya Parur was that it was indeterminate, inasmuch as it had never heen recognised hy us as belonging to Persia. At the same time, no one/ n i ■ v 7 13. cn one else had any good claim to it ; and it was most unlihul,/ ouc-.t ^ we would wish to make any trouble in the event o: r ’ Persians claim ing it^as theirs. In all probability ? the Persians in fc&gt;cu regarded it as theirs for many years past, and would Quite likely be surprised and indignant at any suggestion to tne contrary. Farur was unquestionably Persian. ITabiya Tunb, Tunb and Abu Musa, on the, other hand, were unquestionably Arab - or at least ‘ • f . • so we alv/ays maintained - although the Persians clai ed tuem m the same way as they claimed Bahrein. 8 . Elkington said that, in view of what I had said, it was clear that the Company must rule the last three islands out of their calculations altogether, and make no attempt to include them in the 100,000 square miles. As regards Farur, on the other hand, the Company would clearly be in order in including it in their area if they decided that it was worth including. ihere seemed to be some doubt, however, over Sirri and liabiya Farur, and he asked what I thought the Company should do. 9 . I said that, speaking offhand and entirely personally, I thought that, if these islands were sufficiently interesting', from the oil point of view, to be worth including in the 100,000 square miles, the Company should include them and have done with it and, what was more, include them without making any reference to their doubtful ownership. 'this seemed co me unquestionably the righ : : line in the case of Nabiya Farur, but I also felt prett confident that it was the right line in the case of Sirri too. If this island was ''interesting' and the Company did not take it, the Persians would be free to include it in a concession to some other company, possibly and indeed probably a non-British company. It was most unlikely that, if that happened, His Majesty’s Government would in uhe upshot be aole to take any effective action to stop them, and the result would be that/A that His Majesty’s Government would have the worst of all worlds. If the Company followed the course which I had suggested; the result might he to reduce yet further such small bargaining value as Sirri still possessed for His Majesty’s Government; and this might still he the case even if His Majesty’s Government made some declaration; on having the terms of the new concession area 'brought to their notice? to the effect that they did not recognise Sirri as being under Persian sovereignty. But this was? in my opinion? a lesser evil than leaving Sirri as a -possible prey to some other company and losing its bargaining value anyhow. 10. Ellcington said that? in view of these explanations? the Company would now go ahead and try to form some idea a.s to whether the islands of Farur? 1'Tabiya Parur and Sirri were worth including in the future concession area.; and would; in the event of their deciding that Sirri was worth including? go ahead, and include it, if we agreed, without more ado. I said that I thought this would be all right, and undertook to find out as quickly as possible whether the views I had expressed were approved. 11 . Bikington also explained that it was the present intention of the Company to include the whole of the Persian coast line from the Iraqi frontier to the Baluchistan frontier, for at least a short distance inland, in the new area. They could not afford to have other companies actually on the coast. They would also in certain places have to include parts of the sea under which oil might conceivably be found, and it was for this reason that the frontier position at the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab was, or might be, of importance to them. The method they proposed to adopt in doing this was to define certain astronomically fixed points, the lines joining which would be the limits of the area. For instance, one part of the new concession area/area would probably be described as being bounded on the uouth- East by the frontier dividing Persia from Irac from such and such such a point to the sea 3 from the point v/here the frontier meets the sea to an astronomical point abc ; from there to astronomical point ::yz ? and sc forth. 12 . I should be very grateful if you could let me know as soon as possible whether you think that any modification is needed in the views I expressed about Sirri. I have little doubt in my own mind what the company ought to do if they think Sirri v/orth including in their area. I am less sure about what His Majesty’s Government ought to do if confronted with a concession agreement between the company and the Persians including Sirri (it would make little difference whether Sirri was mentioned b. name or lumped with other islands as being north of a certain line drav/n between points in the sea). I feel we should have to say something, but we should have to try to say it without dragging the company into political questions. Perhaps we could say something to the effect that we regarded the inclusion of the island as the natural outcome of the fact that the Persians were, as we had always recognised, in actual and effective occupation, but that we reserved our position, as before, as to its international status. 15.

Would you kindly p6fer to your letter of the 11th August (No. E.4674/127/^1-) concerning your recent talk with Elkington and Mylles of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company about the boundaries of Persian territory? 2. As regards Tunib, Little Turnb and Abu Musa, the position is as stated in paragraph 7 of your letter viz. in our view they belong to our Arab proteges and must be excluded from the Anglo Iranian Oil Company’s calculations. vie note that this position is accepted by the Company, but you will no doubt consider whether it might not be desirable to state the position in writing to them. 2. As regards Farur and Little Farur, the former is indisputably Persian and there is little ouestion that Little Farur (the status of which has never been formally determined) must be regarded as Persian. \/e agree, therefore, that there would be no objection to the Anglo Iranian Oil Company including these islands in their calculations if they so desire.

Dear liyllea. You will remember that when you and iilkington came to see me on the 8th ^u&amp;ust you asked, amon^ other things, for information about the status of the following islands in the Persian Gulf - Sirri, j-.abiya I'arur, jj’arur, Yabiya Tunb, Tunb and ^bu Kusa - in order that your Company should be able to decide v/hether these islands could be included in the 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which they have to choose as their concession area before the end of the year. 2. At the meeting which l had with you, Lees and .Browne on the 7th iieptember, you asked the same question about J'arsi and ^rabi. 3. I am now able to let you have the definite answer about all these islands which i promised you. The answer largely confirms what i said during our con versations. 4. It is as follows:- (a) l.abiya Tunb, Tunb and Abu Musa are, in our viewy unquestionably Arab and should be ex cluded from the Company's concession area. (b) On the evidence available, tfarsi and Arabi must be regarded as belonging to the Bheikh of Koweit and should likewise be excluded from the Company's area. ./e are, hov/ever, anxious to avoid entering into any controversy with the iraniary^Iranian Government about these islands and it would help us if the Jompany could refrain from saying anything about the liheikh's claims to (c) S’arur is indisputably Iranian, and little i’arur, though its status has never been formally determined, must be regarded as Iranian too. There is therefore no objection to the Jompany including these two islands in their concession area, if they so desire. (d) Sirri has been in the effective occupation of the Iranians since lb87, and since the exist ence of this occupation has from time to time received de facto recognition from His Majesty’s Government, we should not object to the Jompany including the island, if they v/i sh, in their concession area v/ithout making any reference to its doubtful ownership. if the Company do in- some stage make some declaration to the Persian Government v/hich, without raising the question of status in a controversial form, will make it clear that, although acquiescing in the inclusion we reserve our position, as before, regarding them to the Iranians of the island in the Company’s concession area its international status bd. lacy baggullay( CON g ILSN TIA L« The Hon f bXe the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, presents his compliments to ■^he Political Agent, Bahrain, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the under mentioned document (s)with the request that he will kindly forward any comments or suggestions he may wish to make so ^ar as the island of Halul is concerned.

In reply to our letter, the Ministry drew our attention to some previous correspondence, which passed in 1937-8, which we had overlooked. In case you have not access to your files, I enclose copies of Jfowle’o demi-official letters to Peel of 1st August and llth October, 1938, which are the relevant papers in this (''nnv, * .■ 3. Of the islands mentioned in the recent corres pondence, it appears that Abu Dhabi has claims to Halul, while the Shaikh of Kuwait claims Parsi, Arab! and Harous. You will see that Fowle suggested in his letter of llth ctober, 1938 that the Shaikh of Kuwait might be encouraged to strengthen his claim to sovereignty over these three ib jands (amopg others) by some unobtrusive methods, e.g. by visiting the islands or sending a representative to erect cairns on them as marks for navigation. Por some reason, which is not now apparent, no reply seems to have been sent to Powle’s letter and there is no record here °7' il irthe ^ action having been taken, either in respect oi the three islands mentioned above, or the others.
