However, the minutes also discuss matters relating to the wider Middle Eastern region, as reflected in the change of name to Middle East Committee in August 1917.In addition to minutes, the file includes the following: a draft report by the committee, dated March 1917, containing recommendations regarding future British policy in Mesopotamia and the wider region (ff 1-2); a letter to George Curzon from Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Sykes, dated 2 July 1917, recommending that the committee be renamed, in order to define its scope and work (ff 24-25).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Meetings</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet, Middle East Committee</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir 6th Baronet Mark Sykes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military occupation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001491.0x0002a6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
