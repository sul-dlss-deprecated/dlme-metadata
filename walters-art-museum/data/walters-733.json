The Nayika (female lover or heroine) sits alone, while her 2 female companions, known as sakhis, converse in the other bower. The painting may represent Utka nayika, a classification for heroines who are awaiting or yearning for their lovers. Often, they are shown on a bed of flowers or leaves that they have prepared in expectation of meeting their lovers. In the landscape are animals engaged in various activities. An outcrop of rocks in the distance forms a horizon, above which is a blue sky streaked with light gray or white washes to suggest a thin layer of high clouds.", "CreditLine": "Gift of John and Berthe Ford, 2001", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/31766", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Illumination; Illustration; Manuscript; Painting; India", "Provenance": "John and Berthe Ford, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 2001, by gift.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.876_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.876_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.876_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.876_Fnt_UK.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/ARG_W.876_Fnt_UK.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507458", "ExhibIDs": "3171", "Images": "ARG_W.876_Fnt_UK.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
