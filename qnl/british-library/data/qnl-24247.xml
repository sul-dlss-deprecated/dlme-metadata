On his return to hebai I asked him to come to Sharjah bringing th«r original copy of the pfocesSverbal showing the settlement of his bankruptcy case. He came up with it and a copy is submitted herewith for your information. I demanded from Salem bin Musabbah, through the Ruler of Debai, to pay some money to Bunia Birumal. Salem after much difficulty agreed to pay ks.500 a ye^r should he earn any money from the diving venture but Birumal did not agree with this .tile claims made against i&amp;Bia him. The rclxcyin^ are the conditions agreed upon oy the parties to the compromise 1. That iialem’s creditors should pay him i&lt;s.l0,X)00 when they take delivery cT the pearls. This is a condition on which the compromise was eiTected between the parties. Salem’s creditors voluntarily offered it and agreed upon it. 2. That to deduct 10 52093 from the amount of the claims. That Salem is not responsible for a ay fall in the pr of the pearls he has surrendered to his creditors. Therefore Salem is responsible for only iu&gt; 1CQ,0U0/- which he is to pay in instalments in four years. ice Any of Slern’s creditors who desires to receive his dues he shcula advance Salem a sum of money to enable him to resume his business. Salem has to pay to his creditors namely those who advance him money at the rate of annas 4 per the rupee. As regards those who would not advance him money Salem should pay to each of them cut of the money which remains in his possession (after payment of the annas 4 per rupee instalments) as fixed between them. Thus this compromise came off between the creditors of Salem and the said debtor-- a compromise agreed upon by the consent of the parties without coercion C.T force. Dated 18th hamazan 1349.

A.C. Firstly I submit my heartfelt condolences on the sad occasion of the death of His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom, the Great Emperor George V to Your Honour in person and to the British nation in general, praying God to cover His Majesty's soul with His mercy and blessing and to grant Great Britain glory, prosperity, and success to the new King,the best successor. # Secondly and lastly I submit to Your Honour a copy of the l e tter which I sent to the late Residency Agent, Sharjah in reply to his, which I received in the month of Rabi ath Thani last (July 1935) on the subject of the claim of Viroomal Valabhdas against me. As the letter contains some points which I think the Residency Agent Sharkah would perhaps dislike, and also for other reasons which make me uneasy lest his report to you on the subject should not contain facts, I considered it necessary to submit this to you (a copy of my letter to him) with a view to acquainting you with facts and particularly as a long time has elapsed since the original was sent to him and I have not heard anything indicating the action which has been taken in the matter.Translation of a copy of a letter dated 25th Rabi ath Than! 1354 (26-7-35) from Mani »a bin Rashid, Debai, to Khan Bahadur Shaikh Isa bin Abdul Latif, Residency Agent, Sharjah. Your esteemed letter No. 258 was received and I under stood contents especially about the letter sent to you by the Hon*ble the Political Resident in connection with the claim of Viroomal Valabndas and that you have sent Husain bin Hasan to me in that respect. The latter did not come and the men who brought the letter were Yusuf bin Nasir and Muhammad bin Abdul Latif. The Bannia* s claim against me which is pretended to be Rs.12,000/- is incorrect. The original claim as it is des cribed in the bond dated 18th Zilhejjeh 1347 (26-5-1929) which the claimant holds is Rs.6600/- only being cost of 400 bags of Karachi rice. When the due date of the bond arrived not with standing the fact that the result of diving T^as not satisfac tory I paid him according to my ability Rs. 1000/- as part payment of the original claim and offered,through Haji Ismail Baqali trader, to meet the balance by giving him pearls at their cost price equivalent to his claim or even more than the- actual sum so that he may not charge me interest if payment was delayed. But the said Ismail Baqali returned saying that the said Bannia did not accept the offer giving good reasons for his refusal andsaid that he hopes that time may get better and that he would recover his right gradually and gave assurances of good treatment in our transaction. Thank God we have since the past been transacting with fairness with him and others. In view of tnis fact I do not recognize his claim for additional sum beyond that the original claim. He owes me shop rent from that period up to now. Since the time has gone from bad to worse, the Bannia has started claiming his dues for which he is not to be blamed and there is no use in wasting time swinging between hope and despair. I would only draw your and the Hon*ble the Political Resident*s attention to the principles acted upon from oldentimes on this coast in such particularly hard times as the present and the current financial crisis and would request you to follow the method as the one observed by your pre- cecessors and yourself as well, whenever the state of affairs necessitated it. I do not say anything about the situation in which I am now existing. I now offer him what I have in my hand and on which I lost all my capital,namely,my diving boats and divers with all claims due from them. He can take out of tnese as much as would satisfy his and other persons* claims. I would particularly invite your attention to your letters Nos.260 of 1951 dated 16th Safar 1550 (5-7-1951) and 525 of 1951 dated ;st Rabi ul Aval 1550 (17-7-1951) in connec tion with the claim of Bunnia Laku against Muhammad bin Biat and the settlement effected by you between them namely his earning from diving boats or divers. A similar settlement was effected during the time of the late Shaikh Maktum bin Hashar between Rashid bin at Adhab and Bunnia Rooymah (?) and recent ly during your time similar settlements were effected in other cases such as those between Bunnia Jita and Shaikh Reza Lari and Habib bin Hasan with Bin Darwish at Sharjah and elsewhere. There are many other cases also. I may also pay as much as my circumstances would allow as it was allowed in other persons* cases with a view to being fair, a thing in which there also is the concurrence of Great Britain although there would be a little left to me. My brother, I have already submitted to you petitions regarding my outstanding claims at Ras ul Khaimah as mentioned in the list attached herewith. I hope you will be able to settle this to enable me to meet claims against me as I fear recurrence of si similar debts but I have not achieved anything in this respect. You know and we know too that claims connected wi h sea and also naval questions are to be left to the British Govern ment and their sense of justice to deal with.If we refer to your letters as the one under 592 etc., we will find that you always refer to the 'usual custom' that in diving business there always is a margin for loss on both sides, that is to say that whoever takes divers he must pay for them. This also is the purport of the Treaty dated Rajab 1296 corresponding to 24th June :b?9 concluded between the Rulers with the British Government in connection with divers. Negligence on your part and the Rulers ignoring these orders have provided cause for transactions to spoil and rights to be wasted. Divers have as a result scattered and come late after the season to do diving, the period of which has since been reduced to/two months which make half the period which was formerly spent in diving. These are additional causes to other factors for the depression which h^s brought about the present deplorable result. What can we do when we are helpless and as there is no power nor strength but in God. We depend, in the circumstance, on the justice of the High Government. Further more I would remind you of my case with the Bunnia Ganshan with whom I appeared to settle the claim due to me on account of pearls. I have already warned you and my brother Shaikh Said bin Maktum that there are/claims also due by me to others and I am afraid that one of them might file a suit against me. I depend upon you and brother Shaikh Said bin Maktum to defend me against all who woulc rise against me so long as the time is hard. The time continues to be bad, as you see evidence is not lacking to support my statements. I conclude this with the statement that although the Hon T ble the Political Resident is far away from here yet it is not hidden from him in what a strait circumstance we are and in what a bad time. He is more powerful and his sense of justice is much more.Lb No. 123-B/10.-2.

His claims are against Shaikh Said bin Maktum the Ruler of Dubai [Shaikh Saʻīd bin Maktūm bin Hasher Āl Maktūm] and his brother Shaikh Man’a bin Rashid Al Maktum [Shaikh Mani bin Rashid Āl Maktūm], also Arab pearl merchant Salim bin Mussabbah bin Hamudah of Dubai, and the estate of Khan Bahadur Shaikh Isa bin Abdul Latif, the former Residency Agent at Sharjah, who died in September 1935. The correspondence consists mainly of the several petitions made by the plaintiff Viroomal Vallabdas, as well as letters in English and Arabic from Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan ‘Amad, the officiating Residency Agent at Sharjah, reporting his investigations to the Political Agent at Bahrain. There are English translations of a Tamask (credit note) from 1929 belonging to the defendant Salem bin Mussabbah bin Hamudah and an official record of the oral bankruptcy proceedings against him in 1931, before a Committee of Muslim citizens of Dubai and in the presence of his several creditors. In a letter to the Residency Agent, the defendant Shaikh Man’a bin Rashid Al Maktum refers to the settlement of similar debt recovery cases in Dubai, the current economic crisis and the losses suffered in the pearling industry.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Viroomal Vallabdas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
