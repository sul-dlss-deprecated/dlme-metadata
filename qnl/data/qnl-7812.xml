The nature of the appeals is twofold: appeals dating from 1930 request that the Viceroy of India (Edward Frederick Lindley Wood – referred to in the file as Lord Irwin, succeeded by Freeman Freeman-Thomas) use his influence on behalf of the British Government to urge Ibn Saud to reconstruct demolished shrines and monuments such as those at Janatul-Bakia [Jannat al-Baqīʿ]; later appeals, which date from 1933, call on the British Government to remain neutral regarding affairs in the Hejaz and Nejd, and to refrain from providing Ibn Saud with military, naval, or any other kind of assistance.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Janatul-Bakia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Tombs</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Private Secretary to the Viceroy of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz and Najd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Wahabi (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Muslims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000289#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000289#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
