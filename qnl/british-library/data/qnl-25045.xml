The first agreement, dealing with the remuneration which the company proposes, should be granted to it by the Russian Government for telegraph work m the erection or reconstruction of the main telegraph lines m the Russian sphere, and for the subsequent maintenance and working of these lines, is a question which concerns the Russian Government and your company. j i «-n j a With regard to the second of the agreements headed Proposed Agreement between the Imperial Russian and Persian Governments and the Indo-European Telegraph Company,” I am to observe that His Majesty s Government s arrangement with the Russian Government provides that the latter Government should eventually take over the control of the Tehran-Meshed line and of the line from Meshed up to Khaf, while the line from Khaf to Seistan would come under British control, so that the proposal of vour company in article 3 to maintain the line “from Meshed to Birjand” should be altered to “from Meshed to Khaf.” I am also to point out that thebontrol of the Tehran-Meshed line could not be made over to your company until the exchange of the control of that line from the British to the Russian Government, mfd of thelhaf-Seistan line from the Russian to the British Government, has been carried out by arrangement with the Persian Government.

The Company engages not to take steps ?/ith regard to this extension without previous consultation with the British Government» It has however to 'be noted that nothing is said about a Meshed-Herat line in the proposed Agreements with the Russian and Persian Governments, it is referred to only in Mr.Pagenkopf*s letter to M.de Klemm with which he sent the proposed agreements. /Wt 3*^ In my note of the 25th.instant below I wrote that I thought the proposal contained in the last paragraph of the Foreign Office letter of the 18th.September might be accepted. The Foreign Office propose to give the substance a r of my Memorandum of the 17th.July last to the Indo-European ■}t f' /, Telegraph Company. There seems no objection to the views expressed in paragraph 2 of the memorandum being explained to the Company. With regard to paragraphs 3 and 4 it would be sufficient to explain to the Company that our arrangement with the Russian Government is for that Government to take over the control of the Teheran-Meshed line and of the line from Meshed up to Khaf, while the line from Khaf to Seistan would come under British control, so that the pro posal of the Company to maintain the line ’’from Meshed to Birjand” should be altered to ’’from Meshed to Khaf”. It might also be pointed out to the Company that the control of the Teheran Meshed line could not be made over to it until Iuntil the exchange of the control oi that line fiom the British to the Russian Government and of the Khaf- Seistan line from the Russian to the British Government^ had been carried out by arrangement v/ith the Persian Government.

I am to state that Sir E. Grey proposes, subject to Lord Crewe's concurrence, to carry out Sir G.

No. 261 (35918) 2 !&gt;(&gt; ST. PETERSBURG, September 9th, 1911, V * • Sir:- With reference to your despatch No. 201 (28175) , of July 25th last, I have the honour to transmit here with a copy of the reply which I have received from Mr. Pagenkopf the representative in St. Petersburg of the Indo European telegraph Company to the communica tion which I addressed to him by your instructions with regard to the Company's proposed arrangements with the Persian Government. T regret that in the communication originally made to Mr. Pagenkopf the warning as to the construc tion of telegraph lines into Afghanistan was inadver tently omitted but this omission has now been made good and the warning has been conveyed. It is evident, I think, from Mr. Pagenkopf's letter that he is entirely dependent for instructions on LDl The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.on his principals in London. His letter moreover. leaves things exactly wher-e they were and the onus of suggesting any modifications in the Company’s agree ment with Persia is left with the Bussian Government. It is quite conceivable that in these circumstances an agreement might still he concluded which might subsequently involve us in difficulties and misun derstandings with the Russian Government. I there fore venture to suggest whether it would not be pos sible to give the principals of the Company in London some more definite indication as to the points in the proposed agreement which would clash with the arrangements which we have already concluded with the Russian Government or v/hether they might not at least be told that in any further conversations which their representative here may have with the Russian Authorities he should point out to them that he has been warned that such discrepancies exist and beg them to give careful consideration to the terms of the proposed agreement with a view to discovering where they would impinge on the arrangement already concludedconcluded between the British and Russian Governments I have &amp;C., (Signed) George W.

Sir:- T beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 8th August last, copy of which was forwarded at the time to my Company in London, and in reply I have been instructed to state that, as regards the proposed agreement with Persia, the Indo-European Telegraph Company is prepared to accept any modifica tions the Russian Government may deem necessary to bring the agreement into line with arrangements already entered into with the British Government. I am &amp;c., (Signed) L. Pagenkopf. J. Kidston, Esq., Secretary to His Britannic Majesty*s Embassy. St. Petersburg.CONFIDENTIAL. 7 T his document is the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. India Office, 17th July 1911. Sir, In reply to your letter No. 23,120, dated the 21st June 1911, regarding proposed agreements of the Indo-European Telegraph Company with the Russian and Persian Governments respectively, for the working and maintenance of certain telegraph lines in Northern Persia, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to enclose, for the consideration of Secretary Sir E. Grey, copy of a Note by the Director- in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department upon the subject. It will be seen that the proposed agreement with the Persian Govern ment is at variance in important matters with the arrangements that have been entered into by the British with the Russian Government, and that, in the opinion of Mr. Kirk, it is very desirable that the Convention regarding the Arabistan lines should be ratified so as to secure the renewal of the British Telegraph Conventions until the 1st January 1945. The Marquis of Crewe concurs generally in the views expressed in Mr. Kirk’s note, and would suggest that, if Sir E. Grey sees no objection, the reply to be made to M. Pagenkopf should be in the sense proposed in its final paragraph. In addition, it would seem well to convey to him a warning as regards what is said in his letter to M. de Klemm as to a possible extension of the telegraph line from Meshed to Herat, that no scheme of telegraphs into Afghanistan could be carried out except after consultation with the British Government. As regards the ratification of the Arabistan Convention, it is presumed that this is a matter in which the Persian Government will be advised by their newly-appointed Treasurer-General, Mr. Morgan Shuster. Lord Crewe would suggest, however, that if Sir E. Grey has no recent information in the matter, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran might be asked his opinion as to the likelihood of the Convention being ratified. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) R. Ritchie. The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office. 'JDi JTT ote on Foreign Office letter Ho.23120/ll dated 21st June 1911. In his letter below, ITo.lOO, dated 12th April 1911, to the Foreign Office Sir George Buchanan reported uhat hr. Pagenkopf^ the permanent representative of the Indo-European Telegraph Company in St. Petersburg^had visited the Embassy that day, and had indicated that there had been conversations, on the best means of improving the telegraph lines in northern Persia, with h. de KLemm at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but that these conversations had been purely of a general character ana nad not entered into details. In the correspondence now received with Foreign Office letter Ko.23120/ll of the 21st June last there is a copy of a letter, dated 5th April last from Mr. Pagenkopf to M. de Klemra, in which he explains the proposals of his Company for working the telegraph lines in northern Persia / and with which he forwards agreements that the Company proposes should be entered into for the purpose. This letter of Mr. Pagenkopf’s therefore was sent to the Russian Foreign Office a week before his visit to the Embassy when he V stated that no details on the subject had been entered into. 2. There are two Agreements to be considered. The first Agreement is the one it is proposed should be entered into between the Russian Government and the Indo-European Telegraph Company. There appears to be nothing in this proposed Agreement that the British Governmen'1 ^ (Aa^. I i Governme&amp;t can object to, as it defines the remuneration the Company proposes should be granted to it by the Russian Government for telegraph work in the erection or ^construe tion of the main telegraph lines in the Russian sphere of influence in n ersiaj and for the subsequent maintenance and working of these lines. This question of remuneration is one which only concerns the Russian Government and the Company, so far as it is dealt with in this Agreement. 3 ’ ilie second Agreement has the heading 'Proposed Agreement between the Imperial Russian and Persian Governments and the Indo-European Telegraph Company', but m his lette r of the 10th June to the British Ambassador Jr. Pagenkopf calls it the proposed Agreement with the Persian Government, which seems the more correct title, as all the telegraph lines the Company is prepared to undertake the control of are Persian Crown lines. This Agreement first gives a list of the telegraph lines the Indo-European Telegraph Company is prepared to take over. The third telegraph line mentioned in this list is the one between Keshed and Birjand. But under our arrange- ments with the Russian Government the line from Seistan zo IQlaf &gt; on whicil Birjand is an intermediate station, comes under the control of the British Government. In the list of lines therefore 'Meshed-Birjand' should be altered to 'Meshed-Khaf'. The last telegraph line shewn on the list is the Teheran-Khanekin line, which at present runs through Khaniabad and ITuveran to Hamadan. It will be seen the Company proposes to carry the line Ithrough Kasviri to harnadan, and then follow the present route into KHianenin. ^nis alteration will he a matter for the Company settle with the Persian Government. ^* *' Article I of the Agreement the Company asks for a guarantee of 5 per cent, on the capital it expends to put the lines in order, and on the cost of maintaining tiie lines afterwards. If the receipts from the traffic carried prove sufficient to provide this 5 per cent no contribution from the Russian or Persian Governments will oe called f&lt;\r . By Article 6 the Company proposes to collect and retain all charges for internal messages. So far the revanue from this class of traffic has been paid to the Persian Government. Por instance on the Teheran- Meshed line all the local traffic receipts have gone to the Persian Government, and the Indian Government pays up to a maximum of Rs.20,000 per annum for maintaining the line and working it with British telegraphists at Meshed and Teheran. It may be expected therefore that the Persian Government will not be willing to alter its present advantageous position as to this line^and adopt the pro posals of the Company with regard to it. In fact it seems desirable that the consent of the Persian Government should be obtained to the exchange of the control of the Teheran-Meshed line from the British to the Russian Government, and of the Khaf-Seistan line from the Russian to the British Government, before the Company’s proposals for working the former line are placed before the Persian Government. We have also an arrangement with the Russian Government by which British signallers, after the exchange of control of the lines has taken place, will be j % ml distationed at Teheran and Meshed to work that line at intervals daily* The Company apparently has no know ledge of tnis, as it is not referred to in the Agreement In Ir. Pagenkcpf’s letter of the 5th April lasu to -■ • de Klemm it will he seen that the Company is prepared to extend the Meshed line to Herat if this I should at an 3 r time become necessary. But Khaf, which is i to be a joint British and Russian Office, is the nearest | ?erslan t ' e I^g^aph office to Herat, and there is a road 1 between the two towns. The letter further refers to the Indo-Europe an Telegraph Department possibly wishing to relinquish part or all of its lines in Persia, and the Company being willing to assume charge thereof. Prom • urns ic would appear that the Company is looking forward to the possibility that the British Telegraph Conventions will not be renewed beyond 1925 by the Persian Govern ment. Uncfe r existing agreements the Department’s lines from Teheran to Bushire would then be taken over by the Company, and the Central Persia line could.also be made over to the Company by the Persian Government if v/hat remains of the debt on it for its construction was paid off by that Government. The Company could advance the money necessary for this to the Persian Government and would then be able to take over all the Department’s lines in Persia. It is very desirable that the Convention X x egardmg the Arabistan lines should be ratified, and our rjosition would then be secure till 1945. Otherwise in 1925 the Company might be found in control of all the main telegraph lines in Persia, working them, as stated in Mr. Pagenkopf’s letter of the 5th April to M. de Klemm, under the benevolent protection of the Russian Government1 0 6 * The - fi ’ orei en Office proposes, if the Secretary of State sees no objection to the terms of the two Agreements, that Kr. Pagenhopf should be informed accordingly I iWo snevm tnere are certain objections to the Agreement with Persia. I would suggest that the reply might perhaps ^ that : ' T - Pa eenkopf should be told that the proposed Agreement between the Russian Government and the Company,, on tne question of the Company's remuneration, is not one on which an opinion seems to be called for, but that the terms of tne proposed Agreement with the Persian Govern ment appear to require certain modifications to bring them into line with arrangements that have been entered into oy the British Government with the Russian Government, and that no doubt the Russian Government after a consideration of tne Agreement will point out what modifications are necessary.(V/ In any further communication on this subject, please quote vn No. 23120/11. and address— The Under-Secretary of State.

Your Excellency:- Referring to my letters of the 27th February/12th ^ March, 1910, No. 243, and of the 28th December, 1910,/10th January, 1911, No. 26, I have the honour to submit herewith to Your Excellency a project for the reconstruction, thorough repair, as well as an effective maintenance and working of the main Telegraph lines, in the Russian Sphere of Influence in Persia. The project consists:- 1. Of a proposed agreement between the Imperial Russian Government and the Indo-European Telegraph Company. (Page 1.) 2. Of a similar agreement between the Imperial Persian Government and the above Company. (Pages 2 to 7). 3. Of certain calculations showing the capital and annual expenditure required for carrying out the work. (Pages 8 to 15.) 4. His Excellency Monsieur de ftlemm. Vice-Director of the 1st Department, Ministry for Foreign Affairs, St. Petersburg.4. Of a statement showing the total estimated receipts and expenditure for one year under the proposed arrangement. (Page 16). As regards the proposed agreements I beg to state that they have received the approval of the Board of the Indo- European Telegraph Company. The calculations mentioned ad 3 and 4 were made by Mr. T. Casey, who has been for a long time the Company’s Representative in Persia, and is therefore thoroughly acquainted with Persian Telegraphs, and these calculations may consequently be considered as practically correct. The project now submitted has been on several occasions Imperial Russian Minister at Teheran, and Monsieur de Passek who was deputed by the Minister to go into the details of the project with our Mr. Casey, and in view of the very unre liable state of the Persian lines referred to hereunder, and the consequent inconvenience, confusion and losses caused f thereby, it was considered desirable to put forward these proposals which were fa.vourably viewed at the time these discussions took place. TheThe proposed scheme deals only with the main lines in the Russian Sphere of Influence, i.e. Teheran-Shahrud-Meshed S hahr ud - A star ab ad Meshed-Birjand ? Teheran-Casvin-Rescht-Astara Astara-Ardebil Tauri s-Maran da-Khoi -Di Iman -Ur umi a, up to the Turkish frontier at Baschkale, or via Maku-Bayazid (Trebizonde i Trade Route). Teheran-Casvin -Hamadan-Kerman shah-Khan ek in. To carry out the above undertaking, inclusive of a continuation of the Meshed line to Herat, should that at any time become necessary, or for instance should the Indo- European Telegraph Department v?ish to relinquish part or all of the lines under their Administration in Persia, and if the Company be willing to assume charge thereof, then a branch or extension of the Indo-European Company, with power and capital adequate for such an undertaking would have to be formed, such branch to be called the “Indo-European Extension 11 i •?1 Company MCompany'. The management of the new undertaking v/oulo be the sane as the parent Company. The proposed extension would simplify accounts and matters of general administration. The advantages to be gained from the proposeo. arrangement would in the first place accrue to Persian Commerce, both in temal end international, and next to Russian Commerce, as the neighbouring Country mostly concerned in the development of Persian commercial activity, and for this reason my Company trusts that the present proposals wall meet with the favourable con sideration of the Imperial Foreign Office and the final jm ]&amp;■ || tfp 1 r approval of the High Imperial Government. It is distinctly understood that the Company would do nothing that is not in accordance with the wishes of the Imperial Russian Government under whose benevolent protection the pr opoeed undertaking would remain after its conclusion, but the Company ventures to hope that the Imperial Russian Legation at Teheran will assist the Company in their negotia- ■■ tions with the Persian Government as far as that can be done unofficially. In conclusion I beg to ,state that a Russian translation of the present letter, including all enclosures, could be f urn i shed 0famished nvithin a few days, if such a translation should be found desirable. ♦ I have, &amp;c., (Signed) A.

Mr. Pagenkopf, the permanent representative of the company here, visited the embassy this morning and spoke to a member of my staff. He said that conversations had taken place with M. de Klemm, the official in charge of Persian questions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but that very little progress had been made. He indicated, in fact, that the conversations had been of a purely general character and had only touched on the question of the best method of improving the telegraphic service in Northern Persia without entering into any details.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer to your letter of the 9th ultimo, stating that your company have received from the Russian Government a request that they will submit suggestions for the repair, maintenance, and working of certain telegraph lines within the Russian sphere of influence in Persia, including those from Tehran to Khanikin and Tehran to Meshed, whence they deduce the conclusion that the control of these routes is, or will eventually be, vested in the Russian Government. With regard to the point thus raised, I am to state, for the confidential information of your board, that, at the time of the negotiations which resulted in the Anglo-Russian agreement, it appeared both to His Majesty’s and to the Russian Government desirable, in view of the new situation which would be created in Persia by the signature of that instrument, that neither Government should continue to control telegraph lines lying within the sphere of influence assigned to the other. An arrangement was accordingly concluded in 1907 whereby the control of the Tehran-Meshed line, at present exercised by Great Britain, should pass to Russia, and that of the Khaf-Nasratabad section of the Meshed-Seistan line (i.e., that portion of the line which lies within the British sphere) should be transferred to Great Britain. It was further agreed that the assent of the Persian Government to this arrange ment should be obtained, but this stipulation has not yet been carried out, because, in the judgment of the two Governments, an opportune moment for making the necessary communication has not yet arrived. . As regards the Tehran-Khanikin line, I am to transmit to you herewith a summary of the various arrangements which have from time to time been concluded respecting this concession,* and to inform you that in 1907 the Russian Government formally assented to a proposal of His Majesty’s Government for the cession to Russia of tliG hitherto unexercised right of Great Britain to control the line^ in return for certain important advantages in connection with the renewal of other British telegraph concessions. . „ , ^ ^ . It has not yet been thought desirable to inform the Persian Government oi this arrangement, though it is intended to do so when a suitable opportunity occurs. f am to point out to you that, as article 3 of the Anglo-Russian arrangement concerning Persia provides for the maintenance of all existing concessions m both the British and Russian spheres of influence, the interests of your company are in no way injured by the agreement above referred to. _ . I am to add that, as it was, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, necessary to obtain the consent of the Russian Government to the communication of the above facts to your company, some delay in the matter has been inevitable. I am, &amp;c.

Your Excellency should remind the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs of the wish expressed in the aide-memoire handed to Mr. O’Beirne on the 2nd June last, that no communication should be made to the Company on this subject till the interdepart mental correspondence then taking place in St. Petersburgh respecting the general question of Persian telegraphs was complete, and should point out to him that, in view of the request which has now been addressed to the Company, and the inference which they have drawn from it, it would appear undesirable further to conceal from them the true state of the case. You should therefore suggest that the terms of the arrangement of the 31st August, 1907, should be communicated to the Company confidentially without further delay, and that this might be done in a letter from this department to the Company’s office in London.

If we refuse we must give our reason, and to mention exchange of lines now would ensure unfavourable attitude of assembly towards our Arabistan convention. On the other band, Russian Govern ment, when it is informed that we propose to comply with request of Persian telegraphs, will presumably revert to the question of exchange, which has been slumbering. Apart from Arabistan convention, it would be well, in my opinion, to postpone exchange negotiations until Persian feeling is better disposed towards Russia. Withdrawal of Kasvin force would perhaps give us most favourable opportunity for pressing the question. I quite understand Sir A. Nicolson’s objection (see his telegram No. 296) to urging once more postponement of exchange if the only ground were interests of Arabistan convention, but could we not inform Russian Government that, in my opinion, moment for starting exchange negotiations is inopportune, and that we therefore propose to undertake erection of Shahrud line, which will take about six weeks ?

His Majesty’s Embassy would desire to inquire of the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs if it has any objection to the step which the Indo-European Telegraph Department has taken, it being, of course, clearly understood that the right above mentioned would be waived in the event of the telegraph lines being extended into the Russian sphere. ^ ^ In connection with the question of Persian telegraphs, His Majesty s^ Embassy would further wish to inform the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs that it^ is quite possible that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs will urge on the Indo-European Telegraph Department to proceed to the construction of a second line to Shahrud. It might be undesirable in the present stage of the negotiations regarding the Arabistan telegraph lines to meet this request, if it were made, by a direct refusal, as thereby the negotiations might be jeopardized. His Majesty s Embassy would therefore be glad to know if the Imperial Ministry for I oreign Affairs would wish the Indo-European Telegraph Department to undertake preliminary work, which could be abandoned when the negotiations as to the Arabistan telegraph lines were completed. ^ . His Majesty’s Embassy would be grateful if the Imperial Ministry for foreign Affairs would kindly give a reply at its earliest convenience.

In reply, I am to state that Sir E. Grey is of opinion that if the Russian Government are, as has been stated, really anxious for the erection of the addi tional wire, it will be an inducement to them to hasten on the exchange of the two lines. Moreover, tne erec tion of the wire in question must undoubtedly be re garded as more than the maintenance of the existing concessions and he, therefore, considers that the sub ject Secretary of State, India Office.(1955/OS) subject should remain In abeyance until the questions of the exchange of the telegraph lines and of the dura tion of our concessions have been settled. It will then he possible for the Russian Government themselves to erect the second wire. Sir E.

O *7 O i &lt;LJtL l In July 1907 the Persian Minister reported to the Director of Telegraphs that his Govern ment had sanctioned this work being carried out, saying that the material required would be obtained from Russia, though, but for the greater distance, it would have been far preferable to obtain the stores from India. He added that his Government would be prepared to pay all expenses of construction, which he hoped would not amount to a very high figure, in April last tie' Director telegraphed that the necessary material had arrived, and the Persian Telegraph Administration was pressing him to complete the work. 217ft. 1.2308. 500.—12/1907. a i 1^ . §• ] * M% .1 work. On this I telegraphed to the Director asking him if the Persian Telegraph Administration would advance the funds necessary to pay all charges for carry ing out the work. On the 16th November the Director telegraphed that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs can provide funds and was asking that the erection of the wire should be commenced. In reply to an inquiry from me the Director telegraphed that it was proposed to carry out the distribution of the material during the winter months, and to erect the wire in March next, and that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs had agreed to this arrangement. no particular desire for this second wire, but that the Russians are anxious to obtain it for their own purposes. It appears to me that if the Persian Telegraph Adminis tration can supply the necessary funds, which they report they can do, it only remains for the Indo-European Tele graph Department to put up the wire in the way that has been proposed. A refusal to have anything to do with the work would probably' make the Persian Minister ask far Russian assistance to complete it. the action the Director of Telegraphs may be told to take in the matter.

I OBSERVE in the Confidential Print, copy of a communication which yon addressed to the Russian Ambassador in London on the subject of the proposed construction of a second wire from Tehran to Shahrud. In that communication you stated that His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to give credit to the reports which had reached me. I venture to state, in justification of the communications which I thought it my duty to make to you on the subject, that the evidence before me was as follows:— 1. Mr. Barker had received a direct request from the Persian Telegraph Administration to undertake the construction of the second wire. 2. The material was ordered and paid for by a draft on Baku to the amount of 14,000 roubles. 3. The Russian Legation had addressed a note to the Persian Government, the substance of which is as follows :— “ As there is no proper telegraph line from Tehran to Shahrud this causes great inconvenience. It is requested that orders should be given to the Director of Telegraphs to add a new wire, and on our part every kind of assistance will be given.” This note, which reached me from a secret source, was shown by the Ala-es- Sultaneh to Abbas Kuli Khan on the 11th instant. 4. The Persian Government is quite unable to make payments even for the most necessary expenditure, and the revenues of the Telegraph Administration are pledged to us as security for the payment of interest on the English loan, which payments, as you are aware, are long overdue. 5. The construction of a second wire to Shahrud is of no benefit whatever to the Persian Administration, but is solely for the convenience of the Russian Legation. 6. The Minister of Telegraphs has recently made a large loan (60,000/.) from the Russian Bank, and consequently if he made the payments himself must have made them out of borrowed money. 7. The Persian Government denies categorically that it sanctioned any expenditure whatever on new telegraph construction. Finally, I venture to remind you that (as reported in my despatch No. 173 of the Uth ultimo) M. de Hart wig, in conversation with me, has stated that he asked for the construction of the second wire, although he denied that any loan was specifically made for that purpose. Although I now learn that this evidence was not regarded by His Majesty’s Government as convincing, I trust that on consideration it will present a sufficient appearance of probability to justify its communication to your Department. I have since learnt from Mr. Barker that the telegraph material cannot be delivered by the manufacturers in Baku till the end of September, and that he has not yet received authority from the India Office to undertake the work. I venture to observe that the stipulation inserted by the Russian Government in the draft Arrangement as to the exchange of lines, namely, that this is only to take place with the consent of the Persian Government, may have serious consequences, although it would not be desirable to raise any objections to it. The Russian Legation is certainly in a position to exercise a strong though clandestine influence on the decisions of the Persian Government, of which influence, 1 would beg to submit, the circumstances above detailed offer a somewhat striking instance. The Russian Legation denies, no doubt with truth, that a loan was made for the purpose of con structing the additional wire, and yet the construction was ordered and paid for by the Persian authorities, although they had absolutely no interest in the construction in question, and are in the last stage of financial embarrassment, and the evidence of Russian intervention in the matter is not such as to carry conviction.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received September 3.) -A ’ 173.) ^ Q i r» 0115 ( Gulahek, August 11, 1907. ^ 1 rs despatch No. lo4 of the 13th July I had the honour lo inform you that the Persian Telegraph Department had made proposals to the Indo-European Telegraph Department with a view to the continuation of the Seistan telegraph line and the construction of a second wire from Tehran to Shahrud As you will remember, I was instructed to make certain proposals with a view to the construction of the Seistan continuation by English officials and with the material stored al Robat. I suggested that such a proposal might be construed by Russia as an infraction of^ the status quo. You, sir, concurred in this view, and I duly informed M. de Hartwig that we would not for the present accept the Persian offers. In view, however, of the information which had reached me from confidential sources as to the origin and object of the Persian proposals, I ventured to express the hope that a friendly communication might be made to the Russian Gro^ernmeni informing them of our refusal to comply with the Persian proposal, and proposing that both parties might observe the status quo pending a definitive arrangement. My reasons for making such a suggestion were that the Russian Minister was, in all probability, ignorant of the alleged proceeding of the Russian Bank, which takes its orders directly through M. Gfrube from the Minister of Finance, and even if he were conversant with the matter, my instructions do not permit of my entering into any sort of negotiation with the Russian Legation. It was, however, evidently necessary to,preclude the possibility of a renewal of the circumstances under which the Meshed-Seistan line was forcibly seized by Russia after negotiations with England had begun on the plea that it had been constructed at her own expense, and it was equally evident that, as long as the Seistan telegraph office was in Russian occupation, the continuation of the line would be in Russian hands, at least so far as concerned one end of it. Having referred the matter to you, Sir, I thought it would be only fair to M. de Hartwig to inform him (on the 2dth July) of the rumours which had reached me. As I anticipated, he denied all knowledge of an advance by the Russian Bank to the Minister of Telegraphs for the purpose of constructing the Seistan continuation, and 1 informed you accordingly. ,, On the oth August M. de Hartwig called on me and informed me that he had heard from St. Petersburgh that I had complained of his conduct in sanctioning an advance by the Russian Bank for the purpose of constructing a telegraph line in Seistan. He said he had made inquiries from the Russian Bank and that no advance whatever had been made for that purpose. Of this he was quite positive, and he was at a loss to understand how such an impression could have arisen. 1 said that I had not been honoured by you, Sir, with any communication whatever on the subject, but that 1 would ask for information. YAu were good enough to inform me, at my request, of the nature; of the communi cation made by you ten days before to the Russian Government, and I hastened to explain to M. de Hartwig that no complaint had been made against him. The information which had reached me, although it was not such as could be quoted, or could be regarded as absolutely convincing, was of a nature to give rise to some anxiety as to the future, and 1 accordingly requested Abbas Kuli Khan to warn the Atabek against the responsibility he would incur should the telegraph line in Seistan be allowed to fall, during his tenure of office, into Russian hands, on the ground that it had been constructed with Russian money. At his Highness’ request a similar communication was made to the Ala-es-Sultaneh, and 1 have the honour to transmit herewith Memoranda by Abbas Kuli Khan as to the answers returned by these statesmen. You, Sir, will observe that they have both given positive assurances that nothing of the kind will be allowed to occur. I propose, unless otherwise instructed, to object to the construction of the Seistan continuation, as long as the Nasratabad office is in Russian hands, and until His [2633 c—2]Majesty’s Government is satisfied as to the conditions under which it is constructed. So far there are no sio’ns that the work is being begun. . ’ With regard to the second wire to Shahrud, the Russian Telegraph Departmen has informed Mr Barker that they will themselves provide the material, and I learn Iron, other sources that the Russia^ Legation has officially assured the Persian Government that it will afford the necessary assistance, and that as a mattei of tact . ,000 msulatois have already been ordered from Baku and paid for by the Persian felegrapj^ Department^art . informed me that in view 0 f the great delay which took place in tf transmission of his messages to St. Petersburgh, which are sent for economy s sake , p Shahrud. he had requested the Persian Government to consent to the construction of a second wire to Shahrud, to be at the disposal ot the Russian Legation. I have since learnt that the Indo-European Telegraph Company, whose line passes through Warsaw, made an arrangement some months ago with the Russian Government according to which the rates from Tehran to St. Petersburgh would be the same via Odessa as they are now via Shahrud and the Caspian. M, de Hartwig, however, does not appear to have received any information as to this arrangement, and his messages continue to be sent, as heretofore, vift, Shahrud, although this entails some delay. A possible reason tor this course may be that the Armemian employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Company are in the habit of selling the text of telegrams dispatched by the Company s line, and greater security might be obtained by using an exclusively Russian wire. I have been unable to trace any official communication of the Russian Legation with regard to the Seistan line, and the recent advance_ of the Russian Bank to the Sepahdar was no doubt unaccompanied by any express stipulations as to telegraph con struction. I understand, however, that the telegraph business is in the hands of M Passek, who is on close terms of intimacy with the Sepahdar, and who seems to cairy on a separate branch of diplomatic business. In any case, I trust it is now impossible for them, directly or indirectly, to obtain control over the projected hne m Seistan, as the matter has become public, and, as in the somewhat similar case of the advance o the Hashmet-ul-Mulk, there would be an outcry in the Assembly which would greatly embarrass the Government, should it acquiesce in such a surrender. In the meantime, the situation on the two lines is as follows : The Meshed-Seistan line is in the hands of the Russians, who exercise an active control over every part or it, and have a large number of telegraphists and other officials stationed at different pom s along the line. They can, and do, stop telegrams or tap the line. Without their leave Persians appear to be unable to send any telegrams to Tehran, and British officials are allowed the use of the line for about one or two hours daily. As, hosvever, the Ime ij&gt; subject to constant interruptions, the English telegraphist employed has to wait till after nightfall before he can have free use of the line. The Meshed-Tehran line is maintained in good order at the expense and under the supervision of the English Telegraph Department. There are no permanent English telegraphists stationed on the line. The net loss is about 1,000 dollars a-year, and the number of messages sent by English^ officials along it is very small. On the other hand the Russians have free and exclusive use of the line as often as they require it both for messages to Meshed, and, vi&amp; Shahrud, to Russia. AVhen the second wire is put up it will be for the exclusive use of the Russian Legation. The interruptions of which comnlaint is made are mainly due to the fact that the Persian soldiers in the neighbourhood of Tehran are in the habit of cutting down the posts and selling them for^fire-wood. The Russians are thus at the expense and under the control of British officials provided with a telegraphic line in good working order, by which they can communicate with Meshed and Russia, while there can be no^ question of any political control accruing to Great Britain from the yearly visit ot inspection of the sing e British telegraph official employed. I may observe that the Russian Legation (besides the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which has recently offered a heavy reduction in the rate) can communicate with Russia via Kazvin Resht and Astara. But this line, though constructed by Russians, on Persian account, is hardly ever to be depended upon. The Shahrud route is evidently regarded as the safest and most dependable. &lt; ' . . . Under these circumstances it is not surprising if the Russians should hesitate to accept the proposed exchange, as the present arrangement must be eminently satis factory to them.

I HAD yesterday afternoon an interview with the Atabek-i-Azam in his country ^use at Kaitarieh, and asked him about the project of the extension of the telegraph N from Nasratabad to Kuh-i-Malik Siah. His Highness asked the Sepahdar^ who —ns standing in the garden, whether he knew anything about the project. The h* pahdar replied that some time ago he received instructions from the Ministry of the Interior to make an estimate of the cost of the construction of the line in question, but so far no steps had been taken by him in the matter. The Atabek promised me to refer to his archives and give me the details of the project, if any. His Highness also asked me to give necessary assurances on his behalf to His Majesty’s Minister that he will not allow the line, if constructed, to fall into the hands of the Russians like the Meshed-Seistan line, which wmuld not have been allowed to be controlled by them if he had been in office at the time. At the conclusion of the conversation the Atabek remarked that the present financial position of Persia could not allow any public w r orks such as the construction of new telegraph lines.

His Highness renewed the assurances contained in my Memorandum of the 19th instant, and added that he had neither said nor written a word to the Director of Telegraphs about the project, and that when the Russians took possession of the Meshed-Seistan line, the National Assembly did not exist, and it is not likely that the Assembly should allow the line to fall into the hands of the Russians if constructed. His Highness also asked the Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh to refer to the archives of the Ministry of the Interior and see whether such an order has been given to the Sepahdar by his predecessor in office. This morning I saw the Foreign Minister and informed him of what passed between the Atabek and myself on the subject.

In view of present incident, we venture with the greatest respect again to suggest that it is of utmost importance that the question of maintenance of status quo in the -Persian Gulf, including quarantine arrangements, should form integral part of Convention with Russia. We have now seen M. Isvolski’s objections to mention of Gulf, as reported m Nicolson’s telegram of the 24th June, and we are unable to recognise their special^ force, for they would apply as strongly to mention of zone assigned to Russia, in which other nations have as large if not larger, interests than in the Gulf. British and Indian interests are already paramount in the Gulf, and if construction of lower section of Bagdad railway is to form an object of British policy, it is now more important *than ever to maintain our existing rights and interests there. Even at the last moment we would venture to point out that our con- 'ciliatory attitude towards Russia as regards Tibet and Afghanistan, and the fact that we have recognised as her sphere of interests most of Persia, while retaining m our sphere a very small area, most of which is incapable of commercial or industrial development, and that we voluntarily renounce the strong political position which we had secured at Tehran and elsewhere owing to action of popular party, would appear to entitle us to require from her full recognition of our vital interests in the Gulf, especially as we now coniine these to the coast only by drawing our line from Bunder Abbas. Russian refusal to recognise our interests in this matter, coupled with rumours from German source here that Persian Majlis is considering concession of Khanikin railway to Germany, and report that a start is being made on Bagdad- Khanikm line, would lead us to fear secret understanding with Germany tending to undermine our position in the Gulf and at Bagdad, and clearing up of situation might be (? far more) to our advantage.V / Minute Paper.

[2561 3] * India Office, July 4, 1907.Note on the renewal of the British Telegraph Conventions in Persia. 26JUN 907 C] A Y^ith reference to my Memorandum, dated the 25th April last, on the renewal of the British Telegraph Con ventions in Persia, I have to report that I have heard from the Director of Telegraphs at Teheran that the British Minister there considers that it would probably be of considerable assistance to him towards obtaining the renewal that is desired, if the right of obtaining compensation for wilful damage to the Departmental telegraph lines in Persia from the Persian Government was given up. In the Telegraph Convention of 2nd December, 1372, Clause XII, it is laid down that 'In case of any wilful damage to the line, the n expense of repairing the same shall be defrayed by the 'Persian Government'. It appears that the payment of the sums due for compensation for wilful damage to the lines is obtained, if possible, from the local Persian authorities of the district where the damage takes place. If the payments cannot be obtained by the Department locally, the British Minister is then called on to deduct them from the subsidy paid to the Persian Government, knov/n as the Jask Royalty. In the ten years ending with the year 1905-06 the Persian Government have paid for wilful damage on an average per annum Rs.2,640 (£176) of which Rs.613 (£ 4 l) were paid locally, and the balance Rs.2,027 (£135) deducted from the Bask Royalty. The greater part of the damage done is in the Spring and Autumn when the nomad tribes are moving up to and from their Summer quarters. The nomads damage the linesli ne S/a n d the inhabitants of the villages near are called on to pay the fines. It is believed that the knowledge that fines have to be paid incites the nomads to damage the lines, and thereby punish villages with which they are unfriendly. 2 ' This system of claiming compensation therefore leads to much correspondence between the local Persian authori ties and telegraph officers y and to villages being fined for offences they are not responsible for,which naturally leads to local ill-feeling against the Telegraph Department. Vvhen local compensation is not obtainable, the cases have to be reported to headquarters at Teheran, and this entails more correspondence and reports. Pinally the British Minister has to take up the cases with the Persian Government, and eventually has the unpleasing duty of deducting from the Jask Royalty the amount of compensation for wilful damage that remains unpaid. As I have pointed out, we obtain on an average £17 6 per annum in the way of compensation, and it would appear that the collection of this comparatively small sum causes so much trouble and controversy, both local^and at Teheran, that the British Minister considers it would be advisable to abrogate our right to compensation. The Director of Telegraphs recommends the same course, and there is no doubt that the Persian Govern ment would very gladly see the right to compensation annulled. It might happen, however, that there might be civil or military disorders in Persia, during which the telegraph lines might suffer serious and extensive damage, and therefore it would be well to retain our right to claim compensation in such cases. With a view to obtaining a renewal of the Telegraph Conventions the Persian Government might be informed, if this renewal i ■■ C j j i .renewal was granted, that the Indo-European Telegraph Department would at once he instructed to put forward no claims for com pensation for acts of ordinary wilful damage to the telegraph lines, the Persian Government on their side undertaking to make their local officials do all in their power towards the safe maintenance of the lines. This arrangement would he, it seems to me, all that the British Minister at Teheran desires, and the Telegraph Department could very well hear the small loss that is entailed hy it, if it helps to bring about a renewal of its telegraph concessions for a further term of twenty years..

IN accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your telegram No.*~90 of the 21st instant, I handed yesterday to M. Isvolsky an aide-memoire, of which I have the honour to inclose a copy, relative to the question of the prolongation for twenty years of the Concessions of certain British telegraph lines in Persia. His Excellency said that he would look into the matter and give me a reply later. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. NICOLSON. Inclosure in No. 1. Aide-me'moire communicated by Sir A. Nicolson to M. Isvolsky. HIS Majesty’s Embassy had the honour to receive the aide-memoire dated the 16th (29th) May, in which the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs raised certain objections to an application being now made to the Persian Government for the prolongation for twenty years of the Concessions of the telegraph lines from Tehran to Bushire, from Task to Gwaddur, and of the Central Persian telegraph line to Robat. His Majesty’s Embassy would beg leave to state that His Majesty’s Government always considered that the maintenance of existing Concessions, as provided for in Article III of the draft Convention, implied their renewal if the Persian Government agreed thereto, and this view His Majesty’s Government still maintain in principle. His Majesty’s Embassy is, however, in a position to make the following proposal as a solution of the difficulty, viz., that the Imperial Russian Government should not object to the renewal of the above-mentioned Concessions, and in return His^Majesty’s Government would surrender to the Imperial Russian Government their rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line. _ .. In order to avoid introducing questions relative to these telegraph lines into discussions on the draft Convention, His Majesty s Embassy is authorized to piopose to the Imperial Russian Government that the seat of the negotiations respecting the telegraph questions might be conveniently transferred to London, and, if the Impenal Government see no objection, that the Russian Ambassador in London be authorized to conduct them. These negotiations could be carried on concurrently with those at St. Petersburgh respecting the draft Convention, in order that both may be simultaneously concluded.

You should explain this clearly to the Russian Government, but you can propose, as a solution of the present difficulty, that they should not object to the renewal of our Telegraph Concessions in return for a surrender to them of our rights over the Tehran- Khanikin line. You should explain that, on the expiry of our Telegraph Concessions, the German Government would probably endeavour to obtain control of the telegraph line from Khanikin to Tehran, and eventually to the Indian frontier. In order to avoid complications which might arise from introducing questions relating to telegraph lines into the discussions on the draft Convention, you should further propose to the Russian Government that, if they have no objection to such a course, the seat of the negotiations respecting telegraph questions might he con veniently transferred to London, and Count Benckendorff authorized to conduct them.

I concur in Mr. Morley's view that for the reasons given in this memorandum, a settlement on the lines suggested in the. . letterletter from this Department of the 1st in stant would he undesirable, and I have to request you to make a communication to the Russian Government inviting them to with draw their objection to the renewal of the concessions in question in return for a surrender by His Majesty’s Government of their rigilts over the Tehran-Khanikin line, You should explain to them that, as shown in Mr. Kirk's memorandum of April 25th, on the expiry of the present telegraph con cessions of the Indo-European Department, the German Government would probably en deavour to obtain control of the telegraph line from Khanikin to Tehran and eventu ally to the Indian frontier..&amp;J4.

The foreign Office puts forward a suggestion that, in order to meet Russian objections,His Majesty's Government should agree, il the contracts of the Indo-European Telegraph Department can be renewed in Persia, to renounce the right to work the section of the Depart ment’s lines, which lies within the proposed Russian sphere i.e. that betv/een Teheran and Isfahan)» the expiration o_l the present concession. Should this line be made over in the manner proposed it would- without doubt come under the complete con trol of the Russian Government, withwith the result that neither the British nor the Indian Government could communicate 'by telegraph with the British Minister at Teheran except over Russian telegraph lines. It appears to me this is a very serious objection to making an agreement of the kind. Rrom a telegraph point of view the giving up of the line from Teheran to Isfahan would he a mistake as the Teheran-Bushire and the Central Persia lines meet at Ardistan, and if the section of line from Ardistan to Isfahan was taken away from the Indo- European Telegraph Department the connection between the two main lines would be lost. Sir C.Spring-Rice in his telegram of the olst. ultimo to the Foreign Office reports that he hears the presdener Bank wants to arrange for telegraph connection from Constantinople through Persia to India. With reference to this connection I would invite attention to the fifth .paragraph of my note of the 25th A ril last which is below, in which it is shewn, how, if the present telegraph con cessions of the Indo-European Telegraph Department are hot 6 6entire. renewed, the (ferman Government may chka^?m the control of the telegraph line from the Turkish frontier at Khanikin to the Indian frontier at Robat. It might be that if this 'were brought to the knowledge of the Russian Government, and if at the same time the British Government were to agree to make over its rights over the Khanikin-Teheran section to the Russian Government, the latter Government might waive its present objections to the renewal that is wanted of the concessions of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Persia.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 17 7 53. and addx-ess— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

The Memorandum points out that proposed steps of His Majesty’s Government would introduce considerable changes in existing state of things in Persia as regards rights acquired by England and Russia respectively. Two of the lines would pass through provinces situated in the proposed Russian sphere. Memorandum considers, therefore, that it would he just, in order not to depart from understanding established at commencement of negotiations, nop to introduce during discussions any change in the rights of the two parties when, as in present case, these rights are evidently in close relationship with the present negotiations. ^ ° Minister for Eoreign Affairs clearly wished to avoid my discussing the Memo randum at our interview, as he merely handed it to me saying that it contained some observations on the letter which I had written to him. I shall have an opportunity to go into the matter with him very shortly when we discuss small amendments (merely drafting amendments, he assured me) which he wishes introduced into Article I, Article II, Article III, Article IY of draft Convention, as in Article III there is a clause as to maintenance of existing Concessions. I should he grateful for your views as to the language I should hold, and as to whether I should insist on our right to propose the prolongation at the present moment. I should like also to know if the moment is opportune for proposing the prolongation to the Persian Government, and whether Persian Assembly would raise no difficulties.

IN Mr. Grant Duff’s despatch No. 173 of the 22nd June, 1906, he had the honour to transmit an agreement between the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Persian Government, prolonging the Concession held by the Company for twenty years in consideration of an advance to the Persian Government of 40,000Z. The Concession of the Company runs, therefore, to 1945. When in 1891 the Company obtained the renewal of its Concession from 1905 to 1925, the Department also applied to the Persian Government for a similar renewal. The Persian Government agreed to this, and the Concessions of 1868 and 1872 were renewed np to 1925. Since then the Department has obtained the Concession for the Central Persian line, which remains in force until the 1st January, 1925, or for such longer time as the debt due by Persia for the construction of the line remains unpaid. As matters now stand, the Company which is, as you are aware, under Russian protection, has a Concession for a line from the west to Tehran running until 1945; while the Department’s Concession for their lines, which connect Tehran with Bushire and India, expires in 1925. The Department’s lines run partly through the district which is said to be reserved for Russian enterprise, and I ventured to telegraph to you, Sir, in order to suggest that, if negotiations are taking place in St. Petersburgh on the subject of Anglo-Russian relations in Persia, it might be convenient if the Russian Government were informed that it is the intention of the British Government to apply for the extension of the telegraph Concession of the Indian Telegraph Department. The moment is an opportune one for an application, as the Persian Government is in much want of funds ; but I have not mentioned the subject here in the absence of recent information as to what arrangements, if any, are being made with Russia. I have &amp;c. (Signed) ’ CECIL SPRING-RICE. [2474 n * 7 .Memorandum on the renewal of the British Telegraph Conventionlwith Persia. On the 16th March last I wrote to the Director of Telegraphs at Teheran telling him that the Indo- European Telegraph Company had arranged in June 1906 with the Persian Government that the term of its Telegraph concession, which ran to 1925, should he extended for a further period of 20 years up to 1945. I pointed out that in 1891, after this Company obtained the extension of its concession from 1905 to 1925, we also went to the Persian Government to have the British Telegraph con cessions renewed for the same period, and that this was duly arranged. He was instructed to remind the British Minister at Teheran of what had taken place regarding the renewal of the British concessions up to 1925, this action being taken in order that what happened on the last occasion of the renewal of the Company’s concession might not escape attention on this. 2 . prom the telegram of the 17th instant that has been received from the British Minister at Teheran it would appear that the present time may prove to be favourable for obtaining an extension of the British Tele graph concessions, as there would have to be a payment to make for their renewal,and money is very badly wanted by the Persian Government. In order to obtain the renewal of these concessions in 1892 a present of £5000 was made to the Shah, and a watch of the value of £500 was given1 to the Persian Prime Minister, this expenditure being debited to the Capital account of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. At the same time the Persian Minister of Telegraphs v/as made a K.C.I.E* for his ser vices in the matter. 3 , In 1891 we obtained the extension from 1905 to 1925 of the two following Conventions:- (1) the Convention dated 2nd April 1868 for the construction and working of the coast line from the Persian frontier near Gwadur to Jask. (2) the Convention of 2nd December 1872 for the working of the telegraph line from Teheran to Bushire. Since 1891 another Telegraph Convention has been entered into, dated 16th August 1901, for the construction and maintenance of the Central Persia line, practically a telegraph line from Teheran to Robat on the Indian frontier. This Convention remains in force until 1925, or for such longer period as the debt due by Persia for the construction of the line remains unpaid. 4 . It is necessary for the proper consideration of the British position as regards telegraphs in Persia to show what would happen if the extension of these three Conventions beyond 1925 cannot be arranged. Taking first the Jask Convention of 1868, its non-renewal would mean the loss to the Persian Government of an annual royalty of 3000 tomans, equivalent at present to about £500.% £500. The line v/ould he of no use to the Persian Govern ment, as it is a detached land line along the coast, and / / ' Vl&lt;v - is used as an alternative to a cable. The Persian Govern ment may therefore be expected to extend the concession for this line, as there is nothing to be gained by not doing so, and its non-renewal means a direct loss of revenue. Coming to the Convention of 1872 for the working of the Teheran Bushire line, should the renewal of it beyond 1925 not be granted, the Persian Govern ment would be forced under their agreements with the Indo- European Telegraph Company to hand over this section of line to the Company, and for doing this they would receive no payment nor compensation of any kind. It is therefore to the advantage of the Persian Government to renew the concession of the British Telegraph Department, if they can obtain a payment for doing so. It is also to the interest of the British Government that the con cession should be renewed, because the withdrawal of the British Department from this section of line would mean a loss of prestige and influence to the British Govern ment. At the same time, as the Company that would take over the line is in Persia under the official protection of the Russian Government, there would be an increase of Russian influence in a part of the country where previous ly British influence had prevailed. 5. The Convention of 1901 regarding the Central Persia line extends to 1925,or for such longer period as the Persian Government may take to pay off the debt for its construction. This debt under the arrangement con- tained in the Convention would be paid off in 33 3 years fromfrom the completion of the line, and as the line will he completed this year the debt would be cleared off in 1940. It is laid down in the Convention that in 1925, or later when the debt has been paid off, the Convention may if necessary be renewed or revised. It would seem therefore that if the Persian Government did not agree to the necessity of its renewal the Convention would come to an end, and the line would have to be handed over to that Government to be worked by the Persian Administration, or by any one that the Government chose to appoint. This freedom of action might possibly result in arrange ments being made that v/ould seriously affect British interests. To explain how this might be done it has to be borne in mind that the Convention of 1872 allows the Indo-European Telegraph Department to resume charge of the section of line between Teheran and Khanikin, a town i on the Persian frontier not far from Baghdad. This con cession would come to an end with the termination of the Convention of 1872 in 1925, and it does not become trans ferable to the Indo-European Telegraph Company under its agreements like the charge of the Teheran Bushire line does. This Company, recognising the value of the con cession, has obtained a document from the Persian Government in which it is told that there is no objection to the Company coming to an understanding with the British Government as to taking over and v/orking this sec ^ion of line. The document does not appear actually to bind the Persian Government to allow the transfer oi the line, if it took place, to remain in force for the term of the Company*©Company*s agreements that is up to 1945, so that should the British concession for the Teheran Bushire line come to an end in 1925, the concession for the working of the Teheran Khanikin section would aiJparently end at the same time, whether the British Department or the Company then possessed it. In this case in 1925 the Persian Government could dispose of the Teheran Khanikin line concession in any way they chose. It is known that the German Telegraph Administration has heen making inquiries regarding this line. It is possible that the Germans might obtain control of the line in 1925. It has been shewn that the British concession for the Central Persia line might be terminated at the same time, so that the Germans, even if they had to advance money to pay off any debt remaining on the Central Persia line, might obtain for themselves the concession for working this line also from that time. We should then have the line from Baghdad, through Teheran, to the Indian frontier at Robat being worked under German control, v/hich would be a very undesirable state of affairs as far as British interests are concerned. I have shewn that it would be to the interest of the Persian Government for financial reasons to renew the British concessions of 1868 and 1872, and that it is advisable in British interests that they should be renewed, as also the concession oi 1901 for the Cenoral Persia line. But we shall have to pay for these renewals, and the question is what should he paid. In 1391 we paidpaid £5000 to the Shah, and gave a present of the value of £500 to the Prime Minister, for the renewal of two concessions• If the grant of the renewal of these two concessions still rests entirely with the Shah, of which there would seem to he some doubt, since such matters may require the consent of his Parliament, similar amounts as on the last occasion might he offered for a renewal of the two concessions* Por the third concession relating to the Central Persia line we have under the Convention to pay one per cent on the capital expended on construction of the line subject to a minimum of £1000 per annum* When the account for the construction of the line is made up this one per cent will he more than £1000, though how much more it is impossible to say until the accounts are made up* Por the renewal of this concession we might anticipate the annual payment of £1000 to the Persian Government,and pay £10000 at once as an advance being the equivalent of ten annual payments* The difference between £1000 and the sum that one per cent on the capital cost of the line will amount to would also be paid yearly, to the Persian Government for the same time. The Indo-European Telegraph company advanced £40,000 for the late renewal of its concession to 1945, but this advance has to bear interest. I have proposed an advance of £10,000, but if a smaller advance should be accepted so much the better. 7. When the question of these renewals is raised with the Persian Government it might be pointed out that, as they have renewed the Company’s concession for 20 yeais,np it will be accoi ding to their previous custom if* they now renew the British Conventions for the same term, and that this is our reason for applying for them,It could be explained that the 1868 Convention provides the Persian Government with a royalty of 3000 tomans,and that the non renewal of the 1872 Convention would mean the handing over to the Indo-European Telegraph Company of the Teheran-Bushire line without payment of any kind. As to the Central Persia line it could be pointed out that it has been constructed, as shewn in the Convention relating to it, for an alternative line to the Teheran Bushire one, so that it is only reasonable and right that the Conventions for the two sections should have the same limit of time. As to the payments or advances to be made for these renewals it seems to me they will have to be arranged with reference to the authority in Persia who can no?/ sanction them. If this should prove to be the Shah alone the matter will probably be more easily carried out. 25th April 1907 .«&gt; \ 3 ^ In any farther communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 12389. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

You will observe that the inclosed Agreement and that regarding the Khanikin line (see my despatch No. 169 of the 21st instant) were both registered at the Russian Legation, which charged the Company 750 roubles for that service. The local Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Company informs me that when the Company first desired to commence operations in Persia, the then British Minister at Tehran entirely declined to assist them, hence the strange arrangement whereby a British Company is protected in Persia by the Russian Legation.

Should His Majesty’s Government come to such an understanding with the Indo- European Telegraph Company, the conditions under which the said line is to be worked will be regulated by Convention between the Company and the Persian Government. I am informed by the local Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Company that his Board have reason to believe that the German Government have designs on the Tehran-Khanikin line, and the inclosed Agreement has been made as a precaution. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) EVELYN GRANT DUPE. Inclosure in No. 1. Agreement between the Persian Government and Indo-European Telegraph Company. LE Gouvernement de Sa Majeste le Schali n’a aucune objection a ce que ITndo- European Telegraph Company s’entende avec le Gouvernement Britannique pour la reprise eventuelle de la section de Teheran a la frontiere Turque (Kanekine) de la ligne telegraphique qui fait Fobjet de la Convention convenue le 23 Novembre, 1865, entre le Gouvernement Persan et le Gouvernement Britannique. Dans le cas oil la reprise serait elfectuee, les conditions de Texploitation de la dite section seront reglees par une Convention a conclure entre le Gouvernement Persan et ITndo-European Telegraph Company.

Seal of Russian Legation, certifying authenticity of seals of Atabeg-i-Azam and Mushir-ed-Dowleh. (Signed) A. Baranovsky.ITote on Teheran Khanikin telegraph line. In the Times of 6th June 1906 there is under 'Foreign Intelligence’ 1 a telegram from Constantinople dated 30th May, which refers to German commercial designs in Persia, and makes mention of a German application for a railway concession from Kermanshah to Khanikin. Some time ago I heard that the German Telegraph Administration had been making inquiries from the Indo-European Telegraph Com pany regarding the telegraph line between Teheran and Khanikin on the Perso-Turkish frontier. Under Article XYI of our Telegraph Convention with Persia, dated 2nd December 1872, the Indo-European Telegraph Department cah resume charge at any time of the section of line from Teheran to Khanikin. This Convention has been renewed up to 31st January 1925. A few days ago the Managing Director of the Indo- European Telegraph Company informed me confidentially that his Company wus trying to obtain an extension of the period of their present telegraph concession from the Persian Government. This concession runs up to 1925. In trie ne gotiations with the Persian Government the Company have been told that if it could arrange for the-British Govern ment to cancel the clause in the Convention under whicn the charge of the Teheran Khanikin telegraph line could be i e- sumed, it would considerably facilitate the arriving at a COKPIDEUTIAD. ) favourablefavourable agreement for the desired extension of the con cession. In reply the Company pointed out that it would he against its own interests if this line came under any other control than British, and that it was quite satisfied with the arrangement as it stood. It is highly improhahle that the Persian authorities would have raised the question of the control of the Teheran Khanikin line, as they have done, had they not been asked to do so by some agency that the present arrangement does not suit. The inference appears to be that the Germans having obtained their Black Sea cable from Constanza to Constanti nople are contemplating extensions of telegraphs to the east as far as Teheran. 7th June 1906.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/108</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/108</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 3414/1906 Pt 5 'Telegraphs:- N.
