I considered it therefore very unfortunate you did not avail yourself of this valuable aid at your elbow. He could have well supplied you with the necessary explanation, without which the records, as read by you, were only prone to mislead. Major Macauley and Sir Henry Green thirteen years ago had in some measure the same idea as you have adopted, but further experience and acquaintance with the subject led them to modify those opi nions, and this' is what I have endeavoured fruitlessly, unluckily, to induce you to do also. I used the expression, leaning on Captain Sandeman advisedly,, because it appeared to me that you consorted with that Officer more than you did with those immediately about you, who were better versed in Khelat politics than he was; and you joined with him in considering arrangements with the Murree and Boogtee tribes, as of the first importance, instead of its being only a part of the general policy which should be followed in our con nection with the Khelat state. Captain Sandeman's management of the Punjab border, and his communications with the Hill subjects of the Khan, as they then existed, were ap proved of by Sir Henry Green, and their success met with the deserved approval of the Secretary of State and the Indian Government, But Sir Henry Green expressly stated that he would arrange with the Khan ; that was to be left to him. What I now object to iu Captain Sandeman's proceedings is, that he has gone beyond what he did in Sir Henry Green's time, and has, in his arrangements with the Murrees and Boogtees, showed a marked inclination to ignore the Khan and lower his authority, which will certainly not receive the approbation of Government. The quotation from Sir Henry Green's report, as adduced by you, is-another instance of how you adhere to an early formed idea,, without allowing subsequent circumstances to have their due weight with you. That advocacy at the time appeared just and proper, but it entirely ceased to be so when the Sirdars proved, by their further acts and behaviour, they were no longer deserving of it, and it was you alone who thought they ought to be any longer encouraged. This view you still cling to-, in spite of my repeatedly pointing out that it was no longer desirable. I never implied, nor did I mean, that it should be thought I intended to imply that you had not been actuated by a sense of duty. But I did expect that you would be open to reason, and that when the trouble was taken to explain the whole position in its true bearing, and that the course you were following was not approved by the authority under whom you were immediately serving, that you would accept the instructions you received and endeavour to act up to them ; not to* continue to oppose them. I have written clearly and plainly that I may not be misunderstood, and though this letter is also in a demi-official form, I desire it may also be considered official. Believe me, &amp;c.. W. L.
