His Majesty has decided upon India as being less likely to cause gossip and speculation than Syria or any other Middle Bast country. 2# Ibn Saud has asked me to arrange for the above mentioned to travel by air from Bahrein to India accompanied by doctor and four servants (eight persons in all) and he asks that the matter be treated as urgent. 5. Can you arrange for B.O.A.C, to provide accommodation for this party in the near future? Alternatively I suggest that the k.A.F. might like to provide transport m consideration for the many occasions on which their personnel have received help from Saudi Arabian authorities after forced landings in Saudi territory along the Persian Gulf.

Following is a repetition of my saying telegram No. 8 to Foreign Office, repeated to Bagdad;: Official account is now published in Saudi press of a plot against the Saudi Government by certain Sharifs of the family of Al Aun which has been the subject of police investigations for the past few weeks. Following is outline of the affair: The income-from certain wakfs of the^Aun in Hejaz is disputed among various members of the family, grandsons of # the late Sharifs of Aun. Funds were m charge of a certain Hassan Kutbikais, agent of the family. With his connivance, his assistant El Abid Ibn Hussein El Dhib stole the funds and distributed them amongst various Sharifs m and about•Eme# with the object of setting on foot a conspiracy to wrest the He 3 az from Ibn Saud and set up a Sharifian ruler. The principal conspirators were three brothers of the Aun family Abdul Hamid, Ali and Hassan. Five other Sharifs entered into the plot but three of these informed against the rest and all the conspirators were arrested. El Abid Ibn Hussein El Dhib and Abdul Hamid were condemned to death but Abdul Hamid s sentence was commuted to imprisonment. El Abid Ibn Hussein El Dhib has been executed and all the rest imprisoned for an unspecified period. Rumour went that Ibn Saud spared the life of Abdul Hamid to avoid offence to R-emaneife in Iraq. The general opinion is that the plot warTD^conceived and had no hope of success. One informant stated that the funds which were to finance the revolt amounted only 500 sovereigns.

IN my two despatches No. 66 of the 17th April and No. 70 of the 19th April, 1937, I had the honour to report to the Foreign Office on a society called “ The ^ Friends of the Hejaz,” which was alleged to have been formed in Egypt, I said it was doubtful whether any Hejazis resident in this country would venture to join a society aiming at the independence of the Hejaz, but admitted that Hejazis , had a grievance, in that the income from the pilgrimage, which was for centuries a perquisite of the Hejaz, now has to support the whole of Saudi Arabia. In a later despatch, No. 91 of the 8th May, 1937, I reported the issue of a proclamation in which Ibn Saud invited his subjects to return to religion and uttered strong criticisms against “modernisation” and ‘‘civilisation.” In the Jedda report for May 1937 there appeared this comment:— “ This proclamation came as something of a surprise, as nothing had been heard of any movement for reform, and enquiries made since have discovered little to justify Ibn Saud’s alarm. The young Syrians, and the few Saudis who have been educated in Egypt, may sigh for the cinema and stronger drinks than pink lemonade; the Italian-trained pilots are said to give themselves European airs; and one rich young merchant uses his position as an honorary consul to frequent places where greater freedom of speech and refreshment is possible than in any Saudi house; but it doesn’t amount to much.” 2. The rich young merchant in question is Muhammad Ali Riza, son of the y late Haji Abdullah, Kaimakam of Jedda. At a recent party at a foreign Legation | he drank too much, as he usully does on sucli occasions, and in conversation with Mr. Ousman, a member of the Legation staff; he spoke strongly against Ibn Saud and the Saudi Government. He professes to believe that the death of the' Amir Khalid, which I reported in my despatch No. 64, dated the 4th April, was not the result of an accident, though he has nothing but suspicion upon which to base such a conclusion. He has a private grievance, in that he believes that Ibn Saud shortened Haii Abdullah’s life. It is true that Haji Abdullah was much harassed by his official duties, which he would gladly have laid down if Ibn Saud would have let him, but he had already held the same position, under compulsion, under King Husain, and my own memories go back to the trials he suffered under that monument of unreason and unaccountability. Muhammad All Riza professes to belong to some sort of society the members of which, he says, intend to meet in Egypt this summer ‘‘ to see what can be done.” They have no intention, he states, of doing anything during the life-time of Ibn Saud, so the young men may be middle-aged before the time for action comes, since Ibn Saud is not more than 60 and shows no signs of failing powers. Muhammad Ali Riza complains of the financial exploitation of the Hejaz by the Central ^ Government, and indicates that the party to which he belongs have a separatist policy. He claims that the movement has the sympathy of Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, the Minister of Finance, who would be useful, he suggests, because of the large fortune he has accumulated. He also claims as supporters the King’s third son, Muhammad, and Fuad Bey Hamza, but describes Sheikh Yusuf Yasin / as very hostile. He adds that he and his friends expect to find Great Britain in favour of the established regime and, therefore, strongly opposed to their ^ movement. I should explain that Mr. Ousman had nothing to do but listen to this outpouring, Muhammad Ali Riza being too drunk to expect either approval or opposition. 3. The statements made by Muhammad Ali Riza were confused and vague. It is not to be supposed that the Hejazis would welcome a Najdi like Sheikh [305 q—3] :2 Abdullah Sulaiman as one of their leaders, nor is it probable that he and Fuad Bey would work together in such a movement. A much more likely sympathiser is Muhammad Tawil, Director of Customs in King Husain’s time, and at present director (under compulsion) of the new Nejd Motor Transport Company, yet his name was not mentioned. Nevertheless, the statements are of interest as yoicmg Hejazi dissatisfaction at Saudi rule, and as referring definitely to discussions to take place in Egypt, though no hint of the identity or of the number of the other malcontents was given. I do not think it likely that they are numerous or important, and I attribute Muhammad Ali Riza’s statements largely to the bragging of a rather conceited young man, whose inheritecl wealth would enable him to play a much larger part in a world not dominated by the shadow of Ibn Baud. n j • 4. The conspirators, if they deserve this .name, are probably well advised to wait for the death of Ibn Baud. His contempt for the Hejazi and his intention to stand no nonsense from them are well known : they were expressed in a speech at Mecca which I reported in paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 91, dated the 8th May, 1937. Whatever the grievances of the Hejaz or of any other part of the country, no one expects that a revolt will be ventured upon in the lifetime of Ibn Baud. On the other hand, both Arab tradition and the particular circum stances of the case suggest that the succession may be disputed at Ibn Baud’s death. If the Arab custom has its advantages, under which the best man in the ruling family tends to secure the rule, it has a drawback in that the succession is always liable to be contested. Ibn Baud has tried to secure the succession by appointing the Amir Baud, his eldest surviving son, as his successor, and requiring the oath of allegiance to be taken to him as heir apparent. This is a compromise : it is not in conformity with Arab custom, yet it does not recognise the principle of primogeniture, since Ibn Baud’s eldest son, Turki, who died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, left a son, Faisal, who is still alive. . 5. There is always much gossip about alleged differences between the sons of Ibn Baud and the possibility of their quarrelling after their father’s death. The Amir Faisal, for instance, is represented as being jealous of his eldest brother, Baud, and as being not only cleverer but more popular because of his superiority as a warrior and a horseman. But it is from the third son, Muhammad, that opposition is considered to be most likely to come. During his stay in Riyadh last summer, Mr. Ousman found that the Amir Muhammad was considered the most ambitious and unruly of all the princes, and it is suggestive that Muhammad Ali Riza should mention him as a sympathiser. The name of the Amir Muhammad is usually associated with that of his next brother, Khalid. Not only are they full brothers, but among the older members of the family they are supposed to be the favourites of Ibn Baud, as the sons of his Queen, Jauhara, whose death in 1918 is known to have caused the King deep sorrow. It is known that Muhammad shows jealousy towards Baud and tries to compete with him in magnificence and generosity, and at the time of tlie Athlone visit to Riyadh Mr. Gault noticed that he seemed to resent being asked by Baud to do anything, and to sulk at having to help organise a tribal dance, whereas the other Amirs took part with no sign of dissatisfaction. Possibly the King’s object in sending Muhammad to England with the Amir Baud for the Coronation was the establish ment of better relations between them. 6. It is not only from rival brothers that opposition to the succession might perhaps come. The hostility of the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhammad, whose death occurred a month ago, to his cousin the Amir Baud was always taken for granted, and as a rule he accompanied the Amir Baud and remained under his observation. He was in the suite of the Amir Baud during the recent visit to Bahrein, and the political agent has recorded what precautions were taken for the security of the Amir Baud at night. E Possibly the object of the arrangement by which Feisal-bin- Turki, son of Ibn Baud’s first-born son, has been brought up as the son of his uncle Baud is not only to give him a home, but also to take away any sense of grievance he might feel and to enable him to be kept under supervision. Not long ago the political agent at Koweit mentioned several Saudi tribal leaders living in exile who were believed to have common plans for making trouble on Ibn Baud’s death, while many people believe that the loyalty of the Governor of Hasa, son of the great Ibn Juluwi, will not outlast the life of Ibn Baud. Then there are the members of the Ibn Rashid family, who live in honourable but irksome exile in Riyadh, with their womenfolk still in Hail. Finally, there are all the tribes3 to whom r p&lt;ioc saudica means boredom and deprivation of the opportunity for men to distinguish and enrich themselves by* raiding. It seems hardly possible that there should not be some trouble when Ibn Baud dies, and it may be true that only an Ibn Sand could deal with such trouble if it arose. His ability and experience are unique in the Arab world, and enable him to apply the personal methods of the sheikh to the large and complicated State into which his tribal has grown. Even if his successor had Ibn Baud’s natural ability, which seems unlikely, it will not have been sharpened by years of hard and dangerous experience. Then there is no permanent civil service with a vested interest in stability. The provinces are run by Nejdis, who may be amirs to-day and nothing to-morrow, while the departments are largely in the hands of men who seem to use their opportunities to fill their pockets and are assisted by a crowd of spiritless small officials who receive very low pay which is often in arrears. 7. It is not necessary to take these gloomy speculations very seriouslv, since Ibn Baud may live for twenty years yet. Moreover, it is possible that the discovery of oil in Hasa may make for stability—a point which will be dealt with in a later despatch. 8.

BvXlard to Viscount Halifaa)—{Received May 16.) (No. 78, Confidential.) My Lord, Jedda r April 25, 1938. IN my two despatches No. 66 of the 17th April and No. 70 of the 19th April, 1937, I had the honour to report to the Foreign Office on a society called “ The Friends of the Hejaz,” which was alleged to have been formed in Egypt. I said it was doubtful whether any Hejazis resident in this coup try would venture to. join a society aiming at the independence of the Hejaz, but admitted that Hejazis had a grievance, in that the income from the pilgrimage, which was for centuries a.perquisite of the Hejaz, now has to support the whole of Saudi Arabia. In a later despatch. No. 91 of the 8th May, 1937, I reported the issue of a proclamation in which Ibn Saud invited his subjects to return to religion and uttered strpng criticisms against “ modernisation ” and “ civilisation.” In the Jedda report for May 1937 there appeared this comment “ This proclamation came as something of a surprise, as nothing had been heard of any movement for reform, and enquiries made since have discovered little to justify Ibn Saud’s alarm. The young Syrians, and the few Saudis who have been educated in Egypt, may sigh for the cinema and stronger drinks than pink lemonade; the Italian-trained pilots are said to give themselves European airs; and one rich young merchant uses his position as an honorary consul to frequent places where greater freedom of speech and refreshment is possible than in any Saudi house; but it doesn’t amount to much.” 2. The rich young merchant in question is Muhammad Ali Riza, son of the late Haji Abdullah, Kaimakam of Jedda. At a recent party at a foreign Legation he drank too much, as he usully does on such occasions, and in conversation with Mr. Ousman, a member of the Legation staff, he spoke strongly against Ibn Saud and the Saudi Government. He professes to believe that the death of the Amir Khalid, which I reported in my despatch No. 64, dated the 4th April, was not the result of an accident, though he has nothing but suspicion upon which to base such a conclusion. He has a private grievance, in that he believes that Ibn Saud shortened Haji Abdullah’s life.

Sir, Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 11.) Jedda&gt; May 15, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 108 of the 5th April, I have the honour to state that the Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd May published a fairly long report, dated the 26th April, by the special commission appointed by the King of the Yemen to enquire into the circumstances of the attempt on Ibn Saud’s life on the 15th March last, together with a short formal letter of the 29th April, in which the Yemeni Minister for Foreign Affairs forwarded the report to Fuad Bey Hamza. These documents are not worth submitting to you in full. 2. The Yemeni Commission stated that they had investigated the ante cedents of the persons implicated in the outrage and named in the second communique enclosed in my despatch No. 86 of the 22nd March. One, Ali-bin- Ali-al-Hadhri, proved to be a subordinate officer in the Yemeni army, of good previous character, who had got leave to make the pilgrimage. His brother Salih had returned to the Yemen last year after two protracted absences separated by a short interval, the first in unnamed foreign countries, the second in Abyssinia. He had taken out a passport and accompanied Ali on the Haj. The third, Mabkhut-bin-Mabkhut, was a soldier, belonging to the same village, Beyt Hadhr, as Ali and Salih. He had set forth on the pilgrimage without leave, and there fore counted as a deserter. The commission could find no trace of any person corresponding to the passport in the name of Mes’ad-bin-Mes’ad (or some similar name, for variants are mentioned) which was found among the effects of Ibn Saud’s assailants. 3. The commission confessed their complete failure to discover anything about the proceedings of the three or four men, their connexions with other people, or any plot. They surmised that the passport of Mes’ad, or whatever his name was, had been taken out in a false name by someone not belonging to the Yemen, who might have escaped after the outrage. They noted darkly the absences of Salih from the Yemen and hinted that the clue might be found in the countries he had visited, but observed plaintively that they had no means of investigating his activities abroad. 4. The Umm-al-Qura published this inept document without comment. It is increasingly evident that the Saudi Government have no intention of magnifying the affair into a cause of open quarrel with the Yemen. The Yemeni authorities, though compelled to admit that the assailants killed at the Haram were Yemenis, cling fondly to the suggestion that they must have been egged on by outside instigators. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Bushire, Aden and Cairo. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. [431 1—4]J@} JS ' jyy~ 86. RXATH WKT 3. )m .

When received it proved to contain a great deal of interesting matter besides the two communiques enclosed in that despatch. The leading article, headed : ‘ ‘ They Wished Evil for him, but their Intrigue has been Frustrated,” presents few features of interest. The most salient were perhaps references to the sword by which this country was conquered and from which the incident would remove the rust that might gather if it remained long in the sheath; The writer was reserved regarding the position which the affair had created. 2. The paper printed twenty telegrams received from heads of States and other personages, together with the King’s replies. Euad Bey Hamza tells me that many other telegrams were received, but it must be assumed that, so far as heads of States are concerned, the list was complete up to date, in which case several even of those who are in relations with Ibn Saud seem to have neglected to congratulate him. The heads of States whose telegrams were published were, in the order of printing, those of Great Britain, &amp;c., Iraq, France, Yemen, Italy, Transjordan, Persia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Koweit. The other personages, were M. Mussolini, Prince Omar Toussoun, Nahas Pasha, “ on behalf of the Wafd and the Egyptian nation,” the President of the Supreme Moslem Council of Palestine, Prince Muhammad Ali of Egypt, two Syrian notables, viz., Nasib Bey A1 Bakri and Hashim Bey A1 Atasi, Hamad Pasha A1 Basil of Egypt, Mr. C. R. Crane of New York, and the Saudi agent in Cairo. The telegram of the. last-named was presumably included because the abnormal position between Egypt and Saudi Arabia had been held to preclude any direct official expression of sympathy and congratulation. The agent reported that visits of congratulation had been paid to him by the Egyptian Prime Minister, the Governor of Cairo and other personages, as weir as by foreign representatives. He also mentioned numerous telegrams, including one from His Majesty’s High Commissioner and one from Sheikh A1 Maraghi. 3. By far the most interesting telegrams were those exchanged with the Imam Yahya. There were two telegrams from the Imam. One of these was. directly inspired by the incident. The other began as an acknowledgment of the receipt of a letter which his courier had just brought back from Ibn Saud, but this also was almost entirely devoted to the attempt on the King’s life. Both, especially the second, abounded in the author’s usual pious rhetoric. The kindness of the King’s letter almost broke the Imam’s heart. As for the attack, it had caused that same heart to drip with grief and had filled his eyes with tears. For the rest, he refused to believe that the crime had been the work of Zeydi Yemenis. If it was, they must have been set on by an evil hand outside the Yemen, the hand of enemies disappointed over the conclusion of the Treaty of Taif. He and his were as innocent of it as was the wolf of the blood of Joseph. He had instructed Abdullah-al-Wazir to give every assistance to the Saudi authorities in their enquiries. Replying to both telegrams at once, Ibn Saud affirmed his appreciation of the Imam’s feelings in regard to a sorrow common to them both and his confidence in Abdullah-al-Wazir. He himself, he said, had dis countenanced any molestation of Yemeni pilgrims and had charged A1 Wazir to quiet and comfort them. The assailants were, however, undoubtedly persons from the Yemen, and full particulars had. been obtained regarding them. The King completely exonerated the Imam himself. 4. The Umm-al-Qura published also a telegram from the Imam Yahya to Abdullah-al-Wazir expressing his grief at the incident, adjuring him to do all in his power, and again expressing the belief that, if the assailants were Yemeni, EASTERN (Arabia). / April 23, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [E 2574/7/25] No. 1. (No. 96.) Sir, Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received April 2^.) Jedda, March 27, 1935. [381 z—4}2 \ they had come from some wicked place outside the Yemen to create disturbance, 1 All the same sentiments run through a long telegram from the Yemeni Minister l for Foreign Affairs to Fuad Bey Hamza, in reply to a telegram from the latter, (which, perhaps significantly, has not been published. Qadhi Baghib was even 1 more eloquent than his master and supported what he said by curse and oath. 5. The same number of the Vmm-al-Qura includes, in a short general account of this year’s pilgrimage, the reply given by the King to those who offered him their congratulations at Mina. This is of less interest than the interview mentioned in paragraph 5 of my despatch under reference, tvhich also appeared. In the interview the King explained why he had resisted the suggestions Of his own people that he should visit foreign lands. He expressed his cautiousness, as a simple Bedouin, unfamiliar with tricks of language, in regard to journalists, who Were accustomed to manipulate it. He was, however, ready to answer any questions. Three of the questions put to His Majesty related to the attempt on his life. Speaking of it generally, he convicted his assailants of irreligion. He caring only for the Unity and the protection of what he possessed. He had been saved by God, but his first concern had been the safety of the pilgrims. He described the measures he had taken to close the doors of the Haram and to prevent bloodshed therein, after which he had completed the circumambulation of the Kaaba and returned to Mina. Replying to a second question regarding the investigation and the position Of the Imam Yahya in the matter, the King expressed his conviction that the Imam had had nothing to do with it, as “ the man was not devoid Of religion ” and their relations were excellent. He left it to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to inform his interlocutors regarding the enquiries which had been made. His Majesty returned a more guarded reply to a third question about the suggestion that Seif-al-Islam Ahmad had been respon sible for the affair. There was much talk, he said in effect, about many persons and he could not go by rumours. He Went on to speak of a presentiment ne had had at Arafat, how he had thought of means to deal with and arrest an assailant, if one should mingle with the crowd, and how he had then, confiding in God, let it pass from his mind. He went on to say more about the Unity and the purity of the belief of the people of Nejd, who took their stand on the Koran and tradition, as expounded by the four Imams. 6. The King replied to various other questions, which bore less directly on the subject of the present despatch. As his utterances, except as regards Palestine, were not of sufficient importance to report separately, I may as well sum them up briefly here as follows:— (a) He was favourably impressed by the sympathy shown by the Egyptians* Who were brethren and with whom there was no* cause for dispute. (b) On the Iraqi journalists expressing pleasure at what he had said to the party of Iraqi boy scouts, the King affirmed solidarity with Iraq. (c) I am reporting separately His Majesty’s remarks about Palestine; (d) Replying to an expression of Moroccan sympathy with himself and his people, the King said that many of the tribes of Morocco were of Nejdi origin and that Arabs were all of one race. 7. The Saut-ut-Hejaz of the 25th March adds nothing of interest to the above, except a reference to a sympathetic telegram received by it from an Egyptian lady named Labida Ahmad, who had played a certain role in the past in Ibn Baud’s entourage. 8.

I HAD the honour to inform you briefly in my telegrams Nos. 60 and 61 of the 15th March of the attack on Ibn Sand and the heir apparent in Mecca that morning. As usual on such occasions, the affair rapidly became the subject of a mass of varying and often conflicting rumours, but none of the variants appeared to me to be of sufficient importance to telegraph. I now enclose translations of two communiques which were telegraphed to the foreign missions on the 15th and 20th March. Q These, especially the latter, are probably more trustworthy than .any of the numerous other versions that have reached me. 2. The facts that the attempt was made within the precincts of the mosque Rnd was made during the greatest festival of the Moslem year not only add to its dramatic interest but invest it in the eyes of Moslems with a peculiarly sacrilegious character. The religious law may be susceptible of different inter pretations, but the broad principles may be summed up in the statement that gratuitous bloodshed, whether of man or animals, is at all times forbidden in the sacred precincts of Mecca and that the festival entails a sort of Truce of God between enemies. The principles are so strongly held that the question may be raised in quarters critical of Ibn Baud whether the slaying of his assailants in the Holy Place was not more than was necessary to stay their impious hands and there fore unlawful. The historical instances of bloodshed in the actual mosque would appear to have been extremely rate. Indeed, one informant states that the only case on record is that mentioned in Muir’s Life of Muhammad (p. 410 of the 1923 edition), and that that is doubtful. 3. Even the second communique leaves certain points indeterminate. It is not clearly stated that the two policemen, who were struck down, lost their lives, hut it is probable that one if not both were killed. The wound of the heir apparent is understood to have been rather more serious than is implied, but in any case it was not grave. It is tacitly suggested that the King suffered no hurt. I am •assured, however, that he was slightly wounded in the leg by flying splinters. It was thought at first that a bomb might have been thrown, but the more accredited theory now is that the splinters were struck out of the marble pavement by the firing of the guards. The communique discloses doubt regarding a point of some importance, i.e., whether there was a fourth assailant, who got away. 4. There was some panic in Mecca and a great deal at Mina, where large numbers of pilgrims were congregated for the festival. There is no doubt that feeling in the King’s entourage was greatly inflamed. There was talk of a general onslaught on Yemenis and of arresting Abdullah-al-Wazir, who, as you will remember, came to the Hejaz last year for the peace negotiations and established intimate personal relations with Ibn Baud and who is now back again as a greatly honoured pilgrim. Happily, the King himself displayed both courage and good sense. It appears to be true that he and the heir apparent completed the sevenfold circuit of the Kaaba, though I believe that they abandoned the further rite of passing the prescribed number of times between Safa and Marwa. The King, moreover, gave stringent orders that there were to be no gratuitous reprisals. The police are said to have made a good many arrests, and even to have used torture, hut there was no promiscuous attack on Yemenis, which might have led to massacre. 5. There have naturally been various theories as to the origin of the incident. Some suggest that it was due merely to the indignation of the assailants at being thrust aside by the guards to make way for the King. Yemenis are said to be very quick with their daggers, when offended. This theory is possible, but on the whole improbable, as, if the men had not gone to Mecca with the special object of making P) Not printed.o their attempt, they would probably have performed the pilgrimage. Assuming that they did go' there with that object, it becomes a question whether they did so •from motives of private'vengeance, or by instigation. People in Mecca have been very ready to believe that they were set on by high personages jn tjhe Yemen, not, indeed, by the Imam Yahya, but by others with ranklirig memories of the past, e.g., the Imam’s eldest son Ahmed, whose dissatisfaction with the issue of the war &lt; and general restiveness&lt; are notorious. It plight be inferred from thp stress^laid by the Saudi communiques on the fact that the criminals were not ouly Yemenis but Zeydis, an4 from the aw»»t^iv^%Qf thej.r j^spojts, that .the gaudi Govern ment leant to this vSfew. If they adopted it dehhitely, the incident ihight po^sildy have important political repercussions. I am told, however, by Mr: Philby (a) that it is recc^niseh in high qqartere. thpt,, althop^h j^e.p^|)ort^ were signed by one of the Imam’s sobs, t this is a .ndrmal way pf i issi|.ing passports ht Sanaa; and (b) that ^ in ah ihtervie^y given to jo;^^!^ on the i9th March the King himself exonerated the King of the Yemen and his sons froni any responsibility for the outrage. I have not yet seeh this intetyiew, hut,, if Mr. ^philby s statement is correct, it would apear that Ibii Saud has, already taken his line and will not let the affair outwardly affect the relations of this country with the Yemen. 6. I am told that the first telegrams, of Congratulation bn his escape which reached Ibn Sand were that of His Majesty King George hnd that of the Imam, jhe latter is said to have disclaimed responsibility, and suggested that the outrage was the work of some.unspecified £ * foreign finger.” This is not the fiySt time that the Imam Yahya has adjured his brbther-Arab King to beware of foreigners, meaning Powers that are neither Arab nor Moslem. Ibn Saud has sometimes Echoed the Imam’s sentiments in this respept, blit it is interestihg to note in the present connexion that, three days jbefore the incident at the Kaaba, .when addressing the notable pilgrims assembled at his annual banquet, he scouted the theory that foreign influences had brought about the Saudi-Yemen quarrel Of last year. ... ,• 7.

After the' fourth time, His Majesty the King took hold of the black stone and then walked until he came near the door of the Kaba? when a man came out of the northern opening of ,f Hejr Ismaildrawing his dagger and shouting? uttering some words not quite understood* ..hen coming out he met the policemen who were walking in front of the royal procession One of the policemen caught him intending to remove him, but the criminal quickly stabbed him with his dagger and the brave policeman Ahmad Ibn Musa ai-Asiri fell bleeding to the ground* Another /policemanpoliceman named Majdn’a Ibn Shlbiab then seized the criminal, hut was stahhed hy the dagger of the criminal so he also fell hy 'The side of his companion# At this moment an accomplice of the first criminal was seen advancing from behind the procession, and it seemed that he came out from the other opening of 'Heor Ismail', and Came from the direction of the southern corner until he approached the black stone,, The royal body-guard then got ready with their rifles, but His Majesty the King gave his orders at this dreadful critical moment to the effect that the body-guard should not fire except in caCe of absolute necessity,, 'when it appeared that the first criminal had stabbed two brave policemen and that the second criminal was about to reach His Highness the Heir Apparent, IToeyd Allah al-Barqwani one of the two personal body-guards of His Majesty the King advanced towards the first criminal and fired at him befor’e he could commit further crimes; so he fell dead at the entrance of 'HeJr Ismall’U The other criminal advanced with a drawn dagger in his hand and was about to stab His Highness the Heir Apparent a mortal blow, but Kheir-Allah the personal body-guard of His Highness quickly fired at him and killed him at the moment when his dagger touched the lower part of the left shoulder of His Highness the Amir Saud. So the stab only caused a slight scratch, thank Godo When the third criminal saw what had happened to his two companions, (he appeared to have come out from 'Hejr Ismail' with the second criminal and to have advanced from the direction of the southern corner towards the black stone) P he ran away trying ijo escape, but he was fired at by the policemen and the royal body-guard* He fell on the ground mortally wounded and lived for about an hour, during which time detectives were able to discover his name, which is Ali* There was no means of knowing the identity of the criminals at the .time of the incident, but their clothes and daggers show that they were of the Zeydi Yemenis and /theirtheir ages are hetween 35 and 45. in the meantime the Director General of the police, Mahdi Bey, at Mina, was informed of the (^currence, and he came with a sufficient police force and began to make enquiries and investigations in order to identify the criminals and find out the .reasons that caused them to Commit Such a dreadful crime in the holy mosque , near the sacred Kaba, and on that auspicious 'day© Great consternation was caused' amongst the pilgrims. Troops and people became very excited when it became known that the criminals were ( of the Yemeni peopleo There might have been serious consequences had it not been for the wisdom of His Majesty the 'King who issued his gracious strict orders to the commanders of his troops in Mecca and to the Director General of police to be careful about the safety of the souls of the Yemeni pilgrims, to secure them against attack and to take all measures to prevent anyone who might attempt to violate the sacredness of the ' 'Earam 11 and disturb the pilgrims of the holy mosque. Such, quick measures had the best effect for the avoidance of any grave incidentSo People performed their rites undisturbed and completed their pilgrimage in perfect tranquility, thank God. The Director General of police spread his spies amongst the Yemeni pilgrims, from whom it had been established that the criminals came* He was first able to discover that three of the Zeydies had been living, apart from all their Zeydi companions, with Shawafie of the Yemeni pilgrims, in the house of a woman in Jebel Abi Qubeys-, This fact attracted his attention. He therefore enquired about them and found that they had left their house and did not return to it since, the day of the 'Faqfa' (of Arafat). He immediately sent a force to the place and Inspected the room in which they had been living and there he found their clothes and passports in the names of three persons viz: 1 ) An-Haqib Ali Ibn Ali Hazam al-Hadhri, employed in i the Mutawakijji (Yemeni) Army, passport No.98 dated 10 th Shawwal /1353136^, issued Toy the passport officer at San'a and endorsed by the Governor of* San*a® 2) Saleh Xhn Ali al~Hadhri, brother of the former, holder of passport Ifo.34 dated ? shawwal 1353, His profession is farmer.

She recognised one of them named Saleh and identified the clothes of the other two, as the appearance of the faces of those two was changed. She said that the sister of the Shawafie Mutawwif lodged them in her house, and on enquiries being made of the other one, she confirmed the statements of the first one. The Director' General of police made investigations with the Sheykh of the Yemenis of Jedda, and the latter admitted that he gave a paper to travel from Jedda in the name of Mabkhut through his brother Ali Ibn Mabkhut the baker at Jedda. The man in question was summoned and questioned. The dead bodies and photographs were shown to him. He identified them one by one and said that one of them was Mabkhut Ibn Mabkhut al-Hadhri, his brother, and the other two were Saleh Ibn Ali and Ali Ibn al-Hadhrl, who are both brothers. The said baker stated that he met his brother at Jedda, and that his brother slept with him at Jedoa and that he went with him to Mecca and slept with his brother and the other two criminals at Jebel Abi Qubeys. He further stated that he went to Arafat, but the three stayed behind in Mecca and did not perform the Pilgrimage and that h© saw thgja only on th© 'id day at the time sf 'Tawaf' (sirQumambulatien of the Kab&amp;)and that after 'Tawaf” he went to the shrine of Ibrahim while the three went and sat in 'Hejr Ismail”. No trace nan yet he found of Mesid the soldier employed in the Mutawaklfti army and it is also not yet known why he left his passport with the criminals# The dead bodies of the criminals were buried yesterday after they had been identified, and the baker is still in prison# 14th Dhu f 1 Hi^'a 1353.

Extract Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.l of 1935 for period 1st January to 15th January 1935* 6 . BIN SAUD AND RIATH NEWS . The following interesting items of gossip were given me by a Mutairi falconer (friend of mine since six years, and persona grata with Bin Saud) who was with the King recently on his Hunting Expedition in the Summan region and returned with him to Biath. He came up to Kuwait on 14th January 1935 to see his family; (a) The King hunted east, west, and north from his main camp at Dhahal al Eraih; and under cover of his hawking expeditions appeared to take special / interest in the selection of possible sites (for military or customs posts) along the line Hafar al Batin-Safa-Warba-Jerriya-’Nta, i.e. the main wells facing Kuwait.- (This may presage something significant. (b) The King never went as far as Hafar or ’Nta, but scoured the country between the other wells, visiting among other places TURJUBI (North-East of his camp/ and camping at Urn al Hashim (due west of main camp) • (c) All 'members of Al Saud family except Mohamed (brother joined the King. Ibn Masaad’s son who came with him, went down with smallpox at the Dahal. (d) Faisal joined the King actually at Um al Hashim and 3 days after protested quite openly to his father at his wasting his time in hunting. The line he took was that his father 1 s continually absenting himself from business looked very bad in his people’s eyes, and his moving about in the Summan near Kuwait would, he said, V be misunderstood ■* &lt;s&gt; 2. (e) by both Kuwaitis and the English. Faisal and Ibn Musaad returned to Riath with the King and remained with him there several days, owing to heavy rain closing the roads. U) Oh 17th day of Ramathan Ibn Hathlain (Zeb Sahman) recognized head of the Ajman arrived from Kuwait to submit to Bin Saud (See Intelligence Summary Ro.12 parat 132). He was accompanied by 60 followers. Bin Saud received him very well, treated him with much honour and feasted him for five days. (g) The rumours of jealousy between Faisal and Saud the heir apparent were not true; certainly outwardly both appeared on excellent and even Igl affectionate terms* Neither were the other rumours that were going round, that Ibn Musa’ad and Ibn Jaloui were at loggerheads founded on any fact* w There was however a deep seated and long standing quarrel between Bin Saud and his brother Mohamed (hence the latter’s absence from the shooting camp). Mohamed■’ s grievance was that while Bin Saud had given the viceroyalties and governorships of Hejaz, Hassa, Hail, and Medina to others, he his own blood brother had hitherto got absolutely nothing. He had waited years for a reward for his loyal adherence, but nothing had eventuated. Bin Saud’s reply had always been and still was, that Mohamed must be near him to assist and support him. He dare not give him a governership, as it would be most difficult, nay impossible, to degrade or dismiss him, should he rule badly. The disgrace would be too much* Such reply naturally failed to ”cut ice” or satisfy Mohame d/3. Mohamed, who not only n sulked” regularly these days, hut had resulted (in the last two years) in his refusing to swear fealty to Saud, the Heir Apparent 7 an annual innovation. When reproached with this hy the King some time hack, Mohamed had replied that while to him, Ahdul Aziz, he would remain loyal to the death, he objected strongly to swear future fealty to a person who if the King died, might not prove at all worthy to hold the reins of power* 11 Let the host man win after your death, 01 Brother”, is what he is reported to have said to Bin Saud. (i) To mollify Mohamed, the King had given his daughter to 'Khalid” his son, a one-eyed hoy of outstanding bravery and spirit, after the latter 1 s return from .the Yemen campaign. It was this Boy who attempted to murder Saud, the heir apparent, 5 years ago, when he was in the w hammam B (hath) hut in the gloomy light, he had shot and killed Saud 1 s servant instead. (A hit of secret history, which few know about). Khalid is today kept continually hy the King’s side, and is much petted and honoured hy the sovereign. (j) The King had become very much’fatter 1 in appearance the last few months (the informed expressed the hope that he,was not going the way of his father Ahdur Rehman, who in later years developed a sort of dropsy) which seemed to affect his movements, and to some extent his mental alertness. lit0 4. (k) Bandar, recognized Shaikh of the Mutair (though not the official nominee) the son of the late Faisal al Buwish, continues to he treated particularly well by the King, who gives him 300 Rials monthly, as well as 16 bags of rice: The King also treatsc Faisal 1 s wife, the lady 'Amsha' and Hamaidi, Bandarte younger brother equally well. other (1) 3)he Mutair tribe as a:whole are on the/hand still being subjected to much cruel treatment, and Ibn Jaloui is allowed to execute on the slightest pretext, especially those caught blockade running from Kuwait* (m) Bin Saud (vouched for as having been obtained from a Olerk of the Treasury) has spent enormous sums of money on entertaining his tribal Shaikhs during the last 3 months. Actually on one day he disbursed 70,000 Rials in gifts. COMMENT * Referencd paragraph (m) above. I have heard it said from quite reliable sources in Kuwait that the King (apart from the money he has received from the Standard Oil people) must be getting money from some European Power. His Majesty 1 s Government has been suggested once or twice, but since Fuad Hamza’s visit to Paris last summer, it is now openly 11 said that he has received a secret loan from France. Certainly both Fuad Hamza and Tusuf Tasin are commonly spoken of by even very pro-Saudi persons, as being in the pay of France.Confidential D ,^7 Bushire, tMe 28th F@vember 1934.

With reference to my despatch ¥©.286 of the 18th September, in which I briefly reported Ibn Baud’s return t© Riyadh from Taif, I have the honour to inform y©u that, al though the King's movements convey the impression that the general situation in this country give no cause for dis quietude, I have recently received reports from two sources which would suggest that Ibn Saud's triumphant assertion of power in his recent struggle with the Yemen has not al together overawed certain disaffected elements within his own country. 2 . Discontent is said to exist in the Jauf and Teima areas and forces are being sent there ’to stabilise the situation. My Indian vice-consul has Just returned from a visit of several weeks to Medina and reports that recruiting is being unobtrusively carried on in the town, the troops being destined for service in those northern districts. That there was trouble, of an undefined nature, in respect of three tribes in the north, whose names, however^ were not specified, I gathered a few days ago indirectly from a subordinate in the Governorate here. 3. These reports lend interesting corroboration to the information which has recently been appearing in the Royal Air Force Monthly Intelligence Summaries for Palestine and Transjordan, of which the most recent example is contained in paragraph 261 of the summary for August 1934. 4.

(a) Since tbe writer returned from leave, ke bas found many opportunities of discussing past Yemen events witk a number of Bedouin trans-border chiefs, as well as with the Shaikh of Kuwait and natables of the fown. On all sides he has been told that Bin Saud has definitely lost much ”prestige 11 as a result of the War. Everywhere the belief is very strong that had Bin Saud been strong enough, nothing in the world would have prevented him from over-running or crushing Yahya. He however found himself in imminent danger after his seizure of Hodeida, of being surrounded and his armies destroyed so he wisely obeyed the instincts of self-preservation and made the peace he did. Yahya was also satisfied, being an old man and without aggressive ideas - for had he not won the moral victory and forced Bin Saud to withdraw, without so much as surrendering an inch of Yemen territory, or paying a rial by way of indemnity? (b) fhe barren Hejran after all was no gain to Bin Saud, but has merely been given to her own people, the Yam tribe, who are blood brothers of the Murra. and Ajman tribes. (c) She above is the appreciation of the aituation among Bin Sauds great tribes and the people of Kuwait, and I believe sums up the situation correctly# (d) Since the King*s return to Riath he has been generously rewarding the Shaikhs and other prominent persons who helped to receive at all those who failed to answer his call to arms. She latter are all known, and their names have been recorded g mi?©fully , and they will ofy no/no doubt be dealt with when Bin Sand feels himself strong — enough to do so* (e) According to Ibn Mussaillim of the Rashaida,Bin Saud is now universally hated, where in the old days he was respected and even loved. One of the causes that have brought about this, is worth recording. Apparently in the past when two sections or individuals of a tribe quarrelled and broke the peace, he. Bin Saud, used to investigate the case carefully and punish the wrong-doer. Today he ferociously seizes the best property in camels and sheep of the whole tribe for allowing, as he says, the incident to have happened. The Bedouin in other words feel that the innocent as well as guilty are being punished and resent it in proportion. (f) To distract attention from himself and once more dangle before the eyes of some of his stalwarts the idea of booty, it is widely stated that he has recently been talking much of another campaign*P„Z.6999/34 Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary,No.10 of 1934 For the period from 1st October to 31st October,1934.

Ibn Musaillim, paramount Shaikh of the tribe with some 60 tents transferred his allegiance from Bin Saud to the Shaikh of Kuwait (See para.34 (Yi) of Intelligence Summary No.3 for May 1934). Ibn Musaillim has been given a plot of land in Kuwait town, behind the Shaikh 1 s palace and has already built a residence for himself and immediate followers with the assistance of the Shaikh of Kuwait. The incident is interesting, as showing that Bin Saud* s hold over his Bedouin tribes is growing weaker and may be put down to the result of the Yemen campaign. A year ago this move would not have been possible. For the information of those who do not know local politics, the Rashaida ( a serf tribe of the Mutair) have always been looked upon as a Kuwait group and the particular fighting men of the Shaikh of Kuwait. When the Mutair became good n Akhwan n and were taken by Bin Saud from Kuwait the Rashaida who own much property in Kuwait Town refused to follow* During the troubles of 1920-27 when Kuwait was being raided almost daily by the Akhwan of Bin Saud, the Shaikh of Kuwait unable to protect the large flocks of sheep and camels belonging to his Rashaida, gave Ibn Musaillim a free hand to join the Akhwan if by so doing he could save his animals. Ibn Musaillim accepted the offer, went over to Bin Saud with 2/3 of the Rashaida and so saved the tribal wealth. Neither he nor his followers ever became true Akhwan, and always maintained secret allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait and promised to come hack when the chance offered.COPY, X'» (E 6996/6090/25) No*2945/196/40* Gon£4ctential* ^British. Legation, I Jedda, Saudi Arabia 6tb November, 1934. Pear Rendel, I find at present little in the general situation to justify a more formal report, but there are one or two matters which appear to call for mention though perhaps inappropriate to a despatch* Amir Feysal left (with Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman) for Riyadh yesterday evening, a visit which has been impending, according to report, for some time. It was said he was awaiting the arrival of Talaat Pasha Harb by air from Egypt, but the Pasha has failed to appear (though tents were erected and the landing ground prepared several days, ago) and is now said to be due about the 22nd November* Feysal is reported to have been summoned to Riyadh by his father in connexion, the know-alls here would have us believe, with certain differences which have been making themselves felt between Feysal and Saud* Jealousy between these two brothers is, I believe, an old story but is said to have grown considerably sharper of late. As I have generally A indicated in the Jedda Report for October the reasons given are numerous* Saud is said to be sore that Feysal should have got the lion f s share of the &amp;udos out of the late war with the Yemen. He is jealous, too, of Feysal’s growing popularity in the He|az where the latter’s more easy-going and pleasure- loving/ G. W.

He may, also, imagine Feysal’s relations, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and after his journeys abroad, with foreign powers to be specially intimate; and probably has little use for Fuad Hamza and may suspect the tour of European capitals upon which he has recently been engaged* Feysal, I believe, has denied the report that he goes to Riyadh to be married, and confided to his intimate friend, Suleyman G-dbil, recently that he was thoroughly fed up I must apologise for retailing so much gossip, but it is, X feel, interesting and should, I think, be recorded. For the rest, there is nothing fresh to report about the situation at Teima; and Fuad Hamza has still to arrive back from his tour (though I gather from a recent despatch from Baghdad that he might go over there first)* Yours ever.

The Amir FeisaTs party arrived at Riyadh on the 21st May, and there was a banquet that evening. The ceremonial of the Baya was fixed for next day. The heir apparent had on his right his uncle Muhammad, the King’s eldest brother, who was already in Riyadh. With him were numerous other princes, including Saud-bih-Abdul-Aziz, the head of the Araif branch of the Royal family, and the Amirs of the House of Fashid. On the other side were the religious and civil dignitaries. The preliminaries included the reading of the King’s telegram to his heir and a further letter brought by the mission from Mecca. There followed addresses in prose and verse, culminating m a speech by the Amir Muhammad, who was the first to perform the Baya by shaking hands. He was followed by a string of religious and princely personages. The Amir Saud expressed his thanks and proceeded to receive the Baya of the general company. No express mention is made of the presence of tribal sheikhs. 1 need not trouble you with particulars of the subsequent banquets given by the Amir Muhammad and others. The delegates from Mecca left Riyadh on the 24th May and got back to Mecca on the 28th May. . , 2. In describing these proceedings, the Umm-al-Q/ura emphasises the importance of the role played hy the King’s brother Muhammad, and the fact that he was the first to perform the Baya. Incidentally, it describes him, contrary to the general opinion that he is slightly older than Ibn Baud, as being two years younger. The paper adds that it is disclosing no secret in saying that the Amir Muhammad had a considerable hand in the designation of the heir. 3. I may observe in this connexion that the only leading member qt the Royal family, other than the King, who was not present at the ceremonial at Riyadh, was the King’s second brother, the Amir Abdullah. The Umm-al-Qwra publishes a most loyal letter from this prince to the .Amir Baud. He excuses his non-attendance on the ground that the King had denied him permission to go, as he had wished to dp, and explicitly tenders the Baya by letter. His absence is, nevertheless, somewhat curious. Both the Amir Muhammad and me^Amir Abdullah, who is several years younger, have been credited m the past with ambitious natures, and there was a time when Muhammad was thought to be critical of the King, if only on religious grounds. It is worth noting that m a recent conversation with me about the designation of the heir apparent, Mr Philby said that Muhammad was a man of no political ambition and was wrapped up in religion, but hinted that the ambition of Abdullah was something which had to be reckoned with. I stress these facts because they may be important if Ibn Saud should vacate the throne in any near future. , T _. # 4. Had Polonius been a Wahhabi, he could not have improved on the King s letter to the heir apparent, except by shortening it. The published version is far too long to reproduce, but I cull the following points from the mass of injunctions, texts, &amp;c., contained in it:— (a) The King pays a tribute to the people of the Hejaz, of whose sincerity and loyalty he was sure, but whose expression of it excelled his (b) Of \he 6 people of Nejd, His Majesty says that he has written to them, granting their request in regard to the succession. • , , • y His Majesty reminds the prince that the A1 Saud have attained their position not by their own might, but by the grace of God, who bestowed it because of their belief in the Tawhid, i.e., His unity. [823 ee—2]2 o {d) He enjoins resoluteness bn his heir and reminds him of the causes of the decay of the Abbasids, who made friends with their enemies and held aloof from their friends, only to find themselves in the latter end attacked by the one and abandoned by the other. . (e) He inculcates respect for the aged of all classes, warning his son not to^~ ^ neglect them or to turn them away for minor faults, hot affecting k religion or the sovereign power. (/) There should, says the King, lapsing into unconscious; imitation of Cromwell, be a garrison in every place, composed of tried and trusty men, and they should be treated justly in ,accordance with the Sharia. {g) His Majesty enjoins respect for the Ulema, who are like stars adorning the sky, guiding the travellers and warning devils away ; but he draws a somewhat pointed distinction between those Ulema who shine both in knowledge and council and those who have knowledge only ^nd whose opinions are not necessarily to be.followed. , , - ^ (Ji) The King enjoins the closest attention to foreign affair^ and the policies and intentions of other governments. He emphasises the fact that the relations of. 'States are based on exchange of benefits and inter dependence of interests. The policy pf each foreign country should be studied in order to determine itg. attitude towards that of which it will be the prince’s task to promote the welfare and to undertake the defence : against enemies., News of the intentions of other countries, must be carefully sifted and not judged with reference to selfish desires. “ Beware,” says His Majesty, “bf statements made to you in the apparent form of advice, while inwardly something ’Mse is meant.” The prince^ polipy towards other Governments 'should be based, both outwardly and inwardly, on friendship and peaPe. The v King reminds his heir of his duties towards all Moslems and Arabs. 5 The Amir Baud’s reply to this long epistle i^s commehdably short and presents no special fesatu^ pf interest,, ' ~ . &lt; 6. In its gener al. comment ary on th.e doings of the two great Mondays in Mecca and Riyadh, the Vrrim-aflrQura emphasises the evils of dissension in Islam in the, past. It quotes the late Syed Ameer Ali’s references to the time when four rival leaders flew their standards at Arafat, and draws a further moral from a three-cornered contest, for the paliphate in the time of the Abbasida. It is the duty of the Aratjs, the writey say^^tp, do their utmost to aypid disputes and mistakes. He commends the decisipn of the King in regf^id to the succession, which was taken with these considerations in yiewj. 1 y, ‘ ' , j/ ! 7.

IN p],y telegram No. 95 of the 13th May I had the honour to inform you of the publication of an official communique relative to the designation of Ibn Saud‘s eldest surviving son as heir to the, Saudi Throne, a step which w&amp;s decided oh in principle, when Ibn Sand’s dominions were declared to be a single kingdom, but which has evidently needed much preparation in various quarters. 2. The procedure followed has turned primarily and essentially on the acceptance of an oath of fealty in a form known as Bay a. This oath was drawn up on the Hth May and subscribed to in the first instance by the Amir Feisal as President of the Council, certain religious dignitaries, the members of the Council of Ministers and the members of the Legislative Council. I enclose a translation of the material part of this document, f) following on a pious exordium, ft was presented to the King who approved of it. The communique issued the same day and published in the Vmm-al-Qura of the 12th May, intimated that the necessary further ceremonial would take place on the 15th May. An elaborate programme of the ceremonial was drawn Up and circulated. 3. The ceremonies in Mecca on the 15th May were staged impressively in all respects, except for the absence of Samlet. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia sat in Riyadh, while his brother Jeisal received the Baya on his behalf. At 8 a.m. the latter repaired to the Great Mosque, Where, surrounded by high personages and delegations from Medina, Jedda and Taif, he attended the pre liminary prayers, A salute in honour of the King was fired, and the Arnir proceeded to receive the general Baya in an adjoining hall by shaking hands with each of a numerous concourse of people. After this he held a reception at the headquarters of the Government to receive congratulations, the offerers of which were regaled with refreshing drinks. After the afternoon prayer congratulations were offered to the King. The Amir Feisal gave a banquet in the evening. On the 17th May he and a number of princes, including his younger uncles, two of his brothers, a cousin and three of his nephews left for Riyadh to Convey the Baya to the Amir Saud and to offer their own homage, They Were accompanied by a delegation composed of three members of the Legislative Council. 4. On the same day, the ihth May, the local Governors in The Hejazi towns received the Baya of the leading inhabitants in a manner similar to that observed by the Amir Feisal at Mecca, There Would appear to have been no corresponding ceremonial in Nejd pending the arrival of the Amir Feisal. The whole procedure presents peculiarities, which probably represent the resultant of conflicting principles. It has been very expressly linked up with the decree of the 18th September, 1932, which, when declaring the Union of Saudi Arabia, provided inter alia that the existing Council of Ministers, acting with other persons at the discretion of the President, should prepare a rule of succession to the throne to bp submitted for the King's assent. The only documentary Baya so far would appear to be that signed on the 11th May by the members of the Council, of Ministers and others. This was duly Submitted on the same day to the King and it might be thought that his approval completed the designation of the Amir Sand as heir. It was obviously thought either politic or necessary, however, to obtain the acceptance of the nomination by a much wider circle on the 15th May. Even now it would appear that strictly speaking only the people of the Heiaz have publicly sworn or endorsed the Baya. On the 13th May the King sent a long telegram to the Amir Saud, full of pious exhortations, to which the Amir replied P) Not printed. f p.z. ! £ yQ -jrune^l, 1933. Section 2. 1955 ] [823 x—2]2 next day with equal piety and at even greater length. Both King and heir are all for Islam in this correspondence, but its most interesting feature, in the present connexion, is a passage near 4 the end of the King’s telegram, echoed in the Amir’s reply. It was, “ People will perform the Baya to you in the Hejaz on Monday. Your brother Feisal will accept the Baya on your behalf. He as well as the members of the family will go to your side to convey to you the Baya of the people of the Hejaz, and in order to perform the Baya with you on their own behalf.” 5. All these proceedings and others of a minor nature which I have not mentioned doubtless kept statesmen in Mecca very busy. It was not until the 18th May that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed a communication to the foreign representatives, which took the form of a third person note, forwarding the text of the first communique. Before I had got off the congratulations authorised in your telegram No. 62 of the 16th May, I received a further com munication, a translation^) of which I enclose, together with a copy of my reply, f) It may be of interest to add that the Soviet Minister was present at the ceremonies in Mecca; and that my Dutch colleague, who rushed in with congratulations on seeing the first communique in the press, received a reply in which the Amir Saud spoke of his desire to devote himself to the interests of Moslems and Arabs, but said nothing about foreign relations. 6. I have dealt somewhat minutely with certain legal aspects of the designation of the heir apparent, not only because of their constitutional interest, but also because there is a political side to the anxiety shown to commit the people of the Hejaz to acceptance of the measure, independently of the steps which have certainly been taken in Nejd to ensure the consent of theologians there and* tribal chiefs. Much erudition might be expended on the historical traditions which have been followed. I will not trouble you with any long disquisition on a subject for which my knowledge does not suffice, but it may be of interest to add short notes on three questions, viz. f (h) Whether it is in accordance with the strictest Islamic doctrine that a ruler should designate his heir during his lifetime; (b) whether an heir, if selected, can properly receive Baya before the ruler- ship falls vacant; and ' (c) whether Baya is in its essence a religious act or even an act appropriate only to a successor to the Caliphate or Imamate of Islam. i 7. As regards (a), I understand that there is ample precedent for the CK designation of a future heir, even though it be admitted that in pure theory his accession must be ratified by some form of election or acceptance when it takes . place. Indeed, as you are aware, many Moslem dynasties have been and are - / carried on in accordance with rules difficult to distinguish from rules of succession of the kind common in Europe. I cannot resist the comment that, so far as I know, the first well-authenticated designation of an heir, or at any rate of a relative as heir, was when the Caliph Muawiya, that Muawiya who lifted his hand against the Hashimites, provided for the succession of his son Yezid. 8. As regards (b), I believe that there are precedents for this also. I think Mr. Philby told me, before he left, that there had been at least one in the history of the House of Baud. However alien to our own conceptions it may be that fealty should be sworn to one who remains a subject, this procedure has an undoubted significance for Moslems, as the oath is binding from the moment it is taken and entails strong sanctions, which may be summed up by saying that any subsequent violation makes the violator an outlaw and the shedding of his blood lawful. 9. As regards (c), there is no doubt that, however much Islamic countries may have adopted in practice European ideas of State organisation and sovereignty, there is always an underlying theory that temporal power is in principle the concomitant of a religious position. It is already suggested that in the present case Ibn Saud aims at perpetuating a religious position, which in Nejd counts for more than his kingship, and which is comparable to, though not described as, a Caliphate. As against this, you will note that the present Baya has express reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Even the Imam of the Wahhabis has to ada,pt himself to practical conditions, and what Ibn Baud has done has been to endeavour to consolidate his regime in that kingdom, perhaps ( x ) Not printed.^with an eye on its possible extension to all Arabs, but hardly to all Islam. He has not, you will observe, gone to the length of establishing a general rule of succession. He has merely provided for the first succession after his death, or, it might be, abdication.

Copy Extract Notes on His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad 1 s Trip to Riath. (k) On the subject of the Kuwait blockade Bin Saud kept complete silence and Shaikh Ahmad said it would have been undignified for him to open the question or make any mention of a matter which mightponvey the impression that he came as a suppliant. Bin Saud did however mention that he knew his frontier officers were mostly bad and were nearly always responsible for misunderstandings that took place. His frontier patrols also looted and stole helpless people’s goods, not for himself, Bin Saud, but for. themselves. He lamented the fact that he was surrounded by many of the biggest rascals on earth but what could he do running the 'show' alone as he was doing. As regards his official Ibn Khraimis on the Kuwait frontier, he urged Shaikh to treat him as his own official and order his every going and caning (a typical Saudi an move). XX XX XX VI. The following are sane of the imprAssions left on the Shaikh’s mind, as a result of his visit:- (a) Bin Saud’s position was unassailable so long as he remained alive. The whole laboriously built system would however most assuredly topple and collapse as soon as the King died. Bin Saud still inspired wholesane fear wherever he went and this was especially evident at Riath the heart of his Government. He was still a very great man and leader, but in his opinion (the Shaikh’s) the whole of the King’s system was more than ever a one man show. (b) Bin Saud was on the other hand a definitely sick and unfit man. Gone were the days when he was the hardest man in his kingdom and led every raid and foray. ShaikhShaikh Ahmad opined that this was because he never took any exercise these days at all and eat far too much. On one occasion he Bin Saud took the Shaikh to his old capital of Dharaiyeh and both got out to walk. After a hundred yards or so the King began to pant and blow, and said he could not go on. This gave the Shaikh the opportunity of giving him a lecture, and he urged on him the vital necessity of taking at least £ hour’s walk each day, and begged him to stop taking drugs such as 'cascara' etc.which apparently the King now cannot do without. (c) The King, said the Shaikh, eat far too much to be good for him, and at one sitting could put away a whole lamb himself. (d) The Amir Saud was a fine upstanding young man as tall as his father and with lots of character, but at the 'break up' which would assuredly follow the King’s death, the Shaikh much doubted if Saud would be able to 'make good'. There were the ambitious Mohoraed and Abdullah and a host of others, who all even now hated and were jealous of one another, to be reckoned with. All would be at each other’s throats when the strong hand left them. The Shaikh was particularly taken with Saud’s charms of manner and was overwhelmed altogether when the latter called and after paying his respects, said 'I want you to treat me firstly as your best friend,and sedondlv as your sop* and thirdly as your servant, not only during your visit here,but throughout the rest of our respective lives'. Perhaps the Amir Saud saw the day not far distant when he would want an ally on the coast. (e) The Amir Ibn Musaad had aged very greatly. He was only 40 years old, but the Shaikh who knew him in less peaceful times when they both used to go on raids together, said he was shocked to see what a great change had come over him. He was obviously being killed by worry and the cares of his hi$i Office. (f)(f) The Town of Riath was indiscribably filthy,and except for the group of rather fine houses inhabited by the King and his family which all communicated by means of upstair passages, was like a rabbit warren. Flies were dreadful and smells and refuse in painful evidence. The Shaikh said he again and again urged the King to build outside the city, for health reasons and encourage the members of his family to do likewise, (j) Splendid rains fell during his sojourn in Riath ‘and the whole country south and west of the Dahana was green and dotted with wild flowers. A contrast to the state of affairs north of the Dahana and round Kuwait. (Sd.) H.R.P.Dickson.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 11, 1932.) (No. 493.) j . Jejda, December 29, 1931. I HAVE attempted in my despatch No. 492 of the 28th December to give a general view of the economic and financial situation in this country. I have now the honour to submit some account of the political situation and the conjectures to which it gives rise in connexion with Ibn Saud’s foreign policy. The data are meagre, and I am even more hampered in this case than in my endeavour to sum up the economic situation by the fact that I have had no real contact with the Hejazi Government since my return to Jedda on the 15th December. I should, indeed, reserve this report for a later occasion were it not for its bearing on tho possibility of trouble on the northern frontiers of the Hejaz. 2. When Ibn Saud went to Riadh about the beginning of July lie was completely “fed up ” with the Hejaz and its problems. He doubtless felt; moreover, that the affairs of Nejd required his personal attention. It was significant that before going there he made one spectacular gesture designed to placate extreme Wahhabi opinion by deferring to the opinion of the ulema of Nejd on the impropriety of celebrating annually his accession to the Heja^i Throne. At the same time,‘he gave another indication of a swing towards tho extremists by reviving the machinery for the enforcement of strict religious, principles. He did not abandon his schemes for certain improvements on European lines to which fanatics might take exception, like the wireless project. Nevertheless^, in the published record of the proceedings of the “ National Conference ’’ held in June stress was laid on the principle that economic develop ment should be effected by the instrumentality of Moslems, and the King would not allow the Marconi expert, M. Boueicault, to go to Riadh to erect the wireless; station there. 3. While the King, on the eve of his departure for Nejd, was thus showing- himself not only a good Moslem, but a good Wahhabi, he had not despaired of European assistance. In his June conversations with me he made a strong appeal for a good understanding on all subjects with Great Britain, with special reference to his hope of getting His Majesty’s Government to give their patronage to himself rather than to the Hashimites and the feasibility of inducing a British bank to give him financial assistance. He took steps to explore the possibility of raising the wind in other European quarters also, notably in Holland. He engaged in dealings , with the Bolshevik representative, bqt there is nothing as. yet to show that he was prepared to give much more to the Soviets than the privilege of supplying him with benzine on easy terms, and possibly some relaxation of the restrictions on their trade. 4. The situation in the Hejaz, bad in June, has grown much worse since then. The towns have every reason for discontent, the tribes for disaffection. It is not possible to speak with equal confidence of Nejd,, but it is rumoured that there also there is much dissatisfaction. Apart from the usual tales of trouble with the tribes, there are specific allegations of discontent owing to oppressive taxation, non-payment of the wages of Nejdi Soldiers employed in the neighbourhood of the frontier, e.g., at Tabuk, levies in kind on merchants, attempts to impose the use of the unpopular Hejazi riyal, and the reforms; instituted in Hasa by the mission of At-Tawil. 5. Such is the internal situation with which Ibn Saud has to cope, as he sits tight at Riadh, attempting to deal with the affairs of the Hejaz from a distance with the aid of the advisers summoned in turn to the Nejdi capital; uncertain, perhaps, of his hold on Nejd itself, a country which he can only rule with a strong hand and largess, and the population of which are so little impressed by kingly majesty in itself that they are said still to use in speaking to him the address : “ Ya, Abdul Aziz! ” The King must realise by now that [3542 there is little chance of money from Europe or of the kind of positive support from Great Britain for which he begged in June—no British bank, no air forces no backing in his latent struggle with the Hashimites. Over all lies the shadow of a pilgrimage much smaller than that of last year, and worse times to come m consequence. 6. It cannot be wondered at that some observers expect the King to seek salvation in one or both of two things, adventure over the border, or an agree- Ip ment with the Soviets, He has engaged in military preparations, as he is always doing. The tribes, it is said, have been encouraged to hope, or threatened with the necessity of preparing for Jihad. For a time it was thought, that the objective was the Yemen, but since my return it has been announced that the King has composed his difference with the Imam in a spirit of piety and love of peace jn Arabia. The observers whom I have just mentioned are all the more disposed to think that he is preparing an onslaught on Transjordan, with the object of gratifying his mingled hatred and fear of the Amir Abdullah and gaining access, perhaps, to richer lands than his own. I cannot myself believe that he would be so foolish as to engage openly in an enterprise which would bring him into direct conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but the possibility cannot be dismissed in the case of a man, strong-willed and ambitious, who is already in hard straits and may be desperate in a few months. There is the alternative possibility of the same object being pursued less openly by the promotion of authorised raids. 7. Assuming for the sake of hypothesis that Ibn Baud has some such object in view, three questions, among many others, call for special consideration : What financial resources could he employ for the purposes of his adventure ?; What is the extent of the reported military preparations! On what outside assistance or sympathy could he rely, from the Soviets or otherwise? I will glance at these in order. 8. No one knows what reserve the King has at Riadh, despite the impoverishment of the jcountry. and the Hejazi Treasury. It has been suggested that he has been collecting treasure there, perhaps not gold or not all gold, but in other forms, riyals or jewellery. War taxes are said to have been levied on the Hejazi tribes and on the Nejdi townsfolk, 10 riyals a head, it is said, from the tribesmen, 400,000 riyals from those in the area round Taif, and further sums from those in the north. According to one account, the latter represented to the Amir Feisal their miserable poverty and offered men with riding camels instead of cash, an offer which the Amir undertook to refer to the King, but which the latter was thought unlikely to accept owing to his lack of confidence in the Hejazi tribesmen. Another tale is that the merchants of Anaiza and Buraida are owed £60,000 and have little chance of payment, though eight of them made their way to Mecca to ventilate their grievance, despite the efforts of the Governor of Medina to prevent them from getting further than that place. I cannot pronounce on the probability or otherwise of the King having collected any substantial liqui(Lreserve at Riadh by the alleged exactions and other means, but Mr. Hope Gill, wno has followed developments during my absence, especially Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s financial policy, believes in it. 9. As regards the extent of the King’s military preparations, I can again rely only on distorted rumours and a few items of fact. He has, of course, his garrisons on the frontier and in certain places not far from it, and he could obtain men from Nejd for a definite enterprise promising warfare and loot. Such troops as there were in Jedda would appear to have been moved to Mecca almost in their entirety. I see in a report from the Political Agent at Bahrein, dated the 23rd Novenlber, that an informant newly arrived from the mainland had noted an unusual withdrawal of horsemen towards Nejd, and supposed that they might be intended for an attack on the Yemen. I quote with great reserve a report which has reached me here; that the Polish engineer employed in the Government workshop at Mecca has been sent to recruit airmen in Poland. A good deal has been spent during the last year or more on military supplies. It is now said that 24.000 rifles have been repaired in the Mecca workshops, that there were recently 4.000 in hand which the mechanics were being pressed to repair without delay, and that further rifles were expected to be brought from the interior for the same purpose. It is also said that the Soviet representative has been offering rifles, with 1,200 cartridges each, at £2 10s. per rifle, c.i.f. Whether this be true or not, my informant, the Indian vice-consul, says that a friend of his who went3 ^ m . e a g° to the Soviet Legation to buy sterling chanced on one of the A1 Fadhl family and other Nejdis engaged in inspecting various kinds of rifle. 10. The third question need not be dealt with at length. My Russian ^colleague here has always struck me as more interested in commerce than in politics, and I see nothing in his burst of activity last summer or its results up kto date to make me alter that opinion. I can see the Soviets selling rifles or ranything else to Ibn Saud on cheap and easy terms, but not at the present time backing him in a foreign adventure otherwise than by perhaps looking on genially at any attempt he might make to fish in troubled waters. I discard as fantastic a further suggestion by my principal informant that Russia might, in an endeavour to compass the destruction of the British position in the Middle East, draw Ibn Saud into a general alliance comprising Turkey and Persia. I feel that, if Ibn Saud contemplated further adventure, he would work, as he has always done, on his own expansive lines, a raider in the grand condottiere manner. There may be more to be said for suggestions that he has sought to gain Islamic sympathy through agents in countries like Transjordan, the Yemen and Hadhramaut, perhaps even further afield. 11. This is not intended to be an alarmist despatch. I am only too conscious that the basis of ascertained fact on which I have built is very slender. In my attempt to produce a balanced superstructure I may have given it too formidable an appearance. While writing I have had before me the extremely interesting paper by Major Eowle enclosed in Mr. Walton’s letter to Mr. Rendel of the 18th November. It will be seen that, though Major Fowle pays me too great a compliment in suggesting that I know more about Ibn Saud than anyone else, my mind has been working on the same general lines as his. There is this difference : that looking at the King in the light of the most recent events, I suspect that the test of his success may come before he disappears from the scene, and I conceive tentatively the possibility of Ibn Saud himself, rather than his successor, being driven to the Course suggested in paragraph 10 (b) of Major Fowle’s memorandum, that of launching Wahhabi attacks on the surrounding unbelievers. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, His Majesty’s High Commissioners for Transjordan and Iraq, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

the most he will tolerate Is that of his Shaikh, and even this grudgingly and generally only when it suits himself* Of any sort of combined and sustained co*operation whether for peaoe or war he is normally quite incapable, though occasionally influenced by religious fanaticism and under a leader of genius such as Bin Baud he can work with his fellows for a few years towards a common end* Raiding - atf economic necessity f 4* All these are platitudes of course but they serve to bring the country into perspective, and while on the subject of Arabian characteristics a short comment may be made on the phenomenon of the aftaccij or raid which plays such a part in life in Arabia, and which is the cause of not a little anxiety to her neighbours* These raids are of two kinds - internal and external* It has of ten been pointed cut by writers on Arabia that the former « which are conducted under certain conventions, preventing any excess of bloodshsd « are In the nature of a sport,with prises in the shape of loot, corresponding to our western sports and games, in fact practically the only sport with which the Arabian * • •‘3** Arabian ocut %nXi?m his otherwise somewhat monotonous existence* ( As a side issue it may be noted that the l&amp;habis hare 8f Xate introduced an element of savagery into times raide quite unknown before in Arabia )* There is also the prestige attached to the successful raider, and the Arab ~ like ether folk * is by no means indifferent to the admiration of his fellosman • and women# The further interesting point has also been made# which is not by any means so obvious* that these raids may really fulfil an economic purpose by providing • if in a wasteful wsy * for the re~ distribution of stock between the tribes* it As for ths external raids* these are made into what has been called the 'Fertile Orescent' i*e« 1 XraqyFalestine and ayria* and follow the tradition of thousands of years that the hungry ♦desert 1 shall fill its stomach from the well-fed 9 sown* * thus also fulfilling an economic law* in fact the oldest extantt n That he chan take who has the power* * And he shall hold who can* ” 6* Economic necessity is a sharp spur *, and to the extent that raids are due to this cause* they must be consider* ed as all the mere formidable* That there are strong impulses behind the raids is shown by the fact that a fairly strict control on the $art of Bin Baud* and adequate defence measures on the part of the authorities in ♦Iraq* Palestine and Trans~Jordanfe, have failed to put a stop to these incursions* even though they have been always suoessfully repelled* X 3 reaent position of Bin 3aud * 7* Ths position is* therefore* that for his own purposes * *»-4- purposes - to weld his kingdom together ~ lln Saud has laid a han on internal raiding, and for the sake of his foreign relations • with Great Britain and France the two Powers principally concerned - has prevented to a certain extent external raiding* It is these bans which have largely contributed to his unpopularity with his Wahabi followers* and which were for instance one of the underlying causes of the serious rebellion against him in the winter of 1929-50 by Faisal Bawish* the fahahi would doubtless welcome a cessation of internal bickering in return for the promise of a glorious combined first-class raid on the Fertile Crescent* But when he is forbidden to do either he is - naturally enough - discontented and rebellious* In fact Bin Saud in being compelled, owing to various causes, to stop raiding of all sorts is - from one point of view - really sitting on the Arabian safety-valve, economical and psychological, and if this view is correct it would seem only a matter of time before the engine blows up* Arabia without Bin Saud * 8* With regard to the future of Arabia without Bin Sands this is at least as an important a consideration as the present of Arabia with him* In fact the real test of Bin Baud*s success will only come when he disappears from the scene, and it is proved whether he has left behind him a stable kingdom or - like so many Oriental rulers before him - merely a temporary erection which will collapse when deprived of his presence* 9* A consideration of Bin Baud 1 s disappearance from the ArabianArabian scene is of course far from being academic* He is now 55 years old, and must one day die a natural death* Or he may di e an unnatural death any day * he has many enemies, or as he gets older his grip may loosen, or he may fall from power prematurely# Recent despatches from Sir Andrew Ryan, who of course knows more about him than anybody else, indicate that his position is far ffom secure* ( ride £.0-0 Jeddah despatch Ho * 34© of 19 th August 1931 to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). Briefly he is trying to ride two horses, or shall we say two camels ?, at once, and is losing control of both. He is not Wahabi enough for-the Wahabis, and yet too Wahabi for the Hedjaai, He has risen to power by the support of a primitive, fanatical and warlike sect, whose principal aim in life ' • ' is to loot and kill tha unbeliever, i.e*any non-Wahabi,but is for various reasons - see para 7 above for instance - losing their support, while he has entirely failed - see para 12 below - to gain the allegiance of his non-Wahabi subjects. The financial condition of his kingdom, vide for instance Jeddah despatch Ho.253 of 1st July 1931 to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, is parlous in the extreme. In fact peace in Arabia may not even depend upon the pressure of Bin Baud* Should his control on the Hedjaa and over Hejd, the one acting on the other, weaken appreciably, should in fact his position become desperate, there is always one course which he could adopt, and which would at any rate rally the Wahabi elements behind hims to raise his war-standard, and on some pretext or other, sweep down at the head of &amp; host of the Faithful on ’Iraq, Syria or Palestine. This contingency is, of course, unlikely, but* not perhaps beyond the bounds of ail possibility# In fact during the critical times of Februaiy and March 1928, when some of his tribes broke loose from his territory and raided ’Iraq, it seemed possible for a brief Period ... : Jperiod that he might be forced by his rebellious subjects to take this hazardous step* Brentuallfc fe s on disappearauce of Bia Baud * 10* As for the inevitable time when Bin Baud must disappear from the seene, for one cause or another v one of three eventualities will arises* (a) A successor will take his place 9 who will be able to control Hedjaz and Bejd as Bin Baud is doing at present* and peace will continue. Who his successor may be is doubtful* i ^jp- Mis eldest son, Amir Baud, is the Crown Prince, and Heir Apparent, but Arabs think very little of primogeniture, and cling to the older and more violent tradition of *let the best man win* provided generally that the best man belongs to the Shaikhly family* (b) The successor will be unable to control the kingdom, and keep the peace* In order to secure his position at home he will try the expedient of a war abroad,( a traditional policy in the Bast , its last exponent being Am&amp;nullah of Afghanistan, and by no means unknown in Europe until modern times), will throw his lot in with the war party * the Wahabis, and will launch attacks on the surrounding unbelievers^ (c) Mo successor will appear with shoulders broad enough to carry the abba of Bin Baud, his kingdom will disintegrate, and Arabia will relapse once more into her accustomed anarchy, a feature of which will certainly be sporadic raids into the by by Fertile Orescent, not only^fehabi tribes proper, but ml all those who * Wahabi or not * have been included in his terri tory and kept under his control* 11* Of these three eventualities if (a) materialises then Arabia will continue as at present and no further commentsLL~ji Ux M ^j sC' * il ^ uu I . I J h&gt; aiZ^r A' M are necessary* Loss of Hedjaz by Wahabis . 13* Unf ortunately, however, it seems much mere likely that either (h) or (c) or a combination of both will a rise* What will happen in the Hedj as in either event i s not th e immediate concern of the Indian Government, from whose point Of view this Hots is written,/the Wahabis will probably lose it* They only acquired it by the sword, are disliked - if \ not detested « by the local inhabitants, and have no roots in the country* With Hejd In ferment, and the tribes ^p* either raiding each other, or raiding into the Fertile Orescent, it is difficult to see how Wahabi rule can be maintained in far-away Hedj as* As in the previous century Che Wahabis, after a period -of occupation of the Hedj as, will most likely withdraw* For Bln Baud 9 s is not of course the first Hejdi 9 raid 1 into the Hedjas* In 1802 the Wahibis took Taif and massacred the inhabitants, men, women and children, exactly as they did a century and a quarter later in 1924-25* In 1803 they took Mecca, in 1804 Medina, and as a repetition of history it is interesting to note that * certain features of their rule then, good and bad, tranquility wqs amongst the former, are in evidence today* ( See Lorimer 9 s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf Vol*l*?art 1* Historical)* Their occupation continued until 1913,l*e* about 9 years,when they were expelled by Mohammed All, Pasha of Egypt, acting under orders of the Sultan of Turkey* Paldstine*Trana-Jorddnls and t Irag* 13. As for Palestine, Trans-Jordanlm and 9 IraqSyria of «»•of course will likewise hare difficulties, but those will be the eonoern of the Treneh)»under eventualities (b) and (e) the authorities of these areas will undoubtedly have to face a serious crisis |ts$d$GQ&gt;&amp;: in the shape of raids and unrest* She seriousness of the crisis will lie* not in the danger of any particular raid but in the cumulative effect of the strain and expense entailed by meeting an indefinite number of such incursions spread over a prolonged period. For once the controlling hand of Bin Saud is lost* on the assumption that his successor cannot fill this place it is impossible to say how long it will be before another controlling authority will arise, and in the meantime raids will presumably continue. On the Berth West frontier in India where the same situation there exists* o&amp;Ly that/it is not the case of the 'desert* and the 'sown* but of the similar age-long feud between the 'mountaineer* and the 'lowlander'* the Government of India have tackled the situation by a forward policy* which by the taking over of certain tribal tracts and the building up of roads will at the same time put important, strategic areas in our hands, bring the tribes more under our authority* and by the development of such resources as he possesses lead the tribesman gradually into peaceful ways* But a policy which is practicable for a settled population of mountaineers living in villages cannot obviously be applied to Bedouins scattered over huge areas of desort* 14* It may, however* be practicable to build posts at important wells and so deny them to raiders* and to organize the tribes of threatened areas sojthat they can assist in their own defence* Coincident with this it might be found expedient to resuscitate if possible the Shammar Amirat© of Ibn Rashid at Hail - a point of considerable strategical importance # + *importance in desert warfare in northern Arabia * and thus form a barrier against Wahabi incursions from the South* At one time indeed 9 and not so long ago, it was the Ibn Rashid and not the Bin Saud of the day who was Arabia* s big mn* In i@SS, for instance $ Mohammed bin Andullah Ibn Rashid captured the Wahabi capital of Riadh and took its ruler a prisoner to Hail, under whose rule Southern as well as northern Wejd remained for some 14 years till the taking of Riadh by the present Bln Saud in 1902. From then on up ' to 1914 the Turkish Administration of 'Iraq found in the rulers of Hail« even though the Shammar power had weakened, useful allies against the rising tide of Wahabism* ( On the outbreak of war Ibn Rashid declared for the Turks, but Hail was not taken by Bin Saud, and J'&amp;bal Shammar annexed to Bejd until 1921)* Air Route and Fine Line * 15* As far as Basrah the Air Route should not be affect* ed by tribal disturbances in Arabia* With regard to the Persian $ulf Section* At the moment of writing this Mote v C September 1931) it has not been settled whether the Air Route shall run along the northern or Southern shores of the Persian Gulf * If the former the Air Route in the Persian Gulf Section will in no way be affected by events Of in Arabia* If the latter then the remarks in para 17 below are relevant* In view of the fact that flying boats will be used no trouble need be anticipated up to and including Bahrain* At Ras-al-Khaimah, the next halting place, however. If the Trueial Coast is infected with the general unrest consequent upon the break-down of central control in Hejd, some trouble and perhaps opposition to the continuance •••17. continuance of tne rente* may fee expected* file safeguarding of the projected Pipe Line and railway from ’Iraq to the Mediterranean will fee a cause of some anxiety to the authorities concerned* It is true that the line will run well Horth of Arabia proper* but anarchy at the centre * in Hejd will create unrest beyond the frontiers* Just as a stone dropped in the middle of a pond will send ripples far and wide* Defence of 1 1raq* 16* lor Palestine and Trans-Jordan the Government of India is In no way responsible* and Syria is under a French mandate. If assistance is required for the defence of the two first named it will fee forthcoming from areas unconnected with India - Bgypt or perhaps England. Hor is the Indian Government in any w^ responsible for ’Iraq either now or next year when it will become an independent country* But though independent ’ Iraq will still, under her treaty with Great Britain* have claims on the armed assistance of His Majesty’s Government in case of foreign invasion* Should whatever R*A*!.elements left in ’Iraq, with the ’Iraqi forces* fee sufficient to repel the series of raids fore shadowed above - well and good* If* however* this should not prove the case *( and of course it is quite outside the scope of this Hote to give any opinion on this point)* and ML. military assistance from outside Sf required, it seems obvious that the Indian Government will fee appealed to as the nearest and most convenient area from which such assistance can fee supplied - especially if this assistance \ ff V-. : : ||pVv v '.$PfSPs 1 '.; f:' y is required in a hurry* The Persian Gulf*The Persian Gulf !?• In this quarter the Indian Government has of course certain responsibilities which will be increased by the disappearance of Bin Baud* To take the various areas in turn* The Hus eat State is remote from lejd and has had little to do with Bin Baud, though his ancestors claimed sovereignty over it» and round about 1S12 ©ver~ran part of 9 Oman f and succeeded in converting the Bani Bu Aliy of Ja&amp;lanj (near Sur)* who remain Wahibi to this day* Brobably en croachments on Bar&amp;imiy c point of some local strategical importance from which the Batineh coast of f Qm&amp;n can be threatened on one side, and the Trucial coast on the other 9 may be expected* The Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast » when pressed by us to do something they don f t w&amp;nty have been known to throw out dark hints that they may be compelled to seek the assistance of Bin Baud* although in practice they have little to do wit^h him* On his disappearance should some local enterprising Shaikh make himself an independent Amir of Hag a a certain amount of interference of the latter in Trucial coast affairs, and consequent unrest may fellow* as well as in Qutar * Bahrain being an island, will be safe from Hhhabi incursions, but will doubtless suffer commer cially* At present a trade of some proportion goes on between the island and the mainland, both for the local needs of the province of Hasa, and for Bejd - especially since Bin Baud has 'blockaded* Kuwait* With Hejd and Hasa relapsed into anarchy this trade will of course decrease appreciably* On the other hand various problems connected with Bin Baud and Bahrain, and the intrigues of his agents - the Quasabis - will be automatically solved* On the whole therefore( therefore is areas so far reviewed in the Persian Gulf the disappearance of Bin Saud from the Arabian scene, while causing some local unrest along the Arabian coast, will most probably not entail any commitments or Interference, on the part of the Government of India except perhaps in connect ion with the Air Route ( see paragraph 15 )« fhe remaining area to be considered, however, stands on a different footing# 1®* Kuwait * an independent Arab State, under British protection, but not a British protecorate ' ( see P«G f 13, page 73,paragraph 2 ), His Majesty's Government are pledged to protect against foreign a gg ression , and in time of need the actual implement^ of this responsibility would - if military assistance were required most probably fall on the Indian Government# During the crisis of 1928 - already referred to. mn paragraph 9-3 ships of the Persian Gulf Division wore stationed off Kuwait, landing parties were disembarked, a temporary air base was established on shore, and a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars from ’Iraq were sent to the town# It was generally accepted ■ -• ( that this was sufficient to defend the town from attacks by tribesmen without artillery# At the same time it was pointed out by the Senior STaval Off leer,Persian Gulf Division, to the Resident that the whole of his division was thus immobilised at Kuwait and unable to perform its duties elsewhere,and that if a garrison were required at Kuwait for an extended period this duty would best be performed by a battalion of Infantry now envisaged,i*e« a oollapse of Bin Baud's kingdom and an irruption of Arabian tribes over the frontiers, first - a garrison might be required at Kuwait for a considerable peri and second - the Royal Air Foroe might have their hands too full in defending 'Iraq to detail aeroplanes or oars for the supported by artillery or ship guns. Under the conditions defence of Kuwait*19. Zn this case the defence of Kuwait would depend on the battalion of Infantry and Artillery, both presumably from India, or in lieu ^the latter ships guns, which would mean the ^tying up’ of the Persia# Gulf Ptrision - or part of it - at Kuwait, when it might be needed to cope with troubles elsewhere on the Trucial coast for example* Apparently not much assistance can be expected from Shaihh Ahmad ( of Kuwait ) himself, During the crisis it was proposed that he should purchase armoured cars, but this idea was finally abandoned for financial reasons# He has apparently little faith in the martial qualities of his Kuwaitis# In a conversation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, in August 1929^ and with Colonel Biaeoe in December of the same year, he pointed out that the real fighting strength on which Kuwait had always depended was the Mutair, Ajman and Awazim tribes which had been taken away from him and given by us to Bin Saud in 1922 by the Treaty of DJair. In addition to this his State has been greatly impoverished by the blockade imposed by Bin Saud for the last 8 years# This he feels all the more acutely as it was his gre&amp;tjanole the famous Shaikh Mubarak who offered asylum to Bin Sadd when an exile and a fugitive, who actually took the fifeld with the Wahabi leader on a hazardous and unsuccessful venture into Southern Hejd, and to whose backing and encouragement Bin Baud’s final and successful bid for power in 1902 was not a little due* Moreover when Shaikh Ahmad succeeded to the Shaikhship in 1921 he continued Mubarak’s policy towards Bin Saud, sending that individual Mho was then operating against Hail ( see paragraph 14 above ) Rs#1,60,000 in cash and 3,000 camel loads of supplies# Much later too, only14- a tern y«ars ago in the winter of 1929-30* it waa the refueal of the Shaitt* at our request* to allow Bin Bawl eh and his fellow dissidents to base themselves on Kuwait* or get supplies from it* that enabled Bin Baud to orush the rebellion* Arhbla a primitive and pastoral country is littls more than a gigantic desert (paragraphs 1*3)* and its most note worthy phenomenon* the aftaasu or raid* internal and external* may well be partly caused by economic necessity (paragraphs 4-6}* Bln Saints position appears at present for various reasons far from strong!paragraph 7)* and in any case the real test of his work will come when he disappears from the scene (paragraph 6}* That his control over Arabia must one day cease is of course obvious* and this aety possibly occur before his death (para graph 9)# then he finally disappears fssoBXjtdwsettQca»( para graph 10} Arabia will probably dissolve in chaos and the t&amp;habls will lose Hedje* (paragraph 12}* while there will be a prolonged series of raids on Palestine* Trans-Jordan and •Iraq#(paragraph 13), against which it may be practicable to resuscitate the Hhammar confederacy under the Ibn Rashids of Hall (paragraph 14}* It is not likely that the Imperial Airways Route will be interfered with* but the protect lean of the projected * Iraq-Mediterranean pipe-line and railway may cause some anxiety (paragraph 15}* The Indian Government may be called upon to assist in the defence of 'Iraq (paragraph 16} # and more particularly of Kuwait (paragraph 18), but along the rest of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf they will probably not be involved in any new commitments (paragraph tf}t Sd/- T*C*F.

Also included are copies of correspondence addressed to the India Office and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle, succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior).The correspondence begins with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf's response to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India's remark that British influence in the Middle East seems largely to depend on the life of one man: Ibn Saud.Related matters discussed in the correspondence include the following:The effect that Ibn Saud's death, or fall from power, might have on Kuwait.The designation of Amir Saud [Sa‘ūd bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd] as Ibn Saud's heir apparent in 1933.Rumours of tense relations between Amir Saud and his brother Feisal [Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Sa'ud].Arab public opinion on Ibn Saud, following the Saudi-Yemeni war.Reports of Ibn Saud and Amir Saud having been attacked by would-be assassins in Mecca in 1935.Amir Saud's visit to India for medical treatment in 1940.Reports of the arrest of ninety persons suspected of being involved in a plot to assassinate Ibn Saud in 1940.Other prominent correspondents include the following: the Political Agent, Kuwait (Harold Richard Patrick Dickson, succeeded by Gerald Simpson de Gaury); the Political Agent, Bahrain (Hugh Weightman); the British Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan; Sir Reader William Bullard; Hugh Stonehewer Bird); His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires, Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert); officials of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, and the Government of India's External Affairs Department.In addition to correspondence the file includes the following:A report by the Political Resident entitled 'The Future of Arabia', which discusses the present position of Ibn Saud and how Arabia might look without him.Extracts from Kuwait intelligence summaries.A copy of a report produced in 1937 by the Political Agent at Kuwait, Gerald Simpson de Gaury, on the history of the Shammar tribe and the Ibn Rashid [Āl Rashīd] family, which includes as enclosures a table of the Shammar confederation and a genealogical table of the Al Rashid family, both of which are printed in Arabic and English.A copy of a report, produced in 1938 by de Gaury, on the 'Anaza [‘Aniza] tribe, which includes a tribal table of the tribe.The file includes two dividers which give a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. These are placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia 'Abd al-'Azīz bin 'Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia Sa'ūd bin 'Abd al-'Azīz Āl Sa'ūd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Rashīd (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>'Aniza (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shammar (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Succession</topic></subject><subject><topic>Attempted assassination</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00026c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
