Specifically, it focuses on whether Kohuk should be awarded to either Persia or Kelat, or left independent. The narrative is primarily illustrated through extracts of correspondence on the matter sent between British and Persian officials. It largely draws on the opinions of Sir Frederic Goldsmid and Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson concerning the proposed status of Kohuk.The appendix consists of a copy of an amended note substituted for that signed by Charles Alison, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia, and Mirza Saeed Khan, Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 1 September 1871. It outlines an agreement respecting the demarcation of the aforementioned frontier.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Frederic John Goldsmid</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir 1st Baronet Henry Creswicke Rawlinson</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kohuk</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000047#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
