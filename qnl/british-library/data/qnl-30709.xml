He claim of Messrs iChemji Hamdas for ^ 170 against R.A.F, In December 1932 the then Political Agent X ordered the man in charge of Khemji Hamdas* s office at Sur to pay Shaikh Nasir bin Ali of Sur a sum 4 of % 10 per mensem on account of the pay of boat- men at Masirah. This 5 order was complied with^and Khemji Hamdas continued to pay Shailh Nasir bin Ali ^ 10 every month for il months after which on receipt of verbal ordeirs from this Agency they stopped the payment. Messrs Khemji Hamdas have approached this Agency on several occasions for refund of this amount (# 170) but they do not appear to have received it. The reason for non-payment of this amount - as far as I understand from the informa- i i tion received from other sourees - was that the X* Hoori which was given by R.A.F. for use at Masirah and for which the iroatmen were paid had been damaged and destroyed a short time after it was handed over and therefore no claim for the pay of boatmen could be entertained. As the payment of the amount a in question was made by Kheraji Ramdas in compiiance with the ins tructions received from the P.A. I don't think it would be reasonaole to punish them for carrying out the orders of this Agency. As the firm of Khemji ^amdas has always been useful to this Agency I venture to suggest that the R.A.F. authorities nay kindly be approached for payirent of this amounl them /■%?/ ^ ft ^I No. 66 Political Agency &amp; H.B.K’s Consulat Muscat tne 20th.

The payments were made by the aforesaid firm on a written authority from Captain R.G.Alban vide correspondence referred to above. This claim could not be forwarded to you eariiei as the matter was under dispute owing to the huri having sunk a short time after the boatman was engaged.'Since the2 the payments for 17 months were made on the written authority by the abovementioned firm, I trust that you will agree with me that the firm of Khemji Hamdas shojild not be made to suffer for the negiigence of others# 5.
