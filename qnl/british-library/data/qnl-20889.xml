' r ou very kindly supplied ChicJi last year with in formation as to the amount of tea imported into Bahrein and smuggled thence to the Persian coast.

I should be very much obliged if you could give me similar details for the year March 1909-10. Sorry for trou ling.

The eatinatea were prepared after oonaiderahle inveati ^ationa, and the follo^.TlnR lacts will, I think, ahow that I have not overeatina- -ted the amounts exported to Persia. 'it (a) Bahrain is a siaall tea drinking jominunity and ia also known that the inhabitant® of the Arab ^oaat are praotioally entirely ooffee drinkers. (b) It is knoTO that the importers to B^Jirain are all Persian merahants, and they *ive over the tea to r'erjian boatmen, generally rr, anTi»tania, who either purohaae the tea outriTht, or act aa oarriera only. It is obvious that the tea was suxu-^led into Persian territory f ^r otherwiae laerjhanta would not pay freight to Bahrain and 5^ Oustona duty in Bahrain and freight of aailiii^ veaaela baok to reraian loaat and uake other riaka involved. The only way ii.iport or export froxa Bahrain jo\-ild be atopped would be by the Sheikh of Bahrain imposing a prohibitive lute*, but it would not be fair to ask him to iamage hia trade in thia way and the jorreot method appeara to ) e either for tne i J eraian Oustoraa to more strongly patrol their Ooaata, or preferably to reduce the tariff against tea to reaaonable dinenaiors JtoreoverJ I oreovar ware export of taa froia Bahrain be ✓ ^ at/O^ped t#hia trade would eoon find new oent/ree such as jboha or Kuwait. As r« ; !:arda British trade, the greater aaoimt tea sxiaiT-led thr m^h, the greater bei.efit to the/trade. 'i'he only losers besides t)\t; Persian Oov«nnent are a few In lian nerohanta in Persia who cannot oompete on le^al lines, and therefore lose their tea trade. The profit wade by them would not however nearly amount to the profits attained by sellers of Indian tea on aaoount of the inoreased import due to smuggling, and moreover they oan employ their money in other artAoles of trade. It is therefore obvious that our trade is actually benofitad by this sxnu.'Tglin^. Of course the Indiaii sellers are quite iimooejit as tliey iixerely shiplto hahrain. ^ Captain# r 'olitioal A Tent, -iahrain. Bahrain# 30th September 1910,■-^ ^U &amp; ^OFFIfE^OJE.

The principal correspondents in the file are the British Vice-Consul in Bushire (Herbert Chick until 1910, Newton Worral thereafter) and the Political Agent in Bahrain (Captain Francis Beville Prideaux until May 1909, Captain Charles Fraser Mackenzie from May 1909 to November 1910).Each year, the Vice-Consul in Bushire requested from the Political Agency in Bahrain, figures on the amount of tea exported from Bahrain into Persia. These requests were made in response to a continuing fall in the legitimate import of tea into the Persian coast, and a corresponding rise in tea smuggled into Persia from Bahrain. A note on the smuggling of tea from Bahrain into Persia, written by Mackenzie and dated 30 September 1910, provides an overview of the situation, with export figures covering the years 1907-1910 (folios 33-34). Much of the correspondence between Chick and Prideaux/Mackenzie is demi-official in tone, and includes additional commentaries relating to a number of other commercial matters, including the presence and activities of the German firm Wonckhaus &amp; Company (folios 8-9, 17-18, 19), and the possibility of English-speaking Hindu merchants being appointed as agents for shipping in Bahrain (folios 8-9, 10).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tea</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ef#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
