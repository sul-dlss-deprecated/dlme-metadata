Thus the area is clear of the Russian sphere (en which point Russia insisted), and lies to quite half its extent in the neutral zone, and is cut off from the sea, 2. 'The concession which the .Syndicate aims at ia one drawn up in 1910 by IT. rreeoe for Uri Torbett Pleminr. It proridea for the exploitation of all minerals in the specified area, for the construction of the necessary tramways, buildings and works; the construction of quays etc., on 2 points on the Oulf to be connected up by tramways with the ■nines.

In June, 1913, however, the ibisaian Oovernnunt intervened on behalf of the 3ooi#tl d' E’tude, (the international syndicate created to examine the trans-Persian railway project,}pointing out that the concession area is that throuf$ which trans-Persian Railway would run, that all Railway concessions in the east include the mining rights on each side and that without these the Railway’s success would bo threatened. It suggested reciprocal grant of facilities in Russian and British spheres, and equal division of interest in the neutral zone. 6. Hr. f ;r»«nway objects to the intrusion of the Socidtd, pointing out that the grant of the concession was to bo a condition of the dyadicate's acceptance of the option for the ! ohasmaerali-Klicrreraibad Railway; that the £100,000 his Syndicate is to advance an conclusion of the two concessions, was in return for a mining monopoly in the specified area. He points out that he was first on the spot, and had practically conclude the affair with Shuster in 1911. In spite of this, he is willing,if His ’ajesty’s Government presses it, to consider the admittance of the .loei4t4 to a 1 aiiare in the enterprise, so far as the neutral zone is concerned.
