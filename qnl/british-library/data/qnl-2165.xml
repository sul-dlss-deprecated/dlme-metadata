Memorandum by Sir H. Rawlinson. I venture to think that the importance of the so-called project of “ opening up the Karun ” has, as far as British interests are concerned, been vastly overrated. It seems that, some years ago, certain British mer chants who were engaged in the Persian trade, and who found that the very heavy expense of the land carriage between the port of Bushirc and the markets of Central and Northern Persia placed them at a great disadvantage in respect to their Russian competitors, looked wistfully to the Karun waterway leading into the interior of the country as a means of affording them relief, not unnaturally hoping that, by starting their caravans of goods from advanced posts up the river, like Shuster and Dezful, they would sensibly reduce the cost of transport, and be thus able to meet the Russians on more equal terms in the markets of Isfahan and Teheran, and even of Tabriz. It thus became of great importance, according to their view of the question, to obtain a right of navigating the river Karun and its tributaries from Mohamrah upwards, and the British Legation at Teheran has accord ingly, under instructions from the Foreign Office, and in supposed support of our economical and political interests, kept up a strong and sustained pressure for some years past at the capital, in order to wring this concession from a reluctant Government. But the whole argument, as it appears to me, rests from the outset on a fallacy, for neither is it possible to render the “ Karun ” navigable to steamers, except at a cost entirely disproportionate to the results and quite beyond the means of the local Government, nor if our merchants could convey their goods by water to Shuster and Dezful, would they have at all improved their general position. I now go on to explain briefly these two crucial points. Firstly, in regard to the Karun, it is well known that the river is barred at Ahwaz by a succession of rocky strata which run across the river bed, and from rapids, some miles in extent, preventing any continuous navige. tion, except in high flood, when, for a few weeks in the year, light crafr, can be hauled by main force over the obstructions. Captain Wells and Mr. Barhig, who have recently visited and reported upon the Ahwaz barrier, express themselves most unfavourably as to the prospect of overcoming this difficulty. As the river falls seven feet in passing the “ bund,' it is feared that, if tin rocky barrier were removed by blasting, the upper part of the stream would be drained and rendered unnavigable. Mr. Baring accordingly sees no alter native but the trans-shipment of goods at the “ bund,” which, indeed, is the course at present pursued by the local traders, but which would by no means suit European steam traffic; while Captain Wells suggests a canal with locks, a very expensive undertaking, and not likely to be entered upon by a mere trading company. The second difficulty to which I have drawn attention is still more dis couraging. It must be conceded that the present trade route into Persia from the sea coast is inconvenient, circuitous, and expensive. The passes between Bushire and Shiraz are notoriously bad, and in some places dangerous. The distance from the sea coast to the capital is 700 miles, and as wheeled carriages are almost unknown, the expense of transport is heavy; but in spite of all these drawbacks, I have no hesitation in saying that the present caravan route by Shiraz and Isfahan is by far the best line of access to the interior of the country. Because there is a saving in distance of about 200miles in the direct line from Shuster to Isfahan, as compared with the route to the same place from Bushire, via Shiraz, it has been assumed that the former must afford the best and cheapest mode of entering Persia; but, in truth, map distance has little or nothing to do with the argument. I assert with the utmost confidence that the direct line across the mountains from Shuster to Isfahan cannot be made a commercial route. Mr. Baring says of it,—“ The difficulties are enormous. One passes over ridge after “ ridge, as if one were going oyer the teeth of a saw.” In history it was considered one of the greatest achievements that the Atabegs of Luristan, in the 13th century, did construct a made road across these mountains from their capital of Aidej, or Malanier, to Isfahan; but the Jddeh-i-A tabeg, as it was called, never became a trade route, and very soon fell into ruin owing to natural causes. Nor is there any other avail able route into the interior from Shuster or Dezful which is at all to be compared with the high road from Bushire to Shiraz. Mr. Baring in his report (page 16) speaks of a road from Shuster to Gulpaigdn directly across the most difficult portion of the range, but I have been assured on the spot that this track, which crosses the Dezful river at the Pul-i-Hiil, is only practicable to foot travellers. An unladen mule cannot even be dragged over the slippery sheet rock which occurs in every stage. Another road conducts direct from Dezful to Khoremabad, and this I have actually fol lowed, performing the distance in five days, but it was a clamber throughout, the line being absolutely impracticable to caravans, and being, moreover, entirely uninhabited. The only high road from Shuster to the .interior of Persia, the only road indeed that would be available to British merchants, who might have conveyed their goods by steamer up the Karun to Shuster, is that noticed by Mr. Baring at the end of page 15 of his report, which conducts up the valley of the Kerkha to Jaidar and then strikes off to the north-east along the line of the Kashgh;m river to Khoremabad. Of this road, along which I have also travelled, I can only say that the passes are not less difficult than those on the Bushire-Shiraz line; that there is not a single village between the plains of Dezful and the open country of Khoremabad, a distance of at least 150 miles, and that the tribes moreover of the lesser Luristan, which command the entire transit, are among the most lawless and savage of all the Persian mountaineers. Caravans do certainly at intervals pass by this line from the low country of Susiana to the Upper Persian plateau, but they pay a heavy black mail for the right of passage, and are obliged, moreover, to carry all their provisions with them. And it must be added that the distance from Shuster to Teheran via Khoremabad and Hamadan can be very little less than that to the same place from ^ushire via Shiraz and Isfahan, while with regard to Isfahan itself, which )ems to be the great centre of mercantile attraction, the direct route along le present high road through Shiraz is in every respect preferable to the rcuitous crack by Shuster and Khoremabad. I am strongly, therefore, of opinion that the whole question of 44 opening up the Karun ” is a delusion and a snare. The Karun, in the first place, mnot be opened up ; and in the second place, if it could, it would yield no (vantages to British commerce in regard to placing our merchants in Persia more on an equality with those of Russia. What is required in the interests of our trade with Persia is the construction of a good metalled road over the passes, and, if possible, along the entire line to Isfahan. If the Zil-i-Sultan would undertake this work and aid us in establishing a wheeled traffic upon the line, he would have far better earned a title to the G.C.S.I. than by obtaining for us the empty right of navigating the unnavigable Karun.
