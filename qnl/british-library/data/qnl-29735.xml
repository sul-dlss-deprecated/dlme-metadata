Gj^son, ©rreJe^ehce to your letter P.Z.3673/38 qW $ 12 IT2J M ill3 r 2l^(5) of the 28th May 1938, I have to send you he rev: it h two copies of a published Admiralty Chart described as 'Persian Gulf Western Sheet', Nod. 2837E. V Marked upon the Chart in red crayon are channels to Dhulaifain and Has Tanura respectively on the east coast of Arabia. 3 The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which is a Delaware Company, Subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California and of The Texas Corporation (both American Petroleum Cor-panies) has been conducting surveys for some time past with the object of opening up these channels and of charting and buoying them, and in this it has been aided by many kindly suggestions from the Admiralty - Hydrographer 1 s Department. The aim of the California Arabian Standard Oil Com pany has been to open up jeither Dhulaifain or]Ras Tanura as a port or anchorage on the east coast of Arabia to facilitate the opera tions of the Company in relation to the exploration of Arabia for petroleum resources and the development of those resources when found. As you are aware, the Company has recently discovered what promises to be an oilfield on the Dammam dome and this has rendered-2- &amp; the need of the Company for a port or anchorage on the Arabian coast sooner than had been anticipated; the Company’s plans xor develop ment of that area have had to be accelerated by virtue of the dis covery and it would be of the greatest possible convenience to the Company to have port or anchorage facilities by next September. ^ The Company appears to be satisfied that the cnannels to both Dhulaifain and Has Tanura are clear. 4 All of the maps and field notes resulting from the Company’s surveys have been handed to the Admiralty and the ^-diiiiralty expect to be in a position to publish charts embodying these data some time during August. It is, of course, desirable to buoy the channels as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. ^ As I understand it, no question arises as to who should mark the channels; that, I believe, is the task always undertaken by the Royal Indian Navy. There does, hov/ever, arise the question of how the assist ance of the Royal Indian Navy is to be invoked, and to what extent. /o In the early part of 1936 the Royal Indian Navy kindly assisted The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, another Subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California and The Texas Corporation, in buoying the channel to Sitrah, and it is hoped by my Principals that through the medium of your good offices the Royal Indian Navy will once again come to their assistance by buqying the channels to the anchorage off the Hainland.-3- v' l|. I might say here that it has not yet been determined whether Dhulaifain or Ras Tanura will be used as the Company 1 s port or anchor age but this will make little difference, I understand, in practice, for the reason that there is one main channel to both anchorages down to a certain point. It is proposed that that portion of the channel common to both anchorages, should be lighted by four buoys. If the Ras Tanura anchorage is to be adopted, then an additional light buoy will be required . fy You will observe it is intended to use light buoys; it is not proposed, so far as I am aware at present, that there should be additional dumb buoys or spars. * is understood, of course, that the work by the Royal Indian Navy should be at the cost in all things of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. f^f Nay I ask you, on behalf of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, to take up the matter of these anchorages with the Royal Indian Navy and to supply them with the information contained in this letter, and to enquire:- (a) whether the Royal Indian Navy would be able to supply one or more of the requisite buoys, and if so, whether by way of loan or sale? (b) the approximate cost to the Company of the supply by the Royal Indian Navy of light buoys upon loan and upon sale? (c) how soon the Royal Indian Navy would be able to lay the buoys? and-4- &lt;S&gt; (d) v/hether the Royal Indian Navy would be prepared to maintain the buoys at an agreed cost, in somewhat the same way as they are maintaining the buoys marking the Sitrah Channel? i have indicated above, the channel ultimately selected by the ComDany for use on the east coast of Arabia, should be open ior gen eral traffic during the month of September next. /(, I might add that if the Company has to provide the buoys, the type and specifications would meet any requirements oi the Royal Indian Navy to suit their servicing equipment and to conform with buoying rules prevailing in the Persian Gulf. J.F.Gibson Esq., India Office, Whit ehal1, S.W.1. Ends. Dely./ 11, Birchin Lane, London, e.c.3. 24th Kay, 1938. Dear Mr. Gibson, In connection with the buoying and lighting of the Sit rail Channel, The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited dealt with the matter generally through the India Office although it was the Royal Indian Navy at Bombay who did the work and who subsequently rendered appropriate accounts of moneys due to them in relation thereto. Somewhat the same kind of situation arises now in con nection with the buoying and lighting of the Channel leading to Dhulaifain on the Mainland, the Company concerned there being the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. As you know, Representatives of the Company have been discussing with the Hydrographer’s Department of the Admiralty (Rear-Admiral Edgell), the work done by the Company’s Officials on the spot and in San Francisco. The present position is this:- A certain amount of revised data has been prepared by the Company and which they expect to deliver to the Admiralty at the end of this month. There is every reason to believe that this data will be found by the Admiralty to be in order. Upon- 2 - that assumption the j^dmiralty believe the Charts will be ready and some copies will be published about .August next. As an aid to navigation it is desirable to buoy the Channel and if the buoying could be done without delay, the Admiralty would be enabled to mark on the published Charts the relative positions of the buoys. It is desirable, of course, that these positions should be marked on the Charts rather than that their positions should be left to supplemental information issued by the Admiralty. The question is whether the Company might now communicate with Bombay direct, or whether you would prefer they should communi cate through the India Office. VJould you be good enough to let me know what you would like the Company to do, and I vail pass the in formation on for immediate action to be taken.
