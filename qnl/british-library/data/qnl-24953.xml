T%-T Sir, 1 have the honour to invite a reference to my Printed Letter No.95-S of 17th February 1932, enclosing for your information letters exchanged between Yusuf Yasin and myself regarding the subjects discussed during my visit. It will be seen from paragraph 2 of that letter that Yusuf Yasin agreed that Hindu traders should be permitted to enter Qatif temporarily for a period not exceeding two months oneach occasion. 2, In this connection I would venture to invite a reference to Mr Stonehewer Bird’s Despatch No.96 of 18th June 1928 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It will be seen therefrom that on that occasion King Ibn Saud allowed certain Baniahs to return to Qatif for three months to settle their affairs, and also agreed to periodical visits to Qatif during the date season. It is not quite clear whether this permission was limited to the two individuals whose case was then under consideration, namely, Ratanmal son of Kanaymall and Maganmal son of Chonamal, or was intended to apply to Hindu merchants in general. However, that may be, from that time no Hindu merchants have been allowed to visit the H&amp;sa coast for the purpose of trade, and, as far as I am aware, no practical effect has been given to the under taking therein given. 3. The Political igent, Bahrain, has discussed the matter His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, British Legation, Is Ida.■ ■'T.f matter with some of the leading local merchants and informs me that they desire permission not only to visit iatif but aiso to visit Jubail, to which place a good deal cf trade has nowadays been transferred. I trust the Hejaz-Nejd G-overnraent will be willing to accord this permission and would suggest that, if possible, they should allow Hindus to remain up to three months. 1 would therefore request that, if you see no objection, you would kindly obtain the formal concurrence of the Kejaz-Nejd Government to the arrangement informally arrived at between Yusuf Yasin and myself, subject to the modifications suggested above, and ask them to issue the necessary instructions to their officials concerned. 1 am sending a copy of this Despatch to His Majesty*8 Secretary of otate for the Colonies.

The Colonial Office and the Foreign Office subsequently concurred in the proposal that the Consul at Jeddah should take up the matter with Ibn Saud at a suitable opportunity. On this being done, it proved that the expulsion of the baniahs was largely due to a misunderstanding, since Ibn Saud was under the impression that they had recently arrived in Qatif and desired to reside there permanently. On the facts being explained to the King of the Hejaz, he agreed to allow the baniahs to return to Qatif for three months to settle their affairs, and assented to periodical visits by them during the date season/season, and, as will be seen from his letter of the 16th June (enclosure No. 5 to Jeddah despatch No. 96), he has sent the necessary instructions to his Amir at Qatif. It is satisfactory not only that this incident should have been liquidated in the way it has, but that it should prove to have been due to a misunderstanding and not to a deliberately aggressive policy on the part of Ibn Saud.f l r _ In any further communication on this subject, please quote and address “^Ehe Under-Secretary IV StTCA /PQ!&gt; Cff —not to any person by name, bur to—' :tary of State,” Foreign 6flice, Lond/n, S.W.

In continuation of my telegram No. 88 , dated the 11th April 1928, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain, on the subject of the expulsion of the Hindu merchants from Qatif. I have nothing to add to Major Barrett’s report and would be glad if the King of Hejaz and Najd could be asked to rescind his order and that should the question require any discussion the merchants should be permitted to return to Qatif to recover their property and dues which will otherwise melt away. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India and (with a copy of my telegram No.80 of the 9 th instant) to His Majesty’s Consul, Jeddah, for Sir Gilbert Clayton. I have, etc., (signed) l.Haworth. Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf &amp; H.M’s Consul-General for Pars, Khuzistan, etc.The Hindus thereupon protested that they had considerable sums of money outstanding and a large quantity of goods in their warehouses, and asked what arrangements they should make about them. The Amir replied that they should appoint a looal trader as their agent to collect outstandings and dispose of their goods but the Bunniahs stated that it was impossible to obtain an agent. 5 . Two days later the Amir sent a man to warn the Bunniahd* that the Bahrain launch had arrived, The Bunniahs thereupon made a final personal appeal to Mahomed bin Bwailim about their goods and out standings and complained of the short notice that had been given them. The .^rnir, however, replied that it was for them to decide whether to appoint an agent or not; that they must go to Bahrain that day, but could come back after two days to appoint an Agent. Ratanmal and Maganmal accordingly left Qatif by launch about 2 p.m. on Saturday 31st March. The Amir sent his fidawi, Mutrij, to see that they actually embarked. 4&gt;. The Bunniahs inform me that until the sudden order for their expulsion the relations between them selves and the Amir and merchants of Qatif had invariably been friendly. They always carried out the jnir’s orders and imported the goods he required. They consider the charge that Lalumal had abusing people somewhat belated considering that this individual had left Qatif for India 45 days before it was made. 6 . The5 . The outstandings in the hands of various Qatif debtors amount to Rs.20 f 0Q0/- while 200 tins of ghee valued at Rs.6,000/- and 4,000 bags of rice valued at Rs.70,000/- have been left in the Bunniah’s warehouses at Qatif. The goods are stored in two big buildings, the property of Hassan bin Ali Marzuk and of Haji Hassan bin Salat. The goods are in rooms each of which is padlocked, but there is no special watchman over the warehouses other than the ordinary town guard. 6. The Bunniahs can give no reasons for their expulsion other than those already mentioned. They stated, however, that Pahad, the son of Shaikh nbdullah bin Jilawi of Rasa, was expected to come to Qatif on tour after a day or two to inspect his father’s estates. Pahad would probably be accompanied by some Akhwans but they did not think his visit had any bearing on the orders for their deportation. It is a possibility, however, that this visit may have had some connection with the short notice to quit given by Bin fcuwailim and his suggestion that a brief visit might be paid later. I hear from Haji rJamed bin Khamis, a leading Bahraini, that the Amir sent for Shaikh ali al-Khanaizi, the Shiah leader, and directed him to pray in his own house and not in public at the mosque during the time Bin Jilawi’s Akhwan &amp;rt in Qatif• It would appear therefore that he dreads the possible results of idchwan fanaticism. Haji Ahmed himself is of opinion that the Bunniahs(23&gt; Bunniahs were expelled as they are British subjects and it was feared that their presence might give His Majesty’s Government an excuse for interference. 7. I enquired from Abdullah al-Qusaibi as to whether he had any information about the cause of the expulsion and he replied that he understood that the Baharaneh, i.e. the Shiahs of Qatif - the population is wholly Shiah - have brought false charges against the Hindus. He considered the exclusion of the Hindus was a very bad move on the part of the Qatif authorities as they paid Rs.40,000/- in Customs dues, and apart from them there was not a trader in Qatif who could command a capital of Rs.1,000/-. The latter part of Qusaibi’s statement is an exaggeration, but it is a fact that the native Qatifi traders are all small men. The Bunniahs themselves state that they pay one lakh of rupees yearly to the Qatif Customs House. It is obvious that a very considerable portion of the trade of Qatif was in their hands. It happened that Abdullah cjusaibi was on the point of paying a visit to Qatif. I asked him to enquire as to the reason for the action taken against the Hindus. He has. He has just returned to Bahrain and reports that the Amir disclaims all responsibility for the affair. He was merely carrying out the written orders of Bin Saud himself. He says that a number of Qatifis sent a petition to Bin &amp;aud com plaining against the Bunniahs and that thereupon His Majesty, without any enquiry, ordered their expulsionbeing under the impression, apparently, that they were traders who had just arrived. Bin Duwailim promised to show Qusaibi the orders he had received but did not do so. 9 . Qusaibi says that there is no doubt that Bin Suwailim would willingly receive the Hindus back, but he is not a free agent in this matter. The order came to him from Ibn Baud himself through Bin Jilawi of liasa and he is bound to carry it out. He has however permitted the two Hindu s to return to Qatif for one week to clear up their accounts. He realises that this time is very short but he cannot do anything more. He hopes that it may be possible to obtain permission for the return of the Bunniahs for twc months during the date season, i.e. July and August, but oannot promise that his request in this matter will be granted. 10. In the circumstances, as the persons deported are undoubtedly British subjects I recommend a formal protest against the deportation should be lodged and that His Majesty the King of Najd should be asked to permit their return to Qatif. As His Majesty is leaving Riyadh for Jedda an opportunity to make the protest, if His Majesty’s Government should consider it advisable, will soon offer. If the permanent presence of the Hindus at Qatif is repugnant to His Majesty I venture to suggest that he may be asked to grant them permission to visit Qatif for two months annually, and also in the present case to give them permission to remain a sufficient■MMi time themselves to collect their outstandings and all their goods. If they had been expelled on the complaint of trade rivals they would naturally prefer not to hand over their affairs to one of the very community that has compassed their downfall. 11. The Bunniahs state that six months will be required to clear up the situation. This appears to me to be an excessive demand but if approval is granted to the principle perhaps it may be possible to leave the settlement of the actual period in the hands of the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the .uair of Qatif. In this connection I venture to invite the Political Resident’s attention to the recommendation in paragraph 6 of my No .^# dated li+th December 1927* 12. The Bunniahs claim that they have been trading with Qatif for hundreds of years though they admit temporary interruptions. The present traders have been resident in Qatif for four years.mmam 59092/28. TXLSGRAM from the Secretary of 3tate for the bolonies to the Resident at Bushlre. (oant 5.50.p.m. 18th April, 1928.)

I have the honour to refer to my telegram Mo. 76, dated the 2brd instant. 2. Several men of the Hindu community in Bahrain cane to see me during the afternoon of Thursday,2brd February, to inform me that they had just received a communication from their caste men in Qatif to say that they had been given eight days’ time, of which two had already expired, tc close their accounts, collect out standings and leave Qatif. My informants had no further information to give and enquired whether any political measure inspired this order. 1 replied that 1 knew of none. The Bunniahs did not press the matter. I think they are genuinely mystified by the order. Mr. Ghanshamdas has today informed me that the Bunniahs have been given an extension of time in Qatif, up to one month. There are only two firms in Qatif,probably four individuals and possibly some servants. b. In accordance with the precedent of 1925 (see Captain Mali am's Mo. 6b, dated 13th July) I have taken no action except to ask the Bahrain Customs authorities not to take immediate steps to recover full rates on the re-export cargo lying in Bahrain awaiting shipment to Qatif. 4. In 1925 the expulsion of Bunniahs appears to have been due to the rapacity of Bin Baud’s Governor who adopted this means of squeezing them. In a recent case before me, it can© out that Lalchand the Bunniah who was alleged to have defamed in Qatif certain Arabs, paid Rs.1100/- cash and gave presents worth Rs.1257-5-0 as Khidam© Khidam and deductions from grain business. Thus the total bribe to the Governor of Qatif, which procured him permission to return was Rs. 2529-5-0. I suggested to Mr. Ghanshamdas that he might use the key which was so successful in opening the door of Qatif on the former occasion. He replied that it was all very well once in a way, out was liaole to become too costly. 5. I was at first doubtful whether the present expulsion was due to an attempt at extort ion, or to orders from Bin Baud who hoped by this means to put some slight pressure on His Majesty’s Government.

Mr.Amery would deprecate burdening Sir G. Claytons very difficult and critical mission with issues which are not of first importance, and the expulsion of two Indian merchants regrettable though the under secretary, of state INDIA OFFICE. I wit may be cannot, in Mr.Amery’s opinion, be hel£ to fall within this category or to demand the intervention of a special emissary and plenipotentiary.

My despatch of 2nd March No, 9. following from Bahrein begins;- Two Bunniahe comprising the whole of British Goirraunity were turned out ^atif by ? Gorernor Ibn Baud on Saturday 1st April and arrired at Bahrein 2nd A &gt;ril leaving behind claims amounting Rs.20,000 and 4,000 bags of sugar and rice and 200 tins of GHI locked in warehouses. Total value of claims and property Hs.96,000. Owing to short notice to quit Bunniahs were unable to appoint agent to protect their interests. They claim redress for expulsion without cause and ask for protection of their property. I recommend that case be brought to the notice of Ibn Saud. Allegations against Bunniahs are said to be firstly Bunnlahlaluraa 1 who had left Cfcatif 45 days before order of exnui.ion used to abuse people, secondly Bunniahs imported large quantities of sugar and rice and so cut out local merchants.

My telegram No. 79. I would be glad if the case which has no religious significance could be referred to Bin Saud by Clayton under Article 5 of Treaty of Jeddah. Bin Saud's policy is to place trade in the hands of his own people (and then only of a limited number) for instance at Bahrein local traders cannot obtain agents on the mainland and so cannot compete in export trade t Hasa from Bahrein. Hindus hare probably been expelled by local ? gowernor for similar (group omitted! on the receipt of letter from Political Agent at Bahrein I will send despatch on the subject with cony to Clayton.

(Received Colonial Office 2.58 p.m. 2nd March, 1928.) Addressed to Colonial Office No. 58 repeated to Government of India, Baghdad No. 286. Hindu merchants trading in Katif have been ordered to leave. A report has been received from the political Agent at Bahrein stating that this measure has been taken, he believes in the merchants 1 own interests in order to save them from fanaticism of the Akhwan. _one will admit, but. ther the -'-rab Coast that are uch more inhumane, and the murder oi a Shaikh is only a symptom of a primitive state of affairs from which development must be gradual and which cannot be altered oy the mere suppression of that symptom. Though there may be possicly some sympathy for the first Shaikh, it is difficult to feel any for his successors in the blood stained line. They know exactl./ the contract they are taking on. As a matter of policy tne results of inter ference in successions are vary clearly set forth in paragraph 3 of despatch Wo. lb of i9£7. If a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be adopted, the only corollary is practical annexation. Arabia is by no means exempt from the changed conditions of thought throughout the world, and the only hope of improvement seems to lie in the development along the Arab Coast of better appreciation of the sanctity of human life and the advantages of social stability. So long as these violent changes do not affect th^ lives ana security of British subjects, 1 fail go see the necessity of viewing them too strictly from the point of vie?; of an alien school of thought. 4. As regards tne ider question of our general policy on the Arabian side, I feel that with the shorf period of my tenure here and the small opportunity I have had owing to difficulties of transport of studying on the spot the problems existing there, any views I express can only be of value cS the result oi the application of a perfectly fresh outlook on conditions entirely novel to an experience of aoministr - tion under conditions in many ways similar, gained on the Indo-Afghan frontier.
