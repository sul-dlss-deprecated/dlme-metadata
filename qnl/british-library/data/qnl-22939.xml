Dated, 4th B/Thany 1351 6 AUG 1932 H. 3. IVs Political xxgent, Bahrain. Sir, although up till now no application has been made by the Imperial Airways for a lease from the Government of Bahrain of a Landing '/round in Muharraq^ I understand unofficially that they are about to apply for one. as I shall be absent from Bahrain for about a month it is likely that their application may be made before I return so after having discussed the matter very fully with ji. Shaikh Hamcsa I am writing this to acquaint you of the feeling oi this Government on the subject. If you will refer to the correspondence leading to the leasing of the present aerodrome to the R.A^F., you will see that the original rent which was asked was Rs 2500,/- per annum, in itself a comparatively small sum, but it was finally agreed, on the request of the Political Agent that as a particular concession to the R.A.J , this sum should be reduced to £1:30, - per annum; it was pointed out to H. 111. Shaikh Eamad that the was a branch of His Majesty's forces on whom the external security and the protection oi Bahra3 -2- Bahrain to some degree depended; in view of these argument the amount was reduced. I understand that the R .A .F. are acting on behalf of the Imperial Airways Go. in this and other matters and it is they who are likely to approach this Govern ment for a lease. In spite of this it should be understood that they cannot expect to obtain terms for the commercial company,for whom they are acting,similar to those which were granted to themselves. Altnough li. S. Shaikh Hamcd is pleased that the Air Line should come to Bahrain he cannot allow to them such conces sion as he granted to the ^ir Force. In section 9 of the ^ir Force lease of the present Aerodrome it is stated that if the Shaikh gives notice to the R.ii.F^he will provide a landing ground, if in Muharraci, free of rent; but in this case there is no question of the Shaikh terminating the agreement. Should such an event occur in the future it will be possible to reserve ample room for still another Landing Ground on Muharra^q, island. Ii, E. Sheikh Hamad bein : aware of the possibility of other Air companies adopting this route wishes to retain the right to permit aeroplanes, other than those of the Imperial Airways, to use the Landing ground, in which case he retains the right to fees, payable to the Bahrain Government for each landing. Imperial Airways would also be allowed to charge fees for use of any buildings etc. which they should erect; other wise the lease would be generally upon the same lines as that of the R.ii.F.

He said he was leading by 1 ednesday^s air mail for home and had something which he wished to discuss with youjbut that if he had to leave the iano and stay behind he would lo. se a week at a time when every day was recious t nd A whether it would be possible for you to come to the aerodrome. I asked him how long it would take to discuss his business and he said about 10 minutes. I replied that I felt sure that if ixc telegraphed to you^that you that you would agree to coi^e to see him in view of the urgency of his business. i found that he had given Belgrave a preliminary draft of the agreement between the State and Imperial Airways and so I too* the opportunity to take a copy for myself and the Residency,in case you have not got one already. I should like to discuss this matter with you when I come to Bushire and will have my file sent to meet i* me in Bushire and also ask Belgrave for his views. 4. he agreement seems comparatively inocuous but four articles require careful consideration: Article 8 proposes to give Imperial Airvays the benefit of free customs on account of the great benefit they are conferring on the State by coming there. The Air Co i oaore expatiated on the benefits which would accrue to Bahrain from their passage,so I pointed out to him tnat they were coming to ^ahrain purely in their own interests and withIG no idea of benefitting the State and that unless they could hold out some quid pro quo it would b. very difficult to ailow this as a «i»WreiP of the highest importance was involved. As you know the State lives by its customs and once we give Imperial Airways this concession the R.A.F would immediately dejuand it .to say nothing of other air lines operating round the Arabian coast. There are also other considerations which i will ^oint out on | my arrival. article 10. This exempts goods in transit through Bahrain from customs and transit duties, .^t present a-.l goods in transit ^ay 2^ transit dues. I thin*: however,that the State wouxd at,ree to waive this as tiiCy could hardly expect ewtUzln articles destined for India and Australia to ^ay transit ^uty. and It will.howcver/be a concession la Im erial Airways will have to realise this. Article 15.concerning other air companies. This section requires some study. Incidentally I learnt from a chance remark of the Air Commodore that the Air Ministry might oppose any other air line using this route. This point is interesting. Here again the poipt of customs will have to be considered. Article 16. A free aerodrome in J^uharraq on account of the ^reat benefits the Company confer on Bahrain. One might As equally reply that Bahrain is conferring tfce great benefit on the Company by allowing it to come there and so far as I reinember the Adviser is o. posed to a free aeroarome in Luharraq. it will be remembered that the R.A.F ori^ina^ly i anted a free aeroarome in Manama. In fact I may say everybody .ho has any- Uiing to do with Bahrain,from Bin Saud ao^nards,wants to be on the iree list,a fact vhich causes Belgrave much embarrassment. Unless I hear to the contrary from you I will assume taiat this agreement maj/ be discussed on my arrival in Bushire. t will be noticed that there is no mention of the agency throughout the agreement or any provision for arbitration by the j olitical Resident. i would suggest however, that the Agency kee^s out of these activities as far as possible.GOVERNMENT OP INDIA; — D epaeiment.' vt EXPRESS LETTER \_2i.7j.

BAHRAIN.From To No. 529/29 of 1351 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, 26th J/Awal, 1351 Sept .26th, 1932 The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Persian Gulf. il. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that while in London last month I had several interviews with the Managing Director and the chief officials of the Imperial Airways Company and discussed with them the question of their using Bahrain as an air port. I pointed out to them that the Company should have made an official application to the Government of Bahrain which up to that time they had not done and a day or two before I left England a draft agreement between the State of Bahrain and the Company was forwarded to me for consideration and for revision or signature according to H. E. Shaikh Hamad•s wishes. A copy of the agreement is with you. On my return to Bahrain I discussed the matter with H. E. Shaikh Hamad who expressed the following views on the subject. ru*- agreement is, I believe, based on other agree- # mentsbetweenthe Companyand various foreign States-2- States and the conditions seem to be appropriate with the exception of certain articles. It is suggested that the agreement end the lease of the Aerodrome should be kept separate, therefore in ARTICLE 3, assuming that Maharaq Aerodrome is used, the wording should read as follows:- 'Aerodrome at Maharaq or on the aerodrome at Maharaq which is leased by the Imperial Airways Company by the Bahrain Government.... ARTICLE 6(c). Only travellers from abroad whose destination is Bahrain need obtain visas for admittance into Bahrain, so, 'all travellers coming from abroad' should be changed to 'all travellers from abroad who are disembarking in Bahrain'. The State considers it unnecessary for officials of the Company, such as pilots, stewards who form part of the crew of the machines to obtain visas for Bahrain, their position would be similar to officers and crew of ships who are, I think, usually exempted from such rules. ARTICLE 8. The State cannot agree to this article nor to No. 9 which depends upon the preceding one, ARTICLE 10. The State is prepared to concede to this concession though it should be borne in mind that in many other countries goods in transit are liable to Customs duties in the case of air commerce. ARTICLE 12. The State will allow the use of wireless telegraphy provided that it in no way inter feres with the Imperial and Internation Communication, Ltd T s installation. ARTICLE 15. This is complicated by various points. If the Royal Air ii'orce use the Maharaq aerodrome, as well-3- well as the Imperial Airways Company, which is a pos sibility under consideration, I understand that they would object to its being used by any foreign company. The State insists on reserving the right to allow foreign companies or single machines to land in Bahrain and the right also to charge them such fees as it con siders suitable. The State has no objection to the Imperial Airways Company supplying fuel, oilai, food etc., provided that it supplied at a reasonable charge, not at a prohibitive rate which would tend to keep off rival companies. In Europe there is a special subsidiary company which caters for many of the aerodromes and does the services which the Imperial Airways offer to provide here. The sole right granted to the Imperial Airways Company should apply only to the aerodrome that they lease from the Bahrain Government in Maharaq, and should not necessarily apply to any other aerodrome that might be rented by a foreign company in Bahrain island or some other part of the Maharaq plain, although presum ably it is unlikely that other companies would wish to make separate aerodromes. This article should include some such additional statement as 'on behalf of the Government any fees or landing dues which shall be imposed by the Government on any machines using the aerodrome except those of the Imperial Airways Company.' When discussing this agreement with the Officer Commanding, Flying boat squadron, Busrah, I was informed that the Royal Air Force would perhaps have some opinions to express about ARTICLE 15.ARTICLE 16. The State cannot agree to this and proposes to charge such rent as it considers reasonable for any aerodrome which may be selected. It is suggested, if the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf approves, that a final clause should be inserted similar to those in various other agreements made by this G-overnment appointing him as an arbitrator for interpreting the meaning of the terms of the agreement and for settling any dispute between the parties. H. E. Shaikh Hamad is definitely of the opinion that he cannot possibly agree to articles 8 and 16. In connection with these two articles he compares the position of Shargah and Bahrain; at the former place the Imperial Airways Company was received with dislike and suspicion, but there they are making a very handsome payment to the local Government; in Bahrain they have been afforded assistance and encouragement and it is not unreasonable that they should be required to pay the usual Customs duties on their imports similarly to other commercial firms and to pay rent for an aerodrome.

You will scarcely credit it,but although the r.a.f have been supplied with accurately surveyed maps of the aerodrome # they nave not given one of their many copies to Imperial airways and all they have is an inaccurate and misleading sketch drawn by Gal^in. 3.

Article 3, Since the State intend to charge for the use of an aerodrome at Muharraq, they suggest that this agreement and the lease of the aerodrome should be kept separate, and suggest that the wording sKould be altered to read as follows:* aerodrome at Manamah or on the aerodrome at Muharraq which is leased to thh Imperial Airways Company by the Bahrain Government ••••••••• M 3* Article 6 (cK ®he State view is that since through passengers will not be landing in Bahrain, they will not require vizas and they suggest that ^all travellers com ing from abroad' should be changed to 'all travellers from abroad who are disembarking in Bahrain'. The State do not ccnsider •••-2- consider it necessary for crews of plar^e^ to obtain visas for Bahrain on the analogy of officers and crews of ships who are at present exempted, I understand that some reference has bjaen made by the Foreign Office to the question of risas for through passengers and a reference might be made to it. 4. The State are quite unable to accept Article 8 and consequently Article 9 which arises out of it, They are quite unable to give any concession in the matter of customs dues other than the one which is indicated below* I understand that the State view is that they depend entirely on their customs have been income for their existence, and they autn/constantly pressed to grant exemptions which they have hitherto invariably refused. The delicate financial condition of the State is of course well-known to you. 5# Article 10. The State are prepared to give a con cession in this matter although it is contrary to their funda mental policy that all goods passing through Bahrain should pay per cent, and they arc willing to exempt goods in transit tbrough Bahrain in the Company's aircraft from customs dues. r ^iQ^-e 12&gt; The State have no objection to the introduction of wireless by the Company provided that it inter feres in no way with the existing service of the Imperial and international Coraauni cat ions Limited# ^he i at« are prepared to give Imperial Airways the concession they desire in this Section but they insist on reser^ ving the ri^it to allow foreign companies or single machines to land in Bahrain and also the r i^it to charge such landing fees 8 ey consider desirable. This would apply to the lluharraq aerodrome •Muld Imperial Airways lease it. It is their proposal to charge Imperial Airways rent for this aerodrome and ^ to ise- it and in return to 1 charge them no landing fees but to levy such on foreign planes that use it as they pass-3- 3! pass through* The Bahrain Government suggest that this Article should include some such additional statement as * on behalf of the Government and to collect on behalf of the Government any fees or landing dues which have been imposed by the Government on any machines using the aerodrome except those of the Imperial Airways'. 8. Article 16 « The Bahrain Govermment are unable to agree to free use of an aerodrome on ICuharraq Island and pro pose to charge them a rental similar that charged for the Manamah aerodrome, cut are willing to grant an area of greater extent* It should be remembered in this connection that water can be found anywhere beneath the surface of this area by artesian wells, and the Shaikh is constantly receiving applications from his relations for gifts of land in this locality. 9• There is no mention of arbitration in the agreement and the Bahrain Government desire that a clause should be inserted in it empowering the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to arbitrate should he be good enough to accept the office. I recommend this suggestion since many similar points are likely to arise from time to time which may require an authoritative interpretation. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servr-nt Ocpt.f Political Agent, Bahrain.v&gt; conftdwitifcl. \v&gt;i iio.7aa.ii or ix32.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on 12th September 1932 I wrote to Air Commodore Fletcher, G.M.G., M.C., of the Imperial Airways informing him that this government was willing to allow the Company to use the Maharaq Aerodrome for one month from date of first landing during which time nego tiations for the lease were to be discussed. The month expired on 12th October 1932, but in the mean time we have received no application for an extension. This should have been made. I have received another draft agreement from the London office of the Imperial Airways but cannot agree to it as the points regarding exemption from Customs and from rent of Aerodrome remain as originally stated. I suggest that the Company or the R.A.F., who are interested in the matter, should apply for an extension of the period. I have the honour to be, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government.44. I un the morning of the 31st uecember 1932 i saw Mr. Russell who came at my request to discuss matters connected with imperial Airways. • 2. 1 said that 1 thought Imperial Airways was one of our most important interests in the Persian liulf and that it would be sound for them to do all they could to consolidate their position before foreign competition started, 3. i said that apparently they had had a one month's temporary agreement which had expired on the 12th October 1932 and that the company was now running without any agreement at all. ne said that he thought that was being dealt with by air commodore Fletcher direct with the rsahrain vjovernment. i said that ± did not know what the latest development was but that i thought that the sooner a proper agreement was come to the better for all concerned. 4. i said that i would very much like to see the different banding grounds and that it would be sound if they could come to a decision abount the landing ground before an agreement was come to and i arranged to see the landing grounds in Manama on the 2nd January 1933 and will decide whether a reminder of other action is necessary after seeing them. ±t would be well for an migineering expert of imperial airways to see the landing ground so as to preclude another incident like that when the first 'Hannibal 11 arrived. 5. i asked whether they were having any Arabic notices or pamphlets prepared and he said that he thought that the publicity Agent of the company ,Mr. S.Snowden Gambal,was having some done, i said that i thought they ought to issue all the pamphlets ,especially the illustrated ones,in Arabic as soon as possible,so as to get the name of imperial airways familiar in people's minds before the coming of foreign lines, i added that it would be well to make mention of the conveniences 'offered to the pearl irade. 6. i said that i had given Major Brackley certain points which i had noted for the convenience of travellers on the4^ iLuropean section of the journey and asked whether he would like me to let him know of them, i mentioned to him the provision of rugs in the planes and suggested that in 'Hints to passengers' it should be recommended that ijady passengers should have their hot water bottles filled up before starting 1 also suggested a supply of still mineral water as the ordinary drinking water was often chlorinated and is most unpleasant, 7, Mr.Hussell mentioned that a trench Director of uivil aviation had passed through Just before i cama and i asked him to let me have the Director's name etc,, S. please put up any papers we have about his journey and whether he made any enquiries suggesting that the rrench Airways might come to this side of the Persian ^ulf. 31-12-1932.% H.C .

There will, I understand, be no difficulty about granting it for reasonable time pending' negotiation of permanent agreement. If State (or we) allow Imperial Airways to work without permission,it will make it difficult to insist on meticulous observance of formalities by foreign companies,should they come here, secondly, urgent steps should be taken by Imperial Airways: (a) to decide on site of permanent aerodrome,and (b) to conclude permanent agreement,which is now,I under stand, subject of negotiation between them and the ^ 8 * Hoyal Air Force and the uahrain Government.

Reference correspondence ending with Political Resident's Despatch Uo.821-3. of 1932, dated 29th October 1932, on the subject of the Draft Agreement 'between Messrs. Imperial Airways and Bahrein Oovernment for use of landing grounds at Bahrein. Oovernment of India are in general agreement with Poliuical Residents conments subject to following observations; (1) Article 6 (c). Re-draft suggested by Company may be accepted subject to following modifications. Words ^other than employees of Company* should be omitted and following addition made at end. 'All other travellers including employees of Company must be in possession of valid national passports which they must produce if so required to the Passport Control Officer.* (2) Articled® and 9. We understand that it is universal practice to exempt from customs duty petrol and oil imported solely for purpose of refuelling aeroplanes for flight to other countries. If this is the case we think that Bahrein Oovernment should be asked to grant customs concession to this limited extent. (3) Articles 15 and 16. Bahrein Oovernment are clearly unwilling to agree to imperial Airways proposal that they should pay neither the landing fees nor rent and for reasons given in paragraph/ 8 of Political Resident's despatch No.788-3., dated the 18th October 1932, we do not consider that we are justified in pressing further for this concession. In our view the most convenient arrangement will be for the CoMpany to take- 2 - no lease of the aerodrome but to receive authority from Bahrein Government to aot as managers of aerodrome in accordance with such general conditions as to its use 'by other aircraft as Bahrein Government may decide to impose. These conditions will presumably include the payment of landing fee Tsy other aircraft which it will 'be the duty of Imperial Airways to collect on 'behalf of the Bahrein Government as managers of the aerodrome. In order that too obvious discrimination in their favour may not 'be made Imperial Airways might pay in lieu of rent as lease holders a consolidated landing fee of £120/- which compared with scale of landing fees charged by Government of India represents a considerable concession. If above proposal is agreed to the first half of Company*s re-draft of Article 15 will need amendment by omission of words 'and hereby grants them authority to prescribe the conditions under which the aerodromes may be used by other aviators' 1 and substitution of some appropriate wording which will leave this authority with the Bahrein Government. Article 16 will also require amendment in order to provide for the payment of a consolidated landing fee arranged. Mention of a lease in Article 3 as suggested by the Political Resident must also be omitted. (4) Article 19. We agree that Political Resident should be designated as the arbitrator in case of dispute. -J IIMPERIAL AIRWAYS Telephone : ZEITOUN 12 97/e 13 /BCrc / M S3 L I Kl I T E r) HELIOPOLIS AERODROME HELIOPOLI5, EGYPT.

I am asking the leading shops in Cairo to send you their catalogues.

In the light of the views of the Resident and the -ovemment of India, the Secretary of State has the following comments to make on the draft Agreement. For convenience of reference a fair copy of the draft Agreement, amended to include the revised paragraphs 5, 6(c) (as proposed by the -ovemment of India), 11 and 15, and the additional Article 19, in the form apparently accepted by the ^ofnpany, reported in Bushire Despatch No.821-3 of 29th October 1932, is enclosed. Preamble. ' It seems desirable on general grounds that His Majesty's Government should retain a close control over any arrangements for the grant of air facilities in Bahrein or the other Arab principalities of The Secretary, the/ Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, ¥.0.2.9^) ' the Persian Gulf, and the Secretary of State would suggest that the ?;ords 'with the approval of His Majesty's Government' should be inserted after the words 'Government of Bahrein' in line 1 of the enclosed text. Article 5 , The Secretary of State considers the redraft of this Article suggested by the State, as reported in paragraph 2 of Captain Prior's letter of 13th October enclosed in Bashire despatch No.788-S of 18th October to the Governrre-it of India, an improvement, and would accept it in preference to the original. Article 6 . Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary oi boate accepts this article with the omission in the first sub paragraph of the words 'other than employees of the Company' and the addition of a sub-paragraph in the modified form surrested by the Government of India, viz: 'All other I travellers, including employees of the Company, must be in possession of valid national passports which they must produce if so required to the Passport Control Otficer . Articles 8 and 9 . The Secretary oi State agrees with the Government of India tnat if it is universe 1 practice to exempt from customs duty petrol and oil ijiported solely for the puroose of refuelling aeroplanes for flight to other countries, the Bahrein Government should be asked to -rant a customs concession to this limited extent. Subject to this he accepts the objections of the Bahrein State to exempting Imperial Airways from customs duties, save in respect of dues on articles in transit in ohe aircraft of Imperial Airways through Bahrein. The financial condition of the State is far from satisfactory; its consent to the grant of facilities at Bahrein to Imperial Airways is essential to/ ■to the operation of the {service; the local embarrassments which may arise from the grant of any such exceptional concession may well be serious; and the objections seen by the State to the Company's proposal are, in his view, in these circ'jmstances reasonable. Article 10 . If Articles 8 and 9 are emitted, the remaining articles of the Agreement will need renumbering, and the opening words of Article 10 revision. Article 12. The Secretary of State sees no objection to this Article, subject to the reservation made by the State that the wireless operated by the Company shall in no way interfere with the existing service of Imperial and Interna tional Canmuni cat ions Ltd. It is however for consideration whether a proviso to this effect (which would incidentally cover the wireless installations referred to in Article 13) should not be added. Article 15 . While, as the Resident points out, the question does not directly arise on the present Agreement, the Secretary of State wishes to take this opportunity to indicate his entire agreement with the view of the Resident that it is most desirable that the right to permit foreign air companies to use Bahrein should in practice (subject, of course, to the formal concurrence of the Sheikh) be in the hands of His Majesty's Government. IJftiile he sees no objection to this Article in its present revised form, he is inclined to think it desirable, particularly having regard to the difficulties which are likely to arise in connection with the use of these aerodromes by foreign ccmpanies, to insert in the third line after the word 'prescribed' the words 'subject to the approval of the Government of Bahrein and on behalf of that Government.' Article 16 .Article 16 . It is important in this matter to safeguard the financial interests of the Sheikh and the Secretary of State agrees with the Government of India that it would not be possible to urge the Bahrein Government to agree to the proposal of Imperial Airways that they should pay neither landing fees nor rent. The Secretary ef State would be glad of the views cf the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and of the Air Council cn the question however, of a definite lease or of an arrangement of the nature suggested by the Government of India. In any case, he considers that having regard the arrangements made with the Sheikh «f Shargah it would be preferable that, as at Shargah, a charge of Rs.5 for each aeroplane tf Imperial Airways landing, etc. on the aerodrcme should be made, subject to a yearly minimum of £120. It is for consideration also whether some provision should not be included in the Agreement which would enable the question if rent to be re-examined, say, at the expiry of 5 years. The concession granted by the State is a valuable one and it is possible that with the increased use of this route conditions may so change as to render the financial arrangements suggested unsatisfactory from the point of view of the State. As regards foreign aricraft, he would leave it open to the State to fix (subject to the approval of the Political Resident) such landing fee, whether the same as or one higher than that required from Imperial Airways, as they may think fit. On a minor point, the Article as at present drafted does not make it clear whether it is prcposed to give Imperial Airways any rights in respect of arrangements for civil aircraft landing, etc. on the Royal Air F*rce aerodrome at Manama. If Muharraq only is in issue then certain verbal alterations will be necessary. Article 19.(ir 0 Article 19. The Secretary of State notes that the State have requested that the Political Resident should be appointed as arbitrator. Sir Samuel Hoare agrees with the Government of India that the Resident would be the most convenient authority to arbitrate any dispute and he would suggest that specific provision for this should be made in the .Agreement. 3. Subject to the modifications suggested above and to any comments which the Foreign Office or the Air Council may desire to make, the Secretary of State is prepared to accept the agreement as suitable. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office. I aiu, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sdg O. WALTOBU101 P.Z.231/33 REVISED DRAFT.

D«ar Bertr»! tt I very maoh re^et that I have not been able to write to you earlier on the aubject of our npposed ^eement with the Bahrein Government, which wa* diwcuased at our meetly at Gwydyr iiouae on the Sond January. In re^rd to Articled of the draft agroement, there is no objection to the anen iment as ougRestpd, but since there appears to tie sorr*} oBHibility of another aerodrome site proving Utber than the existing two, mi^it we leave the article to read:- 'Jslvery aircraft of the Company arriving; in Bahrein fror. ah ill Xcuvd either Jit i.he oyai Air Force aerodro&amp;e at , an amah or on the aerodrome at . uharraq or elsewhere as 3. a he question f whether tlse aerodrome at ' uharraq should be leased to Imioerial Airway^ or not, can perhaps be entirely or itted fror thia article, as it doe?? not, in fact, affect the afx^roent. ■h in regard to article 6 (c), we have no objection whatever to employees of the Company who are not disembarking at Bahrein belrv required to produce to the passport control officer valid international passports. They will all be in ossession of valid oaasporta, which are needed for various forei/^i countries. the sane ti e, it woula be desirable from our point of view .if this requirement were not specified in the agreement, ar are anxious that the crews of mttrmationally o per at in, air companies shall be tre ited just as the crews of the are ercantile l&gt; trine, who, of courst^not required to produce pasaports when they are merely call in at a port. *Ve believeIN that in time thi« practice will becorae aniversal and we arc ■&lt;nxiou« to avoid mkint; its adoption difficult b&gt; the inclusion or such par igraphs in agrMWnU .hicn are being entered into. ^ 1 mwondering however if the wasted naregraph shoul not re .i,. lAnployees of the Uompnn/ Hisenbarkin/ at Bahrein* instead oi' nai dieeftbarking at Bahrein - 'nil alio be required to carry valid international paaeporte.' fi i, ihePe articles are, of course, the crux of th# whole matter with the Bahrein Uewenmt, and I ^nink, t.o ^ret th# matter clear, we ought to divide oar claim for exemption fro* eastoru duty into the three cla ^tea of which cow into the quoationi- U *™*r 'bivalent to th. &lt;b) »«nt to Bahrein for incorporation in a ■ JCr, ' f&gt; h,l!i in 3t ® c '* t ^ahr»in (0) etc - l ' port,,i int0 b,hr,in ^ 1 * hlnk it should bo ndn oloar, if it not already cl*.-yr to the Gorortmnt ofBrhrvi. , t/mt it is practically a uni'*r«al eueW t-o treat aircraft in rooxsct of fuel and oil ^n '&gt; &gt; tm# r-Kitin,m oio^iips for their coal or fuel ^ il; tiutt is J ..o ray that thf fuel con-jKod in oonin^: from or nine to n piano abroad ic exempt fro® customo mport duty. ^ &amp;iery journey by aii ircraft U) or from Bahrein will be a journey to or 'ror* a nl-ce abroad, and therefore under international cartom should be exempt from fuel and oil duty. . J - It if? true thr.t in rwmc forci.n countries, the fuel coneuned in rii ht between two places in the same territory is assessable to duty, and there is something to be said on this Bcore. but this cannot apply in any way to Bahrain, and we feel that exemption from duty on bunker fuel is the principle for which we muet press to the last resort. iihe siocond *proup of articles - parts for repair of our aircraft - cones very lar ely within the ear* general econe. It 18/*v is cormon for foreign countrie s that cannot be said to be m clo«e treaty rith (re at ritam and that are not bound to Great Britain by any oarticular tie , to i^rant this ©xemption, subject, of coarse, to suitable tafe^Mards to reet trs© respecti?c regiir^fl, and 'e feel th it if Bahrein, a country in sach close association ith reat Britain, should innose this duty, how could we argue af^inst it bein^ imposed by France, Italy, -reece, K^ypt, Palestine, Trans-Jordajn, Iraq, Baluchistan and India? 11 lo Bahrein it will probably be a comparatively tnviai amount ^ maidUe collected on thin score, but it would involve -m enorrous amount of unnecessary accounting work* 1 ^ Xfii ^ ^ cite as an example, an engine developin, a defect during its flifht between Uhar^^ah and liahrein, and it is thou ht desirable to send to Bahrein a new engine to take the r^lace of the old one, which would be imme lately nhipped to Basra for repair. il iITie value of the new engine we may assess at ^l,3u0. duty would be levied on this fipire, i.e., we sliould have to tmy 90. Within a few days the engine would be fitted and the jovernment ot :'/ah re in on the production of satisfactory proof that it had been incorporated in an aircraft, would re fun to us of the -90, i.e., because we have been so unfortunate aa to require to change an engine at Bahrein, it will have cost us ..36, plus all the bother through paying in the first place, provIn, the incorporation of the engine in the aeroplane, and obtain in a refund of ,.^4. i jith regard to the other fjroup of articles, for example, motor cars, motor boats and fuel used for than, fooo, furniture, household require ents for our resthoust, etc., etc. Ahile we do not think it in any way unrearonabie that we should ask or exemption from duty on these foo is, we appreciate that ■ hey o not cow into the sare cate^ry as the firet two classes.We neverthelesfi feel that rcfueal to ?^ree to freeuorn from duty on thc«e ^oodt ^howfl a rery definite change of front on the part of the Uo?ernment of iiahrein, who in 1929 offered ue a aabsic^r of i(apeeR a trip if we could see oar way to operate a senrics to hahrein. ^t the time this aubeidy was offered to an, it presumably wae not offered with the object of the subsidy beirv recovered from ue by way of import duties, coC*, -^:c. it. oet' *, thert,i ore, that a service th tt iiahrein valued at 2:X) (apess a trip in 1929 has now not only become of I no v«ilue to them, but is to be r ide to pay fees not then contemplated. •f ') a. )e(:i r ^ure that t.hjr ovorme 'Tt of .ahrein hate not a T^reciatftd the difference between the three classes of ^-oods for fhich we have aoolied for exemption from cusfone duty, and I ^ould be f^ratwfal if you could represent this matter to them somewhat on the lines of tne above.

Possibly all the difficulty ?oul &lt; be solved by the payment by tne 4ir Ministry o^ a prart to the Shaikh, and our Cairo answer seems to have gained the impression that an annual gr'tnt of :2ao would secure the ''uharraq aerodrome or other land and free us from fuel duty and duty on spare parts, etc. ^ ^ os^ibly it would be better for tne Political Resident to approach the matter m thiu way rather than to leave the Company to haa.le c ver fuel and oil and gpare parts* duty and rental o: the aerodrome, and it would obviously leave the British -ovemient in a much stronger position in regard to the 0 ' aero tiro ma bjf lor^ign air comnanies.

The main correspondents in the file are the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain Charles Geoffrey Prior until November 1932, Captain Percy Gordon Loch thereafter), the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle), and the Advisor for the Bahrain Government Charles Dalrymple-Belgrave. Other correspondents include representatives of the Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) and Imperial Airways Limited.Most of the papers in the file relate to the drawing up of an agreement between the Government of Bahrain and Imperial Airways, for the installation and use of an aerodrome in Bahrain. The first draft of the agreement, dated 31 August 1932, is included in the file (folios 9-13), and is followed by extensive correspondence where issues and revisions to specific articles are raised. These chiefly relate to the payment of customs duties on cargo travelling through Bahrain by air, and the use of aerodrome facilities by other, including foreign, operators, wireless facilities. Subsequent revisions of the agreement can also be found in the file (folios 39-41, 80-87, 101-07).The relative merits of landing strips at Manama and Muharraq in Bahrain are also discussed. Soil test analyses conducted by the R.A.F. suggest that the land at Muhurraq is better suited for larger aircraft (folio 142). A suitable gift for Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, to thank him for his co-operation in negotiations, is also discussed between government officials and representatives of Imperial Airways (folios 68, 139).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002e8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
