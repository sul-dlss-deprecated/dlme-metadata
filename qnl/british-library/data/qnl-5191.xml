Subject:- Elimination of annas in the accounts of the Contributory Provident Fund (India). I have tne honour to submit the following' suggestion for the consideration of tnu Government of India, 2. HuloS 8(l)(a) and (3), i0(6), ll(2)(iv) and 16(l) of the Rules regulating the Contributory Provident Fund (India) have been so framed as to exclude fractions of a rupee in the follow ing cases (1) subscriptions 5 rule 8(l)(a) J ; (2) contribution oayablc- b^ r Govornrnrn t 5 rule 10(6) J (3) interest payable on subscrir)tions and contributions 5 ruie 11(2)(iv) ij ; and (4) balance of monthly subscriptions payable after substi tution oi a part of it 1 or payment of p rc mi a 5 rule 16(i) i . It appears, therefore, that the. intention of the Government of India was that the accoutfnts of this fund should be simplified by maintaining th^m in whole rupees onlj 7 '. In tne absence of specixic rules and instructions, fractions of a rupee appear in the accounts due to the following causes (l) Withdrawal of money from the fund for payment of premia { Rule 15(6) and 16(2) (/ ; (^-) Opening balances on 1st April 1931 due to transfer of balances at the credit of some of the subscribers m the ^oneral Provident and other Funds. 3. In tix cas^o utider (i) fractions of a rupee may be ; avoided if tne suuscriucrs are paid in the nearest whole rupee in the manner provided in sub rule 3 of rule 8. 4. In the cases falling under (2), the fractions may b{ round ed oil 0 she rt or excess recovery durinr th^ current financial year. 5.

London, the (joverm ent of India have considered the question whether the grant of the bonus of i:.75 granted under rule 5(c) of the Legal Study Rules for reading in Chambers should not be made subject to the condition that it should be refunded to Government if the officer concerned does not rejoin duty after the expiration of his leave, llie Legal Study Rules and '-.he conditions in the form of bond prescribed under the Rules, as they stand, do not conver this bonus, which, when once paid is not recoverable. The Government of India, however, see no reason why public revenues should bear charges '^or the training of an officer if no benefit accrues to the State from that training, and consider that its recovery should be provided O or in certain circumstances. They have therefore amended the form of bond accordingly. 2. I am to enclose, for information, a copy of the form of bond, which will supersede that hitherto n force. TRUE COPY.

These rules replace in respect of those persons to whom they are made applicable by Rule 2 the correspondiner leave rules m the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules. The other rules in the fundamental and Supplementary Rules shall remain operative in the case of those persons except in so far as they may be inconsistent with or repugnant m subject or context to the Revised Leave Rules. To meet the difficulties that may arise m certain cases in the application of the remaining Supple mentary Rules to persons governed by the revised leave rules, the 'Governor General in Council is pleased to decide that leave on average pay not exceeding four months shall be taken to mean earned leave not exceeding 90 or 30 days as the case may be. Consequential amendments necessitated^by the revised leave rules in the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules will be issued in due course. 2. In recalculating the leave due or admissible, with retrospective effect under the revised leave rules the leave already taken or sanctioned under the -b undamental or Supplementary Rules shall be accounted for as follows {i) Leave on average pay, whether taken with or without medical certificate against ' earned leave ( m ) Leave on half average pay without medical certificate against leave on private affairs ' ; and 0 (m) leave on half average piy o:a mziiccU certificate against 44 leave on medical certificate'. Where leave under the Fundamental or Supplementary Rules has alreadv been enjoyed or is being enjoyed before the promulgation of the Revised Leave Rules, and the leave or leave salary taken or sanctioned exceeds that admissible under the revised leave rules, the excess of leave or leave salarv is hereby authorised. y For example ; (i) A, an officer who joined superior service on the 1st October 1931 has been granted not on medical certificate, four months leave on average pay coupled with two months leave on half average pay under the Funda mental Rules from the 1st August 1933. Two months of the leave on pay will be counted as earned leave under the revised rules, and the two months leave on half average pay will be counted as leave on private affairs The remaining two months leave on average pay will not be counted againstthe officer's leave account under the revised rules, nor will any recovery be made from him of the leave salary drawn for the period. The leave will expire on the 31st January 1934 as previously sanctioned. • {ii) B, an officer who joined superior service on the 1st August 1931 has been granted leave on half average pay outside Asia for ten months under the Fundamental Rules from the 1st November 1933. Nine months of this leave will be counted as leave on private affairs. The remaining one month will not be counted against the officer's leave account under the revised rules, nor will any recovery be made from him of the leave salary drawn. The leave will expire on the 31st August 1934. {Hi) C, an officer who joined superior service on the 1st September 1931 has been granted on medical certificate three months leave on average pay coupled with one month's leave on half average pay imder the Fundamental Rules from the 16th January 1933. One and a half months of the leave on average pay will be counted as earned leave under the revised rules, and one month's leave on half average pay will be counted as leave on medical certi ficate. The remaining one and a half months leave on average pay will not be counted against the officer's leave account under the revised rules, nor will any recovery be made from him of the leave salary drawn. {iv) D, an officer who joined superior service on the 1st February 1932, has been granted on medical certificate two months leave on average pay under the Fundamental Rules from the 1st January 1933. One month of the leave will be counted as earned leave under the revised rules.

The new procedure will take effect from the quarter commencing 1st January 1934 and therefore the Home Department is requested to issue urgent e tc orders to all Heads of Departments etc. under it that from now onwards each application for a grant from the Compassionate Fund should De accompanied by a descriptive roll (on separate sheets) of the applicant lor the award in addition to the particulars prescribed in the Appendix to the rules of the Fund. These rolls, should contain the following information;— (1) Height, (2) Age. (3) Colour.

MENT OF INDIA. 1. The Compassionate Fund is intended for the relief of the families of Government servants paid monthly from Central revenues, whether their rates of pay are fixed on a daily or a monthly basis, if they are left in indigent circumstances on account of the premature death of the person upon whom they depended for support. Its scope is limited to the dependants of those who served in or under :— (а) Civil Departments, including the Financial Adviser, Military Finance, and the Railway Department, but excluding the Posts and Telegraphs Department, (б) the Army and Marine Departments if they were subject to the Civil Service Regulations, or (c) Minor Local Governments and Administrations : Provided that no application will be considered from dependants of Govern ment servants who were subscribers to a contributory provident fund (including the State Railway Provident Fund) or come within the scope of the State Railway Gratuity Rules : Provided further that no application will be considered which is not submitted to the department of the Government of India concerned within one year of the death of the Government servant, unless the delay in submission is sufficiently ex plained. It is most desirable that applications should be submitted as promptly as possible after the death of a Government servant. The Fund is formed by an annual grant of Rs. 40,000, which is cumulative, the unexpended balance of each year's grant being carried forward for expenditure in succeeding years. The maximum limit of expenditure in any single year is Rs. 45,000. 2. The conditions which regulate a grant from the Fund are ;— (1) Grants from the Fund are restricted to cases of an exceptional character. (2) The deceased officer must have been a meritorious public servant. Unusually meritorious service gives special claim for consideration. (3) Death due to special devotion to duty establishes a strong claim for consideration. (4) In more ordinary cases preference should be given to the dependants of officers who have completed many years service and have just failed to draw their pension. (5) Other things being equal, preference should be given to those who have been on low rates of pay. (6) As a general rule a grant should not be given if the salary of the deceased officer exceeded Rs. 750 a month. (7) Assistance should 'seldom be given to families of gazetted officers except so far as it may be necessary to assist them to obtain a passage home. (8) Care should be taken that too many grants are not made to families of officers who have been serving at the headquarters of the Government of India. 3. The rules for sanctioning grants are :— (1) No pension is granted from the Fund, but in some cases yearly grants are made for a limited period to defray the expenses of the education of children. (2) The maximum gratuity payable in any individual case is Rs. 5,000. The precise amount in all cases is fixed according to the number in the family and the necessities of the case, the equivalent of a year's pay of the deceased being considered a suitable maximum in cases in which the circumstances are such as to require liberal treatment, but in most ordinary cases, six months' pay is regarded as sufficient.4. The Fund will be administered by a Committee appointed by the Govern ment of India which will meet, as at present arranged, once every three months. On receipt of an application in the Finance Department, the facts will be sum marised and put up without comment. The Committee's decision will be com municated by the Finance Department direct to the authority submitting the appli cation, the Department concerned and the Accountant-General, Central Eevenues, If payment is to be made to a person resident in England, the Finance Department will also address the India Office for the payment to be made. 5. Cases relating to grants from the Compassionate Fund will not be sub mitted to His Excellency the Viceroy.APPENDIX. The following particulars should be furnished in each case of recommendation for the grant of an award from the Compassionate Fund ;— (1) Name of the deceased, last appointment held ; pay at time of death and the date of death. (2) Total service (whether pensionable or non-pensionable). (3) Dependants (with their respective ages) and their pecuniary* circumstances. Whether there are any relatives in a position to give help. (4) Remarks of superior officer on deaceased's work. (5) Was death due to, or accelerated by, devotion to duty ? (6) Recommendation of Department, etc., regarding amount of grant. (7) Name of the treasury at which payment is desired. (8) General. * If the deceased was a subscriber to the General Provident Fund and/or was insured, the amount of his deposits in the Fund and/or the amount for which he was insured should be mentioned.

RESOLUTION. New Delhi, the 7th December 1933. No. F.-7-(50)-R. 1/33.— The Government of India have had occasion to examine the rule in clause (2) (b) of section V of the Adminis trative Instructions issued with this Department Resolution No. 205-C. S. R., dated the 8th February 1924, which regulates the grant of casual leave on account of absence from duty, due to the presence of infectious diseases in the family or household of a Government servant. The rule has been found to be defective in certain respects. In the first place it gives no clear indication of the extent to which leave may be sanctioned in the circumstances men tioned ; nor does it provide for such leave being prefixed to ordinary leave, when the grant )f the latter in continuation is necessary. In the second place, the rule does not state clearly whether, when absence from duty exceeds the period which may reasonably be treated as casual leave, it is the excess over the period considered reasonable or the entire period of absence that should be sanctioned as ordinary leave. • , 2. It is considered that, though tbe I^ave granted on account of the presence of infectious diseases in the family of a Government servant is not debited in his leave account, it should be distinguished from casual leave for tne reason that the latter is granted at the request ol tne Government servant, while the former is not. The Governor General in Council has accord ingly decided to designate such leave in future as 'Quarantine Leave'. He has also decided to limit the grant of this leave ordinarily to 21 days, this limit being increased in exceptional circumstances to 30 days. He has further decided that if absence for reasons of quarantine exceeds the maximum of 21 days, or in excep tional cases 30 days, the excess onl^ should be sanctioned as ordinary leave and that once quarantine leave has been sanctioned as such, its character should not be changed, as a result of the grant of such ordinary leave in continua tion. 3. The amendments to the rule necessary to give effect to these decisions are published in the annexure to this resolution. O rdered that the Resolution be published in the Gazette of India. A. A. L.

Subject:- Proposal to alter the classification of officers for purposes of railway travel in Great Britain and Northern anacitx Ireland, { &amp; With reference t o llr .Gr ist* s letter No .F • 2437/33, dated the 15th May 1933, on the subject noted above, I am directed to say that after consulting the local Governments and other authorities the Government of Inaia agree to the privilege of first class travel in Great Britain and Northern Ireland being restricted, in the case of civil officers Then on duty in the United Kingdom, to those in receipt of a pay of £1000 inclusive per annum and over. It has been suggested by certain authorities that the proposed change should be extended to travel in Europe including the Hear East and America ; but it seems that the change in the rules in England has only been made with reference to travel in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that the Secrst-iry of State's intention is presumably to 1 i lit the change in the case of officers on duty from India to the same areas. I am, hov/ever, to enquire whether the restriction will apply to travel in the Irish Free State, and also what classifi cation is to apply in the case of military officers in civil employ e.g. those in the Political Department, the Survey of India Department, etc. The Government of India are of opinion that it will cause an invidious distinction with the civil officers in the departments in which these military officers serve if the latter are to be governed by their military rank. They therefore suggest that a military officer in civil employ should be governed by the same criterion of pay as would apply to civil officers. I am also to observe that, if the decision communicated in the letter under reference, is extended to civil pfficers employed under the Army Department^ther than those of the Indian Services enumerated in the schedule under SupplementaryMidi iig II 11 i | ; Supplementary Rule 17) when travelling on duty in the United Kingdom, it might result in certain anomalies, for example, a Major, Indian Army (married) whose pay is Rs.1305 a month will 'be required to travel third class on duty by virtue of his rank, whereas a civil officer of equivalent, and in some case of lower official status, would be entitled to travel first class by virtue of the pay drawn by him. Copy of a letter No .F .7087/33, dated the 9th January 1934, from the India Office to the Government of India, Finance Department. Subject:- Proposal to alter the classification of officers for the purpose of railway travel in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. • In reply to your letter of the 9th November 1933, No .F .5 (28)-R.I ./33, on the above subject, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council to inform you that he notes that the Government of India agree to restricting the privilege of Ist Class travel in the case of civil officers, to those in receipt of pay of £1000 inclusive per annum and over, when travelling on duty in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The restriction does not apply to travel in the Irish jree .otate. It is presumed that 'pay of £ 1000 per annum' refers to the sterling equivalent of the pay and officer would draw while he is on duty in India and not the pay he would draw on duty in this country. It is also presumed that overseas pay should be excluded from the calculation since it would appear to be unjustifiable to discriminate in this matter between officers of non-Asiatic domicile and those of Asiatic domicile who are in receipt of the same rate of basic pay. It may also be desirx- able to express the limit in rupees instead of in sterling. I am to add that the Secretery fif SxtE of State in Council agrees that military officers in civil eivloy should be governed by civil rules.AKCJ: i^AKXikL&amp;IT, ueceiYed with Busaire IsUer l:o&gt; 542/67 /18 dated 5rd t. arch 1954. v ^ •: ^ j /?0 Notification . .jriM Simla the 15th April 1932^ ho. ¥» 12-VI-R. 11/32. - In exercise of the powera conferred by rules 37 and 44 (d) of the Civil Serrices (Claaification, Control and Appeal) miles, the Governor General in Council is pleased to uiake 'tae following ruie®- H u 1 e .

I/ 52 » ^ated the Ifath April, 1932, w .ich was baaed on a taisinterpretation of article w&gt;o7 # Civil Service hsgulations. This Article was wrongly interpreted as meaning that the classification of military service which had been allowed to count for tiie purpose of a civil pension under the provisions of Article •^6 ifrid. was to be deterrained by the charact^^gl the subsequent ./ civil service; in other words, tiu.t tu« prev;ous^srfrvice should be classiXied as superior of*' inferior according as t.ie subsequent civil service was superior or inferior. It has now been held, in consultation with the Auditor eneral, t^at except to the limited extent indicated in the opening sentence of Article 357,Civil ervice isgulations, tiie classification of tixe military service depends, not on the character of the subsequent civil employment but on the cuarater of the military appointment in which it was rendered. Military service rendered prior to civil employment aas tuus to be classified as inferior or superior according aa to wxadc/ wxietaer it would have been inferior or superior had it been rendered in a similar ap ointment pensionable under civile rules. tith regard to tne ©Aception in tiie opening sentence of Article 36^, uivix ^eivice iegulati^ns referred to sbove,w ich provides urtrW^the treata«nt of servxas as a private or in any higher combatant rank as superior if followed by superior civil service, I am to explain that it docj not mean that suu service suall be treated as superior oruy if followed by superior civil service and that oth.rwise it shall be treated as inferior, correctly interpreted, it means that suc.^ uillt&amp;ry service,whether - ^otherwise it would be trea ted as superior or inf crior, b aall be treated as superior civii^service, ana tiiat if it is foliwed by iiiijiior civil service, ito cXaMi.fication wii be governed by the ordinary principle for de termini rig such classif icatiorjlaid uown in Article 357-Civil Service itegulations whicn have been explained above. 2. The correct proceedure when dealing with cases relatin to the counting of ilitary serivce for civil pension, is as follows. The extent to which sertice whic.x is pensionable unuer the military rules may be allowed to cuunt as part of subsequent civil service qualifying for pension under tne civil rules suould be detemined in accordance with the provisions of Article 366, Civil oexvice ivegulations read with the rule in tao xi :!l nce department ] otification f o. y. 11-1-H. 11/34, dated the 4th January 1934, and the classification of such military service gixould be dotermintid by the principles laid down in Article 367, Civil Service uegulations which are explained in paragraph 1 above. If the clas*&gt; of the service pensionable under tne »nilitary rules as thus de term i ned under Article 367 is different frau tiie class of * the subsequent civil service, as detsrmined unuer Article 59C, Civil Service i egulationo, ti.en Article 3iti, civil* Service hwguiations should be ap.lied for calculation of toe amount of pension.

Subject:- Recovery of passage contribution in respect of Government servants entitled to passage concessions who form additions to regular establishments under Fundamental Rule 127. Sir ' I am directed to say that it has., been brought to the notice of the Government of India that there is at present no provision anywhere for the recovery of a contribution for passages in respect of Government servants entitled to passage concessions vto form additions to regular establishments under Fundamental Rule 127. As the cost of additional establishments together with contributions for leave and pension, is recoverable from the parties for whose benefit they pre created, a contribution for passages also should be levied where necessary in respect of such establishments at the same rates as are applicable to Government servants entitled to passage concessions who are transferred to foreign service, viz., Rs. 50/- per mensem in the case of superior officers and-Rs. 30/- per mensem in the case of non -superior officers. 2. The question has also been raised in this connection whether the contribution for passages, if recoverable in the case of a Government servant falling under Fundamental Rule 127, should be charged during the whole period of his service in the a dditional post, including any leave taken by him from that post. The decision arrived at is that it should be levied during the whole period of service in the additional post except that it should not be charged dur i ng le ave whe r e : - (a) the leave taken is leave preparatory to retirement; or (b) the Government servant concerned will, on return from leave, be given different duties and not return to the additional post, or (c)-2~ (c) the substitute in the additional post, for the Government servant on leave, is entitled to pas^a^.e concessions and a contribution for passages is ' recovered on his behalf.

Massey as the lower scale, to which he substantively belongs, contains a leave reserve for the whole establishment# In the circumstances, it appears that Mr. Bhalla may be granted a leave salary of Rs.66/- p.m., Rs*4/- being treated as the 'amount required to arrange for his work' under correction slip No.5C 506 to Supplementary Rules 285 of the Post and Telegraph compilation of the Fundemental and Supplementary Rules. As, however, the amount required to arrange for Mr. Bhalla # s work is strictly not Rs»4/- but Rs.76/- i.e. the whole pay drawn by Mr. Massey, while officiating, I request you kindly to let me know whether intention of the Clause recerred to above is as interpreted by me» * i Copy of letter No.C.435-St/33, dated the 10th January 1934, from the Commissioner, Northern India Salt Revenue, Delhi, to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, New Delhi# *— it Of Subject:- Reports and Returns - Absentee statement December 1933. I have the honour to say that B. Sham Lai Bhalla, Upper Scale Clerk, appointed in an officiating capacity in accordance with the Finance Department's resolution No.D/4523-Ex.1/31, dated the 9th July 1931, against a substative vacancy in the Superintendents Office, Pachbadra, was granted 23 days' leave on average pay from the 20th November 1933 to the 12th December 1933. During this period he was granted leave salary at.Rs.70/- p.m. which is equal to his fall average pay. Since Mr. B.N.Massey a lov/er scale clerk was appointed to act in the upper scale in this vacancy and was grated acting allowance at.Rs.4/- p.m. I request you kindly to let me know whether the leave salary at Rs.70/- p.m. was correctly granted to the clerk» Copy of letter from the Auditor GBHeral in India to the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department, No.80- A/41-34, dated the 27th April 1934. Subject:- Application of the condition of 'no expense to Government' laid down in Supplementary Rule 285 in cases where the leave reserve for several grades of the same establishment is provided for in the lowest grade, and officiating arrangements in leave vacancies in the higher grandes by the appointment of persons from the lower grade entail extra expense. With reference to your letter NO .A -2274 /RI/S /9, dated the 13th February 1934, on the subject indicated above, I have the honour to state, with the concurrence of the Government of India, as follows. 2. In the particular case referred to by you, not - withstanding the existence of a clear vacancy in the upper &gt;upper graci© of clsrlcsj I.5r« S«I j * BVialla. iiao t»o d © appointed in an officiating capacity, only because of the general embargo on confirmation of persons not in service of Government on the 15th July 1931 laid down in Government of India, Finance Department Resolution No.D/4523-Sx.1/31 dated the 9th July 1931 e The condition of 'no Expense to Government' in Supplementary Rule 285 will not therefore apply to Mr. Bhalla* s case, vide the orders contained in Government of India, Finance Department Resolution N 'o .F .12(70 )R.I ./32 dated the 30th November 1932. Although the latter Resolution refers only to 'establishments having no leave reserve', it is not the intention of the Government of India to exclude from its operation cases like the one referred to by you, in which there is extra expense, even when there is a leave reserve. 3. The necessity for a decision on the point raised by you may arise in cases similar to that of I.Ir• Bhalla but not falling within the scope of the Finance Department Resolution of the 30th November 1932 cited above . In such cases, the net extra cost involved in arranging for the work of the absentee should be taken in place of the 'pay of the substitute' mentioned at the end of the proviso to Supplementary ^ule 285, as ikK inserted by correction slip No.255, dated the 14th November 1933. ,No. 111? of 19 (?4&gt; British Kesidency ^/S&amp;suiate -General, Bushire, the . 19 . . ijjj-Augt 54. ht Res.

Note .—In the case of a chaplain, the accept ance during leave of a benefice in the United Kingdom is not acceptance of foreign service for the purpose of clause (&amp;) above. ^—(^) A Local Government shall suspend the lien of a Government servant on a perma nent post which he holds substantively if he is appointed in a substantive capacity— (1) to a tenure post, or (2) to a permanent post outside the cadre on which he is borne, or (3) provisionally, to a post on which another Government servant would hold a lien had his lien not been suspended under this rule.

S ubject :— Redraft of the rides relating to lien. S ir, We have the honour to forward for your consideration and orders draft amendments to the F undamental Rules calculated primarily to define precisely the position of a Government servant in relation to the cadre to which he belongs, when he is appointed substantively to a post outside the cadre. 2. We have long been impressed with the inadequacy of the existing rules to cope with the complex questions of lien that arise from time to time. To illustrate this point, we need only instance the case of Mr. Gr. Findlay Shirras, which formed the subject of correspondence ending with the letter from the India Office, No. S. &amp; G. 2733-25, dated the 9th July 1925. The Auditor General has held, and we agree with him, that the recognition of lien on more than one post at the same time is not permissible under the Fundamental Rules as they stand at pi esent, and has suggested that the title of Government servants who are appointed substantively to tenure posts should also be clearlv defined in the rules. 3. We have had the relevant rules in the existing Fundamental Rules carefully examined m consultation with the Auditor General and as a result after prolonged discussion, we have had prepared the enclosed draft amendments which we believe go far towards meeting all valid criticisms of the existing i ules. 4. e append to this despatch a memorandum explanatory of the proposed amendments. We propose that these amendments, if approved by vou in Council, should not be published immediately but should be embodied 'in the general redraft of the Fundamental Rules applying exclusivelv to the Services which will continue under your control under the Civil Services (Classification Contiol and Appea ) Rules. We intend to make parallel provisions in the rules i.F I d aPP 7 SerV1CeS Under 0lir COntro1 ' bllt anticipate that conditionsin the latter Services may involve some elaboration uncalled for in the rules for the former Services, which we now submit for your approval.

Draft amendments to the Lien Rules in the Fundamental Rules. Rule 9. Substitute the following for clause (13) of this rule :— 9 (13). Lien means the title of a Government servant to hold substantively, either immediately or on the termination of a period or periods of absence, a permanent post, including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed sub stantively. Rules 13—15. Substitute the following for these rules :— 12-A. Unless in any case it be otherwise distinctly provided in these rules, a Government servant on substantive appointment to any permanent post acquires a lien on that post and ceases to hold any lien previously acquired on any other post. 13. Unless his lien is suspended under rule 14 or transferred under rule 14-B, a Government servant holding substantively a permanent post retains a lien on that post or on a post of the same character in the same cadre— (a) while performing the duties of that post ; (b) while on foreign service, or holding a temporary post, or officiating in another post ; (c) during joining time on transfer to another post ; unless he is trans ferred substantively to a post on lower pay, in which case his lien is transferred to the new post from the date on which he is relieved of his duties in the old post ; (d) while on leave ; and (e) while under suspension. Note. In the case of a chaplain, the acceptance during leave of a benefice in the United Kingdom is not acceptance of foreign service for the purpose of clause (6) above. 14. (a) A Local Government shall suspend the lien of a Government ser vant on a permanent post which he holds substantivelv, if he is appointed in a substantive capacity— (1) to a tenure post, or (2) to a permanent post outside the cadre on which he is borne, or (3) provisionally, to a post on which another Government servant would hold a lien had his lien not been suspended under this rule. (/;) A Local Government may, at its* option, suspend the lien of a Govern ment servant on a permanent post which he holds substantivelv if in circum- stances not covered by clause (a) of this rule, he is transferred whether in a substantive or officiating capacity, to duty unconnected with that post and there is reason to believe that he will remain absent from it for a period not less than three years. Note 1. A Government servant's lien on a post may not be suspended under this clause necause he .s appointed to hold substantively or to officiate in another post in the same cadre. k i. ^ Note 2.— Foreign service should be regarded as duty for the purpose of this elauae. (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (a) or (b) of this rule 'w ♦rr P08t ma y in circumstances he 'us- , ' w is appomted suhstantively to another permanent post, his lien on the tenure post must be definitely terminated. nr (hV ^.

N ote ].—This clause applies if the post concerned is a post in a selection grade of a cadre. N ote 2. —When a post is filled substantively under this clause, the appointment will be termed a provisional appointment ; the Government servant appointed will hold a pro visional lien on the post ; and that lien will be liable to suspension under clause (a) or (&amp;) of this rule. (e) A Government servant's lien which has been suspended under clause (a) of this rule shall revive as soon as he ceases to hold a lien on a post of the nature specified in sub-clause (1), (2) or (3) of that clause. (/) A Government servant's lien which has been suspended under clause (b) of this rule shall revive as soon as he ceases to perform the duty to which he was transferred or other duty unconnected with the post to which the lien relates ; provided that a suspended lien shall not revive because the Government servant takes leave if there is reason to believe that he will return from leave to the duty to which he was transferred or to other duty of such nature that appointment or transfer to it would justify the suspension of his lien under clause (a) or clause (b) of this rule and, incases where suspension under clause (fi) would be justified, that the total period of absence on duty will not fall short of three years. 14-A. (a) A Government servant's lien on a post may in no circumstances be definitely terminated, even with his consent, if the result will be to leave him without a lien or a suspended lien upon some permanent post. (b) In a case covered by sub-clause (2) of clause (a) of rule 14, the sus pended lien may not, except on the written request of the Government servant concerned, be definitely terminated while the Government servant remains in Government service. 14-J5. Subject to the provisions of rule 15, a Local Government may transfer to anorhei peiinanent post in the same cadre the lien of a Government servant who is not performing the duties of the post to which the lien relates even if that lien has been suspended. 15. (a) A Local Government may transfer a Government servant from one post to another ; provided that, except— (1) on account of inefficiency or misbehaviour, or (2) on his written request, a Government servant shall not be transferred substantively to, or except in a case covered by rule 49, appointed to officiate in, a post carrymg less pay than the pay ot the permanent post on which he holds a lien, or, if there be no such Snder 0 riile e i4 0St ^ WhlCh he W0Uld h0ld a liel&gt; had his Uen n0t been sus P en ded (ft) Nothing conlained in clause (a) of this rnle or in clause (13) of rule 9 shail operate to pm-ent the retransfer of a Government sen-ant to the post on whcih he would hold a hen had it not been suspended in accordance with the pro visions of clause (a) of rule 14. p R ule 26.

Memorandum explanatory of the proposed amendments to the Lien Rules in thr Fundamental Rules. G eneral remarks. .hortTy Wrribed IrUows!' ^ amendraonts are desi ^ ed ^e may be 22. Firstly, the rules may be discussed, in their relation to individual Gov ernment servants. The intention is to secure that ordinarily there shall be, for eacli Government servant, one, and one only, ultimate lien on a permanent post. This ultimate lien may be an active lien if the Government servant is perform ing the duties of the post in question or those of another post on which he can not hold a lien. It will be a suspended lien when he is performing the duties of another post on which he holds a lien if, in the ordinary course of events, the latter lien may conceivably terminate, otherwise than by substantive appoint ment to another post, before his service ends. 3. The only case in which it is proposed to allow one and the same Govern ment servant to hold two liens which are of the nature of ultimate liens is the case in which an officer is transferred from one service to another and does not desire entirely to sever his connection with the former service. In that case, he retains a suspended lien on a post in his old service, which he can resume in certain circumstances ; while he has something very like an ultimate lien on some post in the service to which he has been transferred. As a matter of fact, both these are not leally ultimate liens. Which of them will eventually prove to be ' ultimate ' will be known when he finally decides to return, or not to return, to his parent service. 4. At first sight, it would appear highly desirable to assert a corresponding principle also, and to legislate in such a way that every Government servant shall bold one, and only one, active lien on a permanent or cadre post. It is possible to ensure that no Government servant will hold more than one active lien, and it is claimed that this has been done in the re-draft. In the nature of things, however, there must be an exception to the rule that each Government servant must have an active lien of some kind. When an officer is transferred to duty, likely to last for three years, in a post on which a lien may not be held, such as foreign service or duty in a temporary post, it is essential to fill his place in his own cadre, which will othenvise be short of personnel for an un reasonably long period. He cannot therefore be permitted to retain an active lien on a post in the cadre, and consequently has no active lien at all. With this one exception, it is claimed that the principle of ' one and onlv one active lien ' is established by the re-draft. 5. The second point of view from which the re-draft may be regarded is in relation to posts and to the cadres, if any, on which they are borne. The re draft is designed to ensure that, so far as circumstances permit, for each per manent post and each post included in a cadre, there shall be one, and one only, active lien and one, and one only, ultimate lien. There may, at times, be two suspended liens on one post ; but one of these must always be provisional ' and will therefore not be an 4 4 ultimate ^ lien. It is believed that the re-draft enforces this principle in its entirety ; with the one exception that the existing right of Government, conferred by fundamental rule 9 (19), of refraining from making a substantive appointment in a vacant post, is conserved. As no Gov ernment servant may hold two active liens at the same time, the acquisition of a lien on a tenure post makes essential the cessation of the holder's lien upon a permanent post in the cadre ; and it is for this reason that provision has been made for the compulsory cessation of the latter lien. Suspension of lien is chosen m preference to its definite termination, in order to avoid the risk that the completion of tenure of a tenure post might leave the former holder without a hen on any post in the cadre. D etailed comments on the dbaft rules. G Rvle 9 ( 7.3 )—The defiintion of 'lien ' has been reworded. It seems desirable so to word the definition as to make it quite plain that a Government servant holds a hen on his substantive post while he is actually performinc its duties. I his conception of hen makes it very much easier to'brine the cadre with eaTofW A „ tw 0 - ' into intelligible relations wWV, f All that is really required is a word expressing the bond 8 P a . TU ™ l!i l man r th a P arti c'Iw Post in a substantive capa- newCd foXp^ose' ^ 7 ' eXi8ting term ' lien ' than to coin a 7. flwJe This is a new rule, which is inserted in order to state olearlv he circumstances m which a hen is ordinarily acquired and terminated.8. Rule 13. —This reproduces Rule 14 with the following modifications. It has been made clear that suspension and transfer of lien are permissible in those cases only where they are effected in accordance with the substantive rules on the subject. Clause (a) of this rule states a fact which has hitherto been merely implied. Clause id) has been amended in consequence of the amendment of clause (2) of rule 97. 9. Rule 14 — General remarks. —This rule provides for the suspension of lien. Two clauses (a) and {h) dealing respectively with compulsory and with optional suspension have been inserted. In view of the insertion of these two clauses, it seems desirable to insert a third clause (d) explaining the effect of a suspension generally and two other clauses (e) and(/) describing the circum stances in which suspension comes to an end. The sixth clause (c) seems neces- sary to express as a substantive rule what in fact is an exception to two of the other clauses and therefore unsuitable for inclusion in a note under either of them. 10. Rule 14, clause (a). —This is intended to dis'pose of the main kinds of cases in which the existing rules permit a G-overnment servant to retain an active lien on two permanent posts at one time. There seems to be no objection to compulsory suspension of lien when a new lien is acquired. 11. Rule 14, clause (b). —This clause repeats the first part of existing rule 13 with slight changes in wording. The notes under the clause are intended to make quite plain facts which are implicit in the present rule but have not been universally understood. 12. Rule 14, clause (c). —This clause is designed to prevent a multiplication of suspended liens which would bo undesirable and administratively incon venient. There can be no hardship in requiring a Government servant, as a condition of securing substantive appointment elsewhere, to give up his ulti mate claim on a tenure post. ithout this provision, the officer concerned would have two suspended liens. Under the proposed amendments to the rules, the only case in which this will be possible will be that of an officer transferred to another service or to an isolated post outside any service, who retains a sus pended lien on a post in the parent service, and is subsequently appointed to a tenure post other than a tenure post in the parent service, or transferred to another new service. 13. Rule 14, clause (d). — 1 his clause follows Rule 13 with slight changes in wording. In place of the reference to ' the return ' of the Government servant concerned, it has been provided that the arrangement shall be reversed on the revival of the suspended lien. It was always possible that the Government servant might not literally ' return ' since he might be transferred to an entirely different post on the cadre when his special duty ended. . ^ 0 A e 1 ' n ^ er clause has been taken from the last sentence of Rule 13. It is t;ejieyed that this explanation is necessary, since the post of (sav) Superin- tendent of Police is nothing more than a post of Superintendent of Police even though a particular holder of it draws pay on a selection scale. In other words the holding of the particular post gives no claim to selection scale pay. Note 2 under the clause is new. It seems desirable to provide formally for the term provisional appointment ' which has actually been in use for years. Ihe uecessUy tor a provisional lien ' and its suspension mav be judged from the lollowmg example ;— ' &amp; A, a substantive Collector, is appointed substantively to the tenure post of Secretory to Goveinment. His lien as a Collector is compulsorily suspended, and B is appointed provisionally to be substantive Collector in his place If B in lus 'irn becomes a Secretary, there will again be a provisional vacancy as Collector, which C B's .iiimor, will fill. TJ„l CS s B is allowed to retain a sus pcnded provisional hen, O'g claim to confirmation as Collector in A's vacancv will be superior to that of his senior B. acancy 14. Rule 14, clauses (e) and (/).—These are new provisions, settine: forth the cimimstances m which lions revive. It seems desirable to stkte thefe cafe goncally. They are intended to make quite plain a fact which is implici t in the present rule but has not been universally understood. It is considerp^ #1. , j • view of the fact that all leave taken by members of , service s tokln if account m fixing the strength of the leave reserve of that service it iOmprooe? to allow a suspension of hen to continue during leave taken after a period ofspecial duty, prior either to retirement or to return to the ordinary line. On the other hand, it is convenient and unobjectionable to allow suspension to continue during leave taken in the course of special duty even though the special duly may not remain identical throughout. 15. Rule 14-A. —Clause (a) of this rule is new. It seems very desirable to enunciate quite plainly the principle that every Government servant must always have an ultimate lien upon some permanent post. Clause (fc) is also new. The word ' written ' has been inserted as a measure of protection of the interests of the Government servant concerned. 16. Rule 14-B. —This is a new rule. It is desirable to set forth categori cally the fact that a lien or a suspended lien may be transferred when a Govern ment servant Is absent from the post which he holds substantively. This has hitherto not been specifically stated, though it might be inferred from rule 15. 17. Rule 15, clause (a).—This clause states in plain words a power which is implied by the present rule. This clause has been amplified to allow a Govern ment servant at his own choice to accept transfer to a post on lower pay than that on which he holds a lien. Actual cases have necessitated this addition. A new provision has been included in this clause to give effect to the sugges tion made in this Department letter No. F.-420-B.l.|27, dated the 5th March 1928, thai a Government servant shall not be appointed to officiate in a post lower in status than his substantive post. The reference to ' the cadre of the service to which he belongs ' has been omitted. There may be more than one service. The case may be instanced of a member of the Indian Civil Service transferred to the Income-Tax Department, who retains a suspended lien on a post in his I. C. S. cadre. As long as he remains in the Income-Tax Department, he must be protected against transfer to a post on lower pay than that of his substantive post in that Department. On the other hand, if he reverts to the I. C. S., the comparison to be made will be with the pay of the I. C. S. post on which he holds a suspended lien. In no case can the comparison be made with the pay of both posts at one and the same time. It is believed that the wording of the amendment expresses the real intention. At the same time, it must be emphasised that the amendment does not attempt to provide for the conditions on which a Government servant may be transferred from one service to another and subsequently reverted to his original service. It is the business of the Fundamental Rules merely to safeguard the officer's lien on a post in his original service and to protect him from transfer to a lower post in the service in which he is at the moment placed than that on which he holds a lien. In this clause also the word written has been inserted as a measure of protection of the Government servant concerned. Rule Jo, clause (h). This clause has been inserted to place beyond question the power of Government to order reversions in all cases of transfer falling under clause {a) of draft rule 14. The real object of Fundamental Rule 15 is to affoid a Government seixani protection in regard to his service or cadre pay Under the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, even those posts which are now isolated will be brought into the cadre of some service or other. In connection with tenure posts the Government of India have recently taken the view that a Government servant can be reverted from a tenure post only in accordance with the terms prescribing the tenure. It will be seen from the definition of tenure post contained in Fundamental Rule 9 (30A) that it is intended that the period of tenure should be prescribed by way of a limit and not by way of a definite period. It is clear that, if tenures are prescribed in this way. Government will always have the power to revert a Government servant rom a tenure post before he completes the normal tenure. It therefore follows that if the present opportunity is taken to state expressly that Government reserves to itself the power to revert a Government servant from a tenure post beiore the completion oi the tenure, it will not in essence be a departure from existing principles. Transfers irader sub-clause (3) of clause of draft rule 14 are expressed as provisional. Tins being the case, the point may be raised whether it is reallv necessary to reserve to Government, through clause (b) oi rule 15, the ri}?ht to make reversions in cases falling under that sub-clause. This reservation is proposed because that sub-clause read with clause (d) suggests that a provisional appointment k&gt; a post can be reversed by Government only if and when the Government servant who holds a suspended lien on that post is reverted thereto. 6It, however, seems necessary that Government should have the power to reverse a provisional appointment in circumstances other than those just described. It will be observed that the Government of India have not proposed to reserve to themselves the right to make reversions in cases falling under clause {h) of draft rule 14. The only class of cases falling under rule 14 (b) in which a Government servant may acquire a fresh lien are those in which he is transferred substantively to a permanent post other than a tenure post in his own cadre. The case of an Executive Engineer of the Indian Service of Engineers appointed substantively to a permanent post of Superintending Engineer in his own cadre or of an officer of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service in class 1 of the General List appointed substantively to a permanent post of Accountant General are instances in point. Note I to rule % 14 {h) pre vents the suspension of lien on the Government servant's former post in such cases. Under rule r2-A, the Government servant will acquire^ a fresh lien on the new post and forfeit the lien on his old post, so that the question of retransfer of the Government servant ' to the post on which he would hold a lien had it not been suspended ' will not arise. 18. Rule 26. —This is a consequential amendment. 19. Rule 97, —These draft rules provide for the continuance of a suspended lien during the tenure by an officer of any of the high offices mentioned in this rule and also for such lien during leave taken after completion of such tenure. The provision in clause (2) of the existing rule that an officer who vacates any of the high posts after having held them substantively and takes leave imme diately may be left without a lien on any permanent post was necessary obvious ly for the reason that under the rules as they stand, it is difficult to find a post on which the officer can be given a lien during the period of leave since on his substantive appointment to the high post he ceases to have any connection with any of the permanent posts previously held substantively. Now that in these rules provision is made to the effect that an officer on substantive appointment to any of the high offices mentioned in this rule will retain a suspended lien during the period of leave he may take after vacating such office, the provision in clause (2) of the existing rule that he may be left without a lien on any permanent post seems to be unnecessary and is, therefore, proposed to be deleted. The intention, however, is to issue, with reference to paragraph 2 of the Secretary of State's despatch No. 43-Services, dated the 19th December 1929, an executive order that such an officer may not return to a cadre post on completion of his tenure notwithstanding the existence of a lien on such a post. ♦ L41FinD-4605—16-10-31—GIPSDemi-official letter prom the India Office, No. F. 7533|31, dated the 31st December 1931. Will you kindly refer to the despatch from the Government of India in the Finance Department, No. 6, dated 22nd October, 1931. 2. Before 1 submit these proposals to higher authority here, I should be grateful it you would let mo have your observations on the following points :— (1) Draft Rule l.H. —Having regard to the proposed definition of lien, it seems doubtful whether the words 44 or on a post of the same character in the same cadre ' can properly be retained without some amendment of the rule : an officer cannot, it would seem, retain a lien on a post if he has never acquired it by being appointed to that post. Could the words in question be merely omitted without any other change f (2) Draft Bide 14 (h). —In order to get rid of the two Notes (which are not merely explanatory but contain substantive provisions) I would suggest the re drafting of 4he clause as follows :— ' A Local Government may, at its option, suspend the lien of a Govern ment servant if he is transferred to foreign service, or in circum stances not covered by clause (a) of this Rule, whether in a substan tive or officiating capacity, to a post in another cadre, the duty of which is unconnected with the post on which he holds a lien, and it in any of these cases there is reason to believe that he will remain absent from that post for a period not less than three years.' (3) Draft Rule 15. —This Knle, as is mentioned in the Explanatory Memo randum, is intended to i&gt;'ive effect to the suggestion made in Burdon's letter No. F. 420-R.T.I27, dated 5th March, 1928, bnt the Rule still leaves it open to a Local Government to appoint an officer, at his request, to officiate in a post carrying less pay than the pay of the post on which he holds a lien, and since an officor so appointed might, under the terms (if not the intention) of Rnle 31, draw the presumptive pay of the latter post, the objections raised in the Auditor- General's notes of the 7th January, 1928, enclosed with Burdon's letter re ferred to above, do not seem to be met. What seems to be required is a provision that where an officer is, at his own request, so transferred, he should not enjoy the benefits of the proviso to Rnle 31. Perhaps the insertion of the following after the words 44 provided that ' in Rnle 31 would meet the Case :— T : f*) ( &lt;k except in the case of a Government servant whose transfer to the post in which he is officiating was made at his own request under Rule 15.') (4) Draft amendment to Ride. 26. —We assume that the intention of Rule 26 ih) is that the officiating service described therein should count for increments in the time scale applicable to the post which the officer is actually holding substantively, that is to say, to a post of the kind described in draft rule 14 {a), (1), (2) or (3). If this is so, it would seem that 44 Rule 14 (/;) ' should be substituted for ' Rule 13 ' in this Rule. Similar considerations seem to apply to Rules 22, 26 (6), 30 (*), 30 (2) and 31—which m any case will require amendment in view of the changed num- , bering of the rules. (.)) Draft amendment to Ride 97 (3). —The first portion of this clause, which it is proposed should remain intact, would seom, after the draft amend ments have been made, merely to state a fact which follows from them, bnt under draft Rule 14 ( p ), the officer's lien on his cadre post would revive as soon as he vacated one ot the high offi'ces in question, and it would not be in the competence of am authority to issue an executive order, as suggested in 19 of the Fxplana- tor&gt; Memorandum, conflicting with this provision. These proposed amendments of the rules therefore seem to make it necessary, despite what was said in paragraph 2 of the Secretary of State's Services Despatch No. 43, dated 19th December, 1929, to make specific provision in the rules on the point in question. T would suggest the substitution for Rule 97 (2) of the following 44 Tf a Government servant takes leave immediately on vacating any of the offices referred to in sub-rule (1). or the post of Chief Com missioner, Consulting Engineer to the Government of India, orChief Engineer of the Public Works or Railway Department or posts held by officers in the Superior Revenue Establishment of State Railways corresponding in rank to a Chief Engineer, his lien suspended under Rule 14 (a) shall not revive, and he shall be left during the leave without a lien on any post.' This would involve the prefixing to di'aft Rule 14 (e) of the words :— ' Except as provided in Rule 97 (G) Since it appears to be contemplated in draft Rule 14 (fo) that an officer, without proceeding on foreign service, may have his lien on his permanent post suspended without acquiring a lien on any other post, it would seem that after the word ' lien ' in Rule 59, the words :—' or a suspended lien ' should be inserted. The same point seems to apply to Rule 111 (h). 3. We should be glad to know when the general re-draft of the Funda mental Rules referred to in paragraph 4 of the despatch may be expected. If there is likely to be considerable delay, it might perhaps be advisable to make these amendments forthwith. See in this connection paragraph 4 of the letter from this office No. F. 4916[30, dated 21st August, 1930 (vour Reference F. 2| XVT|RTI|30.) ' f D emi-official, letter to the I ndia O ffice, N o . F. 10 (8)-R.I. j 34, dated the 5 th A pbil 1934. Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. F. 7533131, dated the 31st December 1931 ? The long delay in sending a reply is regretted but the questions at issue are complex and have necessitated detailed consideration in several departments. Our views on the various points are stated below. 2. (1) Draft Ride 13. —We agree with your suggestion that the words ' or on a post of the same character in the same cadre ' may be omitted from the rule, particularly in view of the provision in draft rule 14-B. for the transfer of the lien, active or suspended, of a Government servant from one permanent post to another in the same cadre. No other change will be necessary. (2) Draft Evlr 14 (h). —We agree that 4ho notes below this rule should be incorporated in the rule itself. The rule as drafted by us, however, was in tended to apply, inter alia, to cases of transfer on deputation out of India which technically is not transfer 11 to a post in another cadre '. Mainly for this reason we should prefer the following redraft :— ' A Local Government may, at its option, suspend the lien of a Govern ment servant on a permanent post which he holds substantively if he is deputed out of India or transferred to foreign service, or, in circumstances not covered by clause (a) of this rule, is transferred whether in a substantive or officiating capacity, to a post in another cadre, and if in any of these cases there i- reason to believe that he wall remain absent from the post on which he holds a lien for a period of not less than three years If the rule is redrafted on these lines it will be necessary to recast clause (f) of this rule as follows :— • ' A Government servant's lien which has been suspended under clause (h) of this rule, shall revive as soon as he ceases to be on deputation out of India or on foreign service or to held a post in another cadre, provided that a suspended lien shall not revive because the Gov ernment servant takes leave if there is reason to believe that he will, on return from leave, continue to be on deputation out of India or on foreign service or to hold a post in another cadre and the total period of absence on duty will not fall shoH of three years or that he will hold substantively a post of the nature speci fied in sub-clause (1), (2) or (3) of clause (a) '. (3) Draft Ttvle 15. —We agree to the addition to Fundamental Rule 31 which you propose with the substitution of u appointment ' for ' tranRfr'r ' to conform to the phraseology used in draft rule 15. We would also Piiggest that the words u if there be no such post, of the post on which ho ' appearing in lines 7 and 8 of the draft rule are redundant. In this connection I would point out that under draft rule 15 a Oovemmeut sorvant may at his own request be transferred either substantively or in anofficiating capacity to a post carrying less pay than the pay of the permanent post on which he holds a lien or would hold a lien had his lien not been sus pended. In the case of a substantive transfer the pay on transfer will have to be regulated under Fundamental Rule 22 ; if the transfer be in an officiating capacity, the pay will be regulated under Fundamental Rule 31. In Funda- mental Rule 22 there is no provision for the regulation of the pay of a Govern ment servant who is appointed to a post the maximum pay of which is less than his substantive pay in respect of a permanent post. As Fundamental Rule 31 is now being amended so as to provide specifically that a Government servant who at his own request is appointed under Fundamental Rule 15 to officiate in a lower post will draw only the presumptive pay of that post, it is desirable that specific provision should be made in Fundamental Rule 22 for the regulation of the pay of a Government servant appointed substantively to a post the maximum pay of which is less than his substantive pay in the post on which he holds a lien or would hold a lien had it not been suspended. We consider that in such a case the maximum of the pay of the lower post should be fixed as initial pay. In order to give effect to these views, the following may be added as a new sub clause under clause (a) of Fundamental Rule 22 :— ' (Hi) When appointment to the new post is made on his own request under rule 15 (a) and the maximum pay in the time-scale of that post is less than his substantive pay in respect of the old post, he will draw that maximum as initial pay'. (4) Fundamental Ride 2G. —Clause (6) of Fundamental Rule 26 regulates the counting of service for increments only in the officer's original post, i.e., the post mentioned in the second line of draft rule 14 (a), and when it was drafted cases of the kind described in sub-clauses (1), (2) and (3) of draft rule 14 (a) were not taken into account. The intention is that when a Government servant is transferred from his original post to a second post in a substantive capacity in the manner contemplated in draft rule 14 (a), (1), (2) and (3), and is subse quently appointed in an officiating capacity to a third post, the period of his officiating service should count for increments not only in the time-scale of the original post the lien on which is suspended under draft rule 14 (a), bnta]- » in the time-scale of the post to which he is appointed in a substantive capacity as contemplated in that rule. It is also the intention that service of the kinds men tioned in draft rule 14 (a), (1), (2) and (3), should count for increments in the original post, the lien on which is suspended. Effect could suitably be given to our intentions in this matter by recasting Fundamental Rule 26 (b) as follows :— ' Service in another post, whether in a substantive or officiating capacity, service on deputation and leave other than extraordinary leave count for increments in the time-scale applicable to the pt-^t on which the Government servant holds a lien, as well as the p*»st or posts, if any, on which he would hold a lien had his lien not been suspended '. A reference to rule 14 at the end of this redraft is hardly necessary. Tiie references in Fundamental Rules 22, 26 (p), 30 (1), 30 (2 and 31. if retail ^: m all, should be to rule 14, but all these references might well W oanmed. lu clause (6) of Fundamental Rule 26 is amended as proposed above, dans* (e) (*) of the rule should read— *' the post in Government service on which the Governmenl vaioiia cv cerned holds a lien as well as the p^t or postSs if amy, « a v9n :ifli he would hold a lien had his lien not been smsj riBvUNi \ (5) Fmnldnu ntiil it ,(!&lt; u' 1 ^ e a give that as a result of Ifee prapondl amendments, the suspended lien of a Govomnient s&lt; vv : .v.: ;n ; &gt; ^ to y.s- would under draft rule 14(c) revive immediate^ on iv.s x.w.-: „ t - high offices mentioned in rule 97 and that any resmrtior s m '3his , i. • . be imposed by specific provision in iho rule ilsolf and not fey ^ orders.

It has been accepted by the Secretary of State in paragraph 2 of I ilh Services Despatch Ko. -43, dated the 19th December 1929, that such further employment under the Crown would be contrary to the public interest in the case of a Government servant who has been a Member of an Indian Government. This presumably only refers to those who have been substantive Members of a Government. In the case of a substantive Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department similar considera tions would apply as in that Department the post of Chief Engineer is the highest which a Government servant can hold. The case, however, of Chief Commis sioners and Railway officers is different. The Chief Commissioners referred to in the rule are those in charge of minor administrations like Delhi or Coorg or those in charge of centrally administered areas in addition to their duties as Political Eesidents. Such an officer may have many years of service before him and it might be desirable to retain his services in other posts after the expiry of the tenure of his appointment as Chief Commissioner. A Chief Engineer or officer of corresponding rank on a Railway is not altogether in the same position as a Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department ; while the latter is the principal officer of his Department in a Province the former is not, taking the Railway administration as a whole, and he may in due course be appointed as Agent or as a Member of the Railway Board. In the cases of the Chief Commissioners and Railway officers in question, such further appoint ments may not be contrary to the public interest. In the circumstances we think that the best course would be to recast the rules as follows :— The following shall be inserted as clause (c) of draft rule 14-A :— ' Notwithstanding the provisions of rule 14 (a), the lien of a Government servant holding substantively a permanent post shall be definitely terminated on his appointment substantively to any of the offices referred to in sub-rule (1) of rule 97 or to the post of Chief Engi neer of the Public Works Department '. The following shall be substituted for sub-rule (2) of Fundamental Rule 97 ' (2) When a Government servant holding substantively any of the offices referred to in sub-rule (1) of this rule or the post of Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department takes leave immediately on vacating his office or post, or if an officer of the Indian Medical Service holding an administrative post is given leave under rule 86, he shall during the leave be left without a lien on any permanent post. (3) If leave is taken immediately on vacating the post of Chief Commis sioner, Chief Engineer of the Railway Department or posts held by officers in the Superior Revenue Establishment of State Rail ways corresponding in rank to a Chief Engineer, the suspended lien of the Government servant which would otherwise revive under rule 14 (e) may be definitely terminated and the Government ser vant left during the leave without a lien on any permanent post In recasting the rule as above the post of Consulting Engineer to the Govern ment of ludia has been omitted as this post has been abolished. It will be necessary to insert the words 44 Except as provided in sub-rule (3) of rule 97 ' at the beginning of draft rule 14 (p) as suggested by you. The words ' Subject to the exception in rule 97 ' may also be inserted at the beginning of clause (d) of draft rule 13, and the words ' Except as provided in clause (c) of this rule and rule 97 ' at the beginning of draft rule 14-A (a). (6) We agree as to the necessity for amending Fundamental Rule 59 but, in view of the phraseology used in these draft rules, would prefer that this rule should be redrafted as follows :— ' Leave is earned by a Government servant under sections I to V of this chapter if he holds a lien on a permanent post in civil employ or would hold a lien on such a post had his lien not been suspended Similarly Fundamental Rule 111 (h) may be redrafted as follows :— ' the Government servant transferred holds, at the time of transfer, a post paid from general revenues, or holds a lien on a permanent post, or would hold a lien on such a post had his lien not been sus pended(7) Minor amendments are required in Fundamental Rules 63 and 124. In rule 63 the words ' holds a lien on his post in civil employ or would hold a lien on such a post had his lien not been suspended ' should be substituted for the words ' retains a lien on his post in civil employ and in rule 124 the words ' or would hold a lien had his lien not been suspended ' should be inserted after the word lien 3. With regard to your enquiry as to when the general re-draft of the Funda mental Rules will be ready, the position is that we have been obliged to postpone further work on the re-draft for the present. This work can be done satis factorily only by placing an officer on special duty for a considerable period, and this would involve expenditure which we do not consider to be justified in exist ing financial conditions. In the circumstances, we agree that it would be best to make these amendments in the lien rules forthwith. Kor facility of reference a revised copy of the draft rules incorporating the above amendments in italic# is enclosed. D raft amendments to the L ien R ules in the F undamental R ules. Rule 9. Substitute the following for clause (13) of this rule :— 9 (13). Lien means the title of a Government servant to hold substantively, either immediately or on the termination of a period or periods of absence, a permanent post, including a tenure post, to which he has been appointed sub stantively. Rules 13—15. Substitute the following for these rules :— 12-A. Unless in any case it be otherwise distinctly provided in these rules, a Government servant on substantive appointment to any permanent post acquires a lien on that post and ceases to hold any lien previously acquired on any other post. 13. Unless his lien is suspended under rule 14 or transferred under rule 14-B, a Government servant holding substantively a permanent post retains a lien on that post— {a) while performing the duties of that post ; (6) while on foreign service, or holding a temporary post, or officiating in another post ; (c) during joining time on transfer to another post ; unless he is trans ferred substantively to a post on lower pay, in which case his lien is transferred to the new post from the date on which he is relieved of his duties in the old post ; (d) subject to the exception in rule 97, while on leave ; and (e) while under suspension.

Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, To A ll MINOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. S ubject ; — Revised Leave Rules' for the Central Civil Services subject to the rule-making control of the Governor General in Council. S ir, I am directed to invite a reference to this Department letter No. F.12- (2)-R. 1/32, dated the 16th December 1933 and to communicate the decision of the Governor-General in Council in regard to the manner in which certain Fundamental and Supplementary Rules should be applied to Government Servants to whom the Revised Leave Rules 1933 apply. 2. When a revision of the Fundamental Rules is undertaken as a conse quence of the issue of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, the intention is that the rules in the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules which are applicable to the Secretary of State's Services and those which are applicable to the Governor-General in Coun cil's Services should be collected in separate codes of rules and that the Revised Leave Rules, 1933 may then be included in the code of rules for the Governor-General in Council's Services. It is also pro posed to make the revised leave rules self-contained at that time. Thus, ultimately, in addition to the rules for the Secretary of State's Services, there will be, in respect of the personnel under the rule-making control of the Governor General in Council, two separate sets of rules—each complete in itself—one for personnel governed by the existing rules and the other for personnel to whom the Revised Leave Rules 1933 are applicable. This will take some time, and until self- contained sets of rules are promulgated, difficulties may arise in applying some of the Fundamental Rules and Supplementary Rules to the personnel subject to the Revised Leave Rules 1933. A separate set of amendments to the Fundamental Rules and Supplementary Rules applicable to this per sonnel will complicate matters and it has been decided therefore that the following procedure should be observed in regard to matters not covered by the instructions contained in this Department letter of the 16th December 1933. 3. The leave rules in the Fundamental Rules and Supplementary Rules fall under the following three categories: — (1) General rules relating to leave on average pay, half average pay, quarter average pay and extraordinary leave;2 (2) Rules permitting certain additional kinds of leave in special cir cumstances, e.g., special disability leave (Fundamental Rules 83 and 83-A), Study Leave (Fundamental Rule 84), Maternity Leave (Supplementary Rules 267 and 268), Hospital Leave (Supplementary Rules 269, 270, etc.), Seamen's sick leave (Supplementary Rules 274-275), Departmental Leave (Supple mentary Rules 276—283), and (3) Special rules regulating the grant of leave to persons belonging to a special department or rendering a special kind of service, e.g., leave admissible to Motor Drivers of the Calcutta General Post Office (Supplementary Rule 283-A), leave to Government servants of the Bombay Salt Department whose service is not continuous (Supplementary Rules 286-A and 286-B), leave earned by part-time service (Supplementary Rules 287 and 288 v leave earned by service remunerated by fees or daily wages (Supplementary Rules 289 and 290) and leave to Military Officers in temporary civil employ (Fundamental Rule 100). 4. The rules in group (1) are the 'corresponding rules' within the meaning of the preamble to the Revised Leave Rules 1933 and they are, therefore, wholly superseded by these rules. The rules in group (2) as well as the leave procedure rules contained partly in the Fundamental Rules and partly in the Supplementary Rules, the rules prescribing the maxima and minima rates of leave salary for leave on average pay and half average pay and rules relating to travelling allowance to Government servants taking short leave before joining a new post are 'other rules' mentioned in para graph 1 of this Department letter dated the 16th December 1933. The special rules referred to in (3) above remain in force and persons governed by them do not come under the Revised Leave Rules 1933. The Government of India have also considered the question whether any changes should be- made in these rules in view of the revised leave rules and have decided (1) that no change may be made in Supplementary Rule 283-A, (2) that Supplementary Rules 286-A and 286-B may be applied subject to the following modifications; — (i) that leave admissible to a Government servant in permanent employ in inferior service should be limited under Supple mentary Rules 286-A and 286-B to l/24th and l/22nd of the period of duty respectively; (ii) that leave admissible under Supplementary Rule 286-A to a Government servant not in permanent employ, when he is in superior service, should be limited to l/24th of the period spent on duty, and that no leave is admissible under that rule to a Government servant not in permanent employ when he is in inferior service; (iii) that earned leave cannot be accumulated to an extent greater than 90 or 30 days according as the Government servant is in superior or inferior service; (iv) that the earned leave that can be sanctioned on medical certi ficate at a time under Supplementary Rule 286-A, and earned leave that can be sanctioned either with or without medical certificate at a time under Supplementary Rule 286- B should not exceed the limits mentioned in (iii) above; (v) that the basis of leave salary to be granted under the rules- should be full pay drawn prior to proceeding on leave. (3) that the terms laid down in Supplementary Rules 287 and 288, on which leave is admissible to certain Law Officers and Govern ment servants remunerated by honoraria under Supplementary Rule 289 may continue, with the exception of those laid down in clause (c) of Supplementary Rule 287. To these Government servants leave on medical certificate may be allowed subject3 to a maximum of 12 months during the whole service, without the restriction prescribed in clause (c) of Supplementary Rule 287 and when the maximum period of 12 months is exhausted, further leave on medical certificate not exceeding 6 months in all may be granted in exceptional cases on the recommenda tions of a medical board and (4) that in the case of new entrants coming under Fundamental Rule 100, the limit of four months in clause (a) of the rule should be interpreted to mean only 'earned leave not exceeding 90 days', inclusive of the yrhnlecje leave which was due to the officer on the date on which he became subject to Fundamental Rule 100, and that the provision contained in the proviso to rule 9 of the revised leave rules would apply. 5. The Government of India have also considered the question whether the additional kinds of leave referred to in (2) in paragraph 3 above should continue to be allowed to persons governed by the revised leave rules and they have decided that they should continue to be allowed to such persons. As regards the extent to which the rules relating to the grant of additional kinds of leave still remain operative, I am to communicate the following decisions of the Government of India. (i) Maternity Leave {Supplementary Rules 267-268). —No change may be made in the basis of leave salary. Supplementary Rule 268 provides that leave of any other kind may be granted in continuation of maternity leave, if the request for its grant is supported by medical certificate. Similarly under the revised leave rules, the requirement of a medical certificate should be satisfied before leave is granted in continuation of maternity leave. (ii) Hospital Leave—Supplementary Rules 269—273. —In Supple mentary Rule 270 the leave salary during hospital leave is either average or half average pay, the average pay being determined in accordance with Fundamental Rule 9(2). In the revised leave rules 'average pay has been defined differ ently and leave salary is based on average pay or the average substantive pay whichever is greater. In its application to new entrants. Supplementary Rule 270 will, therefore, present a difficulty and to obviate this, 'average or half average pay' may be taken to mean 'full or half pay'. The other rules will not present any difficulty and may continue to apply. (iii) Seamen's sick leave—Supplementary Rules 27A-275. —No change is necessarv in the basis of leave salary and the rules should, therefore, continue to apply. (iv) Departmental Leave—Supplementary Rules 276—283. —This- kind of leave is admissible to certain subordinates in superior service and inferior servants in the Survey of India Depart ment. Under Supplementary Rule 280, it is debited in the leave account against leave earned by duty and under Supple- mentarv Rule 281 the maximum leave that is admissible under Fundamental Rule 81(a) does not affect the grant of Departmental Leave. Again, in certain circumstances, vide Supplementary Rule 283. anv debit balance in the leave account may be cancelled. Under the revised leave rules temporary men in superior ser\ice and persons in service are not entitled to lea\e on private affairs. Onlv earned leave is calculated with reference to duty periods, and all other kinds of leave admissible to new entrants are not related to dutv and there is no leave account. In view of these differences between the leave rules in the Fundamental Rules and the revised leave rules, the following instructionst - N » should be observed—that in the case of subordinates in supe rior service and inferior servants. Departmental leave will be granted in addition to any other kind of leave for which they may be eligible under the Revised Leave Rules. That Departmental leave does not count as duty and that it may be combined with any other kind of leave admissible will still be in force. The basis of leave salary will also not be changed. (v) Special Disability Leave—Fundamental Rules 83, 83-A and 83-B. —The only changes which will be necessary are as indi cated below: — The limit of 4 months laid down in sub-clause («) of clause (7) of Fundamental Rule 83 may be taken to mean '90 or 30 days as ^ the case may be' and the term 'period of average pay' occur- ' ring in sub-clause (b) of clause (7) of this rule may be taken to mean 'earned leave'. Half the amount of leave on average pay under this sub-clause will be counted as earned leave taken and leave salary during special disability leave will be regulated under rule 16 of the revised leave rules. The term 'four months' in clause (iii) of Fundamental Rule 83-A, may be taken to mean '90 or 30 days as the case may be'. The concession in Fundamental Rule 83-B, will not be admissible to persons governed by the revised leave rules. (vi) Study LeUve—Fundamental Rule 8^ and the rules framed there under. —The study leave rules will remain in force subject to the following changes. During study leave, a Government servant will be entitled to the same leave salary as that admissible under rule 16(2) of the revised leave rules. 'Leave on average pay' occurring for the second time in rule 12 may be taken to mean 'earned leave' under the revised leave rules and the term 'during the first four months of a period of leave on average pay' shown within brackets in this rule may be taken to mean 'earned leave not exceeding 90 days'. 6. The following instructions may be observed in regard to the other rules in the Fundamental and Supplementary Rules mentioned below; — (i) Supplementary Rules 6{a) and (b). —The decision in this Depart ment letter dated the 16th December 1933 that 'leave on aver- age pay not exceeding four months' should be taken to mean 'earned leave not exceeding 90 or 30 days as the case may be' will not cover the limit of four months laid down in clause (a) of Supplementary Rule 6, since the leave mentioned therein is not leave on average pay not exceeding four months but leave ^ for a period not exceeding four months, which may not ^ * necessarily be leave on average pay for a period not exceeding four months. The same remarks apply to the leave mentioned in Supplementary Rule 143. The limit of four months laid down in these rules is based on the maximum limit of leave on average pay which can be taken under the ordinary leave rules in the Fundamental Rules. Earned leave under the revised leave rules is subject to the maximum of 90 or 30 days and this limit should be substituted for the limit of 4 months in apply ing the rules mentioned to persons governed by the revised leave rules. Similarly, the limit of 4 months prescribed in Supplementary Rule 6(&amp;) may also be changed to 90 or 30 days as the case may be. (ii) Supplementary Rules 216 to ^51.—These rules will continue to apply to persons governed by the Revised Leave Rules, subject to the proviso to rule 14 of these rules. Supplementary Rules 232 to 266 will also continue to apply.(iii) Supplementary Rules 291 and 292. —The revised leave rules do not make any provision for the grant of leave to probationers, and apprentices and Supplementary Rules 291 and 292 will, therefore, remain in force but Fundamental Rule 85 mentioned in Supplementary Rule 292 will be taken to mean ''rule 15- of the revised leave rules'. (iv) Fundamental Rules 89 and 90. —Under the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, a maximum limit has been imposed only in regard to* leave salary drawn during leave on private affairs or on medical certificate. It has been considered unnecessary tx&gt; impose any maximum limit in regard to leave salary drawn during earned leave or to give the benefit of a minimum leave salary in regard to any kind of leave. (v) Fundamental Rule- 105(b) (i) and Supplementary Rule 300.— The term 'leave on average pay of not more than four months duration' in these rules may be taken to mean 'earned leave not exceeding 90 or 30 days as the case may be'. (vi) Fundamental Rule 105(c) and Supplementary Rule 295. —The term 'four months' mentioned in these rules may be taken to mean '90 or 30 days as the case may be'. (vii) Fundamental Rule 128. —The words 'chapters I to XI of these rules' in this rule may be taken to mean 'chapters I to IX and XI of these rules and the Revised Leave Rules, 1933'. Employees of local funds administered by Government who are not paid from general revenues and are therefore not Government servants will be subject to the provisions of chapters I to IX and XI of Fundamental Rules and the Revised Leave Rules, 1933.

S ir, I eave a r SUlt of the Promulgation of the Revised cr'rnnt nf i f ffi question of revising the model leave term 3 for the grant of leave to officers engaged on contract in future has been nnrW consideration of the Governor-General in Council for so^ tfme and L k now pleased to prescribe the following terms in resmrt nf ' , ..bjw to hi, rutins control, to CEtE ^''.'0- ' '' (a) officers of Asiatic domicile engaged on contract whether in India or abroad, and muia (b) officers of non-Asiatic domicile engaged on contract but not sp^ cially recruited overseas for service in India (1) Where the contract is for one year or less, earned leave admis- sible will be at one-twenty-second of the period spent on duty 1 hough ranking as earned leave, this may be grant ed only on medical certificate, and if subsequentlv It be- u gr n the 0fficer further Ieave - after the mlv hi v' exh 1 aUSted &gt; leave on me dical certificate 'tl. , panted to him subject to the condition that the total period of the two kinds of leave does not exceed of the period spent on duty. 7 If the officer serves in a vacation Department, earned leave will not be admissible but he may be granted, if absolutely neces sary, leave on medical certificate to the extent of 1 /22iitl of the period spent on duty. ' (2) Where the contract is for more than one vear but not more than five years, leave on medical certificate may be allowed in addition to earned leave under Rule 10 (a) of the Revised airdnHn^tJ, 19 ^' ? U ^ ,ec P t to a maximum of four months in all during the period of contract. In addition, extra ordinary leave may be granted in special circumstances when no other leave is admissible subject to a total maxi mum limit of 3 months in respect of such leave.If the officer serves in a vacation Department, earned leave will not be admissible. 1 ..'T (:-g) -oT'I (3) Where the contract is for a longer term than five years or an contract for fiye. years or less is extended so as to make the total period of'-contract longer than five years, leave admissible to a permanent Government servant under the Revised Leave Rules, 1933, may be allowed, subject to the restrictions that no leave on private affairs will be grant ed and that the leave on medical certificate will be limited to six months in all. In the case of extension of contract .to .ai period longer than 5 years the officer will be credited with the earned leave that would have ^en admissible had the contract been initially one of more than five years diminished b y any earned leave already taken, and leave on medical certificate if any alreadv taken, will count against the six months' limit prescribed. v G i Dili; v ! t;j - Cr . ; v (4) Where the contract is for an indefinite period,-the lea^ve rules for permanent Government' servants in the Revised 'Leave Rules, 1933, except rule 16 of those Rules regulating leave salary, will be made applicable. (6). In the case of an officer falling under clauses (2) to (4) above, earned leave may be granted after the expiry of the contract only when it has been applied for during the period of tKe contract and refused owing to the exigencies of the public service. An officer whose services are dispensed with on . grounds of ill-health may be permitted to take all earned ^ leave due to him before his service is terminated. (6) The terms 'earned leave 'leave on medical certificate' and leave on private affairs' used in the above clauses have the same meaning as that assigned to them in the Revised Leave Rules, 1933. The leave salary during leave taken under the above clauses will be regulated as follows: — fx, I vi (i) An officer on earned leave is entitled to leave salarv equal to his average pay. (ii) An officer on leave on private affairs or on medical certi ficate is entitled to leave salary equal to half his average pay subject in either case to a maximum of Rs. 750. Note.- -Average pay means the average monthly pay earned during the 12 complete months preceding the month in which the event occurs which necessitates the calculation of average pay. (iii) An officer on extraordinary leave is not entitled to any leave salary. (7) An officer initially engaged on contract becomes subject to the Revised Leave Rules, 1033, in their entirety on his being taken into permanent employment after the expiry of his contract. In such a case the officer will be credited with the earned leave that would have been admissible had his pre vious duty been duty as an officer in permanent employ diminished by any earned leave already taken, and leave on medical certificate if any already taken, will count against the limit prescribed in Rule 14 of the Revised Leave Rules 1933. ,,2. Ihe Governor-General in Council has also been pleased to decide that the model leave terms published in the Government of India, Finance De partment letter No. r.-31-G. S. 11.-24, dated the 11th October 1924 as subse quently modified, will continue to apply to officers of non-Asiatic domicile under his rule-making control, who are specially recruited overseas for ser vice in India, till they are revised in accordance with the leave terms that may be prescribed in future for new entrants to the services under the rule making control of the Secretary of State.

Subject:- Greneral provident Fund .(Central Services) Kules. I have the honour to invite a reference to the General Provident Fund Central oervioes) liules and to inquire what the intention of the Government of India is in regard to the points referred to against the rules noted 'below: (ll a vjle 10(2) ; Tlxis rule requires intimation to the Account Officer of a suhscriher's election not to subscribe during leave, in the case of Gazetted Officers and Mon-Gazet.od Officers who have been authorised to draw their own pay hills, if no deduction is made in the leave salary hill, it can 'be taken to mean that they have not elected to suh- scrihe and the option may be taken to have been communicated to the -Account Officer by action taken in the bill. In the case of other officers, the proper person to whom the election should be communi cated seems to be the officer who draws the pay bill of the subscriber ana the Account Officer can assume that the subscriber has elected not to subscribe^ if no deduction is made in the bill. 1 would, there fore, suggest that no separate intimation need be insisted on. 12) Kule 11(3) (d ) and (S) ; Here too, the object of the written intimation or conimunication to the Accounts Officer is not clear, as the rate elected can be checked with reference to the actual de duction made in the leave slary bill, or the amount actually credited into the treasury by a subscriber on foreign service. A , ul es 10 15 I and 21 i 3); The recoveries relorr^d to in these rules are to be made by deduction •1 m.— * • — -M froiTi the emoluments of the suhscri ber by instalments or otherwise as aay direct- it may kindly 'be stated whether Audit cannot go hy the decision of Executive authorities (iieads of Offices of -Leparoments as Government may choose to fix), only cases of undue hardship or the reverse, 'being referred to Clovernment for orders as the final authority, or whether each such case should invariably 'be referred to Government for orders as seims to 'be contemplated 'by the r ules. aie latter procedure will, I venture to think, involve additional work to the Government as well as to the Account Office, 14) x&gt; uio 2412) 8 In regard to policies of a sole heneficiary type financed out of withdrawals from the Provident '^und and maturing 'before a subscriber quits service, there does not seem to be, under the rule, an obligation on his part to restore the amounts withdrawn to his account in the i'und. It may kindly be stated whether the above position is correct, as a subscriber can apparently make final withdrawals in this manner from the fund even without quitting servi ce. (5) ^ul^s 29 and 50 : It is presumed that, with reference to the provisos to these rules, the orders re-instating a dismissed Grovernment servant or order ing the return to duty of a Government servant, on leave preparatory to retirement, will contain a direction regarding the recovery or otherwise of the Fund moneys withdrawn by him and that such orders will be coTLmunicated to the Account Officer for watch ing recovery. (6) .uiile 31 a no Appendix The nomination forms prescribed in the first and the second schedule to the rules do not provide for t he appointment of guardians to whom payment may be made on behalf ofrt &lt;v the ciinor nominees.

Subject:- Instructions for the guidance of officers who receive and handle cash. Sir, I am directed t-o say that the Government of India have decided that the following rules should be observed by; all Government servants (except the treasury and other officials for whose guidance separate detailed rules already exist) who are required to receive and handle c a sh ; - (1) Each officer receiving money on behalf of Government should maintain a Cash Book in the prescribed form. (2) AH cash transactions should be entered in the Cash Book as soon as they occur. (3) The Cash Book should be closed regularly and completely checked. At the end of each month the officer in charge of the Cash Book should personally verify the cash balance. (4) V/hen money is received by a Government servant, a receipt should be granted to the payer. This receipt should be signed only by a responsible officer who should satisfy himself at the time that the amount has been entered in the Cash Book, (5) Receipt Books in form S~119 should be used in all cases and the blank books should be kept inthe safe custody of the officer who will use them. {b) 'Xh e use of peons to fetch or carry money should be discouraged. Vihen it is absolutely necessary to employ an inferior servant for this purpose, men of some length of service and proved trustworthiness should only be selected and, in all cases, when the amount to ,be handled is large, more than one messenger should be employed (7) A Government servant who handles Government money should,not, except with the special sanction of the head of the office, be allowed to handle also in his official capacity money which does not belong to Government. Where under any special sanction, Government servant deals with both Government and non- Government money in his official capacity, the Government money should be kept in a cash box seperate from the non-Government money and the transactions relating to the latter should be accounted for in a separate set of books and kept entirely out og Government account. (8) In the case of payments into treasuries the disbursing officer should compare the Treasury Officer's receipt on the chalan with the entry in the cash book before initialling it, and when such payments are appreciable, he should obtain from the Treasury a monthly list of payments which should be compared wit a the posting in the cash book. (9) Public money not in the custody of a treasury should be k^pt in strong treasure chests and secured by two leeks of different patterns.All keys of the^ same lock should be kept in the same person's custody and as a general rule, the keys ot one lock should be kept apart from the keys of the other lock and in a different person's custody when practicable. V/hen there is a police guard, the officer in charge of such guard should be entrusted with the custody of the keys of one lock, and the chest should never be opened without both the custodians of the keys being present. The officer in charge of the police guard '.where such guard is provided) should always be present when the treasure chest is opened and until it is again locked. 2. The cash book form referred to in para 1(1) above is being standardised in the Government of India standard n C.A.C.' series with the distinguishing number C.A.C.i8.

Copy of a letter No.F.126/34-S.j dated the 3rd Iky, 1935, from the Secretary, Public Service Commission, to the Government of India, Home Department. i am directed to refer to the Home Department Notification No.F»510/31-Ests., dated the 7th June, 1934, in which the Crovernment Servants' Applications for Posts, Central Services, Rules were promulgated. Rule 2 of these rules provides that an officer in the service of a local government shall not be eligible for appointment to any post ^n the Central Service with out the consent of the local sg government concerned. The Commission have recently received ^n application from a candidate employed in the Department of Agri culture, Punjab, which has been forwarded by the Director of Agriculture, who is the appointing authority for the post held by the candidate in question. Under the rules made by the Punjab Government in this connection (copy enclosed) the consent of the appoint ing authority is sufficient to enable an officer in the service of that Government to apply for post under another government. Under the Government of India's rule, however, the Public Service Commission ire unable to accept the applicitibn in question without the consent of the PunjaqGovernment. 2. The Public Service Commission believe that the Govornmont of India's rules wore framed solely with a view to the protection ^f local governments, and they consider that if the rules made by a local Government are satisfied it is unnecessary, for this purpose, to require the formal consent of the local Government itself. They propose, therefore, to interpret the Government of 1 V} r Pi H if-2- JjL , India's rule in future to mean that such rules as may have been laid.down by the local Government in this connection must be duly observed, and that if they have been observed the consent of the local Government may be presumed. I im to inquire whether the Government of India approve of this interpretation. nHome Department. Gazette. The 23rd November,1934. No.32627.- In exercise of the powers conferred by rules 41, 42 and 44 of the Civil Services (Classifica tion, Control ind Appeal) Rules, xnd in supersession of ill previous orders on the subject, the Government of the Punjab ire pleased to nuke the following rules regarding Government servants seeking private employment or employment in other Departments of this Government or any other Government, provided that nothing in these rules sin 11 affect the terms of contract of any Government servant to the contrary. F art I &gt; 1.(1) A Government servant shall not apply for employment, private/nor shall he signify his willingnes Private employment. to accept such employment without the previous permission of the appointing luthority of his post or service. (2) An application for permission to apply for private employment shall not be entertained unless such authority is satisfied that the premature resignation of the applicant may be accepted without detriment to the public service. (3) If a Government servant, who is refused permission to apply for private employment, wishes to resign his appointment under Government, such resignation shall ordinarily be accepted. (4) A Government servant, who is permitted to ipply for private employment, must, on accepting it, resign his appointment under Government.

Method or allocation of leave salaries of Crovernment servants subject to the .ji ^-Revised Leave l^ules. ^ n'O w am directed to say that the Government of India have now decided that in respect of the officers subject to the Hevised Leave Rules a tysjsein of recovery from 'borrowing Government of contribution for leave salary at the rates laid down tor foreign service contributions should he introduced with retrospective effect from the date of introduction of the Revised Leave itules i.e. 16th July 1931. The existing rates will he applied for a period of five years in the first instance or until the data of introduction of the revised rates of leave salary contributions whichever is earlier. 2. I am also to add that the Government of India suggest that the arrangement set forth in paragraph 1 above be reciprocal i.e. if any Local Government has framed revised leave rules similar to the Goveminent of India's rules, which make the calculation of leave in relation to the period of duty impossible, contributions on account of the leave salary of an other officer who is lent to another Government and who is subject to the local Government's revised leave rules, should be made at the rates laid down for foreign service contributions 3. The liability of a borrowing Government to pay contributions to the lending Government will cease when a Government servant is permanently transferred to the former; the procedure to be followed in such cases will be as illustrated below? Suppose that a Government servant subject to the Bevised Leave .'Rules, who has rendered 5 years' serviceVh mm 2. ,^S under Governinent 'A*, was at first lent to ^overnme, *3• for two years and thereafter was permanently transferred to that Government. The payment of leave contribution to Crovernraent 'A* hy Grovemment 'Bf will cease from the date on which the Grovernment servant is permanently transferred to the latter Grovemment; 'but Grovernment 'A* will remain responsible for the leave salary of the Government servant in pnucanunt respect of ^earned leave - at credit on the date of his permanent transfer to Government 'B*, i.e. ^earned leave*• up to such extent as can 'be granted to him under the Revised Leave Hulec* The Audit Officer of Government •A* should draw up a subsidiary leave account indicating therein the amount of 'earned leave ,, f leave salary for which should 'be borne by Government 'A 1 , and s ?nd it to the Audit Officer of Government 'B*. The latter should pass on the debit in regard to leave salary for 'earned leave - up to the extent indicated in the subsidiary leave account as and when the Government servant in question takes that leave after permanent transfer to Government # B\ The amount of 'earned leave 1 * in the subsidiary leave account should be exhausted first by the Government servant before any leave in respect of service on permanent transfer under Government 'B* is taken by him. The leave salary in respect of any other kind of leave which may be taken by the Government servant after his permanent transfer to Governm nt f B # under the leave rules of that Government will, however, be borne by that Govermtient and the fact that the Government servant previously rendered some service under Government 'A*should not affect the question, as the grant of such leave has no necessary relation to the period of actual service under the latter Government# 4. I am to express the hope that the local Government are agreeable to the adoption of the procedure indicated in paragraphs 2 and 3 above. 4V A EC'S DEPAKTW^TT. Kctif loritlcn.
