As mentioned in last week's Summary the Air Force waA^grounded after .the desertion of two pilots with their aircraft to Tabriz. This order has not yet been countermanded. 2* Major General NAKHCHEVAN, known locally as the father of the Persian Air Force is one of the officers nominated to attend the Victory Celebrations in London in June. Although a complete party has been nominated there appears to be a political conflict in progress in the Persian Government which might well delay the departure of the party until it is too late. This is probably a Persian move to overcome what might be an embarrassing situation. 3* The Aircraft State as at the 24th April, 19A-6 of the Air Force is shov/n in Appendix 'A' together with details of the state of the Iranian State Airline, Oil Company, and other foreign aircraft in Persia. The positioning of Air Force aircraft is as follows;- MESHED KERMANSHAH. 3 Hinds 4 Hinds 3 Tiger Moth. 2 Hinds 2 Tiger Moth. 3 Hinds 2 Tiger Moth, SHIRAZ HAMADAN AHWAZ The remaining aircraft are in the vicinity of TEHRAN, i.e. DOSHAN TAFPEH, QAIEH MORGHEII and BASHGAH. PERSIAN CIVIL AIRLINES. 4* There is no change in the serviceability state of the Iranian State Airl: Spares have not arrived and until they do only the Rapide can be operated. 5. In conversation with A. YffiKILI, wrongly spelt as FEKILI in last week's Summary, it would appear that the Iranian Airways, a now airline fostered by EBTAHAJ \iEKILI and others, is intended to be a private company. NEKILI stated that they were still interested in buying a small number of 6 to 8 seater aircraft for internal services. A proposal is being made to Air Ministry by the Air Attache conoering terms of purchase should a definite order be coming from VffiKILI. GENERAL. 6 . MR. COLBECK, Civil Air Attache for the Middle East visited TEHRAN on tie 22nd. april when B.O.A.C, sent in a special Dakota with the new Ambassador, Mr. J.H. Le Rougetel. MR, HOUTCHIN, B.O.A.C. representative from Cairo also arrived together with two B.O..A.C. ground staff to assist in handling B.O.A.C. aircraft on the new service. MR, COLBECK and MR, HOUTCHIN met Mr* 3HAFIK, the Director Designate of the •oibryo Persian Civil Air Department. Discussion centred namely upon ABADAN which the Persians are keen to maintain as a international airport. Asked for advice MR, COLBECK suggested that perhaps BASRAH would in the future attract more airlines than ABADAN and the Persian. Government might ultimately find themselves with a 'White Elephant' in ABAD4N. 7* The first B.O.A.C. aircraft of the new service arrived on time on the 27th. The service is once weekly between ATHENS and TEHRAN via CYPRUS, BEIRUT, LYDDA and BAGHD/H. CYIRUS and LYDDa stops being optional depending upon requirements. The link up with the ATHENS - UNITED KINGDOM service is not very satisfactory as only six seats on the UNITED KINGDOM aircraft are available at ATHENS of which three of these are believed to be reserved for ATHENS, thus leaving only three for the ten passengers arriving in the TEHRAN aircraft.AIRCRAFT STATE AS AT 2ATH APRIL ,, JL9^- APPENDIX ”A' Type.

There has been growing opposition from a faction of senior officers in the Ministry of War to the sending to the United Kingdom of Persian pilots and ground staff for training. This faction is headed by BRIGADIER HADAYAT, Under Secretary of War. It would appear that friends of his haave made contact with Ajnerican aircraft firms and possibly the United Sta.tes Air Force and they probably aaw an opportunity for self gain if they placed an order with the Americans as apposed to tit; Hurricane agreement in which they were unable to stick their fingers. The opposition may now decrease with the Persian freedom from the physicrj. proximity of the Russians in Persia, 3. MAJ/GEN. NAKHCHEVAN, as mentioned in last week's summary is one of the Persian senior officers who hm left for England to represent Persia at the Victory Parade, Accompanying him, r.part from Army Officers and men there is an Air Force Cdlonel and about 9 senior 'Air. Poree - N.C.O's. In view of the difficulties being put in the way of sending Persian Air Force personnel to the United Kingdom it maybe worth showing the abovementioned Persian Air Force personnel around suitable sections of the Royad Air Force in the United Kingdom a.nd the Middle East. PERSIAN C IV IL AIRLINE S. 4. The Ra.pide is still the only aircraft operating the Iranian Staote Airline service to Baghdad. 5. During the week the Air Attache met MR. ALI UEKILI, \ftio is one of the wealthy Persians connected with the new airline (ira.nian Airways), mentioned in previous summaries, ’./EKILI was quite candid about tine agreement with T. J.A., the /the details of which rjre mucl/same a.s given previously. 6 . v/BKT LT also started that he and his associates 'v/ere still interested in acquiring a. small number of 6 - 8 passenger aircraft for short feeder line operations. He has always ’..anted to buy British but in the absence of a.ny suitable British aircraft for the trunk lines he was attracted by the American offer of Dakotans. He explained that the difficulty facing the coiipany was to obtain credit for the purchr.se of aircraft and equipment. The Air irfctache mentioned that a certain sum was still owing to the Persian Government by the Royal Air Force and that if V/EKILI could obtain Government approval to purcho.se aircrr.ft against this sum, then the Air Attache would raise the matter with the Air Ministry, It would be a pity at this time to lose . . the . . market for British aircraft and anciliary equipment to the Americans. Persia is for the greater part of the year suited to the successful operation of internal airlines as the weather is generally good and air distances over mountain ranges short while road and rail journeys are tedious and lengthy. FOREIGN AIRLINES. 7. The first B.O.A.C. Lodestar of the TEHRAN, BAGHDAD, LYDDA, BEIRUT, ATHENS service left on the 2nd of May. Instructions from Civatt Cairo cAithorioing Uo to carry 7 through passengers to the United Kingdom unfortunately crossed an ^.ir Ministry signal suggesting that our quota on the Tehran/Uunited Kingdom service should be only 3. The resulting confusion at ATHENS allowed them to take 3 of the 7 passengers off and only send on two• If two or three is to be Tehran's quota on this service, then, apart from its effect on local public opinion it .ill almost certainly result in the aircraft flying from Lyuda to Athens with only a Tehran quota. A proposal has been put up to the Air Ministry for an amended service which it is hoped would employ the. fo/o Lodestars on a United Kingdcsn- Tehran service linking at Athens. 8 , Air France is about to operate a weekly service TEHRAN, BEIRUT, CAIRO.

The flight was undertaken in the Air Attache's Anson XII and to secure the necessary range an extra 80 gallons had to be carried in A gallon tins in the fuselage with which to top up the overload tank. The flight was made in ^asonably good weather, the distance cow red was approximately 1,000 miles and wfie flying time 7 hours A5 minutes. W/T contact was maintained with Tehran at hourly intervals. The route was as follows: - TEHRAN , ZEN JAN, MIAHEH (70 miles N.7A of ZENJ/JT on the railway) thence due west to i.l/lbV-GEII thence by coastal road along lake URMIA to iiZAR SHi'HR, then to the railway junction approximately 20 miles N.VA of TABRIZ and along the railway and road, to DZHULPA on the AZERBAlJiiN/RUSuIil'f border. From there to the North west of lake URMIA and along its west coast road down to MEHABAD thence along the road to lvIUIi‘NDUi*B, thence to ZEN JAN and TEHRAN. No road or rail activity of any significance was seen anywhere along the route except between MARAND and DZHUIFA where the following forces were observed on the road.

A few of the lorries in the vehicle pank at DZHUIFA had a 3‘ white square on the roof of the cab with a 1‘ black square in the middle. 3* Democrat forces were seen in bar ranks at 1 LARAGHEH. some drilling in Russian looking uniform on the parade ground.

The Persian Air Force is now doing a limited amount of flying although flights are still strictly controlled and only aircrews whose loyalty is beyond question are allowed to fly. Nevertheless precuution has been taken of only allowing them sufficient petrol for local flights. 2. Lieutenants JOURI and SARBA.KH mentioned in paragraph 3 of Summary number 2 as having deserted with their aircrof’t to Tabriz are now reported to have made flights over Tabriz dropping leaflets signed by themselves in which they confirm that they deserted to escape the ''Reactionaries' and join the free Azerbaijanies. They also state that more Iranian officers will follow* If the present trend in the Air Force continues this might well happen as the new Head of the A.ir Force, Army General AMIDI is becoming more and more unpopular owing to his dictatorial and uninformed actions* It is reliably reported that he is under the influence of BRIGADIER HADAYAT t/ho is apposed to the British influence in the Persian Air Force and especially to the Hurricane project. In connection with the latter great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the Ministry of ’7ar's approval to dispatching COLONEL SIAH POOSH and other officers to the United Kingdom for training. The Air Attache and the Military Attache intend to see tne Ministry of Nar and to force this issue into the open as unless the anti-Hurricane faction in the Ministry of .ar is nipped in the bud they will succeed not only in preventing the training of Persian Air Force personnel but they will undoubtedly so upset the loyal officers of the Persian Air Force that they may well either resign or consider deserting to the Azerbaijan forces. 3# The Vice Consul at Tabriz reports, that he has seen officers of the Azerbaijan forces in uniforms whichpass for the Azerbaijan Air Force. This uniform is a cross between Persian and Russian the only feature distinguishing i..‘:ifrom the Azerbaijan Amy being a form of wings on the cap. PERSIAN CIVIL AIRLINES. 4. The State Airline claims to operate a twice weekly services TEHRAN - KERMANSHAH - BAGHDAD and return and twice -weekly service TEHRAN - ISFAHAN -SHIRAZ- BUSHIHE and return. How they maintain this service with one Rapide is a bit of a nystery but it is hoped that their Dominies 'will soon be serviceable again, when they should be able to maintain these services. 3* There is no fresh information of the date when the new airline (Iranian Airways) is to start operating with their Dakotas, 6 . After mary months of indecision it is now reported that the Persian Government is to debate on the 13 th the question of the establishment of a Department of Civil Aviation. It is not thought that 3HAFIK will be its Director if the Department of Civil Aviation is brought into being, as he is connected \/ith the Court and Also an Egyptian. He v/ould probably fill the position of Technical Advisor in which capacity he would be extremely useful. FOREIGN AIRLINES. 7# B.O.A.C. and Air France representatives in Tehran have been very active in trying to force the Ministry of Posts,and Telegrrphs to improve the radio facilities at Me hr ab ad and to establish at an early date weather reporting stations^ at Isfahan, Hamadan and Kermanshah. The difficulty in the past has been to tie down the responsibility for these services on to this Ministry as they have been inclined to delay matters in the hope that the Depa~rtment of Civil Aviation would be raised to handle these mr.tters*8 .

At lajlt a little head\/ay has been made in selecting suitable Iranian Air Force efficers and men to go on courses to England and the Middle East. It was doubtful at one time vdiether BRIGADIER AMID I, the Head of the Air Force, was supporting the Hurricane project, but it now appears that after talks wi-th the Air Attache and the Minister of \/ar, a great deal cf misunderstanding v/as cleared up, and he is now doing his best to send the most suitable people abroad. The Iranian Air Force personnel due to leave for courses abroad v/ill be vetted by the Air Attache to ensure that they have an adequate kncv/ledge of English and that they are technically equipped for the courses. 2. There is no news of interest concerning the operation of the Iranian Air Force. 3. It is common practice to employ Air Force Officers and men for duties with the Iranian State Airline. These personnel are still under the control of the Air Force, and continue to wear Air Force uniform. PERSIAN CIVIL A IRLINES.. A* There is no change in the serviceability of the Iranian State Airline’s A aircraft. The services operated by the serviceable Dominie and Rapide are a twice weekly service to BAGHDAD via KERMANSHAH and a once weekly service to BUSHIRE via ISFAHAN and SHIRAZ. Although these services are supposed to operate on specified dates they are often cancelled for one reason ^r another and although the number of services is maintained they do not necessarily run on the dates specified. The present chief pilot of the State Airline L/COL. MUSTAFAVT, on loan from the Air Force ,recently approached the Air Attache concerning suitable British civil aircraft for this line. As his enquiries were very tentative he './as given all the available information at hand concerning present or projected British aircraft and he has undertaken to return in a short time with a more definite idea of the needs of the State Airline. 5. As mentioned in paragraph 4 of loct vreek's summary the new private comparer, Iranian Ain/ays, has begun to operate its first Dakota with a T.’T.A. crew. This aircraft is at the moment engaged in making a series of proving flights. .In the last week two flights have been made between Tehran a.nd Meshed, one Tehran - Abadan and one tc Cr.iro. On all these flights prying pctssengers v/ere carried. 6 . It is now confirmed by local papers thr.t a Persian Civil Air Department has been formed. It will however according to the papers be a subsidiary Department of the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones. SHAFIK is apparently not to figure in the Department at all but at the same time he is to be their chief Technical Advisor. It is thought that COLONEL STODAKH mentioned in paragraph 2 of last week's summary v/ill be the first Director of this ne. Department. From our point of view this will be most suitable as STODAKH is one of the few reliable and honest Persians, who ha.s alv/ays remained nlwof from Politics and Partisan activities. He will undoubtedly do a good job if he is appointed to this position and he will at the same time be able to keep in touch with aviaticn in general so thaab in perhaps six months\ A, # / FOREIGN AIRLINGS. 7.

SECRET. fi * KB RSIAN AIR FORCE. 1. On the 21st the Air Attache,accompanied by an officer from the General Staff, had a meeting with the Head of the Air Force concerning the Hurricanes and provision of spares for the Air Force. From shipping documents held by the Ministry of Ear and seen by the Air Attache f»r the first time, it would appear that e. great deal of the equipmentbas either arrived or is in transit. The main outstanding item now being the questi®n of motor transport which has been referred to before. 2. On Wednesday 23rd Wing Commander Gibbs, Hawkers Pil®t, demonstrated a Hurricane to H. I.M. the Shah at Qaleh .iorgheh airfield. The latter v/as favourably impressed. 3. On Saturday afternoon, in celebration of the Shah's 2yth Birthday, a large military parade was held. The military side is dealt with in the British Military Attache's Summary. From the point of view of the Air 9 Ansons flew over at about 1,000 feet in flights of three and scattered pamphlets and National flags. They were followed by 12 Hinds in flights of three who also scattered literature, coleured paper and small paper flags. 9 Tiger Moths flew low over the square and two flights of 3 returned afterwards at roof top height. 4 . Y/nile in conversation with tne Herd of the Air Force and one of the Air Force's Medical Officers, the Air Attache learnt that there is no standard medical examination for aircrew. On initial entry aircrew have to produce a medical certificate to say that they have been found fit in all respqcts. Subsequently they shiuld have an annual examination, but no minimum standard exists, and it is left to the Medical officer or private practitioner's discretion to issue a certificate saying that the officer is fit in all respects for flying or not. 3 . In conversation with a senior Air Force officer it was confirmed that a number of officers of the Air Force are going abroad •n various courses but that in all ca.ses they will have to meet living expenses from their own pay, in some cases travelling expenses and fir the cost of the course, although the lalter is doubted. Officers are going to France, U.3.A. JSngland and some have beep nominated for the U.S.S.R. , but a.s the Russians are demanding £1,200 per annum per officer for a 2 to 3 years course none has yet been sent. PERSI AN CIVIL AVIATION. 6 . Civil aviation Department. - It was moped that Mr.Chafik, the Persian Director of Civil Aviation, would be accompanying the Air Attache to Quetta, on the 27th. Owing to pressing business in Teheran however Chafik has had to stand down. This is just as well as the Government of India state that no officer is available to discuss Civil Aviation affairs in Quetta during the Air nttaohe's visit. Y/ith the arrangements for the flight so far advanced it has been decided to visit Quetta despite the absence of the opportunity to discuss Civil Aviation.

Y/ing Commander Gibbs states that the Shah has indicated that he wishes to ba given dual on Hurricanes when the dual aircraft arrive. The present commander of the Anson Squaoron, Major NASIRI has stated tnat he is in the running for command of the Hurricane Squadron hhen it is eventually formed. This offu-cer appears to be efficient and resouroeful and should make a good Commanding Officer. 3. On his flight to and from Quetta during the week, the Air Attache called at Kerman and Zahidan. At Kerman there is an Air Force detachment of two Hinds' and one Tiger Moth used principally for comitunication purposes by the General Officer Commanding. There is no detachment at Zahidan. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIAT ION. 4. On the 28th. , when passing through Zahidan, the Air Attache met Mr. M. Hadi, Governor of Zchidan area. It has been apparent for some time that an airline between Quetta, and Zahidan would be of great benefit to travellers. At the moment, however, it would appear that the Government of India is preoccupied with other malters and although the Iranian Airways could extend their present service terminating at Zahidan, to Quetta, it is thought that it will be some time before an Indian airline will be ready to fly a reciprocal service. This matter was discussed in Quetta by the Air Attache with various Government officials. 77itu Iranian Airways putting out feelers to ' operate Services to London and India, the time is now considered ripe ^ for the question of bi-lateral air agreements between H.M. Government, Government of India and the Persian Government. 5 . Mr. Chafik, the D.C.A. is making full use of Iranian Airways and the surplus American ’wireless equipment available in the Middle East for improving Y//T, point to point and Radio navigational facilities. Unlike B.O.A.C., Ifanian Airways appear to be able to bring i*to the country any amount of equipment without any Customs difficulties. 6 . Irania n State Airline. There is nothing fresh to report. 7.

Y/hilst at Zahidan the Air Attache met Colonel Mustafril, ex Chief pilot of the State Airline, now flying as second pilot in Iranian Airways, He confirmed the fact that the aircraft of this Company nearly always flew half empty, and that tney must be opera ting at a severe loss.

It has received the blessing of the Government and tne Director o f Civil Aviation, and .is shortly to be registered. The Company wishes to acquire tv. r o Airspeed Consuls and two 2—seater Austers to begin operations. Th^yrequire a British Manager, technical and ground staff. One of the Directors of the Company, Mr. Madon, is at present in Europe and is being advised by his fellow Directors to proceed to England to conclude the necessary purchases and obtain the services of the personnel required. The Commercial Secretary and the Air Attache are advising the appropriate authorities in England. FOREIGN AIRL INES. 9. B.O.A.C. B.O.A.C. service arrived on Monday the 2dth instead of the previous day ov/ing to delay in the connecting B.E.A. service at Athens. The shuttle flight to Lydda was therefore carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday the aircraft left on its normal schedule flight to Athens. 10. Air France. The bi-mionthly Air France service now arrives on Thursday and leaves the following day. The next service leaves Teheran on Friday the 8 th. 11. Russian. No fresh information available. 12.

The aircraft is to be a D.C.4 and on this flight passengers are only being accepted as far as Ankara. GENERAL. 13 . As previously mentioned the Air Attache flew to Quetta via Kerman and Zabidan on the 27th and 2dth., returning on the 3«th and 31st., by the same route. The runway at Kerman is in go*d condition. The main concrete runway at Zahidan is also in good condition nr is the water-bound gravel macadam run'.ray, although the latter is rtrpfljr used it has not been rolled for some time and there are numerous‘ small sharp flints and pebbles which could damage tyres. It is ootioeable that the concrete runways are best fitted for the climatic condition of Persia and fortunately for aircraft operators they need little attention.

PERSIAN AIR I : 0 ]a 0L. 2. On Tuesday 5th., .Ir. Lloyd, Hn.iaers Overseas Seles Manager arrived in Teheran aXter visiting Irc.q. Subsequen'Qymeetings ' ere held v.dth tne Head oi the Air Force, the Minister of or, and he also visited Caleb iiorgheh airfield i.'ere the Hurricanes are being erected. The Persians, nor.: that the Hurricanes are flying, have lost all their doubts about the qualities of these aircraft, and enthusiasm has taken the place of criticism. Regrettably the foui dual Hurricanes have‘had to be held irj PJngland pending their modification. The Head of the Air Force is nor anxious for these aircraft to be flom to Ftersia to save time. During his stay in Teheran, Mr. Lloyd made efforts to agree upon a provisional contract for the Hawker team, covering the period from their arrival in Teheran to the arrival and test flight of the last Hurricane, when the existing contract commences. He made little headv/ay a.s the j.-ersiams insisted that their Air Attache in London vas resionsible / for the Hawker agreement and they v/ould only promise to instruct him to go into the matter with Barkers. The existing contract is for tv;o years and the Persians have suddenly realised that tney have on tnexr doorstex^, nine hignly skilled tecnnicians who could give all the 'Tactical and theoretical training necessary ark. so save the Persians the expense of sending x^^s^hnel abroad. At the moment in consultation with ing Commander Gibbs and .ir. Peters, they are cira .ing ut&gt; a training programme. The seventh Hurricane has no been successfully test flown by ing Commander Gibbs. 3 . The He^d of tne Air Force has not yet committed himself to the purchase oi Harvards, a.no. .ing Commander Giobs is active amongst” the Persian Officers in xushing the advantages of Hag is ter s for elementary amid possibly Hasters for adva need training. It is thought, however, that the extremely lo it ice of the Harvards will v/eigh the scales against any offer T/e can make. A. It is now leiTnt thait the recaPLl of Gol. Bayendor, tne Persian Air Attache in London,has been postxioned, £ nd that he has been instructed to coiax-l^te ail the matters connected with tne Hurricanes end ancillary equipment, when the question of his successor will be again considered. 5 . Between the oth and the 12th., the Air Attache fie'' the Ambassador to Meshed, Zfhidan and Kerman. The tour went acco uin^ to plan and '/T contact was maintained with Teheran throughout, thus providing the Embassy with information on the Amba-.sscdors movements. This is x&gt;articularly necessairy as telegrauas, the only other raeams of communication, usually trice up to two days to reach Teheran from disto.nt parts of Persia. There is nothing to add to previous reports on the airfields at Meshed, Zahidan and Kerman, or the Persian Air lore© Detachments at Meshed and Kerman*Page.3/, i - T -'S HjRS IAN C IVIL AVIATION. 54 d^rinr ^ Air Attrche in conventions fortmgnt with Us.

This would interfere with the A.I.O.C’s l/T schodules witn Abadan, ana they quite understandably feel that Chafik has only to supply one radio operator to mann the station we set uo there soLr two months ago. A 1^1. Air France has for sane time been carrying airmail to western gui’ ope, and now it would appear that airmail for other warts is to be sent by Iranian Air /ays. This will deprive the St ate' Airline of its main revenue.

An example of tne njethods this Company employs ras their recent application to this Embassy for visas for tneir pilots to fly to Karachi. On being informed that visas could not be granted until the Company had an agreement with the Government of India, Commander Barker, their derations Mancger, stated that this was incomprehensible as all T.U.A. pilots Operating in tne middle East haa ling term visas covering flights into India. This attitude hu.s throughout been the handicap of Iranian Airways.

At the request of the Shah and although the dual Hurricanes have n#t yet arrived, about six officer pilots of the Air Force have nd\r fl«vm the Hurricanes. Ving Commander Gibbs of the Hawker Team, was not over anxious to allow them to go solo before having had dual, but it was •bviousiy difficult to hold cut against the Persians when eight Hurricanes have already been test flown. ‘,/ing Commander Gibbs therefore, had one Hurricane jacked up and ran through the cockpit drill. On the first day there were no incidents except that one young pilot on nis first solo decided to shoot up the tarmac in tne presence of tne Shah and very nearly failed to recover from a very low roll. The following day the Commander designate of the Hurricane Squadron, Colonel Hoezzi, failed to ensure that the undercarriage green lights were on before selecting flaps down, and the undercarriage consequently collapsed on landing. The usual damage was done. This inoident has for the time being restrained the enthusiasts and the Head #f the Air Force ht s now tightened up *n the authorisation of flights. 2. The Shah is anxious to have at least seven Hurricanes wdth pilots rperrationally ready should they be needed in Azerbaijan. 3 .

The Hawker Team, with tne inefficient assistance of Persians, hope to produce one Hurricane every two days for air test. Two dual Hurricanes are believed to have sailed from tne United Kingdom on the 5th. December, and tne other two are to follow shortly after'wards. As previously reported two airscrews were damaged in a fire, one fuselage was damaged during uncrating, and one Hurricane was damaged wnen tx.e undercarriage collapsed on landing owing to faulty manipulation of the selector by a Persian pilot. 2. Tne Hawker Teams' main task of assembling the Hurricanes is being handicapped by the inefficient assistance of the so called iersian mechanics, and also by the Snah's recent request that seven Hurricanes oe made operationally serviceable at snort notice. This request nas resulted in tne complete stoppage of worK: on erection as all the Hawker Teams efforts nave been turned on to producing the operational aircraft. This step is not to tne advantage of HawKers as tneir contract for tne services of tne team only commences when ail th„ 34 Hurricanes have been assembled, test flown and handed over.

The lack cf a decision is due mainly to the minister of posts, Telegraphs and Telephones' preoccupation with more urgent problems cf improving communications tnroughout Persia. The Air Attache has,however, already a. t roacned tne Director cf the D.C.A., ana the 3.O.A.C. Station Superintendent for their views.. A meeting has non been arranged mth the minister of J .T.T., ’.hen it is hoped to obtain fuller information. The future cf this airline has a. direct influence on tae for.iction of Eagle Airlines which has been previously reported. If tae State Airline continues and is to be reecuipped, then it is thought that we would be mere inclined to give it first priority in the ~upi lying of Britisii aircraft and possibly British technicians which they must have to put the airline's operations on a sound basis. If ,ho\/ever, the airline is to be closed down taen we would not be harming their operation by supplying aircraft and technicians to a priva/te venture such ss the Lagle Airlines. 9.

A recent instruction requires the B.O.A.C. Lodestars flying between Teheran and Baghdad and vice versa, to carry a full load of _etrol vnich cuts do-vn their passenger capacity from 10 to 4. As there are usually for each aircraft four through passengers for the united Kingdom or Yves tern Europe, these four seats are usually filled, but in some cases higher priority passe.gers for the piddle Last have to be included. it is obvious that this service is now even more uneconomical, although by continuing its operation tne way may be kept open for a .lore profitable service at a later date.

As reportod in last week’s Su.^iiary the Persian Army launched a general attach on the AZERBAIJAN Democrat forces on the morning of the - 10th# The Persian Army column advancing northwards of ZE1TJAN along the main road made rapid progress, and Hind aircraft based at ZENJAN gave valuable co-operation in reporting enemy positions and in bombing retreating transport. On the 11th. the Governor General of AZERBAIJAN telegraphed his submission, and by the 13th. the Persian Army column had arrived in TABRIZ. Military operations have been covered by the Military Attache’s signals. There appears to be no doubt that the entry *»f the Persian Army into AZERBAIJAN has met with the almost unanimous support of the AZERBAIJAN people and certainly the rest of Persia. By oa&amp;aining such an early victory the Russians have been robbed of any excuse or opportunity to assist the AZERBAIJAN forces. 2. The part played by the Air Force has given groat satisfaction to the Army Commanders and especially to the Shah, and it is hoped that more attention will now bo given to the dovelopomont of this arm. The lead of the Air Foroo lias already rocoived a provisional promise from the Shah that the Air Force’s budget for next yoar will bo increased. 3. By the 10th. whon the general attack was launched, tho Air Force had 10 Hinds and 2 Tiger Moths based at ZENJAN« The so aircraft, despite bad woather, provided information on enemy positions and movements as 'well as doing thoir share of bombing and ground strafing. One 'ind ran short of fuel and had to make a forced landing behind the enemies lines, out it is hoped that this aircraft will eventually be salvaged* On the morning of the 11th. two Hurricanes, fitted with overload tanks, took off from Tehoran and shot up retreating transport on the main road north of MIANEH. They returned to Teheran safoly. By tho 15th. 7 Hinds had arrived in TABRIZ where they are temporarily based. As mopping up operations continue detachments will probably move forward with the Amy whore airfields are fit. 4. On tho 13 th. the Shall flow to ZEN JAN where he inspected the Army and Air Force units. He returned tho same day. 5 . In para. 3 of last week’s Summary it was stated that an Anson had made a sortie over TABRIZ dropping leaflets. It is now learnt that this flight was made by an Expeditor. There are rnly two Expeditors in Persia, tho Shah’s and tho American Air Attache’s. It is thought that as the Shah’s pilot is abroad, the American Air Attache flew tho Shah’s aircraft on this flight. It is also thought that he took photographs of enemy positions which woro made asrliable to tho Persian Army* Page No. 2/— 2 •* PERSIAN AIK FORCE CONT INUED . S** 6 . The position as reported in para. 2 of last week* s Summary concorning the hawker team is now alleviated as the urgency for producing operational aircraft no longer exists. 7fing Commandor Gibbs and the Air Attache are now pressing tho Ministry of War to accept February 1st. as the date upon which tho Hawker contract will commence. This should bo acceptable to both parties and should solve tho hawker toams*• difficulties. Although urgent ruquosts were made to flight deliver tho four dual Hurricanes from tho United Kingdom it was too late to prevent tho first two from being do spate hod by soa as all arrangements had already been made. At present tho Air Ministry and Hawkers are investigating the possibilities of flight delivering tho remaining two although tho bad weather along the routo and also the fact that the aircraft aro not fitted with p/T may make this impracticable. 7. Tho Hoad of tho Air Force has stated his intention of acquiring 60 Harvards as well as 30 medium bombers. To round off his ro-equipment programme ho would like a further 30 fighters and it is believed that when Hr. Lloyd of Hawkers was in Tohoran tho Hoad of the Air Force asked whether it was possible to supply a further 30 Hurricanes, but IIB*s fitted with 3 machine guns. 8 . It is interesting to note that tho Amorloan state Department has denied the report broadcast by Moscow radio that tho American Government has supplied 40 bombers to tho Iranian Gove mmont. 9. Tho Anti Aircraft equipment of tho Persian Army consists of 16 by 75 m/m Bofors and 63 by 15 ir/m single machine guns. Of tho latter only 36 are in service. From time to time anti aircraft firing is practiced by 75 ir/m units for which an Audax tows a drogue. Tho only'airfield with permanent anti aircraft defences at the moment appears to bo QUALEII M0RGHEH (Tohoran), whoro there is a Battery of 3 75 ir/m Bofors and 3 15 n/m single machine guns. The Battery is sited on the airfield. 10. On the 9th Deco ber tho Embassy received a note from tho Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that owing to the state of emergency in AZERBAIJAN, flights of all Foreign aircraft wore banned in that area until further notice. It is believed that oven the Russian civil air service between TEHERAN and TABRIZ was prevented from operating. 11. On tho 14th. the Air Attache visited tho Persian Air Force airfield at QtlALEK M0RGHEH to inspect tho Hurricanes. Ho was mot by COLONEL M0EZZI, Commanding Officer of tho Hurricane unit and by Wing Commandor Gibbs. 12 Hurricanes have now been test flown and work is proceeding satisfactorily on tho others. Ning Commander Gibbs has been asked by tho Hoad of the Air Force to prepare 10 Hurricanes for a victory Fly past which ho has boon asked to load. In his capacity as instructor to the Air Foroo ho is justified in doing so. Pago.3/PEKS3M CP/IL AY LOTION - 3 DEPARTMENT O F CI VIL A Y LI T ION &gt; 12. Tho Embassy has rocoivod a noto from, tho Porsian Ministry of Foreign Affairs renewing, as from tho 15th for throe months, 3*0JuC 1 a permission to operate their services. At tho smae time the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses tho hope that during this' period a definite air agreement will bo concluded between H»K. Government and tho l-orsian Government. 13. Mr. Chafik, Director of the Civil Aviation Department has had a mooting with tho Air Attache and Sir Jlaromont Skrino, the Government of India Counsellor to this Embassy, to prepare the ground for an air agreement between India and Persia. Mr, Chafik is very hopeful of tho future of Persia through which air services from tho Far East will operate. Ho is thinking in terms of a revival of tho old caravan route but in the modern guise of air transport. IRANIAN STA TE A IRL INE. 14. Further to para ,8 of last week* s Summary the Air Attache had a mooting with Mr. NIKPAY, the Minister of Posts, Tolographs and Tolephonos. Tho latter was fully av/are of tho present state of tho airline and tho urgent necessity to rc-organiso both tho managerial and operational side. Ho stated that although ho had boon aware of tho present state of affairs for soma time his other duties had prevented him from giving tho matter attention. Ho admitted that apart from political considerations his own belief was that tho airline would never bo a financial success und^r Government control. Tho Air Attache pointed out that with tho imminent formation of Eagle Airlines, wo were faced with tho problem of giving assistance to this new vnturo, possibly to tho dotrimont of the State Airline, and that as long as tho Stato Airline existed v/o felt that it should hvo first priority. MR. NIKPAY undertook to raise the matter with tho Prime Minister at an early date, and ho thought that as tho continuance of tho Stato Airline would involve ro-cquipmont and complete ro-organisation, that tho chances were that it would be disbanded subject to any political conditions.

The first aircraft is due to arrive at London Airport on Thursday 26th. 11- It is rumoured that the Company intends to acquire two Skymasters for long distance services to America.

During the year the Democrats were in control of AZERBAIJAN, three Iranian Officers deserted to TABRIZ, and assisted by the Russians, they started pilot instruction for a number *f young AZERBAIJANIES. Subsequently one officer was killed and the wther two have disappeared. At the same time a certain number of officers stationed in Teheran, flew to TABRIZ frwm time to time using the Russian civil airline, and there premised assistance to PISHAVAR I should he ever require it. This dealing with the enemy was known to the Head of the Air Force, who took pains to send the officers concerned to distant southerly parts of Persia, when the reoent AZERBAIJAN crisis developed. The Head of the Air Force has row- sent his deputy, COLONEL GUILIANSHAH and two otner officers to AZERBAIJAN to obtain evidence against these would be traitors. '/hen the investigating party returns from AZERBAIJAN the General expects to be in a position to maxe arrests. Erection of the Hurricanes continues satisfactorily. Nine are now operationally serviceable and a further seven have been test flown but'not yet fitted with armament or drop tanks. The Shah is eager to fly this aircraft, and he can hardly be restrained from doing so before trie dual Hurricanes arrive. To date, he has confined himself to taxying and cockpit familiarisation, but tne Head of tne Air Force is in a constant state of anxiety whenever the Snan goes near one of these aircraft. 4 . Tne Head of the Air Force has asked tne Air Attache to. obtain the price and delivery dates for thirty Hawker Fury’s. This request is a very tentative nibble at the purchase of modern fighters. LT.

The nangars, barrack blocks and other administrative buildings were put up by the Ministry of War and until the Civil Aviation Department can agree to some compensation, the Air Force is unwilling to agree to tne transfer. With the sum they hope to get as compensation for the loss of these buildings, the Air Force intends to build ruravays at the 3ASHGAR airfield which is now being used by tne TEHERAN AERO CLUB. The Air Force hopes to base a fighter regiment there. Unfortunately this dual control of Mehrabad handicaps the Civil Aviation Department from carrying out extensions to taxying tracks and setting up a purely civil administration. 11. Mr. Chafik, Director of the Department, confirmed that there had been exploratory conversations with the Afghans concerning the possible reciprocal services between tne two countries. The British Legation, Kabul, reports that the Afghans are considering the establishment of a T.W.A. assisted Afghan airline similar to Iranian . Airways, IRANIAN STAT E AIRLINE^ 12. This airline is still functioning erratically to Baghdad and to Meshed. Its aircraft also undertake special flights, the most common of v/hich are to R.A.F. Station, Habbaniya, to collect spares for the Air Force. Owing to preoccupation with the Elections no decision has yet been reached on the question of the future of this airline. IRANIAN AIR7 /AYS COMP ANY. 13. After their first and only flight to TABRIZ with Government Officials, the aircraft of this airline have not yet fulfilled their promise of establishing a regular service.- 3 - f IMNIAN MH-TAYS CavD PAl^. (CONTINU ED). 14. H.M. Government has agreed to the forl4ftghtly service TEHERAN/LONDGN/TEIiERilN provided B.O.A.C. are afforded the normal custons privileges for equipment imported into Persia to operate B.O.A.C. services. To date enumerable wrangles have taken place over B.O.A.C. equipment. The latest concerned a radio beacon imported by B.O.A.C. for the use of civil e.viation in general, for which the Persians attempted to charge Customs duty equivalent to the value of the equipment. 15* Shortage of maintenance personnel is still acute. Whilst no serious failures in airframes or engines hrve been reported numerous cases have been mentioned by travellers of ancillary equipment, such as radio and heating not functioning. In addition, it is understood tnat the Persians are now demanding a greater say in the operations of the Company and that they are principally responsible for the irregularity of the services as they often interrupt regular services to despatch aircraft to points ■\/ere traffic is offering. The general effect upon public opinion is naturally bad and very few people travel by preference in their aircraft. FOREIGN AIRLINES. 16. Bi-monthly Air Trance service continues to operate. B,Q .A • C_._ 17. As previously reported the weekly B.O.A.C. shuttle service Teheran/Baghdad/Lydda and return was suspended, but almost immediately a weekly service Teheran/Baghdad/Teheran on Monday 1 s was introduced. According to B.O.A.C. this service is primarily intended to clear back-logs of air freight at Baghdad and Teheran, although in practice passengers ere rlso carried. There has been no relaxation in the B.O.A.C. instruction requiring their aircraft operating between Baghdad and Teheran and vice versa, to carry full petrol load which cuts down passenger capacity to four. This, despite the recommendations of Captains of aircraft and the assuronces of the Air Attache and tne B.O.A.C. Station Superintendent, that weather and radio facilities were adequate along the route. RUSSIAN. Russian services have recommenced TEHERAN/TABRIZ and tnei~ TEHERAN/MESHED service is still operating. 19 . Qn tne 3rd of January a special Soviet Dakota arrived in Teheran from Moscow on its way to Delhi, carrying a party of Soviet Scientists. The Air Attache had repared a full briefing for this aircraft instructing it to proceed to Habbaniya where onward briefing would be given for the remainder of tne route. ^Despite tne fact that the crew were informed that reliable information was not available concerning tne facilities at the R.A.F. Station, Shaibah (near Basrah), the Russian Captain of aircraft cnose to fly direct to this station on the 4 th in the face of an adverse weatner report and using the wrong W/T callsign. It is not surprising therefore, that he was unable to work Snaibah P/T satisfactorily or that his arrival was unexpected. The criticism he subsequently levelled at tiie R.xi..F. is typical of nis type. TI&amp;Lb Embassy, in a note to the Soviet Embassy in Teheran stated the above ^acts and made it quite clear that we accepted no responsibility for any difficulties the pilot of tne aircraft had experience*! by ignoring tne advice and instructions given to him at Teheran. Page. 4./- 4 - FOR EIGN AI RLINES (CONT INUED). RUSSIAN C ONTINUED. 20. It is interesting to note demanded through the British Air Attache in Moscow, two sets of maps for the stage Teheran to Dehli. These were not availrble in Teheran, and that was one of the reasons for despatching the aircraft to Habbaniya, but when the pilot decided to fly direct tc Shaibah, he produced extremely good Russian maps covering the entire route. :&gt;1. J trie Russians had SV/EDISH, 21. Although the A.B.A. Skyinaster to Teheran is nominally once monthly, the last aircraft arrived in Teheran on the 11th of January scarcely three weeks after its previous visit. Tnis aircra.ft is a forty seater, anu the Air Attache learnt from one of the passengers who flew in it from Rome that the stage Rome to Ankara was flown with 12 passengers, Ankara to Baghdad with 10, and Baghdad to Teiieran with 6 . The pilots claim that this is due to bad booking by their agents at the various stopping places. In addition tne passenger reported when landing at Ankara the entire airfield was covered by about lo” of snow, and tnat no attempt to define or clear runways nad been made. The aircraft landed but ran off the runway and must have been subjected to a severe strain ploughing througn mud and snow. GENERAL. 22. The Air Attache's aircraft was delivered to No. 134 M.U. on tne 2nd of January for a Major overhaul. On tne 9th. a Ventura from Communication flight at Habbaniya flew to Teheran with 20 bags of Diplomatic mail and 1600 lbs of spares for tne Air Attache's aircraft. It returned to Habbaniya the same day. 23 . Furtner to para.2. of Summary No. 35* Mr. Richrrd Wyndham, Newsof tne World correspondent, left Teheran in his Auster on the 24th December, nignt stopped at Kev mans hah and proceeded the following day to Baghdad. 24. The Shah's aircraft has undergone a minor inspection, but he test flew' it on the 9 th. and on the 10 th started off for Ahwaz but turned back half way owing to bad weatner along the mountains, and instead paid a visit to IRAQ (SULTANABAD). After making a tour of the tor:n he returned to Teheran. Capt. Pourdjowhari is now his personal pilot although the Shah does most of the 1 lying himself. DISTRIBUTION; - MR MINISTRY. 3 HQ. MED/ME. 3.

Flying training is limited for tne time being to formation flying and familiarisation in handling the aircraft. Some 500 cases of Hurricanes spares have arrived and disregarding advice the Persians have now succeeded in getting them into sucn a hopeless muddle tnat notning can be found. 3 . Of late a great deal of interest has centred around the aircraft factory at Loshan Tappeh. The Air Force hope to revive it as stated in previous summaries but now the Civil Aviation Department is considering it as a centre for the overhaul and inspection of civil aircraft operating in Persia. i f . it is learnt that the Americans are prepared to grant Persia a substantial, loan for tne purchase of equipment for her Armed Forces. Whether this would include airoraft is not known, but at present there is disagreement over terms and the control of purchases. 5 . The Head of the Air Force has of late shown interest in parachute troops and the Air Attache arranged an informal meeting with Mr. Kellas, Second Secretary, British Embassy v/ho had considerable experience as a parachute officer during the war. The Head of the Air Force has some vague notion of training his pilots and observers in parachuting should it ever be necessary to give this type of support to encircled ground forces. He was advised to send some of his officers abroad on training visits to bring them up to date before considering the establishment of such a force. PERS IAN CIVIL A VIAT ION.

As from the 1st January, 1947 this Department has assumed responsibility for the payment of tne salaries of the ten locally employed meteorological observers originally employed by the R.A.F. and attacned to the Embassy in Teheran and our Consulates at Isfahan, Kermanshah and Hamadan. Unfortunately the Department has not the authority to draw up contracts with these observers until the beginning of the Persian New Year on the 21st March, 1947. Until that date therefore they will continue to be administered by the R.A.F. H.M. Government has agreed to a weekly air service to Lydda. operated by Iranian Airways provided that Palestinian airlines will be granted similar facilities to Teheran should they ever desire them. / 2 .

The fortnightly service to Beirut has been extended to lydda. 10. Two more I-'airchild C61A have been acquired. Their registration letters are EP-AAQ and PP-AAS. 11. Infrequent flights are being made to Tabriz although it is understood that the Russian Meteorological Service at Mehrabal Airport (Teheran) is not being overhelpful in supplying weather forecasts which precludes a. regular service being established. EAGLE AIRLINES. 12. This projected airline is having difficulty in obtaining aircraft and foreign assistance to operale them. One of the Directors, Mr. Madon, aow in the United Kingdom is apparently discouraged by the long waiting lists for postwar British feeder line aircraft. The Directors are unable to decide how to commence operating during tne interim period while waiting for delivery of modern aircraft. FOREIGN AIRLINES. B.O.A.C. 13 . On the 18th and 25 th two special Dakotas arrived from Cairo with gold bullion for tne Persian Government. 14 . The French C-overnment now refuses to issue transit visas for France unless written application has been referred to Paris. This aoes not apply to holders of British passports but tne delay in obtaining visas for Persians will create an awkward backlog of Persians for the U.K. RUSSIAN. 15 . it is stated tnat the Russians are not: operating from Teheran to Tabriz as tney ere still a trifle unpopular there. 16. The Director of the Department of Civil Aviation informed the Air Attache that tne Russians are continually evading the payment of landing fees, hang or age, and other duties at Mehrnbnd Airport. He would like to be firm with them but knows tnat at the present time the Government would not support him. CZECH AIRLINES. 17 . On the 18th a special flight arrived from Prague of a Dakota aircraft (OK-HDL) of Czecho Levantska Airlines carrying drugs. The route was Prague, Istanbul, Lydda, Baghdad, Teheran.

At the moment the Persians nope tnat tnis will also apply to tne Officers tney intend to send to tne U.S.A. Tne Russian and Britisn practice is to levy charges for all Courses, and while tne xersians are not over interested in sending Officers to Russia tney have intimated on more tnan one occasion tnat the British practice may preclude them from sending officers to tne U.K. The eagerness of some officers to get out of iersia for even a sxiort while is evident from tne fact tnat many of tnem are prepared to pay all tne expenses connected with foreign Courses including travelling and ip many cases the expense of taking their entire families with them. 8 . On the 23rd. the Air Attacne inspected the new premises of the Plying Training School at Doshan ^Epp'eh. These are not yet completed and the Head of tne Air Force is now busy finding the necessary training equipment and more especially up-to-date text books.

The points he raised were of a general nature dealing with training, meteorology, the control of airfields, and finally his visit to CANADA in Lay to attend the International Air Conference. He stated that arrangements had already been made with tne Americans for him to visit military establishinents in the U.3.A. after the conference. He enquired whether it would be possible to arrange a similar series of visits in England. A. Tne Air Attache visited the Heaaqusrters of the Persian Air Force on tre 16th. and discussed witn General Amidi various matters connecteu with tue supply of equipment to the Persian Air Force. 3 .

Travellers have repeatedly statea that they have little fault to find .vitn the actual flying of tns aircraft, but tne slight regard paid to passenger comfort and convenience has given tnis airline a o&amp;d ns^ne throughout trie ill dale East. This might well reflect unfavourably upon any other j ersian airline v/nicn may couie into being ; and on these grounds the Director considered trut he would have to take immediate action. &lt; 2 # The American Ambassador informed the Air Attache that radio equipment installed and held at A3ADA' airfield to tne value of 80,000 dollars han be&lt;-n given to the Persians, after they had agreed to buy tne American fixed assets at ABADAN airfield. This radio equipment was necessary for the operating of Iranian Airways services and had been given to tne j^rsians on the understanding that they were capable of operating and maintaining it. The Anerican Ambassador remarked tna.t he knew full ’well tnat the Persianswere incapable of this but that at the time tnere had been no other way to deal witn the matter. I RANIAN aIR./A Yo COMPANY. 10. Numbers of wild rumours have been circulating concerning administrative difficulties of this airline. Although not entirely unfounded there is apparently no immediate prospect of a pilot strike or the cessation of tneir operations. The American Ambassador stated in confidence tnat in addition to the 500,000 dollars for aircraft and other equipment tne Company was already nearly 4-00,000 dollars down on current operationo. One of tie ma-^or overhead expenses was tnat of tne salaries of the pilots who receive 800 dollars a month and all found. Commander Dowker, at one time their operations manager has left tne Company, ana it is learnt tnat Colonel Prouty, tneir Administrative Manager is also shortly due to leave. It is farcier stated tnat T. .A. is to send a Commision Enquiry to investigate tne Company’s position.

Mr. Bamfield, the Cotnmercial Manager of this airline has visited feneran and. has obtained peruiission for Iraqi air\7ays to operate a once v/eexcly Dakota service from Baghdad to Teneran. The first service 'will commence on tne 31st iiarch ana tee snuttle flignt v/ill be done in one day. SOVIET AIRLINES . 13. On the 20tn a special Soviet Dakota arrived from Moscow carrying Soviet Delegates to tne Inter-Asian Relations Conference at Dehli. Altnough tne Soviet Embassy and tne Lersia Department of Civil Aviation had been informed by the Air Attachetnat, as this was a civil aircrait and as it was understood that it was to f]y via Baghdad and Basrah there was no neea for tne Air Attache to issue a briefing for the aircraft's on./ard flignt. Despite this fact the Russians made no attempt to contact the Persians, and at a late hour of tne evening prior to their departure for Basrah, the Russians approached tne Air Attache for tbe necessary information. Owing to the lateness of the hour and to the fact that as the following day was a Persian holiday and no responsible iersian would be available to assist tne Russians, the Air Attache provided them with all the information they required ana despatched a telegram to Bagndad and nasrah warning them 01 the aircraft's flight plan. It has since been pointed out to tne Russians that by not contacting the responsible Persian Air Authorities, the Air Attrcne v/as placed in the invidious position of accepting responsibility for the bneling of a civil aircraft, which, by rights should nave been the task of the Persians. As the Russians on a previous occasion paid little attention to tne Air Attache's briefing ana they had the temerity to complain after they haa landed unneralded at Shaibah, it is to be hoped that future flights ''./ill be dealt with entirely by the appropriate Civil Aviation Atnorities in the countries through which tne aircraft passes. The present tendency oi the Russians to rely upon the British whenever they fly outside tne U.o.S.R is merely a continuance of - war-time procedure ana tne sooner it is discontinued the sooner local Aviation Athorities will feel that we are not taking upon ourselves a function which is rightfully tneirs.

In his speech he also relerreu to a national meteorolo 0 ical service which ■'would benefit agriculture and civil and military aviation. 3 . The Shah continues to fly regularly in the Hurricanes and in fact taxes every opportunity to fly anythin^ with wings on it. v/hen tie 'weather is unfit for Hurricanes he occasionally practices instrument flying in an Anson.

Patterson who is returning to the United Kingdom for compassionate reasons. On tne 30th. two more members of the team arrived bringing t.e total to seven. There is still a certain amount of friction inside tne team concerning the question of contracts, administrative control ana pay.

Another subject dealt witn by tne Iriuie minister in his Y.e'j Year si^eecn, was the developement of civil aviation in lersia. He uientioned the need to construct more airfields and he made reference to airlines 'supported by the Government'. The implication oi this statement is not clear but the .[inister oi P.T.f. in conversation with the Air Attache stated that no decision had yet been reached concerning the future of trie State Airline. IRANIAN AIR AYS COIL . ANY. 8 . In conversation witn a South African pilot employed by this Company, the Air Attache -,/as given tne following picture of tne internal position of this airline. The pilot understood that the Persians had now bought the aircraft and equipment and that they were severing their connection with T.,..A. T.W.A. on tneir side were withdrawing their representatives including pilots and ground staff. Owing to the uncertainty of obtaining lucrative employment in the U.S.A. some of trie pilots ana ground staff haa electea to remain under contract to the Persians. Great efforts //ere being made to engage qualifiea -pilots of any nationality. Tne intention appeared to be to continue operations. This pilot haa inaugurated a Fairchila daily service between BASRAH,- ABADAN, BUSHIRE and SHIRAZ. He claimed t.iat the two Fairchilds operating this service were based at BASRAH, but t.ie Director of the Department of Civil Aviation maintains that they are based at AH.AZ. As far as can be gathered the above facts are substantially correct ana at the present moment the airline is attempting to keep four DaKotas serviceable v/icn which they operate ad hoc services. Their advertised services should therefore not be relied upon. It is difficult to reconcile the Persians decision to continue operations .men it is common Knowledge that they are alreaay a quarter oi a million dollars aown on current operations. In addition there is a rumour t.iat one of tne Directors nas been attempting to get rid oi his snares but without success. In this connection it may well be that tne Prime Minister's passing reference to 'Government support' has taken concrete form in financial assistance to this airline which can justifi ably claim that their present losses are largely due to inefficient management by T. .A. and to the complete lack of discipline of the American Captains' of aircraft.- 3 - EXT ■it FjJRSIAN CIVIL AVI ATION (COMTI MjED) .

The pros ana cons of chartering as opposed to the direct purchse of aircrai t are not known, but if tne terms of chartering are too severe and lead to an appreciable loss on the first year's operations, this fact may discourage the Persians.

Prom the 4th. to the 15th. the Air Attache, accompanied by the Assistant British military Attache and Plight Serge;nt Pryor of the Air Attache’s staff, toured AZERBAIJAN by car. Separate reports are being prev&gt;ared covering in detail the operations of the Persian Air Force against the BARZANI tribes and also of the survey of AZERBAIJAN airfields. 2. As mentioned in paragraph 1 of tne last Summary the Hind flight previously stationed at TABRIZ had been moved to REZAIEri to operate against the BARZANI3. 3 . At the invitation of LAJCR GENERAL HlLiAINI, the Air Attache made two sorties as a passenger in Hinds on the 8 th. In the morning piloted by LIEUTENANT i’LOEBI, a 2^ hour flight was made during which dive bombing ana machine gunning of BARZANIS 'was carried out. The flight also covered the entire area over which fighting had taken place and the extremely mountainous nature of the country afforded ample confirmation of the value of even a small amount of air support to the Army. In the afternoon, piloted by LIEUTENANT FARHANG, a two hour flight was made mainly to the area where the IRAQI, TURXISH, and PERSIAN frontiers meet. By this time it was evident that the BARZANIS were in full retreat towards the IRAQI frontier and no further bombing was carried -out although a small amount of ground strafing, had been ordered to harry the lagging elements of the BARZANIS. g. The BARZANIS have been comparatively well armea and several aircraft have been hit by automatic fire during dive bombing and ground strafing. During the operations one Hind caught fire in the air. The pilot was killed in the subsequent crash but the observer managed to escape by parachute. Two other observers were wounded in the legs but they are reported to be recovering. A further Hind aircraft forced landed through lack of petrol 'without injury to the pilot. This aircraft was salvaged and spares were on their way by road from TABRIZ. The Air Attache was favourably impressed by the standard of flying, maintenance, discipline and ground organisation of the Persian Air Force detachment at REZAIEH. 5 . On the 4th. of April, CAPTAIN POURJO HARI, the Shah's personal pilot killed himself and wrote r off a Tiger Moth 'while executing aerobatics in the vicinity of TEHRAN. No structural failure of the aircraft is suspecte^xna the cause of his acciaent would appear to be the old story of aCrobatting at too low an altituae and failing to come out of a dive. 6 , On the 21st.

They have now agreed to supply one administrative cum tecnnical manager and only five pilots. Entire control v/ill be vested in the Iranian Board of Directors. Outstanding amounts o\/ing to T. ••A# fox maintenance and pilots salaries have been reduced to a figure agreeable to the Persians and part of tnis deot is being icot bj, the return of an unspecified number of Dakotas. From tne point of view of the Persians they are now working only Dakotas and are holding nine in reserve for cannibalisation as this is apparently the only means by which they can obtain spares with certainty. Foreign pilots are being engaged, preferably South African, or Polish, Britishers are preferred, hopes to obtain the airmail contract and the Managing Director MR. G-.H. EBTAHAJh is confident of the airline paying its 'way. after this reshuffle is completed. A side-li 0 ht to T. .A's visit to Persia is that •they have completed a very swift bit of business in selling their converted Fortress to H.I.M. The SHAH for 175,000 dollars. There is a little uncertainty concerning tne actual transaction but it is learnt on good authority that the Prime Minister paid for the aircraft as a personal gift to the ShaJa. It is doubtful, however, •whether the Shah realises this aspect of the deal. Altnough tne fuselage is that of a flying Fottress it is understood that the^ aircraft was one of the last to come off the production line and was converted for T. ; .A. as an executive aircraft before any military equipment had been installed.

It is ' understood that, at his mother's request, one of the religious leaders in Tehran asked the Snah to be more careful. The immediate result was that the Shah did not fly the Hurricanes for about three v/eeks, but he broke this spell on the 20 th. by flying from QUALEK MORGHEH to ivEHRABAD AIRPORT, TEHRAN to see the Bristol Freighter demonstration. 19 , On the 10th of April a U.S. Army Air Transport Command Dakota made an extensive flight over AZERBAIJAN \ritn a party of Persian Gendarmerie and their American Advisors on bocTd.

Owing to bad weather in the lAHRIZ area the pilot lost himself and eventually forced landed near NAKCHEVAN in SOVIET AZERBAIJAN. The Russians confined the pilot to a room for over a y/eek, and cross questioned him concerning the strength and equipment of the Persian Air Force. Eventually, after representations had been made by the lersian Government to the Russians, tNe pilot was permitted to fly back to TABRIZ. Three Persian Air Force Tiger Moths have been on loan to tne Department of Agriculture to aid them in their anti- Locust campaign in the area N.V. of SULTANABAD. 7« Recently five Ansons completed the first of a series of navigational exercises which included visits to ISFAHAN, AH AZ, KERlIANSHAH , and HAMAD AN.

On the 26th. the Air Attache had a meeting with the Chief of General Staff. The latter enquired about the Air Force's efficiency during the operations against the BARZANI3. The major shortcoming of the pilots was their obvious lack of practice in bombing and air firing, but it is hoped that in tne coming year more attention will be given to this side of flying traning. PERSIAN CIV IL AVIATION. CIVIL AVIAT ION DEPARTMENT. 9 . The Russians are again pressing the jpfijgjj-an Government for the establishment of an Irano-Soviet airline t t 0 / have exclusive landing rights in northern Persia, extending* rror TABRIZ to MESHED, and on terms which would give tne Russians complete control of the airline and a monopoly of air services in tnat area. Local newspapers have commented on this unfavourably, and have dram attention to the existing Russian air services operating between TEKERAN/TABRIZ and TEHERAN/MESHED which have never received any official sanction. 10 . As reported in paragraph 17 of Summary No. 8/47, the Russians had refused to pay repeated claims by the Persian Department of Civil Aviation for landing fees and hangarage. H.M. Vice Consul at TABRIZ reported that the Russian service from TEHERAN to TABRIZ was grounded on May 4th, and it is now learnt that as a result of this step the Russians have made a part payment in regard to the claims mentioned above. n ,- • The Persian Government has agreed to the proposed terms for reciprocal services v/ith the Government of India. To start with there will probably be a once weekly service by Iranian Airways and an Indian Airline between TEHERAN and DELHI via the Persian Gulf. f 12. It is learnt from BAGHDAD that TATA-, airline y ^ recently completed a survey flight to BAGHDAD, and that a greeme nt ^ liad been reached for the establishment of reciprocal services between J?' } BAGlSA^anantARACHI.

This would appear to be a deliberate step to take -passengers from these two airlines. The airline is also operating thrice weekly to TABRIZ on the same days as the Russian service. At the moment the Department of Civil Aviation appears to be incapable of persuading Iranian Airways to come to any agreement \/ith other airlines for a more equitable distribution of* services.d 4 GENERAL. On the 25th, the American Air Attache a months leave in the U.3.A. On the 29 th. he left for returned two day's later. - 15 # Recently an American Army Transport Command Dakota B.3. landed at ABADAN from DHAKRAN. Although, in the past, these aircraft have been flying from DHAHRAN and CAIRO to TnHERAN on an average of once a week, usually with' little attempt to obtain prior consent from the Persians, this aircraft was grounded at ABADAN until the necessary clearance had been obtain from TEHERAN. This action was no doubt a result of the recent tightening up on the movements of foreign aircraft in Persia, and also the movements of service Attaches and Foreign Military Advisors to the Persian Government.

Instructions haw been given to the Air Force to prepare as many Hurricanes as possible for flignt to TABRIZ in tne near future. This is presumed to be in connection with K.I.H. THE SHAH'S proposed visit to AZjJYuaIJAN. H.I.H. THE SHAH is due to leave TEHERAN on tne 24th of Hay by rail ana it is his intention to make a tour of AZERBAIJAN lasting two or three weeks. The Hurricanes are -no doubt required to take part in a big military parade to be held in TABRIZ during the SHAH'S visit. 3 . In conversed ion with Y/ING COi/L ANBER GIBBS, H. I.M. THE SHAH stated that he would always prefer to recommend the purchase of iti-sh aircraft for tne Persian Air Force but that o\n.ng to lacn of funds his country was obliged to take advantage of the type of credit granted by the Americans and also of their offer of war surplus aircraft at very reduced prices. He quoted a price of £1,000 for Mustangs. The Air Attache has s^nce pointed out to the Air Force that unless approval is obtained from H.M. Government, Mustangs will not be fitted witn Rolls Royce engines. H.I.M. THE SHAH had heard of the re-equipping of the Turkish Air Force with war surplus Spitfires and Mosquitos, ana he is particularly interested in the latter, a film of which is shortly to be shown to him by the Air Attache. It is thought, however, that even £12,000 for a reconditioned Mosquito is too much for the Persian Government, 4 . On tte 12th. GROUP CAPTAIN STOKES of Rolls Royce and WING COM AIDER BR0FN' of Percival Aircraft arrived in TEHERAN. The latter owing to bad weather had to leave his Proctor at BAGHDAD. During their five day visit to TEHERAN meetings with the Persian Air Force, the Director of Civil Aviation, and local business men were arranged for these two representatives. GROUP CAPTAIN STOKES stated that he was \rell satisfied with the work which the Rolls Royce representative on the Hawker team had been able to acnieve under tne difficulties of snortage of erecting equipment for tne Hurricanes and tne absence of skilled mechanics to assist m tne maintenance, (TNG 00. BANDER BROWN has impressed the Persian Air 1 orce with possibilities of the Percival Prentice as a basic trainer to replace their Tiger Moths, and with tne percival prince as a V.I.P. aircraft or for use with Eagle Airlines.

DEPARTMENT OF C IVIL AVIATION. 7. In conversation v/ithothe Air Attache, Mr. Chafik, Director of the Department of Civil Aviation, stated that the Cabinet had only approved of a budget for his department of £ 20,000 for the forthcoming year. Mr. Chafik stated that he nad asked for approximately 2 million pounds to cover urgently required 'work on airfields, radio and meteorological facilities. The sum of £ 20 , 000 , if not increased, would barely, be sufficient to keep the present facilities operating. If no increase in his budget is forthcoming, then it is difficult to see how the Civil Aviation Department can possibly carry out any developments and there is therefore little hopj of early improvement in the present poor radio or meteorological facilities. IRANIA N AIRWAYS. 8 . This airline is now operating its external services fairly regularly, but owing to shortage of maintenance personnel the internal services are extremely irregular. The Managing Director, MR. EBTAKAJ, informed the Air Attache that the airline was fast running short of dollars to pay the agreed portion of the American pilots and maintenance crews salaries. He . • stated that on his recent visit to London he had concluded negotiations vrith Polish army representatives there for the supply of Polish aircrews, but that difficulties had now arisen concerning their passorts. He had subsequently informed tne Polish army authorities in London that he could only employ Poles who had accepted British nationality, and this point is now proving a stumbling bl He. He is also trying to secure South African pilots. As recently there has been so much public criticism of America's growing influence in tne economic life of Persia, he is anxious to avoid engaging more American pilots. The fares of this airline for the se,vices to BAGHDAD&gt; BEIRUT and CAIRO have been recently put up to figures only a few pounds below those of B.C.A. C. The fare to PARIS which four .months ago was about £150 has now been reduced to £100. The weekly TEHERAN- PARI3 aircraft is always fully booked. EAGLE AIRLINE S. 9. MR SHAHIDI, Managing Director of this proposed airline, recently heard from MR. MAD0N in LONDON, that negotiations were progressing satisfactorily with B.O.A.C. for the hiring of a small number of Consuls to.'other with ground and aircrews. Although this airline originally intended to secure Doves, they are now very interested in the Percival Prince, FOREIGN AIRLINES . RUSSI AN AIRLINES. 10. Further to para. 10 of Summary No. 9/4-7 } the Russian services between TEHER, H - TABRIZ and TEHERAN - MESHED are once again operating regularly.

It is rumoured that he will be replaced by COLONEL STODAKH who is now attending the R.A.F. Staff College Course in England. 2. Further to paragraph 2 of Summary No. 10/47 &gt; H.I.M, THE SHAH left TEHERAN on the 24th for a 2-3 weeks t-our of AZERBAIJAN He v/as accompanied by a large entourage in which was incluaed COLONEL GUILANSHAH, Chief of Staff of the Air Foroe. Although it was originally intended to send as many Hurricanes as possible to TABRIZ, maintenance difficulties fortunately prevented this massed flight. Eventually orly two Hurricanes flew to TABRIZ and they have since returned, 3* On the 20th. May, the Air Attache was granted an Audience by H.I.LL THE SHAH. The Air Attache took the opportunity to discuss the re-equipping and manning of the Air Force* THE SHAH showed great interest in the Mosquito and expressed a desire to see the Mosquito film v/hich the Air Attache now has in Teheran. This excellent film portrays the development and operational use o£ remarks.ble British aircraft. 4* The SHAH once more mentioned the fact that owing to lacx of funds his country v/ould probably have to accept war surplus American aircraft v/hich v/ere be in: offered at very reduced figures. The Air Attache, ho’.ever, has since learnt that altnough American war surplus aircraft were offered at low prices several months a.^ 0 ^ the figures have now been substantially raised. The Air Attache has no confirmatic.: of tnis fact but if it is substantiated, then our prospects of selling Mosquitos to the 1'ersians are much brighter THE SHAH appeared to have taken the trouble to stw_y the performance figures of various British and American aircrcft, and his direct connection with the Persian Air Force and his preference for British aircraft v/ill undoubtedly be the deciding factor in the purenase of more aircraft. 5. CAPTAIN MALKER of DE HAVILLAND 1 3, who is to be their Middle East representative, arrived in TEHERAN on the 26th. He is well known in Persian Air Force circles, as from 1935 - 1937, he v/as in charge of their aircraft factory in TEHERAN. During his week's visit he met the Minister of ,/ar, the Director of the Department of Civil Aviation, the Head of the Air Force, and the Managing Director of the proposed Eagle Airlines. At the invitation of the Head of the Air Force, he inspected the aircraft factory and discussed the possibility of building light training aircraft. His visit v/as well timed as the Air Attache held an exhibition of photographs and films of civil and military aircraft, and CAPTAIN WALKER was able to give first hand information concerning his Company's aircraft.■Cp.o;e . 7 '/« - over. - 2 - PERSIAN AIR F ORCE (CONTINUED) . 6 , On the 29 th. t 3 Air Attache showed two films to officers of the Air Force ac the Officers' Club.

B.O.A.C. assisted throughout and a special B.O.A.C. crew was laid on to assist at the exhibition by explaining any points connected with British Airways and air routes. On the opening date invitations were extended to the Minister 01 ./ar, the CHief of General Staff, head of the Air Force, Senior Officers, Government Officials, Service Attaches, members of the local press, and important business men. The opportunity v/xs also taken to show them the films mentioned above. Q, on the 31 st. some 200 officers of the Persian Air Force were invited and it is hoped to invite a similar number of Persian Air Force N.C.O's on the 2nd. of June. By arrangement with the British Embassy Information Department, the exhibition will be open to tne public from the ist. - pch. 01 june.

In discussion oith passengers who have travelled in their aircraft, the Air Attache has learnt that there is little improvement in their passenger handling facilities, and/th^' majority of their aircraft are still only fitted with bucket seats down both sides of the cabin, the public is hardly encouraged to fly in their aircraft. During the last two weeks they have acquired three more lease lend ex R.A.P. Dakotas for cannibalisation. The Air Attache was informed by a Mouth African pilot employea oy Iranian Air'.rays who had flown one of these aircrait from wairo to Teheran, that in many instances these aircra.ft were in better condition than those used for the airline's regular services. EXT 1289 I V*/ 12. During C/JTAIF /ALKER'S recent visit to Teheran he met MR. SHAHIDI, Managing Director of this airline, and as a result it is thought that this airline will now try to secure DOVES as originally intended. FOREIGN AIRLINES. RUSSIAN AIRLINES. 13. There is little fresh information available ana the Director of the Depart aent of Civil Aviation is reluctant to say anything about the future of its operations. He undoubtedly feels that their cabotage service between TEHERAN, MESHED and TABRIZ should be discontinued and if they wish to operate services to PERSIA at all, it should be under the same conditions as those operated by B.O.A.C. and other foreign airlines. GENERA L. 14. The American A.ir Attache has returned from a three weeks liaison visit to the American Zone in Germany.

The exhibition was mentioned in the last summary*. A, Full details concerning the availability of Mosquito F. B. VI aircraft have been given to H.Id. THE SHAH and the MINISTER OF PAR who are both extremal interested in this aircraft. 5 . The local newspapers have repoj. ed the formation of a Grand Council of Aviation to co-ordinate ax. military and civil aviation matters. The i'resident is to be the Inspector General of the Persian Air Force and members will be the Director of the Department of Civil Aviation, the Head of the Persian Air Force, one techr.ioal officer, and a legal advisor. The exact functions of this Council are not clear but if it can do anything to speed up the establishment of satisfactory radio facilities for aviation in Persia, then it will have everyone s blessijg. 6 * On the 15th, the British Military Attache and the Air Attache had a meeting with the MINISTER OF PAR and HEAD OF THE AIR FORCE. The Air Attache raised certain questions connected with the issue of maintenance equipment to the Hurricane Squadron. Although a large number of tools and maintenance equipment h..ve been received from England by the Persian Air Force they are extremely dilatory in unpacking the crates and in issuing urgently required tools and equipment to the Hurricane Squadron. The Military Attacne and the Air Attache took the opportunity to mention certain over lapping functions of MING CCivLLANDER GIBBS of the Hawker team and COLONEL ADAMS the American Advisor to the Persian Air Force. It is thought, however, that although over-lapping may have taken place in the past, the Persians, like ourselves and the Americans, are anxious to avoid any duplication of effort and nov/ that the functions of WING COIL-AIDER GIBBS and COLONEL ADAMS have been more clearly defined, they will be able to dove-tail their work.Page.3/ - 2 - PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATI ON.

During the recent operations against the Barzanis in N. 1 /. Persia, the Persian Air Force detachment at REZi^IEH made daily reconnaisance, bombing,and ground straffing sorties. During thi last phase of the fighting, two Hind aircraft landed on the old ■abandoned landing ground a few miles west of MAKU. No work has been done to improve this landing ground and now that the operations are ended it is not likely to be used again. Full details of sorties are not yet known, but no aircraft were lost. 2. On the 28th. the Air Attache made an aerial reconnaisance of all landing ground in AZERBAIJAN, and apart from the Persian Air Force detachment at PDZAJEH no other Persian,aircraft were seen. 3 . Flying and Ground training continues in the Hurricane Squadron.. On the 20th., when landing after an aerial exercise, a Hurricane's undercarriage collapsed resulting in damage to a wing tip, undercarriage, propellor and under-surface of the fuselage. Although the Persian pilot claimed that the undercarriage v..s locked down there is some doubt on this point. 4 . During the Shell's recent tour of AZERBAIJAN he flew a Hurricane from TABRIZ to REZAIEH and back again. On the 27th. the Shah made a flight in his converted Fortress from TEHSRnN to TABRIZ and RINA.

An interesting fact mentioned by Mr, EbtahaJ 'was that the three flights to Paris per month accounted for kQ/ 0 of the airline’s revenue. This is not surprising as their aircraft to Paris arc always fully booked both ways, while owing to poor servicability their internal services are irregular and consequently not relied upon by the travelling public. EACLE AIRLINES. 10. It is understood that negotiations are still taking place in London between B.O.A.C. and a representative of this airline. The airline’s licence to operate expired several waeks ngo but hes been renewed for a further period of four months. The Directors are becoming anxious lest the protracted negotiations carry on too long and some other airline steps in before they commence operating. It has not been suggested to B.O.A.C. that they send to Teheran a competent representative to enter into direct negotiations with the Directors and so attempt to crystalise the existing rather vague plans. 11. A Mr. Soldost, a Persian of Gterman/Russian parentage who was discovered by Reza Shah, developed the Persian tobacco monopoly and subsequently held various Government posts, recently approached the B.O.A.C. representative in Teheran and as^asd him to advise B.O.A.C, London not to conclude any agreement with Eagle , irlines until he had visited London and placed before them a plan for an airline, which, according to him, would be more attractive to B.O.A.C. Mr. Soldost is regarded as a capable but unscrupulous business man. To date he has been very uncommunicative concerning his airline, but he has stated that in his opinion Persia needs only one passenger airline and that a flying lorry service would stand a better chance of success than another passenger airline.FOREIGN AIRLINES.

C» Efforts are being made to increase Teheran's seats to the U.K. B.O.A.C. is rapidly losing both passengers and freight traffic to other airlines owing to the smell number of direct seats to the U.K. and also to the present necessity for demanding the payment of fares in sterling.

Cairo by their representative in Tehera.n* SWEDISH. 14 , The Swedish D.C.A, due in Teheran on the 20th* broke down at Baghdad and required a complete engine cnange. One of their Dakota aircraft flew a spare engine from Stockholm in 24^hours, but the aircraft was not ready to leave Baghdad for Sweden until the 26th.

On the 1st July, the Air Attache visited the Headquarters of the Persian Air Force and was informed by GENERAL /HIDI that H.I.H. THE SHAH had ^iven him instructions to approach the Minister of Par concerning funds for the purchase of a squadron of Hawker Fury's, a squadron of Mosquito F.B.VI's and four Bristol Freighters. The Head of the Air Force did not, hov/ever, appear to be over confident of achieving anything in the near future especially as he was due to leave that day for four months sick leave. In his absence, his Chief of Staff, COLONEL GUILANSHAH, will act for him. The Colonel is extremely pro-American, and now tnat the American credit has been authorised, it will not be his fault if American aircraft are not recommended and acquired for tte re-equipping of the Persian Air Force. In this connection the Air Attache was informed by the American Air attache that Thunderbolts would probably/be seen in Teheran. /soon. 2. On the 4th. the Air Attache flew to MESHED and returned via the S.E. Caspian area on the 6 th., having made a reconnaisance of the area flown over. 3. On the 9th, he made a further flight over the Caspian area, noting the new landing ground at RESHT and harbour installations at the Port of NOU SHAH. DEPARTMENT OF C IVIL AVIATION. 4* The Director General of the Persian Department of Civil Aviation hopes to present his Air Navigation Bill soon after the opening of Parliament on the 17th July, provided that the parliament approves of his Bill there should be little delay in ratifying the Chicago Convention and of concluding bi-lateral- air agreements with the various countries operating or wishing to operate air seivices to Teheran. 5. Further to para.10 of Summary No.12/47. the American Air Attache stated that he had heard that the Persians had issued another ultimatum to the Russians demanding the cessation of their air services in Persia. This ultimatum should expire about the 20th of Ju^y. Bearing in mind the Persians previous efforts to take a firm stand in this meat ter, it would be advisable to wait actual denouement before gauging the effectiveness of this most recent effort by the Persians to rid tnemselves of the Russian air services.- 2 Page.3/ over. IRANIAN AIRWAYS. 6 . On the 13th. MR. APSHAR, one of the Directors of this airline, visited the Air Attache and made the same proposition which he had put forward to the Civil Air attache Cairo, and which MR. EBTAHAJ, the Managing Director of this airline, had proposed to B.O.A.C. In effect this proposal envisaged a complete severance from all jjnerican influence in Iranian Airways and the re-placing of the American pilots and ground crews by Britishers, There is no doubt that the American pilots and ground crev/s ana some of tne management, have been purely self-seeking in their work with Iranian Airways. They have at all times taken great care to prevent any non American nationals from gaining any sa^ in tne operafcion of this airline, and it is known that 80 ^ of their pilots are medically unfit to fly and that only two have internationally recognised transport pilot's licences. Once Iranian Airways dispenses with their services they realise full well that they will have considerable^difficulty in securing equally remunerative employment• EAGLE AIRLINES. 7 , It is learnt that Mr. Maxwell, B.O.A.C. Foreign Advisor, is due to visit Teheran early in August, to place definite proposals before the Persian Board of Directors. As this airliners licence to operate expires on the first of September, it will be necessary to move quickly if this venture is not to be still-born. FOREIGN AIRLIN ES. B. 0. A.

It is hoped that this service will be non priority apart from perhaps Wo seats allotted to the British Embassy which will be subject to release if not required. The inauguration 01 a non priority service will go a long way to re-establishing B.O.A.C’s popularity in this part of the \/orld.

THE SHAH kindly agreed to see the films depicting military and civil aircraft which the Air Attache had previously shown to the Air Force and Government Officials. The SHAH was most impressed by the Mosquito, and if funds are available, he wishes to see a Mosquito wing introduced into the Air Force, He was also impressed by the performance of the Miles Messenger and has asked for further details of this aircraft with a view to acquiring one. In conversation with the Air Attache, the SHAH expressed the hope that we and the Americans would assist in building up an efficient Persian Air Force which might enable them to cut down the strength of the Army. He showed a quick grasp of technical air matters and had obviously taken the trouble to study the performance figures of several British and American aircraft. 2, On the 26th. the Air Attache visited the abandoned landing ground at GURGAN, near the town of that name on the S.E. corner of the Caspian. Details o^ this airfield will be included as an Appendix in the next Summary. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION. DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AVIATION. 3. As reported in para,5. of Summary No.14/47, the Persian Government requested the Russians to terminate their air services inside Persia and also their service between MOSCOW and TEHERAN. The latter could be renewed after the conclusion of a bi-lateral air agreement which would give the Persians reciprocal rights, or if special permission was obtained for each flight. About the 20tb. of July services ceased, but the Russians have asked for a final flight to be made to TABRIZ and MESHED to collect radio and maintenance equipment. They are packing up at MEHRABAD MERBORT, TEHERAN, but intend to retain one hangar which indicate s that they foresee special flights from MOSCOV/. As a consequence, Iranian Airways are now flying three times weekly between TEHERAN/iIESHED and TEHERAN/TABRIZ opera.ting to full capacity. 4. The cessation of the Russian services inside Persia have particularly affected the meteorological facilit'es available at MEHRABAD, at a time when everyone was well pleased with the marked improvement which MR.

ADJuDANI flying solo in a Tiger .uoth, landed dorm v/ind on a small landing ground near the Persian Air Force air to ground range east of TEHERAN, over-shot the area, ran into a ditch and v/rote-off tiie Tiger ;oth. He suffered minor facial injuries but apart from that vras unliurt. As far as is knovm no disciplinary action has been taken against him for this flagrant breach of airmanship. The flying training programme of the Hurricane squadron continues altnough tnere is some indication that pilots are making excuses not to fly as they are dissatisfied v.lth their pay. 3* _ In conversation v/ith COLONEL 3IAHP00SH, the Chief Technbal Oificer oi tne air x-'orce, tne Air Attache ■'./as inforuied that the former had grave misgivings about the present plans to train more oiiicers xor tne Air Force. The Air Force is already over-staffed i/itn oxficers and e_.:tremely short ol' maintenance personnel. The difficulty apparently lies in the fact that few young men are v/illing co join the Air x ‘orce unless they can be offered some prospect of odG aining oixicer sbatus, as the pay of Other Ranks is extremely poor. It is hoped, hovrever, to train a larger number of civilian technicians in the Air xorce factory. As civilian technicians enjoy higher pay and more freedom tnere is more chance of obtaining volunteers in this branch than in recruiting for the permanent Air Force. Steps have already been taken to centralise all maintenance under the command of the Chief Technical Officer and arounc. the repair vorkshops in Teneran. Maintenance personnel are then allotted from the v/orkshops to squadrons and detached units where daily and minor inspections are carried out. All major inspections are Handled by the central v/orkshops. The Chief Technical Officer //ould lixe to see the civilian establishment of the centra.l workshops raised from the present 300 to 500 and at the same time a large reduction in technical officer establishment and training scheme. ' } * On the 2nd. and the 4th. the Air Attaclie had meetings with the Minister of jar concerning the possible supply of Mosquitoes to cne lersian Air x'orce. At the second meeting tne Minister of war stated that R.I.M. the Shah wished to be assured that the Mosquitoes ./ere constructionally suitable for operation in Persia. The Shah had apparently been informed by someone, ixossibly COLONEL GUILANSHAHj Deputy Head of the Air Force, that trouble had been experienced vith Mosquitoes in India. The Air Attache was able to assure the Minister of Mar that apart from the very early ty^es of Mosquito all later types v/ere specially treated to resist climatic conditions, and that CAPTAIN. JALK2R of DE HAVILLANDS, during his recent visit to TEHERAN, had conximed that tne Mosquito was no./ capable of operating satisfactorily in any part of the Y/o &lt; rld. , Para.. 6 .

Pjs to whether the present Head of the Air I‘orce, GENERAL Ai.OJJl, \ 7 ho''±s''a , tr^'rr«rse^t on four months sick leave, 'Jill in fact return to the Air Force. The Air Attache Y/as informed tnat the Shah was at present inclined to leave COLONEL GUILANSHAH as Leputy Head of the A.ir Force for a trial v^eriod. The Colonel v/ill be eligible for promotion to BRIGADIER at tne end of the current Persian year. Apart from his poorly concealed anti- British attitude he is not popular v/lth all elements of the Air Force. Although he is a good pilot he is not a good demonstrator. On tiie other hand, COLONEL BAYLNDOR who has been absent from Persia for some 1u years as lersian Air Attache in London, is in character and capability vrell suited to command the Air Force. Owing, hov/ever, to his long absence from the country it vrould be advise able to have him work in some subordinate position until he is better known to the younger officers and tne Other Ranks of the Air Force. COLONEL BAYBNDOR is/due back in Teheran, and his future will depend largely /shortly upon the reception which H.I.II. The Shah gives him. PERSI AN C IV IL AVI A TION. d: par tmsnt of cjjil aviation._ 7. Confirmation has now been received that tne Russians have closed down their offices at the TABRIZ and 1 HUSHED airfields. They have also evacuated PAHL3VI landing ground. The one building on the latter has now been taken over by tne Persian Gendarmerie. 8 . MR. CHAFIK, the Director General of the Department of Civil Aviation, recently made a tour oi the Casxiian area and has informed the Air Attache that landing grounds at CHALUS and 3ABULSAR will soon be fit for use. Details of these will be forwarded when they have been completed. MR. CHAFIK also visited the abandoned airfield at GURGAN and he informed the Air Attache that it was his intention to enlarge it. Details of this airfield are attached at Appendix W A', and vrere obtain from a personal visit by the Air Attache in July, 1947. 9. ,/ING COMMANDER HILL of B.O.A.C. arrived in TEHERAN on the 4th to discuss the merger of the proposed Eagle A.irlines and the existing Iranian Airways. One of his first achievements was to persuade MR. CHAFIK to accept the principle of the allocation of internal routes between Eagle Airlines and Iranian Airways, Since then he has obtained the two airline Companies agreement in principle to the merger. A great amount of work will have to go into the clearing up of the Iranian Airways financial position and also to the actual terms of the merger. LING CQLIANDER HILL should leave Teheran for the U.K. on the 15th of August, and he will be submitting a full report. In the meantime it is hoped that three Doves may be obtained inside the next six weeks in order to start up the Eagle Airline on internal services. FOREIGN AIRLINES. NIL.*g»* r EX' GEITOAL^ 10. On the 4th. a special Dakota of TATA Airline arrived in TEHERAN en route to NOS CO'./ vrlth MRS. I’AHDIT and party. The aircraft left for MOSCO*/ on the 6 th and arrived the same day, having landed at BAKU AND STALINGRAD. It returned to TEHERAN on the 10th and left for INDIA on the 11th via BASRA. The Russians adapted their usual practice of putting on board the aircraft a Second Tilotj Navigator and Radio Operator for the flight to MOGCC and back. The Captain of the aircraft stated that the Russian crevr were friendly and helpful, interesting fact he mentioned v/as that he vas made to land on the grass beside the concrete runv/ays at BAKU and STALINGRAD. He appeared to think that this was a practice adopted by the R u ssia..s to save wear on the concrete runways. During the winter months the runways would naturally be necessary. 11 . On the 2nd. MAJOR CARVER, the U.S. Air Attache, left TEHERAN. MAJOR STEELE succeeds him. 12. On the ?th. a demonstration Miles Aerovan arrived in TEHERAN and was found to have one faulty magneto. Jith the co-operation of COLONEL SIALOOSH of the I'ersian Air Force, a spare part was obtained and it is hoped to hold the demonstration on the 12th. H.I.M. The SHAH inspected the aircraft on the ground on tne 8 th. The Shah is about to place an order for a Miles Messenger. 13 . About the 1st. of August, a privately owned American C.46 arrived in TEHERAN from the States with a large consignment of Rayon for a local Persian merchant. The operation of tnis aircraft by its owner flown crew provides an interesting departure in civil aviation similar to that of the operation of a tramp steamer. The owners were willing to take freight anywhere in the Middle East or even to sell the aircraft. Eventually they undertook to carry a large consignment of Opium to some destination in the .Middle East and it is understood that a si.ailar flight to India was proposed but they are unwilling to go further East owing to the increased distances involved from their maintenance base.

COLONEL BAYENDOR,mentioned in paragraph 6 of Suminary No, 17, is now serving as Chief of Staff under COLONEL GUILANSHAHj v/ho is still acting Head of the Air Force. 2. Preparations are being^ made for the Army Co-operation exercises mentioned in paragraph 1 of the last Summary, The date of the exercises has been put back to about the 16th September. Y. r /CDR, GIBBS, the pilot and Head of the Hawker Team in Teheran, is to lead most of the flying formations and he will give a solo demonstration of rocket firing. Since the departure of MR. DARBYSHIRE, the Armourer on the Hav/ker Team in early June, no replacement has yet arrived in Teheran and in the absence of any trained Persian Armourers there j-S some doubt as to whether the Hurricanes will be ready for the exercises on the 16th. At the request of the Cuief of the General Staff, the Air Attache has suggested to Air Ministry, that if Hawkers are prepared to meet all expenses and Air Ministry agrees, an R.A.F. armourer could perhaps be supplied on loan to the Persians from Iraq until Hawkers replacement arrives in Teheran. 3. Large consignments for the Persian Air Force of spares, motor transport and workshop machinery, have,/or are about to arrive at/arrive Basra in the near future. The question has now arisen of how to transfer this bulky equipment back to a Persian port and whether the financial responsibility will rest with the R.A.F. or the Persians. It is unfortunate that this equipment could not have been consigned direct to Bandar Shapur as requested by the Persians, who have an Army movements detachment there capable of ensuring speedy handling and despatch to Teheran of equipment for the Ministry of ..'ar, A. The Persian Air Force detachment at Tabriz has been strengthened by an additional flight of 5 Hinds. This step is part of the Chief of General Staff's general plan for the tightening up of security in Azerbaijan. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION. D EPART M ENT OF CIVIL AV I ATION . 5. On the 7th. Hr. Chafik left by air for Cairo in H.I.M. The Shah's private converted Fortress. Thile in Cairo it is expected that Mr. Chafik will consult with B.O.A.C. and the British Civil Air Attache on questions of the supply of radio equipment and its installation. It is also hoped that he will be able to discuss with the Civil Air Attache the draft Anglo-Iranian civil aviation air agreement, which is about to be negotiated with the Persian Government, It is understood that Mr. Chafik also intends to meet the Senior Meteorological Officer of Headquarters, R.A.F. MED/ME to discuss the Meteorological organisation in Persia.

Mr. Chafik informed the Air Attache that Babulsar landing ground was now fit for use by light aircraft. Pending further details and a personal visits only the following information is available. Approximate position 36 AO N. 5 2 38 E. J &gt;2 miles due south of Babulsar on the east side of the main road. Approximate dimensions N/S, 1,000 metres, E/W. 800 metres. At present only N/S direction is used for landing. The surface is firm turf and there are no facilities or identification marks at present. Duiing the past week members of the Royal Family have flown to Babulsar icr the day and it is understood that in the near future the present State Airline mail service to Resht and Pahlevi will be extended to make the round trip through Babulsar and so back to Teheran. EAGLE AIRLINES. Although definite information is not available, it is thought that the State Department is working hard to persuade T.V.A. to renew their association with Iranian Airways, As Mr. Chafik is unwilling to divide internal routes, B.O.A.C.'s proposed support of Eagle Airlines would inevitably result in direct competition between the Americans and ourselves on the same routes. There is a fai.M hope that if T. /.A. and B.O.A.C. could agree between themselves to divide routes, then Chafik and the Persian Government would have no objection, but if this cannot be done and T.U.A. does reappear on the scene, then British participation in Eagle Airlines is unlikely. IRANIAN AIR./AYS. 9 . Serviceability is still extremely low with on an average two to three aircraft serviceable out of their 14. In addition, instances such as the captain of an aircraft oversleeping and not turning up for a flight when all thu passengers had been kept -waiting for several hours, do not improve the popularity or earning capacity of the few aircraft which are serviceable. Contrary to the instructions of Hr. Chafik, one of this airline's aircraft flew to Resht and back agaii:. Mr. Chafik had stated that in his opinion Resht airfield was not fit for Dakotas. On the aircraft's return to Teheran it ms grounded by Mr. Chafik who had it sealed and a guard placed upon it. After heated discussions and three days inactivity the aircraft was released.

PERSIAN AIR FORCE. 1 # It is now learnt that during a rehe ground straffing exercises mentioned in paragraph .1 No. 17/47, the pilot of a Hind engaged in dive bomb pull out of his dive in time and wrote-off himself t. This accident had an adverse effect upon the pilots of the Hind detachment and in tneir demonstration the following day before Arir\y Commanders their performance was far from satisfactory. This poor showing resulted in tne Chief of General Staff's decision to hold a further demonstration as mentioned in paragraph. 2 . of the last Summary. More attention has been given to the preparation for this exercise and if successful it should help to persuade Army Commanders that aircraft 0 r. be used more effectively in operations. 2. On the 8 th., at a meeting with the Chief of General Staff, the Air Attache was again asked to provide a. R.A.F. Armourer until Hawkers could produce their replacement. The Air Attache visited R.A.F. HABBANIYA between the 9th and 14 th for an engine change to his Avro XIX. During this visit arran^eme ntswere completed for the loan of an Armourer to return to Teheran with the Air Attache and who has since been able to prepare the Hurricanes for the exercises mentioned above. During the meeting with the Chief of General Staff the latter again stressed his desire to build up the efficiency cf the Air Force and so to enable him, if possible, to reduce Army units. 3. During the Air Attache's visit to HABBANIYA arrangements were completed for the shipping of the equipment mentioned in paragraph 3 of tbe last Summary, from Basra to Bandar Shapur. On the 19th. the Air Attacne discussed this question witn the Orders Department of the Ministry of Mar, and clarified the position concerning the return of tne Workshop machinery. 4 . COLONEL BAYEIT'OR, mentioned in paragraph. 1. of the last Summary, is gradually introducing minor reforms into the organisation of the headquarters and Squadrons and is gaining the confidence of all ranks in his efforts to improve efficiency and discipline.

DEPARTMENT O F CIVIL AVIATI ON. OONTIMJE D. 7 . IfiR. LEFEVRE informed the Air Attache that,in his opinion, MR. CHAFIN's plans for the developement of Civil Aviation in Persia were sound and generally in accordance with I.C.A.O. recommendations. The only difficulty which he foresaw was that no definite plans were in train for a Persian meteorological service,which in his opinion, was a first essential. He also confirmed that very tentative discussions had taken place for I.C.A.O. technical assistance to Persia during the initial stages of the developement of airfields, radio communications etc. 8 . H.M. G-overnment has presented to tne Persian Government for their consideration, a draft bilateral Air Agreement. It is known that the American Government has made a similar approach for a USA/Persian Air Agreement, and in this connection the American Ambassador informed the Air Attache that they were not progressing very fast in their negotiations, and that it appeared that the Persians were unwilling to clinch matters. The reason for this may be that which Mr. Lefevre suggested to the Air Attache. Namely that at Chicago in 1944 the Persians had signed the I.A.S.T.A. and the I.A.T.A. This had been done before the Persian Department of Civil Aviation had been form/and before anyone as knowledgeable as Mr. Chafik had /ed interested himself in civil aviation in Persia. Sweden was the first country to invoke the I.A.T.A. when they started their service to Teheran. Since then other countries have invoked it and Mr. Lefevre stated that the Director-General of the Persian Department of Civil Aviation was now in a quandary, as most countries were pressing for bilateral Air Agreements / in view of /which the I.A.T.A. were difficult to with-hold. As civil aviation policy in Persia is still in the process of formation, the Persian Government now feel that they have left themselves open to any country desiring to operate services into Persia which may be detrimental to the interests of their own airlines and in some cases undesirable. They are, therefore, v/aiting to see whether the I.A.T.A. 'v/ill be modified in any way by I.C.A.O. EAGLE AIRLINES. 9. B;C.A. C's decision to assist this airline is still held up pending the clarification of the American attitude in relation to Iranian Airways. It is understood that as Persia falls within Pan American Airways territory, the State Department would like to see them come to the assistance of the stricken Iranian Airways. IRANIAN AIRWAYS. 10. There is no change in the low serviceability of this airline and Mr. Ebtahaj is now in France attempting to find engineers and pilots. FOREIGN AIRLINES. EX I r&gt;-| a r B.O.A.C.

HCLivIAN arrived in Teheran as Hawkers replacement for their Armourer who left some months ago. After a few days in which to hand over S/LDR. HOIitAN was able to relieve the R.A.F. Armourer who had been lent by R.A.F. Station, HABBANIYA, and who returned to HABBANIYA on the 28th. 2 # Officers of the Air Force believe that/definite /a order has now been agreed with the Americans for 45 Thunderbolts, 45 Harvards and about 25 Stinson elementary trainers. Despite tneir. conviotion that the order is about to be fulfilled, the American Ain Attache and GENERAL GROM, the Head of the American Military Mission, do not appear to share their belief that everything is now cut and dried. The Air Ministry has now informed the Air Attache that Mosquitos F.B.YI are available for sale to the Persian Air Force and that complete ground and air courses are available for aircrew and ground technicians. This information has been passed to the Chief of General Staff, The Hawker Team has agreed with the Ministry of bar that they should all take their annual leave together during October. Some of the team have returned to the United Kingdom vriiile others are spending their leave locally. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION. lEPARTMENT OF CIV IL AVIATION. At a meeting with the Air Attache, the Director- General stated that during his recent visit to Egypt he had ordered through the British Supply Disposals Office, meteorological equipment for four meteorological outstations. At the same time he had enquired about the loan of an R.A.F. meteorologist to visit Teheran to advise the Department on the setting up of a Persian meteorological organisation. The British Civil Air Attache in Cairo subsequently received a further telegram concerning the loan of this specialist, and Mr. Chafik stated that he intended to clarify this matter with the Civil Air Attache by letter. For a time most of the national and foreign airlines were either held up or operating diversionary services owing to the outbreak of Cholera in Egypt. Now, however, passengers and aircrew have been inoculated and all the services have been resumed. EAGLE AIRLINES. As the Americans have not yet indicated whether they going to renew assistance to Iranian Airways or not, no progress hccS been made in the setting up of this airline with the assistance of B.O.A.C.- 2 - Page.3/ IRATJIM AIR' 1 ..'AYS. 8 . The management and operation of this airline remains extremely poor and it is symptomatio of the low maintenance and moral state of this airline that recently one of their foreign engineers v/as removed from his position as Chief Engineer and Inspector, because he had refused to sign out aircraft which by normal standars were unserviceable. The new Chief Engineer is more accommodating. Despite the State Departments professed anxiety to see an American Airline • supporting Iranian Airways again, it is known that T.'J.A. in Cairo recently refused to consider any further assistance in any form. On the 15th. Mr. Pearson, one of T.V/.A’s Vice-Presidents, is believed to be due in Teheran to settle outstanding differences but not necessarily to propose any new alliance. It is difficult to see hov/ the State Department will be able to persuade any American Airline to help Iranian Airways owing to their extremely bad record and their financial difficulties. IRANIAN STATE AIRLINE. 9 . On the 22nd. at a meeting with the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones,. , r , the Air Attache was asked to make enquiries for the immediate delivery of 5 twin engined aircraft to carry the airmail inside Persia. The Minister explained that tne aircraft were needed urgently owing to Iranian Airway's inability to carry the mails. The specification for the type of aircraft required fitted the performance of the De Havilland Dove and possibly the G-uncliffe-Owen Concordia. This request was immediately transmitted to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and to the Civil Air Attache in Cairo, wno advised various aircraft firms in England, with the result tnat the Air Attache received several offers to put before the lersiauis of Vikings and Concordias. 10. Since the setting up of Iranian Airways and the proposed Eagle Airlines, the policy of the Persian Government concerning their so-called postal air service has been uncertain, Iranian Airway's failure to provide adequate air se vices has driven the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones to consider enlarging their own air service. Judging, however, from the Minister's remarks, it *ls' not his intention to set up any form of airline, but to have an adequate fleet of light aircraft to ensure .w’ all the year round carriage of mails and occasional Government Officials. He thought that if any Persian airline proved itself capable of reliable services his Ministry might consider disposing ' of their aircraft. 11. In the meantime the three Dominies of the Iranian State Airline continue to function satisfactorily. FOREIGN AIRLINES. 12. There is no change in the previously reported schedules of foreign airlines operating into Persia.GENERAL. -] Further to paragraph 12 of the last Sumuiary, the third and last charter flight by B.E.A. to move Opium from Teheran to Spain, was undertaken by Halifax of L.A.-'.S., which left Teheran on the 24th. 12 ^ On the 26th. a U.S. Air Transport Command Skymaster arrived in Teheran with a party of Congressmen on a twenty four hour 'Fact Finding' visit.

FORTNIGHT RISING. 1 9T H XTOBE R , 1947 . SECRET. PERSIAN AIR FORCE. 1. On the 7th. H.I.M. THE SHAH, Senior Army and Air Force Officers, v/itnessed the long awaited ground attack demonstration by the Air Force. The only foreign Service Attaches- present were the British and American Air Attaches. A detailed report on this demonstration has been submitted. As mentioned in previous Summaries^ the object of this exercise was to impress Army Commanders with the Air Force's ability to deal with ground targets. It is doubtful, however, v/hether this was achieved, as the accuracy of the bombing left a great deal to be desired, while the air to ground firing owed its moderate accuracy to the extremely low altitude from which pilots fired. In mitigation of the pilots and bomb aimers errors in bombing and firing, it snould be borne in mind that the maintenance of flying instruments and bomb-sights is extremely poor, Sueh is / bomb aimers lack of faith in their sights ' that many of /th them rely solely upon their own judgement. It is not surprising therefore that level bombing from a medium altitude tends to be somewhat erratic. Instances of bombs 'hanging-up' are not unknown and pilots show an unusual discretion in avoiding populated areas. During the exercise there \rere occasional, explosions several miles away from the target ana these were casually dismissed as being due to quarrying work, 2, On the 16th. the Air Force was reviewed by H. 1,1. THE SHAH at its Headquarters at DOSHAN TA1PEH. Senior Court, Government and Army Officials were present. No foreign representatives were invited. Tne occasion was tne first anniversary of the presentation to tne Shah of his 'wings’, and it is understood that this will become an annual event. HIS .A.JE3TY presented diplomas and wings to several pilot graduates of tnc. Flying School. The usual' fly past of 20 Hinds, 10 Ansons and 16 Hurricanes, together with a aerobatic display by 2 Hurricanes, completed the proceedings. 3* By agreement with the General Staff, the Hawker team is taking a months leave during October. There was some doubt whether the Persians would be able to service tne Hurricanes during the team's absence, but with the two demonstrations mentioned above to spur them on, they have so far succeeded in producing aircraft when needed, although this has no doubt been achieved at the expense of normal flying training. A. There has • been no reaction to the R.A.F's confirmation that mosquitos could be supplied to the Persian Air Force. The ministry of Par has, however, decided to send to England for technical training, about 60 apprentices. To date negotiations have been conducted verbally and written confirmation is awaited. The Persians have also asked whether the R.A.F. could train 40 pilots from the ab initio to the O.T.U. standard. Owing to R.A.F. commitments, however, it is doubtful v/hether this request con be met*V Page.3/ over. PERSIAN AIR FORCE ( CON TINUED ). 5 # It is understood tnat the Air Force also hopes to obtain 7 transport Dakotas from the Americans as well as the aircraft mentioned in previous Summaries. The American Air Attache stated that many of the aircraft provisionally earmarked for the Persians are now in Germany, and once the agreement is concluded the aircraft will be ^i-vailable for immediate flight delivery, although, as the Americans are not likely to provide ferry crews except perhaps for formation leaders, it is difficult to see how the aircraft will reach ieheran until I^/sians qualifbdon the particular type of aircraft are availlblu. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION. DEPART- IE FT OF C IVIL AVIATION . At Appendix 'A' details are given of the QIM ivl/F D/F beacon, and comments on the Landing Ground at BIRDJAND and QUM. Owing to the outbreak of cholera in Egypt no aircraft which comes from that country is allowed to enter Persia. Recent regulations publisned by the IRAQI and PERSIAN Governments concerning the movement of travellers between their two countries and further afield, are conflicting and efforts are being made to obtain clarification. It is understood that the meteorological Office at MEHRABAD AIRPORT, Teneran, is now working ^n a 24 hour basis. Apparently a woman meteorologist of German origin, who worked in the meteorological section of tne Luftwaffe during the war, is now employed by the Department. Being married to a Persian she is able to work in a Persian Government department without rasing any difficulties over nationality. To date, she is the only person capable of producing a reliable synoptic chart. EAGLE AIRLINES. c) # Th e Americans have so far taken no steps to implement their professed continued interst in Iranian Airways. In the face of this delay and Iranian Airways’ weakened state, B.O.A.C. may push ahead with the setting up of this airline. IRANIAN AIRIA.YS. &gt; 10 . The traffic offering between Paris and Teheran recently persuaded this airline to charter a Dakota from a Norwegian Charter Company (OLSENS) &gt;1 &gt;] # It is believed that this airline has signed on two new ground engineers, a Norwegian and a Frenchman, services are practically at a standstill.PERSIAN CIVIL A VISION ( CO NTINUED) IRANIAN STATE AIRLINE. 12, Further to para,9. of the last Summary, the offers of Vikings and Concordias have, as expected, proved too expensive, and at the suggestion of Mr, Chafik, the Minister of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones is now considering the purchase of five Miles Geminis, Miles Aircrcft have already stated that five Geminis could be delivered one month after the necessary order had been placed. For the type of work'envisaged by the Persians, these aircraft should be eminently suitable, especially as it is hoped to start airmail services to many outlying places which are not equipped with recognised landing grounds. FOREIGN AIRLINES. B.O.A.C. 13* Pith the increase of fares on the LONDON/ TEHERAN service and owing to the Iraqi Governments' recent regulations forbidding the passage of freight through Iraq, which is destined for or has come from Lydda, the LONDON/TEHERAN service has been hard hit. Conflicting cholera regulations have not improved the situation. K. JLi.U. 14. It is understood tnat a proving flight is shortly to be undertaken from AMSTERDAM to TEHERAN via PRAGUE and ANKARA.

On the 22nd the Air Attache was summoned by the Chief of General Staff ana later by H. I.i/I. THE SHAH to discuss tne training in the United Kingdom of apprentices and pilots. THE SHAH expressed his desire to preserve our influence in tne Persian Air Force, and confirmed the fact tnat it was intended to acquire further British aircraft. As the lersian Air Force is chronicly short of technicians and to a lesser extent pilots, it is understandable that attention is now concentrated on training. This has/accentuated/the probable acquisition of American aircraft /by and the rumour that the Americans are not willing to undertake tde training of Persian personnel for the time being. 2. Further to para.4. of the last Summary, confirmation has been received that urgent steps are being taken by the Persian Air Force to prepare the Apprentices for departure to the United Kingdom towards the ena of November. The General Staff is considering the training of pilots at a civil flying school in England with the provision of C.T.U. training either in England or in Persia. 3* On the 25th. and the 30th. the Air Attache inspected the airfields at Meshed and Isfahan.

The LOWDON/TEHERAN service has been adjusted to permit the aircraft to arrive in Teheran on Tuesday afternoons, thus giving the crews a days rest be-fore leaving on the return flight on Thursday mornings. The disposable load on the limiting sector between Baghdad and Lydda has again been reduced owing to the winter weather, which, allowing for Bagndad's two seats, only permits Teheran to put five passengers on the aircraft. This weekly quota is completely inadequate for Teheran's requirements. K. L. i/i. 10. It is understood that the first proving flight with a Convair 240, is due in Teheran in the near future.

At Aehrabad Airport a course has been started which aims to produce individuals capable of combining tne duties of meteorological observer, radio operator and mechanic . At present twelve young Persians from tne Teheran Technical High School form the first course. MR. CHAPIK states that progress is satisfactory and that the individuals, ’when fully qualified, will be sent m pairs to out stations throughout Persia. 8 . HR. CHAPIK stated that tue Meteorological Oifice at Mehrabad Airport was now almost fully equipped.

At long last the necesss.ry sterling permit for £ 25,000 has been obtained to meet the deposit on tie three Doves for this airline. It is hoped that the first Dove will arrive during January.

It is difficult tov&gt;j?Qphesy the future of this airline. Of their 16 Dakotas at Mehrabad Airport, 8 are in the so callea cemetery in a cannabalised state, 5 in a partially cleaned up condition are without engines, 1 is serviceable and is bein^, used for internal services, 1 has flown to Ians for overhaul, and the last one has recently arrived ex Ame ican Disposals at Paynef ieId^ Cairo J&gt;he. American ground ana air crews have now left and apart from Iranian co-pilots, tney only have a Drench pilot named OHAl'ELARL, who , it is understood, flew for Vichy during the war and only managed to leave Prance on a forged passport during this year. CKA'fELARD is acting as Chief of 0 p e rat ions as his flying days are nearly over and his entnusiasm for this type of occupation is not great. Passengers m aircraft which he has flown have not shovm any great liking for his low flying or kangaroo type landings,. The only other Captains of aircraft are TISSANDIER, a nationalised dritisher of French extraction who flew with distinction with the R.A.F. during the war, and a Captain PALM, D.S.O. , ex S.A.A.F.

On the 29th December, LIEUTENANT uOEBI mSls detailea to do a 400 mile cross-country flight in a Hurricane. Despite careful pre-flight briefing he disregarded his compass, lost himself, ana finally forced landed through lacK of petrol be side a railway line about 60 miles e&amp;st of YEHuRAN. Desiite his poor navigation, credit is due to him for lanain 0 his hurricane successfully upon a tract of country. Rain on the following days made the ground unfit for take-off. A salvage party was therefore despatched by train, the wings were dismantled, loaded on &amp; railway flat and returned to TEHERAN. The aircraft has been reassembled and is once -more se rv ice able. 2. On the 25th. at QALEH MORGHEH, a Persian pilot in an Anson, disregarded the advice of his Second pilot, landed dovm- wind with the wind on his quarter, ground looped, with the result that the undercarriage collfpsed and extensive damage was done to wings, fuselage, propellers, ana engine nacelles. 3 . At MEHRABAD AIRIORT on the 7th. CAPTAIN KHATEil, whilst taxying a Tiger Hoth, collided v;ith a concret stanchion and damaged the aircraft's undercarriage, v/ing and propeller. A. This succession of accidents due to bad flying discipline, v/ao discussed by the Air Attache with Senior Officers of the Air Force, during the formers visit to tne Flying Training School at DO SHAN TAPPER on the dth. COLONEL GUILIANSHAH remarked that in tne days of REZA SHAH disciplinary action was prompt and severe ranging from tne dismissal of the Head of the Air Force to imprisonment for the pilots.. No. - , however, such measures .ere not practicable. The Air Attache stated that accidents of this nature could only be countered by a determined and sustained drive to make all flyirg personnel accident conscious. Flying discipline snould be tightened up and airfield controllers should be introduced. 5 . COLONEL ADAviS, tne U.3.A.F. Advisor to the Persian Air force, informed tne Air Attache tnat he had come to tne conclusion after more than a year's experience of tue iersian Air force, that, in his opinion, the iersian Air Force could not do better that continue to model itself on R.A.F. lines, to have its personnel trained by the R.A.F. and to re-equip with British aircraft. His main reason for arriving at tms conclusion is that he believes that the British can train the personnel and provide aircraft at prices well below any similar American offer, and tdc t as the Persian Ai- r Force’s budget is always inadequate, the greatest good could be done v/ith what little tney do receive by obtaining training and equipment from the British. ,Needless to say, this refreshing admission was not well received by GENERAL. GRG /, the Head of theI'age. 3 that T2 American Military Mission to Ambassador. 6 . ; r - At a meeting v.ith the Chief of General Staff on the 10th. various matters concerning tne Air Porce were discussed including pilot training and discipline. Arrangements were also made for a meeting between the Minister of './ar, the Chief oif General Staff ana Admiral Palliser, C-in-C, East Indies, wno is expected in*' TEHERAN in tne near future, on a courtesy visit. 7. VISIT TO IRANIAN AIR FORCE PLTING TRAIMNG S CHOOL . With tne consent of tne Chief of General Staff, the Air Attache visited tne Plying I r aining School at DCSHAN TAl'PEH on the 8 th. The statements mane in paragraph 7 of Summary No.22 of 1946 concerning the Air Attache's previous visit to the Plying Training School, need little modification. 8 . Elementary flying is at present divided into two courses. The first consists of 14 ffficers who have completed two years' study at the Military Academy. The second ig made up of 40 direct entrants who have completed high school education. As previously stated, lack of qualified flying instructors and aircraft only enables elementary flying to consist of about 60 hours flying, which is usually spread over about a year. The percentage of pilot rejects is approximately 207',. Plying instruction is based on tne R.A.P. Instructors Handbook of Elementary Plying, and appears to be adhered to fairly closely. Although, on this occasion, tne Air Attache only visited tne school buildings he hopes to visit the flying side in tne near future. Advanced flying is based on the R.A.P. Instructors Handbook of Advanced Plying Training, but owing to lack of facilities only about ^0 to 60 hours flying is carried out on this course. Additional training is left to the Regiments when new pilots have been drafted to them. 9. The Air Attache was impressed by the progress which had been made in fitting out classrooms and trie provision of instructional material. Although by R.A.F. standards they are still inadequate, bea,ing in mind the Persian Air Force's lack of funds and instructors, the progress must be regarded as premising. At the present rate of progress tiie pilots now in training will not be available for tde Regiments until tue end of this year-, with little nope of further pilots until 195^. If tne Air Porce is therefore re-equipped with one or more nev/ squadrons in the nesr future, they will definitely experience some difficulty in finding pilots. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION.

During his visit he had several meetings with Mr. Chafik, D.C.A. , in connection witn trie provision of British civil aviation advisors. As indicated in previous Summaries, tne D.C.A. , altnough anxious to obtain advisors to assist in tne organisation of civil aviation in Persia, is not able at tne moment, to engage foreigners. The proposal vra put for « rd that the advisors be engaged by Eagle Airlines, and that they should in turn contract direct witn the Persian Government for the services of tne individuals concerned.

SECRET, HERS IAN AIR F ORCE &gt; ^• On the 22nd, His Excellency, the British Ambassador, presented the insignia of the Order of the British Empire to COLONEL BAYENDCR, who relinquished his appointment as Persian Air Attache in London, last year, COLONEL BAYENDOR has always worked for close understanding between the Persian Air Force and the Royal Air Force, tnd has been largely responsible / maintaining our predominant /for influence in the Persian Air Force over tne last 15 years. He is now serving as Chief of Staff in tne Air Force. Despite the large pack-up of Hurncance spares which accompanied the aircraft, the Air Force now finds it is short of certain airframe ana engine spares which are urgently needed to complete inspections. Df the 34 hurricanes,b are on minor inspections. Delay in completing v/ork was also caused by the absence on leave of certain members of tne Hawker team. Despite many suggestions by the Air Force to the General Staff to decentralise maintenance and the location of operational units, the General Staff does not appear to be willing to permit any major air formotion to be based outside Teheran, At the present moment all operational units, maintenance and repair facilities are concentrated in Teheran, with only a few small operational detachments in some provincial capitals. This naturally makes tne Air Force extremely vulnerable ana as some provincial landing grounds are equipped with hangars and accommodation, Isfahan in particular, the policy of the General Staff would appear to be extremely short-sighted. The operational units are not mobile and in emergency, 'would take some time to be moved together with their necessary supporting services. Part of the General Staff's reluctance to decentralise may well lie in the poor discipline and administration of the Air Force which is unlikely to improve unless drastic changes in command are made. 4. All forms of security in the Air Force are . note-worthy by their absence. The root of tne trouble lies firstly in low rates of pay and lack of security which is particularly felt by Other Ranks. It is not an exage ation to say that most of the other ranks suffer from malnutrition. This even applies to young Pilot Officers, who, more than onee have been known to be enfeeblea after a mornings flying. Despite urgent recommenaaticns ior improvements in conditions of service and particularly for realistic rates of pay based on the present cost of living, little has been done, ana senior officers are apparently quite prepared to perpetuate a system which lines their own pockets, regardless of the 'welfare of personnel under them.* • ^3 - 2 - QQ1 i* * 5. About the 17th. CCLOMEL BAYE7IDCR visited Resht landing ground in an Air Force Anson. Despite the knovm soggy state of the sari ace, a landing v/as made, but it took three hours to haul the aircraft on to sufficiently firm ground to enable it to make a very hazardous take-off. 6 . The long outstanding question of the return of the machine tool-s to the aircraft factory nov/ appears to be draving to a satisfactory conclusion. Apart from the machine tools already returned from Iraq, most of the balance has nov/- been shipped from Suez, and should arrive at Bandar Shapur in tne near future. 7. Owing to tne difficulty of ob aining suitable shipment from Basra to Khorramshahr, ana also to tne fact tnat the Persian Consul at Basra aelayea clearance by with-holding shipping papers, the consignment of motor transport for t^e Persian Air Force which arrived at Basra from the Aidale East many months ago, has now, for the most part, had to be serviced by the v.A.P. in Iraq in preparation for eventual, snipment to Khorramshahr. PERSIAN CIVIL AVIATION. DEPARTM ENT OF C IVIL aVIaTION . 8 . Mr. Veryard, the Chief Meteorological Officer, R.A.F. MED/ilE, has haa to postpone his visit to Teheran. It is hoped, however, that he will be able to arrange a visit at a later date, as the Director of Civil Aviation definitely needs expert advice on the setting up of a suitable meteorological organisation in Persia. Although Mr. Chafik’s plan for Persia would appear at first sight to be adequate, it is not known whether it will fit in wich the meteorological organisations in neighbouring countries, and it is therefore important to have advice from an expert acquainted with the organisation of the whole Middle East. 9, This Department is now prepared to issue Airline Pilots, Engineers, Ground and Air Radio licences to individuals who can provide proof that they have the necessary experience in accordance with I.C.A.0. recommendations. Training facilities in iersia at the moment, are limited on the flying side to the Private Pilot’s licence which can be carried out by the Civil Flying Club, and to Ground and Air Radio Operators licences, courses for wnich are now being provided by the Department at Mehrabad Airport. EAGL E AIRLINES . 10. Negotiations are still at a standstill pending the release of sterling. Wing Commander Hill has, however, returned to the United Kingdom for consultation and it is hoped that he will be able to persuade Airwork ana B.O.A.C. to provide aircraft and technical staff on the strength of the personal guarantees provided by tne Directors of this airline. IR ANIAN AIR./AYS. 11. This airline continues to operate regularly its advertised services with the four DsMotas now serviceable. Mr. Chefik confirms his acceptance of tneir standard of serviceability and operation. 12, It is rumoured that the Airline intends to sell one of its serviceable aircraft, but further information is lacking. Pacge.3/FCRiilIGN AIRLINES. The usual seasonal fall-off in passenger traffic has affected all tne foreign airlines operating to Teheran, but most of them heve been able to compensate tnemselves with the large amount of freight offering. GENERAL l 14 . On the 20th. the miles Messenger, ordered by H.I.M. THE SHAH, arrived in Teheran. Tne Shah lost no time in trying out his new aircraft with which he is very satisfied. 12 , Hunting Aerosurveys Limited have commenced their 10,000 square mile photographic survey of aeras in the south of Persia, on behalf of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. An unexpected difficulty arose when the pilot of tne photographic Bristol freighter, dicovered that the attitude of the aircraft at 25,000 feet precluded the operation of the photographic equipment. This difficulty, however, was overcome by descending a few thousand feet.f? Reference: - WJt/JiM.- BRITISH SivffiASSY, TEHERAN. 10th February, 1948.

The rerent Russian Note accusing the Persian Government of allowing the Americans too much influence in the internal affairs of the country, made mention of large airfield construction, including a vast underground petrol storage, at Quin* This is completely inaccurate. Qum landing ground has tv*o very rough natural surfaced runways with no airfield buildings or storage tanks of any description. Neither the Department of Civil Aviation nor the General Staff has any intention of enlarging Qum. If any construction is to be undertaken in that area it will almost certainly be centred at Isfahan, where large hangars already exist. 2. The American credit for the purchase of military material (mentioned in previous summerles) has been reduced from thirty to ten millions and is now before Parliament and may be approved in tne near future. Owing to the reduction of the creait, the original scnedule of equipment has had to be reconsidered. The Army, however, is only likely to receive about two-thirds of the ten millions, ana the Air Force's share of this will naturally be small. Apart from basic training aircraft, the Air Force hopes to obtain a Squadron of Fighter/Borabers and a small number of transport aircraft. H.I.M. the Shah has always pressed for Mustangs for the Fighter Squadron, but the Americans are to date only willing to supply Thunoerbolts. This aircraft woula not be as suited for Arny co-operation as the Mustang, ana as the latter aircraft has Rolls Royce engine, the Air Force's maintenance problems v/ould be simplified, as they already have Hurricanes. If the American credit is approved, then it is most unlikely that any order for British aircraft will be placed for some time to come. If, however, the credit is not sanctioned or if the Air Force allotment is insufficient to cover the Air Force's immediate requirements for aircraft, then there is still some hope for British aircraft. In conversation with General FIR12 &gt; the Inspector General of the Air Force, the Air Attache was informed that a plan was already m being for the purchase of British aircraft should the American credit not go through. It is noU thought, however, that the Mesquite would in these circumstances be favoured, as the Persians are not confident that it will stand up as v^ell as a metal aircraft to tne country's climatic conditions. The fact that 'Iraq is re-equipping with Hawker Furies, which the Persians regard as a suitable aircraft, may influence them should they be in a position to place an order for British aircraft. 4. The Air Force is becoming increasingly anxious about the avail- ability of spares for its Hind and Audax aircraft. These aircraft are at present used exclusively for Army support in tribal operations, for v/hich they are ideally suited. Rec&gt;-ently the Air - Force has received a large pack—up of spares for the Mercury engines of these aircraft, but airframe spares are likely to become difficult if not impossible to obtain. In this connection, however, the R.A.F. has new returned most of the Teheran aircraft factory machine tools which were removed to the Middle East during the Har. fnce these have been reinstalled in the factory, it should be possible for the Air Force to manufacture many of their airframe spares and so overcome the present difficulty of supply. General Firuz realises that the Air Force's present state of low efficiency can only be improved by concentrating on training and /organisation- 2 - J organisation, and later to build up the •perational strength. h 3 )UM* the Shah however, would like to see a large operational Air Force, and as the Shah is likely to have his way, the Air Force’s efficiency is not likely to improve very rapidly.

Details of the equipment to be ordered for the Air Force have not yet been finally decided, but it is hoped to obtain further information from the Head of the American military Mission to the Persian Army. 2 , On the 16th the Air Attache visited the flying side of the F.T.S. at Doshan Tappeh. The observations on this visit should bo read in conjunction with para.7 of Summary l/48. ' Flying instruction takes place on alternative mornings at Doshan Tappeh. Although ten Tiger Mcths are available, owing to shortag'e of instructors and fear of congestion on the circuit, only six aircraft are used. An area in the centre of tho landing ground is kopt rolled, but the tail skids of the aircraft cut this up very quickly, with the result that the surface is rough. One instructor acts as Despatching Officer with a flag. Aircraft land on the right hand side of the area and take off on the loft, doing left-hand circuits at 600 feet. / ^ Colonel Bayandour, Chief of Staff, and Major Khatemi, O.C, F.T.S., accompanied the Air Attache. Major Khntomi is the only Persian officer to have successfully completed a Flying Instructor's Course in tho U.K. He stated that owing to tho poor rates of pay and conditions of se'rvico, it was extremely difficult to induce young men to join the Air Force. It was only after six months of advertising and canvassing that tho necessary 40 young direct entrants had boon found for tho present elementary course. Tho present entrants had only completed about eight years schooling, and difficulty was therefore being experienced in raising their educational standard to the pitch necessary for the teaching of tho school : s curriculum. Three University professors had boon loaned to the Air Force for this purpose. Tho ago limits for pupil pilots is 18 to 22 , but owing to tho general slackness in registering births, the dates given on ' identity oardswero not necossarily accurate, and an individual's ago could be inaccurate by months and perhaps even years without his definite knowledge. Tho general standard of Intelligence and physique of the pupils appeared to be good. They are accommodated, clothed and fed and should receive basic pay of 500 rials per month, with an additional 750 rials per month for flying. This latter figure, however, has recently boon reduced by the Ministry of Yiib.r to 450 per month, but in any case had not been paid for many months. This state of affairs is extremely unsatisfactory, as some of the pupils have to maintain families* 5 # of the 20 pupils present, about twelve had already gone solo after ton to fourteen hours dual instruction. This is considered reasonable, as pupils only receive an average of four or five hours instruction per week. From ground observation, tho general solo flying of the pupils appeared to be fair. The Air Attache made one circuit with a pupil who had complutod six hours solo flying, and tho following comments on his performance would appear to apply to most of the pupils. Few of them wore clear on tho sequence of action necessary for recovery from spins. Only two pupils had carried out spins with their instructors before going solo. General airmanship was poor. Pupils did not keep a good /lookout* ^ 1. ^ - 2 - lookout for other aircraft when to.xying, taking off and doing turns in the air. While tho piloting was positive and confident, pupils appeared to slip^ou on turns and did not maintain consistent height during tho circuit. The inaccuracy of tho flying instruments in aircraft, which apparently havo not boon thoroughly overhauled for many years does not tend to assist accurate flyit;,. 6 Tho general discipline and morale appeared to be good amongst the nunils. Tho same cannot be said for tho instructors. The Air Attache saw two instances of aircraft being loft unattended with engines running. On another occasion, an instructor climbed into a oockpit and signalled tho pupil to take off before ho had fastened his parachute and safety harness. 7 ^ During tho subsequent discussion with senior officers including the Acting Head of the Air Force, Colonel Guilanshah, it was stated that the chief difficulty arose from the shortage of qualified instructors. Of the nine instructors in the school, i&amp;jor Khatomi is tho only one who can be considered as fully qualified. Four others have been trained locally, while tho remaining four aro merely good pilots brought in from operational units. It would ^PP ca ^ that instructors were not generally keen on tho job, as theyhad to do a lot of flying and received no extra pay or other recognition for this type of work. It vrxs generally agreed that thoro was much room for improvement, but no urgent steps are being taken to remedy matters. 8 The C.G.S. has again asked whether O.T.IT. pilot training can bo undertaken in the U.K. if a^party of pilots is sent for elementary and advanced flying training. 9 Tho Hurricane Regiment carried out a total of about 1400 nours flying during 1947. Twenty pilots wore successfully converted on to Hurricanes by Wing Commander Gibbs, who also gave dual instruction to H.I.M. the Shah and a small number of senior officers who wished to fly the now aircraft. The year s flying wes completed without any fatal accidents or major write-offs. Several taxymg accidents occurred and throe forced landings. Two of these were duo to engine failure but in each case the pilot landed successfully back on the airfield. The third case was due to petrol shortage, but once again, the pilot landed successfully with wheels down in open country. The Persians aro generally satisfied with tho Hurricanes, and although recognising that they are now out dated by more modern aircraft, they realise that they have,and will piovo in valuable in acting as a step between their older aircraft and typos later than tho Hurricane. n q Throe Air Force .unsons have boon engaged in formation cross- country flights and familiarisation with provincial landing grounds. They are temporarily at Ahwaz. /PERSIA!!- 3 - Pi&amp;SJM CIVIL AVL^TION, DEPARTluUNT OF CIVIL AVIATION. / lo 'tNu ITth 'bho Minister of Coinnurniccitioris pevssod to tho 'pproprir.to Ending Coranittoo of tho Houso the proposed Civil Aviation Act.

EAGLE AIRLINE. 14 * Further to para. 6 of the last Summary, it is hoped to obtain the necessary sterling exchange permit before tho 27th. Until this permit has been obtained, no definite purchase of aircraft or spares can take place. IRANIAN AIRWAYS. lb# Internal ser/icos continue to be flown with fair regularity. During tho past two weeks, however, the Airline 1ms suffered several setbacks. One Dakota became bogged down at Shiraz and was eventually retrieved -with difficulty. On the 18th, tho Dakota flying to Ahwaz, when almost in sight of the landing ground, experienced low oil pressure and high temperatures on one engine. The pilob feathered the aiigcruw, but instead of landing at Ahwaz, tumod round and flew on one engine for noro than an hour and a half over oktrumely mountainous country, eventually making a successful landing at Teheran. His reason for this action was obviously that had he landed at Ahwaz, owing to the' lack of facilities there, tho aircraft might have boon grounded for a long period. This display of foresight was not appreciated by the passengers. 16 • ^ During the last few weeks a British firm has boon negotiating for tho purchase of five of this Company*s Dakotas. It is boliovod that the purchase price is five thousand pounds ofcich, that the Company wil 1 prepare tho aircraft for flight delivery to the U.K., but that the purchaser will provide the necessary aircrews. On tho night of tho 22/23rd, during a high wind, two of these aircraft wore blown into each other on tho ground and suffered severe damage. Apparently neither aircraft had been properly picicottod. GENERAL. 17. Hunting Aorosurvoys are making satisfactory progress with the air survey of areas in South Persia on behalf of tho Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Tho mild Winter has so far assisted them, and with luck, thoir total survey should bo completed by April. The Bristol Freighter used by them has boon thoroughly reliable, and dospite its size, has proved to bo fairly economical as all spares and photographic equipment can bo freely transported. The Anglo-lranian Oil Company continue to operate their four Rapides and one Dove. The second Dove is oxpocted back shortly from the U.K, after major overhaul. IB. The Air Attache flew the British Ambassador and party to Bushire and Abadan on the 19th, continuing to tho oil fields on tho 22nd. --0O0—BRITISH EMBASSY, TEHERAN — - ^ J 76 ( o (w) I ' Reference: 5/5/48 9th Liarch, 1948, AIR ATTACHED FORTNIGHTLY INTELLIGENCE SUmRY No, 5 . FORTNIGHT ENDING 7th FEBRUARY, 1948. SECRET PERSIAN AIR FORCE The meeting with General Grow, Head of the American Military Mission to the Persian Army, referred to in para.l of the last Summary, took place bn the 26th Februo.ry, The British Military Attache and Colonel Adams of the U,S,A*F, were also present. General Grow gave a brief' outline of the past work of his Mission and of plans for the immediate future. Although the ten million dollar credit has been sanctioned, agreement has not yet been reached on whether the Persian Government is to moot the packing and transport charges, variously qurited at between eight and fifteen million dollars. The Persians hope that Congress will approve the recommendations made by the late Ameri an Ambassador, that the Americans meet this additional expense. General Grow agreed that the Persian Air Force’s most urgent need is technical and flying training. To meet this need, the Persians will obtain elementary training aircraft and a large amount of technical training equipment for their technical and flying training schools. AboUt' 45 Thunderbolts will follow this equipment. To assist the Persians, four' U.S*A*F# officers and about ten technical N 6 C,Os will arrive with the equipment. 2. The flights of the Ansons referred to in para.10 of the last Summary had a further purpose. The General Staff anticipated trouble with the Qashqai tribes, and roinforcoments had been moved into the area with Bchbohan as the focal point. The Ansons made daily flights from Ahwaz over the tribal country to Shiraz, Bushiro and back. This display of ground and air might apparently had the desired effect. 3. Despite the large pack-up of spares which accompanied the Hurricanes, the Air Force has suddenly realised that unless certain engine and airframe spares can be obtained in the near future, the Hurricane Regiment will suffer heavy unservicoability. As they have boon informed that no Hurricane spares are available from the Middle East, they are expected to place the necessary orders through their Air Attache in London. 4. It is understood that the Persian .\ir Attache in London has asked for continuation courses for some of the trainees now in the United Kingdom, to enable the .vholo party to eventually return together. Some courses are only of 16 weeks duration, while others run to 42 weeks. Colonel Bayandor, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, has stated that to the best of his knowledge, this request for continuation courses has not been approved by the Ministry of r, nor is it likely to be, owing to the present rather tight-fisted policy. /PERSIAN CIVILE...PERSIAN CIVIL AV LIT ION D APART RANT OF CIVIL A V LIT ION 5. Mr. R. E. Vcryard, Senior Motoorological Offioor, H.Q. R.A.F., MED//'ME, arrived in Teheran on tho 1st and loft on tho 6 th. At tho invito.tion of the D.C.A. ho examined tho present meteorological sorvico and will submit recommendations to Air Ministry which have tho approval of Mr. Chafik, Dirootor-Gonorol of Civil Aviation. Ivlr. Voryard was greatly impressed by tho ability of Mrs. Arastoh, who is tho present Head of tho Meteorological Sorvico in Teheran. She is German by birth, was trained under Professor Bartels, and served with tho Luftwaffe during tho last war. Sho married a Persian in Berlin and is now settled in Teheran. 6 . When General Firuz attended tho I.C.A.O. Mooting at Montreal last September, he apparently requested I.C.A.O. to recommend individuals to advise tho D. C.A. in various capacities. I.C.A.O. consequently advised foreign Governments and at the same time informed certain individuals who have since submitted their names and qualifications to Mr. Chafik. This actioh on tho part of General Firuz has not the backing of tho Persian Government or Mr. Chafik. Whilo tho latter is seeking approval to engage foreigners, this has not yet been obtained, hnd the receipt of applications from abroad is therefore ambarassing. In any event, Mr. Chafik would prefer a one-nationality team of advisors, and ho still favours tho proposals put forward to him by International ALraclio’ For tho time being, however, ho is unable to proceed with the matter. 7. It is reported that the local authorities at Yozd have started work on a landing ground. There have been several efforts of this kind in the past two years, but they have usually fizzled out owing to lack of funds. EAGLE AIRLINE 8 ’. With tho sterling exchange permit in sight, and tho possibility of E. C.G.D. and B.O.A.C. guaranteeing tho Airline T s Bills, it would now appear that some of the Directors are not a tall anxious to proceed. It is believed that this is partly duo to political reasons and partly to tho fooling of uncertainty resulting from tho protracted negotiations. IRANIAN AIRWAYS 9 . After a few months of fairly regular flying to schedule, tho company has once again lapsed into almost complete unserviceability. One Dakota is believed to be in Karachi undergoing overhaul; a spare engine has had to be flown to another strandod in Cairo; a third is having an engine change in Teheran, and tho fourth and last is tho one which flow tho spare engine to Cairo. 10 . This aircraft recently undertook a charter flight to Now Delhi via Zahidan. It was also intended for a charter to Stockholm, but this has had to bo postponed. Mr. Ebtahaj, the Managing Director of .this Company, approached B.P. Aviation for a general 'credit note for tho flights of tho Company^ aircraft abroad. For tho time being, B.P. Aviation is only proparod to provide credit notes for individual flights, much to Mr. Ebtahaj’s chagrin. 11 . Now that Bandar Abbas landing ground has boon improved as forecast in previous Summaries, Iranian airways started a fortnightly service from Teheran to Bandar Abbas via Kerman. 12. For soma tin'o past, tho Company has been providing 2G minute joy-rides over Teheran every Friday. The charge has boon 100 rials per head. FOREIGN AIRLINES IISL FRANCE 13.

AA/35/6A#. 24th Marca, 1948 AIR ATTACHE'S FORTNIGHTLY INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY No. 6 . FORTNIGHT ENb ING 21st MARCH, 194 8. PERSIAN AI R TORCH 1. Brigadier MOHANNA, who has been on various Staff courses in France, for the last 18 months, returned on the 16th. His arrival a week before the Persian New Year with its usual promotions and reshuffling of appointments, is significant, as it is not yet clear whether a new Head of the Air Force is to be nominated. 2. The Persian New Year holidays started on Saturday, 20th March and most people will not return to work until the following Saturday. 3. Colonel BAYANDOR stated on the 21st that he was expecting a busy time finding pilots for the members of the Royal Family who were planning to visit different parts of the country during the holidays. This is probably the first occasion upon which so many members of the Royal Family have become air- minded at the same time. 4 . ihe usual Levee was held at the Gulistan Palace on the 21st March on the occasion of the Persian New Year. PE RSIAN CIVIL AVIATION DEP ARTMEN T OF CIV IL A VIATION 4 . it is reported that a temporary landing ground has been constructed at RAMS/P , the holiday resort on the Caspian Coast. For the time being its dimensions are not more than 450 yards square, and it is therefore only suitable for very light aircraft. 5 . The Civil Aviation Act being studied by a committee of the Majlis, as reported in para.2 of Summary No.4, is not yet ready for presentation to the Majlis. 6 . At the beginning of the month, the Persian Government received c request from the Czechoslovakian Government for permission to operate a civil air service to Teheran from Prague, via Rome, Athens, Lydda and Baghdad. The R;rsian Government is fully aware of the implications of a Czech service operating through the Middle East, especially Palestine, at this moment, and whilst it cannot withold permission for specific flights, it is not likely to grant clearance for a regular service. On this point the Persian Cover onent is able to state with truth that no air transport agreements have yet been concluded with any foreign country. EAGLE AIRLINE 7 . The necessary import licenses have now been obtained, and after the Persian Nov/ Year holidays are over no difficulty is expected in securing the exchange permit which has for so long held up the negotiations. If the lukewarm members of the board of this airline withdraw their support, it is expected that the remaining directors will carry on. IRANIAN AIRWAYS 8 . Mr. G.H. E3TAHAJ, Managing Director, called upon the British Ambassador and attempted once again to seek support for his oft expressed conviction that the starting up of Eagle Airlines would be detrimental to his Company and to Eagle Airlines, but that his resources, both convcntionaM and unconventional, would eventually break Eagle Airlines. He also claimed that tne Dove is /unsuitableunsuitable for Persia, and even went so far as to state that while he might be prepared to reconsider a merger, it would only be on condition that Doves were not acquired by Eagle Airlines. Several other points.ihe made were equally /dde oi tne mark, and it is quite evident tinat he is becoming ihefoasingly anxious now that the many difficulties which have so far prevented the setting up of Eagle Airlines appear to have been overcome. Mr. Nicholl of Scottish Aviation is now in Teheran to accept the five Dakotas which are to be sold to his firm. At a very early stage in negotiations he ran up against difficulties in the interpretation by Iranian Airways of what they considered to be an 'airworthy' aircraft fit for ferrying to the U.K. This point, together with the fact that only one of the five aircraft is anywhere near ready for flight, as well as financial difficulties, makes it doubtful \/hether the transaction will go through in the near future, if at all. 10. Two of the ex Persian Air Force pilots who have been flying as co pilots for the last 18 months have now been made Captains of Aircraft, although they hold no internationally recognised licenses. Instances have already occurred of Persian passengers not wishing to fly in aircraft captained by one of their own race, despite the fact that the two pilots in question are reliably considered to be capable as good-weather Captains on internal services. FOREI GN AIRLI NES _B._0_._A* C. 11* It is believed that B.O.A.C. is shortly to start a once weekly York charter service from the U.K. to Abadan on behalf of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Previously a similar charter service was operated by Skyways, who may still be required should the passenger traffic prove too heavy for the B.O.A.C. charter service. BRAATHENS NORl/E GIilN A IR SERVICE 12. The service reported in para. 15 of the last Summary has not materialised. It is understood that owing to the lack of Persian Consular representatives in Norway, visa difficulties have made operation of a regular service temporarily impracticable. CZE CH A IRLINE 13. See para. 6 above. IRAQI AIRWAYS 14. On the 18th this airline increased its service from once to twice weekly. Flights are made from Baghdad to Teheran and return on Mondays and Thursdays, using Viking aircraft. K.L.M. 15* It is understood that K.L.M. intend in May to operate a weekly service to Thheran via Amsterdam, Rome, Athens, iStanbul and Baghdad. GENER AL 16. On the 9th, Consul G-AJLL operated by Chart air Limited arrived in Teheran from Basra, on a charter flight carrying Middle East representatives of the Ford Motor Company.
