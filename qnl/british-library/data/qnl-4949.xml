NO. 501 INTEL. 14th December, 1948 CONFIDENTIAL. My Intel No. 438 of 30th October EIRE AT P THE CCiUXNVv-ALTH fte are anxious to avoid publicity regarding situation' created by repeal by Eire Governent of External Relations Act and by United Kingdom Prime Minister's announcement in House of Commons on 25th November that His Majesty's Government in the Unitea Kingdom do not propose as a result of this repeal to regard Eire as a 'foreign' country. If questioned however, you may make following points:- (i) Eire Government's action in repealing Act, however much we may regret it from point of view of sentiment and of possible use which our detractors may make of it in their propaganda, in fact regularises a situation which had been long anomalous and unreal. (ii) Eire Government have stressed Eire's friendly feeling towards United Kingdom and other Cor monvealth Nations and their desire for even closer relations than at present. These sentiments have been echoed by United Kingdom and other Commonwealth (iii) Mr. Costello announced during Dail debate on second reading of 'Republic of Ireland 1948' Bill on 24th November that Eire Government intended, first, as . and when Commonwealth Countries granted Eire citizens recognition and rights, to make orders under the Nationality and Citizenship Act giving their citizens comparable rights (so far as the United Kingdom is concerned the conditions stated willbe fullilled when the British Nationality Act 1948 comes into force on 1st January, 1949). This will continue the long standing practice in Eire, whereby, on a basis of reciprocity, citizens of Commonwealth countries are exempted from treatment as aliens. At a later stage, and the Eire Government hope this will be in the near future, the Eire Government will undertake Full and friendly understanding as to future relations with Eire was reached during a meeting in Paris on Governments a comprehensive review of their Nationality Law so as to make statutory provision for the grant of rights and privilages in Eire to citizens of Commonwealth countries. (The point at this second sta^ is that the privilages will, subject of course to r reciprocity, be placed on a statutory basis and will not depend on an order made at discretion). 16th November16th November between Eire Ministers and Ministers representing the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the four Commonwealth countries in which there are the largest communities of Irish origin. The Governments of all the other Commonwealth countries and the Government of Northern Ireland were also consulted in advance of the Prime Minister's statement on 25th November. 2. As regards possibility that nations having treaties with United Kingdom containing most-favoured-nation clauses may claim the same treatment as the United Kingdom accords to Eire or the right to form similar relationships themselves with other foreign countries, position for your confidential information is that it was agreed with Eire ministers during Paris discussions that Eire Government would collaborate with United Kingdom Government and any other interested Commonwealth Governments in resisting any such claims. Grounds on which this resistance would be based have not yet been finally determined, but general line of argument would probably be:- (a) The United Kingdom and Eire stand in a relationship to one another which is quite unlike the i^lationship in which either stands to any foreign country. This special relationship consists in ties of kinship, geographical proximity, and long association. (b) In making present arrangements neither country is granting the other any new privileges but is merely maintaining the status quo. (c) Since His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have declared that they do not regard Eire as a 'foreign' country or her citizens as 'foreigners', any benefits or privileges which the United Kingdom may continue to grant to Eire or her citizens cannot legitimately be claimed by any country which is foreign to the United Kingdom. 3. In this connection, following extract from Mr. Costello's speech in the Dail on 24th November may be useful: '...the position of the Irish Government is, that while Ireland is not a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, it regognizes and confirms the existence of a specially close relationship, arising not only from ties of friendship and kinship, but from traditional and long-established economic, social and trade relations based on common interest with the nations that form the British Commonwealth. This exchange of rights and privilage$, which it is our firm desire and intention to maintain and strength€ in our view constitutes a special relationship which negatives the view that other countries could raise valid objections on the grounus that Ireland should be treated as a 'foreign' country by Britain and the Commonwealth Countries, for the purpose of this exchange of rights and privilages'.INDIA OFFICE RECORDS ~</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000023_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/642</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000023</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/642</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 25/8 Eire and the Commonwealth’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1948/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-04-16T11:19:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
