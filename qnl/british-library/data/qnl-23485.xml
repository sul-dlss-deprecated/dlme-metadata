On the 1st of April lytyj tlie Secretary of State for Air by an order made uaJer Section 7 of the Air Navigation Act 1920 required the Corporation to place the whole of lis undertaking at hie disposal an4 fran r -.fc date all the air services operated by the Oorparatffeft have been carried out in complianoe with the Secretary of Stated directions* From that dale also a large proportion of the fleet of aircraft, buildings and equipment used by the Corporation are directly owned by H .LI. Government these having been allocated to ihe Corporation for the express purpose of oaintaining the communications required by the Secretary of State. The operations of the Corporation are financed by H.M.Treasury and the Corporation accounts to the Secrebaxy of State for Air for all revenue and expenditure in oonnecticn with the services* Traffic carried by the Corporation is determined by H.M.Government which has exclusive control over priorities etc. 9 and to a preponderous extent the loads o .insist of passengers and goods of a military or official character. Fran the foregoing it will be seen that the Corporation is in no sense a oommeroial undertaking and that it operates as a service of H.M.Government. % In a dition , i - 1 ' ' ' mS JBRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION &amp;ACHI.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to letter No .NAD. 323.1608 dated 6th September, 1944, addressed by you to the Direotor of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain Government, in which you requested exemption from Customs duties on stores and equipment imported by the Corporation into Bahrain on the grounds that the Corporation is now controlled by His Majesty^ Government and operates as a Government service. Sxemption from Customs duties on aircraft equipment etc. was granted by the ShaiJch of Bahrain under the Civil Air Agreement made between him and the British Government on Ist January, 1942. The period of the Agreement was for seven years. Exemp tion from Customs duties was granted in respect of certain specified imports which are fully described in the Agreement. When the Civil Air Agreement was made the British Overseas Airways Corporation had for almost two years been under thi disposal of the Secretary of State for Air. No special exemption from Customs duties on imports by the British Over seas Airways Corporation was demanded or granted at that time. The Bahrain Government is aware that air traffic is controlled by the Secretary of State for Air in the same way that shipping is controlled by the Ministry of War Transport. The Bahrain Government is not however prepared to agree that because the British Overseas Airways Corporation is now under Government control it should therefore be exempted from normal Customs duties upon goods which are imported by the Corporation into Bahrain.
