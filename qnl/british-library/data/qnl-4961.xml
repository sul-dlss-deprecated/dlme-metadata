C/408-1.a/31 of 10th September. 1. Hews of the incident arrived in a few papers from Iraq, quite soon after it took place but apparently few people saw the paper. It is said here that the Persian captain took down the flag, stampea on it and then tore it into pieces, fhe Arabs regard insults to flags quite as seriously as Western people and they all consider tiiat this was intended as an open insult and defiance to England. Hobody believes it possible that the captain of the ship acted without orders from his Government. 2. When the circulars were issued the Persians held a meeting in theiZ- school ostensibly to discuss school affairs but I am told on good authority that it was to discuss the flag incident. I have not been able to find out what conversation took place. 3. The chief comments I have heard from Arabs and Bahama and from the Shaikhs is that the British Government has been much too lenient in the matter and would have acted differently in oti^er days, huey are all very surprised that the Government took no stronger action and say that by letting the Persians off so lightly this time they are laying up trouble for the future, they think that next time the Persians will do something more drastic to show how little they regard the English. One or two people have suggested that the Russians are aJbcfck in some way responsible for the incident. The British note and the Persian reply conveys nothing to the Arabs who, in Bahrain, are not at all conversant with diplomatic methods. It is possiule that I shall hear some more within a few days in which case l will let you know.Telegram:- - R/27. No:- 427. Dated:- 17th September 1933. Prom: - Political Bahrain.

After some time in politics it was ascertained that they have engaged themselves/and joined hand with the Arab Rulers of these parts^ especially Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Has al Khaimah, prior to his proceed ing to h a iba. Shaikh Sultan sent to ^ebaijon his behalf, a priest who interviewwed these two individuals, Mirza and Ghulam. ^hey were # consulting each other for a long time and making all sorts of promises. Mirza Mahmud promised them to go to Aig^ire as a Representative of Shaikh Sultan, and undertook to help him in effecting a secret treaty between him and^Iranian Government. He impressed upon them that they will be treated in a harsh and violent manner by the British Government. « \\ £he poor Shaikhs of the Coast, will be misled by a slight promise which is given to them by such people. He (Mirza Mahmud) has also given them an extract of the important part of the Iranian Agreement with the Oil Company at Abadan so that they may use it and be strict about it. H e communicates all news concerning smuggling of goods and ofcher matters to his Government 1 One of his friends at ^ahrain sent him copies of notices whifah were issued some time ago at Bahrain about the sale of property belonging to foreign subjects and he forwarded them at once oo Bush ire. «dien they discovered that some people have come to Know aoout their activities they were frightened, though frhey were doing good business, and decided to leave the place at once, fhey left for Bushire two months ago. Their letters have recently been received here to the effect that they will shortly arrive at Debai and engage themselves in politico! affairs. They are enemies and harmful people. If you do not -vant them to land at Debai you should now issue orders prohibiting their landing because if they land the Shaikhsmight not allow them to leave again as they have heard many lies from them.

I made enquiries but was not able to discover that Mirza Mahmud was mixing with the Shaikhs in political matters. During the last five years Mirza Mahmud and his relative Ghulam Husain come to Dubai for few months and then return to Iran. There is no proof against him that he was working for the Iranian authorities except that he was talking highly of the Iranians the fact which one hears from each Iranian. 3. There is no one by name 'Abdul Majid Hindi* here The hand writing of the report is exactly like that of Rashid bin Bati bin Rashid nephew of Shaikh Mani* bin Rashid of Dubai while the Arabic ' Abdul Majid Hindi * looks like the handwriting of one of Kanu's clerks in Bahrain. It is possible that this is one of the various propaganda carried by Kanu and Shaikh Mani with the 4. object of creating trouble. return the letter in original. Residency Agent,SharjahSECRET D.O. Mo. C/431 - l.a/31 Dated the S3rd 1940. As you may Imagine the events of the past few weeks have not been without thair effect here in Bahrain. The Ruling Family are as loyal as ever and they and I are satisfied with the attitude of the Arabs and Bahama^ but thare is no doubt that the 'Persians' (the Holis), who have always been pretty d^sloyel, have been elated by the German successes and have been talking quite a lot about inevitable German victory. This has caused a certain amount of uneasiness and this morning Shaikh Abdullah came to see me about it. While he said he was satisfied that the Holis had no arms and in any case were not fighting men he thought that there ought to be some increase in the strength of the Bahrain Governments forces* and in general his idea was to strengthen the gangs of Fidawis attached personally to Shaikh Hamad and the various Senior Shaikhs.

There is otoly one effective way of getting these people on ones side, and that is to have friendly pleasant relations with them. The Holis have, for the most part, been good friends of the Agency in the past, and have given us a good deal of support in the reforms that we have initiated. 1 am sorry to hear that their attitude has deteriorated.

If the situation deteriorates further ± shall come over to Bahrain myself and see what can be done. 1 cannot remember any holis giving serious trouble before, and it would be disastrous if we antagonised the whole community by such a step as deportations. 4. I agree that there is no case for increasing the Shaikhs' gangs of Ridawis.

With e warning of this sort, I see good reason to hope that the situation will not deteriorate here. Two recent local events have Deen encouraging. In the first, two Persians were arrested by the Police on the allegation that they had declared openly that the Germans would soon defeat Ingland as they had defeated France -nd would shortly occupy London, ' J/ that the British would be thrown out of Bahrain and so on. Witnesses were afraid to depose in open Court so I have settled this matter by melting the two accused take oath publicly in the mosques (one is a Shi a* chid the other a ounni) that they never either thought or said such a thing ana calling God’s curse on themselves if they do so in future. Of course the oath means very little; but the general effect is good and already I hear from more than one source that this /- The Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel C. G. Prior, C.X.B*, Political Kcsident in the Persian Gulf, Bush!re.this kind of talk has dininished. The second was the removal of two Indians employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company who had been talking against the British. They were dismissed and repatriated in accordance with the terms of their contract and I have given the Bombay Police particulars about the worse one of the two so that he can be watched in India. Again there are immediate reports of a far better tone. I hasten to adu that Inaians in Bahrain are extremely loyal in general as they have proved by offers of service, collections of money and so on. 4. A word about the Holis. I am afraid there is little doubt that for several years past the attituae of the Holis in general has been deterror&lt;..ting. Whether this is due to any semi-officially organised effort to spread Persian Nationalist propaganda here is not entirely clear, but there is good reason to believe that for a long t^me reports have b en sent to officials in Persia on public feeling in Bahrain. Though the Holis are Bahrain subjects (in aceorG t .nce with the Bahrain nationality ha?/) they have by no means been denied the favour of the Agency in the past two or three years. They continue to feature prominently at Agency gatherings; I have two of them on my Radio Listen rs* Committee; I have ensured their representation on the Malaria Committee and have gone out of my way to help individuals on various occasions, nevertheless there is not the least doubt that they wvre mainly responsible for the agitation in 1^58 ana with a few notable exceptions it is impossible to discern in them nowadays any feelings of loyalty either to us or to the Bahrain Government. 5. As I have saia, I have plenty of hope that a simple warning will be all that is needed here. Even so it would be unwise to ignore the possibility of unpleasant events inin - 3 - the Near East with attendant repercussions down our way, and I venture to suggest that we snouid be prepared to take instant and effective action whenever necessary.

Very soon after I wrote that letter there was a con siderable improvement in the situation here. The action taken in making the two Persians take oath (vide paragraph 3 of oy letter), tne removal of two rather dangerous Indians, a very useful •Alan issued by the Bahrain Government tnreatening heavy punishment to 'persons spreading news or making state ments by speech or in writing likely to c&lt;use public feeling against the Allies', all had admirable results* At the same time I started a sort of whispering campaign from the Agency on the following lines: 'Persons who spread disloyal rumours are Fifth Columnists'; 'Fifth Columnists are traitors'; 'Trsitorsi are liable to be shot in wartime'. The jf^esult has been that undesirable majlises are empty and people who know that they are under suspicion are walking with the utmost delicacy. 3. After further consultation with Belgrave and the Shaikhs and also with young Shaikh Khalifah, I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer necessary to hold a meeting or to issue a puDlic warning; nd I propose to hold this course in reserve in case there is any deterioration later.
