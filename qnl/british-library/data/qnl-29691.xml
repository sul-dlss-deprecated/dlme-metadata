The installation of a 4 rt regulator valve to relieve excess gas to waste in ,he event of a sudden pressure increase on the gas feed line was the only addition to ;he plaint equipment made during the year. Mork was started on the installation of additional caustic handling facilities required to increase the capacity of the existing recovery equipment which will be used for recovering caustic returned from various other plants connected with the new facilities. DEHYDRATOR This unit operated normally during the year as required for recovery of the slop oil production. LIME KILN The nominal capacity of this plant is 5.7 tons per day. Operation during the year was intermittent, being scheduled as necessary to handle requirements. No altera tions were made to the plant during the year. STEAM-JET REFRIGERATION PLANT This plant operated part of the year refrigerating the Refinery drinking waternd ^yplying cold water to the Laboratory air conditioning system. Changes made onsisted of the installation of an additional condenser for the Jets and the replaoe- ent of the make-up precooler with a more efficient unit. ABORATOKT In order to house the testing equipment necessary for the control of the new viation gasoline plants, extensive alterations to the Laboratory were completed during he year. These alterations consisted of the complete rearrangement of the interior of he existing building and the erection of an additional Laboratory to house the octane eating equipment. This building is an extension, and includes a part, of the old xygen plant building. ITRA TERMINAL AND WHARF Alterations and additions made at the Terminal to facilitate handling aviation asoline and increased volumes of other products were as follows:- 1. New ethylizing facilities for motor gasoline. This equipment, the instal lation of which was started in 1943 and completed during this year, consists of a new building housing an 8,500 gallon ethyl weigh drum installation and a storage platform with 300 drums capacity. 2. Dye pot for dyeing gasoline. 3. New 5»000 barrel per hour aviation gasoline shipping pump. 4. Extensive additions to the tank farm lines and the pumphouse manifold system. 5. New 12' aviation gasoline loading line to the Wharf. 6. Extensions to both the pumphouse and the control room to house the addi tional pumps and control instruments. 7. New transformer substation necessary to handle the increased power requirements at the Terminal. 8. Additional tankage, the details of which are given under the heading 'Tankage &amp; Lines' in the new plants section of this report. 9. A pump and loading rack were installed to load 100 octane gasoline into tank trucks for transportation to Muharraq. This gasoline is imported and held in storage in Tank No.921, which, together with one of the loading lines, is leased to the Air Ministry. At the Loading Wharf the only additions made consisted of the installation of le new 12' loading line mentioned above. However, extensive repairs were made to thewharf structure the berthing of £ and the structure SALT WATER SYSTEM Units ir purposes. The ec water consist of November:- 1. 2 . 3.

Repairs were complete by the end of the year and the structure is again in good condition. B - NEW PLANT COMPLETED OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN 1944 SALT WATER SYSTEM Units in the new facilities are being supplied with sea water for cooling purposes. The equipment to handle the required quantities of incoming and outgoing sea water consist of the following units which were placed in operation during October and » November:- 1. A low head pumping plant having a nominal capacity of 75*000 g.p.m., situated south of the Refinery and on the end of a raised flume which extends from the shore approximately 2,000 feet out to sea. The water is discharged into this flume and flows to the shore where it is conducted by means of an open canal to the Refinery. 2. A high head pumping plant of similar capacity located at the other end of the open canal which terminates near the southern boundary of the Refinery. The incoming sea water is pumped by this plant into a buried reinforced concrete pipe distributing system with branches running to the various refinery units. 3. A separator system to remove oil from all used water leaving the Refinery and an open canal running parallel to the inlet water canal, which discharges that water into the sea. NO,3 CRUDE UNIT A new three stage crude unit having a nominal capacity of 25,000 barrels per day was completed and placed in operation in November. The unit consists of atmospheric and vacuum main towers each equipped with a separate furnace and miscellaneous product strippers; the main overhead gasoline stream is rerun in a separate column. The princi pal products are light and heavy gasoline, kerosene, light and intermediate diesel, a heavy gas-oil cut for charging to the new catalytic cracking unit and residuum. All products have separate l*. es, punns, etc., for discharge to storage or to the next unit for subsequent processing.''^Vn HRiruS GAS KBC0VT51 A new vi led to process a consists of an e for the removal The principal pi gasoline manufac part of October construction are NO.2 POWER PLAN*] A new ] meet steam requi each having a n&lt; addition, a 3,0&lt; boiler was comp end of the year BUTANE ISOMERIZ An iso operating day, nearing ooraplet forming pure no surge drums, wa It is ALKYLATION UNP] An all17 - mjL r.RTTuB GAS RECOVERY PLANT A new unit incorporating the former straight run gasoline stabilizer was instal led to process all of the gas and light gasoline from the three crude stills. This unit consists of an engine driven compressor to handle the gas, miscellaneous caustic scrubbers for the removal of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans and a two stage stabilization system. The principal plant products are debutanized light gasoline, a butane cut for aviation gasoline manufacture and fuel gas. This unit went into operation during the latter part of October but will not function to maximum advantage until the plants now under construction are operating. WO.2 POWER PLANT A new power plant is under construction in the south part of the refinery to meet steam requirements of the new facilities. This unit consists of two Riley boilers, each having a nominal output of 80,000 Ibs/hr. of 550 Ibs/sq.in. superheated steam. In addition, a 3,000 K.W. generator will be installed at this plant during 1945. One boiler was completed during November and the other was substantially complete as of the end of the year. BOTANS ISOMERIZATION UNIT An isomerization unit designed for a nominal capacity of 1,100 barrels per operating day, equivalent to 880 barrele per calendar day, waa under construction and nearing completion as the year ended. This plant will employ catalytic means for trans forming pure normal butane into Isobutane. The plant consists primarily of numerous surge drums, washing, contacting and super-fractionating towers. It is anticipated that this plant will be placed in operation during January 1945 ALKYLATION UNIT An alkylation unit utilizing the cold sulfuric acid process was nearingcompletion on De 3,750 barrels of calendar day.

This plant is designed for a nominal capacity of 3,750 barrels of butene alkylate per operating day, equivalent to 3,000 barrels per calendar day. It will process all of the butene olefin fractions recovered from thermal cracking and reforming and catalytic cracking sources and combine those materials with isobutane from the isomerization unit to produce a crude alkylate which is subsequently rerun and treated to produce finished alkylate for blending to finished 100 octane aviation gasoline. In order to provide cooling necessary to permit operating the alkylation plant at the required low temperature, a compressor house containing equipment for the production of about 1,600 tons/day refrigeration is being built and this is nearly completed. It is anticipated that this plant will be placed into operation during February 1945. NEW ACID MANUFACTURING AND RgCOTBKT FACILITIES The alkylation process uses sulfuric acid and this involved a requirement oft (1) new acid exceeding the capacity of the present 20-ton manufacturing plant and, (2) equipment to recover the spent alkylation acid. Accordingly, acid manufacturing equip ment having a nominal capacity of 35 tons I^SO^ per stream day is being provided consisting of increasing the 20-ton plant to 25 tons plus the building of a new 10-ton plant along with acid recovery facilities. The acid recovery facilities being installed have a capacity of 123 tons per stream day. This equipment was subs taint ially complete as of the end of the year. ALTERATIONS TO POLYMER PLANT OLEFIN PREPARATION AND CAUSTIC REGENERATING EQUIPMENT Preliminary fabrication auad foundation work in connection with the alterations of these plants for use in conjunction with the new facilities have been completed andle balance of the work Is awaiting a plant shutdown. This shutdown Is dependent on the jmpletion dates of the alkylation and isomerization units but is anticipated during the itter part of January 1945. jUID CATALYTIC CRACKING PLANT A two stage fluid catalytic cracking unit is being built for the primary purpose T producing the aromatic base stock necessary for the production of 100 octane aviation isoline. This unit will have a nominal charging capacity of 12 t 000 barrels per stream ly and produce about 3,500 bbls./day of finished aromatic blending stock. The remaln- ig products will consist of a light and a heavy cycle gas oil which will be used in te production of diesel and fuel oils. At the present time it is exacted that this unit will be completed Suid ready &gt;r operation about April 1945. lS concentratioh unit for thk fluid catalytic cracking uhit This plant in reality is the recovery, stabilization and rerun section for the .uid catalytic cracking unit. It will serve the same function for the catalytic ‘acker light ends as the altered polymer plant will serve for light ends from thermal ‘asking and reforming units. All the fixed gases produced by the catalytic cracker will be processed though rarpressors housed in an extension to the same building containing the alkylation plant &gt;frigerating compressors. The function of this unit is to recover all the hydrocarbon •actions which are capable of further processing. The equipment consists of some ,600 H.P. of compressor capacity to handle the gas production together with absorbers, iabilizers and seven fractionating columns each equipped with its own furnace. At the present time, it is expected that this unit will be completed at about te same time, or slightly in advance of, the fluid catalytic cracking unit./'\ aviation acid tr The oon present aoid tre 1 plant Is deslgne bbls./day.

The plant is expected to be ready for operation by May 1945* CENTRAL CAUSTIC DISSOLVING PLANT This plant is substantially a duplication of similar equipment now installed near the present transfer pumphouse which is only sufficient to handle present needs. The new plant has been located in an area close to the points of caustic consumption and adjacent to the area chosen for locating the lead sulfide treating plants, thereby centralizing operations of a similar nature. This plant construction is well advanced and should be completed in February 1945* LEAD SULFIDE TREATING PLANTS One new lead-sulfide treating plant is being provided as a part of the new facilities. This plant is now nearing completion and will be ready for operation when required. It is designed to sweeten 1,500 bbls/day of a marginal blend stock prepared by de-normal pentanizing a special cut of light straight run gasoline. In connection with No.2 Reformer which will be constructed during 1945* a new reformed gasoline PbS plant of increased capacity (14,000 bbls/day) will be installed and a small amount of work has already been done on the foundations. AVIATION QASOLINE ETHYLIZING AND INHIBITING PLANTS The installation of an 8,500 gallon capacity ethyl weigh drum and contingent equipment is being made to facilitate the handling of ethyl fluid and the ethylizing of aviation gasoline blends. The building in which this equipment is housed incorporates ahaded area sufficient to store about 300 drums of Ethyl fluid. The gasoline inhibitor plant is installed under the same roof in a separately nolosed corner of the building. It consists of space and equipment to empty special gum nhibitors into blowoase equipment where a concentrated solution of the inhibitor in I asoline will be prepared for subsequent addition to aviation gasoline blends in specified oncentrations. The construction of both of these items is well advanced and should be completed n ample time for use when required. I3CgLLAireOU8 P01IPH0U3SS Two pumphouse additions within the Refinery were provided to handle the additional umping load imposed by the new facilities: 1. The present so called 'sweet gasoline' pumphouse was amplified by four pumps of 500-750 HPH capacity to take care of the transfer of catalytic cracker feed stock and light and heavy cycle gas oil produced. 2. A special pumphouse located adjacent to the aviation gasoline Ethyl Building was installed to take care of aviation blend stock transfers and blending operations. All finished blends will then be pumped to finished storage at Sitra. Both the foregoing pumphouses are complete and ready for operation.

The principal electric feeder lines are complete and in service except for ditional changes and additions which will be made at the time the new generator, to be stalled at No.2 Power Plant, is placed into operation. A new refinery telephone system with an independent switchboard has been installed i is now operating. Part of the telephones to the new plants are in operation and the nainder will be completed in the near future. A chilled, distilled drinking water system has been completed with the exception connections to various plants now under construction. Sanitary sewer services have been installed and a part of these are now in operation. JJING AND MACHINE SHOPS The extent and nature of the new equipment now being installed has necessitated the rchase of machine tools not heretofore available at Bahrein. Buildings to house such lipment are being built in the northeast of the refinery area. The framework of one .Iding is up and the other is in the process of erection. It is anticipated that both .Idings will be completed during the first half of 1945.

Two additions were made to Messhall building and an addition was made to the Construction Office, both of which east of the Acid Manufacturing Plant. Three Staff Toilets, one east of the Acid ifacturing Plant, one east of the Alkylation Unit and one east of the Fluid Catalyst iking Plant, and two Native Toilets, one north of the Acid Manufacturing Plant and south of the Fluid Catalyst Cracking Plant, were built. iLxNE - ARABIA TO BAHREIN ISLAND Completed this year as a part of the Refinery expansion program was a 12' crude line running across Bahrein Island from the Refinery to a point on the shoreline ng Arabia. At this point, junction is to be made with a 12' submarine line, now in process of being laid, which will carry crude oil from Arabia. The transportation of e oil through these lines is expected to start during the early part of 1945. In unction with this project, an oiled road has been built which follows the entire th of the land section of the pipe line. MANUFACTURING PLANT A drum manufacturing plant having a theoretical maximum capacity of 70,000 drums month (basis 3 shift operation) was built and placed on a preliminary operating basis, caber of equipment items, which have not yet arrived, are still to be installed before plant will be complete. At year's end the plant was still operating in what should be termed the experimental e. Realization of full capacity probably will not occur until sometime in March or 1 1945. FILLING PLANT Drum filling facilities are being installed and include two 25,000 barrel stock 9 and a small slop tank.

The new causeway runs along the south side and parallel to the sea lines to a ioint approximately 13,000' off shore where a pierhead will be built to handle 4 barges ilmultaneously in 8* deep water at mean low tide. It is anticipated that this causeway will be ready for use about June 1945. CAMP FACILITIES ■WALI A 52 room bunkhouse, complete with washroom and toilets and nine 24-room bunk- ouses were built during the year. These were necessary for housing the construction force ow in Bahrein and on the completion of the construction project these bunkhouses will be onverted for other uses. Additions and alterations were made to the Awall Messhall to provide messing acilities for the present manpower and for the number of employees anticipated in the uture; additional dining room and kitchen space has been provided. The mail office, which previously was included in the Main Office, has been amoved and a separate building constructed. The new building houses the mail office, technical library and a records room. The growing Company facilities which necessitate increased personnel, have made be existing main office inadequate. Alterations and additions have therefore been- 25 - jommenoed to provide more office space. The existing Laundry building has been extended to provide more laundry space, ilso, a dry cleaning room was added. A third A.C. plant and cooling tower was built to provide air cooling for further &gt;ffices and industrial buildings and for the construction bunkhouses. A portion of this trill be available for future housing. The 13 new air conditioned family-type houses which were commenced in 1943 were &gt;ompleted; all were built with three bedrooms. LAFFA An increase in the number of non—staff Company personnel employed at present and inticipated in the future has necessitated extensions to the housing facilities provided 'or these employees. At the Raffa Camp four 14-room 'Rupees Contract Daily' Employees luarters were built, together with two combination kitchen and servants quarters and two rashrooms and toilets. Four 'Rupees Non-Contract Daily' Employees quarters, two kitchens ind one washroom and toilet were also constructed. &gt;ITRA Additions are being made to the 'Rupees Non-Contract Daily' Employees quarters at litra Pier which house the marine personnel. Under construction are two living quarters, i combination kitchen and servants quarters and a toilet. LANDS Reservation for the Arablan-Bahrein Pine Line. UR-22 : On March 25, 1944 the Company applied for a reservation of land from the Bahrein Government for the installa tion and maintenance of the Arabia-Bahrein pipe line. The reserva tion, containing approximately 110 acres, consists of a hundred foot wide strip from the boundary of the Company Reservation GR-1A near the Refinery to the high tide line on the west coast of Bahrein, except that where it crosses private property the strip of land was decreased to 50 feet in width.grantee Company and owi chased June 5- 26 - The reservation, as far as State lands was concerned, was granted on December 14-, 194 . 4 . Pitch Pond Property, F-9: This property of 143.32 acres, on which part of the Company’s pitch ponds are situated, is divided into 120 shares and owned by the Abdullah-al-Ghatam family. The Company pur chased the 26 share interest of Issa-bin-Ahmed al Ghatam on June 5, 1944.

Yours sincerely, R.T.Peel ^s^., M.C India Office, Whitehall, 3&gt;.l. Bnds1943 ANNUAL REPORT INTRODUCTION: The activities of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited on Bahrein Island during the year 1943 are briefly reviewed in this report. Tabulatlona are presented, showing: ID the status of all oil, gas and water wells as at December 31, 1943, (2) the purpose, size and type of all buildings standing as at December 31, 1943, (3) the nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity in the service of the Company at Bahrein as of December 31, 1943, and (4) the monthly oil production and daily average water production by months during the year under review. The locations of wells, camps, pump stations, pipe lines, roads and other mis cellaneous facilities are shown on the attached map. FIELD DEVELOPMENT &amp; WELL REPAIR DEVELOPMENT: No work of a development nature has been undertaken during the year. In November the Company applied for permission to rehabilitate a certain number of the walls which in 1942 were eliminated as a security measure designed to deny oil to the enemy in the event of a deterioration in the war situation; this per mission was granted by both the Military and Political Authorities with the proviso that denial measures win be revived if the military situation necessitates such action. Preliminary work, in connection with the return to production of those wells which are necessary to Improve the distribution of withdrawal from the reservoir and for the observe- tion of essential data, has been undertaken and carried as far as available personnel will permit; however, because of the specialized nature of rehabilitation, work beyond the preliminary stages can not be started until the necessary trained men are obtained. REPAIR; The unsatisfactory mechanical condition which was detected in one producing well during the year was rectified. This unsatisfactory condition is attributed in part to corrosion, and repair Jobs of this nature are expected to become more numerous as tbe age of the field extends. PRODUCTION Total oil production duri^; 1943 was 6,571,609 net barrels, an average of 18,004 net barrels daily. The rate of production has been held practically constant throughout the year with only minor adjustments from time to time to achieve the dally average of 18,000 net barrels. This constant rate of withdrawal has afforded an excellent opportunity to observe reservoir behaviour under the conditions Imposed as a resultof the el much usel reservoii the limit r are aimic referred GAS INJEC throughou of inject by operat EDGE WATE cation of security normal, b rapid tha of oil pr demonstra be restor might be a daily a the daily the Addit; nel. Thi, essential under the A formal i December ] can be res2 of the elimination of certain wells by the security measures undertaken last year, and much useful information has been obtained. This information indicates a satisfactory reservoir performance at current rates of withdrawal, but illustrates a reduction in the limits of flexibility as a result of the security measures which were taken. We are aiming to restore this flexibility in the rehabilitation program previously referred to. GAS INJECTION: The injection of Fourth Pay gas into First and Second Pays has continued throughout the year. The rate of injection has remained constant but the distribution of injected volumes to First and Second Pays has been subject to changes as dictated by operating requirements. EDGE WATER ENCROACHMENT: Water production has been watched carefully during the year for any indi cation of harmful effects as a result of the redistribution of production imposed by security measures. The overall rate of increase of water production has remained normal, but in certain individual wells the rate of increase has been slightly more rapid than expected. No permanent, harmful effects are discernable at current rates °f oil production, but the behaviour of the individual wells referred to above again demonstrates the necessity for a better distribution of production before the field can be restored to that degree of flexibility necessary to meet any reasonable demands which might be called for. Water production for the year averaged 595 barrels per day as compared with a daily average of 569 barrels in 1942. The tabulation at the end of this report gives the daily average water production by months during the year. EXPLORATION OF ADDITIONAL AREA Local political considerations have not permitted any exploratory work in the Additional Area which could have been carried out with our small force of person nel. This fact, together with the inability to obtain necessary trained men and essential materials, due to circumstances of war, made us unable to fulfil obligations under the conditions of the Lease, and necessitated the application for a moratorium. A formal moratorium in respect of these obligations has been granted, dating from December 1, 1942, and extending until such time as reasonable normal Company operations can be resumed.Well Nun 19 (Sitra Whai No n Minor new facj equipment were Crac exchanger to i absorption tov the No.2 Unit, pressure drop in operation.

REFINERY AREA No major new operating facilities were completed during the year under review. Minor new facilities, and notable replacements, alterations, and additions to existing equipment were made as follows: Cracking Plants One of the No.l unit absorber feed coolers was converted to a feed-bottoms exchanger to reduce fouling of absorption oil coolers and resulting losses in the absorption tower. This converted exchanger, and the one similarly converted in 194-2 on the No.2 Unit, were connected in parallel with the two original exchangers to reduce pressure drop on the bottoms side, thus eliminating some of the difficulties experienced in operation. Gardner Denver 14 rt x 7-l/4 n x 14 n steam pumps were installed at each cracking unit. These pumps transfer water and coke fines from the coke chambers to the canal line when coke drilling operations are in progress. This avoids the constant sewer cleaning required when the water and coke fines run to the sewers. New hot oil pump piping was received and installed to replace the original piping which had been reduced to minimum thickness consistent with safe operation. Polymer Plant The compressed gas condensing capacity was augmented by the installation of a new condenser which was received for that purpose. This increased condenser capacity will reduce the gas losses which formerly occured when the original condensers became fouled. A shade was installed over the butane cylinder filling platform. The plant was altered during November to obtain two stage selective butene polymerization. The deethanizer was provided with 150 lb. steam in the reboiler for column operation as a depropanizer. The first stage feeds through one small and one large catalyst chamber to the former depropanizer column to which a new condenser has been added. The second stage feeds from the depropanizer reflux drum through one large catalyst chamber to the debutanizer column. An acid knock-out-drum for the second stage, and the second stage vaporizer were fabricated locally from available material. The butene polymers produced as a result of these alterations are suitable for hydrogenation stock in the manufacture of 100 octane gasoline.8 C.V.T. Plant Alterations and repairs at this plant included platform extensions for better access to the clay valves, relocation of the lime mixers, and replacement of a corroded slop receiver. Distillation Units A steam pump was installed in the burner fuel system as standby protec tion against failure of the existing rotary pumps which are no longer reliable and for which replacements are difficult to obtain. Power Plant The water outlets from the G.E. generator air-coolers were connected to the recirculating water pump suction-header in order to achieve reduced operating pressure and avoid possible leakage into the generators in the event of tube failure. One of the two drinking water tanks was lined with brick to reduce corrosion. SO 2 Plant Corrosion necessitated the complete rebuilding of the sulphur burner during the year. The SO 2 condenser bundle which was locally fabricated last year for atandby purposes has been installed as an extra condenser, thus giving additional protection when on maximum feed rates. New cold distillate, crude distillate, liquid SO 2 , and extract pumps have been received, and will be installed as soon as possible. These pumps are larger than the original German manufactured pumps which they will replace, and will provide greater flexibility in operation. Tankage A steam heater was Installed in tank 452 to break emulsions in CVT Plant bottoms. The installation of new bottoms in 23 tanks was necessitated by corrosion. Reformer The capacity of this plant has been increased by the following alterations:- (1) ^ The Feed - L.P. quench heat exchangers were connected in parallel; (2) The recycle cooler was altered to give greater cooling capacity and was connected in series with the feed exchanger to further cool the quench streams; (3) Thirty six additional tubes were installed in the furnace con vection bank; The polymer-tower bottom pumps were connected for parallel or series operation.

The plant will be used to refrigerate the Refinery ^ drinking water system, and to provide cold water for the new laboratory air cooling equipment. It has not yet been placed into service. Buildings A new construction office and storehouse building, and a new messhall building were built east of the Acid Manufacturing Plant. Alterations and additions were started for the enlargement of the labora tory. Completion must await the receipt of necessary materials. New Plants Construction was started on new plants for aviation gasoline production, and work was well under way by the end of the year; no operating units were completed. ZELLAQ, AREA No new facilities or buildings were added at Zellaq during the year. One dolphin was constructed at the south west corner of the inner wharf. SITRA AREA A new section was added to the existing materials pier to increase the available area for unloading barges. The wooden bridge piles on the Bahrein - Sitra bridge were badly eroded, and some of them had been removed since the last construction program. The missing piles were replaced, and the others were strengthened and protected by pouring a con crete casing around each pile. New Ethylizing facilities are being installed at the Sitra tank farm to re place the existing Ethylizing facilities at the wharf which are no longer adequate. A storage platform is provided for over 300 drums, and a weigh tank installation is included for Ethylizing into a new motor gasoline shipping tank. The shipping tank will not be finished until after the end of the year and the new eductor pump has not yet arrived. A new bottom was installed in 901 tank due to corrosion. A geological test hole drilled at the Wharf was completed as a water well and facilities were installed to provide an emergency water supply for ships calling at Sitra Anchorage.] 10 1M AWALI AREA During the yeer the Main Office was extended by the additi on of another wing. Additions and alterations were made to the Commissary to provide room for additional refrigerating equipment and cold storage space. The existing Compressor room and condenser platform were enlarged and alterations were were made to the interior oold rooms. The Garage was extended and rearranged to provide for shop space. New steam cleaning and washer facilities were added new working pits and as well as an office and tool and battery rooms. Additions wers made to the Housing Offioe and a tailoring room, linen storage room, a superintendent* s office and a clerk's office were added. Four new, 9 bedroom, two story, air conditioned, bachelor houses were built and the building of thirteen new air conditioned houses was started; six of these are three bedroom houses and seven are two-three bedroom convertible houses. Two additional 10 bedroom permanent living quarters and one kitchen for GSO employees were constructed. The Theatre,, storeroom addition and theatre dressing room were destroyed completely by fire on December 24 th, the origin of which has not been ascertained.

Yours sincerely, // f 'Awali « Bahrein Island ANNUAL REPORT1948 ANNUAL RaPOHT INTRO IX7CT ION: The activities of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited on Bahrein Island and In Its vicinity during the year 1942 are briefly reviewed in this report* Tabulations are presented showing (1) the statue of all oil, gas and water wells as of December 31, 1942, (2) the purpose, size and type of all buildings standing as of December 31, 1942, (3) the nationality and number of eaployees in the various phases of activity in the service of the Company at Bahrein as of December 31, 1942, and (4) the monthly oil production and dally average water production by months during the year under review. The locations of wells, camps, pump stations, pips lines, roads and other miscellaneous facilities are shown on ths attached wap. rim) Di^xoPMiOT k m± repair psreLOPKgyr: During tha early part of the year, the Company In cooperation with the Political and Military Authorities undertook a program of sacurlty work designed to assure the rapid and comp let a denial of oil to the enemy in the event of a deterioration in the Military situation resulting in the oeeupatlon of the Island by enemy forces. In carrying this Security Program into effect, the production from a large proportion of the number of available welle has been temporarily ali- mlnated, resulting in a reduction In the limits of the flexibility of the field which had been attained ae a result of the development polley of reeent years* Although flexibility has been somewhat curtailed, normal production require ments are obtained under conditions which arc ooncietent with good operating practice* The dictates of tha foregoing Military requirement a, together with the previous satisfactory state of development of the main producing horizons and the shortage of necessary personnel, have precluded any work of a develop ment nature which, under other circumstances, my have bean considered worth while. RiSPAlRt The work of correcting the unsatisfactory condition of one well which was carried forward from the previous year, was continued up to ths inception of the Security Program* Circumstances at that time did not permit final conclusions regarding the results of this work and the well has placed in a condition which will allow tha postponement of this work without detri mental results* In addition to ths above, one major repair program was carried to a successful conclusion to correct an unsetisfactory mechanical condition exist ing in the high pressure gas supply wall which is the source of gas for injection ourposes.Total oil production for the year vac 6,£40,62? not barrels, an arerago of 17,098 net barrel# daily. With the exception of a period of approximately three month# extend ing from the end of April to the beginning of Auguet, average daily production ha# been held at 18,000 bble/day. During that three month period, production was reduced to IS,000 bble/Aay to conform to a reduced refinery throughput resulting from an unfaroarable shipping schedule. The redistribution of production occasioned by the Elimination of certain wells In the Security Program has materially changed the conditions of withdrawal from the reservoir and the data ooHooted under the new conditions are being watched with interest. To data the## data are in line with our expectations and uphold the previously postulated theories of the mechanics of the reservoir. QAS INJECTION The gas Injection project, which In recent years hae been regarded as of an experimental nature, has fulfilled expectation# end the beneficial effect of retarding edge water encroachment is an established fast. Thla method of reservoir control Is now looked upon as s prerequisite to good operating practice.

No new wells were drilled or completed during this period. Forty-one of the seventy-four wells were plugged in accordance with instructions issued by military author! t» 103 « Exploration work in the additional area was continued during most of the year. IMPORTATION OF ARABIAN CRUDE Facilities for receiving up to 35,000 barrels per day of Arabian Crude were installed at Zellaq Terminal. This included a deep water wharf, submarine line, steam plant, pumping equipment and an additional 13,000 barrel tank. An additional crude oil line from Zellaq Terminal to the Refinery was also installed. Except for a few days of trial runs this equipment for additional capacity has neither been utilized nor required. The quantity of Arabian Crude imported during 1942 was approximately 4,429,000 barrels. REFINERY Preparations were made, including new pipe lines within the Refinery Area, to increase the crude oil process ing rate from the normal 33,500 barrels per calendar day, to 60,000 barrels per calendar day. The Refinery was not called upon to process this additional crude oil therefore planned alterations to certain individual processing units were not carried out. No new processing equipment was installed in the Refinery during 1942. Certain large expenditures were made however under the direction of military authorities. The total crude oil processed in the Refinery during year 1942 was approximately 10,763,000 barrels. During the months of May, June and July crude runs averaged 662,000 barrels per month or approximately 66 % of normal crude capacity, However large sections of the refinery were shut down entirely because of low crude running. The remaining nine months of the year crude runs averaged 974,000 barrels per month or approximately 97.5% or normal crude running capacity. SHIPPING One new shipping line was installed between the Refinery and Sitrah Terminal and two new lines were installed between the terminal and the loading wharf. Otherwise no alterations were made in the off-shore shipping system.- 2 - % A total of 111 tankers called for cargo during the year. They lifted a total of approximately: 3,443,000 barrels of motor gasoline * 1,805,000 w ' Kerosene 1,346,000 M n Diesel fuel 2,038,000 ' n Residual Fuel Oil. A total of 62 cargo ships called on our facilities for bunkers during the year. The Power Barge Caltex II was held in bunkering service in Sitrah anchorage to facilitate the despatch of cargo ships calling at this port for bunkers. A total of approximately 13,000 barrels of products were sold through our local service station facilities during the year. PERSONNEL The regular operations of producing, refining, shipping and service organizations required the employment of the following average number of men: Americans 29 British 119 Canadians and others 29 British Indians and others 237 Bahrain subjects and others 1624 Other special work done under military direction required an average of 910 natives during the last six months of the year. A temporary War Bonus payment in-addition to regular pay was instituted in April and is being paid monthly to all Non-staff employees to assist them in meeting the increased living cost due to world conditions. The schooling of Bahrain personnel was carried on as in the past. Excellent progress is being made by the natives that have shown an interest in learning a trade or a specific refinery operation. Two 12-room concrete block type houses, a bath-house and kitchen were built for native housing at the Zellaq Terminal. Mosquito and general health control service was maintained in and adjacent to areas of company operation.1 Confidential No. C/92S / n m ' *\i Political Agency, Bahrain, the 10th July 1943. F1U.

Annual Report of The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited for the year 1941.1941 ANNUAL REPORT Introduction: This report summarizes the activity of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited on Bahrein Island during the year 1941. It also presents in tabulated form (1) the status of all oil and water wells, (2) the purpose, size and type of all buildings (3) the na tionality and number of employees in the various phases of activity and (4) the monthly oil production and daily average water production by months during the year under review. The attached map shows the location of wells, camps, pump stations, pipe lines, roads and other miscellaneous facilities. FIELD DEVELOPMENT &amp; WELL REPAIR Development: No work of a development nature has been undertaken during the year. The main First and Second Pay producing zones are provided with sufficient points of withdrawal to afford satisfactory drainage of the main reservoir within the recognized producing area. Structurally low First Pay Wells drilled and completed during the years 1939 and 1940 have provided valuable data regarding the areal extent of the First Pay producing zones and their ability to produce. The application of data obtained from a laboratory investi gation conducted with the view of improving technique in the acidation of these formations may eventually permit increasing production sufficiently to warrant further development of this pay. Repair: The correction of any unsatisfactory mechanical condition which may be detri mental to the field and which is consistent with good operating practice has continued to be the policy governing well repair work. Two major repair programs dictated by this policy were conducted during the year. In one of these the unsatisfactory condition was rectified and the well is now standing pending a favorable opportunity to complete. The other is nearing completion and, when this has been accomplished, will remove the last outstanding unsatisfactory mechanical condition in the field. In addition to these major repair jobs the source of water was located in one well and successfully plugged off. A number of the larger wells have also been worked on to provide additional pro tection in the event of damage to surface connections. PRODUCTION The total oil production during 1941 amounted to 6,794,157 net barrels, a dailyaverage sary cux barrels December days bef rels per and pres Gas Inje Pay thrc of gas c in May t in injec of oolle reservoi oentage order tc of reset as the r Edge Wat daily a\ latter p pair of period averaged per day been mai lected d assisted-2 average of 18,614 net barrels. Consistent with a reduction in the shipment of refined products and the neces sary curtailment «of Refinery throughput, field production rate was reduced from 20,000 net barrels per day to 15,000 net barrels per day on September 15, 1941. Towards the end of December a more favorable shipping schedule was possible and on December 28, 1941, three days before the end of the year, the field production rate was increased to 18,000 net bar rels per day. Routine collection of data indicate continued satisfactory pressure distribution and pressure maintenance within the reservoir. Gas Injection: The injection of Fourth Pay Zone E gas produced through Well No. 51 into First Pay through Well No. 62 and into Second Pay through Well No. 63 has continued. Evidence of gas channeling within the First Pay was observed during the early part of the year and in May the injection rate to that pay was reduced to half its former value. This reduction in injected volume was effective in combating channeling and also afforded the opportunity of collecting important data under changed conditions of net fluid withdrawal from the reservoir. When the field oil production rate was reduced in September, a corresponding per centage reduction was made in the gas injection rate into both First and Second Pays in order to balance the net fluid withdrawal to a volume consistent with our accepted policy of reservoir pressure and edge water advance control. Our knowledge of the mechanics of the reservoir has been considerably enhanced as the result of the opportunity to obtain information under varying conditions. Edge Water Encroachment: The daily average water production for the year was 720 barrels compared with a daily average of 723 barrels during 1940. The reduced rate of oil production during the latter part of the year is chiefly responsible for this apparent decline although the re pair of one large water producing well also contributed to this achievement. During the period when the field produced oil at the rate of 20,000 barrels per day water production averaged 748 barrels daily and during the period at the reduced oil rate of 15,000 barrels per day water production averaged 617 barrels daily. The rate of increase in the percentage of water produced by individual wells has been maintained at a satisfactory low value by gas injection. The study of this important problem continues to occupy our attention. Data col lected during the year have clarified our conception of the mechanics involved and generally assisted in formulating production policies.tabulation Power Plan SO 2 Plant: Crude Dist Cracking P Polymer PL Tankage: General: ported on Concrete T: menoed in !-7- RETINERT AREA No new operating facilities were installed during the year.

Oil production was maintained at a satisfactory rate, which was practically constant throughout the year. No new processing plants were installed in the Refinery during 1940. Slight alterations were made to several plants to keep their capacity in line with the main refinery. Operating and maintenance practices have been standardized. The following report gives tabulations showing the number of employees, status of wells, and the number and type of buildings. The map attached shows the location of Wells, Pipelines, Refinery, Pump Stations, Roads and miscellaneous minor installations. FIELD DEVELOPMENT New drilling operations for the year were concentrated on further development of the First Pay (Orbitoides) outside the previously recognized producing area. Three new wells were drilled, and one abandoned hole re-entered in an attempt to expand the known areal extent of First Pay production. As a result, one important well was com pleted nearly two miles south of previous producers. While little oil has been obtained from the other three, further experimentation in acidizing technique may result in marked production increase from them. Four structurally low First Pay wells drilled in 1939 and wh.ich were on pro duction tests at the end of that year, were completed during 1940 as small producers. No further development of the Second Pay was undertaken during the past year, other than the completion of Well No. 69 after a prolonged series of tests performed to determine the effects of mud and cement on the producing horizons of the Second Pay. As a result of these tests, valuable information was obtained regarding the detrimental ef fects of these materials and the methods required to counteract such effects. Surface connections and equipment on all important wells in the field have been altered to provide better protection. WELL REPAIR In line with the policy of providing adequate protection to our oil reserves, major repair programs were completed in two wells in order to correct unsatisfactorymechanic?

Gas Inje the Seco ob ta i ne d into the and aver in order to be re of the o Edge Wat age of c during C studies as is tc by prodi. producii ing the control- 2 - mechanical conditions. The source of water in another hole was located and plugged, resulting in the completion of a well that had been an unsatisfactory producer. Water sources in two other wells were investigated and repair operations are being started in one of these wells. PRODUCTION During 1940, the field produced a total of 7,073,919 barrels of oil, a daily average of 19,328 barrels. Throughout the year oil production was held close to 20,000 barrels per day, except for a two weeks emergency period during October and November, when the majority of the wells were shut in. Studies show that pressure distribution within the reservoir has continued to improve and that pressure decline is under satisfactory control. This situation has been aided in the First and Second Pays by gas injection, the uniform field withdrawals of the past year, and our established method of distributing those withdrawals among wells. Gas Injection: Gas injection into the First Pay (Orbitoides) through Well No. 62 and into the Second Pay through Well No. 63, was continued during the year, the gas supply being obtained, as previously, from Fourth Pay Zone E through Well No. 51. Injection rates into the two pays fluctuated between approximately 3,500 M.C.F. and 5,000 M.C.F. daily and averaged approximately 4,300 M.C.F. The relatively minor changes in rate were made in order to balance similar fluctuations in oil withdrawals. Injection volume continues to be regulated on the policy of replacing approximately one-half the reservoir volume of the oil withdrawn. Results to date indicate this rate to be satisfactory. Edge Water Encroachment: Water production for the year averaged 723 barrels per day with a daily aver age of only 581 barrels per day during December, as compared with 840 barrels per day during January. Although these figures represent a declining rate, individual well studies show that the volume of edge water production is increasing slowly but steadily, as is to be expected. The decrease in water output of the field has been brought about by production manipulation, gas injection, and repair in certain of the larger water producing wells. Various special studies of the past year have increased our knowledge regard ing the position of encroaching edge water and have contributed materially to a scientific control of water encroachment. As reported last year, with very few exceptions, the greatA -3- ~?7&amp;i majority of wet wells produce only small amounts of water that have little bearing on reser voir conditions but necessitate special treating care in order that clean oil may be shipped to the Refinery. EXPLORATION OF ADDITIONAL AREA In accordance with agreements entered into between the Sheikh of Bahrein and The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, the Company during the past year conducted extensive ex ploration operations within the dominions of the Sheikh, particularly outside the previously leased area. Marine geophysical investigations were conducted over a considerable portion of the area of the Gulf in the vicinity of Bahrein Island. In addition, eight holes were drilled for structural information on the rim of Bahrein Island, on adjoining islands, and on specially constructed piers placed in the Gulf. The program of exploration by structure drill ing is being continued. Work has not advanced to the point where final conclusions are justi fied.

Reference to previous correspondence: Description of Enclosure.1939 ANNUAL REPORT This Report is intended to summarize briefly the activity of The Bahrein Petroleum Compemy Ltd,, on Bahrein Island during the year 1939. During the year 1939 some new processing plants were installed and additions and capacity increases were made to several plants. Standardization of Operating and Maintenance practices was fairly well established. The Report contains tabulations showing the number of employees, the status of wells, and the number and type of all buildings. The Map attached shows the location of Wells, Pipelines, Refinery, Pump Stations, Roads, and Miscellaneous Minor Installations. BUILDINGS Provision of additional housing for employees has been continued and three duplex married houses were built during the year. Four construction bunkhouses were reconditioned and air cooled to make semi permanent bachelor quarters. Additional cooling equipment, to provide necessary capacity for cooling this additional housing, was installed at No. 2 A.C. Plant. Construction of permanent type housing for native employees has been started and two units of 10 rooms each had been completed at the end of the year. DRILLING Four small wells developed production from the Orbitoides zones outside the previous areal limits of production although tests on three of these were not completed. Well No. 4-, drilled in 1934 about 1$ miles south of the present producing area, has been re-entered and completed as an oil producer, following acidization of the Orbit oides Zone. No additional development of the Second Pay limestone occurred during the past year. The trends of edge water movement and reservoir pressure conditions in dicate that closer well spacing in this zone is unnecessary, at least for the present. One major repair operation was completed, and another undertaken, for the purpose of keeping the Second Pay producing wells in a high state of efficiency.of three v resulted J producing detailed s 69 with a siltstone produotivi producing age of 20 , the daily rels per &lt; per day, 1 vember. j barrels p&lt; gard to pi degree th&lt; and distr: care must and under' Although the produ of water GAS INJEC 1 gas injeo limestone supply ofThe development of the siltstone zone was continued by the completion of three wells to produce from these formations only. Fourth pay development resulted in the completion of three wells during the year, making a total of five producing wells. Drilling and completion methods received a large amount of attention. A detailed series of tests were conducted in connection with the drilling of Well No. 69 with a view to determining the effects of mud and cement on the limestone and siltstone formations penetrated, and to determine to what extent any decrease in productivity suffered because of these factors, may be remedied by acidization. Some changes were made in surface connections and equipment on the producing wells in order that better protection might be obtained. PRODUCTION The oil production for the year totalled 7,588,554 barrels, a daily aver age of 20,791 barrels. Production for the first seven months remained fairly constant, the daily average by months during that period ranging between 20,000 and 22,000 bar rels per day. The daily average rose in August to the year's high of 23,800 barrels per day, then dropped gradually to the year's low of 18,787 barrels per day for No vember. At the end of the year, the rate was holding at a little more than 22,000 barrels per day. Observation of depth pressures indicate that reservoir conditions with re gard to pressure distribution and decline have continued to improve. To a great degree these benefits may be attributed to a moderate and uniform withdrawal rate and distribution of withdrawal from the reservoir on a technical basis. This year’s completions in the Fourth Pay have demonstrated that unusual care must be exercised in withdrawing oil from the narrow oil layer, capped by gas and underlain by water, that exists in the principal oil zone (zone F) of that pay. Although the high formation pressures will permit the rapid withdrawal of fluids, the production of oil must be held at a low rate in order to prevent the drawing in of water from below or excessive gas from above. GAS INJECTION: The improvement of reservoir conditions also can be attributed in part to gas injection. Throughout the year, injection has continued into the Second Pay limestone through Well No. 63 and into the Orbitoides Pay through Well No. 62, the supply of gas being obtained as previously from Fourth Pay zone 2 through Well No. 51.&lt; JDS* From January 1939 until the year part of June, injection volumes were fairly con stant between 4 and million cu. ft. daily. From early June to early August, the rate was reduced to between 2 and 2^ million cu. ft. daily. Since early August, the rate has been increased and has varied between 4$ and million cu. ft. daily. The volume of gas injected has approximated half the volume of the oil withdrawn. The expectation is that at this rate, the gas will not channel, and will retard the movement of edge water to such an extent that the water will have an opportunity to flush the oil effectively from the producing formations. EDGE WATER £NCROACH?.ENT: Edge water has continued to move into some parts of the Second Pay lime stone from which oil is being withdrawn. Edge water encroachment is characteristic of this type of reservoir and generally is considered beneficial as regards ultimate recovery and the maintenance of reservoir pressure, provided the proper control is exercised. Comprehensive data on water encroachment in siltstone is not yet avail able, but some small advance is occurring. Although a considerable number of wells show water, the total water pro duction is small, averaging about 800 b/d with an oil production of 20,000 b/d, or an average cut of about 4$. At the end of last year, only 8 wells were showing water cuts of 20$ or more. At the end of this year, that number has not increased, and only two, both of which were showing important water production a year ago, have shown notable increases. The great majority of wet wells produce only small amounts of water that have no important bearing upon production, other than to necessitate special care in eliminating the water from the oil shipped to the Refinery.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED 'FOR TilE YEAR 1938.■V The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited 1938 ANNUAL REPORT1938 i^NNUAL REPORT This Report is designed to summarize briefly the activity of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Ltd., on Bahrein Island during the year 1938. In general, the activity has been to complete major construction Jobs started in 1937, to develop and improve all operating practices and equipment, and to prepare a program for steady future development. The Report contains tabulations showing the number of employees, the status of Y/ells, and the number and type of all buildings. The map attached shews the location of Wells, Pipelines, Refinery, Pump Stations, Roads and Hiscellaneous Minor Installations. BUILDINGS Building for the purpose of housing employees has continued during the past year. The 15 air-conditioned duplex married quarters started in 1937 were completed, and 5 additional duplex houses were built, bringing the total number of air-conditioned dwellings, for both married and single employees, to 112. The second centrally located air-conditioning plant was installed and the older native type living quarters were provided with air-cooling equipment. An addition to the Main Office building was provided. DRILLING Development of the First and Second Pays as a unit continued steadily through the year of 1938, resulting in the drilling and completion of eleven Wells within these formations. Of these, seven were completed to produce from the Silt- stone only. In addition, three old Yfells were deepened to include additional Second Pay formations. In the Fourth Pay, two wells have been completed, one of which was deepened from the Third Pay. At the present time, three additional Fourth Pay Wells are being drilled. Drilling technique has been altered during the year by the elimination of the use of oil in drilling through the oil producing horizons. This interval is nowpenetrated i and gun per] the Limestoi adopted as i SI the electric selection of Tl average of € during Januo March has be B/D.

The acidation of the Limestone Pays following gun perforating, has proved successful and has been adopted as regular practice. Studies of structure have been improved markedly by the introduction of the electric logging method, resulting in greater accuracy in the correlation and selection of producing intervals. PRODUCTION The Oil production for the year totalled 8,297,998 barrels, a monthly average of 691,500 barrels, and a daily average of 22,734 barrels. The daily average during January and February, was held above 25,000 B/D, but since the beginning of March has been maintained with reasonable uniformity at olightly more than 22,000 B/D. Depth pressure observations indicate that this production rate, coupled with uniformity of withdrawal and technical control of production distribution, has resulted in definite improvement of reservoir conditions as compared with those existing in 1937. Edge Water Encroachment: During the year, edge water continued to make its appearance, chiefly in the Second Pay, through Walls located relatively low on the structure. While a considerable number of Wells have produced water, the percentage cut in general has been low, only eight Wells at present showing cuts of 20% or more. Edge water is advancing through a limited interval within Second Pay lime, but its progress appears to be quite uniform and normal. Conditions to date have not permitted such reliable determination of the nature of edge water advance in the Siltstone section of the Second Pay, but there is reason to believe that it also will be normal. Gas Injection: On April 14th, gas injection was started into the First and Second Pays for the purpose of conserving the reservoir energies, with a view to maximum oil recovery. Gas obtained from the Fourth Pay through Well No. 51, was injected into the First and Second Pays through Well No. 7, located near the structural high of these latter formations. Injection rates for the first month averaged about 8,000 M.C.F. daily, were then reduced to about 4,000 M.C.F. daily, and continued at this rate until June 15th, when the project was stopped to permit alteration of the me chanical condition of Well No. 51. During this period, a total of 378,663 M.C.F.was injected. Operations were resumed on November 27th and have been continued to date. While No. 51 remains the source of cas, injection has been shifted to the Second Pay lime through Well No. 63 and to the First Pay through Well No. 62. Each Well now receives approximately 2,000 M.C.F. daily, or a total daily injection of approximately 4,000 M.C.F. The source of gas through Well No. 51 is Zone 'E' of the Fourth Pay only. Tests on this zone indicate that it contains no oil but only high pressure gas. It is anticipated that the gas injection will not halt the movement of edge water, but will slew its advance, permitting it to exercise the maximum flush ing effect upon the producing formations. With this thought in mind, we are attempting to inject a formation volume of gas considerably less than the total formation volume of the oil and gas being removed. REFINERY The Refinery bperating facilities were improved by the addition of the following major units: (a) Power Kerosene Rerun Unit; (b) Slop Dehydrator; (c) Inhibitor Plant; (d) Lime Dehydrator and Classifier. Plans are made and the installation of a Polymerization Plant will be started early in 1939, with first operation scheduled for August, 1939. PIPE LINES In addition to the usual field flow lines which were laid to connect new completed producing Wells to the Field Gathering System, the followir^ pipe lines were laid: la) 8” - lO' Power Kerosene Submarine Ling at Sitra. lb) 6'’ Crude Submarine Line at Zellaq.

This report is designed to summarize that activity. It contains tabulations showing the number of employees, the status of Wells, and the kind and type of all buildings. The map attached shows the location of Wells, Pipelines, Camps, Refinery, Pump Stations, Roads and miscellaneous minor installations of The Bahrein Petroleum Company on Bahrein Island. BUILDINGS Building for the purpose of housing employees has continued during the past year. A group of 36 air-conditioned cottages, an air-conditioned Theatre and an air- conditioned Hospital were completed. Several extensions were made to the Main Office building. A number of buildings in the Old Camp were dismantled and re-erected in the New Camp for storage of miscellaneous material. Later in the year a group of 8 - 4 bed room air-conditioned cottages for single quarters were begun as well as 15 air-conditioned duplex married quarters. Also completed were 12 Class II houses of 12 rooms each. DRILLING At the end of 1936, sufficient potential production had been developed in the Second Pay (Main Pay) to supply the anticipated crude demand, and the drilling program was changed from straight development to partial exploration during 1937. Two wells were drilled to test the economic possibilities of the Third Pay at a depth of about 2900 feet, or some 900 feet below the top of the Second Pay. No commercial production was found in the Third Pay. As a result of this exploratory w ork the normal drilling program was slowed down and only eight new wells were completed in the Second Pay during the year. Two wells, previously completed in the upper part of the Second Pay, were deepened to produce from the entire Second Pay section. The centrally located deep test well continued to prospect ahead. A 550-foot section (now termed the Fourth Pay) of porous limestone interbedded with anhydrite was topped at about 4150 feet. Numerous drill stem tests indicated that the limestone was very permeable and that it carried large volumes of natural gas under high nressure together with a small amount of high gravity oil or condensate. Drill stem tests also indicated that the bottom 50 feet of this 550-foot section carried an encouraging amount of heavier oil, gravity about 37° A.P.I., with characteristics similar to the oil produced from the Second Pay. A well is being started somewhat down-structure from the deep test to better determine the oil producing possibilities of the Fourth Pay.t So wells sterte 1500 feet of with rotary shale sectio circulation, control. A Third Pay te the Second P Th barrels. E fluctuating find the pro This practic barrels with of widely va steady deman Ed on the south Du completed. Tb of Crude Oil Th A will be comiSome refinements in drilling technique were adopted during the year. All wells started to the Second Pay were drilled with rotary from the surface. The top 1500 feet of porous limestone section, formerly drilled with cable tools, is now drilled with rotary without circulation using water to wash the cuttings into cavities. The shale section from this point to the top of the oil horizons is drilled with natural mud circulation. The productive horizons are drilled with oil circulation under pressure control. A second satisfactory method of completing wells was developed when the two Third Pay test wells were plugged back and gun perforated through cemented casing opposite the Second Pay with good results. PRODUCTION The production for the year was 7,762,264 barrels, a monthly average of 646,855 barrels. During the first ten months of the year production was varied to meet the fluctuating refinery and off-shore shipment demand. As a result of these fluctuations we find the production varying from 254,937 barrels in August, to 847,988 barrels in October. This practice was stopped in November when the daily average allotment was placed at 25,000 barrels with a maximum allowable of 30,000 barrels for any one day. Under the conditions of widely varying demand it was not possible to equitably allocate the production, but with steady demand we have been able to produce the wells in accordance with a balanced schedule. Edge water appeared during the first part of the year in some of the edge wells on the south flank of the structure and was found later on the east and west flanks as well. REFINERY During December 1937, all major construction started in 1936 and 1937 was completed. The Refinery, in December 1937 was capable of running approximately 25,000 barrels of Crude Oil per day. The major units in the Refinery on January 1, 1938 consist of: - 2 Cracking Stills 1 Power Plant 2 Distillation Units 1 Reformer 1 SO 2 Treating Plant 1 Clay Vapor Treating Plant 1 Acid Manufacturing Plant 1 Acid Treating Plant - with an additional small Plant under construction 2 Treating Plants for Refined Products Laboratories Loading ’Vharf A small Re-run Still and working tankage is being constructed. A Slop-dehydrator will be completed early in 1938.equipment PIPE LINES During 1937 two sea lines were laid. The loading facilities now consist of 3-12', 1-10', and 1-8' pipe lines. During the year 1938, one additional 8' pipe line will be provided. All these lines are from Sitra Terminal to the Loading Wharf. In 1937 two oil lines were built from the Refinery to Sitra, both 10'. A 3' water line from the Refinery to the Main Camp was laid for transferring treated water. TANKAGE Two Royalty measuring tanks - 152 and 153 - were put into service during the year. All crude from the pipe lines is pumped into these tanks for Royalty measuring purposes. During the year ending 1937, the Refinery storage consisted of 95 tanks for the following products: - Crude Oil 541,200 bbls. Fuel Oil 570,180 bbls. Finished Kerosene 105,200 bbls. Finished Gasoline 531,693 bbls. Processed Gasoline 284,200 bbls. Processed Kerosene 149,900 bbls. Diesel Oil 124,920 bbls. Miscellaneous 99,857 bbls. (Includes Water, Skimming,Slop,Extract C.V.T.

Most of the buildings shown as being in the old camp will be abandoned and dismantled after the construction work at the new camp has been completed. In addition to the wells that were completed during the year and the construction of the camps there was also corn dieted during the year an oil gathering system in the field with a pump station to pump the oil to the Island of Sitra, at which point terminal facili ties were completed consisting of three large storage tanks, pump house, etc,, as well as a submarine line extending into the Persian Uulf. The Company have not given any details in this report concerning the facili ties at sitra or the submarine line as plans and a description of these facilities have already been furnished. There was also constructed during the year a topping plant which is located near tank battery No. 1 as indicated on the general plan included herewith. The work of constructing the gathering system terminal facilities at Sitra and submarine line was done by a force of trained men who were sent to Bahrein on a tanker. After the completion of this work the crew sent for that purpose departed and the tanker left with a cargo of Bahrein crude which was the first one shipped from this field. At the end of the year 1934 plans were under way for the sale of additional cargoes of crude oil approximating 110,000 barrels each (two cargoes have since been transported and sold and it is anticipated that three more cargoes will be shipped within the next six months).

During the year, facilities which permit the direct loading and unloading of ocean-going ships at Sitra were completed and placed in operation. The Refinery was operated at essentially maximum crude oil running capacity during the year and, toward the end of the year, construction was commenced on facilities for the manu facture of asphalt products. Tabulations are presented showing: (1) The status of all oil, gas and water wells as of December 31, 194-6 (2) The monthly oil production and daily average water production during the year (3) The purpose, size and type of buildings standing as of December 31, 1946 (4) The nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity of the Company at Bahrein on December 31, 1946. The location of wells, camps, pump stations, pipelines^ roads, refinery and miscellaneous facilities are shown on the map included with this report. FIELD DEVELOPLIENT &amp; IVELL REPAIR DEVELOPMENT: Field development was resumed during the year and seven new wells have been completed or nearly completed. The drilling of these wells is part of a program undertaken to (l) replace wells captured by the expanding gas cap and advancing edge-2- water thus assuring the field’s ability to sustain current production rates, (2) re distribute withdrawed from the reservoir to assure maximum economic recovery, (3) in crease rate and improve distribution of injected gas, and (4) permit further observa tion of the effects of production practice on the reservoir. Two of the wells already completed in this program were drilled solely for gas injection purposes, one to Second Pay Limestone and one to Second Pay Siltstone, and are now in operation. Three wells have been finished as dual completions to produce selectively from Second Pay Limestone and Second Pay Siltstone and two wells are in the process of being similarly completed. A total of twelve wells are included in the current program, four of which will be completed to serve the dual purpose of producing selectively from First Pay and observing the advance of edge water in Second Pay Limestone on the flanks of the structure. REPAIR: A number of wells are standing awaiting major repairs before they can be returned to production but this work has been held in abeyance to permit a more rapid advance in the current development program. Minor repair work necessary for the &amp; maintenance of important wells and the protection of oil reserves has been carried out. ■m Tabulation No.l shows the status of all oil and gas wells as of December 31, 1946, and Tabulation No.l-A gives similar data for Company Water Wells:Well 18 (North 19 (Old £ 20 (Sitra 21 (New 3 22 (New S PRODUCTIO an averag by months and gas ii increase ' wells has reservoir end of the GA3 INJEC1 were drill additional producing Well No.5:Well Number Commenced Drilling Date of Completion Depth Feet 18 (North Sitra) Nov. 17, 1940 Dec. 30, 1940 347 19 (Old Sitra Wharf) Dec. 27, 1942 Feb. 14, 1943 370 PI.325 20 (Sitra Causeway) Aug. 11, 1945 Aug. 29, 1945 322 PI.313 21 (New Sitra Wharf) Feb. 27, 1946 Mar. 6, 1946 318 22 (New Sitra Wharf) Dec. 22, 1946 - 283 ♦'Water supply for villagers - Malamir ♦♦Commenced deepening February 10, 1941 ♦♦♦Recompleted February 24, 1941 n tOA) Present Status Dec. 31, 194-6. Capped Producer Producer Producer Drilling PRODUCTION: Oil production from the field during 194-6 totalled 8,009,802 net barrels, an average of 21,94-5 net barrels daily. Total net oil production and daily average by months is given in Tabulation No.II. The field production rate was increased during the year as additional wells and gas injection facilities provided in the development program were completed. The increase in gas injection rate afforded by the provision of additional gas injection wells has resulted in the ability to control the influx of extraneous water into the reservoir thus permitting this higher rate of withdrawal. The field was being produced at the rate of 25,000 net barrels daily at the end of the year. CAS INJECTION: As previously mentioned in this report, two additional gas injection wells were drilled during the year and facilities were provided to permit the injection of additional quantities of Fourth Pay Zone 'S'* gas into the main First and Second Pay Producing horizons. Gas for this purpose is being supplied, as in past years, thro ^h Well No.51. - 3 --9- Gas injection to First Pay through Well No.62 has remained at a constant rate while the injection rate to Second Pay through Well Nos.63, 75 and 78 (the latter two being the new wells) has been increased. Well Nos.63 and 75 are completed to inject into Second Pay Limestone Zone 'A' and Well No.78 is completed to inject into Second Pay Siltstone Zone 'C'. Injection rates were regulated to retard edge water advance on the basis of past observations and as more data are collected the rate will be further increased until the optimum rate is determined. The beneficial effect of the increased injection rate is discernible in the maintenance of reservoir pressure and edge water control. Four additional wells on the crest of the structure were captured by the expanding gas cap during the year, necessitating a reduction in the rate of produc tion from the individual wells concerned. • Periodic observations of the level of the gas-oil contact in Second Pay Limestone indicates that it is receding at a satisfactorily uniform rate. EDGE WATER ENCROAGHMENT: Total water production for the year averaged 1520 barrels per day as compared with a daily average of 1201 barrels in 1945. This increase in total water production is largely due to the increase in production rate but it is of interest to note that the rate of water production, expressed as a percentage of total withdrawal, has increased from only 6.2# at the beginning of the year to 6.4# at the end. This rate of increase of water production is less than that observ4|i in previous years and is one of the beneficial effects of the current gas injection practice.

In maintaining the five oil-gathering stations in a satisfactory operating condition the roofs of eight tanks were replaced. The roofs of an additional three tanks are scheduled for replacement. ARABIAN CRUDE OIL: The pipe line from Saudi Arabia has operated satisfactorily throughout the year and 25,017,463 net barrels of crude were delivered through it. An additional 862,223 net barrels of Arabian crude were delivered by tanker through the Sitra Marine Terminal, making a total of 25,879,686 net barrels of Arabian crude received in the Refinery during the year.Explorat: the year and the d] are under way for 1 drilling piers in 1 d^l Refining Crude runs totalled as follows: In additi petroleum coke, whi As the de war, very little av short run, the faci of the refining fac REFINERY: No major there were alterati (a) Polymer P (b) Fluid Cati for incr' ■-11- EXPLORATION 07 ADDITIONAL AREA Exploration work within the Additional Area was resumed towards the end of the year and the drilling of one structure hole has been completed.

REPINING OPERATIONS Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput. Crude runs totalled 34-»066,194’ barrels. Shipments of products during the year were as follows: Aviation Gasoline 417,842 Barrels Gasoline 7,941,682 ' Kerosene 4,089,264 ' Diesel Oil 6,478,022 ' Fuel Oil 12.309.814 n Total 31,236,624 ' In addition to the above shipments, the Company shipped 118,275 tons of petroleum coke, which had been produced in prior year’s refining operations. As the demand for aviation gasoline had dropped rapidly with the end of the war, very little aviation gasoline was produced during the year, and, except for one short run, the facilities for manufacturing this product remained down. .The balance of the refining facilities continued operating at capacity. REFINERY: No major new operating facilities were completed during 1946. However, there were alterations and additions made to several existing plants, as follows: (a) Polymer Plant reconverted to produce motor polymers (b) Fluid Catalytic Cracker converted to a Crude Unit and subsequently altered for increased crude running1 (c) Increased the capacity of No.3 Crude Unit (d) Addition of an antimony trichloride injection system at the Isomerization Unit (e) Relocated reformed and thermally cracked gasoline Lead Sulphide Sweetening Plants (f) Additions to tanks and lines necessitated by in creased crude running. ** 4 Refinery facilities under construction in 1945 and completed in 1946, as follows: (a) Refinery storehouse (b) 3, 1000-KVA transformers at the Awali-Sitra Substation (c) Additional 3000 KW generator at No. 2 Power Plant (d) Air Conditioning for Refinery Yard Office (e) 80-ton steam jet central refrigerating plant. New construction started during 1946 includes' (a) Asphalt Manufacturing Plant (b) New Central Tool Room (c) Additions to Gatehouse and Office (d) Additions to Transfer Pump House (e) Additional diesel and fuel blending facilities (f) Improvements to the Refinery burner fuel oil system. Preparation of the site for the new Asphalt Plant necessitated the demolition of the Refinery paint and carpenter shop. Facilities which were commenced in 1945 and not completely constructed until 1946 are as follows: (a) Causeway (b) New 'Wharf (c) Additional shipping facilities (d) Electric power line - Refinery to Sitra (e) Sitra Pierhead 11.5 KV transmission line and substation (f) Telephone facilities, Refinery to Sitra (g) Magneto telephone system in the Sitra tank field - 12 -(h) Tempore The fo] (a) Extendi DRUM PLANT 4 No majc provided to incre AW ALT Increas Awali.

During the year facilities for the production of aviation gasoline and increased cjuantities of other products vital to the successful prosecution of the war were completed and placed into operation. The construction of facilities to permit loading and unloading ocean going ships at Sitra was commenced during the year and was progressing satisfactorily as the year ended. Tabulations are presented showing: (1) The status of all oil, gas and water wells as of December 31, 1945; (2) The monthly oil production and daily average water production by months during the year; (3) The purpose, size and type of buildings standing as .of December 31, 1945; ( 4 ) The nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity of the Company at Bahrein on December 31, 1945. The location of wells, camps, pump stations, pipelines, roads, refinery and miscellaneous facilities are shown on the map included with this report. producing; field FIELD DEVELOPMENT &amp; WELL REPAIR Although no actual development work was commenced during the year, plans were laid, equipment and materials were ordered and some preliminary work was done pursuantto a dev nature w possible this prc to produ work-ove at the e reserved equipmer one maj&lt; was nec&lt; repairs were be; exi sts. through As stat by year Decembe as of t- 2 - to a development program to be inaugurated in 194-6. Considerable work of a geological nature was done in the re-examination of well formation samples to obtain all data possible and several water wells throughout the Island were electric-logged. Four more wells were rehabilitated during the year, leaving four wells in this program still secured and requiring extensive re-work before they can be returned to production. Four additional wells were standing and these require major repair and work-over jobs before they can be returned to production. One such Job was in progress at the end of the year. Observations of essential data necessary for scientific reservoir control were increased consistent with the availability of personnel and equipment. Several minor repairs were made to cellar and surface well connections and one major repair job started which will be carried on to conclusion. This repair job was necessitated by corrosion of a liner. A second well was mudded off waiting major repairs due to a leak in the casing probably resulting from corrosion. Observations were being made at a third well to determine whether or not a suspected casing leak exists. A fourth well requiring a major work-over job has remained mudded off throughout the year awaiting sufficient drilling personnel to undertake the work. As stated previously repair jobs due to corrosion can be expected to increase year by year as the field grows older. Tabulation No. 1 shows the status of all the oil and gas wells as of December 31, 1945 and Tabulation No. 1-A shows the status of the Company water wells as of the same date.8 expansion of the artificial gas cap. This has a tendency to cut down the flexibility of the field and exemplifies the need of more wells, as planned in the forthcoming Development Program, to maintain production and scientific control of the reservoir necessary for maximum ultimate recovery. Chemical treatment of several rehabilitated wells was resorted to in an attempt to restore impaired productivity which resulted from the method of securing in the Denial Scheme. These treatments have been only partly successful and it is doubtful whether further treatment will completely restore their former ability to produce. GAS INJECTION Gas injected into First and Second Pays has continued without interruption throughout the year. The total daily injection rate to the two Pays has remained constant; however, the distribution of injected gas was altered by increasing the proportion injected to Second Pay and decreasing the proportion injected to First Pay. This was done to retard the advance of the First Pay gas cap so that the First Pay producing section in wells open to both First and Second Pays would not be cap tured by gas ahead of the Second Pay producing sections in these same wells. Gas for injection was produced from Fourth Pay Zone 'E' as in the past. A project to bury the gas injection lines to eliminate freezing troubles, caused by the formation of hydrates, during the winter months was approved and trenching for this installation was in progress at the end of the year.

Tabulation No. 2 shows the total oil and water production from the field by months for the year 1945, together with the average daily production per month. The increase in water production from August to the end of the year was due to the return of a Siltstone edge well to production. Four wells were prepared for oil-water level observations in the Second Pay. These wells are strategically located, one on each side and one on each end of the struc ture. Water has not made its appearance at one of these locations but observations of the position of the oil-water contact in the other three wells are being made regularly. Two additional water disposal wells were drilled adjacent to wells 54-5F and 27-5F to dispose of the water produced by them and other neighboring wells TABULATION II MONTBT.?

Oil collection and delivery line corrosion experi enced in the past has been at a minimum. During the latter part of the year alteration and expansion of the oil gathering system on the west side of the Field was commenced to collect production from the wells to be drilled in the 1946 Development Program. The five oil-gathering stations have been maintained and operated satis factorily and no alterations were found necessary. ARABIAN CRUDE OIL The total Imports of Arabian crude during 1945 were 15,662,624 net barrels. Upon completion of the 12' pipeline from Saudi Arabia to the Refinery, the Zellaq Terminal was dismantled. The last cargo received through Zellaq was on March 3, 1945 and from January 1st to March 3rd, a total of 1,831,053 net barrels were received through these facilities before they were abandoned. The balance of the Arabian crude was received through the pipeline with the exception of 564,225 net barrels delivered to Sitra by tanker. REFINING OPERATIONS Refining operations throughout the year were at a high rate of throughput and were augmented by the commissioning of facilities for the manufacture of aviation gaso line. During the year 1945 crude runs totalled 22,875,136 barrels of which approxi mately 32% was Bahrein Crude and the balance imported from Saudi Arabia. Shipments of products during the year were divided as follows:-Barrels Aviation Gasoline 322,997 Gasoline 5»236,866 Kerosene 2,331»684 Diesel Oil 4,356,653 Fuel Oil 5.637.255 Total 17,885,455* n ♦During November a sale of 360,650 barrels aviation gasoline was made to the U. S. Navy. Of this quantity 130,414 barrels were shipped during 1945 and included in the tabulation above, the balance of 230,236 barrels remained in our storage tanks at Sitra at the end of 1945. The demand for aviation gasoline dropped rapidly with the ending of the war with the result that aviation shipping tankage was full about the end of October. All aviation gasoline manufacturing facilities were shut down at that time and remained idle to the end of the year. The balance of the refinery facilities continued operating at capacity. As mentioned in our report for the year 1944, a large construction program was undertaken to increase refinery facilities and to produce aviation gasoline for military purposes. Facilities completed during 1945 included: (a) Extension of the salt water system to all new plants commissioned. (b) No. 2 Power Plant (boiler section only). (c) Butane isomerization unit. (d) Alkylation unit. (e) New acid manufacturing and recovery facilities. (f) Fluid catalytic cracking unit. (g) Gas concentration unit for fluid catalytic cracking unit. (h) - Aviation acid treating plant. (i) Central caustic dissolving plant. (j) Two new lead sulfide sweetening plants. (k) Aviation gasoline ethylizing and inhibiting plants. (l) Conversion of the polymer plant to a thermal gas recovery unit. (m) Miscellaneous pumphouse extensions. (n) Additional tankage and lines. (o) New welding and machine shops. (p) Conversion of the messhall erected for the construction force to a combined refinery messhall and yard office.12 - (q) Alterations and additions to the shipping facilities at Sltra. With the completion of the foregoing facilities, the major items of refining equipment and their respective nominal capacities may be summarized as follows:- Number of Units 3 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 2 1 2 Description Crude Distillation Units Power Kerosene Rerun Unit Gasoline Reforming Units Thermal Cracking Units Kerosene S0 2 Treating Plant Nominal Capacity 65,000 BPCD 2,500 BPCD 13,000 BPCD 13,500 BPCD 8,100 BPCD Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit{Finished 100 )Octane Aviation Butane Isomerization Plant {Gasoline )production Alkylation Unit )capacity.

ADDITIONAL GENERATOR - NO. 2 POWER PLANT An additional 3000 KW generator was in the process of installation and will be available for use early in 1946. With the completion of this unit, the total rated nominal electric power capacity will be 14000 KW. ADDITIONAL SHIPPING FACILITIES With the large increase in shipments resulting from the increased crude running, additional shipping lines and higher capacity pumps were necessary for satis factory loading of vessels. The increased facilities consist of three new 12” loading lines from Sitra to the new loading wharf and two new 5»000 Bbl/hr. shipping pumps located at Sitra. On completion of this equipment it will be possible to load gasoline, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil at the rate of approximately 5,000 Bbls/hr. for each pro duct. It is anticipated that this installation will be completed early in 1946. CAUSEWAY The new 30* wide causeway which was indicated in the 1944 report as being built to a point about 13,000 feet offshore was placed into operation before full com pletion in order to utilize it in connection with the new wharf construction. Also, during the latter part of the year it was used to advantage in connection with bulk shipments of coke and three cargoes of products shipped in drums. The causeway construction was not complete at the end of the year and some dirt and rock fill was still required to bring the roadway up to specified elevation before completion of final grading work. It is anticipated that this work will befinished early NEW WHARF Durj about 1,800 f« it by an elevt wharf is arrai berths, while coming suppli&lt; It ; incoming cargi March, 1946. ing pumps at I in a 24 to 36 coming AWALI The personnel whi out and six n14 - finished early in 1946. NEW WHARF During 1945, construction of a new four berth wharf was started, located about 1,800 feet beyond the pierhead terminus of the new causeway and connected to it by an elevated trestle adequate to handle all necessary truck traffic. This new wharf is arranged in such a manner that bulk oil loadings can be handled at three berths, while the fourth berth will be used for bunkering purposes, receipt of in coming supplies, and the loading of outgoing shipments of products in drums. It is expected that the south end of this wharf will be ready for receiving incoming cargo about January 5, 1946 and that all construction will be completed during March, 1946. With the completion of these facilities and the installation of new load ing pumps at Sitra, it should be possible to complete the loading of any bulk oil cargo in a 24 to 36 hour period. CAMP FACILITIES AWALI The enlarged refining and attendant facilities have necessitated increased personnel which required extensions to the Awali village. A new housing area was laid out and six new two-bedroom and eleven new three-bedroom air cooled houses were erected, while twenty two-bedroom houses were in the course of construction at the end of the year. A new sewage pumphouse was also constructed in this area. The Awali storehouse office was found to be inadequate and was extended during the year. LANDS There was no change in the reservations or properties held by the Company during the year.15 - TABULATION III DESCRIPTION OF PERMANENT BUILOINOS OONSTITTCTSD ON BAHREIN ISLAND BY THE B'VHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED STATUS AS OF DECEMBER 31. 1945 A W A L I ADMINISTRATION &amp; CAMP AIvIENITIKS No. of Buildings Purpose Size Type of Construction 1 Main Office 14,658 sq. ft.

During the year, a large construction program was underway to provide facilities for the production of aviation gasoline and increased quantities of other products vital to the sucessful prosecution of the war. Certain phases of this program were completed during the year and construction of the remaining facilities was progressing satisfactorily as the year ended. Tabulations are presented, showing: (1) the status of all oil, gas and water wells as of December 31, 1944, (2) the monthly oil production and daily average water production by months during the year, (3) the purpose, size and type of all buildings standing as of December 31, 1944, and (4) the nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity of the.Company at Bahrein on December 31, 1944. The locations of wells, camps, pump stations, pipe lines, roads and miscellaneous facilities are shown on the attached map. PRODUCING FIELD DEVELOPMENT &amp; WELL REPAIR Activities in the Field during the year have been almost entirely devoted to the rehabilitation of those wells which were eliminated as producers in the Well Protection program of 1942. No work of a development nature was undertaken and only minor repair work to individual producing wells was found necessary.&lt;*&gt; - 2 - Progress in the rehabilitation program has been more rapid than was anticipated d, in consequence, the Field has been returned to a state approaching its former degree • flexibility earlier than was originally planned. Thirty-three out of the total of rty-one wells included in the Denial Scheme have been rehabilitated, leaving only eight ills to carry the program to completion. Among the wells remaining to complete the tiabilitation program, some will contribute but little to the output of the Field, and hers will require extensive work-over in addition to rehabilitation before being turned to production* One rehabilitated well was found, on return to production, to require major pairs and has been mudded off pending an opportunity to carry out the necessary work.

The rehabilitation of secured wells has corrected irregularities in the drainage pattern from the producing horizons by the provision of additional points of withdrawal over a greater area. Many of the wells returned to production, however, show marked decreases in productivity and further work will be necessary before their ability to produce is restored to that prevailing prior to the Denial Scheme. GAS INJECTION The injection of gas into the First and Second Pays has continued throughout the year without interruption; the gas for this purpose was produced, as in past years, from the Fourth Pay. The rate of injection, which is designed to control the advance of extraneous water into the oil bearing horizons, was increased in November coincident with the increase in the oil production rate. The ratio of the volumes of gas injected into First and Second Pays remained constant throughout the year at a value which has been found suitable for present reservoir conditions. EDGE WATER ENCROACHMENT Water production for the year averaged 877 barrels per day as compared with an average of 595 barrels daily during 1943. The tabulation of oil and water production data (Tabulation II) shows the daily average water production by months. The erratic rate of increase of water production indicated by the monthly figures is the result of the return of wet wells to production in the rehabilitation program. The majority of these wells are situated on the flanks of the structure- 8 - 4 ► and formally produced water in varying quantities. A similar erratic reduction in water production was shown when these wells were eliminated in 194-2. Individual well data indicate normal rates of increase of water production and information derived from rehabilitated wells suggest a satisfactory water encroach ment on the flanks of the Field, TABULATION II MONTHLY OIL PRODUCTION &amp; DAILY AVERAGE WATER PRODUCTION BY MONTHS Total Production Daily Average 1944 of Oil Water January 562,091 Bbls. 775 Bbls.

The five oil gathering stations, which have a combined capacity of 25,000 barrels per calendar day, have been in continuous service without major alterations or additions. A considerable improvement in the rate of corrosion of the oil collection and delivery lines has become evident since all buried lines were exposed approximately two years agoZ1LLAQ. TERMINAL (Arabian Crude) Total Imports of Arabian crude amounted to 1 % \yi net barrels during the year and this quantity was handled through the Zellaq marine receiving facilities. Zellaq Terminal equipment was augmented in 1942 to permit the handling of Arabian crude at the rate of 40,000 barrels per operating day in the event that it became necessary to supply greatly increased quantities of Navy fuel. These demands did not materialize and up to the present year the terminal has been operating very much below that capacity. With the increase in crude requirements brought about by the new construc tion program, the existing equipment has been overhauled and augmented as a temporary measure to increase handling capacity to 45,000 barrels per operating day. In order to achieve this rate it has been necessary to install a 10,000 ft. loop of 8” pipe in the existing twin 6' pipe line to the Refinery. The Zellaq receiving facilities will become obsolete on the completion of the 12 n crude line which is at present under construction from Arabia to the Refinery. GENERAL The segregation of the Bahrein and the Arabian crude systems was effected on December 5, 1944, and has been permitted by the provision of additional crude measuring and storage tankage at the Refinery. Any co-mingling of Arabian and Bahrein crudes now takes place after separate measurement for royalty purposesmanufacture 10 RgyiKKKY ABBA. During the year under review a total of 13,739,872 barrels of crude was consumed In the Refinery. Bulk export shipments of the various products, including bunker deliveries, were as follows:- Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Oil Fuel Oil Total 3,904,051 Bbls. 1,857,416 ' 2,409,790 ' 2.179.610 ' 10,350,867 Bbls. ▲s previously mentioned, a large refinery construction program was in progress during the year and was still underway when the year closed. The new equipment is largely directed toward the production of aviation gasoline to the extent of approxi mately 6,000 barrels per day, together with increased quantities of other products. In addition, miscellaneous changes were made to certain of the existing plants for Improvement in operation and increased throughput. The following sections covering refining facilities are therefore divided into: (A) plants operating prior to 1944 and, (B) new plants completed or under construction in 1944. A - PLANTS OFgRATIHG PRIOR TO 1944. CRUDE DISTILLATION UNITS H03.1 fc 2 These units, with a nominal capacity of 17,000 barrels per calendar day each, f operated during the year processing blended Bahrein and Arabian crudes. The only structural alterations consisted of line changes and additions re quired to tie these units in with the new crude stilling and gas recovery equipment.

STABILIZER This unit operated in the normal manner until September when it was shut down for structural changes required to convert this equipment into an integral part of the V new gas recovery plaint. SULPHUR DIOXIDE TREATING PLANT During January three new pumps were installed in the following services:- 1. Raw Distillate Feed 2. Sulphur Dioxide 3. Cold Distillate These pumps replaced smaller units in the same services to increase the capacity of the plant. Nominal capacity of the plant is 4,500 and 8,100 barrels per calendar day when feeding water white and standard white distillates respectively. No other additions were made to the Plant which operated normally during the year. LEAD SULPHIDE TREATINC PLANTS The gasoline and kerosene plants in this group operated normally during the year, sweetening gasoline and kerosene production at required rates. No alterations were made during the year. CLAY VAPOR TREATING PLANT This plant, which has a calendar day capacity of 6,700 barrels, operated normally during the year feeding acid treated cracked naphtha for the production of motor gasoline. A larger regulator valve and run-down line were installed during May to increase the capacity and eliminate some of the difficulties encountered in pumping out the bottoms productACID TREATING PJ The gai calendar day op&lt; The ke] kerosene extras out.

The kerosene extract plant also operated normally throughout the year feeding kerosene extract for Power Kerosene production and only minor alterations were carried out. The nominal capacity of the kerosene extract plant is barrels per calendar day. ACID MANUFACTURING PLANT The original nominal capacity of this plant was 20 tons of per day. The installation of the aviation gasoline facilities necessitated the installation of new acid manufacturing and concentration plants which are discussed later in this report. In addition to these new plants, the capacity of the existing plant has been increased to 25 tons per day. The plant was shut down for approximately three months to carry out the necessary alterations and was returned to operation in September. Operation following these alterations has been entirely satisfactory. REFORMING UNIT One structural change was made during the year, consisting of the installation of necessary piping and connections on the furnace to permit cleaning the coke from the tubes with steam and air, accompanied by application of heat by controlled firing of the furnace. Previously the cleaning was done at the expense of considerable labor using air-driven knockers. This plant has a nominal capacity of 6,500 barrels per calendar day, reforming heavy straight run gasoline at essentially maximum severity.13 - &gt;OWKR PLANT Increased power requirements for the new aviation gasoline facilities necessi tated the expansion of steam and power generating capacxwf. A new power plant is being milt in the south of the refinery and, in addition, No.l Power Plant was expanded by the installation of the following equipment 1. A new 3000 K.W. turbo-generator set complete with necessary auxiliaries. 2. A new 2300 volt 4-panel switchboard and 2300 volt reactor. The boiler feed water system was expanded by replacement of the three hot-well pumps with larger pimps and accessories. 4. Three new Westinghouse evaporators and auxiliary equipment. 5. Additions to the water treating plant chemical mixer, chemical and water miscellaneous meters and valves. , including a pressure filter and pimps, backwash tanks, and 6. Extensions to cooling water and condensate lines and steam headers, and the Installation of miscellaneous meters and regulator valves. 7. Extension of the Power Plant generator set and related building and basement to house the new equipment. The new steam lines were placed in service during August, and the new generator et was put into operation during September. With the addition of these facilities the lent now has a nominal rated capacity of 11,000 K.W. RACKING PLANT This plant is composed of two Dubbs cracking-coking units each having a ominal onarge capacity, when operating to produce so-called liquid coke, of 6,800 arrels per calendar day. The units operated normally during the year with the xception that both coking sections were down for considerable periods for major ©pairs to coke chamber linings and insulation. Alterations made during the year consisted of the following:- 1* The installation of two new 5-stage centrifugal hot oil pumps to replace the old reciprocating pumps. The existing turbines were altered and reused. 2. The Installation of additional condensers and condensate pumps to handle the increased steam requirements for the new pumps.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001c1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3881</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001c1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3881</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/146 'Oil: Bahrain Petroleum Company: Annual Reports.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-01-11T22:20:00</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (382 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 383; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
