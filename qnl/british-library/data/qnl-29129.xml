My Lord, I have the honour to inform you that my American colleague informs me that the Iranian Government are contemplating trying to arrange a plan for purchases in the United States of America to the value of some $60,000,000 over a period of three years. Mr. 7 ,ngert enquired of the Prime Minister, who raised the question, whether these purchases wo Tld depend on United States purchases in Iran and was informed that, while the Iranian Government realised that the United States of America could not consent to a clearing agreement, they hoped that it might be possible to be made from Iran up to approximately the value of the goods bought from the United States of America by Iran. The Prime Minister also said that the Iranian Government would like United States help in the development of Iran’s mineral resources (Please see in this connection my telegrams Nos. 217 and 16 of the/^^ 2^nd December 1939, and 19th January 1940 respectively). 2. Mr.. Engert tells me that he does not regard these proposals very seriously. Me has been here three years and has not even been able .to conclude a commercial treaty because of the Iranian Government's views on the balance of trade. His doubts, moreover, seem justified in view of the fact that an The Right Honourable The Viscount. Halifax, K.G., G.C.3.I., G.C.I.U., etc. , etc., etc. , FORSIGN OPTICS, z Hoan American offer to supply cement was recently turned down on the ground that it was ’'too late'; the only consolation given being to the effect that the Iranian Government might consider the American offer, if satisfactory, if and when further quantities were required. 3.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 50 of the 4th May, I have the honour to report that the l nited States Charge d’Affaires has informed me that notice of renunciation of the Amiranian Oil Company’s concession in Iran has now been given to the Iranian Government. Mr. Engert added, in strict confidence, that the Iranian official to whom the notice was given immediately remarked that it was doubtless British influence which had led the Amiranian Oil Company to withdraw. 2. Mr. Engert told me in a previous conversation that the parent company in the United States had lost so heavily in Mexico that it was not inclined to risk further losses in Iran. He told me that the Amiranian Company had so far spent about 2 million dollars here. 3 No announcement regarding the renunciation of the concession has yet been made in Tehran. The secret is being well kept. In view of this I should be grateful if Mr. Engert’s communication might be treated as strictly con fidential until a public announcement is made, or the fact becomes public in some other way. 4.

The United States Charge d 1 Affaires informs me that such modifications as have been made in the texts have been exclusively for the purpose of bringing the Persian translation into harmony with the French text, and that the latter is binding, 2. Notices appeared in the '’Journal de Teheran' of the 10th and 11th March that the two laws had been initialled by the Shah and passed by the Prime Minister to the Ministry of Finance for execution. 3. The month’s delay since ratification by the Majliss had given rise to some comment, some of my colleagues believing that the Soviet Government were incensed and making difficulties. The United States Charge d’Affaires considers that the concessions may now be regarded as having been fully and constitutionally awarded. 4.

'X' £ Sir, S’ 0 # 4 5$7 Tehran, January 2%, f(*49 ~ WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 8 and 10 of the 18th and 23rd January C- respectively, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the French text of the Bill which has been introduced into the Majlis, granting concessions to two American companies for exploiting any oil-fields which may exist in North- East Iran and for the construction of a pipe-line to carry oil produced in these fields. I have been informed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that the Ministry of Finance have stated that the French text is authoritative. 2. The main points of interest in these two concessions have been summarised in my two telegrams under reference. It will be seen that the concession of the Amiranian Oil Company follows very closely that granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1933. Many articles reproduce almost textually articles in the latter concession. For instance, article 18 of the new concession provides, as does article 16 of that of 1933, for the progressive employment of Iranians and for the training of Iranians in the United States of America. An interesting new pro vision is that in article 25 requiring that the majority of the shares of the Amiranian Oil Company should be held by Americans and Iranians, and that the board of directors should consist only of Americans and Iranians. 3. The Tehran representative of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has been away at Abadan, possibly on business arising out of the new concession, and I have therefore had no opportunity as yet of discussing with him the effect which it is likely to have on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The new American com pany seems likely to affect the business of the older concern mainly as a competitor j for the internal market in Iran. But this is expanding so rapidly, and the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company have so long a start in the development of an efficient distributing organisation, that I do not think that the latter have any great cause , for concern. Further, the two American companies must pay to the Iranian Government in all 5s. per ton of oil sold in Iran or exported, as against 4s. 9d. paid by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In any case, the fact that the American interests concerned have arranged for the creation of a separate company to exploit the pipe-line suggests that they are interested at least as much in oil to be obtained in Afghanistan as in Iran. 4. In view of the present exchange position of this country, it is perhaps somewhat surprising that the Iranian Government demanded no immediate cash payment. It is, in fact, possible that they may receive nothing at all for five years. No doubt the American financiers represented by Mr. Hart refused flatly to make any payment now. It is perhaps worth recording a remark made by the French Charge? d’Affaires to a member of my staff to the effect that the concession would be very welcome to the Shah, since it would give the United States a political and economic interest in Iran, and effectively prevent any return to the old dual control by Great Britain and Russia. 5. I have the honour to enclose a sketch-mapf 1 ) showing roughly the boundary of the new concession. As only ten places are mentioned in a line of over 800'miles, the map can only be approximately correct. 6. I should add that, on the 25th January, both concessions were submitted t 0 the Budget, Economics and Foreign Affairs Commissions of the Majlis, which are reported to have passed the text £ c after the necessary modifications. ! ’ The Bill was discussed by the Majlis on the 24th January, when it was stated that these modifications affected only the translation of the text, and involved no change of substance.

A map showing the area in which the concession is granted is attached.^) The company must, within three years of ratification, choose two provinces in East and North-East Iran, and must, within fifteen years, choose within these provinces an area, or areas, of not more than 100,000 square miles. Exploration must begin within six months, and boring within eighteen months, of ratification. The Iranian Government will receive— (а) 4s. per metric ton on petroleum sold in Iran, or exported. (б) A sum equal to 20 per cent, of the sum distributed to ordinary share holders after deduction of a sum equal to 5 per cent, of the capital invested by the company in Iran. Minimum payment of £300,000 per annum is guaranteed from the end of fifth year after concession, rising to £600.000 at end of the fourteenth year. No mention is made of any immediate cash payment. (2) The pipe-line concession provides for the constitution of a separate company known as the Iranian Pipe-Line Company of United States. This company will have the right (not exclusive) of constructing a main pipe-line in any part of Iran, provided the rights of other companies are respected, and tributary lines to connect the main line with other lines in Iran or neighbouring countries. p) Not reproduced.

Sir, With reference to Your Excellency 1 a despatch No. 1941 of the 31st ultimo addressed to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of which has been received by me, I have the honour to report that local opinion is not very favourable to Mr. Hart and Mr. Clapp, especially the latter who is stated to be of the type of eccentric inventor, and it is thought that they have no conception of the difficulties of completing and maintaining a pipe line in Afghanistan. 2. As far as I can ascertain the concession includes territory in the Asterabad-Khurasan Provinces in Northern Persia which T believe to be part of the territory which at one time formed the subject of negotiations between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Persian Company, and subsequently between the Persian Government and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which latter Company is not only the most dependable of all American companies but is the most friendly disposed to British oil interests. 3. The mention of Mr. Ogden Mills as a financial supporter of the Inland Exploration Company of New York gives rise to the surmise that the concession will be sold to the highest bidder in due course, since Mr. Mills is not particularly interested in financing projects unless they promise him a quick turnover and a substantial profit. His Excellency The/ The Honourable Eir Ronald Lindsay, PC. , GCMG. , KCB. , CVO. , ETC. , ETC. , ETC. , British Embassy, Washington, D. C.The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey is accordingly studying this particular project with some interest, especially as there is reason to 'believe that petroleum exists in Afghanistan and that the natural, although difficult, route for a pipe line would be through the Khyber Pass to Peshawar. Advisers of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey are urging caution and recommend a waiting policy, but at the same time they are apprehensive lest Mr. James A. Moffett, who is disliked intensely on account of his personal character, as well as on account of the success he is making out of the Bahrein Oilfields, gets ahead of them, possibly with the financial help of Mr. Kenneth Kingsbury, President of the Standard Oil of California, who happens to be seriously ill at the present time but may continue for many years yet to harass the officials of his sister Standard Oil Companies. 4. T believe that the suggestion has been made that, if the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey succeeds eventually in purchasing the concession, it may be willing Oil to share it with the Anglo-Iraniar/Company which, it is supposed, would be advantageous to both British and American interests.

My dear Collier, Afghanistan. With reference to previous correspondence on the question of the possibilities of oil in Afghanistan, there has been a further rather interesting development follov/ing on the grant of an oil concession in that country to an American concern. This we think has a bearing on the discussions which took place at one stage between Mr. Hart and H. M. Representative in Afghanistan about the means for getting any oil which might be discovered in commercial quantities out of the country. Apparently Mr. Hart and his friends are now looking to the possibility of getting their oil out through Iran. It is understood that the same interests which secured the oil concession in Afghanistan have secured two concessions from the Iranian Government. One appears to be primarily an oil concession and the other a pipeline concession. I have obtained particulars of these two concessions from the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, end I enclose a copy for your information. The terms laid down by the Iranian Government follow pretty closely those included in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession. The geographical position of the areas covered by the new concession are, however, not nearly so favourable as those of the Anglo-Tr»anian Company and according to our Information the oil prospects a^e not nearly so promising. The terms of the new concession must therefore be regarded as relatively considerably more onerous than in the case of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Anglo-Tranian and Shell Oil Companies still consider the/ L * Collier, Esq. , CMG. , Foreign Office, S.W.l.2. the prospects of Afghanistan as very speculative and likely in any event to be an expensive proposition. T recently saw a representative of the Gulf Oil Company (Mellon Group) who knows that par»t of the world. He was more optimistic than our friends here about the possibilities of finding oil in considerable quantity, but he admits that it is likely to be an expensive job. He suggested that if oil is found in Western Afghanistan it is the intention to carry the pipeline north-west to the Caspian and then southwards to a point between Bushire and Bander Abbas. This would be a good deal west of Charbar which was mentioned by Mr. Hart in his talk with Fraser Tytler - see despatch No. 60 of 2nd May, 1936. The lengsh of pipeline cannot well be less than 1,000 to 1,200 miles and I believe that considerable expense will be involved with pumping. We shall be interested to hear in due course what H.M. Representative in Afghanistan is able to report on the whole proposal and we should like to have any information he can obtain about the terms of the Afghanistan concession. Perhaps you would let Rendel see this letter in view of the references to Tran. I am sending a copy to Rumbold of the India Office. Yours sincerely, 3gd. F.C. Starling.The/ COPY. 21st January, 1937. Information received from Tehran by cable indicates that two separate Concessions have been granted by the Iranian Government: The first to a Company which will be called the Ami rani an Oil Company (of Qe lav/are; on the following conditions: (a; Duration of the Concession will be 60 years. (b) The territory of the Concession is indicated in the attached sketch map and approximates to 200 , 000 square miles.

Sir, Tehran, December 24, 1936. j“2// HIS Majesty’s Minister at Kabul in his despatches Nos . 60 and 86 o f the * — 2nd May and 25th June, 1936, respectively, had the honour to report to you on the recent activities in Afghanistan of Mr. C. C. Hart, formerly American Minister at Tehran. Later Mr. Hart passed through Tehran on his way to Europe and, as he stated that he had business at Geneva, Mr. Loxley informed Mr. Makins of his plans in a letter, dated the 15th September last, of which a copy was sent to Mr. Collier. 2. Mr. Hart, again accompanied by Mr. Clapp, is now back in Tehran and a few days ago gave the chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran the following account of his activities : He said that he had signed a concession with a representative of the Afghan Government about the middle of November in Berlin, and that he was now on the point of signing a concession with the Iranian Government. Mr. Butters did not gather exactly what area was covered by Mr. Hart’s alleged concession here, but thought that it was approximately the north-eastern part of the country. According to Mr. Hart, the American company would spend four years drilling in different territories, and the payment of royalties would only begin in the final quarter of the fourth year. Mr. Hart did not say what rate per ton had been fixed as royalty, but stated that after eleven years the minimum royalty would amount to £1,800,000 per annum. No cash payment was apparently being made for the concession. A pipe-line would be constructed to Charbar on the Persian Gulf, and for its final 300 miles it would serve both the Iranian and the Afghan oil-fields. Mr. Hart said that he was backed by the Texas Oil Company, certain Californian oil interests and various outside groups who had agreed to provide finance. One of these was the Fisher Company, who are, I understand, manufacturers of motor-car bodies, another was the Dodge Motor Company or a group connected with them, and a third Mr. Butters understood to be composed of certain Dupont interests. 3. I report the above, for what it is worth, as being Mr. Hart’s own version of his activities. On the face of it much of his story seems improbable and Mr. Butters regards it with extreme scepticism. Mr. Hart is not, I believe, in contact with the American Legation here, and it is doubtful whether he has the support of his Government; and Mr. Butters professed himself very reluctant to believe that the United States Government would be glad to see American capital sunk in an area where there are so many risks of political complications. I have not yet had an opportunity to consult the Tehran manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but I hope to report by next bag any further information which I may be able to obtain. 4.

The Persians are getting into serious financial difficulties over the construction of the railway ana tne idea is that the Belgian Group should come in with an offer of assistance in return for a concession for oil in Northern Persia. The concession would be taken up by the Poyal Dutch-Shell which is a partly British Company ana on good terms with the A.P.O.C. The Persians have been spending fantastic sums on the railway ana the deficit on last year's operations was about £1,800,000. It seems a somewhat doubtful project to invest money in.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 3^2 of the 30th June last, relative to the activities of Mr. C. C. Hart, I have the honour to inform you that he is understood to be leaving Tehran to-day via Bagdad in order to catch the Berengaria at Cherbourg and return to the United States. 2. Mr. Hart having been here for some months living mysteriously in a garden outside the city, suddenly paid quite a series of calls on his old friends two days ago. I was out and missed him, but he found Mr. Mallet at home and told him that he was leaving by Bagdad because his friend, Mr. Clapp, wished to go that way. Mr. Hart intended to spend a few months at home and then return to the Middle East, this time via India and Afghanistan, because, he said, his former trip to that country had only taken him to Herat, whereas now he wished to visit Kabul and the south. Mr. Hart did not talk about the objects of his wanderings, but this was possibly owing to the presence of two other guests of Mr. Mallet. 3 . I learn, however, that later in the day he called upon the general manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia and told him quite a lot. He and Mr. Clapp had, he said, been endeavouring to obtain the northern oil concession from the Persian Government. They wanted a concession for the four northern provinces and had offered to pay a royalty in the neighbourhood of 1,500,000 dollars. The Persian Government had replied by offering the concession for one province only at a royalty of 13 million dollars. Weeks of parleying had ensued, ending with a repetition of the original terms of the Persian Government. Mr. Hart had now decided to go home, hoping, I gather, that later on he might have a better chance. He told Mr. Wilkinson that he was fully aware of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s rights, and had no intention of poaching on their preserves. 4 . I have no doubt that he is interested in the possibilities of oil in Afghanistan. 5. Mr. Hart told Mr. Wilkinson that he had big financial backing in America, but it is not clear from whom. 6 .

He is living in an atmosphere of seclusion and mystery, and his presence here is, he told Mr. Mallet, causing great irritation and embarrassment to his successor. 3. The resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company recently tackled the Minister of Finance directly about the activities of Messrs. Hart and Clapp, and was told that they had indeed applied for a concession for the northern oil- t fields, that is, the small field known to exist around Semnan referred to in aP / paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 48. The Persian Government had asked for ^ y better terms and a further tender was expected shortly. Mr. Jacks then gave Davar a fairly sharp lecture on the folly of listening to such people and incidentally reminded him that under the terms of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession of 1933 the company had still until 1938 to decide what aieas the\ wished to exploit. . . . 4.

A GOOD deal of mystery surrounds the melodramatic reappearance in Tehran, two months after his official departure, of Mr. C. C. Hart, the former American Minister here. 2. The present American Charge d’Aft'aires, who was Mr. Hart’s secretary, professes to be as mystified as anybody by the arrival of his former chief, without evening dress, but with a new motor car, to lodge with the archivist of the Legation. It seems certain that Mr. Hart is engaged on his former profession of journalism, and has, in the course of a rapid passage through England, Germany and the Soviet Union, during which he does not seem to have interviewed any prominent personalities, written up those countries for a group of newspapers which he is representing. His remarks about Hitler are intended to enlighten the American public as to the Fiihrer’s real origin, a case of miscegenation between a rattlesnake and a porcupine. Russia, on the other hand, is, in Mr. Hart’s opinion, a fine country, where everybody has enough to eat, though not too much. As for England, I gather thal Mr. Hart’s articles are likely to consist mainly of sobstuff about Westminster Abbey in the style of the late Horatio Bottomley; while the Irish Free State is dismissed by Mr. Hart in the statement: “ I’m not a believer in any religion, but, my God, those fanatical Papists just get my goat! ” Mr. Hart denies any intention to write about Persia, in order not to embarrass his successor, but Mr. Wadsworth feels none too sure that this virtuous resolution will be maintained, and quite expects that the next Imperial outburst will be directed against the United States of America. 3. Journalism is not, however, according to Mr. Wadsworth, the main object of Mr. Hart’s return to haunts which he loudly hated. Oil is supposed to be his main interest, and the impending arrival of Mr. Clapp, the American oil geologist, who has frequently been employed by the Persian Government, notably last year at the time of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, is supposed to portend collaboration. Mr. Clapp has apparently for many years been attracted by a scheme to exploit the small Semnan oil-field in order to supply Tehran with oil (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 259 of the 14th June, 1930). Mr. Wadsworth believes that Mr. Hart and Mr. Clapp are backed by a big concern, and will attempt to get this concession. They are also said to be interested in the exploitation of oil in Northern Afghanistan. The Afghan Ambassador confirms this, so possibly Mr. Hart’s visit to Herat, reported in Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 271 of the 17th June, 1930, may not have been as entirely innocent as he claimed. 4 . The chief of police, when asked jokingly by a member of my staff what Mr. Hart was doing here, poured out a long and most improbable tale about a carpet designed by Mr. Hart, which a carpet dealer had duplicated and sold to someone else. General Ayrom admitted, however, that Mr. Hart must be engaged in other activities as well. Of course, it is possible that, among other things, Mr. Hart is doing some business in carpet exportation. He had made a large and expensive collection when Minister here, and obviously intended to sell some of it on his return to the United States. 5 .
