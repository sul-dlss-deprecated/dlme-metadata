FOX, D.Sc., F.G.S., M.I.Min.E., late Director, Geological Survey of India, past President, Mining, Geological and Metallurgical Institute of India, and of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal Published by the order of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and Dependencies This Report has been specially prepared for the Sultan of Muscat and Oman after a personal study by the Author of the area from west of Risut Bay to east of Murbat and northwards across the Qara Mountains to Ayun and Hanun Springs in the drainage area of the Ruba’ al Khali or Empty Quarter of South-Eastern Arabia. The Report is largely confined to a Mineral Audit of the known mineral resources of the Province of Dhufar, but includes information relating to other parts of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and discusses mineral and other industrial possibilities. Copies of the Report may he obtained from the Director of Revenues to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, MUSCAT, South-East Arabia, by post Price Rupees Nine or Twelve Shillings or Three Dollars (U.S.A.)FOREWORD At the time of my investigations in the Dhufar province of the Sultanate of Oman the only detailed observations of the Arabian coast between Muscat and Aden regarding its geology, were those of a century ago, restricted entirely to coast lands, including of course the strip from Ras Nus, facing Kuria Muria bay from the west, to Ras Dharbat Ali, at the eastern end of Qamar bay, roughly 150 miles. Similarly, the geographical features of the province, up to a distance of 30 miles or so from the coast, inland from Salalah, were fairly fully recorded, with a topo graphical map by a trained surveyor, half a century ago. Slight additions have been made, subsequently, both to the coastal geology and to the geography of Dhufar, about 20 years ago, by a geologist and an explorer separately. No geologist had previously traversed the Jabal Qara and crossed the Qarn Shaiba country beyond it. There was no published information regarding the economic geology of Dhufar, and, as it requires a field season for a good geologist to map 1,000 square miles of country, and the area concerned in Dhufar was not less than 4,500 square miles (there were no suitable topographical maps of reasonably accurate mapping), it was, in my opinion, best to have a preliminary or reconnaissance survey to collect data. His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, had desired to have a clear idea of the mineral wealth of Dhufar province as early as possible. It was thus evident that a well-arranged tour would yield information on both the structural and the economic geology of the region in question and allow the data to be the basis of an audit, a mineral audit, of the resources of this part of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, as desired by the Sultan. ,. The accompanying Report, therefore, is to be regarded as a Mineral Audit of the Resources of Dhufar rather than as a Report on the Economic Geology of Dhufar, which is the title actually adopted. The Report has been specially written. I have been impressed by the possibilities of an oil-field in the Jabal Qara, as it would seem from the stratigraphical geology that both ‘ source-rocks and reservoir-rocks are present, even if hidden, and that the lower Eocene limestones might be a possible second or upper ‘reservoir-rock’ if these strata are present. The middle Eocene might prove to act as ‘cover-rocks’ for the lower Eocene ‘reservoir-rock’, but that the main ‘ source-rock ’ and ‘ reservoir-rock ’ are much lower in the geological sequence, and might be represented by the argillaceous and marly sandstones exposed in the southern slopes of the Samhan hills facing the Murbat platform. Almost everyone who has visited Dhufar has remarked on the advantages it possesses in climate over' any other part of southern Arabia, and those who have crossed into the Jabal Qara have written in glowing terms of forests and herds and grand country. It is the only portion of southern Arabia which enjoys a dry and a wet monsoon, the latter yielding a rainfall of 25 to 30 inches, at least, on the Jabal Qara, and providing water for several springs which discharge on to the Dhufar plain’s, as well as sending floods down the wadis across the watershed of A 1 Qutun into the bare lands of the Qarn Shaiba to the north. There is a landing ground near Salalah, where is the Sultan’s Pajace, and an anchorage in Risut bay, which was used during the war. His Highness has been the initiator of the investigations I have made, and incidentally provided me with the most reliable local information on the mineral discoveries and water-supply facts, thus showing a greater interest by a Ruler than I have previously met with. To appreciate the condition of affairs in Dhufar the reader should glance through the pages of Southern Arabia by J. T. and M. V. A. Bent (19 00 ) an d those ofpanied by nearly a dozen Sheiks from different parts of Dhufar, largely from the hills and beyond, and that these men were each trying to do more for me than the other, always anxious to help and so to please the Sultan. It was a very enjoyable tour, and I am very grateful to all the tribesmen who so willingly and cheerfullv assisted me. I have mentioned their names in paragraph 33 of the Report, but while all were attentive I should say that I am grateful to Sheik Sail bin Garwah for the extra trouble he took at Hanun, and that I shall always feel grateful to Sheik Hamad bin Salim Almarhoon for many kindnesses, the manner in which he organized the tour and attended to all details, from selecting camping places to collecting samples There are so many to mention—Secretary Mohammad Amin Salim for assisting i n many ways at Salalah; the Governor of Murbat, Sheik Ali bin Salim, for his nice attention while I was at Murbat; Khan Bahadur Ahmed Sheebaily, the Sultan’s Chief Secretary, for accompanying me to the ‘oil’ locality at Murbat to elucidate the various reports by those who had seen or smelt the oil. I have to record the kind hospitality I received from Mr. W. M. Llewellyn and other officers, particularly Mr. M. Clapham, of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, during my stay with them at their hostel at the aerodrome at Salalah and my journeys to and from Salalah in their planes. I am also under an obligation to many friends for special assistance in connection with the Dhufar investigations and the preparation of the Report. Among these are Brigadier G. F. Heaney, C.B.E., Surveyor General of India, for so kindly securing and sending the valuable maps which I had with me. I have to thank Dr A K Dev and Mr. P. N. Mukerjee of the Geological Survey of India for so generously checking and identifying my mineral and fossil collections. I find it difficult to express my appreciation for the analytical work which was done for me, as a specially urgent job, by Messrs. R. V.

GLOSSARY Although I have seldom used the Arab terms and names in reference to geographical details, such as water-holes and rock features, the maps to which reference is made in paragraph 7 of this Report have each a ‘ glossary , and it is from these that the glossary below has been compiled. The actual meaning of a term appears to vary in different places or among different tribes, but it will be seen from the text of the Report, e.g. paragraph 36, that the name Ayun (the plural for Am, a spring) is almost certainly incorrect as used as a place name, and that the correct term should be Gelti (particularly for the water in the wadi at Hanun camp as discussed in paragraph 38). The true springs or Ayun are those of the Garzaz, vSahnut, Rizat, etc. However, a glossary is always useful as the terms are often far more descriptive for local features and the like than any word in English (compare such words as Arq, Huqna, Qauz and Qoz, with regard to 'sand dunes’, or Fula, Gelti, Ghadir, Khafs and Shaqa, in connection with water-holes).

I had realized that the‘Prince’ mentioned by Mr. Thomas [Arabia Felix, 3rd sentence, 1st paragraph of 1st chapter) was no other than the present Ruler, Sultan Saiyid Said bin Taimur, and that His Highness’ full support would be available, but I did not then know that the ‘Sultan’s writ’ really did carry across the Qara Mountains of Dhufar into the Qarn Shaiba. 4. My real reason for advising against an immediate systematic geological survey, while influenced by the possibilities of tribal interference, was that, so far as I knew and could ascertain, there were no topographical maps available on a scale suitable for recording geological observations while mapping in the field. The only maps I have been able to procure have been on a scale of either 1 inch to 31-56 miles (1-014 inches equal to 32 miles) or at best 1 inch to 15-78 miles (1-014 inches to 16 miles). It is impossible to map geological details at all satisfactorily on a map even on the scale of 1 inch to about 4 miles, and a 1-inch-to-the-mile map is generally used. Mrs. and Mr. Bent had a surveyor, supplied by the Government of India, to accompany them merely on their traverses. A geologist must have a map to work with, and so the surveyor must work ahead of him, and the topographical and geological surveys would cover more than six months for an area of over 4,500 square miles. It is about 150 miles from Ras Darbat on the west to Ras Nus on the east along the coast of Dhufar, and over 30 miles in a straight line northwards from Salalah to Hanun, over the watershed of the Qara mountains. With suitable maps available a geologist would take three to four years to complete a detailed map.

Historicae Consideration 8. In an economic report of this kind it would be unusual to discuss questions of ancient history and archaeology, but there are important details, relating to the past trade and industrial activity along the south Arabian coast, which apply to the province of Dhufar of today, and which may be useful in guiding the develop- men Aral imm Bxo&lt; gifts head also spon the (exo cert; cour the to h limif spor Suit held anoi men exisl Thej Adei Can; sout latei Bala reco; Nih; has in tl aftei wad: Hisr Bala chie: in ] ‘ thu Thei othe thes Sabi (Isla clim5 ment of this region in the future. The thread of the history of Arabia is the frankincense trade, which dates back almost to times immemorial. The use of frankincense in 1500 B.C. is mentioned in Exodus (Chap. 30, v. 34), and, notwithstanding the Queen of Sheba’s gifts, Solomon’s imports through Eloth, near Ezion Geber, at the head of the gulf of Akaba, came from Ophir (I Kings, Chap. 9, v. 26, also Chap. 10, vv. 2, 10, 11 and 22). It is believed that Ophir corre sponded with some place on the coast of Malabar, India, and that the coastwise trade followed along the southern coast of Arabia (except during the monsoon period) about 1000 B.C. It seems quite certain, however, that the frankincense was obtained from the countries bordering the Gulf of Aden, largely from definite areas on the Arabian side, by export from certain ports only. This appears to have been established by H. J. Carter (1845-48), who found the limits to be from the Jabal Qamar to the Jabal Samhan, thus corre sponding exactly with the limits of the Dhufar province in the Sultanate of Oman of today. 9. Early in the Christian era, the second century, when Rome held Egypt, historians such as Claudius Ptolemy, Arian or the anonymous writer of the Periplus, and Theophrastus and Pliny, mention such ports along the south Arabian coast where markets existed for trading in frankincense and myrrh and other spices. These included the ‘Arabia Felix’ of the Romans (identified as the Aden of today), ‘ Arabiae emporium’ (recognized as the later Kane or Cana and identified as the site of Hisn Ghorab near Bir Ali, 60 miles south-west of modern Makalla), Manteion Artimidos (of Ptolemy, later occupied as Mansura, and now recognized in the ruins of El Balad near Salalah. The Diana Oraculum near there has been recognized by J. Theodore Bent as ruins of a well in the lower Nihaz below the cavern of Sahaur). The Abyssapolis of Ptolemy has been recognized as identical with Moscha or ancient Murbat in the ruins east of Takah. The name appears to have been coined after the famous precipice a few miles to the north in the Darbat wadi and known now as the Dahaq. Abyssapolis was subsequently Hisn Mirahadh, but it is all in ruins now. It is thought that El Balad to the west was the capital and Moscha to the east was the chief port of the frankincense country. 10. This ‘frankincense country’ of the Bents evidently agrees in position with the ‘libanophorous region’ of Ptolemy and the ‘ thuriferous region ’ of Pliny, and is the modern province of Dhufar. There is no question that there are ancient ruins at El Balad and other places on the coastal plain, Jurbaid, of Dhufar, and that these sites appear to have been used by more than one government— Sabian (sun-worshippers), Persian (fire-worshippers) and Arabian (Islam). In spite of this region being one of the most attractive in climate and fertility along the entire coast of Arabia, and the evidence... % of successive periods of trading activity it has for the past f ew hundred years been a terra incognita to the civilized world. This is clearly due to the character of the tribes who inhabit the plains and the hills (Qara mountains) and the adjacent areas to the east north and west. It has been the chief complaint of all explorers that, unless the hospitality of the Sheiks is secured, it is impossible to travel inland. In my opinion a great change is in progress, as I shall show later, and I think actual communications will be the main problem and not a very difficult problem.7 :o the east, U explorers impossible egress, as I vill be the II. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Hills and River System 11. A glance at any of the maps that have been referred to in paragraph 7, more particularly the A.A.F. Flight Chart, Salalah, Arabia to Jiwani, India, No. 108, 1 : 1,000,000, and those of G.S.G.S., Asia Sheets, 1 : 1,000,000, of 1945, shows a strip of high ground, attaining elevations of upwards of 3,500 feet and in places roughly 4,000 feet, extending westwards from Ras Hasik (on the west side of Kuria Muria bay) for 150 miles beyond the longitude of Ras Dharbat ‘Ali (roughly 53 degrees East). In the east this high ground makes the Jabal Samhan, the steep southern scarp of which overlooks the gneissic plain of Murbat from the north. In the middle the upland region is called the Jabal Qara, which rises abruptly from the 10 miles wide coastal plain of Dhufar, but falls away far less rapidly to the north into the Nejd. To the west, the watershed merges into the Jabal Qamar. Except for two re entrant valleys—one at the west of the Jabal Samhan and the other to the east of the Jabal Qamar—most of the rain precipitated on the elevated land mentioned above has a northern run-off. The rocks exposed along the watershed are limestones of bedded formations which appear to slope (dip) to the southward along the southern side and to the northward along the northern side of the Qara mountains in Dhufar. 12. According to the maps provided by Bertram Thomas and the Bents, the rivers or wadis flowing to the sea in Dhufar south of the watershed of the Qara mountains or A1 Qutun are, from the east, as follows: the Fulk north-north-west of Murbat; at least three unnamed wadis between Murbat bay and the Khor or lake of Rori near Takah; the Darbat into the Khor or inlet of Rori; next the Tabraq followed by the Hamran, and then the important Rizat wadi which continues south past Mahmulah to Rizat on the coast. West of the Rizat there is some confusion of names and courses (in the maps). Bertram Thomas recognizes three tributaries —Sa’a Sakh, Raithot and Thidot—as coming together above a water- hole or pool at Sahalnaut, and some miles below this the stream (presumably as the Sahalnaut) is joined (from the w r est) by the Arbat. He also shows two tributaries from the north to the wadi Darbat, both joining the main river somewhat north of the lake of Darbat (in the valley above the travertine cliffs or abyss of Dahaq). The next wadi west of the Arbat is the Garzaz, and then, draining\ i I 8 2 eastwards from west-north-west of Risut, is the wadi system ’of the Nagar Ghaiz. None of these streams is actually perennial, judged on a visible flow of water, but there seems to be a subterranean flow seawards in some cases. 13. The only explorer who appears to have travelled in the region north of the watershed, previous to my tour, was Mr. Bertram Thomas. He recognizes the following wadis westwards from about longitude 54° 30' E.: wadi Dhahibun from near Dhikur, with two tributaries—the Ingudan and the Ghazal; next the wadi from Hanun known as the Rakibit; then the wadi through Mughagha water-hole called the Dauka with its two west tributaries the Istu and the Hauf; then comes the wadi through Ayun named the Ghudun with a tributary from the east—the Haluf, and another lower down from the west—the Ghara. All these wadis are dry in the cold weather and hot months. Although I visited the pool of Ayun and sat in the cave overlooking it below the dry waterfall, I was unable to get the name of the wadi (the Ghudun of Bertram Thomas). Then on my way to Hanun I crossed an important wadi known locally as Heelah (which may be Bertram Thomas’ Dauka). Again I could get no name for the important wadi in which Hamm (camp) occurs, but it is the Rakibit according to Bertram Thomas’ map. I travelled eastwards from Hanun and encountered a large wadi in which is the Thenut spring but in this case not under the dry waterfall where there is a cave. This may be the wadi Ghazal. 14. Eastwards from the Thenut spring wadi there is an important wadi known as the Zaq, the rock-bed of which shows the scour of flood water. There is a pool in the bed which may be called Zaq and the wadi may have another name which I failed to discover. J“ e camp was at Har’at under the cliff of a wadi below a dry fall, but there was no water. It might be the Ingudan wadi 'T^rtram Thomas). Eastwards again is an important wadi in which there is a large pool under a dry waterfall and in front of a cave. The place is called Obet, but later was given as Eeyath. It belongs to the Dhahibun wadi system. Finally, almost on the watershed, A1 Qutun, at Nissa (Na’Sah) camp the valley opens northwards. The most astonishing feature of these north-flowing wadis is the abundant evidence of flood discharges. Below the pool at Ayun across the wadi the width is 250 feet with flood water signs 4 leet above the bed, and I reckoned a discharge of over m ion cubic feet in 12 hours only. At Hanun the evidence was similar and a 12-hour flood, on evidence there, indicated upwards mi ~ 0 5! C1 ikic feet. I have already remarked on the scour v dence of the Zaq, but the wadis of the Thenut and Obet camps bedslnfbod ^ arge vo ^ umes °f water have passed down their 15. lands, 1 30 incl: June ai the rail restrict! very su highlan part of drainag is uncei times b as regai difficult every y and the slopes c of run-c 16. flows nc (waters] from tti there is and act slopes, flat anc slopes i valleys water w very sei water, subtem into a 1 carries : tufa or the Dai above it 17. north, e under d time the2 9 RainfaUv and Run-off stem of the tial, judged ranean flow lied in the Jr. Bertram :rom about , with two wadi from Mughagha &gt;—the Istu named the id another are dry in he pool of vaterfall, I ►f Bertram rtant wadi s’ Danka). ich Hamm a Thomas’ ed a large not under the wadi ire is an shows the i be called &gt; discover, low a dry dan wadi wadi in front of a ?yath.

There are no reliable rainfall records for the Qara high lands, but it is estimated that the average rainfall is approximately 30 inches, falling mainly in the wet or monsoon period between June and September. In the plains to the south, along the coast, the rainfall is probably not more than 5 to 6 inches annually, again restricted to the wet months, but in addition to rain the plains are very subject to wet mists during the rainy weather. In the Qara highlands a heavy dew is also to be reckoned with during the early part of the winter months. North of the highlands and over the drainage into the Qam Shaiba and onwards to the Nejd, the rainfall is uncertain and I was given to understand that there might some times be no rain for two or three years. While this o might be true as regards the actual fall of rain on the ground surface, I find it very difficult to believe that floods do not come down the wadi courses every year. The evidence of heavy floods is too clear to be mistaken, and the fact that these wadis have their sources well up the northern slopes of the A 1 Qutun makes it certain that they tap large volumes of run-off rainfall from the rain-belt of the Jabal Qara. 16. It is difficult to assess what proportion of the rainfall flows north, but assuming equality of precipitation on the A1 Qutun (watershed) and the presence of deeper valleys into the mountains from the south, my observations incline me to the view that, while there is a considerable run-off to the north, the losses by evaporation and actual percolation into the ground are greater on the northern slopes. On the other hand, seeing that the limestones are almost flat and full of joints and solution cracks and holes; and that the slopes and hillsides carry grass or light forest, and also that the valleys are deep and well into the highlands, large quantities of water will sink into strata and re-appear as springs (that is without very serious losses by evaporation and percolation). The percolating water, by dissolving the limestone and enlarging the cracks and subterranean channels, has converted the flat tops of the A1 Qutun into a typical karstland. The emerging spring and seepage water carries much carbonate of lime which is precipitated, as calcareous tufa or travertine, in almost every southern valley. The Dahaq in the Darbat wadi is in fact a natural dam of tufa, and the valley above it is now also filled up with this material. Springs and Lakes or Khors 17. All the water-holes I saw in the Qarn Shaiba tract to the north, except the spring under the cliff at Thenot camp, are pools under dry waterfalls (and usually associated with caves). In flood time the hollows must be well scoured, and indeed at the dry waterfall10 2B &lt;** # # and cave at Thenot the hollow is seen but the water has evidently leaked away under the wadi floor. The same is true also of Har at same n camp where there are tumbled masses of limestone below the dry’ require waterfall (no cave there). At Obet there is a large pool (as well as G f the a good cave) and a small spring feeding it, although the waterfall is appear dry. I have no data as to the degree to which the pools shrink, but astonist at Ayun and Obet there are bulrushes and a little marsh suggesting only se] that the pool in each case, while subject to overflooding, does not sand, greatly contract during the dry period from October to June even 20. when the weather has become very hot. In these cases the pools a centu are sheltered by the shade of the cliffs. The water was always cold or lake and usually without a trace of salt. Ayun and Obet gave a slight fall of muddy taste, Hanun was definitely salt but still drinkable by a hurried thirsty man. • Zaq was slightly salt, but the Thenut spring was cold khor wa and sweet. At Hanun the bedded limestones on the sides of the anchora wadi tasted strongly of salt (along certain layers). that th 18. There are pools (evidently spring-fed) and springs in nearly fortifica every large stream flowing seawards to the plains, Jurbaid, of city wa Dhufar, but only within or on the very edge of the hills or spurs. If this i This was true of the Nagar Ghaiz west-north-west of Risut, but we sand shi had to go nearly 8 miles up to find the pools within the hills. In the of fresh case of the Garzaz, about 9 miles north by west from Salalah and water t] almost on the edge of the plains, there is a fine spring. There is El Bala really more than one spring, but they emerge from the limestone at in the 1 that point and, at the time of my visit the flow, into an aqueduct, subterra was somewhat more than 1-25 cusecs. This is regarded as a safe the plai average until the rains come and the place becomes a lake, due to siderabl flood water, as was the case when the Bents visited the locality at 21. an earlier stage after the rains than my visit. This 1-25 cusecs means that con nearly 30,000 gallons an hour or roughly 800,000 gallons a day of Sa’a Sal lovely cool freshwater. It is enough for 32,000 people at 25 gallons its sourc a head.

In the valley of the Nihaz, just before it enters the plains, There is is the locality known as Ghaur Fazal, which was indicated as being (at the o the site of Dianae Oraculum, but even the Bents were not quite this pla&lt; convinced on this point. However, in 1895 he gave the hole a within t depth of 150 feet and a diameter of 50 feet, while Bertram Thomas the Riz; estimated 100 feet for the depth and 20 feet as the diameter.

The I did not water at conclude 1 shaped w during # the rains and in doing so, the escaping air might emit sounds in the same manner as the ‘oracle’ at Delphi in Greece. Such places require study, not a few minutes’ visit, perhaps at the wrong time of the year. However, neither the Garzaz nor the Nihaz wadis appear to point in the direction of El Balad, and yet there is an astonishing freshwater pool or khor there close to the seashore and only separated from the sea by a narrow strip of coastal (beach) sand. 20. The ruins of El Balad were fully described by H. J. Carter, a century ago, but I do not think the full significance of this khor or lake of freshwater, at sea-level and influenced by the rise and fall of the tide, has yet been thoroughly appreciated. My very hurried examination of the ruins led me to believe that the present khor was connected with the sea, and was used as a kind of sheltered anchorage as well as a moat for the fortified city. This would mean that the water was sea-water. The existence of wells within the fortifications suggests that freshwater was secured, even though the city was surrounded by a moat and ditches filled with sea-water. If this is true then in the years which have elapsed since a spit of sand shut in the khor or inner part of the moat, the outward seepage of freshwater from underground percolation has so diluted the sea water that no salt taste can now be detected in the water of this El Balad lake. If therefore the Ghaur Fazal marks a ‘sink-hole’ in the limestone, then this El Balad khor marks an emergence of subterranean water which has come from the hills, Jabal Qara, under the plains, Jurbaid, for 10 or more miles, and come in very con siderable quantity. 21. The next river system to the east of the Nihaz wadi is that comprising the Arbat and the tributaries—Thidot, Raithot and Sa’a Sakh—which make up the Sahalnaut. The Arbat almost has its source in the spring of Khiyunt far into the Qara highlands, and the Thidot also begins at a place marked Ain which means and marks a spring. At Fuzah on the western side above the Arbat there is a spring (badly fouled by cattle) near the dwellings, but there is good water in the Arbat immediately below at the spring of ’In. There is a freshwater pool in the Sahalnaut wadi of the Bents’ map (at the outfall of the Thidot according to Bertram Thomas). I visited this place and should say it was a good spring in the big wadi, within the hills, between the Arbat (or Aqbat Sheik) gorge and the Rizat (Ar Zat). There is a considerable loss by leakage, but the flow in a cemented aqueduct near the pool was not less than 3 cusecs (nearly 2J times that of the Garzaz spring). It is also led across the plain for irrigation and a very considerable loss is evident, because, about 4 miles along from the pool, my measurement m the open channel gave little more than | a cusec. The leakage must travel in the general direction of Dahariz, so that, between the12 loss from Arbat and the Sahnut or Sahalnaut there would be a pos- sibility of the percolation converging on the khor at l i b ala . 22 In the Rizat wadi there is a great spring which keeps a laree oool fairly full and even overflowing just within the hills. I beheve the place is called Mulwah Al’Aud or is just above it, and south-west of the hill known as Jabal Nashib. Here the discharge at the time of my visit, was no less than 18 cusecs or 6 times that of Sahnut. It is a true underground river, and the water is led out or irrigation to Mahmulah and beyond in one direction and to Hamran in the other. I checked the volume in one place near Mahmulah, 5 miles from the pool, and found the quantity less than 9 cusecs. The loss of 50% includes the water tapped off for the cocoanut plantation 2 miles north of Mahmulah. East of the Rizat wadi there are springs in the next two wadis—-the Hamran and beyond the Tabraq—each said to yield one cusec in the hot dry months. All these waters are fresh and cool except the Sahnut or Sahalnaut which takes the overflow of the pool, and the water was warm m com parison with the others. At Murbat water is obtained from shallow wells in the wadi close to the town, but the water is saline and unattractive. . ^ u 4 . 23. Between Murbat and Rizat lies the wadi Darbat which drains the slopes on the north-western side of the Jabal Samhan as well as the southern slopes of the eastern end of the Jabal Qara. This important wadi discharges into the sea near Takah and has on its way out of the hills, an elevated valley with a lake nearly 2 miles long. The lake appears to lie in a valley which has been filled up largely by deposited calcareous tufa or travertine. The natural dam of this tufa is to be seen in the cliffs over 500 feet, known as the Dahaq in the main valley, and the Murgha in the side valley to the west. These cliffs—the Murgha abyss and the Darbat abyss of Bent—represent the precipitation of upwards of 50 million tons of travertine. At present, at the time of my visit, the discharge of water from the top is probably not more than 2 cusecs and the fall, 550 feet, is largely fine spray by the time it touches the southern base of the precipice. There must be considerable percolation under the bed of the dry wadi between the Dahaq and the lake or khor Rori (or Ruri) just before its outlet to the sea at Inqitat (Khatiya of Bent). Unlike the waters of khor El Balad which are sweet, the waters of khor El Rori are slightly saline. 24. According to the sketch-map accompanying Bent’s paper of 1895 the khor El Rori is nearly 3 miles long, although its outlet to the sea west of Khatiya island is newly silted. During the last 50 years much has been altered. The khor is very much smaller as a sheet of water, and the mouth of the estuary is now completely closed by sand along the beach. This is also the case with El Balad, but there the khor water is fresh, although not fed by any visible13 wadi, but it shows that the underground flow must be strong at the latter place. Indeed the entire area westwards from El Balad to beyond El Hush appears to have seaward percolating freshwater as is evident from the numerous shallow wells used for giving water to the groves of cocoanut trees (palms) along the coast at Salalah. This might be a reason why El Balad of old (and Salalah now) was selected as the capital and Moscha as the ancient anchorage (now dis appeared as such). I believe there are other freshwater khors of small size along this Dhufar coast as well as springs up the wadi courses, such as the northern tributaries—Ajarthun and Ghazot which make the Rizat (Ar’Zat). I was, however, assured that there were no springs in the Arbat other than Khiyunt at its head. 25. A word must be said in regard to the landing ground at Salalah, about 3 miles north-north-east from the Sultan’s Palace, and the tube-well installed there. There is no wadi, and the tube-well (with 2 |-inch discharge pipe) is about 60 feet deep and encounters water at 43 feet from the surface (which is approximately 43 feet above high sea-level). This water is very slightly but dis tinctly saline, perhaps due to the well being 17 feet or so below sea- level, but I do not think there is any such direct connection with the sea today. If the boring could have been put down to intercept the water known to be seeping to the sea, I am certain that a far better quantity and quality of water might have been obtained for the requirements of the personnel and other purposes at the aerodrome at Salalah. It is to be remembered that the rainfall on the Jabal Qara watershed, taken as covering 10 miles by 80 miles, is roughly 12,800 million tons or, say, 256,000 million cubic feet. Half of this is discharged northward to be lost in the Nejd, and the remainder southwards. Of this remainder, perhaps 25% is lost in evaporation and absorption, while another 35% goes underground to re-appear in springs. Thus 40% probably represents the flood discharge during the rains. This is about 51,200 million cubic feet as flowing water down the wadis to the sea; much of it must reach the sea, but large quantities may be lost by absorption into the ground where the wadis cross the plain of the Jurbaid. CUMATE AND COMMUNICATIONS 26. On the A1 Qutun or watershed of the Qara region there is usually a cold day wind between November and February, and the nights are colder even in the wadi camps in the Qarn Shaiba, unless sheltered from the wind. Along the coast plain or Jurbaid, south of the Jabal Qara, the climate is very pleasant, warm by day and cool by night in February. The climate throughout Dhufar gets very hot by May and June when the rains come. Then every thing is suddenly changed. The dry hot air becomes warm and——&gt;• r humid. Mists hang over the Jurbaid until late in the afternoon, or by tl all day and night, while it is raining on the hills which are wrapped trade in clouds. The temperature in the plains (Jurbaid) rises as high as from 117 degrees Fahrenheit at the end of May and falls to 90 degrees at any the end of June with a high humidity. The rainfall on the Jurbaid offer; is probably not more than an average of 5 inches for the four months— Risu June to September. There is no rainfall in these coastal plains stear between October to June, and the temperature may be as low as mak&lt; 70 degrees in January in dry air conditions. It is very much better so u: in the hills, but there may be some winter rain on the Jabal Qara shelt in the cold weather months of December and January. Dhufar is also the only section of southern Arabia to experience a typical south-west emei monsoon of the kind normal to India, particularly the Western was Ghats and the Deccan plateau. 27. The reason becomes evident from a study of the coasts of able the Arabian Sea and western Indian Ocean, namely, that Somaliland so fa shelters the Gulf of Aden on the south and so removes the possible close conditions for a wet south-west monsoon for the area of the been Hadhramaut even though it has elevations up to 6,000 feet. East- it m ward in the Sultanate of Oman there are two areas of highlands— no i the mountains of Dhufar including Jabal Qamar, Jabal Qara and of tl Jabal Samhan with elevations up to 3,500 to 4,000 feet, and the date mountains of Oman behind Muscat—including the Eastern and expc Western Hajar with Jabal Akhdhar rising to nearly 10,000 feet (in sea i the peak of Jabal Sham, 9,900 feet). Between the mountains of favo Oman and those of Dhufar there is a wide belt of low desert (the to t south-eastward extension of the Ar Rimmal {the Sands), which 300 includes the Rab’al Khali {empty region), of south-east Arabia. the The coastal strip from the hills of Ja’Alan (40 miles south-west of gulf Ras A1 Had) for nearly 375 miles (including the island of Masira 250 and the gulf of Masira and Sauqira and Kuria Muria bays) has no plan highland behind it higher than 750 feet on the average, if that much. Jiw; Thus a strong moisture-laden wind from the Arabian Sea off the land Somali coast will encounter high lands only in the mountains of perl Oman on the one hand and on those of Dhufar on the other, and on 1 will yield moisture, as rain, in these two areas and not on the country air ; between them. 28. In addition to the south-west monsoon, the mountains of Oman also have rain from a north-east monsoon similar to the eastern highlands of Madras. Part of this north-east monsoon may yield the winter rains of the Jabal Qara and adjacent highlands of Dhufar. It was due to the strong south-west monsoon that the coastwise traffic between India and Arabia was affected in earlier days, and this probably made waiting at some coastal port of southern Arabia necessary for sailing vessels. That such was the case in ancient times is now well known and was made evident in the case of Dhufar 1415 □on, or by the ruins of El Balad, etc. There seems to have been an inland rapped trade route also from Dhnfar northwards from El Balad (and today high as from Salalah) by way of the Garzaz wadi, but I am not aware of :rees at any further particulars. On this Dhufar coast the bay of Murbat urbaid offers anchorage during the north-east monsoon, and the bay of ►nths— Risut is a good anchorage during the south-west monsoon for plains steamers (as proved during the war). Risut bay would probably low as make a good landing place for flying boats and was, I understand, better so used during the war. Khor El Rori might make an even more d Qara sheltered hydroplane base, if properly attended to. Mention has ufar is also been made of the landing ground near Salalah, and there is an ;h-west emergency landing ground just east of Murbat (which fortunately Western was never found necessary). 29. While the Salalah landing ground is to be kept in a service- asts of able condition (and it has a long ‘ Run-way ’) the commercial traffic aliland so far maintained by British Overseas Airways Corporation has been &gt;ossible closed down. This is perhaps a necessary proceeding if there has of the been little traffic by air between India and Aden and Abyssinia, but East- it makes Dhufar more difficult of access as there is, so far as I know, ands— no regular steamer service to this coast. Arab dhows carry most ra and of the little sea-borne trade that there is at present—Salalah imports nd the dates and simple things required by a poor and wild people, and u and exports cocoanuts, frankincense, etc. The distance to Muscat by r eet (in sea must be quite 750 miles for a dhow and take at least 3 days with ains of favourable winds and weather (even by steamer). The Sultan, it is rt (the to be remembered also, possesses the port of Gwadur, with about which 300 square miles around it, on the Mekran (Baluchistan) coast.

DETAILS OF TOUR Arrival and Halt at Salalah 30. Plans having been made for a Mineral Audit of Dhufar with the approval of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by mid- January, 1947,1 left Calcutta by the B.O.A.C. flying boat ‘Hanwell’ (Captain Brand) on the 2nd February, from the Hooghli river at the Willingdon Bridge, in a non-stop flight to Karachi. The course was over Surguja, Saugor and Udaipur, and then across Palanpur, along the northern margin of the Great Rann of Cutch to the air port at Karachi, where we arrived about 7 p.m. (I.S.T.). Next morning, leaving from the Karachi aerodrome in a Uockheed plane, ‘Fake Edward’ (Captain S. T. Beal), we flew south of the Baluchistan coast as far as the longitude of Jiwani and then turned south-west for Masira island (where we stopped for a short time after a 3|-hour flight over 674 miles), and then continued to Salalah ( 2 J-hour flight over about 400 miles) and arrived there early in the afternoon. As we left the Indian coast from Cape Monze I studied the strike of the outcrops of rock and thought that the general trend was to the south-west with south-east dips. There is a small island at the tip of the cape. The strike of the beds is by no means steady, but is in curves, convex to the south and east. According to E. W. Vredenburg’s map (Plate 12, Records, Geological Survey of India, Volume XXXVIII, Part 3, 1909, ‘ Report on Jhe Geology of Sarawan, Jhalawan, Mekran and the State of Eas Bela’) the strata from Karachi to Cape Monze are middle Miocene, Gaj beds (upper Aquitanian), overlying Nari (upper Nari or lower Gaj) beds of middle to lower Miocene (Aquitanian to Tongrian) which occur in a wide outcrop down the valley of the Hab river, and appear to swing westwards. The beds underlying the upper Nari are the upper Kirthar of upper Eocene age, so that the lowest Miocene and Oligocene are missing. Below these Kirthar limestones there seems to be another hiatus as the next beds below are upper Cretaceous (Campanian to Neocomian) in age. 31. On arrival at Salalah I was met by Mohammad Amin Salim, Assistant Secretary to the Sultan. He informed me that the Sultan, Saiyid Said bin Taimur, was already in Salalah and I gladly arranged to call at the Palace that evening. This I did and His Highness indicated his desire to have an accurate knowledge of the mineral resources of Dhufar seeing that its climate was so temperate and this fact with good mineral resources might encourage the opening up o It w mine the v I wa rock colle with wliei note Pleis Katl Evai (Kat Socu by 1 a fos are thicl 1 in furn ston plair varie the 1 the I flat Sam Spec item alonj 10 p exac17 (v Dhufar / mid- mwell ’ ' at the :se was , along 3 ort at arning, ‘Lake :histan :h-west IJ-hour r flight n.

I was further informed that a number of specimens of minerals and rocks had been collected from various places in Dhufar and that this collection was at my disposal for examination. I took them back with me to the British Overseas Airways Corporation transit hostel where I was, staying. On my way, both to and from the Palace, I noted the Miliolitic limestone at Salalah. These Pliocene to Pleistocene strata (of believed Eolian origin like those I had studied in Kathiawar in Oklia, and previously very fully described by J. W. Evans in his paper ‘ Mechanically-formed Limestones from Junagarh (Kathiawar) and other Localities’ in th.e Quarterly Journal, Geological Society, London, Volume 56, pages 559 to 589, 1900 (and first noted by H. J. Carter nearly a century ago in his paper ‘On Foraminifera in a fossilized state in Arabia, Sindh, Kutch and Kahttyawar’ in 1849) are of considerable interest. The beds, in strata 12 to 18 inches thick, are from 12 to 20 feet thick and dip gently, 5 degrees or, say, 1 in 12 , seawards (south). They are used as building stone and furnish excellent material (freestone) for this purpose. It is the stone found in all the ancient ruins, El Balad, etc. in the Jurbaid or plain of Dhufar along the coast. 32. I spent the next morning, the 4th February, studying the various specimens of rocks and minerals which the Sultan had taken the trouble to have collected. These were, without exception, from the Murbat area and from the metamorphic and gneissic rocks of the flat country along the southern side and at the foot of the Jabal Samhan scarp. They are as follows:— (i) Weathered biotite (black mica) in pieces 2 inches across. (ii) Hornblende (amphibolite) schist. (iii) Garnetiferous granulite with small pink garnets and quartz. (iv) Quartz with hornblende and biotite (but largely quartz). (v) Quartz granulite evidently from banded gneisses. (vi) Amphibolite schist resembling (ii) above. (vii) Chloritic schist with mica ? (viii) Argillaceous sandstone of sedimentary origin. (ix) Shale with carbonaceous laminae adhering; and (x) Lead ore, largely galena with some carbonate attached. Specimens (i) to (vii) clearly belong to the gneisses and schists, items (viii) and (ix) to much newer strata underlying the limestone along the southern side of the Samhan range. Sample (x) of about 10 pounds indicates a mineral lode in some limestone rock, but the exact locality of this or the other specimens was not recorded in18 . iii t been prepared for specimen (ix) from I writing on the labels. ^ ^ ^ tl \ e gamhan Hills in File 528, he r ^ ord of the Geological Survey of India, which I ieg.

Early in the afternoon we continued up the wadi for perhaps a mile or two and then climbed up the northern slope for perhaps a thousand feet to a small spur, from which a peep is obtained of Salalah in a south-easterly direction, barely 12 miles away, in a straight line. On the hillsides around occur horizontal beds of limestone. We continued north into flatter, rolling country with fewer trees and shrubs, and finally into open upland as we went higher. We passed a small encampment (thatched stonewall shelters near some caves) and, perhaps an hour or so later, approached Kazmeem, where we were to camp for the night. It was already dusk, but I noticed a change in the rocks at this highest point, chalky-looking limestones for the first time. We camped just over a small saddle to be out of the cold wind, but it changed in the night and next morning, as we prepared to go on, the wind was from the north, cold and annoying. 35. On the previous day’s traverse, except for the tufa at and around the entrance to the gorge of the Garzaz spring, the rocks all the way up to the high open upland were bedded limestones, often nodular, and frequently but not very conspicuously showing solution phenomena. When nearing the highest point at Kazmeem there is a beginning of curious white powdery or chalky limestones. I thought at the time they might be chalk, but similar material has proved to be pure dolomite. From Kazmeem our path or track lay north west and downhill, with trees still showing in sheltered places, but after about 5 miles the country ahead changed in appearance, and showed brown and reddish brown to khaki coloured strata. These rocks correspond to a bare countryside of rolling hills, which are composed of limestones and calcareous beds, dipping northwards and north-westwards in a great curve. They thus give the impression of overlying the whiter looking limestone in the higher ground to the south (towards Kazmeem). When I got to these younger-looking, brownish coloured strata, I found they were limestones (probably impure) with associated clayey beds. The appearance of fragments of chert and flint, also of fibrous and granular gypsum and of calcite makes these formations appear entirely different from those facing the plains of Dhufar. It is to be noted that the exposures now. seen ( 6 th February) beyond Kazmeem are in the northern, arid drainage area. As we continue north-west, descending slowly, there is more and more evidence of chert and flint and gypsum as debris on the surface and in the dry wadi bed. The strata appear to dip more steeply than the ground surface, but it is difficult to say if higher beds are really being met as the dips are not regular and the beds roll about structurally. 36. It had been planned that we should go to Hilah (Heelah) but Sheik Salim (Almarhoon) had persisted in going first to Ayun and so we continued north-west and came to the gorge in which is20 the pool of Ayun. On the way and while among these brownish coloured limestones and shales I found the casts of several arge gasteropods, but they are poor specimens with little or ^ ^^menta tion and useless for identification. The climb down into the Ayun gorge is quite 300 feet, if not more, and the beds appear to be wholly of limestone. The dips-are southward. The pool is quite 200 feet long and 100 feet across and deep, although the water is clear green rather than blue. The drop along the wadi bed to the pool must be 150 to 200 feet (as a cascade when flowing). There was no flow at the time of my visit, but there was evidence of flood water quite 4 feet deep in the flat bottom valley below the pool. I reckoned for a width of 250 feet and a depth of 4 feet and a speed of 1 2 feet per second, that a flood lasting only 12 hours would discharge at a rate of 1,500 cusecs. This means a total flood of about 64,800,000 cubic feet in 12 hours less or more according to the velocity of the flood current. The cave on the east of the pool is large and not due to solution by the water, nor is it artificial, but probably due to scour when the level of the wadi floor was much higher. I could not get accurately the name of the wadi in which the A&gt; un pool occurs. This wadi flows northwards and might be the Ghudan ol Bertram Thomas’ map. 37 . From Ayun we retraced our steps for some miles and then camped for the night in a small sheltered valley. The place, is known as Ha’Khi. It is among the brownish beds (limestones with chert and gypsum) among which fragments of the rock show forammi- fera resembling nummulites. Again we had arrived at dusk. Karly the next morning (7th February) we marched off (apparentH to please me) in a hurry, then retraced our steps for a mile or so and struck east for about two miles before turning north and crossing a line of hills to emerge on a wide and desolate plain, quite flat and nearly 3 miles across (said to be Haklee). Then, after another 2 miles, we descended quite 200 feet over flat-lying bedded lime stones into a wide wadi called Hilah (Heelah). The plain (Haklee) was lightly strewn with small fragments of chert and chalcedony. On the cliff side into the Hilah I saw casts of large lamellibranches but with only traces of ornamentation (also some large gasteropods), and unlikely to afford any specific identification. The beds are, I think, upper Eocene (Kirthar), but their age will be dealt with later. There was also a certain amount of gypsum seen as veins of satin-spar and as granular gypsum in the cliff exposures. There is no trace of tufa either at Ayun or in Hilah wadi. From the Hilah we crossed another low line of hills and struck north-eastwards for Hanun across country differing completely from any encountered so far. 38. It is an extensive, bare and flat plain with rock showing or just under the surface. At half-mile or greater distances there21 A^nish large Lenta- Ayun )lly of ) feet green must ) flow quite :oned, | feet e at a 30,000 of the ot due lue to could a pool ian of d then [ace is :S with amini- Early itly to so and ssing a at and nother L lime- laklee) edony. anches )pods), . are, I t with eins of re is no ilah we rds for mtered howing s there were isolated conical hills of about the same height but of small extent, resembling earth-pillars somewhat and suggesting that each represented the remnant of a single formation, as so many outliers. Next the plain itself was bare but cut by flat-bottomed ravines, in the sides of which almost horizontal beds were exposed. In most of these exposures, usually 2 or 3 feet under the top layer of lime stone, there was an absolutely white bed resembling chalk, some times 3 feet thick and often of much greater thickness. And so we came to a specially wide and deep ravine or wadi, in the sides of which there were successive beds of white, powdery or chalky lime stone. We descended into this wadi to camp at the water-hole of Hanun, a pool in a deep channel of the limestone floor of this wadi. It was already dusk and cold with a wind up the dry wadi from the north. Next morning ( 8 th February) Sheik Sail bin Garwah left for Haloof Dhar (Ath’Air?) to bring me specimens, while I made an examination of the sides of the wadi in which lies the Hanun water. It is definitely salt but not nauseatingly so, and would be appreciated by very thirsty people. The water is esteemed by the people, but I could not show the same appreciation and drank from what I had brought from Ayun (although that has a slightly muddy taste). 39. The signs of flood water at Hanun indicated a stream over 3 feet deep and perhaps 400 feet across. This section with an assumed velocity of 1 J feet per second gives a discharge of 1,800 cusecs, which if maintained for 12 hours represents a volume of nearly 72,500,000, cubic feet or 450,000,000 gallons, or somewhat greater than that of Ayun. In the morning light the sides of the wadi are a snowy white with the chalky strata well exposed. The height of the plain above the wadi is perhaps 120 feet, and near the top the' chalk ’ bed (it is a pure dolomite actually) is characterized by containing irregular concretions of flints, separate but parallel to the bedding. Irregularly shaped flints also occur in the bedding plane. In both cases the flints vary from 5 inches to large masses up to 12 or 15 inches in length, and are closely associated with the porous-looking granular-textured ‘chalk’ (dolomite) in which they occur as segregations. They have all the appearance of secondary development and, indeed, the dolomite itself seems to have been formed in situ from an original (fossil) limestone, after the marine deposit was exposed to weathering by percolating meteoric waters. It appeared to me that in this Qarn Shaiba region, the processes might still be in progress under the surface. 40. The limestones below the ‘chalk’ (dolomite) bed, which is 6 to 7 feet thick, are harder but with friable-looking surfaces from which casts of fossils, large gasteropods and echinoids, project (these are not easy to extract without damage). Associated with these fossils are numerous nummulites. In a lower bed of similar22 r i limestone, also with many nummulites, I secured fragments which next r have a distinct salty taste. Below this again, well down the section stony of these horizontal beds of limestone there is a particularly friable climbe bed, even powdery, with loose small nummulites fallen out, strongly to yot impregnated with salt. It is difficult to say if the salt is residual in from the marine deposit, but so it appeared to me. It is the gradual Hills i removal of the salt that seems to give the rock its granular structure stony and powdery nature (by loss of cohesion). The salt in the water of difficu the Hanun pool below is thus clearly accounted for. beds £ 41. The surface of the open, stony plain at Hanun is probably or so no more than 2,000 feet above sea-level and therefore 1,200 feet or 4 so below the watershed near Kazmeem. The top bed of the wadi is A1 Qi a khaki-coloured limestone, 3 feet thick perhaps, but hard and so dips \ overhangs the friable chalk bed (the ‘chalk’ with flints included). and si It also contains some veins of gypsum (and I found loose fragments It is of vein salt). On the surface of the plain there is scattered a slight considerable quantity of flint and chert fragments, as well as anoth blackened fragments of sandstone and limestone, together with the b: pieces of fibrous gypsum, loose crystals of worn calcite and round- is at 1 sectioned, geode-like crystalline quartz. The commonest material the p is flint and chert with now and then a little chalcedonic silica. This the a debris continues on the plain for miles, and appears more conspicuous witho near the outliers of conical hills (some are flat-topped), which are so bath much a feature of the scenery. And so we travelled eastwards to cave Thenut, a wadi similar to that of Hanun, but there is here only a scour great hollow below the dry waterfall and just below the cave.. All the tribui water has gone down into the limestone and left great blocks of stone Arab', in the hollow where the pool should be. However, at the base of those the west (left) cliff, near a little show of green vegetation and a little photc downstream, there is a small spring hidden in the wadi side. This Then water was not only cold but quite the freshest I had tasted since whicl leaving the Garzaz spring. The beds are flat-lying bedded limestones we ai (as at Hamm). ^ 42. While examining the cave and beds at Thenut, the men upwa (with Sheik Sail bin Garwah) from Haloof Dhar came bringing climt specimens of fibrous gypsum, fibrous rock salt, fine white ‘chalk’, bran&lt; and what looks like pure kaolin. We then continued east-south-east we h across similar country and crossed another wadi, the Zaq, with a grapl scoured limestone floor (as evidence of strong flood action). It was and ; dry, of course, but a little downstream below a dry waterfall there is to cz a pool of slightly salt water (which my party like). It is about nortl 2 ^ miles on to the next big wadi, Ha’rat. There is no pool under into the dry fall, and no cave, as all has collapsed and large blocks of Na’S limestone cover the bed, and it is possible water could be found by Al Q digging 50 feet down. There is no water there and Ha’rat is dry, with but cold at night, in early February. We continued south-eastward all a23 next morning (9th February) and in doing so gradually crossed the stony plains (with outliers of conical and flat-topped hillocks) and climbed slowly to a higher level (above the tops of the hillocks) on to younger strata of the same limestone series. After about 5 miles from Ha’rat we began to approach the northern edge of the Qara Hills (Qutun) and continued to rise slowly by steps and across bare stony plains and also across occasional wadis. These are always difflcult, due to the steps made by the successive flat-lying limestone beds as well as to little pillars of limestone (which stand up 18 inches or so as a result of solution or erosion). 43. We turned east, fairly close to the main northern slopes of A1 Qutun, at a place known as Kach’um. Here the low northward dips which have been present all the way from Hanun become flat and show a southward inclination along an east-west axis at Kach’um. It is therefore a low arch or anticlinal trending east-west, with a slight overall inclination of the arched strata to the west. After another 5 miles or so we came to a large wadi, up which we found the big pool of Obet (Hay’Ath). It is surrounded by tall reeds and is at the base of a dry waterfall. There is a cave immediately above the pool on its south-west side, and a spring just beyond and below the cave. The water is not cold and has a slight muddy taste but is without a trace of salt. It was warm at noon and all the men had a bath in the pool. We drew water from the spring. Here again the cave is eroded out of a bed of limestone, evidently a part of the scouring by the stream when in flood. We appeared to be among tributaries of the Dhahibun wadi (see Bertram Thomas’ book Arabia Felix, 1932, page 140, but his names do not agree with those given to me by the same kind of people as those depicted in his photographs, notwithstanding that they are Sheiks and Saiyids). There is a climb of about 500 feet out of Obet (Tay’Ath ?) southwards which leads on to open upland like that south of Kazmeem, and so we arrived on the northern margin of A1 Qutun (or Jabal Qara). 44. The slope of this upland is to the north, so we continued upwards in travelling southward. X should mention that, on the climb out of Obet, I found casts of large gasteropods and lamelli- branches similar to those on the descent to Heelah, and I feel sure we have the same strata in each of the cliffs referred to (see para graph 37). In another miles over open upland with some grass and a few shrubs now visible, we arrived at Niccha or Nissa (Na Sat) to camp at dusk. This is a shallow valley which drains into the northern system of. wadis of the Qam Shaiba which carry flood water into the Nejd. Next morning (10th February) we left Nissa or Na’Sat and crossed a grass and scrub covered upland on to the real A1 Qutun or watershed of Jabal Qara. It is again typical karstland with limestone showing like the teeth of a miniature tank barrier all along the gently sloping surface, which now takes the run-off24 e southwards as well as underground. We were now travelling west and south-west and had gone for perhaps four hours (nearly 9 or 10 miles), still largely on uplands of grass and shrubs before we reached wooded valleys opening southward, and had a glimpse of Risut bay far away to the south-west. The vegetation on the slopes was never thick enough to hide the outcrops of the bedded limestones. These strata are seen to be undulating in gentle arches (anticlinals) and troughs (synclinals) as the curves of the outcrops are easy to trace. 45. And so about midday we arrived under some fig trees near a water-hole or spring well up the hillside at Otak (Othk). The water is dirty, due to cattle standing and drinking in the pool. 1 understood that there was water in the valley below, but I was unable to get the real name of the valley or the exact position of the reported pool or spring in it. From Otak we crossed the valley in a southerly direction and again emerged on open upland with grass and shrubs almost dangerous to walk on because of the irregular solution pillars of limestone, 12 to 18 inches high and spaced barely 2 feet apart in any direction. They are not at first visible because the dry grass is also about 18 inches high. Practically all the run-ofi rain must be trapped, or at least hindered, on such karstland and much of it must ultimately take an underground course through the worn cracks and joint planes in the underlying limestone. After perhaps 4 miles (from Otak) we began a long gradual descent south- south-east. In this descent of perhaps 1,200 feet I collected a few typical samples of the limestones. Some were fine textured and crystalline, others almost of the texture of lithographic limestone, and others with veins of silica (some quartz) and appearing siliceous. The analyses show nearly all the specimens to be very high grade (pure) limestones, with little magnesia or silica. 46. About 4 p.m. we had descended to the foot of the hills, then deflected eastwards and entered the valley of the Rizat a mile or so below the big spring. I believe the actual place is called Mulwa Al’Aud (but this may be a mile lower down the valley where I finally camped). The Rizat (or Ar’Zat) spring feeds a large pool and I was not able to see from where the underground water enters. There is an abundance of tufa around the pool and downstream along the Rizat wadi, and the water is conducted in a channel along the eastern side of the wide stream course. My measurement of the flow near the pool, in the aqueduct or prepared channel, gave about 18 cusecs (roughly 64,000 cubic feet or 400,000 gallons an hour). It is a river almost capable of providing 40,000 people with 25 gallons a head a day. At present this water is carried out to the plains for irrigation purposes and no use made of the fall from the spring to Mahmulah which must be over a 100 feet and should yield about 120 kilowatts of electrical energy at Mahmulah (i.e. before the water is seriously used for irrigation).

During the rains the Rizat will carry floods of great magnitude and the wadi will have a stream for some weeks after the end of September, but that is all excess and could be conserved. 47. Next morning (11th February) I went south to Mahmulah to meet the Sultan at his 'shooting camp’. On the way I noticed that the aqueduct had been tapped to irrigate a small grove of cocoanut palms, which it did generously. I took measurements near Mahmulah and found the channel carrying less than 9 cusecs (or half the amount that it takes off near the pool). Much of this loss is due to tapping for the cocoanut grove above Mahmulah, but an appreciable amount is certainly due to leakage. I gave His Highness a brief report of my tour and explained that I could not go into details until my specimens were analyzed and properly examined or identified. He was very interested and showed me some more samples that had been collected while I had been on tour. These I examined with the Sultan after breakfast, and then I drove to Murbat to continue my investigations there, particularly with regard to a reported occurrence of oil in some brownish argillaceous sandstone on the shore of the bay north of Murbat. The Assistant Private Secretary, Mohammad Amin Salim, came with me, but after seeing me properly housed in the Sultan’s guest house he returned to Salalah, whither the Sultan had returned. I was not able to follow the geology while driven by car; I shall return to this matter when discussing our return journey from Murbat on the 13th February. The Sultan’s chief officer at Murbat is Sheik Ali bin Salim. He was soon with me and explained that the Galena (lead ore) locality was Garat Athetate, but it was more than a day’s journey away and the man who knew the locality was ill of pneumonia. 48. We visited the 'oil' seepage, but the tide was wrongly timed and the place was awash. However, I examined the rocks and we calculated the best time for our further visit. This would be about 9 a.m. and we decided to come on the 13th. Meanwhile I examined the low hills immediately north of Murbat and was very surprised to find metamorphic rocks—impure marbles, serpentinous material, amphibolite and some gneissose granite—very mixed up, but having a general north-east to south-west strike and north westerly dips. Both the strike and dip varies in short distances. South-east of these low hills (Jabal Ali?), there is a wadi from which the people of Murbat get water in shallow wells less than 12 feet deep, but the places are dirty and the water is saline. Between this wadi and the town, south and eastwards, there are exposures, perhaps 8 to 10 feet thick, of Miliolitic limestones. These rocks are quarried for building purposes. The main part of the rocky plain east of Murbat, on which is the Emergency Landing Ground, consists of banded gneisses trending almost north and south and practically&lt;F vertical or with high westerly foliation dips. There appear to^ be alternations of mica schist and quartz granulite as well as ‘sills’ of pink to red medium grained granite. It is a worn-down gneissic plain, but quite distinct from the metamorphic rock in the Jabal AH hills, immediately north of Murbat. 49. The view northwards from the Sultan’s guest house at Murbat, over the Jabal Ali in the near distance, has the southern scarp of the Jabal Samhan as the most conspicuous feature. It is quite clear that the bedded Hmestones which make up perhaps the upper 1,200 to 1,500 feet of the 3,600-foot scarps lie unconformably on the reddish coloured strata below. The limestone bands have a distinct tilt to the west, while the reddish coloured strata appear to be horizontal and the upper layers are gradually cut away westwards. These reddish coloured beds are probably 600 feet thick and include sandstones and flaggy beds, and are underlaid by khaki to greenish coloured shales and earthy, warve-like sandstones which together are quite 1,000 feet. I went about 4 miles along the road back to Takah and at the first marked rise in the road encountered the greenish-buff shales (which resemble those of the Takhirs in being sphntery, but are not ‘needle shales’ which are the type rocks of the Takhirs). Overlying these shales are massive slab-like Hmestones. The strata appear to dip westwards but there is a definite south component in this inclination, at least in the limestone as it runs down to the first headland of Murbat bay (coming away from Murbat). Next I turned north to climb the face of the Jabal Samhan from a point bearing 130 degrees to Murbat and 145 degrees to the cape south-west of Murbat. The view south-east looks across the bay, and the compass bearings are practically true as there is very little magnetic variation along this part of the coast of Arabia. 50. I cHmbed to the shoulder which forms the head of a large valley opening south-east and about 1,000 feet high, all the way up on Hmestones which slope south-west. In the scarp facing the valley mentioned, the khaki-coloured shales are seen high up and continuing round into the scarp of the main Jabal Samhan. This estabHshed the fact that both the Hmestones and the lower, dis cordant, argillaceous strata occur in an anticlinal at the valley and that this arched fold has a general tilt westwards. The samples are of the overlying limestone of the lithographic type but I could not find any fossils. H. J. Carter noted such ‘lithographic limestones’ here a century ago, but he has also, in his revised paper of 1856 (published in ‘Geological Papers on Western India’ in 1857), recorded several fossils, foraminifera, gasteropods, etc., from the Hmestones of the Murbat scarp, which make the basal Hmestones of Cretaceous (Senonian to Cenomanian) age and the approximate equivalent of the Pab sandstones and associated strata just south of Gadoni, 28 miles north-west of Karachi. The impression I had gained from 26 3 B27 ;zv* ; my tour was that the limestones of the Jabal Qara were of middle to upper Eocene (not lower than Lutetian) or equivalent to the Kirthar of Sind. There would thus be a hiatus between the limestones on Jabal Samhan and those of Jabal Qara, which requires attention stratigraphically as well as structurally in the geology of Dhufar. 51. I concentrated my attention on the lower strata and came down the valley to the south-east from under the main scarp of the Samhan hills north-west of Murbat. The khaki-coloured splintery shales are underlaid by earthy sandstones and these beds appear to dip westwards and to belong/to the same series as the sandstones on the shore of Murbat bay where the ‘oil’ was found. If this is correct then an anticlinal feature is present because the sandstones of Murbat bay definitely dip south-west into the sea at 5 to 10 degrees. There may be a strong fault between the sandstones and the meta- morphics of Jabal Ali near Murbat, since at the ‘oil’ exposure (north side of Jabal Ali) the sandstones trend north-north-east and dip at 70 degrees westward near their contact with the metamorphic rocks, but in a few yards the strike becomes north-north-west with only 15-degree westerly dips, and at the ‘oil’ locality, a few yards further west, the strike is north-west to south-east and the dips south-west at from 10 to 5 degrees. I found no fossils in any of the beds exposed in the Jabal Samhan scarp facing Murbat (the western part of this important scarp). Nor could I recognize more than the following two sets of strata—an upper series of limestones perhaps 1,500 feet thick with lithographic limestone in the basal section, and a lower series of brown to greenish coloured strata with an argillaceous facies above and earthy sandstones below (with some reddish gritty beds at the junction between the two series, but probably belonging to the lower and not extending to the westward limit of the scarp face). 52. On the morning of the 13th February, accompanied by Khan Bahadur Ahmed Sheeb Ali, I went to see the ‘oil’ occurrence on the shore of Murbat bay north of the Jabal Ali. The beds involved are argillaceous sandstones, brown in colour and with a little mica present, in beds 12 to 18 inches thick with thin shaly partings between the successive beds. The tide was out (and rises 5 to 6 feet when high). As may be imagined with such rocks, covered at full and exposed at low tide, the possibility of a slight oil seepage remaining at one spot for years is unlikely unless the seepage is strong. Those with me insisted that oil had been noted and found (by soaking up in a cloth and squeezing into a bottle) which smelt strongly of ‘kerosene’. I was unable to detect any definite smell of petroleum, and from the position of the rocks and their structural and stratigraphical consideration I was inclined to the view that a tin or barrel of oil had come ashore and leaked on these rocks and left traces of oil which observant fisherfolk would soon notice. However, the case is ‘ non-proven ’ and will be discussed28 on a later page when dealing with the larger problem of oil in Dhufar. Before leaving Murbat I had made further efforts in regard to certain samples of carbonaceous shale which had been received in the Geological Survey of India 40 years ago, but no specimen was produced although the Sultan had shown me a few fragments at Salalah. The locality has probably been forgotten, but I feel certain that such material will be found below the limestones perhaps near the eastern end of the Jabal Samhan. 53. I left Murbat on the afternoon of the 13th February accompanied by Mr. Pradhan Singh, the State Civil Engineer, and Messrs. M. Clapham and W. M. Llewellyn of British Overseas Airways Corporation. I now had an opportunity to watch the rock exposures, and it was soon evident that the limestones of the Jabal Samhan were inclined gently westward and also dipped in a southerly direction (as would be the case in a tilted anticlinal). We went up the Darbat wadi to the Dahaq or wall of tufa. It is quite 500 feet high, and there is a similar though smaller ‘ abyss ’ to the west where the Darbat had probably overflowed when dammed by the main deposit. We next climbed the western side and visited the ‘lake’, a long narrow sheet of water probably a mile and a half long and 300 to 400 feet across, and curving into the valley. On the way back we could see the Khor Rori sheet of water shining in the sun. It is not now as large as 2 miles long, but it is a good sized lake and could perhaps be improved, but the water is saline. Next I noticed the Miliolite at Takah resting on the older limestones, and so we continued to Hamran and Mahmulah and then towards Dahariz and El Balad and Hafa and thus to Salalah and the aerodrome. There are exposures of Miliolite limestone almost all along the coast, but outcrops of the limestones of the Jabal Samhan are not conspicuous, and indeed after Takah it would be difficult to distinguish those of the Jabal Qara from those of the Jabal Samhan without close mapping and the evidence of fossils. 54. On the 14th February Mr. Pradhan Singh and I visited Risut and he pointed out the position of the salt pans between Augad or Okad and Risut on the edge of the bay. Next we went up the valley west-north-west from Risut. It discharges into the marsh at the west of the bay. We struck the Nagar Ghaiz wadi about 5 miles from Risut at a place where there is a 30-foot cliff of con glomerate of recent origin (showing that the streams are in a reju venated condition now). After going 4 miles up the wadi we enter narrow valleys and here is the first water. Just round the bend there are hard greenish trap-like sandstones and phyllites (slatey shales) trending north-north-west with a very high dip (75 degrees) to the west. Veins of fibrous gypsum 6 inches wide occur along the bedding of the phyllites, and a fault striking east wards with an almost vertical shear is seen at the same exposure.29 The shear zone is 18 inches across and is full of flaky carbonaceous shale, which suggests crushed coal seams or the residue of bituminous material (oil). The men with me stated that the Alum shale (which I had really come in search of) was only a little further on through the Ansarit gap, but they had been saying this for the past 3 or 4 miles and it was quite impossible to get an accurate idea and I decided to wait till some of them returned with more material. They were away perhaps an hour and came back with samples which were not all astringent in taste, and it was clear that the bed was less than a foot thick and definitely not coal. Analyses of this Ansarit carbonaceous material and of the fault shale show they are high in volatile matter and may be related to coal or lignite more closely than to oil. On the way back I was struck by the general resemblance of the country to that of the Hanun-Thenut-Ha’rat region, and I think they have the same strata. The limestones on this side frequently show low seaward dips (as between Murbat and Takah, near the Rizat spring, near the outfall of the Arbat, and other places). This had been noted by H. J. Carter also. 55. On the 15th February I re-visited the Garzaz spring with Mr. Pradhan Singh, and then after collecting data on the capacity of the aerodrome camp tube-well we went on to the pool in the Sahnut (Sahalnaut) wadi. The measurement at the Garzaz confirmed my previous figure of 1-25 cusecs, while the Sahnut channel was found to be carrying about 3 cusecs, and could probably secure more if precautions were taken against leakage from the pool. However, there is a great loss from the channel, since at a distance of 4 miles out from the pool the volume of water was barely i a cusec. On the way back we had time to examine the lake at El Balad, and I was certainly surprised to find the water fresh, and to see it at about the same level as the sea (across a strip of sand), and to hear that its level rises and falls with the tide though not as much. The Sultan, whom I saw that evening, told me that many of the wells (used for irrigating the cocoanut groves along the coast) are also influenced by the tide and yet hold fresh water. These wells are from 12 to 18 feet deep and the water level in them should be slightly above sea-level. Next day, the 16th February, I examined more specimens that had been brought in and I packed up all those I decided to have further examined or analyzed, then in the evening I went to the Palace to explain matters to His Highness as I was to leave by the plane next morning. The Sultan understood everything and was most considerate. 56. I left Salalah on the 17th February by the British Overseas Airways Corporation’s Speedboat (Dakota plane, Captain A. Spooner) at about 8 a.m. for Masira island and Karachi. This company is closing down its traffic along the south Arabian coast and with drawing from Ryan (near Makalla), Salalah and Masira, and this wasf the last but one journey (taking away gear and staff) The course was in a north-easterly direction so that we flew a little north of Darbat lake and the Jabal Samhan over the barren country near the headwaters of the Andhaur wadi system (where the hills are flat- topped and strata evidently almost horizontal). At Masira island I procured a few pieces of the dark limestone (Eocene) and basic igneous rock (Semail Igneous series of upper Jurassic, Portlandian, to lower Cretaceous, Neocomian, age). From Masira we flew to near Ras Jiwani (near Gwadur West bay) where middle Tertiary (Miocene: middle, Tortonian to Helvetian) strata, the Ears series, occur and continue eastwards into Gwadur. We turned east, out to sea south of Gwadur, for Karachi, and I was able to check my previous observations (paragraph 30). Next day, the 18th February, I continued my journey, from Karachi to New Delhi, by a B.O.A.C. connection, on an Indian National Airways York plane. The course lay north-east so as to cross the Indus a little north of Hyderabad (Sind) and I was able to see the monoclinal folds, facing east, as we crossed the area of Bhula Khan (Thana), east of the Kirthar range, over lower Eocene (Eaki) and some upper Eocene (Kirthar) formations. My general impression from these observations and those along the Arabian coast and my knowledge of the geology of the coast of western India, south of the Great Rann of Cutch and Kathiawar and Guzerat, is that, structurally, the ranges of Sind and Baluchistan belong to the Persian and Oman system. 30♦ 31 IV. GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS Structural Geology 57. In his valuable paper, ‘The Geology and Tectonics of Oman and Parts of South-Eastern Arabia’, Dr. G. M. Lees has briefly discussed the controversial aspects of the views of Krenkel and Kober, and he considers that their ‘. explanations contain an element of truth, and that the true solution is more complex than either’. Broadly speaking and geologically, Oman, in my opinion, belongs, structurally, to Asia, while south-western Arabia is similarly a part of Africa (the separation from Somaliland, by the foundering of the land and the formation of the Gulf of Aden, is of comparatively recent date (Pliocene, perhaps), whereas the uplift of the Zagros and Oman mountains is slightly older (upper Miocene ?)). It would appear to me, also, that the faulting which is almost certainly present along the southern coast of Arabia continues into the Great Rann of Cutch and so has sliced or cut off any southward con tinuation of orographic axial lines southwards from the ranges of Sind (if these ever existed). However, these points are mentioned in passing as they cannot be properly established without detailed geological mapping (surveys) and this has still to be done. Dr. Lees map shows how disconnected have been the investigations in south eastern Arabia, and once greater fossil evidence is available for establishing a reliable basis for correlation his list of geological formations will reduce to half the number, as there are two or three formations of similar age. • j • i c 58. In this connection the paper by Dr. L. Picard is also ol considerable interest (see 1937, On the Structure of the Arabian Peninsula’). He speaks of the Oman mountains, including the Western Ha jar, as follows: ‘This mountain arc is a foreign element on Arabian soil... The Oman range . . . betrays a pushing move ment towards Arabia and belongs to the Iranian North Syrian Alpine structure of folding ... one can assume from the descriptions of Lees... that here also, i.e. in the West of Oman, there exists a foreland of folds which pushes towards the depression o Rub-al-Khali On the other hand these normal foldings follow the bend of the Oman nappes. South of Muscat near Sur one meets with a district of “regular folds” (Lees) which abut on to the Indian Ocean ’ ‘The latest voyages of discovery of Thomas and Philby further show that the subsoil of the actual Rub-al-Khali is composed of Tertiary sediments quite analogous to those ot the32 Mesopotamian depression . .. (Eocene, Ears series . . . salt ur- rences). The “empty quarter” is . . . the continuation of the Meso potamian geosynclinal trough which here suggests a folded structure in the subsoil concealed by the mighty dunes ; this conception there fore accords well with the folded structure of Qatar and ie airein islands... It may be assumed that these Rub-al-Khah folds diminish . . . towards the South Arabian border land of Hadramaut. 59 In the case of Dhufar, whether it belongs to Picard s ‘arabo-somali table’ or is part of the ‘foreland’ south-west of the Oman arc of folded strata, it is only possible at present to say that ancient (pre-Cambrian and Archaean) rocks show up around the coast between Ras Nus and Murbat as a worn-down plain which appears to tilt towards the scarp of the Jabal Samhan. In the strip between the Archaean plain of Murbat and the edge of the Samhan plateau sedimentary rocks, evidently unaltered by meta morphism, are present. Their age is not known, but they are suspected to be upper Palaeozoic (Carboniferous to Permian) to perhaps Mesozoic (Trias to Jurassic) and possibly the equivalents of Tees’ Hatat Phyllites. They are overlaid by brownish limestones with middle Cretaceous marine fossils, but this is at the western edge of the sedimentary strip. In the scarp itself the equivalents of the Hatat Phyllites (Tees’ Murbat Sandstone) are overlaid, with a slight discordance of bedding, by unfossiliferous limestones which are, on the evidence of the Cretaceous fossils already mentioned, believed to represent upper Cretaceous to Eocene marine deposits. I was not able to discover any zones of shearing north of Murbat, but the Murbat sandstones dip very steeply away from the pre- Cambrian rocks of Jabal Ali (north of Murbat) and at the eastern end of the bay immediately north of the Jabal Ali. 60. Elsewhere in Dhufar, except up the wadi Nagar Ghaiz, 9 miles west-north-west of Risut, Eocene limestones are present, with a covering of Pleistocene to Pliocene Miliolite limestone along the coastal belt of the Jurbaid or Dhufar plain. These Eocene limestones appear to have a gentle overall inclination to the south west and also to be arched in the Qara mountains (Jabal Qara). Facing the plains and at either end, Takah and Risut, there is a seaward dip, well seen at several places between Murbat and Takah, and again at the debouches of the wadi Rizat and of the Arbat, etc. Within the Jabal Qara the dips suggest very gentle folding parallel with the watershed, but these details are visible in several places and have not been properly sifted. On the northern side of the watershed, A1 Qutun, in the area of Qarn Shaiba the limestones appear to dip gently northwards. There is thus evidence of a large, flat and extensive arch (anticlinal) along the trend of the Qara mountains, roughly east-north-east to north-east. This is in general agreement with Picard’s ‘arabo-somali’ zone, and thus the question♦ of an oil-field must naturally arise, seeing that the Eocene strata of Bahrein which are more or less on the same structural lines have become an important source of oil. However, this question will be dealt with in Section V, Economic Minerals. Stratigraphical Factors 61. In the list of formations on the geological map accompanying Dr. Fees’ paper on ‘The Geology and Tectonics of Oman and of Parts of South-Eastern Arabia’ no less than 15 items are given, ranging in age from the Murbat Crystallines of Archaean age to recent deposits such as raised beaches. In the Dhufar area, however, he recognizes only five formations: (1) the basal crystalline rock of Murbat; (2) the Murbat sandstones next above; (3) a middle to upper Cretaceous limestone which is shown right across the Jabal Samhan, the Jabal Qara and the Jabal Qamer; (4) Eocene limestones which are shown as flanking the Cenomanian to Senonian limestones above mentioned, but undifferentiated themselves; and (5) recent formations largely in the coastal plain of Dhufar. 62. The stratigraphy of the Oman mountains region shows the following formations according to Dr. Fees:— Taking the strata from the top (newest formation). 12. Allpvium including the Miliolitic limestone. 11. Miocene (coal-bearing beds) of Sur syncline. 10. Eocene limestones from Dhufar to the gulf of Masira and along the coast between Muscat and Ras al Hadd. , . 9. Upper Cretaceous (Maestrichtian) beds of Jabal Abyadh. 8. Fower Cretaceous to Upper Jurassic (? Neocomian) Hawasina series around Jabal Akhdar. 7. Fower Cretaceous to Upper Jurassic, Semail Igneous series of the Western Hajar and Masira island. 6. Upper Jurassic (Portlandian) Musandam limestones. 5. Upper Triassic (Noric) Elphinstone beds. 4. Permian (?) below Jabal Akhdar. . . 3. Permian to Fower Carboniferous (Uralian. Saxonian) of Saih Hatat and including the Hatat Phyllites. _ 2. Cambrian of Qishm and other islands in the Persian Gulf. . . r 1. Pre-Cambrian or crystalline rocks showing as an mlier near Kalhat. 63. To the south-west of Dhufar in the Sultanate of Makalla, Mr. O. H. Fittle recognized the following stratigraphical units. Recent and Pleistocene including wind-borne sand, alluvial deposits and raised beaches ;34 in Pliocene conglomerates which overlie Oligocene Eocene, Cretaceous and Jurassic beds unconformably and may in some cases include Miocene strata and also perhaps sub- recent deposits; ^ ^. i . Miocene and Oligocene of Meifa, Neifa, Gizwal, Kanina, etc. , Eocene (Lutetian) or middle Eocene limestone which caps the more conspicuous cliffs in the hinterland of Makalla and generally overlies Cretaceous beds , ^ Cretaceous sandstone series (? Neocomian) of Asfal el’Ain, Kasai and ’Arnuf el Oik, which include the lignite occurrences of Makalla and resemble the so-called Nubian sandstones ’; . TTT ,. . Jurassic (Corallian?) of Neifa, Hisn Baqirdan, Wadi Arus, etc. and includes the carbonaceous limestones and the oil shale horizon of Makalla; and Crystalline (Metamorphic) rocks of Wadi el’Arit consist of an igneous complex and exposed as a peneplain, and evidently include granite (near el Reish) at the base of Hisn Baqirdan and felsite porphyry at el Humar. Ras Makalla consists of dolerite and basalt into which veins of fine granite have been intruded. The exposures between Huta and Fakhida consist of mica-schist, talc- schist and chlorite-schist. These contain a little hema tite, pyrite and malachite in association with veins of pegmatite and calcite. 64. In view of the rock formations of the Oman mountains about Muscat and the Hadhramaut in Makalla, it is of some impor tance to notice carefully what representatives of these occur in the intermediate area of Hhufar. The basal crystalline rocks occur in the peneplain of Murbat and these are the oldest rocks known in south-eastern Arabia. The next oldest rocks are believed to be brownish sandstones and greenish to buff-coloured shales which Dr. Lees has termed the Murbat sandstones and hinted at as Mesozoic in age (Trias to Cretaceous), and therefore the probable equivalents of the Hawasina series or the middle-upper (Corallian) beds of Hisn Baqirdan (Makalla). The nearest equivalent of the upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian) from near Murbat and the Samhan hills are the Maestrichtian beds at Jabal Abyadh on the one hand (Muscat region) and Little’s lignite-bearing sandstones (lower Cretaceous: ? Portlandian) on the other (Makalla side). Neither can be correlated with the Dhufar upper Cretaceous. No lower Eocene (Laki: Ypresian to Landenian? or Ranikot: Landenian to Montian ?) have been found either in the Muscat (Oman) area (except perhaps some massive limestone overlying the upper Cretaceous near Kalhat) or in Makalla (Hadhramaut) region, so far as I know. The35 Eocene fossils collected by Bertram Thomas from the^ southern side of the Rub’al Khali were identified (by L. R. Cox) as ‘all from a white limestone of Middle Eocene age’. As already shown (para graph 63) the Eocene is represented in Makalla by middle Eocene limestones. The Eocene of Masira island and again at Sireir (on the mainland opposite the island of Hamar an Nafur) on the gulf of Masira, on the fossil evidence, is middle Eocene. And Eees states fuage 610 of his paper) : ‘At Dhofar the Cretaceous limestone is over laid by Eocene limestone with small Nummulites and Alveolina. At Thaqa and Ras Risut chalky limestones crop out, containing abundant large Orbitoides, sensu lato. They have not yet been examined to determine whether they are Lepidocychna or Urmo- ^ 65. There has been some confusion about the Cretaceous (Cenomanian) limestone and the Eocene limestone. There is no village called Dhufar or Dhofar, so that the extract quoted m the previous paragraph is incomplete. And another extract . The presence of Cenomanian in Dhofar was proved by Carter, whose fossil collection included Pecten (Vola)^ quadncostata, Saienia scutigera, Orbitolina concava, and other typical Cenomanian species. The limestones rest directly, with a slight angular disconformity, on the Murbat Sandstone. The fossils occur m some marly deposits at the base of the 1400-foot limestone group which forms the summit of Jabal Samhan. The upper beds are of Eocene a g e jSo probablv the various stages of upper Cretaceous are also represented, but are unfossiliferous.’ Dr. Lees does not claim to have found anv fossils himself, and I did not find any fossils at all m the overlving limestones, particularly at their base In his section (Fig/5 page 622) Dr. Lees ‘. . . shows the ancient crystalline rocks overlaid by the desert sandstone formation and the Cenomanian- Eocene limestone series forming the scarp of Jabal Samhan ^ nne of the fossils described in Dr. Lees paper came from ^hufar produce and I am therefore assuming that he has depended on the collect o made by H. J. Carter. I have therefore r ^ e ^ me ^^ r in the tributions (particularly his revised paper of 185 ^ P-oc 1 ^ 597 a nd ‘Geological Papers on Western India , 1857, pages 585 to 597, including the section and the sketch from Marbat) 66 Mr H. T. Carter reckoned the scarp section at 3,400 e (plus another 400 feet to the limestone of the summit northward on the Samhan hill plateau). He recognized : i 4 . 0 O feet White limestone strata. . •• ' ' ’qoo Argillaceous strata of a red colour / ' Coarse micaceous sandstone, of a yellow brownish colour, finer higher up •• •• B/uu „ Beginning from the bottom, the sandstones become finer as we36 c ascend and finely laminated, also more yellow above and chocolate brown at the top. This sandstone passes into an argillaceous division of various colours, chiefly red, one stratum of a soapy nature was excavated and used as edible clay by women. The red strata pass into white and grey, compact limestone of a lithographic t v pe, and above this comes a whitish, chalky deposit, more or less argillaceous (from which the Bedouins cut their stone pipes). Then comes again a white compact limestone. No further details of the section are given until the soil on the summit of the table-land is stated to be of a brick-red colour. Then the following list of fossils is given as coming from the summit of the formation inland down wards to an unknown extent:— Alveolina sphaeroidea, HJ.C.; Alveolina Melo, D’Orbig.; Operculina, D’Orbig. species, white limestone; Cyclolina arabica, from the white limestone strata of the summit; Corbis? species, resembling Corbis pectunculus, Lamarck; Inoceramus ? species ; Nerita, species ?; Cari- naria ? species ?; Trochus, species ? ; and Buccinum, spe cies ? Mr. Carter says (page 589), ‘ From the coloured argil laceous strata I obtained nothing but a rock specimen of limestone of a lead-blue colour, almost entirely composed of a small piece of Orbitolina, D’Orbigny, . . . but I did not preserve it, not knowing at the time from what part of the series it came.’ He added, ‘Nor did I see any thing in the micaceous sandstone worth noting . . . ’ 67. On page 590, Mr. Carter continued as follows: ‘Having, then, seen the igneous tract at Marbat, and traced the strata of the table-land to its summit, let us return ... to the granite plain . . . ’ He then describes the Miliolite formation and (page 591) proceeds along the coast to the base of the great slope of the table-land. Here 4 fniles west of Murbat he examined a sea-cliff and found the section (from the top):— Calcareous sandy deposits, like the miliolite mentioned, in which are embedded rounded pebbles of the older lime stone 5 feet. Compact, coarse, shelly, impure limestone, of a light whitish colour. Dark brown limestone, of the kind stated to exist behind the granite hills at Marbat. Compact white limestone, breaking with conchoidal fracture and even surface. And then after tracing this cliff section for 12 miles to near Takah, Carter gives the following section (page 595):— Great scarp of White limestone strata above, containing the coast. Cyclolina at the summit, which, accord- I 68 . the Dhi as he ca we hav&lt; promon brown 1 Nothing compac brown 1 white 1 quoted lation a and no paper matter' upper ] plain, 1 found these a: by strz Eocene other f&lt; 69 limestc I brou Qara, : incline petrolc Muker; identif37 colate iceous soapy le red raphic )r less Then of the and is fossils down- )rbig.; clolina of the tculus, Cari- , i, spe- l argil- nen of iposed I did it part e any- 9 aving, of the n . .

Mr. Carter’s description continues from Takah and across the Dhufar plain, with the ruins of El Balad, to Risut or Ras Resut as he calls it (page 596) and on the next page he states, ‘. . . Here then, we have compact white limestone raised up to form the ridge of the promontory, while the Nummulitic Series is thinned out to the dark brown limestone only, which remains in a horizontal line at its base. Nothing, therefore, now can be more plain than that this white compact limestone, which we have seen all along underlying the dark brown limestone, is a part of the cretaceous series, or that of the great white limestone series of the table-land . . . ’ From what has been quoted it is clear that the only fossils that can be used for the corre lation with the Cretaceous are those I have given in paragraph 66 and not as indicated in paragraph 65, unless there is some other paper by Mr. Carter which refers to a subsequent visit. So, as matters stand, the whole of the 1,400 feet of limestones seen in the upper part of the scarp of Jabal Samhan, facing the Murbat pene plain, belongs to one series. This series is determined by the fossils found in the upper part of the limestones (summit of scarp). If these are Cretaceous (Cenomanian) forms, the Samhan hills are capped by strata of that age. If on the other hand the fossil evidence is Eocene, then there are no Cretaceous rocks in Dhufar, as there is no other fossil evidence from this province other than what I have given. 69. As already stated I found no fossils in the lower part of the limestone scarp of Jabal Samhan, facing Murbat. The few fossils I brought back from the Qarn Shaiba, to the north of the Jabal Qara, from about Hanun and somewhat higher beds (which I was inclined to correlate with those west-north-west of Risut on a petrological similarity only), have been examined by Mr. P. N. Mukerjee, M.Sc., Geological Survey of India, and he has kindly identified them as follows:— (1) Miliolite limestone from near Salalah contains Miliola and numerous fragments of Pcctcfi, Cofius, etc., also Macrocallista ci. agrestis (Cotter) and Cardium sub- fragile (Bottger), both characteristic of the uppermost Eocene (Yaw stage) of Burma ;38 (2) and (3) Echinoids from about half-way down the sides of Hanun wadi, and recognized as belonging to the genus Echinolampas , similar to specimens from the Kirthar of Kathiawar, Cutch and Sind—middle to upper Lutetian (middle Eocene) ; _ ^ (4) Ostrea, closely related to 0. turkestanensis of E. R. Cox, middle Eocene of Persia and Arabia, collected at the same horizon and place as (2) and (3) above, (5) (61 and (7) contain Scutellaria ci. nummulana recorded by Cossman and Pissaro from the Lutetian (middle-lower Eocene) of the Paris Basin. These specimens come from the Hanun wadi and about the same horizon as (2) to (4) above ; ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) contain specimens of Lucina, Diplodonta and Natica. The Lucina is closely related to, if not identical with L. vawensis of Cotter from the uppermost Eocene (Yaw stage) of Burma. Both lots of specimens come from a similar horizon and well above that of the Hanun wadi ((2) to (7) ). Some of the specimens are from the limestones between Kazmeem, but nearer Ayun, and the others are from the cliffs above Obet (Lay ’ath) on the way up to Nissa (Na Sat), roughly 70. It may appear from the previous paragraphs of this section that I have laboured the subject of correlation, but this has been necessary from the economic point of view (of the prospects for oil and coal) since the stratigraphical data are so uncertain. However, from the information in my possession the following succession of the rocks of the Dhufar province in the Sultanate of Oman may be tentatively recognized:— 12. Recent alluvium, Sand dunes and Tufa deposits. 11. River terraces and conglomerates of W. Ghaiz. 10. Miliolitic limestone of Dhufar coast (Murbat to Risut). 9. Qara (A1 Qutun) limestones (between Na Sat and Obet). 8 . Qam Shaiba limestones (Hanun, Thenut, Ha’rat). 7. Risut limestones (up the wadi Nagar Ghaiz). 6 . Samhan hills limestone (with that east of Takah). 5. Argillaceous beds (300 feet) Jabal Samhan scarp. 4. Micaceous sandstones (1,700 feet). 3. Murbat bay sandstones north of Murbat. 2. Jabal Ali metamorphic rocks (Murbat). 1 . Crystalline gneisses of Murbat peneplain. These successive formations are dealt with in the following paragraphs from the oldest ( 1 ) to the youngest ( 12 ).Archaean of Murbat 71. There are two different groups of Archaean or pre-Cambrian rocks at Murbat. The older, in my opinion, are: (1) the crystalline gneisses seen on the peneplain of Murbat and well exposed along the south coast and near the emergency landing ground. These rocks trend almost north-south with high westerly _ foliation dips, and comprise gneisses and schists of a banded series. The chief bands are micaceous schists with quartz granulite bands, but there are pink to red pegmatitic granites associated, probably as intru- sives (and so perhaps somewhat younger), but no basic igneous rocks were noted in this area. The next series are (2) seen immediately north of Murbat in the low hills, Jabal Ali, between the town and the base of the Jabal Samhan scarp at the eastern end of Murbat bay. These are definitely a metamorphic complex and include dolomitic marbles, amphibolite and serpentine, tremolite of a fibrous type, talc or soapstone, and appear to include sills of granite (pegmatite). These rocks have a strike trending in a general north east to south-west direction with north-westerly dips (of the foliation planes, but these are irregular and often twisted). The nearest equivalent to these rocks appears to be in the Kuria Muria islands north-east to east-north-east from Ras Nus (the far side of the pene plain from Murbat) and within 70 miles of it. The distances to the various islands from the ruins at Hasik (10 miles north of Ras Nus), east-north-eastwards, are 20 miles to Hasikiya, 36 miles to Suda, 44 miles to Hallaniya, 52 miles to Gharzaut (Rodondo rock, 6 miles north of Hallaniya) and 64 miles to Jibliyah. Samhan Hiee Series 72 Under this title are included (3) the Murbat bay sand- QtnnPQ nn the shore of Murbat bay and immediately alongside close association with ( 2 ) and appear faulted against 39I 40 4 c these metamorphic rocks. There is thus a possibility that the rocks with gypsum veins and bituminous matter in the wadi Ghaiz may be the equivalent of these (3) beds, and that both may be the same as the Micaceous sandstones (4) of the Jabal Samhan scarp base. It is possible also that these beds (3), as above considered, might be the equivalent of Littles Hisn Baqirdan (Corallian) in Makalla (and grouped with (4) ). With regard to (5), which appear to be quite conformably laid on (4), there is the possibility that these strata are the equivalents of Little’s Asfal el’Ain (Neocomian) of Makalla and/or Lees’ Cenomanian marls at Sireir (opposite Hamar an Nafur island) on the mainland of the gulf of Masira. 73. The most complex question has been the geological age of ( 6 ) the Samhan Hills limestone (see paragraphs 65, 66 , 67, 68 and 69). I found no fossils in the basal beds of these limestones, but I noted that they sloped south-westward to be in situ along the sea- cliff mentioned by H. J. Carter (near the island rock of Guena). If the fossils collected by Mr. Carter on the summit of Jabal Samhan are considered as Cretaceous, there is nothing more to say than that they are the only limestones of this kind in southern or south-eastern Arabia. They do not correspond with the Cretaceous (sandstones) of Makalla, nor are they the petrological equivalents of those beds referred to by Dr. Lees at Sireir (on the gulf of Masira). Lees shows the Samhan Hills limestone to be as old as Cenomanian (page 606 of his paper) and the Sireir beds to be Campanian (though he puts both under the same colour on his geological map). The matter is of considerable interest, and until a detailed investigation is carried out I propose to regard the Jabal Samhan limestones as lower Lutetian and possibly of Laki, but probably of lower Kirthar age, with the equivalent of the Ranikot (Landenian to Montian) missing. Qara Mountain Limestones 74. So far as the rocks from Takah to Risut are concerned there is great uncertainty since the plains of Dhufar are, along the coast, covered by the Miliolitic limestone and around the edge of the plains, along the foothills, the strata appear to be considerably higher in the sequence than the basal limestone of the Jabal Samhan ( 6 ). We have no fossils from Risut and the limestones there (7) are, for the present, correlated with ( 8 ) the Qarn Shaiba limestones, which from good fossil evidence are fixed as middle Eocene or Kirthar (middle Lutetian). It is in these strata that ‘chalky limestone’ is noticeable almost everywhere, and, in the Hanun wadi the beds are, in certain layers, saline and the ‘dead’ white beds, near the top of the section, are pure dolomite. The next younger subdivision of these extensive limestones of Dhufar are those of the cliffs above Obet and the wadi at Heelah.

These limestones mdy not be the highest beds on the Qutun or watershed of the Jabal Qara, but are referred to as the Qara (A1 Qutun) limestones (9), because I think they will be found in all the upper valleys if not forming the actual open upland, karstland, of the Jabal Qara. Included among the fossils of these beds are certain forms indicating the uppermost Eocene (Yaw stage) of Burma (see paragraph 69). Miuoutic Coastal Limestones 75. ' These porous, shelly limestones are seen all along the coast from Murbat to near Risut, usually within a distance of about 2 to 2 | miles from the beach. They are very similar to the Porbandar limestone of Kathiawar and other coastal Miliolitic limestones at the head of the Arabian Sea from Sind to Dhufar. The occurrences near Okad (Augad), Salalah, Hafa and so on eastwards to Takah and to Murbat are in bedded deposits 8 to 20 feet thick with the separate layers each from 12 to 18 inches thick. The dips at Salalah are south at about 5 degrees, and the rock is sufficiently consolidated (cemented with carbonate of lime) to be hard enough for a somewhat friable freestone for building purposes. It is difficult to decide the age of the beds and their origin, but studies elsewhere (Kathiawar) by J. W. Evans (1900) resulted in most of these Miliolitic limestones being regarded as ‘ wind-borne ’ (aeolian), littoral deposits of relatively recent age. The material is chiefly the cases of small foraminifera and fragments of shells and corals. In the case of the Miliolite limestone from near Salalah (see paragraph 69) many of the fossils appear to be uppermost Eocene forms (Yaw stage), but as the aggre gate is almost entirely detrital material it must be assumed that the foraminifera and other fossil fragments represent material derived from the rocks exposed within the drainage of the Dhufar coast. As the oldest fossil remains are not older than uppermost Eocene it may be concluded that such rocks exist or existed, in this area and suffered or are suffering erosion. In my. opinion the Miliolite is probably not newer than Pleistocene and might be as old as Pliocene and the uppermost Eocene has been removed and some what older rocks, upper to middle Eocene, are now present m the existing drainage area of the Dhufar plains. W. Ghaiz Conglomerate and Dahaq Tufa 76. The conglomerate terrace now subject to erosion by the Nagar Ghaiz wadi is upwards of 30 feet thick and is regarded as no younger than Pleistocene. The pebbles and boulders are large y o limestone, with some sandstones, and cemented with tulaceous (calcareous) precipitates. The evidence of this erosion suggests42 that there has been an uplift of the Arabian coast near Risut (and presumably westwards into the Jabal Qamar of the Hac iramaut). The wadi down the scarp of the Jabal Samhan into Murbat bay also shows evidence of erosion, but it js not as mar ed as that in the Ghaiz wadi. All the wadis draining north trom A 1 Qutun into the Qarn Shaiba and towards the Nejd show strong signs of erosion, so that the general evidence is towards uplift throughout Dhufar. There are terraces of tufa-conglomerate at the debouche of many of the wadis emptying into the Dhufar plain. Among the most conspicuous of such deposits of calcareous tufa or travertine is that in Darbat wadi, at the ‘ abyss of the Bents (Bertram Thomas precipice), known as the Dahaq. It has been deposited from water which has cascaded over an obstacle and become aerated and precipitated calcium carbonate. In this way a lake was impounded and the overflow continued to build up the dam (as is the case at Band-i-Amir in the Hindukush in Afghanistan today). After a time the lake spilled through the lateral valley to the west until another natural dam was built up there, and then both dams were built up and the lake bed itself also largely filled up with tufa. The lake of Darbat is a remnant of what it was, and the Dahaq must be between 500 and 600 feet high where seen as a wall (up valley as you come from Takah). the relativ plains in 1 Dhufar pi zone of we geodes, the of fibrous £ and their a mountains Weathering and Erosion Effects 77 . Except for the evidence of the springs—Garzaz, Sahnut, Rizat, etc.—and the curious hole (Dianae Oraculum?) in the wadi Nihaz, there are no great underground caves in the limestones of Jabal Qara, other than that of Sahaur above the Ghaur Fazl (Dianae Oraculum). Caves occur all around in these hills, but they are . erosion rather than solution effects on certain beds of limestone (as is well seen at almost every water-hole (pool) in the Qarn Shaiba country). And yet on the upland of A1 Qutun (between Na Sat and the descent to the Rizat spring via Othik, for example) the ‘trip pillars’ of limestone show that solution is operating effectively. In the upper valley of the Darbat among the western slopes of Jabal Samhan there is said to be a great ‘sink-hole’, and it is shown on some Air Flight maps. However, more active in this respect is the weathering in progress in Dhufar. In the region to the north chemical action appears to work hand in hand with hot sun and occasional heavy rain, and it was my impression that the ‘ chalky ’ dolomite beds of the Qarn Shaiba area were chemically produced in non-dolomitic limestones in situ. I had the impression also that some of the flint and chert had been segregated in those limestones after the beds had been laid down as sediments in a tropical sea, and that this silica- freeing action was of comparatively recent date.

In dealing with the mineral resources of Dhufar it is necessary to remember that practically the entire province is on Eocene (Lower Tertiary) limestones and that very small areas include older rocks—Sandstones and Shales which ma^ contain coal or petroleum, and that such ancient rocks as metamorphic and Archaean formations, which usually contain metalliferous deposits, occupy only 60 to 100 square miles in Dhufar (Murbat peneplain), Furthermore, from the specimens which were collected to show me it is seen that material came largely from the Archaean rocks, of the Murbat area, and a little from the Ghaiz wadi inlier of phyllites (of supposed Mesozoic age). However, there have been no industries in Dhufar nor any evidence of a mineral industry in this province at any time in its' long history, except the quarrying of ‘freestone’ for building purposes, the manufacture of stone pipes (for smoking tobacco), the production of earthenware (pottery) and the occasion^ use of edible clay. The practice of eating clay is far wider than is normally appreciated even by geologists and medical men, indeed, it is correct to say that 9 out of 10, so-called ‘salt licks’ frequented by animals, are clay-licks. The list of minerals to be considered is as follows:— (1) Alum shale; (2) Aluminium ore or Bauxite; (3) Building stone; (4) Coal and Lignite; (5) Copper ore; ( 6 ) Dolo mite ; (7) Edible clay; ( 8 ) Flint and chert; (9) Gypsum and Anhydrite; (10) Hematite (Iron ore); (11) Lead ore (Galena); (12) Limestone; (13) Oil (Petroleum); (14) Pottery clays; (15) Road ‘metal’; (16) Salt; (17) Serpentine; (18) Talc (Soapstone); (19) Tremo- lite; and (20) Water-supplies. Alum Shale 79. A sample of carbonaceous material from the Ansarit side of the gap at the head of the Nagar Ghaiz wadi, 9 to 12 miles, west- north-west of Risut, with a strong astringent taste (of Alum) was analyzed and showed only 2-84% of water-soluble components, but these included 1-21% calcium sulphate, 0-90% magnesium sulphate, 0-02% ferrous sulphate, 0-13% aluminium sulphate, 0*28% sodium sulphate and 0-30% sodium chloride. The carbonaceous matter in the specimens represent 14-66% of the whole and yield 9'06 0 / 0 volatile matter (including a small proportion of moisture) and 5-60 0 / 0 fixed carbc shale (or I Altho noted tha alumina : (Sultanate sample ga the perce aluminiur to becomi date whe thorough! covered c The that the &lt; taken av there are Further i Eocene 1 quarry a material, where tl chemical accessibl and the think, be calcareo be a def&lt; are no b The Sen and of D represer very ser adequat this pro 80. head of coal or certain! greaterar it is :e is on 11 areas tain coal hie and deposits, replain). )w me it s of the Hites (of idustries orovince eestone’ smoking casional than is ideed, it quented dered is Building 3) Dolo- Gypsum 1 ) head roleum); 5) Salt; Tremo- arit side es, west- nm) was mts, but ;ulphate, , sodium ratter in 1 9-06°/o d 5-60°/o m fixed carbon (in total percentages). It is thus a carbonaceous or coal shale (or possibly an oil shale). t Aluminium Ore or Bauxite Although no bauxite has been located in Dhufar, it is to be ted that Mr. Little has recorded a bauxitic shale (with 46% alumina in the Cretaceous (Neocomian) beds of ’Arnuf el Dik Sultanate of Makalla), and that another sample of a white powdery Mmole gave as much as 67% of alumina. No statement is given of ffie nercentage of silica in this material (an important factor in dnminium ores) but the alumina is sufficiently high for the material m become of economic interest. It is possible that at some future date when the Argillaceous series in the Samhan hills scarp are thoroughly examined, some similar, high alumina clay may be dis covered close under the white, lithographic limestones. Buieding Stone The Miliolitic limestones are already well known, so much so that the dressed blocks and pillars from El Balad and other rums are to away for new buildings and quarrying avoided. However there are large quantities of this' freestone ’ available along the coast. Further inland, among the Qara mountains, there is superior stone. Eocene limestones, but they will be harder and more costly quarry as dressed blocks. 'Their greatest usefulness, as a buddmg material will be for lime-burning and cement manufacture (an 'L pu.it, .• W) tl&gt;=, '‘‘S iS chemical purposes, as will be explained). There are no easily accessible sandstones which might be used in place of the uuliohte, and the subject of sand for mortars and plasters and concrete wdl, I think be concentrated on the sea-shore sands which must be both calcareous and salt-impregnated.

The texture is fine and for this reason I have not termed it a car bonaceous or bituminous sandstone. In this connection I must say that His Highness showed me a specimen of sandstone with car bonaceous laminae attached, and stated that it came from the Samhan hills. I procured no further specimen when at Murbat, and feel certain that the Sultan’s information is quite accurate for the following reasons. In the Geological Survey of India office there is an entry on a File (528), under Reg. No. 1818/5-12-1907, of 'Car bonaceous Shale—Samhal Hills Coal? Arabia’ with the analysis below: Moisture 2-40%, Volatile Matter 6-60%, Fixed Carbon 3*6%, Ash 87-30%, and a Specific Gravity of 2-38. The car bonaceous components agree very well with the specimen from Ansarit and so does the percentage of Ash. The material may be of a lignitic character, but is not of any economic value. The poorest material of lignite from Makalla, that from Baqrein, shows 5-4% Moisture, 16-6% Volatile Matter, 10-9% Fixed Carbon and 67% Ash, while the good quality lignite, from Asfal el’Ain, gave, on analysis, 10-0% Moisture, 40-2% Volatile Matter, 38-5% Fixed Carbon, 11-3% Ash and a Calorific Value of 6,370 calories (11,466 B.T.U.’s). In regard to the possibilities of finding lignitic coal in Dhufar, all that can be said at present is that the position of the anticipated seams may best be sought at the base of the Samhan hills limestone or in the highest beds of the underlying Argillaceous series. Before closing this subject of coal it may be remembered that two officers of the Geological Survey of India visited an area south of Sur and about 30 miles west-south-west of Ras al Hadd in 1900-01. Both A. F. von Krafft and R. D. Oldham brought back large samples from the area between Musweh and Migel, in the Fisao valley, and where outcrops are as much as 4 f feet thick. The strata occur m a synclinal 10 miles axially and 4 miles across, trending roughly east-west. These samples yielded the following Moisture Volatile Matter Fixed Carbon Ash Specific Gravity Caking Property Von Krafft’s 4-66% 5-61% 30-29% 64-04% 1 - 01 % 1-318 29-88°/ 62-78°/ 1-71°/ 1-34 Oldham’s 5-81% 13-77% 28-27% 59-70% 6 - 22 % 1-31 29-03% 52-33% 4*87% 1-36 f All are non-caking but one speci- . . j men low in moisture was of caking ( character. * The less than to be of stones at matter t&lt; coals of .

The strata are said t0 be of Miocene age at the top of a 6,000-foot series of lime- stones at the base of which Nummulites occur. The ratio of volatile matter to fixed carbon is suggestive of the Gondwana (Permian) coals of India, and I should doubt the Miocene age of these seams. However, Oldham is supposed to have found the seams irregular and thought the distance to Khor Jerama (near Ras al Hadd) too far and difficult at that time for the development of the Sur or Fisao. valley coalfield. Nearly 50 years have passed since his visit and it might be worth re-examination now. The high grade of the samples, both Oldham’s and von Krafft’s, is evident and the calorific value is exceptionally high. Copper Ore 81. I saw no sample of copper ore from any locality in Dhufar nrovince but mention must be made of the copper ore occurrences, mcluding old workings, in Masira island. These deposits were drawn attention to by H. J. Carter a century ago. The material met with was the ‘blue’ and ‘green’ carbonate of copper, which occurs in decomposed hornblendic rock (presumably of the Setnail Igneous series) No sulphide 6 re was encountered, so that the mining opera- tions may have been conducted only with a view to obtaining easily smelted o're without much trouble. As the deposits have been lying idle for 100 years it is possible they may have been forgotten. They cannot be considered as useless until the sulphide ore beneath been tested and found unsatisfactory. Doeomite Two samples of ‘chalky ’ limestone which I collected from be&lt;k, q and 20 feet thick respectively, and lying practically horizontal, in raline exposures south-west of Hanun, have yielded the following results: - 3 -foot bed. 53-66% Calcium carbonate .. Calcium sulphate Magnesium carbonate Insolubles, Silica, etc. Oxide of iron Alumina .. Alkalies, etc. 0 - 02 % 45-14% 0-34% 0-26% 0-08% 0-50% 10 -foot bed. 53-41% 0 - 20 % 44-69% 1-06% 0 - 20 % 0-08% 0-36% 100 - 00 % 100 - 00 % Since the composition of pu^ bonate (30-4% lime) and 45-65/„ magnesia 47magnesia), it can be seen how high is the quality of the material I brought back from the Qarn Shaiba region, where material of this quality occurs under many square miles of country within an easy quarrying depth. If we reckon 2 million tons per foot thickness per square mile, it is seen that a 10 -foot bed (which is really half the exact thickness of the bed from which the second sample was taken) holds 20 million tons per square mile. It is probable that some of the ‘ chalky ’ limestones in the coastal tracts, for example near Risut, may also prove to be high grade dolomite. Unfortunately, I was not aware of the exact nature of my two samples or I should have taken samples near Risut, but I do not remember seeing such dead white material or beds as thick as those near Hanun among the exposures near Risut. Edible Ceays . 82. An unctuous clay, found in the shales of the Argillaceou: series in the scarp of the Jabal Samhan facing Murbat, is used U some of the people as an edible clay. I saw the excavations bu did not know at the time the purpose for which the material wa&lt; utilized and believed it was for pottery-making and colour-wash Mr. Little mentions as soapstone’ a clay associated with th&lt; iower beds of the middle Eocene limestone of Makalla (Gebel o] Jabal Qara) which is used as a cleansing agent (detergent), and he gives the following analysis for a sample of this ‘fullers earth r S SlHca 53,60 %’ alumina 21-60%, iron oxide 1-60% lime 2-40%, magnesia 1-87% and moisture, etc. 18-93% with s specific gravity of about 2-13 (as found) and of a pale green coloui (yellowish when dry).

As this matter is of some interest I shall quote extracts from Carter’s 1857 publication (Geological Papers on Western India), page 585. Writing of ‘chalk’, he says, ‘By chalk here is meant a soft, white, earthy limestone, or gritty calcareous deposit belonging to the Nummulitic series; there is no genuine chalk on this coast . . . ’ Then discussing the top of the argillaceous strata of Jabal Samhan, • he wrote (page 586), \ . . the argillaceous division, which presents strata of various colours, but chiefly a red one; one of which, a dark-red clay stratum, of a soapy nature, presented an excavation which the Bedouins told us was made by their women, who came there occasionally to eat the clay . . . ’ He adds, ‘ These red strata pass into white and grey, compact, limestone strata, more or less thick, more or less fine in structure, more or less lithographic in appearance, above which comes a whitish yellow, chalky deposit, more or less argillaceous, from which the Bedouins cut their pipes, and then a white, compact limestone again . . . ’ I am not able to say, without samples, whether the edible, red clay is ‘bentonitic’ but it is of course not a fuller’s earth, nor is it possible to say if the Bedouin ‘pipe’ clay is of ‘meerschaum’ (sepiolite) which Little has called ‘soapstone’ quite correctly (the Kasai specimen, not the Qara sample, which is fuller’s earth). Faints and Chert 83 There is a great abundance of small and large fragments of true flint as well as of chert and related chalcedonic and similar siliceous material to be found strewn on the bare plains of the Qarn Shaiba country from south-west of Hanun to Thenut and Obet (see paragraphs 41 and 77). Similar fragments are to be found near Risut, up the Nagar Ghaiz wadi, and also near the debouche of the Rizat (Ar’Zat) wadi and elsewhere along the southern side of the Jabal Qara in the Jurbaid or Dhufar plain If large blocks of flint were required to make 3-inch to 4 inch l-&gt; a s / ,r a r ° ^ grinding mill, then a very thorough search wou ave o made in such places as the Hanun wadi, as blocks large enough to yield such ‘balls’ are uncommon. For smaller material there is abundance of flint in the northern area, but rather spread abroad on the extensive plains (of a very bare country). wo Oara to collect even a ton of flints from any area south of the Qara mountains, between Risut and Takah. I is even Outun to find flints at all within the Qara mountains south of the A1 Quti (watershed). 4950 % Gypsum and Anhydrite 84. Although fragments of Gypsum are to be found on, and as veins in, the limestones and sandstones and slates at the head of the Ghaiz wadi, towards the Ansarit gap where the vertical veins of fibrous Gypsum are 6 to 8 inches wide, there is no_ considerable deposit which could be worked on a commercial basis for export. Gypsum, with perhaps some Anhydrite, is more common across the Jabal Qara in the Qarn Shaiba country, but it is again present, so far as my observations went, only as irregular veins and segrega tions in the limestone. I had thought, after discovering the ‘chalk’ beds not to be chalk, that what has since been proved to be pure Dolomite was massive granular Gypsum (or perhaps Anhydrite). There is so much evidence of Gypsum in that northern area that extensive deposits might be discovered, though it might be difficult to account for the sources of the Sulphuric acid which has reacted to form the Calcium sulphate. In the case of the wadi Ghaiz veins the probability is that Pyrite was present and the decom position of this Iron sulphide would yield the necessary Sulphuric acid to react with the limestone or water-carrying Calcium carbonate in solution to form Calcium sulphate [as Gypsum in its various forms —satin spar (fibrous), selenite (crystals), alabaster (fine grained), etc.]. Dark, pyritiferous shales occur with many lignitic coal seams and with carbonaceous shales among bedded limestones, and these might quite easily yield the necessary Sulphuric acid for the formation of Gypsum and become themselves so leached as to be found now as beds of ‘Multani matti’ or ‘fuller’s earth’ and the like. I noticed no such beds in Dhufar, but my traverses were such that any exhaustive search was impossible, and such clays would not be very conspicuous in scarp and cliff sections. It does not follow that, because I found no massive bed or deposit of Gypsum, none exists. Indeed, I believed the ‘chalky bed’ to be Gypsum and I was rather surprised to find it was Dolomite (the chemical formation of Dolomite from coral or foraminiferal limestone requires percolating water charged with Magnesium chloride or at least much Magnesium salt in the presence of Sodium chloride). It is quite likely that beds of Gypsum will be found towards the Nejd. Hematite (Iron Ore) 85. A fragment of specular Hematite was handed to me by Mr. Mohammad Amin Salim, who stated that it was reported to have been found in the Murbat area. I was unable to secure further specimens or any reliable information as to the source of the specular mentions ‘micaceous Hematite’, used as kohl (s y^nite) mistakenly by the Bedouin of Makalla, from several places in hat country, but his various specimens proved much of it to be51 cupriferous iron ore which was associated with veins in igneous intrusions (decomposed dykes) at Fakhida, Aidma Ras el’Aqaba, etc As the archaean peneplain has not been thoroughly examined it is not possible to say whether the specular Hematite shown to me occurs with any micaceous Hematite and in what quantity. I do not think there can be any large deposit of Hematite for iron ore. Lead Ore (Galena) Among the specimens handed to me on my arrival at Salalah on the 3rd February (see paragraph 32) was one of galena which was reported to come from the Murbat area. When I got to Murbat on the 11th February (paragraph 47) the Governor there, Sheik Ali bin Salim, gave me to understand that the Lead ore (galena) was brought from Garat Athetate, a day’s journey away, and that the man who knew the place was ill. I was sorry about this as, subsequently, I was handed a sample of several pounds weight which looked very attractive. An assay of this Lead ore, made by Messrs. R. V. Briggs &amp; Co., Ltd., Calcutta, indicated 48-6% of Lead with 7 ounces of Silver (to the ton of ore or about 15 oz. to the ton of Lead). It is not an argentiferous galena, but it is a very rich Lead ore (in quality) if the sample is at all representative of the ore-body. As I was unable to see the occurrence and do not know if there are old mines there or if the deposit is being worked at all, it is not possible to sav whether it is a workable lode or not. It appears to occur in a. limestone or marble, judging from the material adhering, and this suggests that the galena is in the metamorphic rocks (those seen m the low hills, Jabal Ali, just north of M . url ? at ) T w ^ 1 ^ 11 tinue north-eastwards along the foot of the Jabal Samhan scarp. In this connection it may be said that pure galena contains 86 6/ 0 of Lead and 134% of Sulphur and is a sulphide of Lead.

An analysis of the limestone which tastes of salt (Sodium chloride) was analyzed by Messrs. R V. Briggs &amp; Co., Ltd., Calcutta, with the following results: Calcium carbonate 92-41%, Magnesium carbonate 3-32%, Insolubles (Silica, etc.) 1-26%, Oxide of iron 0-23% and Alumina 0-17%, and 2-42% of water-soluble matter. This water- soluble matter (2-42% of the whole limestone) was composed of Calcium sulphate (0-48%), Magnesium sulphate (0-03%), Magnesium chloride (0-24%), Sodium chloride (1-67%) and a trace of Potassium chloride. The limestone itself is of high grade, but I did not collect the specimen for its quality; but for the salt it contained. Indeed, I was of the opinion that it was not a particularly high grade lime stone, and that material of better quality was there present. I was not interested in the chemical composition (for commercial utilization) of limestones in the Qarn Shaiba region when there was so much limestone near and along the coast of Dhufar, including the Miliolitic limestone of Salalah, etc. An analysis of a sample of the Miliolitic limestone from between Salalah and El Balad, made by Messrs. R. V. Briggs, gave:— Calcium carbonate . . .. . . 90-25% Calcium sulphate Magnesium carbonate Insolubles (Silica, etc.) Oxide of iron Alumina Alkalies, etc. 0-92% 4-55% 3-28% 0-17% 0-31% 0-52% Limestone of this quality is suitable for the manufacture of Portland Cement. The Magnesia content would be 2-14% (from 4-55% Magnesium carbonate) and allowing 1 -| tons of limestone per ton of cement the total Magnesia in the latter would be about 3-2% (which is below the 4% permissible in specifications of the British Standards Institution). However, while the miliolite lime- stone might be suitable for making the best quality Portland Cement, and the quantity is very large, this limestone is not as high in purity as the saliferous limestone (Nummulitic) from Hanun, and I was m\seli anxious to locate good quality limestone on, or close to, the coast for chemical purposes, such as preparing Soda Ash, Bleaching Powder or in the purification of sugar. I therefore took, as fairly average samples on the slopes as I descended to the Rizat spring on the 10 th February (see paragraph 45 ). At the time I was somewhat disappointed, as the material I was collecting appeared to be siliceous and inferior-looking to most of the limestones I had superficially noticed elsewhere in Dhufar. The results of the chemical analyses made by Messrs. R. V. Briggs &amp; Co., Ltd., are as below:—53 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3) 98-25% 97-84% 97-28% nil nil 0-19 0-85% 1-31% 0-85% 0-24% 0*18% 1*08% 0-13% 0 - 10 % 0-09% 0-07% 0 - 10 % 0-07% 0-46% - 0-47% 0-44% 100-00 100-00 100-00 Calcium carbonate Calcium sulphate Magnesium carbonate Insolubles (Silica, etc.) Oxide of iron Alumina . . Alkalies, etc. . . Total The great purity of these limestones is -evident and all three are of a quality suitable for chemical purposes, the preparation of Bleaching Powder and Calcium carbide, etc. The samples represent beds 300 or 400 feet thick, so that even if seme beds are inferior and usable only for cement or lime-burning, there are almost in exhaustible quantities of high grade limestone for all purposes, in the Rizat hills alone and from easily quarriable outcrops. Oil (Petroleum) 87. Soon after my arrival in Dhufar my attention had been drawn to an ‘oil’ seepage among the sandstones of the shore near Murbat, and I naturally made a point of examining the place (see paragraphs 48 and 52). There can be no doubt that oil has been seen by those who have drawn attention to the place, and the position is one (among seaward dipping argillaceous, marly sandstones) where a seepage might be expected from oil-bearing beds, but, as the rocks there are exposed only at low tide and covered (or largely awash) at high tide (rise and fall about 5 feet), there is also the likelihood of the seepage changing position. Unfortunately there is no undoubted seepage now, and, if there was a great seepage, it would mean that the oil-field would be out at sea under Murbat ay. As the platform of Murbat is of gneiss I should consider the prospects under Murbat bay very poor and unattractive, since, if oil-bearmg beds were proved to exist (which is not at present the case), they could only be worked by sinking shafts on the shore and driving out under the sea bed, to tap the oil from dnvages—an exceptional mining proposition under any circumstances. It happens however that this is not the only indication of oil in Dhufar, as the fault encountered in the slates at the hea o e -L Nagar Ghaiz) contained what may be bituminous rather than hgmtic “32 taesff !2Ji i««. ** sheared and flaky and without any 1 was a sheared coal seam and took a sample to see ^ the co^r lignite), as I had supposed, had been Converted into graphiticanthracite. It was, of course, mixed with stony impurities. 'The fault plane is almost vertical and trends in an east-west direction nearly, or roughly at right angles to the strike of the slaty rocks which it cuts. These slates trend north-north-west and dip at 75 degrees to the west, and are overlaid by hard, trap-like sandstones which contain veins of Gypsum along the bedding planes. The sample of the carbonaceous material was analyzed by Messrs. R. V. Briggs &amp; Co., Btd., with the following results:— Moisture on sample as received Analysis on dried sample (100°C.)

Unfortunately neither specimens react to the solvent action of alcohol, petroleum ether or benzol and do not even give a coloration, and thus, ac cording to normal tests, neither sample can be regarded as a petroleum residue at present. # Mr. O. H. Little has mentioned the Bitumen from Lahia near El Sidara (a specimen of pure black Bitumen) which assayed 96-00%56 * soluble Bitumen, 3*7% free Carbon and 0-30% mineral Ash, and stated that' it is doubtless an oxidation product of petroleum He gave a further analysis of bituminous Sandstone from the same locality (in Makalla) as follows: 19-1% soluble Bitumen, 1 * 40 / free Carbon and 79-5% mineral Ash, and stated: ‘This is evidently a Sandstone richly impregnated with bituminous or oil matter The mineral contained 80-8% of Silica and 19-2% of oxides of Iron Aluminium and Manganese. There is a close resemblance in the composition of the bituminous Sandstone of the El Sidara locality and the materials from the Ghaiz and Ansarit exposures, except that the Dhufar material is slightly higher in mineral Ash, but this may be a mere accident, and as Mr. Little says of the occurrence of this class of substance, it ‘... is an indication that petroleum existed at a former period and may still exist at greater depth \ I shall discuss this subject of a search for oil in the next section of this report, as the question of the origin of the oil, its normal geological horizon in Arabia and surrounding countries, and the structure of the strata in which ‘oil sands’ usually occur, must be carefully considered for the province of Dhufar. 89. I was not aware of any special clay as regularly used in the preparing of earthenware pottery by the people of Salalah, Hafa etc! Indeed from what I saw it seemed that they used imported Chinaware cups and plates, and skins or canvas chaguls for holding water. The subject of a good pottery clay might be taken up after Dhufar has been opened up by mineral and agricultural development. Some of the soil or sub-soil clays appear suitable for earthenware as well as for onek-makmg, but with so much soft freestone available (not to speak of the dressed stone in the ruins of El Balad and other places) there is no demand for bricks. the Ha d nun 'and^fh; EXC6Pt w VeinS ° f Salt in the Limestone of me bv sTeik 4i1 hlT 6 f f m ° re massive sam P le br °ught . &gt; k Sail bin Garwah from somewhere north-west of Hanun, I encountered no deposits of rock salt during m v tour in Dhufar nor were specimens or samples produced for my inspection' and, so I am obliged to say that workable deposits of Lck salt do not appear to be present in the province of Dhufar Nor is there any spring or well of strong brine available this side of the Neid rrL J s dS !?^ by ^J 5001 of the Mugshin, on the edge of Ar RiSal5 r \sh, and sum . . . ’ -he same n, 1-4% dently a tter . . . ’ of Iron, e in the locality , except but this rence of droleum pthI ti of this ^logical re of the isidered d in the afa, etc! inaware r.

However, salt is of impor tance to Dhufar, and at the present time small quantities are obtained from ‘pans’, by the evaporation of sea-water near Kharain, on the edge of bay at Risut, and between Okad (Augad) and the wadi marsh near Risut. The quantity now evaporated is small, but there is space for establishing a salt manufacture on a large scale. This salt would be primarily for the manufacture of Soda Ash, and the rise and fall of the tide, about 4 to 5 feet, would permit large quanti ties of salt water to be trapped at high tide to allow continuous opera tions on a large scale. Serpentine 90. Serpentine occurs among the metamorphic rocks in the low hills, Jabal Ali, near Murbat, and specimens were brought to me from further east along the foot of the Jabal Samhan scarp, but, so far as I know, the occurrences are small and irregular. The interest in Serpentine is not so much in itself as in the possible occurrence of true Asbestos, Chrysotile or fibrous Serpentine, and perhaps of Steatite (Talc). Steatite Among the specimens there were two or three of Steatite or Talc, but the material was not pure white nor pale green with a fresh appearance, but a dull white with, what seemed, rusty spots where Garnet crystals had weathered away. However, there is no doubt that Serpentine, in massive form, is present among the metamorphic rocks of the Murbat archaean platform. It is possible that the larger deposits occur with good quality Steatite or Talc, but the material shown to me is what might be designated ‘soapstone’, a general term for mineral substances possessing a soapy feel, but usually of an inferior quality to fine-grained, massive Steatite. The important fact is that a closer search for workable deposits may be justified when a detailed mineral survey of Dhufar is made. TrEmoeite Actinolite: Besides odd specimens of mica-schist, chlorite- mica-schist, etc., there were some with an amphibole (now determined as Actinolite), but which I first thought was Tremolite. However, the mineral was in a fibrous form, which is known as Asbestos (meaning incombustible). Both Actinolite and Tremolite occur in the form (fibrous) of Asbestos. The commercial kind of this amphibole Asbestos is that in which the fibres are separable, otherwise the material is not amenable to weaving into cloth or rope. None of the specimens brought to me have easily separable fibres, but it often happens that this variety weathers badly and is not as evident at first as the more solid fibrous form (having the fibres like thin long» needles, all stuck together—as is the case with the specimens;. The mineral Tremolite is a calcium-magnesium amphibole (silicate) while Actinolite is a calcium-magnesium-iron amphibole, and fibrous Serpentine (or Chrysotile, the short-fibre Asbestos) is a hydrous magnesium silicate, quite distinct from the amphibole group of minerals. Serpentine may be derived from amphibole and is invari ably a secondary mineral as the result of the alteration of basic rocks (rich in amphibole or pyroxene minerals) of igneous origin. It may thus be that these substances—Serpentine, Steatite and Tremolite (Actinolite), which have been found among the metamor- phic rocks of the Murbat plain—may prove them to be the equivalent of Mr. Lees’ Semail Igneous series, and, from the evidence above given, show that they are much older than he thought when assigning them to the Mesozoic age. There is obviously a younger Igneous series, since Mr. Little writes of Dolerite and Basalt with veins of Granite in the Ras Makalla headland.59 ^ The ite) while i fibrous hydrous group of is invari- of basic is origin, itite and tietamor- luivalent :e above ht when younger &gt;alt with * VI. INDUSTRIAL POSSIBILITIES Cement and Lime Manufacture 91. With so much Limestone present, the first question is whether the material is suitable for utilization on a profitable basis and on a large scale. The analyses which have been given in paragraph 86 , Limestones, show that the coastal Limestone, the Miliolites, are of a quality suitable for the manufacture of Portland Cement. This stone is from 8 to 20 feet thick (in places) but barely 20 feet above sea-level at Salalah, so that excavations up to 12 feet may be made without water trouble. This depth may also be regarded as the average thickness of the stone, which shows at the surface in beds 12 to 18 inches thick, dipping gently, 5 degrees, to the south, seawards. The material covers several square miles of the coastal country, but probably not continuously, being better developed between A1 Hush and Salalah to Hafa and near Takah than at intermediate places. The deposits at Murbat are also not very extensive and about 6 feet thick on any average. The Miliolite limestone is porous and friable and so can be easily crushed and made into slurry. The specific gravity of the stone is a little more than 2-00 so that about 20 cubic feet may be reckoned to a ton (one cubic foot per hundredweight). An area 440 yards square in 6 feet of workable Miliolite will, therefore, yield 500,000 tons of stone. A modern cement factory produces 500 tons of cement per day from 750 tons of Limestone, so that the yearly consumption of stone, reckoned at 400 days (to allow a margin), will be 300,000 tons of Limestone. If l/16th of a square mile yields half a million tons of stone then one square mile will yield 8 , 000,000 tons, which is a 25-year supply. The Dhufar Miliolite deposits would probably be able to supply several cement factories of the above-mentioned capacity. . 92. Portland Cement is being made at Dwarka, Kathiawar, India, from exactly similar material (Miliolitic Limestone),, often much more friable and locally spoken of as marl (which it is not, since the term ‘marl’ assumes the presence of clay). Indeed a considerable percentage of clay has to be added to make the correc slurry at the Dwarka cement works, and clay will be required at any Portland Cement works on the Dhufar plain. The Dwarka works face the Arabian Sea without any shelter from the south-west monsoon and thus the cement is carried westwards by rail, or to the new por which the Government of Baroda have established 20 miles or so to60 the north at Okha. The chief difficulty which has been laced at Dwarka, especially during and since the war, has been fuel, bike most cement works the practice was to use coal in pulverized form, but the uncertainty of getting their supplies of coal led to the works re-equipping their kilns to burn oil, fuel oil. This is now a common arrangement, i.e. for pulverized fuel furnaces to be capable of turning over to fuel oil firing in case of shortage of coal, and vice versa. I understand also that the Dwarka cement works imported considerable quantities of the Gypsum they require (to be mixed and ground with the ‘clinker’ to control the rate of setting of the powdered product—the cement) from Egypt. Some Gypsum was also being procured from Rajputana, 400 miles away by train. The amount of Gypsum needed is perhaps 5% of the cement produced, and for a works producing 300,000 tons of cement annually the Gypsum will be required at 15,000 tons a year. 93. The composition of Portland Cement varies, but, from several analyses from different makers, the variation may be from 58 to 67% of Lime, 18 to 27% of Silica, 5 to 10% of Alumina, 0 to 7% of Iron oxide, under 4% Magnesia, under 2% Alkalies and under 2-75% Sulphur anhydride. The proportions of the main com ponents are according to specifications laid down by the British Standards Institution as a result of long experience. For a Portland Cement works in Dhufar the most obvious site is near A1 Husa, somewhat west of Salalah, as it is here that 10 feet of Miliolite should be readily obtained at the surface and over more than a square mile (without interfering with the cocoanut groves which fringe the beach). The supply of Gypsum might be, at first, obtained from up the wadi Nagar Ghaiz, west-north-west of Risut, and barely 10 miles away. The problem of fuel would be similar to that at Dwarka, imports of coal or/and fuel oil. This can come from the Persian Gulf (fuel oil) on the one hand, and South Africa (coal) on the other. There remains the probability of obtaining high grade coal from the Fisao coal-field, between Musweh and Migel, south of Sur, and there is the possibility that oil may be found in Dhufar province itself. For immediate consideration fuel imports appear necessary, and the question of exporting the prepared cement to other parts of the Arabian Sea coast must introduce the subject of an anchorage. This is obviously Risut bay. Taken on its own merits a single Portland Cement works, even with a subsidiary' factory making rapid-hardening and other special grades of cement, will probably not be able to face the cost of improving the projected port of Risut on the model of Okha. However, if on Okhamandal it has been possible to establish a big cement works (at Dwarka), a new port (at Okha) and a big chemical works (at Mithapur), there should be no climatic disadvantages in Dhufar, but rather great climatic advantages. An alternative site to Salalah is of course near61 f i raced at ael. I^e ized form, the works i common of turning versa.

Sai/t and Chemical Works 94. The subject of salt-making has already been discussed in paragraph 89, and it was there stated that a small salt industry now exists at Kharain, between Okad (Augad) and Risut. The salt pans there tap sea-water from the bay of Risut, and there is sufficient space in that area to have pans over an area of 3 or 4 square miles, by using the tide and pumping. The conditions for evaporation are as good as those at Mithapur, if not better, and the salinity of the sea-water may be assumed as the same. On this basis it should not be difficult to prepare 250,000 tons of salt annually, and half this amount easily as a raw material for chemical purposes. The sea brine concentrated at Mithapur has the following com position :— Calcium carbonate .. Calcium sulphate Sodium chloride Magnesium sulphate Potassium chloride .. Calcium chloride Magnesium chloride .. Magnesium bromide .. Total Solids .. 0 - 0221 % 17-4649% 17-2666% 1-6016% 0-4569% 0-0427% 1-9532% 0-1836% 21-9816% The Mithapur chemical works are able to deal with 125,000 tons of sea salt annually, and are capable of producing 150 tons of Soda Ash daily. In addition, arrangements had been made or were being made for the outturn of the following products per day . 25 tons of Caustic soda, 7 tons of Chlorine, 2 tons of Magnesium chloride, 1 ton of Epsom salts, 2| tons of Potassium bromide, 2 tons of Hydrochloric acid, some hydrous potassium-magnesium chlor (Carnellite) and Magnesia (Magnesium oxide). Thus tbe salt obta n was not sold as common salt in the Indian market (except und certam “t^defany special investigation into the subject of making sMt at Kharain, nor E any claim made that the sea brine likely to be concentrated at this place will be ^enticd with that obtained at Mithapur, but on a general sur y e y ^.^ DroDosal to me to be some advantages in favour of the Ilhufar proposaL The wadi that comes into Risut bay from the west-north-west ^oes so through a marsh which contains saline water, but 3 or 4 mi e62 f up this wadi there should be no difficulty in getting fresh water (and I pointed out a place for a well to the State Engineer). Jt not possible to say what the yield of such a well might be, but at a rough minimum, a quarter of a cusec (about 125,000 gallons a day) may be assumed as’the dry, hot weather yield. This, at 25 gallons a head, would supply 5,000 people, which is what the chemical works (with salt works) would probably employ or have in its colony at Risut. The existing marsh could, in my opinion, be suitable engineered into a reservoir holding a considerable reserve of water (impounded from the flood discharge down the wadi). The catch ment of this wadi system is perhaps not less than 200 square miles so that with a rainfall of 12 inches and a run-off of 25% the flood or run-off water should be roughly over 180 million cubic feet (approxi mately 10,000 million gallons). If the reservoir could be made to hold such a quantity, or even a quarter of the amount, there would be ample water, mainly under gravity conditions, for a great chemical works of the standard of Mithapur. However, I am certain that the water-supply problem will not be difficult and will also be a more satisfactory and cheaper project than is the case with Mithapur in Okhamandal, Kathiawar. 96. It is in regard to its Limestone that a chemical works producing Soda Ash will have its chief problem. Mithapur uses a great deposit of dead corals’ at site. This material is of very good chemical quality, as seen in the average analysis below:— ' Silica (insolubles) Iron oxide Alumina ..

Thus there is an assured supply, in the largest possible quantity of the best kind of Limestone for chemical purposes, such as the production of Soda Ash (which incidentally yields a great deal of exceedingly high grade lime for other purposes). Oiiy-FiEi,D Development 97. In paragraphs 87 and 88 I have discussed the general field evidence at present available to me of the prospect of an oil-field m Dhufar. It is there seen that the two samples (specimens) from 9 to 12 miles west-north-west of Risut, up the wadi of the Ghaiz and on the Ansarit side of the gap, might not represent petroleum residues. To this evidence may be added the analysis of the carbonaceous shale’ from the Samhan hills (of 1907; see paragraph 80). There is a great similarity in all three analyses and, while I did not secure any ‘coal’ sample from the Murbat area, the Sultan himself showed me one, at the time of my arrival in Salalah, which had been collected in the Samhan hills area. There remains the oil show on the shore near Murbat in the argillaceous sandstones (which are dis tinctly calcareous) which dip gently seaward into Murbat bay. Those who claim to have noticed the ‘ oil ’ stated that it had a kerosene odour, and, as kerosene is a distillation product, the normal con clusion (seeing that there is no smell now) is that a castaway tin ot kerosene was wrecked on the rocks and impregnated them tor a time. However, treating the matter more seriously, from other evidence as well, of the certainty that oil, as kerosene-smelling material was noticed at the Murbat bay exposure, it is well to remember that majority of oil-fields have had ‘gas escapes in greater number than ‘oil seeoages’ The direct recovery of natural kerosene by th condensatfon of such gases is well known but it has al ?° naturally in rare cases where the conditions were suitable. I can imaeine no conditions more suitable than the Murbat bay position “leaping upwards along cracks and joints in the sandstone would be cooled by the sea-water, and any fractions which could be condensed would form light oils such as k “- ^ ^ gas escape in such a position might quite easily ^ new outl^ if the outcropping rocks were disturbed (as may easily be the case at Murbat bk where the sea drives in during the monsoon with a ^suiting strong outward undertow). Thus the general evidence for oil ls 9 ialr In two yery informat i ve contributions by Dr. G Lees (perhaps the chief authority on the geoiogy of theoihfields of ^ 'Re^okfocksTp^an OT-fcld” (BMetin, American Mso’ciation64 % f of Petroleum Geologists, Vol. 17, No. 3, March 1933, pages 299 to 340), and the other ‘The Geology of the Oil-field Belt of S.-W. Iran and Iraq’ (see Geological Magazine, Vol. hXXVII, No. 3, June 1940, pages 227 to 252), the general principles are clearly explained. In the former paper the reservoir rocks (i.e. those from which the oil is yielded up to wells) of three oil-fields are discussed. These are Masjid-i-Sulaiman, Haft Kel and Naft Khaneh. In these cases the ‘ reservoir rock ’ is a Limestone of lower Miocene age, called the Asmara Limestone. It is a fine-grained foraminiferal Limestone, mostly of low porosity, and the porosity of the rock is independent of the degree of dolomitization. It is in the fractures, joints and cracks that the oil is held and these are essential factors in the oil-yielding capacity of the rock. In the latter paper Dr. Lees has reviewed the primary conditions for oil-fields. These are: (i) The occurrence of source rocks within which oil can be formed from material constituting the rock; (ii) The presence of reservoir rocks which are able to store the oil and also deliver it up to wells; (iii) Impervious strata or cover rocks which prevent the escape of the oil upwards to the surface; and (iv) Proper structural features, arches and domes, in the strata of (ii) to allow oil to accumulate locally. 99. In Iran and Iraq the ‘source rocks’ are believed to be certain chocolate to brown-coloured strata with 15% of hydro carbon matter adsorbed in them, and which are thought to range in age from Trias or Jurassic to Eocene. In Dhufar they could well be represented by the Samhan series discussed in paragraphs 72 and 73, and which include just those strata in which the bituminous matter, etc., as well as the ‘oil show’ of Murbat bay, occurs. These strata have not been searched or studied to establish whether they carry appreciable percentages of hydrocarbon, and this evidence will be difficult to secure from such outcrops as are seen. They carry uncertain evidence of petroleum residues, which, if true, might have come during the upward escape of oil from lower strata not exposed in Dhufar. In Iran and Iraq the ‘reservoir rocks’ as stated are the Asmara Limestones of Miocene age, but it is also known that certain Eocene Limestones are ‘ reservoir rocks ’ in the Kirkuk ° ~ Them are no Oligocene and younger (Miocene) rocks in u ar, and the Limestones of the Qara mountains appear to be largely upper to middle Eocene, but I doubt whether they are functioning as reservoir rocks’. This applies also to the.basal Limestones of the Jabal Samhan which may be lower Eocene and possi y upper Cretaceous in age. The total thickness of the Limestone series of Jabal Qara and Jabal Samhan is probably not more than 3,000 feet. The next series below, the argillaceous and^0 65 arenaceous strata next below the Limestones of Jabal Qara, are at least 2,000 feet thick and may be somewhat greater. They were indicated as possible ‘source rocks’ but they might be higher in the sequence, and the true source rocks may be lower and not seen. In which case this areno-argillaceous series might be ‘cover rocks’. It is only near disturbed strata, the exposure at the head of the wadi Ghaiz and the ‘spot’' on the shore of Murbat bay, both of which I examined personally, that evidence, which might be indica tive of oil, has been found in Dhufar. My opinion is that there are potentialities of oil in Dhufar, notwithstanding the disappointing evidence so far obtained from surface exposures. 100. If there are ‘source rocks’ in Dhufar, they are not seen, although the buried strata of the areno-argillaceous series might be source rocks. If the source rocks are concealed, then the arenaceous beds of the Samhan hill series (as indicated in paragraphs 72 and 73) might be ‘ reservoir rocks ’ and the argillaceous portion of this senes would function as cover rocks. These are all matters which must remain conjectural until proof is obtained by boring. Personally, I am of the opinion, that the source rocks are not exposed anywhere in Dhufar, and that both the Samhan hill series may be ‘reservoir and ‘cover rocks’ in combination, and these under the anticlinal portion of the Qara mountains will be at a depth of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. This then is the minimum depth to which an explo ratory boring might be drilled at, say, the vicinity of Othik on t e one hand or along an east-west axial line about this position. Inere always remains a possibility that the basal beds of the Limestone series, with the lithographic type of Limestone which is often mucfi fractured, may be found to carry oil and so be the reservoir rock m Dhufar, and that the ‘cover rocks’ are the middle Locene beds. This is again pure conjecture, but it is my opinion that the strati- graphical and structural geology of Dhufar have some evidence or the belief in a local accumulation of oil. If exploratory borings in the Zeloi field were carried to depths °f 10.9 0 . 0 fe f t dlS c nnofo^t and found the strata waterlogged, then I think a 4,000 to 5 . 000 -foot boring in Dhufar well worth consideration on an anticlinal positio (which must be more precisely determined by geological mapping). Other Mineral Industries 101 I have considered the subject of Portland Cement manufac ture and that of Soda Ash. In the former case a relatively impu re &gt; though still high grade, Limestone, the Miliolitic woul e suitable; and in the latter case the high grade of Rizat springs (but there may be as good matena! near Risut and tests should be made to estabhsh this ^^^ industries the basic raw material is Limestone. The pure lime that66 f will be a by-product in preparing Soda Ash can be used for making Bleaching Powder, Calcium chloride and various other substances in which slaked lime is required. I have now to consider the Lead ore of Garat Athetate eastwards of Murbat, but unless the ore is in very great quantity the production of metal (Lead) by smelting will not be attractive for a small-scale industry, and it will be better to consider the manufacture of Lead pigments, such as ‘ Red Lead ’ and ‘ White Lead \ This might be best done near the mine, if the deposits are close to the coast, or the ore could be brought round to Risut to a factory near the chemical works. With the subject of the pre paration of Paints will come the use of some of the pure slaked lime as well the manufacture of Plaster of Paris from Gypsum. As matters stand, the supplies of Gypsum appear very restricted, and this problem of Gypsum is one of considerable importance to the cement industry. The ‘ Soapstone ’ or Talc would probably find use in the paint industry, or it might be powdered and sold as a filler for cloth or paper and for the packing and preservation of rubber goods. x All these details concern the so-to-say minor minerals along the coastal side of the Jabal Qara. On these hills it is possible that other pigments might be found, such as Red and Yellow Ochre, but I did not see any actual occurrence. 102. The northern side of the watershed, A1 Qutun, in the area I have been referring to as Qarn Shaiba, has immense resources in Limestone and in pure Dolomite. There is also evidence of Gypsum and Salt and Flints (and Chert). The reserves of these three sub stances are unknown, but do not appear large within a distance of 40 miles from the coast. One specimen from among those brought to me from within 10 miles north-west of Hanun is identified as Chalk’. It is of a pure white colour, soft and powdery, and I thought it might be 'China Clay’ but the chemical analysis shows it is a powdery Limestone or Dolomite, i.e. chalk of a kind. If there was any substance that was sufficiently attractive to fetch by building of a good motorable road over the Jabal Qara to Hanun or into that region, a more thorough search for ceramic mineral substances might be carried out. On the basis of the specimens I have collected and the knowledge I have gained of the country towards the Nejd, I think that some more expeditious mode oi travel than by camel will help greatly in opening up the country and bringing to notice minerals which have so far not been reported, or large, workable occurrences of some of those—such as Gypsum and Salt and China Clay-—which have been found so far only in small quantities. In case it is thought that a good road is not justified to tap an area fringing Ihe Sands’ (Ar Rimal) where the country is relieved to be empty , I should like to say that all the evidence I lave gleaned by studying the ' flood signs ’ in the various north draining wadi courses, as well as from the information in Mr. Bertram¥ 67 * Thomas’ book, Arabia Felix, is that the question of water-supply would seem a much simpler one than has been thought hitherto. If irrigation could somehow be introduced it is possible that the Rub’al Khali might require a change in name, and settlements in that area might lead to further discoveries of mineral substances. 103. The subject of water has already been fairly fully discussed for Dhufar generally and for the Jurbaid or coastal plain of Dhufar in particular (see paragraphs 34, 46 and 55). I have shown that considerable quantities of water not only emerge as springs, but that there is, in certain cases, as for example to the khor El Balad, and possibly to the khor Rori, an appreciable underground flow. I am not sure of the actual fall between the great spring on the Rizat wadi 5 miles north of Mahmulah (and the Sultan s shooting box at Mahmulah), but, assuming a fall of 100 feet with 18 cusecs of minimum flow, the electrical horse-power that might be generated is about 160 (and thus roughly 120 kilowatts) continuously. The formula I have used is, for power from a flowing stream, E.H.P- equals cusecs multiplied by head or fall and divided by 11 (for kilowatts divide by 15). In this way a valuable quantity of electric power would become available at Mahmulah, and from this point a minimum of 18 cusecs of water would be available-for irrigation purposes I believe that 18 cusecs of water would be ample tor nearly 3 square miles of sugar-cane (roughly 1 cusec for 100 acres). If a second area as large as 3 square miles could be irrigated, there would be assured supplies of cane for an important sugar factory. This is one example of the value of water in agriculture. There is no doubt at all that sugar-cane could be successfully grown and that a sugar factory is worth consideration near Mahmulah. Other Industries 104. As agriculture looms large in the industrial picture of Dhufar the problems and possibilities should repay examination by a suitable expert on such questions as sugar-cane etc., which might yield high-priced products. On the hills,_ Jabal Qara, although soil is fertile, I was of the opinion that it is good cattle country, and consequently grass and hay should be important considerations^ In this connection the Bents (see page 263, Southern Arabia) wrote o the ‘Qara mountains’ (Jabal Qara),; . As we happened to be there in the dry season, the grass was all brown and shppery, and t stood around us acres upon acres of hay with no one to harvest it bid after the rains the aspect of the Gara hills must be as geen and pleasant as those of Derbyshire ... I was even more surprised to learn that, because of lack of grass m the dry season, camel loads of H fieri sardines were taken up into the hills as food tor the cattle. There are fairly large herds of cattle in the hills, and there can be no68 doubt that hay could be gathered in, as I saw for myself; and there must be very cheap sardines procurable along the coast. There thus seems to me evidence for improved dairy farming and possi bilities for a fishery business also. These are, however, matters outside my own professional knowledge, and I draw attention to ^ them only because the people seem poor and unprogressive. 105. From remarks by His Highness I gathered that cocoanut oil was not a regular trade product from Dhufar, notwithstanding the thousands of cocoanut palms along the coast. Bound up with the subject of cocoanut is that of coir and of cocoanut shell, con sidered as commerce, as prepared products, the former as woven goods and the latter as converted into activated Carbon. Dr. Reginald Child has been conducting a research on cocoanuts in Ceylon and has demonstrated the superiority of cocoanut-shell charcoal as an absorbing agent; he mentioned that it was a remarkable property, used in the production of high vacua and was a main contribution in the progress of modern physics. Activated Carbon is of considerable value today, since it is in use for several purposes—purifying air, purifying carbon dioxide from fermentation, recovery of gasoline (from natural gas and benzine from coal gas), in vacuum work (making of radio valves), in decolourizing and purifying edible oils and glycerine, etc. to mention only a few items. The largest potential application is in sugar-refining. It is hardly necessary to refer to the trade in ‘frankincense’ and other gums and balm that is shipped from Salalah in the crude, although higher priced products might be prepared by skilful people. 106. Anyone who has had an opportunity of traversing the Qara mountains will have noticed the herds of cattle, the grassy A1 Qutun and the camels moving slowly upwards with their ‘scented loads of sardines. They will also see in the squalid huts at cave entrances and the frequent use of the numerous overhanging L/ime- stone beds (usually referred to as caves) a very primitive condition of living. There is great scope for progress in many directions. From the resemblance to the olive-growing areas of France I should think olives could readily be grown in the hills of Dhufar, and perhaps grapes and other fruits—oranges and lemons, etc. The tribesmen however, are rough herdsmen, not agricultural farmers; nor are they sea-farers. From the abundance of sardines and other fish there is scope for fisheries and fish products. Sharks infest the bay of Risut and the sea along the coast. I saw the huge bones of whales lying bleached on the shore of Murbat bay, and I understand that it is not unusua! to find pearls m oysters from the Dhufar sea bed. Indeed I was constantly surprised at the potentialities on the one hand and at the apparent lack of enterprise on the other.VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS Importance of Maps 107. I have indicated the maps I have used in connection with my investigations in Dhufar (see paragraph 7), but these are on too large a scale for geological mapping, and even those based on Air Information are inadequate for any detailed work, whether engineer ing projects or other development plans. A topographical survey of the Dhufar plain is an immediate necessity, and such a survey could be quickly carried out in the hills also. The map which was made by Khan Bahadur Imam Sharif for publication with the Bents book, Southern Arabia, is an example of rapid work by a trained Indian surveyor. I should compute that a trigonometrical survey accom panied by plane-table mapping and traverses for Revelling an area ol 4 500 square miles of the character of Dhufar province would require five survey parties and could be completed in 10 months at a cost or about Rs. 1,50,000. From this survey maps on the standard scales— 1 inch to the mile and 4 miles to the inch could be prepared and show contours at 50 feet intervals, and, also larger maps, 4 inches to a mile with 10 -foot interval contours at least of particular areas, say, around the various springs— Garzaz, Sahnut, Rizat, etc —or irrigation schemes and for hydro-electnc projects A detailed geological survey of this Dhufar country, on a map of 1 inch to the mile would probably cost Rs. 1,50,000, including a report of the geological structure, description of fossils and analyses of samples, and an outline of the resources, but it would not include detailed exploration and borings for petroleum. It might, in the hands of an experienced economic geologist, include the Pr^Pect 11 ^ the Talc or Soapstone, and very close examination of the bituminous matter up the Ghaiz wadi. Importance of Communications 108 Bv flying to Salalah from Karachi I saved perhaps 10 days’ sea voyage by motoring to Garzaz, Sahmrt Murbat and west of K?s U t I must have saved another 10 days in the journeys alone and the ease of getting from the aerodrome to the Palace and elsewhere k srs70 been possible to motor to Kazmeem, Heelah, Hanun, etc., and return via Obet and Othik and Mahmulah. Seeing that I travelled by camel and encountered only a few steep slopes on the route, I am confident that an easy road alignment could be quickly found on a good topographical map and that such a road might be made motorable at small expense. Possibly 200 miles of road would give access to 10 miles west-north-west of Risut, up to and round by Hanun and also eastward to near Hasik from Murbat, and on the average cost perhaps Rs.2,000 per mile or Rs.4,00,000 in all. There is already a landing ground and aerodrome at Salalah and Risut bay offers a reasonable hydroplane base as well as a fair anchorage. A tramway existed between Risut bay and the Salalah landing ground, but now lies abandoned after the war. If the above com munications were revived (and perhaps a new tramway made to limestone quarries, where these might be opened, near Rizat spring or Sahnut or elsewhere), Dhufar would rapidly attract notice and its resources might be quickly explored. Mineral Exploration of Dhufar 109. Although the nationalization of industries and the planning of development by Government is at present popular, it is a very expensive business and likely to prove exceedingly costly if handled by inexperienced individuals and departments. In most cases industrial enterprise, while encouraged by the State, has been carried out by private enterprise. It is true that in some cases the industrialist has made large profits, but it is also true that he has taken risks and faced disappointing periods. It is thus worthy of consideration whether it would not be to the advantage of the Sultanate of Oman to invite offers for mineral exploration parti cularly of such expensive items as the search for oil, the erection of a Portland Cement works, the building of a chemical works, and the ike. If an Oman Mineral Industries Ltd. were formed on reasonable terms of royalty (minimum royalty or/and dead rent), first for a P ros P e&lt; r^ ln § P er iod and then for actual mining and quarrying, the State would not be faced with serious expenses. These would be for surveys (topographical and engineering) and road construction Induce r fd l eCtl °m ° f data 0n water-suppiy. The Oman Mineral Industries Etd would carry out detailed geological and geophysical surveys as needed, as well as the prospecting and proving of the mineral deposits, excluding that of oil. Such a company might be etc-anTw7rkT nt ^ a ^ Ceramic branch, Chemical bfanch, etc and work through subsidiary companies who take out licences should^onlv 1 ^^- 011 ^ mineralS ° r P roducts - T be lease for oil should only be given to a very experienced firm. (Indeed the planning for industrial development could include evervthing-71 agriculture, fisheries, minerals, etc.—on which the State might feel it could not itself embark immediately.) The terms would include the right of the State to take up 25% of the shares of the managing agency and of any subsidiary firm, at any time, at market prices and to buy the industries outright after 25 years. Water-power and Water-suppey 110. Throughout the Report there has been mention of water, evidence of abundance of water either at springs, or signs of floods and evidence of considerable underground movement of water. There is no doubt that the Rizat and perhaps the Sahnut springs could yield electric power by establishing a hydro-electric station out in the plains at, say, Mahmulah or elsewhere convenient. The site must still permit the tail water to have command for irrigation. These details can only be fully understood and appreciated after all available data are collected—relating to volume of hot weather discharge, difference of level between places, character of water, etc. The State Engineer could do much of this if he were not too heavily engaged in other engineering duties, but with one or two qualified assistant engineers (one for irrigation questions and the other for roads and buildings) he could be freed for this important work. It might include questions of storage, say, a dam in the debouche of the Rizat spring and another downstream from Sahnut and a third, perhaps the most important, at the marsh at Risut. The problems of storage in the wadis of the Qarn Shaiba might be attended to subsequently. Recommendations 111 . I have no hesitation in saying that I consider the province of Dhufar, which has an exceptionally mild climate for southern Arabia, to be endowed with other advantages both mineral and agricultural. The mineral resources are of the kind that can be best exploited on the largest possible scale. For this reason an exploration company or corporation (private enterprise) would, 111 mv opinion, be the most efficient mode of opening up the mineral industries: Petroleum, Cement, Chemicals, etc. To encourage such industrialists the State would be well advised to have maps produced for mineral and other surveys to be properly conducted. Ihis is a relatively small expenditure, but I do not think any useful purpose will be served at this stage by a geological survey (which requires considerable field experience) until the topographical maps are ready, and even then the expense could be readily borne and the work done more expeditiously by a private firm than ^ the State (which would have to engage a geologist—a matter that is no easv at oresent owing to the lack of really experienced geologists). The subject of having an agricultural expert who had experience 11172 sugar-cane growing and sugar-making might perhaps be referred to the Government of India. In the case of any research work on cocoanuts the reference should be to the Government of Ceylon. As regards road-making and water-supply problems I suggest that such an engineer might be obtained, on loan, from the Government of Baroda (as they have had experience of Okhamandal and country similar to the coast of Dhufar). His Highness is already aware of the value of a suitable guest house or hostel near the aerodrome for the representatives of industrialists who may come to Salalah to conduct negotiations and make local enquiries and as a nucleus for offices later on. In conclusion, I must repeat that I feel a vast advance, industrially, is possible in the province of Dhufar, and this can be encouraged and accelerated by facilities of accommoda tion, communications, and by grants of licences and leases to reliable firms on generous terms. I have no fear that the tribesmen may give cause for anxiety. They are poor and proud but I am sure they will see the advantages of progress. Cyril S. Fox, 17th March, 1947. Printed 12th May, 1947.73 6 p&gt; APPENDIX Archaeology The mention of the word ‘ frankincense ’ introduces an atmosphere both of fraerance and ancient Arabia. The use of frankincense as an inflammable resin for incense was well known in the time of Moses, 1500 B.C., and there is every reason to believe that this odoriferous gum was in use in Egypt even before the balm of Gilead’ was carried there from Canaan by the Ishmaehtish merchants, b&gt; camel caravans about 2000 B.C. It is possible that the trade in frankincense from southern Arabia was carried overland on camels in those ancient times, it ^eems definite that a coastwise trade was in existence, probably from the Malabar coast of India up to Elath, near Ezion Geber at the head of the gulf of Aqaba, in the da&gt; s of Kinv Solomon (1000 B.C.). However, while the tree Balsamodendron Gileadense— wWch yielded the balm of Gilead-is not now found in the Jordan valley m Palestine, both the trees Boswellia thurifera and Balsamodtndron mynha— which yield frankincense and myrrh—are still important sources of odoriferous gums m southern Arabkin the‘Frankincense Country' (see the ‘ Description of the Frankincense Tree of Arabia with remarks on the misplacement of the Libanophorous Region m Ptolem&gt; s Geography ’ by H.

Here, again, near Takah are also the ruins of an Islamic city, Husn Mirahadh, of Mohammad bin Ahmad al Mingowi. On the sketch-map which accompanies this Report (on the Mineral Resources of Dhufar) I have marked the position of several places where there are evidences of earlier buildings or villages or towns in which the mode of living was of a higher standard than that of the people75 The Ceimate of Dhufar A great deal of new information relating to the lesser known areas of Asia has been obtained during the past ten years, but a close study of the maps of a good atlas of ten years ago reveals much that was not widely known at the time. This is particularly true of southern Arabia, as seen on the maps on pages 9, 14, 15, 54, c* C6-57 and 58-59 of the 5th Edn. (1936) of The Advanced Oxford Atlas. It is there seen that the highlands of Arabia are in the Yemen (north of Aden) with eleva tions of upwards of 7,000 feet above sea-level. The slope of the countryis north eastward into the Arabian desert and Rub’al Khali towards the Trucial Oman coast of the Persian Gulf. The fall of the land is less rapid along the southern coast76 of Arabia. In the Belel El Engris (north of Aden) it is often above 6,000 feet; in the Hadhramaut (behind Makalla) the highlands average 4,500 feet above sea-level; in the Jabal Qara and Samhan (in Dhufar) the land rises above 3,000 feet from the coast; then in the gap (250 miles wide) west of the gulf of Masira the land is barely 600 feet above sea-level. This low-lying tract of Oman trends north-west and appears to be physically a continuation of the trough in which lies the Persian Gulf of today. South of Muscat and trending north-west to south-east are the mountains of Oman (the Western and Eastern Hajar) with heights often above 6,000 feet and peaks to over 9,000 feet. Indeed it would seem that, physically, the main part of Arabia belongs to the African continent (Abyssinia or Ethiopia and Somaliland) while the mountains of Oman are part of the Iran or Persian and Baluchistan side of Asia. Somaliland acts as a barrier to moisture-laden winds to south-western Arabia and so it is that only the highlands of this region secure rain in any seasonal manner whereas the Hadhramaut as a whole has a small rainfall, diminishing eastwards to practically nil. The mountains of Oman receive the south-west (wet) monsoon and secure rain from these winds in July to September, and they also secure some rain during the north-east monsoon in January, and as a result the slopes of the Jabal Hajar are forest-clad (whereas the highlands of the Yemen are largely wood land slopes). And the highlands of Dhufar are also covered by woodland and forest in spite of the fact that they are half-way between Muscat and Aden on the coast of southern area and on the borders of the desert tract which comes to the sea at the gulf of Masira. The explanation of this evidence of rainfall and reasonable climate is that the Jabal Qara and Samhan of Dhufar are within the edge of the moisture-laden winds of the south-west mosoon. The accompanying chart shows that these winds traverse no area of land as they blow northwards along the Somaliland coast, and therefor^ arrive over Dhufar saturated with moisture. The highlands of Dhufar, averaging 3,000 to 3,500 feet, function in the same manner as the Western Ghats of Malabar and secure from 25 to 30 inches of rain in a strictly local manner. To the north eastwards these moisture-laden winds from the south and south-west pass over the low desert region without precipitating their moisture until they encounter the mountains of Oman. The north-east monsoon supplies a little rain to Dhufar, but the climate of this province of the Sultanate of Oman, and its abundant water- supply, is almost wholly due to the south-west monsoon. If Somaliland extended further eastward, Dhufar would be as hopeless a desert as the A 1 Rimal to the north, and if the Somaliland barrier was removed, the whole of south-western Arabia would enjoy the climate of Dhufar, while Dhufar would probably have an even more temperate climate than it has.77 Note on Sea-water and Brine In any problem relating to the manufacture of Soda Ash (Sodium carbonate) there are three chief raw materials concerned—high grade limestone and coke for the production of Carbon dioxide and very cheap common salt (Sodium chloride). In the Indian Soda Ash works (in the Punjab district of Jhelum, in Dhrangadra State and in Okhamandal of Baroda State) there are three different sources of salt- rock salt in the Jhelum district, brine from the Runn of Cutch and sea-water at Mithapur in Okhamandal. At Mithapur the works are on the coast, and this will be the model to follow if Soda Ash is prepared in Dhufar near Salalah (see para graphs 94 and 95 of the Report). Owing to lack of data I am not able to discuss in detail the subject of the evaporation of sea-water at Kharain on the northern shore of Risut bay. It is evaporation by the sun’s heat and a fair dry wind that is the most important factor in the preparation of cheap salt from sea-water. The factors which influence the rate of evaporation are: (i) the temperature of the air; (ii) velocity and pressure and direction of the wind; (iii) the moisture in the air; (iv) the cloudiness of the skies; and (v) the rainy days and rainfall. The effect of rainy days is partly included under cloudy skies, but the chief effect of the rainfall will be in its diluting effects both of the sea brine in the salt pans as well as that of fresh flood waters entering the sea and reducing its salinity for a time. This effect is well seen in the case of the Dead Sea where the salts in solution may vary from 278% (where the Jordan flows into it) and 27-81% (at its southern end). ^ ^ 0/ , The common average of the salts in solution in sea-water is about 3-5/0, but this may vary from less than half that (1-76% in the Black Sea which is fed by the Danube, the Dnieper and the overflow from the sea of Azov) to half as much again (4-53% in the case of the Red Sea). Although most of the salt material in solution in sea-water is Sodium chloride (2-73% out of 3-5% ^ the case of average sea-water or nearly 78% of Sodium chloride in the total dissolved salts) the proportion varies. In the case of the sea-water off the Kathiawar coast the amount of Sodium chloride is 2-68% as against 3-50 of total salts present (or only 76-5% of Sodium chloride in the total salts present). In the case of the Red Sea the amount of Sodium chloride is 3-03% out of 4-53% salts or 66-88%. . , , f Details of the composition of sea-water in parts per 100 are given be ow for A (average sea-water) and B (Bombay sea-water, presumably an average also) .— Sodium chloride ..

The brine is unsaturated until it contains 17% of salts (at about 15 degrees Centigrade), but between 17 degrees Beaume and 25 degrees Beaume it is saturated so far as Calcium sulphate is concerned, and the brine is in a meta stable state. Between 25 and 29-5 degrees Beaume the brine is in a labile state as far as Sodium chloride is concerned, and with higher concentration, up to 38-5 degrees Beaume, this salt separates. As the sea-water in the salterns concentrates to brine by evaporation, so differences in the solubility of the dissolved salts become effective. At an early stage, 11 degrees Beaume, the Calcium carbonate precipitates. Next, between 17 and 25 degrees Beaume, the Calcium sulphate (as Gypsum) separates out. The Sodium chloride reaches its unstable saturation between 25 and 30 degrees Beaume during which this salt crystallizes. Experience shows that the evaporation of sea-water is, in its less concentrated state, quicker than fresh water when exposed to the sun and wind in open sheets of water. It is thought that in suitable weather this evaporation may be one inch in three days. On the shores of Risut bay the evaporation would probably average 275 feet between October and March, 3-25 feet from April to June and 0-5 feet from July to September (7-5 feet total). Salt (Sodium chloride) is prepared at Kharain during January to June in small quantities, and there is little doubt that, if the necessary care was exercised, larger quantities of superior quality may be prepared on the northern shore of Risut bay. If the quantity of good quality salt was sufficient, it should be possible to manu facture Soda Ash (Sodium carbonate) and other chemicals near Salalah. It is, how ever, not possible to estimate the quantities and cost of manufacture of the salt without fuller data on the cloudy and rainy days on the one hand and the effect of rain and flood water in diluting the sea-water of Risut bay on the other. The impounding of the flood water in the wadi Nagar Ghaiz has been considered from a water-supply point of view, and this would reduce the dilution of the sea-water in Risut while at the same time providing fresh water. It is not to be presumed that Dhufar is the most suitable coast in the Sultanate of Oman for the manufacture of salt. A typical site would appear to be along the coast of the gulf of Masira half-way between Salalah and Muscat. The salt plain of Bar al Hikman, on the mainland opposite Masira island between Ghubat Hashish and the Masira channel, would appear to be more satisfactory. There is likely to be less cloudiness and little alteration of the sea-water during the south-west monsoon rains. It is one of the most desolate-looking regions on the coast of Oman and, for this reason, prove unattractive for the site of a large chemical works. Should limestone and sufticient fresh water be procurable in the vicinity, Bar al Hikman might be the best place for preparing Soda Ash as it is certainly a better place for making salt although 400 miles from Salalah. 78</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100058143542.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1422, ff 6-53</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100058143542.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1422, ff 6-53</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'THE GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES OF DHUFAR PROVINCE, MUSCAT AND OMAN'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-12T22:31:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (47 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This booklet contains a comprehensive geological report compiled by Sir Cyril Sankey Fox for the Omani Government in 1947.
