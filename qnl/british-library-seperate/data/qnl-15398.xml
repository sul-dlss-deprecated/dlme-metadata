                           Nerbudda,which is bound for Bengal. William Digges Latouche states that the vessel carries a packet, addressed to the Governor and Council at Bombay, which is to be forwarded from Muscat. Latouche goes on to state that it is uncertain whether the
                           Nerbuddawill touch at Muscat; he requests that Edward Galley hire a boat to accompany the vessel down the Gulf and convey the packet to Muscat, should the captain of the
                           Nerbuddathink it proper to proceed directly to India. Latouche requests that Galley write to the Broker of Muscat, directing him to forward the packet to Bombay. However, in a postscript, dated 26 August 1782, Latouche states that he has sent Jasseem, one of the factory people, to proceed with the Bombay packet to Muscat, with a letter from Latouche to the Broker, regarding the packet's dispatch. In addition, Latouche states that Jasseem carries a letter addressed by Latouche to the Shaik of Casab [Khaá¹£ab], which concerns four bales of cotton yarn.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023598787.0x00002a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
