By our royal pleasure we do hereby decree that the Order of the Khalifah shall consist of three degrees, the first being the Star of the order, to be worn on the left breast, with the collar of the Order around the neck, the second being the dollar only and the third being the Medal of the Order. We further enjoin and command the recipients of the Order to wear and display the insignia of the order on all official occasions 'which shall occur in our idtate. Hamad bin Isa alkhalifah.

I wrote to Belgrave complaining that this rather silly idea had only been disclosed to me at the last moment, remarking that I thought the ’Alan was most unsuitable for Bahrain (maliks and sarur malikis l), and adding that British subjects cannot be given the ’’order” without prior approval. 3.

A My dear Weightman, With reference to your letter which I have just received about His Highness r s intention to institute an order. This was first considered when His Highness was in England. The medals were ordered sometime later, nearly two years ago. They arrived, but nothing was done about them. Last year at the time of the acces sion celebrations owing to the local trouble it was not considered a suitable occasion for bringing them in. His Highness only decided on Tuesday last that this years anniversary would be a suitable occasion on which to present them. Until yesterday morning he had not definitely decided who were to receive them. His letter to you was received by me yesterday morning early and I sent it to you as soon as it came. The persons who will receive the medals today are:- Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa A1 Khalifah, Shaikh Aly bin iihmed Al Khalifah, iimir of Rafa, Mohomed Saleh Yusuf Shattar, Secretary of the Manamah Baladiya, and Two senior N.C.Qs of the State Police I pm responsible for wording the Alaan, which I worded^roughly on the lines of European proclamation made when any decorations were instituted. If you like I can suggest to His Highness that they should be issued on a private occasion. all of them Bahrain subjects. —k—/ MMMggpMjMMiam — 11 Telegram From To No. Dated ' 0 '.

V' 784 Dated and received 14th March 1940 We are informed by Political Agent Bahrain that Roman Catholic Bishop from Ad^n has arrived in Bahrain to open newly built Church and has brought Insignia of Cavalier of St. Sylvester from the Pope for presentation to the Shaikh. Shaikh who has been advised unofficially to decline is however intrigued by the idea but states that he will not accept it if Political Agent insists. 2. Case has been discussed with Prior in India. It has been revealed that Shaikh without giving any notice has recently produced a new Bahrain Order which he states he wishes to bestow on our officers. There is already a Muscat Order but Muscat is an independent State. Prior is of the opinion that proposed Order in Bahrain is objectionable and we agree. Case is somewhat similar to that of Mukalla reported in India Office letter No. P.Y. 2308/39 of September 7th to Colonial Office. Institution of Orders by Arab States under British protection is likely to lead to embarrassment with Indian Rulers in India. Acceptance of Order from the Pope by Shaikh of Bahrain will moreover encourage the wish to proceed with Order of his own.1 \ - 2 - 3. Subject therefore to further views of the Political Resident we recommend (a) that Shaikh should be instructed to refuse Order from the Pope and (b) that he should be informed that approval of His Majesty 1 s Government cannot be accorded to institution of Order of Chivalry by a Ruler of a State under His Majesty’s protection. = Foreign = ! ■ :CONFIDENTIAL , No. C/263 The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Political Agent, Bahrain. and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document (x). ia(\ *9 British Consulate-General, BUSHIRE.

There is some misapprehension in paragraph 2* Shaikh has not expressed desire to bestow order on our officers and has been warned that he cannot do so. 3. Political Agent considers (a) acceptance of Papal order will not affect any desire to proceed with -Bahrain order (b) that ahaikh regards iiang Sylvester as present from Pope in return for gift of land to Church (c) recalling of Bahrain decorations issued would be severe blow to prestige of very friendly ruler and that order should simply be allowed to fall into desuetude, medal of third class alone remaining. 4. I consider Bahrain order should be allowed to fall into desuetude except possibly for medal of third class which is not I believe contrary to Indian practice. 5. If Shainh is allowed to accept Papal order door is then mid* open for acceptance of decorations from European States which is open to gravest objection.

I see no objection to retention of the medal. 3. I would prefer that Shaikh should be allowed to accept Papal decoration. It is somewhat difficult to withhold permission once the offer is known to the recipient. Apart from that His Majesty’s Government are in practice disposed to treat Papal decorations in a rather different light from ioreign decorations and no untoward repercussions are expected if Shaikh is allowed to receive insignia. 4.
