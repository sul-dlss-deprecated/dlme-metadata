This constant supply of hot water is one of the most essential features necessary in the abolition of labour in any home. These Water Heaters are available in a wide range of sizes and types, and a model can be found to suit every installation. They are absolutely automatic in operation, without fumes, dirt, or external heat, and, with the price of electricity at its present low figure, compare favourably with other methods of heating water. THE COST OF RUNNING FERRANTI ELECTRIC WATER HEATER gives a supply of hot water at a fixed sum per gallon of water used at a given temperature, and when no water is being used, uses virtually no electrical energy. With electricity at |d. per unit, four gallons of water at a storage temperature of 195 degrees F. are available at the cost of 1 d. ; and the radiation losses amount to less than 1 d. per day. A comfortable hot bath can be obtained at the cost of 2 |d. AUTOMATIC OPERATION AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL J HIS is taken care of by the Thermostatic Switch, which controls the supply of electricity to the heating elements, ensuring that the water is maintained at the correct temperature, and that the consumption of current is strictly proportional to the quantity of water used. The thermostat is adjustable, and the storage temperature may be set to any degree. FERRANTI ELECTRIC WATER HEATERS4 LS CONSTRUCTION DETAI Herr ANTI WATER HEATERS Iwvc containers of heavy jTiiuge copper, the seams and joints of which are copper welded —no Holder or lead is lined in llieir construction. This container, which contains the hot water, is heavily lagged with specially treated and selected insulation material which ensures that heat loss is reduced to the lowest possible limit, and the outer steel case remains cold even when the inner container is full of practically boiling water. The outer case is finished in white or grey cellulose. The heating elements and thermostat arc housed in a special compartment and are contained in copper pockets. These pockets are mounted on a large flange plate which is fitted into the water container at its lower end. The elements and thermostat may be removed without disturbing the water in the container. An anti - drip device is fitted to displacement type heaters. Above are shown sections of typical Heaters with vertical and horizontal mounted elements. HOT WATER INSTANTLY AVAILABLE5 All semi-pressure Heaters are supplied with elbow tail piece unions so arranged that the connecting pipes can be brought in from any direction. Cold water taps on displacement Heaters are arranged for right and left hand fixing. HARD WATER AREAS. ^ I HF.SK HEATERS arc suitable for use in hard water districts, because the element loading is arranged to give a low watts density, and therefore a low skin temperature of the element pocket. They do not readily become coated with scale, and, if the storage temperature is kept at 170 175 degrees F., long periods of trouble-free use can be expected in the hardest water. CHOOSING THE CORRECT TYPE AND SIZE OF HEATER J^ERRANTI WATER HEATERS arc made in sizes from 1 \ to 60 gallons capacity, and types can be supplied, and will be found illustrated in this list, to supply one sink or basin or upwards to the complete service for a large house. For single basins or sinks the 1 b gallon displacement heater is recommended. The following table is a guide to the service obtainable from the various Heaters with a storage temperature of 195 degrees F, and about 10 gallons of hot water allowed per bath. Size of Heater.

Loading in watts. gallons None 500 5 gallons None 500 12 gallons One 1,000 15 gallons One and good supply for other purposes 1,500 20 gallons Two 2,000 30 gallons Three 2,500 40 gallons Four 3,000 60 gallons Seven 4,000 HOT WATER WITHOUT COAL FIRES7- INSTALLATION HE following diagrams show the correct method of installation of the various types of Heater which will be found illustrated in this booklet. DISPLACEMENT TYPE HEATER. To be used where only one hot water draw-off point is required, and can be connected direct to the cold water main. For use where a number of taps are to be supplied, and where an existing ball valve tank is available for the cold water supply. hot 5UPPC.T *SEMI - PRESSURE TYPE HEATERS SERIES CONNECTION. Where coal fires are used for the supply of hot water, the Heater should be connected in series with the existing system. The pipe between the cylinder and the Water Heater should be short, to obtain the full benefit. Thus connected, the water heated by the coal fire will pass from the cylinder into the lagged Electric Heater, thus economising in electricity. If the fire is out, the Electric Heater automatically takes over the water-heating duty. These have a ball valve tank incorporated in the Heater, and are used when a supply is required to a number of draw-off points, and connection to a separate ball valve tank is not available. with water important is Displacement heaters are provided pressure reducing restriction washers, and it to use the correct washers when installing. When connecting semi-pressure Heaters, it is important to provide a trap in the outlet pipe, as shown in the above diagrams,*, as near as possible to the Heater, as this very considerably reduces the pipe loss.

The purchaser may if he so desires pass a cheque or bankers draft on New York for the quoted price of the refrigerator address to State Engineer, Government of Bahrain. Further information will be supplied on request or by a call at the Electric Departments office preferably between the hours 7.30 A.M. to 8.30 A.M. or 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. Yours faithfully, Sd/- H.F.
