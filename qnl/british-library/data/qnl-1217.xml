The correspondents write that Britain’s relations with the current Imam of Muscat are very friendly, and that the Imam has made numerous commitments and sacrifices in the maintenance of the maritime peace in the Persian Gulf. Harden and Goodwin write that the Imam was surprised by British attempts to make Mombasa, in close proximity to the Imam’s dominions at Zanzibar, a protectorate. Harden and Goodwin write that the Imam has been assured of Britain’s withdrawal from Mombasa, and that the original move to make the town a protectorate was carried out without the Bombay Government’s approval.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673717.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
