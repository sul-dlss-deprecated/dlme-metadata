Sir, With reference to your telegram Bo. M 30 dated May 12th 1912 to the India Office end subsequent correspondence, I have the honour to report as follows upon my enquiries as to the pre cise position of Hawizeh and of the Turko-Persian frontier to the | 1 Borth West of that piece. 2. I submit as enclosures to this report (1) a diary in cluding a description of the country traversed, (11) a note by Lieut. H. Dibgy Beste on the astronomical observations taken by i k/ him at Hawizeh and elsewhere, (ill) a sketch map of the 1 mile - 1 inch scale of part of the Hawizeh district, (IV) a sketch map ofu the 4 mile - 1 inch scale of part of the Hawizeh district show ing the Turko-Persian frontier a- locally observed by the Arab tribes and claimed by Persia. Route Reports for the use of the Chief of the General Staff are being submitted separately. 3. It will be seen from Lieut. Digby Eeste ! e notes that bin observations confirm those recently taken by ^r. G.B. Scott Survey of India, retired, which place Kasiri in Let, 31 19 l 24-5* B . Long. 48° 40’29 H E. which is about 6 miles South .Vest of the position (Lat. 31° 21 27 Long. 48° 40' 47 M ) assigned to it by the latest Survey o f India maps, thus altering considerably its position relative to Hawizeh. The result of the triangulation by plane table, and of the astronomical observations,was to confirm the accuracy of the Commissioners 1 determination of the position of Hawizeh. This being the case , there seems no doubt that the adjustment made in the plane table sketch enclosed in your letter No. M [ $ dated-: 2 : - was neceanary, the dif ficultiee of triangulation between Shwoiyib and Kiahk-i-Baeri being in the opinion of the Surveyor sufficient to account for the discrepancy in latitudinal distance. I had hoped to be ableto visit Jufair to confirm its position, but ^ i „„»•! no- +n lark of water and of facilities for was not able to do so owing to lock oi transporting it there. ] 4 . to turn to the question of the frontier north '.Vest of Hawlt* with a view to fixing accurately the position of Bieaitin. on the ►'.arkheh, as well as Hawizeh, by triangulstion, I foan, it uest oroceed thither direct from Hasiri, extending in a forth Westerly direction the t riangulation w lich had been carried out in 191C as far os Kut Ha*him under my supervision. EiBSitln iP B01 * /o miles H.H.W. o f Hawizeh and is the last ice- bit d pi ce direction until Pusht-i-Kuh is reached, the low hills forth of the Karkheh being uninhabited except for occasional incursions of nomads such as t&gt;*&gt; Khasrlj . on their way to commit depredation* in the neighbourhood of Dizful. or of the Beni Lam wlen seeking in Persian territory a safe refuge from the importunities of the Turkish tax-gatherer. Bisaitin is therefore popularly spoken of as the limit of the Hawizeh district to the North West. thp oppiicfts of the Bani Turuf, who ex- 5.

Thence to the Azaim or in the middle the marsh some distance -A r est of Bhweiyih open water in the raiaaxw ux . l + &lt; -, +h p boundary line turned off, at some dovm the Suwaib stream until the bouno.ry indefinite point, to Kishk-i-Besri. 6. I then pressed th* Ehaikhs to give me details oi tne frontfrontier es actually obeorved and occupied by their tribesmen: this they willingly consented to do, and arranged for me to visit it by boat; it turned out to be the dry bed of a stream, some 8 miles b.W. of Bieeitin, marked Ghor-ed-Douvi1 (Hor-at-Tawil?) on the Commissioners* map; this stream they said had formerly carried the bulk of the waters of the Dowairij, but had now been dry for many years; it was known locally as the Dawoirlj Maiyit {the dead Pawsirij) or as Umm Chir. Herds o* buffaloes and tracks worn by flocks over the barren plain showed that up to this point they were undoubtedly in actual occupation of the land, the actual owners of the buffaloes being Saiyids of the Bani Turuf. Chen asked why they did not occupy the lands between Umm Chir and the frontier which they claimed for Persia, some 7 miles distant, they replied that the lands in question were barren and liable to raids by Turkish and Persian nomads, that they were waterless, the marsh water being quite undrinkable even by cattle and that they reared that they to go further westwards trouble would result. X was, in fact, unable to induce them to take me to the ,urko-Persian boundary at Ghor Muhalein which they said was beyond tuoir limits and to visit which might involve them in all sorts of calamities. They insisted so strongly on this as to raise some doubt in my mind as to whether the real boundary was not Umm Chir, but they protested that as the limit of cultivation extended westwards in the marshes, so also would they push forward their grazing limits along the edge of the marsh. 7. It will be seen from the foregoing that there is a patch of territory some 7 miles broad, bounded to the north by the 'Gnor uhaiBin' and the 'Ghor ed Douvil* and on the South by the marsh, which is not occupied (nor as far as I know claimed) by Turkey, and not occupied by Persia, though claimed locally,as Persian territory. Documentary evidence on the subject of 1 this section &amp; of the ''rentier seems to be entirely lacking, but we know that tie engineers of the ediating Commissioners in 1851 were not accom- pjsnied, by^the .Turkish Commissioner. Discussion with the Ch&lt;jikhs elicited the following arguments in support of the frontier w u ch they claimed for Persia, as distinct froo their own tribal limits ; (pftM b ^ Fo h 111 7 - Q- P^K-t ionigV -:4:- ( 1 ) that the Turks have never advanced beyond the line of -he Dawairij , and have t een careful to build their fort, referred to above, on the West bank, and that their proposals to strengthen the frontier posts do not include the establishment of eny posts beyond this line. (2) that the lends of the Dawairij main stream have never been cultivated by Turkish tribes, except for e brief period many years ago when the Bani Lam fled from Turkish territory and camped there. (3) I was informed by one Fulla *Alwen, clerk of Shaikh »Asi of the Bani Turuf, and formerly a writer on the head office of the Turkish district of Dawairij, that he himself had seen the official Turkish Kharita which gave the Dawairij as the boundary between Turkey and Persia. ( 4 ) i was informed by the Shaikhs that since the breaking of the dam on the Karkheh at Kut Hawashim (in 1837?) the silt of the river which had previously been spread over the lands in the neighbournood of Hawireh, had been deposited very rapidly on either side of the river and in the marshes which the Bani Turuf inhabit, with the result that their rice-fields have extended considerably westwards and continue to do so every year. They urged that in order to retain for Persia the natural accretions of land, and to avoid a land frontier with Turkey, to which they had the strongest practical objections, it was essential that the frontier should mn through the middle of the marsh to the old main stream of the bwairij, the poition of the frontier immediately Berth of the marsh was, they said, practically uninhabitable and therefore unlikely to be a cause of friction with the Turkish autnorities. Observations on the spot, a comparison of the present state of things with that shown on the Commissioners’ map of 1851, and my previous enquiries in 1909 and 1910 into the question of irrigation from, the Karkheh, tend to confirm the correctness of the soove view. The Karkheh is heavily laden with silt, more so, I believe, then any other River in Arabistan, and since the dam has been broken has deposited all its silt in the marshes instead of spreading it over the broad plains around Hawizeh. 8. The position therefore would appear to be that whilst ior thev o : - purposes of the present time, the adoption of the frontier ©s locally observed by Persian Tribes (Umm Chir) would cause no greet inconvenience to the Persian Gove rnment or to the Phnikh of \ r oham- nerali, e permanently satisfactory settlement can only be arrived at by the adoption of the boundary as locally observed by Turkey (Ghor Muhaisin and the Dawairij ) , which has the advantage of being a natural frontier line, not liable to disturbance by silt or other wise, and passing for practically the whole of its length from the Shatt-al-Arab to Pusht-i-Xuh whether through uninhabitable marshes, or uninhabit able deserts, thus rendering collissions between the tribes on either side of the border unlikely: this, in view of the religious hostility that exists between them is of considerable importance . The adoption of ary frontier hast of that locally recognized by Persian tribes would appear to be unjustified by anything in the preset condition or past history of the frontier, and to be most s trongly to be depr ecuted . I have the honour to be , Sir , your most obedient servant (Sd.) A. T. Wilson. Lieut. I.A. on special duty.Enclosure No. I DIARY From June 2let to July 3rd 1912 On June 2 let I left Mo hammer ah en route for Ahwaz in company with'. Xieut. H. ^ighy Keete after waiting 6 days for the s.e. M I/ALA -OR* 1 , which ha d 'been under repair at Baarah. We arrived at Ahwaz on June 22nd and left for the Turko-Persian frontier on the 2 4th at 9 p.m. a duets tom having prevented our eroding the river earlier. The Kancheh war a truck at Kut Ha was him f Atiq at daybreak the next day, and a halt made till the afternoon, when we moved on to Kut Saiyid ’All, some six miles down stream, a start 'being made at this point with plane table triangulation. Kut Saiyid *Ali is a commun ity of Saiyide living on the North bank of the Korkheh practically independent of the Ban! Turuf, and subject to the rule of the Shaikh of Mo hammer ah. On the 26th at daybreak we left for Khafajiyeh, the Headquarters 5 „ n of Shaikh ’A^i , chief of the Bani Turuf: the track lay parallel with the Karkheh, across low lying ground intersected with canals some of them four feet deep, watering extensive rice fields and finally emptying in to the belt of marshes which lies some miles South of the River. Shaikh ’A^i was very friendly, put nse up in a mat hut, and preferred me every assistance: he has been nominated this year as chief of the tribe, and has accepted responsibility to Shaikh Khazda 1 for the revenue of the tribe, which amounts to about 40,000 Tomans or nearly £8,000. We left at daybreak next day for Bisaitln, some 18 miles distant, I rode, the rest of the p arty going by bellam: the ground on both sides of the River was very marshy, and the 1 arid route crossed the river at Khafajiyeh and Kept some miles North oi it, only touching it again opposite Bisaitin. Shaikh Salih and Shaikh 'Aufi of the Bani Turuf rode with me, as well as Shaikh ’A/ti . Bieaitin is a long straggling settlement of Bani Turuf, covering three miles or so along the southern bank o&lt;* the Karkheh; the huts are well built of reeds, and are airy and roomy, whilst the marshes all round keepthe temperature down by day and night, even in the height of summer. Mosquitoes, *tr«nge to say were conspicuous by their absence, and the inhabitants, a fine healthy looking race, declared that they were seldom troubled with fever. At this point the existence of the Kerkheh as a single stream practically ends, end \ it divides up into a multitude of small channels, which serve to water the rice fields and finally discharge their waters into the marshes, which are penetrated only by narrow channels just broad enough to allow a cenos. to pass between the banks of almost im penetrable reeds growing generally in about four feet of water and 1 about nine feet high. The rice fields end some 8 miles West of Eisaitin, and the marshes commence, to continue unbrokenly till the Ehatt-al-Arab is reached above Basrah: there is no main channel through the marsh Sorth of Shwaiyib. The Arabs of Bis- aitin depend mainly upon boats to move about the country, ond can in this way reach Shwaiyib direct by e canal running acroso country without going through the main msrsh: th°y can often get to Hawizeh in the same way. I wee housed, rather grudgingly, at Bisaitin, by Shaikh 'All, the brother of Shaikh 'Asi, and next day by the letter's orders he arranged for ne to go by oellam to the locality observed frontier described elsewhere; I was unaole however to get him to make arrangements for me to see the frontier as locally observed by the Turks, which he an d his associates somewhat halfheartedly claimed as the true f rentier. On the 29th I left Bisaitin for Howizeh, hore»e and mules being smt without loads or saddles over a reed causeway through the marsh for the first 6 miles, whilst the baggage was sent by b ellam: I halted during the heat of the day at the house of Shaikh Mahaji of the Shurufa tribe, subject to Shaikh Khazal and went on in the afternoon to Hawlzeh, where our triangles joined up with those in the direction of Shwaiyib which formed part of the survey made under the supervision of the Political Resident by the same surveyor earlier in the year. I was accom modated in a cool house in the village by Jamal, the local agent of the Shaikh of Sohatnmer&amp;h, win told me that the revenue of the village of Hatfizeh was ^bout £500.(diary) -3 We opent the 50th in taking astronomical observations, leaving in the iftemoon for Kut Hawashim, instead of n&amp;Piri direct, in order to enable the surveyor to join up hi- triangles Mth hie starting ()oint on the Karkheh. We halted during the heat of the day at K , it hawaahin, end reached hasiri before ni dnight on July 1st, I nag conclude by mentioning that I endeavoured to as certain during ny journey how far snuggling was indulged in by the tribes on thi- border: 1 cane to the conclusion that the difficulties of camnuni- cetj on with Anara are so great that very little smuggling indeed is done, except to some snail extent in arms and ammunition for the Dizful market: I was assured and was satisfied that the Hawizeh market was supplied almost solely from hasiri, a little produce comi:ig from l^ohamnerah in winter, brought back by the large camel caravans which go there direct with rice.

The Instruments used were ar fallows : - One Sextant by Heath &amp; Co., Crsyford, London. Kew Certificate, elf es B. of railing, the inverting telescope being used for stellar as well as soler observations. One sextant stano.* One horizontal horizon (mercury) One Chronometer, 56 hour-, Ho. 5709. by Johannsen, of 5' diameter. One Hack //atch by '7ebb &amp; Co., Ho. 44, diameter. Artificial sights were taken at bohammerah Consulate on June 15th and June 20th by means o* equal altitudes of the sun and the error and daily rate were determined using the position of Mohammerah F.f. as given by Coramr. Beauchamp R.I ,K. i.e. , I at. 30 26 * 27 ** b* Long. 48° 1C*35 W E. The Chronometer was found to be but 2-3 seconds different from the accumulated error reckoned from artificial sights token at Masqrt 17 days previous, and the daily rate of the chron ometer between June 15th and June 20th was found to be 1.167 sec. losing as against 1.022 secs, between Masqat on J&amp;y 29th and oham— merah on June 15th. The former daily rate of the chronometer dur ing Key 1912 war .89 seconds losing. The daily rate of the Hack Thatch was .59 secs losing between June 15th and June 20th. Arrived at pasiri on June 23rd an d observations 'were taken on the Tennis Court with the following results : - Latitude 31° IQ’ol.Q*’ this was determined by reduction to meridian of^antares when both East end Jest of the meridian, the result being mesned with latitude by Pole star. Longitude 48 c 40*52“ was determined by equal altitude of the sun meaned with stellar observations. This result tallied so closely with the position determined by ' r. G ,B. Scott (Survey of India, retired) that I did not consider it advisable to alter the error and rate of the chronometer* Resultant position Lasiri Tennis court-3- ueed far reckoning thr hour engle was 48° 0» E. The observetione for latitude et Hewizeh (Eaf^tern end of town) taken by meaning sets of anteres both East and /eat of meridian with the Pole star resulted in La titude 31° 28' 2.2* H. Equal altitude p of the sun’s upper and lower limb 4 sets, were taken and a meridian distance was run thus from Hawizeh to Nasiri, the interval being 2 days. Allowing the old rate of 1.167 losing daily, the results place Hawizeh 34*8.7' West o' Hasiri which result tallied so closely with the result of Lieut. Wilson’s plane table survey that in my opinion it may be assumed that the chron- oraeter (by which the neridian distance was run) kept good time during these two days, and the difference shewn during these two days between the comparisons was result of the Hack watch going badly and not the chronometer. i.e,, Resultant position Hawizeh :- ( 1st. 31° 28'2.2' N .

Naseri was fixed astronomically and Hawizeh both astronomically and by triangulation. Position of Naseri is found to be several miles south of position hitherto assigned to it in Survey of India Maps. Position of Hawizeh is found to coincide with position indicated in identic map of 1851 Southampton 1873. Frontier north-west of Hawizeh and north of Shuaib was laid down by triangulation from Hawizeh. Western limits of Hawizeh district as observed in practice for their own convenience by the Benitruf Arabs under Hawizeh is the now dry branch of the river Houveyridge called Ghor-ed-Donvil in identic map at point where its course runs north and south, but the frontier claimed by Persia and locally observed on their side by Turks is the channel six miles further west called Ghor-el-Monsey^ine. The intervening space is uninhabitable owing to absence of drinkable water. Whichever of the two alternative points be adopted the frontier from thence southwards runs across the Ghor-el-Azem and eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shuaib as shewn in my sketch map. W 7 ilson states that above boundary has been accepted by the Turks and at no time transgressed by them. From Shuaib southwards frontier runs as shown in my sketch. Wdlson had with him my native surveyor and latter’s original survey and after applying further tests by the light of present observations he is of opinion that the relative positions of Yefair Kishki, Hawizeh, and Kishki Basri in relation to one another and to Hawizeh town are correct as shown in my sketch as submitted to Government. He considers that_ discrepancy in the distances between Hawizeh and Shat-el-Arab indicated in surveyor s plane table survey as compared with those appearing in identic map must have ‘/ occurred mainly in desert tract been Kishki Busri and Shat-el-Arab and is sufficiently explained by difficulty of satisfactory plane tabling m flat desert devoid of reliable land marks.c 4 - •r -un lo In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 23052/12. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

The map which forms an accompaniment thereto is being sent under separate cover. India Office. From the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my telegram No. M. 9, dated 6th May, I have the honour to advise despatch by this mail to your address and to the India Office, of copies of a plane table sketch showing the Turco-Persian frontier west of Hawizeh, as locally observed and occupied at present. To each copy I have attached a memorandum, of which I also enclose a duplicate herewith, explaining the status of the sketch and the data on which it has been compiled and executed. I now beg to offer the following further observations. 2. Position of Kawizeh .—It will be seen from the remarks recorded in my memorandum above mentioned that some doubt is aroused as to the accuracy of the position of Hawizeh as indicated in the map of the Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission published by the Ordnance Survey, Southampton, in 1873. This doubt is emphasised by the fact that the position also of Kut Nahr Hashim, which was determined by surveys in 1910 with reference to Nasiri (Ahwazj, was found by Lieutenant Wilson to be considerably north of the position shown on the Commissioners’ map. For this reason, in the event of any formal demarcation of the boundary on the Hawizeh side being contemplated, it would appear to be highly desirable to get that important point accurately fixed astronomically and by triangulation, with reference to some fixed point, and this is now rendered the more feasible by the fact that the position of Nasiri (Ahwaz) has recently been determined by Mr. G. B. Scott (Survey of India, retired), whose results have, I understand, been examined and accepted as correct by the Surveyor-General to the Government of India. In my telegram above quoted I have ventured to invite Government to consider whether or not such a survey can advisedly be put in hand. 3. I now pass on to the details of the sketch submitted. As one pro ceeds from Nasiri to Hawizeh extensive wheat and barley cultivation by hamlet communities, dependent on Hawizeh, commences some 15 miles east of that place and extends intermittently up to it. Similar cultivation extends, again intermittently, from Hawizeh to Shu’aib ; in fact, the whole country comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib and Kishk-i-Basri is regularly occupied and cultivated, in patches more or less frequent and extensive in proportion to the rainfall, by the Arab tribes of Bani Salih and Bani Sakain, dependent on Hawizeh and Shu’aib. The Political Secretary, I have, &amp;c., P. Z. Cox, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No. M. 18. 6th May 1912. At Sea, Sir, S. 158—2. A2 Although mainly dwellers in tents, these can hardly lie regarded as nomads in the sense that the Qashqai are nomadic, but must rather be looked upon as settled inhabitants. In the winter they spread themselves all over the tract in small tent- dwelling communities—families or clans—pasturing their flocks and cultivat ing the land around them. As soon as they have gathered their harvest, in the month of May, and sold or stored their produce, they break up their encamp ments ; and while a proportion remain with their flocks in and around Hawizeh and Shu’aib and the marshy ground north of these centres, the the rest, probably the moiety, migrate to the date-gardens of the Karim and Shatt-el-’Arab, where, like our hop-pickers in Kent, they find employment for the summer months, returning after the date-harvest at the end of September or early in October to make preparations for their winter camp. 4. Hawizeh .—Hawizeh itself, whatever it may have been in its palmy days, is at the present time a dilapidated and squalid settlement of mud- built dwellings. The resident x^opulation at the time of my visit was certainly not more than 2,000 souls. Signs of the former more extensive settlement are still of course plentiful, in the shape of ruined houses and compound walls, while numerous Imams or shrines scattered far and wide in the neighbouring country bear evidence to its former prosperity. The settlement is situated on both banks, but mainly on the left or west bank, of a stream from 50 to 100 yards wide and (in April) 4 to 5 feet deep in mid-channel, which flows from the direction of Kut Nahr Hashim and is said by the inhabitants to be the Karkheh, though it can only be one of the many tentacles of that river. The inhabitants say that at the present day this stream gives a regular flow for eight months in the year, from November to June inclusive, but during the remaining four months it dries up and they are reduced for their drinking supply to water-holes sunk in the bed. From November to June they have a regular highway by water to Shu’aib, and thence to 'Amarah on the Tigris, and this accounts for the fact that they trade with ’Amarah rather than Nasiri. 5. Shu’aib, 15} miles on a bearing of 8 degrees N. of west from Hawizeh, is a settled village of the Bani Salih, containing about 150 adult men and between 500 and 600 souls living in permanent dwellings, built and thatched with stout reeds from the adjacent marsh. Apart from the produce of the cultivation of the ground in the immediate vicinity the inhabitants also go in extensively for spearing and netting fish. The village is prettily situated on both banks of a small stream at the point where it enters the marsh. This stream, entering from the north, receives the waters of the Hawizeh stream, when flowing, but is also joined by other feeders from the north, and is said by the inhabitants never to become entirely dry. They are thus able to maintain communication with ’Amarah throughout the year, and the village possesses 12 or 15 bellams (canoes) which ply for hire and convey passengers and merchandise to and from that place. They have also water communication with the Shatt-el-’Arab at Swaib, opposite Qurneh, but seem seldom to use that channel. (Note. It is important that there should be no confusion between the villages of Shu’aib (near Hawizeh) and Swaib (on the Shatt-el-’Arab). Although the two villages are connected by one stream, a broad and specific d?stinotion is made by the inhabitants of’Arabistan in the pronunciation of the two names. The northern village is known as Shu’aib ( ) in two syllables and if reduced to writing would probably be spelt with the letter £ , while the 'latter is pronounced markedly in one syllable “ Swaib,” or more often “ Swebb.” 6. Frontier and Jurisdiction .—To the eastward of the village of Shu’aib or rather of the marsh on the edge of which it is situated, and southwards’ as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction nor of Turkish status. The marsh is clearly a natural boundary. The Bani Salih and Bani Sakain tribesmen who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract3 above referred to have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or ’Arabistan for at any rate four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal Shaikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Mania ” ruler of Hawizeh, who, in turn paid, or did not pay, it to the Central Government until 1902, at which juncture, fortunately for the Persian Government, the Shaikh of Mohammerah assumed responsibility for the district, since when the tribesmen have both paid revenue and become definitely submissive to him. . . , . . In this connection I may mention that at the time of my visit the Bani Salih Shaikhs were mustering a contingent of horsemen tor despatch to join the force which Shaikh Khaz'al was then mobilising for an expedition, if forced on him, against the Bakhtiaris. Apart from the Shaikhs and tribesmen of the Bani Salih and Bani Sakain whom we came in contact with, I lighted upon a veteran inhabitant of Shu’aib who claimed to be 138 years old, and might at any rate be regarded as fairly representing the “memory of man” in relation to the existing status quo. . .. . „ „ The universal view expressed as to the irontier was as toJlows (i.) That whatever is the boundary of the Hawizeh district in the direction under discussion, that will ipso facto be the frontier of Persia on that side. (ii.) That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. (iii.; That on the above premises the boundary claimed west of Hawizeh is the edge (or mid-channel of the stream where there is one) of the marsh which, coming down from the westward of Bisaitin in the north, passes Shu’aib village on its way south, and continues in the same direction towards the Shatt-el-’Arab. This line of frontier, as soon as it reaches a point due west of Kishk-i-Basri, is considered to break back to the latter spot, whence it can be drawn direct to the Shatt-el-’Arab at Di’aiji. The reason for the fixing of this latter landmark as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rainwater at Yafair. The limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair) at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks. This limit is considered to be reached at Kishk-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive old building of great age form a convenient landmark. 7 It will be seen that the frontier thus claimed by the local Bedouin inhabitants who, I need hardly say, have no knowledge of what has transpired in the past or what the views of the Central Government may be m the present only differs from that claimed by the Persian Government at the time of ’the Treaty of Erzeroum in that it resigns the south-western section of the tract to the bulks. p an ’ i i + i i , The “ Hor ” or marsh west of Shu aib is clearly a natural and convenient geographical frontier, and the boundary, as above described, seems a reasonable one for Persia to claim and a simple one to demarcate. 8 The point of vital importance is that Hawizeh and the “ Hawizeh district” should remain with Persia in its entirety, the reason being that it has alwavs formed an integral part of the province, and that the possession of it is strategically essential for the security of Arabistan. ^ \s at present constituted the Hawizeh district is very securely protected on the north and west bv geographical features and this fact relieves the Shaikh of Mohainmerah, as Warden of the Marches, of a great measure of anxiety in regard to the frontier in this direction. It is clearly important that these conditions should endure and should be fixed on the basis of the natural features existent. 9 I should like to mention here that the name of Shaikh Khaz al was held in great respect wherever I went, and that the air of confident securitywhich at present prevades the district and its Bedouin inhabitants affords eloquent testimony to the efficacy of the measures and policy pursued by him in regard to it during the past decade. 10. 1 may add in conclusion that Mr. C. Ritchie, Fields Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as well as lending me a surveyor, was good enough to give me the pleasure of his company on the expedition, and to bring with him a gramophone, which we utilized on various occasions to regale interested audiences from the Bedouin encampments where we bivouacked. We found it of some interest to note that their tastes seemed to incline rather to the infectious strains of Mr. Harry Lauder than to the strident rhapsodies of their Oriental choristers. 1 have forwarded a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s India Office. 1 have, &amp;c., P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to accompany Sketch showing Turco-Persian Frontier as occupied and claimed by Persia west and south of Hawizeh according to statements of local inhabitants in April 1912. (Compiled from plane table survey from Hawizeh via Shuaib to Di aift by Surveyor Firuz Bakht, under the supervision of Sir P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, April 1912.) Some explanation oi the status of this sketch and the basis on which it rests is necessary. ^ On the 18th A^ril (?) His Majesty s Government telegraphed to rhe Government of India asking for information by telegram as to the precise distance west of Hawizeh of the Turco-Persian frontier as locally observed. Available maps and records supplying no information on this point no European having visited the district for the last 50 years, and the second hand explanations of the fehaikh of Mohammerah and representatives of his being too sketchy and unintelligible to be of use, it became necessary to visit the locality before the information required by His Majesty’s Government could be supplied. The undersigned accordingly proceeded to the neighbourhood from Ahwaz on the 14th April with a native surveyor kindly supplied by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. &amp; It was understood at the time of starting that the position of Hawizeh itself, as fixed by the Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission of 1849-55 was accepted as correct and was not a matter in dispute, and consequently in order to economise time, the plane table work was commenced from ‘that point, that is from Hawizeh. On leaching the iSlialt-el- Arab, however, on completion of the iovirnev and comparing the positions of Kishk-i-Hawizeh and Kishk-i-Basri and the distances of these places and of Hawizeh from the Shatt-el-’Arab with those given m the 18 1 3 (Ordnance Survey, Southampton) edition of the Oom- ™r s , niap ’ a , co Py of ' jnoh had now been obtained, it was seen that while the plane table survey showed the position of the places named in the same longitudinal line as the Commissioner’s map, there was a considerable difference m the latitudinal posit on, the plane table map showing Kishk al- Basn and Kishk-al-Hawrzeh considerably further north, and the total distance between Hawizeh and the coast more than that shown by the Commissioner? The result of this is to suggest some doubt as to whether the position of “siotf n0t ^ fUrth6r n01 ' th than UMt aSsi ^ d byTe As, however this sketch was undertaken primarily in order to fix the position of the boundary west of Hawizeh, and as the relative positions of Hawizeh and Shuaib are not affected by the discrepancy indicated in the distances north and south, it was considered best for present purposes coaccept the position assigned to Hawizeh, Kishk-al-Hawizeh and Kishk-al- Basri bv the Commissioners as correct, and to adapt the plane table sketch to coincide witn it, and this has been done. This four mile to one inch sketch is not intended for reference in connection with the boundary at Di aiji and on the Shatt-el-’Arab, which portion is being simultaneously treated in detail on a largerscale.

Sir, Mohammerah, May 5, 1912.

This is quite what was to be expected from what is stated in Major Rawlinsons memorandum ; but Abbadan was specifi cally recognised as Persian by the Treaty of Erzeroum; therefore the analogy of land tenure in Abbadan cannot be adduced as decisive proof of Persian sovereignty over the lands between Failiyeh and the locally- recognised boundary. Persian claims re mained, as Lord Cowley wrote, to be proved. \ [2473 gg- Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to the Government of India. Sir, Mohammerah, May 5, 1912. IN continuation of my telegram of the 6th May, 1912, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Govern ment of India, a copy of a further report on the subject of the Turco-Persian boundary in the vicinity of the Shatt-el- Arab by Lieutenant Wilson, whom I deputed to re-examine the locality on the spot with a view to clearing up, if possible, doubtful points on the record. 2. To what he records I may add that when at Ahwaz a few day days ago, whilst consulting the sheikh regarding the Hawizeh boundary, I took the opportunity to question him regarding the nature of his ownership of the land between the locally-recognised boundary and Failiyeh. He stated emphatically that there was no difference whatever in the nature of his tenure there (nor had there been in the case of his father) from that existing in the case of any other lands in his jurisdic tion, as, for example, Abbadan, a part of which he has recently leased to the oil company ; that is to say, that the posses sion of the land is vested in him nor as . t; B ;8 JUN1912 riY o N 27 |SECR ET3.

Please see the annexed extract from Lieutenant Wilson’s precis :— “ When reproved by the Persian governors of Arabistan for favouring this policy (i.e., of land purchase in Turkey), the Sheikh of Mohammerah used to reply that he did so from patriotic motives and with the strategical object of securing from hostile influences areas of Turkish territory adjacent to that of Persia. “ The acquisition of lands of Umm-al- Rassis and Umm-al-Khassasif, opposite Mohammerah and Failiyeh respectively, and of the Diaji lands on the Turco-Persian frontier was used to illustrate this point of view, which found ready acceptance, and the purchase of the islands of Sham- shamiyah by the sheikh in 1909 may be quoted as another instance of this policy, although it is doubted whether it has ever been so regarded by the sheikh. It is certain, however, that the almost complete absence of active frontier disputes in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab is in no small degree due to the fact that the Sheikh of Mohammerah is the actual owner of all lands in the neighbourhood of the Turco-Persian boundary, and of all islands in the Shatt-el-Arab which might form objects of dispute.” A. P. private owner, but as tribal overlord, his hereditary rights as such having been specifically recognised by farman from the Persian Government. 3. He altogether denied that in his own time or in that of his father (i.e., since 1857) any tribute had been paid on account of any of these lands to the Government of Bussorah. 4. The bona fides of the Persian claim to the sovereignty of the above lands, as already explained, receives constructive corroboration from the fact that, though the sheikh (and his predecessors) and their tribesmen have for many years been the private proprietors of large and valuable tracts of land on the islands and mainland adjacent to the boundary, but in Turkish territory, the difference in the tenure is frankly recognised and the taxes readily paid to the Turkish authorities. There is no record of cases of such private owner ship being used to build up factitious claims designed to convert the lands into Persian territory, nor, indeed, is there the slightest inducement to do so, for, as proprietors in Turkish territory, the occupants are, on the whole, better off than their fellows in Persian jurisdiction, where the rights of land-owners are less well defined, and they are more a prey to arbitrary treatment than they are in Turkey. 5. I will postpone any further remarks on the question of the frontier pending the receipt of the further papers promised in Foreign Office despatch No. 1 of the 29th March, 1912. 6. As the question is under the lively consideration of His Majesty’s Government, I have ventured to send a copy of this letter simultaneously to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. I have, &amp;c. . . P- Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty s Consul-General for Fars, &amp;c. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Lieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. Sir IN accordance with your instructions, I yesterday revisited the Nahr-Khaiyin and made a close examination of the lands on its banks from its eastern mouth above the sheikh s palace to its western mouth at Diaiji, and I now have the honour to submit the following further details in amplification of previous correspondence 2. the position of the various canals, with their names and those of the various tracts of land which they water, are shown in the attached sketch map (scale 4' = 1 mile). The following important alterations and additions have been made —O The Khaivin Canal. —I am satisfied that the name Khaiyin is applied to the whole*canal from^ts junction with the Nahr Diaiji to its mouth above the shmkh s palace ; the small branch running north from the lower mouth and named by me orimnallv Khaiyain is called Nahr Nazailah locally. , . , • ^ ° 4 Tamar I had not previously succeeded in identifying this place, which is referred to in Mr. Parker’s memorandum of the 5th September 1910 and m subsequent corresnondence ; the identification of its position is of considerable importance, as it indicates that the boundary, as locally recognised, is identical with that claimed by the Persians in 1850, on grounds which Colonel Shed considered, m the man , well founTed! and which have gained additional force from s.xty years’ undisturbed possession. Mv failure to identify it previously is found to be due to the fact that it had been assumed from the reading of the word in English that its phonetic sound would be Tamar or Tamr, which was not recognised by any of the local people from whom enqun s were made. As I had heard from you that on your way back from Hawizeh a proper y named Tamar had been mentioned to you, 1 had no difficulty m identifying i ^yon a ‘ ly ttlom conversation with local headmen from both Persian and Turkish territory. T obtained the following further statements regarding the status quo. 1 All alike assured le that in their lifetime the boundary as now shown had never been ouestioned by Turkey, but that, on the contrary, the Turks had frequently g snecific recognition to it, and many years ago had actually buried some coal m a pi near the present line as a permanent boundary mark. The periodical cleaning o Nahr Khaiyin, they said, had always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the sheikh, whilst the cleaning of the Diaiji Canal was only undertaken unde the orders of the Turkish mudirs. This seems a point of considerable importance favouroHhe Persmn case. ^ ^ Khumaiseh lands was, they said, built some twelve years ago and has been occupied without question ever since by one of the sheikhs principal wives, and for the past six years by one of his sons who is m charge o lands though his youth at present makes his responsibility only nominal. 7 Seyyid Ghalib, a local headman of some importance who lives on the qt le “e border o/the Persian territory, was not in his house when I called there, having proceeded with a large following to Ahwaz to join the army which the sheikn is now m0bi 8 S1 Ali the individuals whom I questioned drew a very clear line of distinction between the position of the sheikh in the islands of Akawat (which is cultivated by his tribesmen), Barin and Bowarin, Shamshamiyah and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which islands he is the proprietor, and m Diaiji, where he is P rl ™t owner of extensive date groves, and his position m the lands on the Persian side of t e locally-recognised boundary. In the case of the former, he had always paid revenue to Government of Bussorah, while in the latter case he was sole master and ownei, putt g b and ejecting cultivators as he thought fit, and exercising seigniorial jurisdiction plying nc) 6 due? to the Turkish Government, who had at no time attempted to exerc.se ^ TtecStivltor^ie tenants at will of the sheikh in his capacity as head of the tribal community, and liable to ejection by him in favour of other tribesmen. I have, &amp;c. . i . . . n , , . A T WILSON. Indian Army (on special duty). Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to India Office. Sir, I HAVE the honour to enclose a copy Government ol India regarding the Tuico- Hawizeh. At Sea, May 6, 1912. of a letter which I have addressed to the Persian boundary in the neighbourhood ofshape of ruined houses and compound-walls, while numerous “ imams, or shrines, scattered far and wide in the neighbouring country bear evidence to its former ^ ^The settlement is situated on both banks, but mainly on the left, or west, bank Af a stream from 50 to 100 yards wide and (in April) 4 to 5 feet deep m mid channel, which flows from the direction of Kut Nahr Hashim, and is said by th &lt;3 inhabitants to be the Karkheh, though it can only be one of the many tentacles of mt ^^The inhabitants say that at the present day this stream gives a regular flow for eight months in the year, from November to June inclusive but during the remaining four months it dries up, and they are reduced for their drinking supply to water-holes sunk in the bed. From November to June they have a regular highway by water to Shu’aib, and thence to Amarah on the Tigris, and this accounts for the tact that they trade with Amarah rather than Nasin. . 5. Shu’aib, 1 5f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh, is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing about 150 adult men and between SO * and 600 souls living in permanent dwellings, built and thatched with stout reeds from the adjacent marsh. Apart from the produce of the cultivation of the ground in t ie immediate vicinity the inhabitants also go in extensively for spearing and netting fish. The village is prettily situated on both banks of a small stream at the point where it enters the marsh. This stream, entering from the north, receives the waters of the Hawizeh stream, vdien flowing, but is also joined by other feeders from e north, and is said by the inhabitants never to become entirely dry. ihey aie thus able to maintain communication with Amarah throughout the year, and the village possesses twelve or fifteen “ bellams ” (canoes), which ply for lure and convey passengers and merchandise to and from that place. 1 4 0 .. They have also water communication with the Shatt-el-Arab at Swaib, opposite Kurneh, but seem seldom to use that channel. Note .*—It is important that there should be no confusion between the villages of Shu’aib (near Hawizeh) and Swaib (on the Shatt-el-Arab). Although the two villages are connected by one stream, a broad and specific distinction is made by the inhabi tants of Arabistan in the pronunciation of the two names. The northern \illage is known as Shu’aib ( ) m two syllables, and if reduced to writing would probably be spelt with the letter , while the latter is pronounced markedly m one syllable &lt;c Swaib,” or more often “ Swebb.” 6. Frontier and Jurisdiction.—To the eastward of the village of Shu’aib, or rather of the marsh on the edge of which it is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction; nor of Turkish status. The marsh is clearly a natural boundary. The Beni Salih and -Beni Sakain tribesmen, who exclusively inhabit, and where possib e cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemona o Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of ai1 01 Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikl^ who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula mler of Haw , turn paid, or did not pay, it to the Central Government until 1902, at which juncture, fortunately for the Persian Government, the Sheikh of Mohammerah assumed responsibility for the district, since when the tribesmen have both paid revenue air , become definitely submissive to him. . p ^ • o -.m In this connection I may mention that at the time of my visit the Beni ball sheikhs were mustering a contingent of horsemen for dispatch to join the force w nc i Sheikh Khaz’al was then mobilising for an expedition, if forced on him, against the BathUans. ^ ^ ^ tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain whom we came in contact with, I lighted upon a veteran inhabitant of Shu aib who claimed to ie 138 years old, and might at any rate be regarded as fairly representing t e memory of man ” in relation to the existing status quo. The universal view expressed as to the frontier was as follows . (1.) That whatever is the boundary of the Hawizeh district in the direction under discussion, that will inso facto be the frontier of Persia on that side. (2.) That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. [2473 99-5] 0S3H 6 (3.) That on the above premises the boundary claimed west of Hawizeh is the edge (or mid-channel of the stream where there is one) of the marsh which, coming down from the westward of Bisaitin in the north, passes Shu’aib village on its way south, and continues in the same direction towards the Shatt-el-Arab. This line of frontier, as soon as it reaches a point due west of Kishk-i-Basri, is considered to break back to the f' latter spot, whence it can be drawn direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason for the fixing of this latter landmark as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain-water at Yafair. The limit of cultiva tion and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks. This limit is considered to be reached at Kishk-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive old building of great age form a convenient landmark. 7. It will be seen that the frontier thus claimed by the local Bedouin inhabitants, who, I need hardly say, have no knowledge of what has transpired in the past, or what the views of the Central Government may be in the present, only differs from that claimed by the Persian Government at the time of the Treaty of Erzeroum, in that it resigns the south-western section of the tract to the Turks. The “hor,’‘ or marsh, west of Shu’aib is clearly a natural and convenient geographical frontier, and the boundary, as above described, seems a reasonable one for Persia to claim and a simple one to demarcate. 8. The point of vital importance is that Hawizeh and the “ Hawizeh district ” should remain with Persia in its entirety, the reason being that it has always formed an integral part of the province, and that the possession of it is strategically essential for the security of Arabistan. As at present constituted the Hawizeh district is very securely protected on the north and west by geographical features, and this fact relieves the Sheikh of Moham- merah, as warden of the marshes, of a great measure of anxiety in regard to the frontier in this direction. It is clearly important that these conditions should endure and should be fixed on the basis of the natural features existent. 9. I should like to mention here that the name of Sheikh Khaz’al was held in great respect wherever I went, and that the air of confident security which at present pervades the district and its Bedouin inhabitants affords eloquent testimony to the efficjicy of the measures and policy pursued by him in regard to it during the past decade. 10. I may add in conclusion that Mr. C. Ritchie, fields manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, as vrell as lending me a surveyor, was good enough to give me the pleasure of his company on the expedition, and to bring with him a gramophone, which we utilised on various occasions to regale interested audiences from the Bedouin encampments where we bivouacked. ^ e found it of some interest to note that their taste seemed to incline rather to the infectious strains of Mr. Harry Lauder than to the strident rhapsodies of their Oriental choristers. I have forwarded a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s India Office. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty's Consul- General for Fars, cfcc. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Memorandum hy the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to accompany Sketch showing Turco-Persian Frontier as occupied and claimed by Persia West and South of Hawizeh according to Statements of Local Inhabitants in April 1912. (Compiled from plane table survey from Hawizeh via Shuaib to Di’aiji by Surveyor Firuz Bakht, under the supervision of Sir P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, April 1912.) SOME explanation of the stotus of this sketch and the basis on which it rests is necessary. . ( ^ )n t ? ie 18th April (?) His Majesty’s Government telegraphed to the Government of India asking for information by telegram as to the precise distance west of Hawizeh of the Turco-Persian frontier as locally observed.Available maps and records supplying no information on this point, no European having visited the district for the last fifty years, and the second-hand explanations of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and representatives of his being too sketchy and unintelligible to be of use, it became necessary to visit the locality before the information required by His Majesty’s Government could be supplied. The undersigned accordingly proceeded to the neighbourhood from Ahwaz on the 24th April with a native surveyor kindly supplied by the Anglo-Persian Oil ^ft was understood at the time of starting that the position of Hawizeh itself, as fixed by the Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission of 1849-55, was accepted as correct and was not a matter in dispute, and, consequently, in order to economise time, the plane-table work was commenced from that point, that is, from Hawizeh. ^ On reaching the Shatt-el-Arab, however, on completion of the journey, and comparing the positions of Kishk-i-Hawizeh and Kishk-i-Basri and the distances of these places and of Hawizeh from the Shatt-el-Arab with those given m the 1873 (ordnance survey, Southampton) edition of the commissioner’s map, a copy of which had now been obtained, it was seen that while the plane-table survey showed the position ol the places named in the same longitudinal line as the commissioners map, there was a considerable difference in the latitudinal position, the plane-table map showing Kishk-i- Basri and Kishk-i-Hawizeh considerably further north, and the total distance between Hawizeh and the coast more than that shown by the commissioners. The result of this is to suggest some doubt as to whether tlm position ol Hawizeh should not be further north than that assigned to it by the commissioners. As, however, this sketch was undertaken primarily m order to hx the position ol the boundary west of Hawizeh, and as the relative positions of Hawizeh and bhu aib are not affected by the discrepancy indicated in the distances north and south, it was considered best for present purposes to accept the position assigned to Hawizen, Kishk-i-Hawizeh and Kishk-i-Basri by the commissioners are correct, and to adapt the plane-table sketch to coincide with it, and this has been done. ^ , This 4-mile to 1-inch sketch is not intended for reference m connection with the boundary at Di’aiji and on the Shatt-el-Arab, which portion is being simultaneously treated in detail on a larger scale.

To what he records I may add that when at Ahwaz a few days ago, whilst consulting the Shaikh regarding the Hawizeh boundary, I took the opportunity to question him regarding the nature of his ownership of the land between the locally recognized boundary and Failiyeh. He stated emphatically that there was no difference whatever in the nature of his tenure there (nor had there been in the case of his father) from that existing in the case of any other lands m his jurisdiction, as, foi example, ’Abbadan, a part of which he has recently leased to the Oil Company; that is to say, that the possession of the land is vested in him not as private owner but as tribal overlord, his hereditary rights as such having been specifically recognized by farman from the Persian Government. 3.

In accordance with your instructions I yesterday revisited the Nahr- Khaivin and made a close examination of the lands on its banks from its eastern mouth above the Shaikh’s palace to its western mouth at Hiaiji, and I now have the honour to submit the following further details in amplification of previous correspondence. Scale 4' = 1 mile. 2. The position of the various canals, with their names, and those of the various tracts of land which they water, are shown in the attached sketch map. The following important alterations and additions have been made. 3. The Khaiyin Canal. I am satisfied that the name Khaiyin is applied to the whole canal from its junction with the Nahr Diaiji to its mouth above the Shaikh’s palace ; the small branch running north from the lower mouth and named by me originally Khaiyain is called Nahr Nazailah locally. 4. Tamar. I had not previously succeeded in identifying this place, which is referred to in Mr. Parker’s memorandum of 5th September 1910, and in subsequent correspondence : the identification of its position is of considerable importance as it indicates that the boundary as locally recognised is identical with that claimed by the Persians in 1850, on grounds which Colonel Shell considered in the main to be well founded, and which have gained additional force from 60 years undisturbed possession. My failure to identify it previously is found to be due to the fact that it had been assumed from the reading of the word in English that its phonetic sound would be Tamar or Tamr, which was not recognised by any of the local people from whom enquiries were made. As I had heard from you that on your way back from Hawizeh a property named Tamar had been mentioned to you I had no difficulty in identifying it beyond any doubt. 5. From conversation with local headmen from both Persian and Turkish territory, I obtained the following further statements regarding the status quo. All alike assured me that in their lifetime the boundary as now shown had never been questioned by Turkey, but that, on the contrary, the Turks had frequently given specific recognition to it. and many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit near the present line as a permanent boundary mark. The periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin, they said, had always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Shaikh, whilst the cleaning of the Diaiji canal was only undertaken under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. This seems a point of considerable importance in favour of the Persian case. 6. The Shaikh’s palace in the Khumaiseh lands was, they said, built some 12 years ago, and has been occupied without question ever since by one of the Shaikh's principal wives, and for the past six years by one of his sons who is in charge of the lands, though his youth at present makes his responsibility only nominal. f7. Saiyid Ghalib, a local headman of some importance, who lives on the extreme border of the Persian territory, was not in his house when I called there, having' proceeded with a large following to Ahwaz to join the army which the Shaikh is now mobilizing. 8. All the individuals whom 1 questioned drew a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Shaikh in the islands of Aqawat (which is cultivated by his tribesmen) Barin and Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm- ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which islands he is the proprietor, and in Diaiji, where he is private owner of extensive date groves, and his position in the lands on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. In the | case of the former he had always paid revenue to Government of Basrah, while in the latter case he was sole master and owner, putting in and ejecting cultivators as he thought lit, and exercising seigniorial jurisdiction, paying- no dues to the Turkish Government, who had at no time attempted to exercise authority in the lands. The cultivators are tenants at will of the Shaikh in his capacity as head of the tribal community, and liable to ejection by him in favour of other tribesmen. I have, &amp;c., A. T.
