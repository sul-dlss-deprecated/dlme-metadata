The first case (folios 1-22) involves two male ex-slaves who were apprehended by the Iranian police while travelling by boat to Henjam [Jazīreh-ye Hengām] to recover their belongings. One of the men escaped from detention and boarded HMS
                           Bideford, where his statement was passed on to the Bahrain Agency. The second case (folios 23-45) involves two men owned by the Saudi Arabian Chargé d'Affaires in Baghdad. Both men absconded to Bahrain, where their statements were taken down (folios 29 and 30-33). Both men were given manumission certificates, authorised by the Political Resident. One of the manumitted slaves later complained of being unable to find work in Bahrain, and requested permission to travel to India (folios 39-41). The office notes reveal that Agency staff considered the man 'lazy', and turned down his application for passage to India (folio 43).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
