December 7, 1933, His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. p f (M- Dear Sir: I beg to refer to Major Holmek* letters of March 21, 1932, and June 13, 1932 to you, and your answer of June 16, 1932, all of which regard the control of certain areas, delineated on a map accompanying the above letters of Major Holmes, which the Company desired to reserve for installation of additional equipment. Plan is enclosed of two pieces of land on sitra island, which the Company now wishes to take up, 115 acres and 5 acres respectively. The eastern piece is needed for the pumping plant that will handle oil through the submarine line to tank ships, for tank settings, for housing facilities of the crew operating plant and tanks, and yard room for material, The western piece is a material yard for landing and storing equipment until it can be moved to destination, upon which it is planned to install a 10-ton crane at the water's edge. The land is uncultivated and is not suitable land for this purpose. Some cultivation was attempted in the past on the eastern area mentioned above but was abandoned for the apparent reasons of the high salt content of the soil and the fact that hed rock is present an average depth of 18 inches from the surface. We assume this land is the property of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah, and thus we are entitled to its acquisition without payment. The acquisition of the land is necessary under the prospecting License because we now plan to ship oil before the end of 1934, although there is no obligation to do so. The only satisfactory means of testing the capacity of an oil field is by actually flowing the wells. This cannot be done unless there is enormous storage for the oil produced, unless the oil is burned as has been done in Iraq, or unless it is shipped, we propose to ship, and thus the installation of the necessary facilities comes under the head of prospecting.13 (IJ) THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM CO. LTD, - 2 - The sketch showing the areas selected is the result of a rough survey. As soon as the land has been actually surveyed and properly staked, an accurate plan will be sent to you. The Company is not prepared to designate additional land which might be needed for future installations and thus still wishes to reserve the areas referred to in Major Holme3 , letter of March 21st, 1932.

Dear Sir: I am enclosing a very rough sketch of the Bahrain - Sitra channel showing the point at which we propose to put in the fill and also a profile across the channel at this point showing the depth and distance it will be necessary to fill. You will note that the 20 foot opening will be left in the very deepest part. This opening will be spanned by a draw Bridge which can be opened at any time to allow the passage of boats. We made several profiles across the channel in various places, some of which ran up to as much as 1200 feet in length, which would make a very expensive fill. The shortest distance is onlv about 500'feet but the water was too much deep at that point to con sider filling. Mr. Boone, for convenience, has used meters in figurine the depth and distance on the profile. For your information, 1 meter is 3.28 feet, thus the length of the fill will be 721.6 feet and the average denth will be 4.26 feet. T 7ill you please advise as soon as possible if it is satisfactory to fill and bridge the channel at the proposed point? Yours very truly, Si/ E. a.

It was now proposed,after discussion with the Company^s representatives,to invite the Government of India,if they saw no objection,to undertake the necessary work,on a repaym ment basis so that full control for any buoys laid would be secured to Government. The Company had intimated that the i utamaard Gil company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London from the U.S.A on 4th January en route for Bahrain to deal with the question j oi the laying of the proposed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorings anfl floats. ihe meeting took note oi the position. hCONFIDENTIAL.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, CHARTING AND BUOYING- . Herewith is a Hemorandum which is, I am afraid, with all our care, rather general. The Company is, I think, looking forward to receiving some guidance from the Admiralty not only in approaching the work 'but in carrying it on, completing it ana subsequently maintaining it. It seems to me that what will he done will emerge as a result of discussions rather than from a plan worked out in detail 'before hand 'by San Francisco. Consistent with its policy to make the most of its opportunities for developing and rendering productive whatever there may he in the shape of an oil-field in Bahrain . the Company is anxious to get ahead with this work of charting and 'buoying with the utmost expedition. Therefore, I am all the more grateful to you, on the Company's 'behalf, for having so quickly arranged a meeting for the Company*s Representatives at the Admiralty.

In ooDnection with, the submarine oil loading line the Oompany proposes to lay aliout three miles out from SITRA ISLAND to put the Company into a position to ship oil, the Company desires to have all necessary marine survey data available to the east and north of Bahrain and Sitra Islands. According to the present survey data available, the Company understands that it will 'be necessary or advisable to mark a channel - possibly for a distance of some thirty miles - to enable tankers and other vessels engaged in or in connection with the Company's activities to approach safely to within three miles of Sitra Island for the purposes of anchoring and being loaded with oil, etc., etc. It will probably be required to make a survey of the channel, and to mark it properly with buoys and other markers. The Company seeks the aid of H.M,Government, insofar as the same can be given, in determining the manner of accomplishing this work, i.e. the materials required, the ships and labour that have to be employed, and the date of commencement of operations and the period of time during which operations can proceed, and the estimated cost of the operations, and on all matters incidental to the foregoing.M.03535/33. 20th JJeoember, 1933• Bear Laithwaite, As promised, I enclose a copy of the letter I am sending the Petroleum Company, about the 'buoys.

It would appear, however, that the Company has already given way and paid duty on food imported and on games and other- means of recreation for the employees; and it would be a lamentable thing.if this question were allowed to become one of importance or a source of friction between the Company and - the Local Authorities of the Government of -Battrein. *• Laithwaite Esq., Accordingly,/ India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.-2- Accordingly, I am to suggest to you that whilst you maintain your strict attitude on the question of construction and the Company does the same, the Company, through its Local Representative, should endeavour to settle the questions of the outstanding duties with the Local Authorities concerned on the broad principle of give and take# The furnishing of the Manager's house at Manama seems, from what I can understand, to he at the root of the present position, and if that is so, there should he little difficulty in sorting out what is an essential furnishing for the Manager, as an employee, leaving th» rest of the furnishings to he regarded as ''luxuries', and taxable. I thinic we have decided that motor cars used hy or in the course of the Company's business do not enter int» the question; they are obviously a part of the Company's equipment, and as such, non-dutiable. If it is convenient to you to communicate with Bahrein by letter at the end of this week, and you will let me know by telephone, I will write on the lines of this letter to Mr.Skinner as the Company's Chief Local Representative, asking him to deal with and settle thes* outstanding import duty questions.

It would also tie understood tliat these 'buoys should not he removed or changed hy the Company without the previous consent of the Government of India. It may he that the Government of India have at thcsii disposal alicady and oy way ox reserve, 'buoys which could be utilised for the Company's purposes. If this were so, and it would mean a saving of time, the Company would like to suggest that such buoys should be utilised and replaced, the cost of replacement being reckoned as the cost of the supply of buoys. It would be a convenience to the Company to know (a./ the approximatt! uosu of the ouoys (b) the approximate cost of laying the buoys (c) the yearly cost of maintenance of the buoys, including the light and (d) when the work could be corrmenced and completed. I understand that the work of laying the submariiB line with its sea terminal and the anchorage for ships using the terminal, will be undertaken under the super vision of the special Engineering party placed at the disposal of the Company by the standard Oil Company of California. This party has apparently an extensive knowledge of this kind of work. These Engineers or some of them will, I understand, arrive in London on the 4th January next en route for Bahrein. It may be that by then matters will have advanced sufficiently to justify another 'round-table' talk, such as we had on Tuesday, with the Engineering party joining in.

INDIA OFPIGS . P. Z. 106/34. Note of an interview with Mr. Ballantvne at the Cliice on ^rlciay. a^tn DecemDerT~l P3^ Consequent on informal discussion with the interested departments in the light of the Naval Commandei-in-Gniei' s telegram No. 920 of 25rQ pecemhor and of a telephone conversation with Mr. Ballantyne, I asked him to come to see me to-day to discuss the situation which had arisen in connection with the despatch of a party of 45 Americans for the purpose of laying the submarine line. a* I said on his arrival that, as I had already explained 'by telephone, had we known that so large a party of foreigners was contemplated and had we thought that the expert party to which he had referred meant more than five or six people, we should certainly have pressed, under the guarantee given by the Company at the time of the assignment, that the work should be done by British personnel. 3uch personnel were available and we had in fact made arrangements to put the expert who had advised the A.P.O.C. in similar cases in touch with them, in all the circumstances, however, and as matters had advanced so far, we did not propose to interfere with the arrangements that had been made, out I was asked to emphasise that the sudden arrival of a large party of foreigners in a small i *rab state of this- type might well be very embarrassing, that it was most important that the Americans should pay due deference to any advice they might receive from the local political authorities and should walk, extremely carefully; that the more of them who lived on board the ' 31 Segundo* the better. He would not/not misunderstand It if one warned hlrn that in the event of trouble it would probably he necessary to request the removal of the offending party. Mr. Ballantyne interrupted to say that the Company had consistently been most anxious to work harmoniously in the Gulf and had taken special pains about the selection of personnel. He could assure me that any man of the party who misbehaved would be removed long before any official protest could be made. 3. I went on to say that this was possibly a delicate subject but that we felt we had reason to compfein of a recent failure of liaison. There seemed to be an increasing tendency for the Company to deal direct with Bahrein without keeping London fully informed. As Mr. Ballantyne was aware, four departments here were closely concerned with the working of this concession, and it was most important that we should be kept in touch direct with all developments in connection with it. in recent cases neither Mr. Ballantyne nor the India Office had had information of the Company's intentions. M embarrassing situation might arise unless liaison was Improved. If he thought it desirable he was at full liberty to inform the Company that we had protested officially and were anxious that the situation should be improved. Mm. Ballantyne said that as regards the expert submarine party the Company were not to be taken as accepting our proposition that they could have been/teen required to employ British psrsonnel, 'but he would say Quite frankly that he fully realised the possible difficulties and apprehensions which the arrival of a large party of foreigners for a period of two or three months might give rise to. He appreciated the f act that we did not wish to press our odjection to the despatch of the party. We could rely on every precaution being taken to ensure that no difficulties were caused locally and the points which I had mentionea to him would he fully horne in mind. 5. On the question of liaison, he and Mr .Hamilton entirely agreed that arrangements had he en 'unsatisfactory lately. They had sent in a protest in very strong terms to the Company. Their position would, indeed, he made impossible unless they were kept in closer touch with what was going on. What had caused particular annoyance to them was that they had not been informed at the time of the Company's arrangements in connection with production and shipment (I understood this to be the arrangement for shipping 5,000 barrels a day by 1st July 1934, reported in the political Resident's telegram of 12th December, No.1124, p.Z.8020/33). He thought that as a result of the protest there would be no difficulty in future, part of the trouble arose from the fact that the Engineering Department in California had been dealing with tnat certain of the technical aspects and/it had been necessary to hustle at the last moment, because it was regarded as important to get preparatory work such as the laying of the submarine line out of the way before the beginning of the hot weather. For part of the trouble also Mr. skinner was responsible. He was a technician ana not a representative and while his local relations appeared to be/4. 'oe excellent, he aid not appear to realise on what points it was necessary to keep Lonaon in close touch with what was going on. That, too, ha thought would he remedied in future. 6. Mr. Ballantyne proceeded that, apart from a lack of appreciation of what was ana what was not important from the Lonaon point of view, Mr. Skinner was inclined to write abrupt and unsatisfactory letters. Thus, the Sheikh having recently written to make an enquiry as to the Company's intentions in regard to refining, Mr. Skinner had replied that the company had no present intention of refining locally ana that they were under no obligation so to do. That was not the type of letter to write. 7. I said that we had seen the letter and that it had been regarded as unsatisfactory. We should be writing to him on the subject in the immediate future. 8. Mr. Ballantyne said that the fact was that it was far too early to talk of detailed refining- arrangements. The Company had not yet worked out its marketing or sale arrangements, and the first thing to do was to find out how much oil there was likely to be and on what scale arrangements ought to be made and what difficulties there might be in connection with them. If the sheikh of Bahrein merely wanted a small local refinery to supply his own needs and those of his population, there would probably be no difficulty about it. There was to be a capping plant at Bahrein. 9. i said that what the Sheikh wanted was that the oil won by the Company should be refined locally, thus providing employment for his subjects and.bringing money, in the shape of wages, into Bahrein. It was not/- -0 /dy o. not merely a question of local requirements. Mr. Ballantyne saia that until natters proceeded further it was clearly impossible for the Company to commit themselves as regards refining arrangements for the reasons which he had explained. I said that presumably it was in principle desirable to refine locally on commercial grounds, since local refining would save the cost and difficulty of transporting crude oil for considerable distances. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He said that the nearest refineries of the Company (? The standard Oil) appeared to be in Mexico and the Caribbean sea. I said that was half-way round the world. He enquired whether the A .P.O .C. refined locally in the Gulf. I said 'Yes, at Abadan'. This appeared to strike him and he asked if we could get a copy of the A.P .O.C. concession, which he understood was a public document, since it might be of considerabt assistance to tne Company in formulating their further plans. I promised to do this. 10. In conclusion, I said that I thought it would be a good thing if we had a talk with Mr. Deacon, le&amp;dev of the subrrarine line party, before he went out ana further impressed on him the cons ids rat lorn to which Mr. Ballantyne's attention had been drawn. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He added that the suggestion haa been made that he should himself go out to Bahrein with the party to see local conditions and he thought that he would now do this. He would probably be away from London not more tnan three weeks in all. It would be possible to say a good deal orally to Mr.Skinner which he coula not write, and such a visit would, he thought make it still more unlikely than before that there would be any repetition of the lack of liaison and of/Translation of letter dated the 24th Hamadhan 1352(i.e. 11th January 1934}from Shaikh 'Abdullah tin 'Isa al Khalifah to Colonel Loeh, Political Agent,Bahrain.

BALLANTYNE OP THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM GOIvPANY ON THURSDAY, 18th JANUARY 1934o Ivir. Ballantyne came to see me to-day. The following points were discussed.;- (a) Chief Local Representative . Mr. Ballantyne said that owing to misunderstanding the question of filling the permanent vacancy in this appointment had not deen taken up with 3an Francisco. It would loe taken up at once ( I d ) Lighting and BuoyinR o He was anxious for a very early coimunication Isiockh of the prodalole cost of the lighting and huoying arrangements to 'be undertaken t)y the Government of India and Sk a,dvice as to the best procedure for Mr. Skinner to adopt in dealing with the matter. I suggested that we should give the Government of India, who would have to refer to the Director, Royal Indian Marine and to the lighting and buoying authorities in the Gulf, a little longer, and when they had produced figures of cost possibly ask them for advice as to the authority with whom Mr. skinner should deal, (c) British personnel . Mr. Ballantyne left the statement attached to this record snowing the position in June 19 33 and January 1934. He explained that of classes II and III (subordinate personnel) the majority were, he thought, British Indians, Bahreinis, with a few Iraqis, Egyptians, and four or five Nejdis or miscellaneous nationalities. I said we should probably ask him to furnish a further statement in due course so that we could see what progress was being made with the introduction of British personnel. . . . (d)/- a - m (a) Rep o rt ._o f ■. o p e rat Ion b of Gompa.ii.v , Mr. Ballantyne saia no ailficulty woula I ds rnaae about supplying us with report ana that San Francisco were being asked for the necessary particulars^ (e) Pearl Pishing . Enquiry made of Mr. skinner had confirmed the Company's assumption that there was no risk of any interference by the submarine line operations proposed with the pearl-fishing industry. 18th January 1934.

JfvC^L AGENC^ His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir; A iV Please refer to my letter of December 7, 1933, which referred to two pieces of land on Sitra Island upon which the Company is now preparing to install certain facilities for shipping oil. The work is progressing rapidly and materials are en route for building tanks, pump house, submarine line, land line, etc. We haye been proceeding with this work under Article 2 of the Second Schedule to the Agreement which the Company has with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin^sa Al Khalifah. We assume there is no objection to the installation of the facilities on the land mentioned. In the next to the last paragraph of the letter above referred to, it was stated that a rough sketch of the area selected ?/as enclosed and that an accurate plan would follow. For your information we have found that the short jetty with crane and the 5 acre yard as marked out on the western side of Sitra island, cannot be used for the purpose planned. We are instead putting a short pier on the eastern side of the island approximately one mile south of the location of the large tanks. In conversation with the Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrein, it developes that he has had sane complaints from owners of fishing traps in this vicinity, who believes that the installation of the pier might interfere with their traps. This matter is under investigation by the Financial Adviser and will be reported to you in the near future. On the accurate plan promised above, we will show all of the fish ^raps in question, the pier, the exact amount of land which we wish to use until it can be acquired under the Mining Lease, the location of the submarine line, tanks, and the land line to the fields.

(2) Mr.Laitnwaite briefly explained the latest developments in connection with the request of the Bahrain Petroleum Company for the assistance of H.M.G in surveying, buoying and ligntmg certain approaches to Bahrain m connection with the shipment of oil won by them. As the result of discussion at the Admiralty it had been tnougnt better,in the interests ot avoiding any excuse for tne introduction of U.S naval personnel to conduct surveys,etc.,and of keeping control of any lighting and buoying arrangements m British hands,to give the Company all possible assistance on a repayment basis. It was now proposed,aiiter discussion with the Company's representatives,to invite tne Government of India,if tney saw no objection,to undertake tne necessary work,on a repayment basis,so that full control for any buoys laid would be secured to Government. The Company /nadnad intimated tnat the Standard Oil Company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London trom the U.S.A on 4th January en route lor Bahrain to deal with the question of the laying of the propased submarine pij-eline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats.

He would not/2. not misunderstand, it if one warned iiirn that in the event of trouble it would probably be necessary to request the removal of the offending party. Mr. Ballantyne interrupted to say that the Company had coiioistently been most anxious to work harmoniously in the Gulf and had taken special pains about the selection of personnel. He could assure me that any mi1 ^ the party who misbehaved would be removed, long before any official protest could be made. 0 ' I went on to say that this was possibly a delicate subject but that we felt we had reason to com]3ain of a recent failure of liaison. There seemed to be an increasing tendency for the Company to deal direct with Bahrein without keeping London fully iniormed. As Mr. Ballantyne was aware, four departments here were closely concerned with the working of this concession, and it was most important that we should be kept in touch direct with all developments in connection with it. in recent cases neither Mr. Ballantyne nor the India Office had had information of the Company's j intentions. An embarrassing situation might arise unless liaison was improved. If he thought it desirable be was at full liberty to inform the Company that we had protested officially and were anxious that the situation should be improved, 4. Mr. Ballantyne said that as regards the expert submarine party the Company were not to be taken as accepting our proposition that they could have been/3. Deen required to employ British psrsonnel, but hs would say Quito frunkly tiicit lie fully reaXised the possible d.ifiicultibs and &amp;pprehensions which the arrival of a large party of foreigners lor a period of - two or three montns might give rise to. He appreciated the f act that we did not wish to press our objection to the despatch of the party. We could rely on every precaution being taken to ensure that no difficulties were caused locally and the points which I had mentioned to him would be fully borne in mind. 5. On the question of liaison, he and Mr.Hamilton entirely agreed that arrangements had been unsatisfactory lately. They had sent in a protest in very strong terms to the Company. Their position would, indeed, be made impossible unless they were kept in closer touch with what was going on. What had caused particular annoyance to them was that they had not been informed at the time of the Company's arrangements in connection with production and shipment (I understood this to be the arrangement for shipping 5,000 barrels a day by 1st July 1934, reported in tne Political i ?esioent' s telegram of 12th December, No. 1124, P. Z.-8020/33). He thought that as I a result of the protest there would be no difficulty in future, part of the trouble arose from the fact that the Engineering Department in California had been dealing with tnat certain of the technical aspects and/it had been necessary to hustle at the last moment, because it was regarded as important to get preparatory work such as tne laying of the submarine line out of the way before the beginning of .the hot weather. For part of the trouble also Mr. Skinner was responsible. He was a technician and not a representative and while his local relations appeared to j be/4. oe excellent, ne uici not appear to realise on what points it ^as Looebsary oo keep Loncion in close touch, with whau was goingj on. That, too, he thought would he remed ied in future. 6. Mr. Ballantyne proceeded that, apart from a lack oi appreciation oi what* was and what was not important from the Loncion point of view, Mr. Skinner was inclined to write abrupt and unsatisfactory letters. Thus, the Sheikh having recently written to make an enquiry as to the Company's intentions in regard to refining, Mr. Skinner had replied that the company had no present intention of refining locally and that they were under no obligation so to do. That was not the type of letter to write. 7. I said that we had seen the letter and that it had been regarded as unsatisfactory. We should be writing to him on the subject in the immediate future. 6. Mr. Ballantyne said that the fact was that it was far too early to talk of detailed refining arrangements. The Company had not yet worked out its marketing or sale arrangements, and the first thing to do was to find out how much oil there was likely to oe and on what scale arrangements ought to be made and what difficulties there might be in connection with them. If the .Sheikh of Bahrein merely wanted a small local refinery to supply his own needs and those oi his population, there would probably be no diiiiculty about it. There was to be a capping plant at Bahrein. 9. i said that what the .Sheitch wanted was that the oil won by the Company shoulo. be refined locally, thus providing employment for his suojects and cringing money, in the shape of wages, into Bahrein. It was not/0. not merely a question of local requiraments. iv-r. Ball ail uyne bctiQ tjiiat/ uiitj i 1. mi'tijG'rs procsscisd. lurtner it was clearly impossible for the Company to coiimit tiiefubeIves as regards refining arrangements for the reasons which he had explained. I said that presuiiHbly it v/as in principle desirable to refine locally on conmerGial grounds, since local refining would save the cost and difficulty of transporting cruue oil for consideraole distances. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He said that the nearest refineries of the Company (? The Standard Oil) appeared to be in Msxico and the Caribbean sea. I said that was half-way round the world. He enquired whether the A.P.O.C. refined locally in the Gulf. I said 'Yes, at ii Dei (18,11 ' . This appeared to strike him and he asked if we could get a copy of the A*P#C.C« concession, which he understood was a public document, since it might be of considerable assistance to trie Company in formulating their further plans. I promised to do this. 10. in conclusion, I said that I thought it would be a good thing if we had a talk with Mr. Deacon, the leader of the submarine line party, before he went out and further impressed on him the consideratiorB to which Mr. Ballantyne's attention had been drawn. Mr. Ballantyne agreed. He added that the suggestion had been made that he should himself go out to Bahrein with the party to see local conditions and he thought that he would now do this. He would probably be away from London not more than three weeks in all. It would be possible to say a good deal orally to Mr.3kinner which he could not write, and such a visit would, he thought make it still more unlikely than before that there would be any repetition of the lack of liaison and of/6.

WITH REPH23SNTATIVE 3 OP THE BAHREIN ciiim An iniorrrBl meeting took place at the Admiralty on 8th January at which there were present the Hydrographer, Mr. seal, Mr. Lalthwaite, and, from ft &lt;x/ f t^jt ; A/ V ' ( the Bahrein Petroleum Company^Mr. c.W. Deacon, Engineer in charge of the submarine line, Mr, E.J, Nelson, his assistant, and Captain Nelson, who will be in charge of the harbour installation. 2. The representatives of the Bahrein petroleum Company first discussed with the Hydrographer the technical aspects of the work which they propose to do in connection with the submarine line, and examined the charts which are being prepared for the Company. 3. A brief discussion followed on conditions in Bahrein, it being impressed on the Company's representatives that it was essential that they should keep In close touch with the political authorities and be guided by them in their general conduct. The Company's representatives expressed their anxiety to cooperate to the full with the local authorities ana with Mr. Hamilton remarking that if only for selfish reasons it was to their interest to do so. He added that the importance of leaving nothing undone to avoid any incident or difficulty had been impressed by the Company on tiie personnel who were now being sent out. 4. me Company's representatives stated that Mr. Deacon, Mr. Nelson and Captain Nelson would leave for Bahrein by air next week, arriving there about the 17th January/ (§&gt; izJaziuaiy. Iht; 'El Segunao' and its crew would arrive in Bahrein about 1st ivarcn. So far as could be judged at present the worrc was likely to take about 3 months, but i'»..r. ueacon, in the interests of leaving a wide margin, was reluctant to commit himself to its completion before o'Uly• from tntj company s point of view, however, it was desirable to finish as quickly as possible, first, because 01 the onset of the hot weather; secondly, because the retention of the 'El Segundo' ininobilised her and also involved considerable expenditure on the wages of her crew. It appeared that the crew plus the expert party would number about 45. Arrangements would be made that all save possibly two or three should live |on board. As regards arrangements for shore leave, etc., '■fi mm 1 ■■ \ the re would be no difficulty about combing with any desires which might be expressed by the local authorities 5. Mr. Ballantyne mentioned that it had now been decided that he should not go out to Bahrein with the submarine party, pressure of work making this Impossible* He added that it was probable that Captain Nelson would remain on in order to look after the harbour installation after the main party had left. He rather contemplated that in due course he would be provided with an assistant,who would be an Englishman and who would understudy him with a view to ultimately replacing him. 6. Mr, Hamilton asked the present position as regards the enquiries which had been made of the Government of India as to their willingness to arrange for lighting and buoying and was informed that a reminder had been sent asking the Government of India to indicate whether they were prepared in principle to agree to assume/3. assume responsibility. He stated that if they were not prepared to do so for any reason the Company would he ready to make arrangements, hut that in that event, in pursuance their policy ol cooperation, they would ctsk us 'to indicate wnat types, etc. ox buoy should he laiu clo^n, uiictij ijlis T'o Siioiilu d 6 comp 16 't6 conionuity ^eowjen any arrangements made oy them and the geneial arran^eiuents ol the government of India in the Gulf. iae representatives of tne Company mentioned finally tnao two ox unee shiploads of technical material for the Company's work might be expected at Bahrein in the near future. 9th January 1934.

We agree,in the first place, with the local political authorities, that the Company have no right, except un&amp;er Sshedule II Article II, to acquire or to reserve land unless and until they take out a mining lea®, and from the Resident's telegram of 23rd December, No.1165, it looks as though the Company no longer took an opposite view. 3. On the question whether there is any substance in Skinner's suggestion that they can claim to acquire land under the pi*ospecting licence in the terms oi paragraph 7 of 1 ^ his letter of 7th December to the Political Agent, Bahrein, I enclose copy of a note by our Legal Adviser. Subject to your views on the question of what works........ .may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting and the necessity of reasonable facilities fr storage, it seems on the whole (particularly as the C-mpany themselves (cf.Powle's telegram (vU Of 23rt December,, 1165) do not apparently regard themselves as entitled as of right to acquire land and if, as suggested below, we are prepared to meet them over the acquisition of .no. land/ pl+ Ung Esq., , r ' 0 1 eum Depar tmen t, Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, b. «».1»if]) land on oitra) that we should be on reasonably sure grouni in taking the line in the first instance, if w e wished to do so for bar gaining purpoises, that they were not entitled to acquire land until the mining lease had been taken out, 4. Secondly, it seems to us quite clear that, subject ta the terms of the agreement of 81st November 1933, there . can be no question that the Company must pay a royalty of Es.3/8 per ton on any oil won by them during the period of the prospecting licence. The terms of the revised Article IX of the prospecting licence are categorieal on this point and from Loch's telegram No.20, of 14th January to the Political Resident, it appears that the Company themselves take it for granted that royalty w ill b e payable. 5. We have now to consider what action to take in the light of the considerations mentioned above, which slightly alter the position discussed in the Resident's 1^1/9 letter of 18th December. 6. In taking our decision we must bear in mind that while the Company may not have the legal right to acquire or reserve areas at this stage it is very important (so long as ^ our own interests are secured) to do nothing which can be represented by the Company as justifying a delay on their part in reaching the stage of active production and s« postponing the date by which the Sheikh can expect to receive royalty consequent on commercial production having been attained. 7. The position is complicated by the fact that the areas which Holmes wished to rfeserve on behalf of the Company and for the reservation of which application is still/3. still using made 'by the Gonipany, appear to include Dart of at least one of the areas which we are now arranging to acquire for Government purposes( area-.,l). 8. Our general disposition here would I think on the whole be, in the light of the considerations above, in the first place to inform the Company that in our view tkey are not entitled to acquire or reserve land in advance of the taking out of the mining lease, save as a matter of special arrangement. Secondly, that the Sheikh, as a special concession, would, however, be prepared to allow them to take up the two areas of land on Sitra Island referred to in paragraph 7 of Skinner's letter of 7th December 1933, but that in doing so he wishes to remind the Company that this T*ill represent a special concession; that, as they are aware, he has communicated to them his desiderata in regard to the amendment of the mining lease, and that it must 'be clearly understood that in acceding to their request in this matter he does so on the understanding that due account will be given to the fact that he has done so when his proposals tor the amendment of the mining lease are being considered. Thirdly, that the Sheikh is not prepared to consider any application for the reservation of land unless and until the mining lease has been taken out. Action on these lines, if it commended itself to the other Departments, would enable the Company to go ahead with the installation ol their pumping, etc. arrangements on Sitra, and would leave us entirely free as regards the reservation of land. It might, of course, 'be possible to demand some more specific _quid-pr» auo from the Company for the grant of land on Sitra. But here/4. heic v.e ai v.- raohei' in a cleft stick 'because of our anxiety to e the Company no excuse for delaying production and so delaying payment of the increased royalties to the Sheikh, and on the whole the course suggested above seems the best compromise in the circumstances. 9. Would you let me know whether you are'in general agreement with the course of action proposed, so that, in the light of your views and those of the other Departments, we can telegraph to the Resident. The opportunity might be taken to ask the Resident to let us have a copy of the map stated to have been submitted by Holmes with his application of May 1932, and of any similar maps which maybe submitted in the future. 10. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office and to Seal at the Admiralty, with a request for an expression of their views. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.G. LAITHWAITE.Sxtract from Note by Lea:al Advispr India Office, dated l9th Januarv' 1934, ' This depends on the construction of the prospecting license« iis reaconaole to say that what the Coinpanv now proposes is within the Clause II 'to carry out such works as may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting -'? ,y The letter of 7th December from t he Company's local representative speaks of 'testing the capacity of an oil field by actually flowing the wells'. Apart from what the experts might say, it would seem reasonable that the prospecting license should be construed to include the carrying out of tests sufficient to put the licensee in a position to decide ?/hether to exercise his option or not. Further than this, it is clear from Clause IX of Schedule II that it is in contemplation that oil shall be won during the period, and a royalty paid for any quantity in excess of 100 tons. This may appear to indicate that the Company should be allowed reasonable facilities for storage or disposal even during the prospecting period, and may involve a construction of Clause II broad enough to cover it. On the other hand it seems more reasonable to say that although Clause IX is unrestricted as to the amount of oil that may be got, it would not be possible for the Company to invoke Clause II, as regards the land in respect of any quantity of oil won in excess of what might be necessary for a reasonable test; in other words, once they embarked on a commercial working the field over and above what was necessa^ lor a reasonable ^®st, they would have to look elsewhere than Clause II; i.-e. separate arrangement, or await the mining lease. It is possible that this position has been somewhat weakened by the new agreement of 21st November, 1933.THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, February 14, 1934. PA-o.

We note that you take the view that they are not entitled as of ri ht to acquire land until they have tai:en out the mining lease, and this being so we should like to make as much play as possible with the caicession involved in granting their request. We realise that the necessity for not delaying the commercial operations of the Company makes any attempt to strike a bargain something of a bluff j but we would suggest that for a first attempt, at any rate, the Company should be asked for a specific quid pro .uo. Frgm the point of view of the Sheikh as well as H.M.Government, local refining seems to be the most important of our desiderata, and we suggest therefore that some undertaking about this should be our objective. If a local refinery could be obtained the questions of producing oil to Admiralty specification and of the right of pre-emption could be left for subsequent consideration. I jam sending copies of this letter to Warner and Sbartirg Yours sincerely, (Sd.) 1. A. Seal. P.S. The foregoing remarks also dispose of the question raised in your letter P.Z.276/30 dated 20th January,1934. ^ ^laithwaite,Isq., ' India Office.,,2.938/193^ p,D.21, Part 7.

J /lo /' My dear Laithwai te, ^ With reference to your letter of January 22nd regarding the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company to be allowed to acquire land on Sitra Island it appears desirable to give the Company all the facilities we reasonably can to enable them to produce oil at an early date and not to afford them any excuse for delay in talcing out the mining lease. It is understood that the land which it is proposed to allow th® company to take up on Sitra Island does not conflict with any of the proposals for the acquisition of land for the purposes of His Majesty's Government, and that being so I entirely agree that the Company should be informed that they may be allowed to take up the two areas of land referred to in paragraph 8 of your letter as a special concession on the part of the Sheikh. I am sending copies of this letter to Warner and Seal. Tours sincerely, (Sd.) P.O.STAELI1TG• I understand that you will make it clear to Ballantyne that we expect him to take note of this - another concession - when considering our proposed amendments to the mining lease. waite, Esq., iMia Office, S.W.I.N ' m (V) THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED /&lt;?/ /to/f Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, PA-IO February 17, 1934.

'On the evening of tiie 12tn December 1933 I had a conversation with Mr.Skinner,Ghiet Local Representative of The Bahrain j Petroleum Company Limited. 2. As regards social matters 1 said that I would like to give a Christmas party for the drillers and thought that a good opportunity would be when H.M.S Colombo was m as it would give them an opportunity of meeting. I asked Mr.Skinner whether a general invitation given to the BAPCO Club would include the wives of drillers. He seemed uncertain whether it would include , them or not,unless he told them that it was intenaea to cover all including the wives. I mentioned that 1 had thought ol including them m this general invitation because they had not actually called. Mr.Skinner said rather hastily that he thought |{| that they would not call. 1 gather that at present the community is a small one and one or two of the drillers wives have been asked out,though it is not proposed when the community grows that they shall be on the calling list. 1 am not quite clear about this,and will make enquiries in due course. 3. Mr.Skinner tells me that certain attempts to interfere with their labour are still continuing and that, if ' he will make a formal complaint. I said that I would certainly not tolerate any activities directed to interfere with their labouif supply and asked him that he would inform me immediately on receiving further definite information. 1 emphasisea that the information should not come to me 24 hours afterwards but immediately that it was received. 4. I told Mr.Skinner that though there was no immediate idea of trouble on the mainland,yet there had been rumours recently that Bin Sa'ud had had a set back in T Asir. I explained that ^ some of his tribes were aisgruntlea and that ,although Ibn A. Jiluwi had Hasa in kis firm grip,one had to foresee the possibiliil ^ jii 1 1 ,if not now,later on,of trouble. I said that I did not think for a moment that their people would be interfered with but that in countries like this,it was necessary to think ahead. * fck (Ut* WV' UMr.bkinner said that his iniormation was that the tribes were ^ ie seenie&lt; ^ surprised that any of them were not law***: to Bin Sa'ud. I said that although Hasa ana the mainland was not really my affair,yet in the event of difficult ies, it would inevitably be the Political Agent,Bahrain,who would be askeo. to tish the chestnuts out of the fire^ He appreciated tnis point and said that he would let me have any information oearing on the subject from time to time» In particular I suggested that his geologists might find out and iet him know the tribes from which their escorts were taken. I said that it was no use making definite enquiries about escorts and so on and that it was Bin Sa'ud's business to provide suitable people,but that if we knew here from which tribes they were l*st~ taken^to whom to turn should there be difficulties. I suggested that direct enquiries should not be made by the geologists-but that/the type of clothing and the type of head drews adopted by the escorts would holp to*.find out to whom they belonged. 5. I emphasised strongly that entire responsibility rested with Bin Sa^d and also that my reason for taking an interest was in particular the fact that should difficulties arise it would be the Political Agent,Bahrain,who would be called upon to help. 13-12-1933.I a S .No:28.
