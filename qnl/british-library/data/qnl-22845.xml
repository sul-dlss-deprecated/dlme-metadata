On seeing the men I find that they worked for two days, diving hard in deep water and I feel that I was wrong in suggesting the amount which I did. I have now them Rs 20/- which I think is a fair amount for their work. Could you possibly ask the Captain of the Nearchus if he will pay the other Rs 10/-? If this cannot be done now I will pay it from State funds as I think the men deserve this amount, not the amount which I first suggested. Yours sincerely. Captain E. H.

I regret that daring my Ibn Jiluwi,C.I.S., Amir of Hasa, to Lieut-Colonel Loch, Political Agent, |j absence in Bushire during the Bahrain. jj — Summer, the matter was not brought to the notice of Captain Gastrell and it is now, I fear, rather late to pursue it. 3. I believe that my predecessor recovered a lighted buoy and I also believe that buoys have been recovered from the Hasa Coast from time to time in the past, but I am unable at present to trace any record of these incidents. 4. It may be that the wording is merely an hint that the ''expenses 11 incurred should be refunded, but I am afraid that it is one of a number of cases which suggests that Ibn Jiluwi is no longer willing to be helpful. 5. To drop the matter is the easiest course, but to do so may create an unfortunate precedent. 6. it it is to be pursued, two courses appear possible (i) for me to write once more to the Amir of Hasa and express *express regret for the delay, as I have been away and the matter escaped my temporary successor^ notice, and that I will gladly refund any expenses to which his Government has been put and hope that he will help the Port Director in his task of arranging for navigation by sending it back, or (ii) a request can be sent to the Sa^di \rabia Government through the Minister at Jedda. 7. On the whole, I think that the first course might be tried and, if unsuccessful, the matter might then be referred to the Sa'udi Arabia Government through the Minister. To do so, would, however, commit us to a correspondence which might bring up the questions of the position of the Political Agent Bahrain, and of Sa f udi Arab representation in Bahrain, and I should, therefore, be glad of instructions whether I should re-open the matter.

The li^ht burned was a non-flashing red light maintained on kerosene oil. A light of this type is the most suitable to the neighbourhood of the anchorage of the buoy. The buoy in question has suffered badly from wear end tear, although it has been repaired on numerous occasions; its lamp has long since been smashed and has been replaced by locally made lamps, which have frequently to be replaced after having been broken by careless lightermen. The cast-iron ballast block has become loose, and the buoy is now tilted and leaking. In effect the buoy may be said to be practically worn out. Since the Persian Gulf Lighting Authority is now interested in improving the lighting of this port, do you think it possible for this Authority to supply a new Customs Buoy to replace the present one, which should in particular bear a good bright red light ? Possibly, if this could be done, it might be thought helpful to invite the Persian Gulf Lighting Authority to assume the maintens,nee and care of the new buoy, bi^t thir.

GEORGE ROBEY—r//£ FALSTAFF. t ALKING of actors, Mr. Malcoun Morley, in his ex cellent portmanteau volume on ' The Theatre,' says in a skilful tirade that the perfect actor demands a dual personality— himself and the character he presents. That axiom became paramount when Mr. George Robey, master of a thousand revels, swapped his saddle to become the comic hero of ' Henry IV.—Part One' in Mr. Sydney Carroll's sumptuous revival at His Majesty's under the time-honoured sway of Mr. Robert Atkins. Would Mr. Robey be able to sink enough of his dominating personality in the Shakespearean character to render his well-known peculiarities forgettable and make us see the figure of Falstaff steadily and whole ? We were forewarned by tittle- tattle in the Press that the great comedian had had tussles with the text; that he, accustomed to the free-and-easy ways, both verbal and gesticular, of the music hall, had been put to great pains to memorise the bardic lines. And, indeed, at the first performance there was evidence of struggle and halt which, now and again, damped the ardour of his fellow-players, although it never impaired the clarity of the diction of this Falstaff, whose elocution, despite its deliberate pace, was a model of linguistic, coinage. Not a sentence ever strained, albeit spaced ; not a word failed to travel from the footlights to the uppermost gallery-. In this respect alone, Mr. Robey betokened that he is a master of I'art du comedien. I have never heard lightsome comedy lines so strongly individualised, and I can only conceive how much greater will be their penetration when Mr. Rol&gt;ey, by practice, will cause them to ripple from his lips. But, diction apart, his portrayal is a magnificent manifestation of an original reading. I have seen many Falstaffs, in many languages, and frankly, hitherto, I have found most performances of this burly figure elephantine and, in the long run, boresome. Sir Herbert Tree was, to a certain extent, an exception; but even he dwelt so much on the comicality of his paunch that the words became secondary to his bodily circum stantial evidence! Not so Mr. Robey. His Falstaff may have all the characteristics of a lout overfond of his sack and the rising spirit therefrom inspired. But he is not a human monstrosity, nor does he ever forget that there is a certain noblesse oblige in his origin. He, with his gay little goat-beard, his comfortable but not exce««;ive embonpoint, never looks like the famous ' covered wagon rolling along,' but, in spite of his clothes worn to shabby gentility, a gentleman of quality only falling off his perch when the spirit of sack is mightier than his will to preserva- don. When, seated on the table, he reads his homily to mentor who raises from his vast experience a few lessons of worldly wisdom, whereas in the replica in which he changes parts with the Prince, he lets it transpire that, despite his age, he preserves the spirit of youth in un alloyed gaiety. In these scenes especially, Mr. Robey convinces us that he has gripped the nature of the character in its vitals. In fact, in his impersonation, Falstaff is never a clown accentu ating his effects by extrava gant details, although more adroitly he now and again conjures up his well-known frown from his curtailed eyebrows and addresses the audience from the frontier line of the footlights in that threatening manner that adds causticity to his words. What we forcibly felt in his conception was the power of his comic vein that fulminated unceasingly even when the words were slow of birth. In short, Mr. George Robey's Falstaff was amusing from first to last. He never wearied us; in deed, we longed for him to come back when others— very meritoriously—held the stage. For he was the joy of living in the most mirthful sense of the words, and as such he will be recorded in the annals of our stage. are translated into scenes of Oriental splendour which the designers have elaborated into glamorous stage-pictures, and Sullivan's rippling music captivates the ear in ' The Rose of Persia.' Some of the dialogue might be pruned. After all, it is the tunes that charm us, and Miss Desiree Ellinger makes ' Heart's Desire ' a lovely focus for romance, ENTERTAINMENT EAST OF SUEZ. ' THERE GO ALL OF us,' AT THE DUKE OF YORK'S : MATHESON LANG, AS THE K.C., CONSULTS WITH HIS FAIR CLIENT, BARBARA KEEBLE (BEATRIX THOMSON), IN THE COURT SCENE. ' There Co All of Us ' was originally produced under the title of ' For the Defence.' The title was changed owing to possible confusion with the film, ' The Great Defender,' in which Matheson Lang recently appeared. the Prince of Wales, he is, in his paternal accents, his would-be majestical dignity, no longer a buffoon impelling the laughter of his surroundings, but a kind of mature First, d propos of nothing, for it has no relevance to my theme—unless the magic of colour and romantic set ting be counted as a link— let me call attention to the revue, ' Stop Press,' at the Adelphi. For here we have an entertainment distinguished by its originality and brilliance of production and by its witty, satirical content. Mr. Hassard Short, ably supported by Miss Doris Zinkeisen, whose designs are so delightfully attractive, has used his material, much of it particularly good in its pointed dialogue and apt idea, with rare command over effect, and the company who amuse us — including such versatile artists as Miss Phyllis Monkman, Miss Dorothy Dickson, Mr. Laurence Ander son, and that charming dancer. Miss Margaret Sande — bring such spirit, verve, and in fectious glee that even the soporific, senti mental ballads which occasionally intersperse only serve to heighten the sharpness of the fare. Above all, the closing scene in sepia is so truly beautiful, so different from the rowdy hurdy-gurdy of the standardised revue, that we come away from an evening well spent with nothing but praise for all those who have contrived for us so fresh and so brilliant an entertainment. At the Prince's, in succession to ' Merrie England,' we ' RUGGLES OF RED GAP,' AT THE PLAZA : CHARLES LAUGHTON AS THE PERFECT VALE1 ' TRANSPLANTED ' TO THE STATES AFTER HAVING BEEN LOST AT POKER. Ruggles. the perfect valet, is lost by his master. Lord Bumstead, at poker to some Americans who think that he would help them to acquire social polish. At Red Gap, in the States, he is passed off as a distinguished English -' ; 'ito r . Colonel Ruggles. In the end, settles dov- 1 . becomes a ' democrat,' and opens a restaurant. Mary Boland plays Effie Floud and Charlie Ruggles is Egbert Floud, who are the American couple who transplant Ruggles. while Mr. Robert Naylor woos with conquering melody and scores with that solo gem, ' I care not if the cup 1 hold.' There is riotous fun while Mr. Joseph Spree as Hassan disports himself with his cavalcade of wives, and Mr. Eddie Carr makes the Sultan Mahmoud a pointed satirist who can give words an edge and topicalities a flair. A little shaping, a little better timing, a little more precision in the movements and grouping, and this comic opera will do full justice to itself and provide a light, bright, attractive show well worth a visit. Turning from the gay, pictorial splendours and light engaging vivacities of the operetta, we find at the Duke of York's all the tension of a trial-scene with Mr. Matheson Lang holding forth as a barrister in ' There Go All of Us.' East Africa provides a background where all the elemental passions are let loose and whisky and morphine are the preludes to murder. But we do not closely analyse the plot which Mr. Hastings Turner has devised, nor the charac ters which he has designed, for Miss Beatrix Thomson exhibits such pathetic helplessness as client that the situa tion holds the stage. A good story, well told, has merits that fill an evening with interest. A problem is set and we are left to find the answer ; a situation is graphically presented, and when that situation crystallises in a court- scene so vividly conducted, we have first-rate enter/'^-^ tainment. Now, at the Comedy, the Anglo-Oriental subject is less happy in its fulfilment, for ' Mrs. Nobby Clark,' who, forsaking her career as a successful actress, comes to live in Burma, comes also into an environment that yields little pleasure. The chief fault lies in the lack of proportion in the three central characters. It is not Mr. Barry Jones's fault that he is not dismissed from the triangle much sooner, for the author's delay undermines the founda tions of sympathy. There is strength and persuasion in Mr. Cecil Parker's obstinate husband; but the quality which redeems the evening is the fine and subtle portrait of Anne. To see the play through the study of Miss Marie Ney is to condone some of its shortcomings. The play is almost defeated by its difficulties, but Miss Ney, overcoming the text, almost succeeds through her imaginative comprehension and sensitive depiction.THE FALSTAFF.

A connecting shackle in the chain had opened and about 150 feet of chain was dragging on the bottom. The weight of the chain was sufficient to hold the vessel in a fixed position during fine v/eather but if a heav^ breeze had come on it would doubtless have drifted ashore in a few hours. There was 90 feet of spare chain and a spare anchor aboard. These were connected t to the chain and the vessel anchored.

MOHAI^MED IBN JUMAH. - SALVAGE CLAIM. r BAHREIN LIGHT VSL. l With reference to your letter No.l/P/22, with regard to the claim put forward by the above man, in respect of the salvage of the Bahrein Light Vessel, when she recently broke adrift. On arrival in Bahrein, I interviewed the Political Agent with regard to the above matter, but owing to his very recent a mva: in Bahrein to relieve Colonel Lock, who has proceeded on leave, and at the same time, there being a new Assistant Political Agent, I was unable to obtain any further information on the subject. The Political Agent suggested sending for the Claimant in order that I might interview the man myself, but as the Claimant is a subject of Quattar, and I was informed that it would take about a week to produce him, I asked the Political Agent to leave the matter over until the next visit to Bahrein, when advice of arrival would be given in good time in order that the man could be present to support his claim. pi my own opinion, and that which is shared by the Political Agent after I had explained matters to him, I consider the claim to be nothing short of a ramp, the claimant having heard that the sum of Rupees 100 was offered some time back for the recovery of the Bahrein Light Buoys when they broke adrift. The Bahrein Light Vessel when found by the L.T.Nearchus was high and dry on a lee shore, and had she remained there lor another twelve hours, she would have been a total wreck,with the severe weather that followed, and no one short of an idiot would have placed the vessel in such a position© Under these circumstances, I consider this claim does not hold water. Laking into consideration that this man claims to have placed the Light Vessel in a ' Safe position' - also that and anoth e r Boatman' towed the Light vessel, notwithstanding 0 £ ac 5 there was 90 feet of heavy chain dragging along the bottom, and which took a considerable amount of work to lift with it being foul of ^ea g^jrv/th and coral.
