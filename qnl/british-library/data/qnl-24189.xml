It was however noticed that of late several consignments consisting of quantities too large to represent the bona fide requirements of the declared destinations in the Persian Gulf were being entered for shipment (the records show that shipping bills for the aggregate quantity of 6525 bales have been put in since 1.9.1943) and that there v/as some likelyhood of their being diverted ultimately to Iraq and Persia. The matter was therefore reported to the Government of India, Department of Commerce, who have now intimated^SPmt pending further instruct- -ions, individual applications may be refused unless the exporter is able to produce a certificate from the Political Agent concerned to the effect that the Cotton is required for local consumption. This procedure has accordingly been intro- -duced here from 1st November 1943 (vide enclosed copy of Notice No. C.444/ETC dated 1.11.1943). CYVfc 2. I am therefore hxiHjajt bringing the matter to your notice with the request that necessary certificates may kindly be issued by you in all cases in which you are satisfied that the quantity of cotton sought to be imported from India is genuinely intended for local consumption. ■&gt; EXPORT TRADE CONTROLLER. | ■' ^ ^ { JTELEPHONE, 19- telegrams 'FAKHROO” DISTRIBUTOR DUNLOP PRODUCTS HERCULES CYCLES CROSLEY RADIOS WILLARD BATTERIES YOUSUF ABDULRAHMAN FAKHROO BAHRAIN.
