Now that the question of status is settled (your telegram No. 1022 ) it is most undesirable that a decision about'THeHouse should be further postponed* If like Government of India the Ministry of Works are unwilling to purchase at present they could ask the Anglo Iranian Oil Company for a lease of Khazalieh House for say 12 months until the question of purchase is decided. In my opinion Willoughby’s objections to the house that the Government of India were about to purchase are well-founded. Alterations would take two or three months and cost a considerable sum. It is therefore unsuitable for leasing whereas Khazalieh is suitable for immediate occupation (see my telegram .No. 1585).

I went into the matter with Dredge during my recent visit and came to the conclusion that there was not really enough work to occupy the full time of two officers, but that the^, amount of routine work was rather heavy for one officer to handle without assistance. In these circumstances what,. I think, is required is a good European or Anglo-Indian Confidential Assistant and the appointment of a second I.P.S. officer appears to me wasteful in the present strained state of the Cadre. The area covered by the Vice-Consulate (or Consulate) is small and there is little touring to be done. 3. I believe Caroe would accept a solution on these lines and I should be glad to know if you would also agree.

I went into the matter with Dredge during my recent visit and came to the conclusion that there was not really enough work to occupy the full time of two officers, but that the vt amount of routine work was rather heavy for one officer to handle without assistance. In these circumstances what,* I think, is required is a good European or Anglo-~ndian Confidential Assistant and the appointment of a second I.P.S. officer appears to me wasteful in the present strained state of the Cadre. The area covered by the Vice-Consulate (or Consulate) is small and there is little touring to be done. 3. I believe Caroe would accept a solution on these lines and I should be glad to know if you would also agree. I could, I think, produce a suitable Anglo-Indian frcm my staff to fill the post of Confidential Assistant and I would not preclude the possibility of his eventually being given the status of Vice Consul should this be found desirable. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Caroe. (Yours sincerely) Sgd/- - Hay. • &gt; Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G. , C.I.E, His Majesty 1 s Minister, Tehran.FC*EIGN OFFICE, S.W.1 23rd May, 1946. 1 .

I have now received a despatch from Colonel Haworth of which copy is enclosed. 2. I refrain from commenting on Colonel Haworth’s res ponse to my request and have the honour to submit my pvxi observations. 3 (a) There is no doubt that Bushire Consulate General exercises complete control over the Vice-Ion sulci te at Bandar Abbas and the Consular \gency at Ling ah. (b) The Consulate at Shiraz keeps Bushire ^informed of most general events of importance and of any special interest and generally works in close relations with it, but it receives all instructions from here. (c) Ahwaz Consulate, to which Mohammereh Vice-Consulate i is subordinate, likewise receives instructions in a generc.l sense from this Legation to which it is directly subordinate, but in April 1925 Sir Denys 3ray(sec asml offioicl-lett 0 v feted. bjXii loi36 ..t i.7 of rotes) , having semi-off ic Lally suggested to Sir F.Loraine that it would be advantageous if ^ Ahwaz and L ohammerah would consult Bushire Consulate General in matters connected with tlie maritime administration of the Gulf, treatment of Indian, dea lings with the Arab littoral and. the 1 ike, th is s ugge s t io n was ref e rred t o H is Ma je s ty f s Co nsu ' Ahwas and has now been put into practiceddcu'-r-^ff ■ o L»,'! 1 iett :rfe-p 9 ui' .

Consul- General at Bushire, who when outside Persia is also Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and H.M. Consul at Khorramshahr. 2. When I arrived, six years ago, Khorramshahr was a Vice-Consulate held by an officer of the Indian Political Department who was subordinate to a Foreign Office Consul at Ahwaz. I was entirely ignorant about the relationship between Bushire and Khorramshahr, but when H.M. Consul at Ahwaz assumed that it was his duty to deal with the question of the construction of a new consulate at Khorramshahr, I found that the finances of Khorramshahr were under Bushire and therefore ruled that it was for H.M. Consul-General at Bushire to see about the proposed building., I did however question Prior’s right to blow into Khorramshahr without notice to Ahwaz. Prior produced a letter from a predecessor of mine dated (I think) 1926, agreeing that the Consul-General at Bushire might visit Khorramshahr when he wished, for the discussion q of matters of common interest. I reminded Prior that a good deal of water had flowed under the Persian bridge since 1926, but said that I should not raise any objection to the practice so long as the war lasted. I suggested however that good official manners required him to send a polite telegram to Ahwaz announcing any forthcoming visit to Khorramshahr and expressing the hope that there would be no objection; where upon he would receive a polite approval. I do not think that Prior agreed with me on this point, though subse 1 uent inquiry showed that my suggestion accorded with his predecessor’s practice; but the point ceased to have any practical import ance because Khorrarashahr was made into an independent consulate for the period of the war. 3. No further difficulty arose until towards the end of 1944 when a complicated ad hoc arrangement was made to employ a former Military Attache, Colonel Underwood, to stimulate the local police in Khuzistan, especially at Abadan, for the immediate and future benefit of the A.I.O.C. Stewart, H.M. Consul at Khorramshahr, came to Tehran to discuss the project with the Embassy and the British Military authorities, and after his return to his post I sent him draft proposals asxing for his views. He demurred to one or two points. He seems to have sent copies of the correspondence to Prior, and I received from Prior a letter criticising the proposals (about whose background he knew nothing) and expressing the view that Stewart had written very raildiy. I returned the letter to Prior with the suggestion that it should be considered as not ^-^having been sent. I received no answer, but when I met Prior not sipng afterwards I spoke of the letter, he said that he had looked up the correspondence and finding that it was not clear g that he had a right to intervene he had decided to ’’pipe down”. .That &gt; C.'.'/.Baxter, Esq.., C.M.G. , M.C.What is now wanted is instructions so clear that neither Prior nor any successor of his will ever pipe up on such an occasion in future. This clinging to the shreds of an authority which may have existed when the Consul-General at Bushire was also Political Resident at Bushire should be abandoned. It is sad to think of a man of the eminence of a First-Class Resident fingering a dog f s eared file of 1926 to see whether it does not perhaps entitle him to protest to the Embassy about Khorramshahr - and coming to a wrong decision. Even our grief at the extinction of the Venetian Republic would diminish if we found a superannuated Doge contracting a questionable marriage with the sea with a 7/oolworth ring. 4* To protect my successors from annoyance and Prior’s successors from placing themselves in a false position through following his unreliable precedents I hereby repudiate anything that any predecessor of mine ever wrote or said, in 1926 or any other year, about the relationship between Bushire and Khorramshahr. I consider that instructions (which need not refer to this letter) should be issued to Bushire and Khorramshahr that their connection is restricted to the functions set forth below. H.M. Consul-General Bushire is responsible for;- fl) Supervision of the accounts of the Khorramshahr Consulate. (2) Arrangements for all subordinate staff of the Khorramshahr Consulate. (3) Recommendations to the Government of India as to cnanges in the career staff at Khorramshahr, in accordance with the practice by which India consult the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the staffing of Indian Political posts in Persia, and the Government of India, having made their selection, ask H.M. Embassy where there is any objection to the proposed appointments. There is no objection to visits to Khorramshahr by H.M. Consul-General at Bushire, but if Khorramshahr is again placed under Ahwaz, as I think it should be, H.M. Consul-General at Bushire should pay H.M. Consul-General at Ahwaz the courtesy of giving him notice and expressing the hope that there is no objection. 5. This difficulty would never have arisen if the plan to transfer the seat of the Political Resident to Bahrain had been carried out. This transfer should be effected without further delay, but I shall deal v/ith that question separately, and officially. 6. I shall also be sending a despatch about the necessity to unite all consular affairs in Khuzistan under H.M. Consul-General at Ahwaz by giving him the supervision (except in the matter of accounts ana staff) over H.M. Consulates at Khorramshahr. 7. I am sending copies of this letter, marked 'Personal and Confidential' to Caroe and Prior.mmt personal * Conf id entia-U A Wm 4w tcrsian Gulf Reaid ency, . ^ Buahire 9 ** r f» 3let January 1946. 9 m \&lt; \ 0 ! ' / My dear Weig^itman, !&lt; ■ J'&amp;l *111 you please refer to Bullard's letter dated October 29, 1945, to Baxter, with copy to Caroe and to me, ' on the relations between Bush ire and Khorramshanr ? 2. The present arrangements were made in 1926, twenty years ago, and have worked very smoothly ever since, with the exception of the brief interlude when King was Consul at Ahwas. The inference is obvious. 5. Bullard has mentioned the matter of Underwood. The reason I raised this point was that in a precisely similar instance where an officer had been appointed with a roving commission in Fare great confusion had been caused until he and his successors were subordinated to the respective consulates. In actual fact the action I had suggested was taken in the case of Underwood so there was nothing inherently wrong in it. If it be held that I exceeded ny functions, I can only say that during trie course of the war I have frequently made suggestions on matters that were not strictly speaking within my purview to many Commanders in Chief, Air Officers Com and ing and Senior Savai Qificers, and that without exception they accepted ny views and thanked me for my trouble. 4. 1 should like to make it clear that I make no claim whatever to control policy at Khorramaharir, nor, so far as 1 am aware, has any Resident done so for twenty years. There are however some matters in which we are vitally concerned and these were summarised in Bray's letter N0.271-N of the 19th April 1926 and the position was accepted by Loraine in his letter of the 25th May 1926 to Monypenny, and that is the position that has been maintained ever since* 5. In*addition to financial and administrative matters I frequently have to refer to Khorramshahr on maritime matters, the mail service (which is under the control of the Governuient of India) piracy, arms traffic, relations with the Arab side, the Kuwait Oil Company, Indians, und Gulf matters generally* There is a very large Indian colony at Khorramahahr and in the past where the Consul has felt the need of advice he has invariably turned to Bush ire for it and I am sure the Government of India would prefer this to continue. 6. As regards Ahwaz, my experience during the war years shows that we have little connection with this post, and that gives force to xiy^oontentions that the matters on which we do have to refer to Khorramshahr are genuinely those affecting the Gulf as a whole. I see it is suggested that I should ask the Consul General at Ahwaz if there is / any•. • • •..

KhorrumohaJnr is a busy port, where apart irom all other considerations, I have many social connect- ions and there seems no reason why any reference to Ahwaz should be required. 7.

In 1943 Khorramshahr hitherto a Vice Consulate staffed by the Government of India, subordinate to the Consulate at Ahwaz^ axgl a Foreign Office post, was raised to the status of Consulate 'Without prejudice to Consular arrangements after the war” • Thus the Khorramshahr post was brought under direct control of Embassy Tehran (329/42)• This arrangement proved unsatisfactory, however, and early the following year it was agreed that in matters affecting Khusistan as a whole ,where representations had to be made to the Governor-General, H.M* Consul Khorramshahr should refer to the Consul-General at Ahwaz ( while continuing to deal direct with the Embassy in matters which involvedthe Central Government Ext. 1208/43)* In June 1943 the post of Consul at Khorramshahr was upgraded to that of a superior post in the Indian Political Service (Pol.1536/45 Political Collection 38/3)* At the end of last year Sir Reader Bullard in his Despatch No.432 recommended that Khorramshahr should again be placed under Ahwaz with regard to political and security matters as soon as British troops were withdrawn. It is not. clear from his Despatch whether he intends that it should revert once more to the status of Vice Consulate (Ert. 1075/46). The Government of India wrote on February 5th forwarding a proposal from the Political Resident that this post should become a permanent Consulate, they themselves recommended that the present arrangements should continue up to 28th February. 1947, pending the re-organisation of the Indian Political Service (Ext. 1122/46). In reply to a telegraphic request for their views on Sir Reader Bullard’s recoramendation^ they stated emphatically that they were not disposed to concur in even the limited proposal to subordinate Khorramshahr to Ahwaz for political and security matters, and pointed out that the interests of Khorramshahr lie mainly in the port and in Abadan where there is the largest single concentration of Indians in Persia, and that in their view these interests require the presence of an officer of at least moderate seniority. They suggest as a compromise, however, that the Consul at Khorramshahr while remaining independent should be • instructed to take up specific matters requiring provincial co-operatian, for example security and tribal questions, through the Consul-General at Ahwaz. Expenditure on the Khorramshahr Consulate is divisible in moieties between H.M.G. and the Government of India, and a draft letter to the Foreign Office requesting their concurrence in the Government of India’s proposal to extend the existing arrangement for a further period of one year is submitted below.Ext. 1122A£ DRAFT LETTER • Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, .... S.W.1. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to correspondence resting with Mr* Peel’s demi-official letter to Mr* Baxter No* Ext. 329/42 of 30th January, 1942, regarding the raising of the status of the Vice Consulate at Khorramshahr (Mohansnerah) to that of Consulate, and to inform you that a reconmendation has been received from the Covemment of India for the continuation of this arrangement for a further period of one year. They con^igLer this proposal justified by the fact that Khorramshahr is now a railhead and has been developed into a large port, through which a great proportion of Persia’s seaborne trade, and also possibly that of Russia, is likely/likely to pass. In addition the vast expansion of the A.I.O.C. in this area necessitates the o « « appointment of an experienced officer able to deal with labour disputes in which Indians may well be involved. The Government of I n dia have in this connection t considered carefully Tehran Despatch No.A32 of 8th December (a copy of which was sent to the India Office under Foreign Office reference K. 22631/22631/234) but did not feel themselves disposed to concur in H.M. Ambassador' s proposal that the Khorramshahr post should be subordinate to that at Ahwaz in political and security matters. The Consul at Khorramshahr deals mainly with maritime questions and with the A.I.O.C. at t Abadan where the largest single concentration of Indians in Persia is to be found, and the Government of India consider that these interests require the presence of an officer of at least moderate/moderate seniority. The incumbent of the Ahw&amp;z post is, of course, a member of the Foreign Service and the Government of India point out that there is the obvious . possibility of embarrassment in their mutual relations if the officer appointed to Khorramshahr were senior in age and relative length of service to the Consul at Ahwaz, but at the same time subordinate to him* On these grounds, therefore, the Government of India recommend that pending the re-organisation of the Indian Political Service, the status of the post at Khorramshahr should continue as that of Consulate until 28th February, 19V7* They would be prepared, however, to agree that the Consul while remaining independent of Ahwaz should be instructed to take up certain specif ie/Aspecifiedmatters requiring provincial co-ordination, for example, security and tribal questions, through the Consul-General at Ahwaz. In view of the reasons adduced by them Lord Pe thick-Lawrence supports the Government of India’s proposal and would be glad to learn whether Mr. Bevin would be prepared to agree.Ev.’r, ]^L£ INWARD^ T/E L W^yjj Allotted to External Dfeptr ! *' d M $ 5714.

'Copy (2227/6/43) To: H.lvi. Principal Foreign Affairs, ' ’ - C^( '■ V ; Jt. A-r*ri BRITISH CONSULATE-^BNER/IL, AHWAZ. 20th June, lyfi-yf | Sjl' V*#*,. &lt;\T ly-tK hAS&amp;L Secretary of State for Foreign Office, London. No.8. With compliments from H.LI.Consul-General, Ahwaz. S^, ^ I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter (No. 1014- 15/7 of 20th May) from Major Chauncy, formerly His Majesty 1 s Consul at Khorramshahr, to my predecessor, recommending that the Consular Shipping Office at Abadan Reach be wholly controlled from Khorramshahr. 2. In effect, the only substantial change that is implied in this proposal is that the Shipping Office accounts should go through and be controlled, by the Consulate at Khorramshahr, instead of through this Consulate-General as at present. In almost all other matters the Shipping Office is, in the nature of things, controlled by H.M.Consul at Khorramshahr, who has the advantage of being within a short distance, and the greater one of having precisely similar question to deal with himself. An argument used in the past in favour of peeping the Shipping Office under the control of Ahwaz was that the Consul or Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr, being, an Indian Political Of*ficer, v/ould not have any knowledge of shipping matters, which should therefore be referred to the Consul, normally a member of the Consular Service, at Ahwaz. Now, however, there is no Consular Official at Ahwaz with any experience of shipping, and the argument ceases to be valid. 3. With regard to the Shipping Office accounts, I consider that these could much better be kept by H.M.Consul at Khorramshahr. The many queries which inevitably arise over accounts have now to be settled either by letter or over the long distance telephone, with considerable waste of time, whereas under the direct control of Khorramshah they would not arise at all. Previously, I understand, such accounts of the Vice-Consulate at Khorramshahr used also to come through this office: now, however, Khorramshahr submits accounts direct to the Foreign Office, and the Shipping Office accounts could easily be included in these. An /additional Sir Reader W. Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E. His.Britannic Majesty 1 s Minister, etc., etc. , etc. , British Legation, Tehran. /additional advantage would arise in that Khorramshahr regularly has a large credit balance in local currency which would to some extent defraj/- the expenses of the Shipping Office, and thus cut down traffic in sterling bills. 4. I have the honour to recommend, therefore, that * the Consular Shipping Office at Abadan Reach be placed under the control of H.M.Consul at Khorramshahr in all respects, including accounts. If this proposal is approved H.II.Consul will require a supply of Foreign Office bills of exchange, but I understand he has all other necessary documents. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the • Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, (Despatch No.8) and H.M. Consul Khorramshahr. I have, etc., (Signed) A.C.GALLOWAY H.M.

J y &amp;, Jn 4 \ My dear Macann, With reference to our conversation regarding the control of the Abadan Reach Consular Shipping &gt; Office I discussed the question v/ith Mr. Holman in Tehran and he seemed agreeable to the suggestion that it should be wholly controlled now from Khorramshahr and not from Ahwaz provided you were in agreement. As I understand you to be of the same opinion I should be grateful if you would kindly write to the Legation and Foreign Office asking for this to be arranged. The only indent I have to make is for a book of Foreign Office Bills of Exchange to be able to draw funds on the Imperial Bank of Persia# Khorramshahr. The accounts of the Abadan Reach Consular Shipping Office would then be incorporated in the Foreign Office Accounts of the Khorramshahr Consulate. Yours sincerely, (Signed) F.C.L. Chauncy. Lt.Col.

Please see the submission on Ext.329/42. We have now learned orally from the Foreign Office that they have obtained Treasury sanction for the upgrading of the Mohammerah Vice Consulate to the status of a Consulate; and that they agree to the appointment of Captain Chauncy to the new post. Meanwhile we have received the Government of India*s telegram No.1185 of February 17th pressing for a decision and pointing out that they are keeping Captain Chauncy ready to move at short notice, which affects various postings. It therefore seems desirable to reply to the Government of India without waiting to receive a letter from the Foreign Office. The Government of India will presumably submit in due course proposals for the allowances to be attached to the post of Consul( which is d ivisible equally between Imperial and Indian Revenuesi The additional cost! involved will be equivalent to the difference between the salary and allowances of a Consul and those of the Assistant to the Vice Consul (which post will be abolished). The Assistent to the Vice Consul drew pay on the time scale of the Indian Political Service, special pay of Rs. 200 a month. Customs Compensatory Allowance of Rs.100 a month, and house rent allowance of Rs.100 a month. It therefore appears te that the extra cost of the present proposal should not be very considerable. It will , probably exceed tne limit of £100 a year which, under existing arrangements, either H.M.G. or the Government of India may sanction without reference to the other; but it will be well within the £1,000 per annum to which it is now proposed to raise this limit. 5^ Ca-^-c, Uji, —&gt; fcjt- -•^9. c^LCcfaCU. £ A draft telegram is submitted, informing the Government of India that the proposal is approved.

R.A.McConaghey + (The 2 officers whose names are starred were appointed last Autumn in accordance with proposals made by the Government of India for the attachment of additional staff to various Consulates in South and East Persia. Previously the post of Vice-Consul at Ahwaz had been in abeyance, and there had been no assistant to the Vice- Consul at Mohammerah.) 3. The first paragraph of Tehran telegram No.85 refers to an incident which took place in 1940 - see the papers between P.Z.6475/40 and 6861/40 (flagged). It seems somewhat unfair of Sir R.Bullard to bring this incident up, since - (a) The proposal in 1940 was that the Consul at Ahwaz should move his Headquarters to Nohammerah. The Government of India’s objections to that proposal do not apply in the present case, where it is contemplated that there should be a full Consul at each post. (b) A large part of the Government of India’s objection in 1940arose from the fact that the transfer was carried through without their being consulted. On their protestor Sir R.Bullard apologised and the status quo was restored. 4. As regards/^staffing of the new post, the Government of India suggest that Captain F.C.L. Chauncy should be appointed Consul. Captain Chauncy has had some 12 years’ experience in the Indian Political Service, and served as Vice-Consul at Mohammerah from November 1932 to (apparently) some time in 1935. In a personal telegram the Government of India draw attention to some papers* which *« , show that in 1935 the Foreign Office and the Anglo-Tfernian Oil Company pressed unsuccessfully that he should be kept on at Mohammerah. 5. The Government of India propose that Captain Dredge should continue as Vice-Consul under the new Consul, but that the post of Assistant to the Vice-Consul should be abolished. 6. The ces£ of the new post will, of course, be divisible between Imperial and Indian Revenues and no financial question seems to arise, at all events at the present stage.^ ^ ^ tJu * ^ Jr ^ S(hjc , co%ju, drawing attention to the Government of India’s official telegram u* ' I'V/ 7.

V ^ I 3 0 J4IV 1942 Dear Baxter, Will you please refer to the Government oi India’s telegram No.536 dated January 21st (further copy enclosed) regarding the proposal to raise the Vice-Consulate at Nohammerah to the status of a Consulate. You will see that the Government of India welcome this proposal, as put forward in Tehran telegram No.85 of January 18th^ and that they can at once make available Captain F.q.L. Chauncy a.or the new post. '. : e cannot trace the Bushire despatch to which they refer; it is quite probable that no copy was sent home^ and that the Government o± j.nciia reference to i^ is for the benefit o± iiiK Bushire and Tehran^to whom their telegram was repeated. In a personal telegram, however. Caroe has drawn attention to a note, of which I enclose a copy^ ojp a telephone conversation which Laithwaite had with Oliphant on March 19th, 1935. This note shows that/that during his period of service as Vice-Consul at I.Iohammerah, Captain °hauncy earned very high opinions from the Foreign Office, the Minister at Tehran, the Senior Naval Officer, e4^the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In the light of this note it v.ould seem that Captain Chauncy could safely be accepted as an ’'official of suitable seniority” for the post, in accordance with condition (1) laid down by Bullard in his telegram No.35.

In view of the present financial stringency, it has not been possible to accept the Hon'ble the Resident's proposal to raise the status of the post of Head olerk at Kuwait* Although the net average additional expenditure amounts to less than £100 per annum, the extra expenditure involved in the Kuwait Agency taken by itself exceeds £100 per annum which is beyond the limit up to which the Government of India are empowered to sanction divisible expenditure in anyone Consulate.

Clerical Establishment of the Political Agent, Kuwait. I have the honour to recommend (i) that the Head Clerkship of the Kuwait Agency should, in future, be a Special Grade appointment, (ii) that a post of Second Clerk of the Kuwait Agency should be created, and (iii) that the Head Clerkship of the Vice- Consulate at Mohammerah reduced from the status of a Special Grade appointment and should in future be held by an Upper Divisio n Clerk. 2. A proposition statement showing the effect of these recommendations is enclosed, from which it will be seen that a net average annual increase of expenditure of Rs.2,640/- is involved. 3. The Hon* ble Lieut-Colonel Powle made a personal inspection of the Kuwait Office before he proceeded on leave and instructed me to explain that the proposals now made are submitted at his direction and with his full support. The proposed arrangements are, he is convinced, imperatively necessary to free the Political Agent from routine confidential work to ^enable him to fulfil V is own duties without hindrance and to prevent the English Office of the Kuwait Agency from breaking down. A breakdown has only been staved off by the fact that Mrs. Dickson has assisted in the more confidential work (a time-honoured but indefensible method of keeping Offices in the Persian Gulf from collapse) and recently by temporarily deputing an experienced clerk from the ResidencyResidency Office. Neither of these expedients can be continued. 4. A statement is enclosed showing the receipts and issues from the Kuwait agency Office for the last decade, but statistics give little real information about the state of affairs, and I wish to place before the Govern ment of India certain more general considerations. The position in Kuwait has completely changed in the past few years. The activities of its neighbours ^a*udi Arabia and ’Iraq, the opening up of communications with the outside world by motor and by air, and the competition for oil both in X and around Kuwait,' have overthrown the former isolation and Bedouin character of the place. As specific questions, the date garden disputes, the Sa’udi Blockade and continual incidents over smuggling and shipping, may be mentioned as typical of the trouble*- seme matters which arise. Moreover, Kuwait is a most valuable centre for obtaining desert information, but the Political Agent must be free to see visitors if he is properly to fulfil this role . I would only exphasize that the Arab regards haste as unseemly, and without time it is impossible either to do business with him, or to get information from him. 5. At present the clerical establishment of the Kuwait Agency consists of a Head Clerk from the Upper Division, a Munshi from the Upper Division and a non-pensionable Passport Clerk. The Head Clerk does all the non-confidential work of the office, keeps the accounts, supervises Launch and other establishments and stores. He has himself to keep inward and outward registers and to do his own despatching work. The Munshi is fully occupied and, though the Passport Clerk assists the Head Clerk so far as is possible, he has little time available and it is unsuitable that much should be left to a clerk of his status. Un*rr.E Under tbs present proposals, the Kead Clerk will act as the Political Agent’s confidential cl^rk and typist, will register all confidential letters, prepare secret returns and file confidential papers, thus freeing the Political Agent for his legitimate duties. He will also exercise general supervision over the office. The Second Clerk will be entrusted with the accounts (under the supervision of the lead Clerk) and non- confidential work of the office. The Munshi and Passport Clerk will continue to attend to the work which they are now doing. 6. The average cost of these proposals amounts to Ss 11,808/- a year i.e. an average annual increase of Rs. 3,960 over the present average cost. In view of the need for economy, it is proposed that the post of Head Clerk at Mohammerah shall cease to be a Special Grade Appointment and that the incumbent shall be a clerk of the Upper Division. This will effect an average saving of Rs 1,320 a year. I cannot pretend that this reduction in the grade of the Head Clerk at Motammerah is desirable, but I am anxious at the present juncture to do all that is possible to avoid asking Government to face any extra expenditure that can be avoided. Taking this reduction into consideration the changes proposed involve a net average increase of Rs 2,640/- per annum. 7. In view of the overworked state of the Kuwait Agency Office and of the fact y that it has been necessary to refuse permission to Lieut-^olonel Dickson, though his health is bad, to go on leave or even to enjoy recess, I beg that the proposals may be sanctioned with effect from the 1st November 1933. I am prepared to find the sum required to meet the additional cost in the current year, 1933-34, by re-appropriation. 8.8. Finally, X would beg the Government of India, in considering these proposals, to bear i . mmu a new lactor which affects proposals of this nature. We are no longer dealing with the Bedouin Ruler, the adventurer type of foreign Consul, and the old fashioned pioneering firms of the past. We are now compelled to deal with jiulers, who have adopted, to a greater or less extent, a civilised diplomacy, great oil companies, and international air and other interests, and it is essential, therefore, to provi our Agencies in the Persian Bulf with competent and sufficient office establishments.i'roik * The A&amp;CL1 .Deputy Secretary to the Govt, of India in the foreign and Political Departmentt To * The Kon’hle the Political Beaiaent in the Persian GulT.

This amount will appear in the Indian statement of expenditure, and will be adjusted with your Department in the ordinary course. 2. It would appear from the first paragraph of your letter of the 27th January, No. K 1062/1062/234, that Mr. Jakins has also been paid from Foreign Office funds in respect of this period the sterling emoluments to which he was entitled as an officer of the Levant Consular Service. The Government of India have/have accordingly requested, on the assumption that it is not intended that Mr. Jakins should retain these emoluments in addition to those paid to him as Vice-Consul, Mohammerah, that steps should be taken to effect recovery from him of the amount paid in excess, and that the requisite adjustment may be made in the accounts between this Office and your Department. 3. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare would therefore be glad if the necessary action might be taken to recover the excess from Mr. Jakins, and to credit the amount so recovered in the annual statement of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure rendered to this Office.

I am to observe that one half of these charges will be recoverable from the Government of India in the usual annual adjustment of joint expenditure in Persia and that the Foreign Office will not require, as would seem to be stated in the draft letter enclosed with India Office letter under reference, the refund of the whole amount. 3. Sir John Simon agrees, however that the total amount of the emoluments received by this officer should be fixed at what the Government of India considers an appropriate figure, and I am therefore to propose that one half of any such emoluments in excess of the amounts indicated in paragraph 1 above, should be recoverable by the Government of India from this department in the annual adjustment of joint The Under Secretary of State, India Office.4. It is assumed from the first paragraph of your letter that, during the absence on leave of Dr. Lincoln, his pay will not be charged in the annual adjustment, and I am to enquire whether this assumption is correct.

I do not know where the copy of the Government of India’s letter to the Political Resident dated the 3rd October 1931 came from, hut evidently it was not enclosed with our letter P.Z. 6775/31 to the Foreign Office, or if it was the Foreign Office overlooked it. I do no Understand the Foreign Office reference to a proposal to grant Rs.650 allowances to hr, Jakins. The only proposal made appears to he that of the Political Resident to grant allowances totalling Rs.675,^which is what the Government of India have actually granted^ There seem to me to he two questions for consideration. The first is what authority has the power to fix Ilr.Jakins’ psy* The Government of India evidently think they have, and having regard to Rule 1(9) of the Central Audit Resolution, it seems to me that they are right. This reads as follows:- The o^rovT^Pon° 1 sanction of the Secretary of State in Council is necessary x x x x x (9) to any expenditure ©“f J iplomatic and insular Xervices in Persia, except in the following cases:~ ( i) g^irVhtv X expenditure salaries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at any one hoa-4 • x There seems to he no question(from one point of view at any rate/of ShrScr expenditure here. The second question,^if it falls to he in this Office considered at all^ is what pay and allowances Mr.Jakins ought to have. I think that the view of the Political Resident that there is no case for granting him exactly the sane as his Indian service predecessor // \ e °V ^ he i8 given his tasio pay in the Levant Consular Service plus the allowances which his predecessor drew,^which it will he noted are not only conpensatory hut include P.s.300 special pay^ I cannot see that he would have any grounds for complaint. But he has in fact received Re.95 a month more than this, and I do no^ see how it would he possible, even if the Secretary of State’s sanction were required under rule, to recover anything from Mr.Jakins (who, I suppose,^ finished his service in the post some months ago). not a mere mistake on the part of the accounts authorities, hut a deliberate decision of the Govern- ment of India. If the above views are accepted, the only action that seems to he called for is to ask the Government of India to make the purely accounting adjustments referred to in the first part of paragraph 2 of the draft letter^ so as to secure compliance with the provisions of the Superannuation Act. I presume that one half the expenditure is borne by the Foreign Office, hut if the view at &amp; above is correct, it would seem that they have no alternative tut to accept the charge without question, see the Minute on F.4287/28. ~i • vi.• Ir ! an y father communication on this subject, please quote ^ No. K 12534/1638/234. and address, n °t to any person by name. but to- Or* “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. i.

It will te seen that Mr. Lascelles does not share my view that Mr. Jakins* emoluments should be decided in accordance with the principle that by going to Mohammerah he should not be a loser. He holds the opinion that ir* Jakins should receive the same sum in pay and allowances as Ir* Lincoln, or what the latter would have received had he been of the same seniority as Jlr. Jakins* A Mr. Jakins, it appears, will be content with the pay and allowances of Mr. Lincoln. 3. In face of the expressed opinions of ir. Lascelles, I do not wish to persist in my view that Mr. Jakins* . ■ pay should be based on what he would receive, were the Vice-Consul, Mohammerah, a Levant Service appointment. Lore over, the cal aula tion of his pay on this hypothesis ENCLOSURfro'tild present certain difficulties. In appointments under INDIA FOREIGN SEC 0 ''’’'^ I tl^.Jjioreign Office, an important element of the salary is ■ Utter Dated Rqc i • 3 8 OCTtl&amp;l 'cost of living bonus', which varies with the prices OCT 195^ of staple coimaodo tie s at each post.

Hr. Lincoln, as Vice-Consul .^ohammerah, received a monthly pay of Rs. 720, vhich is approximately Re. 16 5 6. Aiohararae rah is notoriously expensive. it boasts a large English Community, and, as Senior British represent ative, the Vice Consul is expected to entertain on a to the post have been filled in consideration of these facts, and are in consequence more generous than elsewnere in the Gulf. 7. The pay of Levant Consular Officers is admittedly low conditions obtaining at Mohammerah were taken into account when determine *the allowances, I do not agree with Mr. ie see lie s that Mr. Jakins should also receive from Total £ 500 or £ 41.6.0. per mensem equal to Rs. 555-8-0. It is not known whether he will receive a 'cost more than what Mr. Jakins is drawing.

The only equitable principle on which to base the calculation of these emoluments would appear to me to be that as long as Mr. Jakins performs the functions normally performed by an officer serving directly under the Government of India he Should receive the same sim that the Government of India paid his predecessor, or would have paid his predecessor had he been of the same seniority as Mr# Jakins in Government Service. I am unaware what basic salary,Apart from the allowances which you enumerate in the third paragraph of your despatch, would be drawn by an officer of equal seniority to Mr. Jakine but serving directly under the Government of India. Mir. Jakins* basic salary is, I believe, four hundred and twenty pounds sterling a year during the present year of his service, though I cannot guarantee that figure. He would also Yrra normally draw a representation allowance of one hundred and fity pounds sterling while serving in Persia, plus a small cost-of-lving bonus not yet fixed for the past financial year and a local allowance of fifty pounds sterling if he were posted to Re sht or Hamadan, the two independent Levant service Vice Consular posts in Persia. Which, if any, of these allowances he continues to draw from the Foreign Office over and above his basic silary while he serves at Mohammerah, I am unable, to my regre to sayk and I would suggest that an enquiry might be jg r Jp addressed to him direct on the subject.August 14 th 1931. Dear Bradshaw* tfany thanks for the opportunity of expressing my views as to my emoluments while acting at j n ha nine rah • As you i mZ f doubtless know emoluments paid by the Foreign Office very ■ ' —p-r- from po sii to post and as Moha mme rah is not under London the rates f o r a Levant Officer here have never been fixed. Consequently I came here on a basic £ 400/- a year plus £100/- representation allowance and on this no addition has b«en made in respect of cost of living. So that while if a Government of India Officer were here the suggestion that the difference in allowances only should be paid might be equitable I feel that to do this in my case would be a manifest injustice. First of all* because it is a Foreign Office practice that Officers acting in posts other than their own get the difference( if any) in salary. Secondly* that I wa s brought at great inconvenience and i risk to my health(I was supposed to be recuperating in .Meshed) from one extreme corner to the opposite extreme corner of Persia entirely to help the Government of India out of a difficulty. Thirdly that in view of its proximity to Abadan and its Geographical position this is the most expensive as well as climatically one of the worst posts in Persia and the emoluments which I am drawing at the moment are not adjusted on the^e bases. I trust therefore that in order that I may suffer no hardship from filling the post at Mohammerah in the present emergency you will induce the Government of India to pay the difference between my present emoluments and those of the substantive holder of this post namely*- * Rs. 1*395 or @ 13.5 £ 103.33 minus l/l£th of £ 500 or £ 41.67 i.e. £ 61.66 or 832.5 Rs. a mo nth.t A ,'T Ho. 215.

The actual date of the former's arrival at his post will be reported to you in due coxurse. 2 .

Sir Lancelot Olipiiant rang me up yesterday to say that he had received strong representations from the A.P.O.C*, which were hacked hy the Consular Department of the Foreign Office, in favour of the retention for a further period of Captain F.C.L. Chauncy, of the Political Department, as Vice-Consul, Mohacmerah. The A.P.O*C. spoke in the highest terms of the tact and skill with which Captain Chauncy had discharged his duties and the S.N.O. was understood to entertain an equally high opinion of him. Sir Lancelot Oliphant enquired whether in these circumstances there would he any possibility of securing a further extension. 2* I said that, while this was essentially a matter for the Government of India, Sir Lancelot oliphant would remember that Captain Chauncy had already had one extension at the express request of the Minister and that it was perhaps unlikely, if he was to finish his training in India, that they would wish to grant a further extension. It might well not he in Captain Chauncy*s own interests. Sir Lancelot Oliphant explained the position to the A.P.O.C. representatives, who were actually with him, and said that in the circumstances both he and they realised that there might he objections to a further extension, hut that, in view of the importance of this post and of the personal element in it, it would he very greatly appreciated if the Government of India could endeavour to replace Captain Chauncy hy someone/</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00007c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3562</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00007c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3562</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/6 'Mohammerah and Khorramshahr: vice consulate and consulate appointments'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-20T22:01:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (232 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 233; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns appointments at the Vice-Consulate (later Consulate) at Mohammerah [Khorramshahr, Iran].The file covers:emoluments of H G Jakins as Vice Consul of Mohammerah in 1932appointment of F C L Chauncy as Vice Consul of Mohammerah in 1932clerical posts at the Kuwait Political Agency and at the Vice-Consulate in MohammerahNorwegian consular representation at Abadanappointment of Allen Lancelot Austin Dredge as Vice-Consul of Mohammerah in 1941proposed opening of a Consulate at Mohammerah and reducing of Ahwaz to a Vice-Consulateappointment of F C L Chauncy as Consul of Mohammerah in 1942appointment of R A McConaghey as Acting Consul of Mohammerah in 1943appointment of R H Cook as Acting Consul of Mohammerah in 1944relations between Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, at Bushire, and Consulate at Khorramshahrappointment of V W D Willoughby as Consul of Mohammerah in 1948.The file is composed of correspondence between the Foreign Office; the India Office; the Government of India; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Viceroy; the Secretary of State for India; the British Consulates at Ahwaz, and Mohammerah; British Petroleum; the Royal Norwegian Legation to London; the British Minister at Tehran.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Norwegian Legation to London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Petroleum Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Passport Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM High Commissioner to India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Ahwaz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mohammerah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><subject><topic>British</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00007c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
