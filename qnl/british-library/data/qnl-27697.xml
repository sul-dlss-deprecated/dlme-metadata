Though this report is unilateral and not autnoritative, it is of considerable interest as being Irom an ol ficer with knowledge both of Kuwait and Iraq. k ihc issue ol the above has been authorised. iid. Joint Secretary to the Government of md Joint Secretary to the Government of India',1 u)gatio :: Ui? 1 'rii^ prjpo^jd port at uh QAgR&gt; The proposition is to establish the position of the proposed port at um C^asr m relation to the Koweiti-iraqi frontier which has been defined rou^'nly but not demarcated on the ground. 2. Trie section of the frontier which is relevant to the proposition 13 that between safwan tmd the hhor Abdulla* The definition, made by sir Cox, states that the frontier should pass just south of bafwan to the junction of the Khor Zobier and the 1thor Abdulla. 1 am not m possession of the words oi the actual definition, but have been provided with tne Iraqi Government’s proposal of 193U, which is based on the above definition. This states -just south ol the latitude oi bAFV/Ail s thence Eastwards passing south of GAb'WAN WiCLIiS, JGBhJO bJAilAM and UU O w ASR, leaving then to Iraq, and so on to the junction of the KHOR ZOBRiR witli the KHOR ABBULhA”. Bven if this wording is not identical with the above-mentioned definition made by air P*Z. Cox, the essential points are the same, that the frontier m this area 13 a line from just south 01 oaf wan to the junction of tile Khor Zobier and the Khor Abdulla. it is therefore necessary to decide upon the location of ^x) 'just** south of Safwan, and (y) the junction of the two Khor 3 . 3* As regards x, it has, to the best of my recollection, been agreed by both the Iraqi and Koweiti authorities, that tixis point should be taken as one mile south ol Safwan, and I think any boundary commission will m all probability accept tne one mile proposal, so that point may be accepted, i.e. one mile south of aafwun post. Kven should this not be accepted, but bafwan Post itself selected as the frontier mark, it will not affect the xiresent proposition, as a glance at the map v/m show. As regards y, in locating this point, the naming to be found on the various maps of the- 2 - r\ tiie region cannot oe taken ao a guide, for different names are t ound to indicate the same plaoe on different maps. V/e tiierefore cannot rely on naps for evidence m this matter, and as we do not know the point that was m sir p.Z. Cox’s mind, we must investigate possible positions of the junction. The arguments for possible positions follow, and show that there are two logical positions. 4. There are lour possiole positions of the junction A. Opposite the urn ^asr Creek h* To tne ^ast of Ware a isianc hot tne Khor £obeir. /*&gt; C. * Where the hhor baoiyaii joins tne haot-Weot channel. 1). The confluence of the Khor which flows Korth-Soutn with that which flov/s hast-V/est. A. In my opinion, the logical meaning of the term Khor gooier is that Khor which flows roughly north-south the mouth of which lies roughly between pillars K cUid L on the attached map, that is to say* where the main orth-South cxiannel is met by the Kast-West charinel. Any o tiler reading based on information from maps would be hard to defend, for although the term Khor Abdulla is found on some maps to indicate the southern reach of the Khor £obier, tills cannot be correct, lor on these selfsame i:iaps the wording KLor 3hai tana is found for the northern arm of the Khor Abdulla at the b it urcation at War Da isianc., and the Khor bubiyan lor the southern arm, this would indicate that the Khor Abdulla terminates hast of Warba. Again, the southern reach of trie Khor Zobier to the Yiest of Hecham island is known as the urn (^asr ?ieaon and to the hast as the Khor Hecham. There are, there! ore, no grounds for establishing the t-ermination of the Khor Abaulla north of hecham. d. it would oe illogical to assume that the Khor Abdulla terminates to the hast of V/arba Island on the grounds that on maps the terms Khor Shai tana arid Khor Bubiyan are used.These are mere reaches of the main stream. if this is not ta-&lt;en to oe the case, the hhor Abdulla and the hhor Z^obier do not' meet. The only logical meaning of the term hhor Abdulla is that hhor which flows from the sea to the main land westward. G. A possible solution for the position of the mouth of the Khor £obier is where the hhor Sabiyah meets the main channel. it is not necessary nere to discuss this possibility, for even were it selected by a frontier commission as the junction of the hhor Zooier and hhor Abdulla, the frontier drawn from that point to aafwan would pass to the south of the site of the proposed port. D. Having shewn that the hhor which flows Horth-South is to be regarded as the Khor Zobier, and the hhor which flows ulast-West the hhor Abdulla, the junction is where these two waters meet, that is to say, somewhere near the intersection of the lines hN and uM on the attached map. b. The location of the points x and y having been decided upon, it remains to plot them on to maps to find the solution of the problem. The site of the proposed port will not extend more than 5,500 feet to the south from pillar J?‘. The map has been prepared by the base burvey bection. 6. There are no local terms which can be taken as a guide for m this barren region there are no inhabitants. i have made both ground and air reconnaissances of the area and having come to the conclusions set forth above I am of the opinion that the site of the proposed port of um Qasr is in irat^. bd.fl ,C.Galloway.CONFIDENTIAL. */ /j No. c/525 of 1941. «V/// receipt belted The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Political Agent, Kuwait, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned document(s). fa British Consulate-General, BU8HIRE.

Little emerges from a study of these documents beyond the fact that they and Lorimer are mutually contradictory and that all the maps differ in important details from each other and from the most recent Admiralty chart No.1265. This chart is not available in External Affairs Department but could be obtained from Defence Department. 2. In the circumstances I think that there is no object in recording a note upon Um Q,asr port in the light of Lorimer page 1503 and 1504 and the documents quoted in the footnote to page 1503 and ^ there appears to be nothing to do but await the authoritative map for which we have pressed.

His Majesty^ Embassy transmits herewith to Force Headquarters a copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enquiring whether the General Officer Commanding, Iraq, would be able to arrange for the preparation of a reliable map of the frontier zone between Iraq and Koweit, indicating, if possible the line of the frontier on the basis of the 1940 formula, and also the area to be covered by the installations and approaches of Um Qasr Port. 2. In his note No.487 of the 7th October, 1940, a copy of which is enclosed, Sir Basil Newton communicated the above-mentioned formula to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the guidance of the Demarcation Commission which His Majesty’s Government desired the Iraqi and Koweiti Governments to set up. The formula was adopted by His Majesty’s Government at that date as a suitable interpretation of the existing frontier definition contained in the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ note No.2944 of the 21at July, 1932, a copy of which is also enclosed. This interpretation was approved in principle by the Ruler of Koweit before it was communicated to the Iraqi Government. 3. The Embassy would be glad to learn urgently whether Force Headquarters can arrange for the preparation of the map desired and, if so, how soon it would be available for transmission to the Foreign Office. The Embassy would be grateful if it might receive nine copies of this map when completed. 4.

To The Hon’hle the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with your Printed Letter No. C/491, dated November 2nd, 1941, and to enclose a note on the Safwan-Umm ^asr Section of the Kuwait-Irag Frontier. 2. * The definition giwen in paragraph 18 of the note is, I suggest, the only true interpretation of the relevant portion of the Green Line. If this interpreta tion is accepted by His Majesty’s Government, the expanded definition of 1940 (Annexure, Serial No. IX) will have to be abandoned, or at least modified to a substantial degree. Only thus will it be possible to secure for Kuwait, when the Kuwait-Iraq. frontier is demarcated, tne recognition of rights whose maintenance and preservation are an obligation, self-assumed yet sacred, of the British Government. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major Political Agent, Kuwait/ 3 . /*v F* tr^ Note oX the Safwan-Khor Abdullah section of the Kuwait - Iraq Frontier, November 1941♦ ###***# !• ^'he Northern boundary of Kuwait has been an object of discussion, and often of dispute, for forty years, and no one, without compelling reasons, would be justified in adding to the volume of literature, already considerable, which has grown up around the subject# but there is, at the present moment, imminent danger of steps being taken which would result in the loss to H.H. the Shaikh of Kuwait of valuable territorial rights - rights, moreover, which His Majesty^ Government are pledged to protect; and it is, therefore, of importance that there should be no misapprehension in regard to the nature and extent of those rights if they are to become the subject of further negotiations with the Iraq Government. 2# The latest definition of the Northern boundary of Kuwait is contaix.ed in letter Uo.487, dated 7th October 1940 from His Majesty's Ambassador at b a gdad to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Iraq Government - vide serial No.IX in the Aiinexure to this note# That definition purports to be, and is propounded as, an interpretation of the defini tion accented both by the Iraq Government and H.H#the 33 On h Shaikh of Kuwait in 1932 (vide aerial No.VIII annexure). The definition of 1932 is identical with the definition agreed to in 1923 by the High Commissioner for Iraq (Sir /&gt;i2-r * erc y Cox ) an &lt;i H *H. the Shaikh of Kuwait (vide serial No. puli VII Annexure). And the definition of 1923 was specifically stated by Sir Percy Cox to be “identical with the frontier fun) indicated by the Green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of July 29th, 1913“.3. It would thus be llgical to expect that the expanded definition of the boundary line proposed to the Ira^ Government in October, 1940, would correspond exactly with the frontier indicated by the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkish -agreement of 1913* Unfortunately there is no such exact correspondence; anu., still more unfortunately, the divergence occurs at the very point (i*e, in the vicinity of Urn ^asr) where exact correspondence would, in present circumstances, be most welcome• will readily be seen where the divergence occurs. In the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish agreement the Green Line runs E.S.h. Irom Safwan to Um *4asr, and thence S,E. following, apparently, the line of the Khor. it is here relevant to bring to notice a number of errors in the drawing of the map. (a) The line denoting the Eastern bank of Khor Zubair becomes, oelow Um ^asr, the western bank of the ^hor at Zubiyeh; which is absurd, (b) i^y a complementary error the shading to indicate water is, below Um ^asr, misplaced. (c) The Green Line below Um ^asr does not merely join the hed Line,but extends beyond it; this also is absurd. But these cartographical errors, however much they mat add to the difficulties inherent in detailed interpretation of the Green Line, do not affect the simple fact that the Green Line does, south of Um ^asr, take a direction different from that which it takes between Safwan and Urn ^asr. Whereas, in the inter pretation suggested to the Iraq Government in 1940, the boundary is -in a straight line from the neighbourhood of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah-• 5. A report prepared recently by Lieut .-Colonel Galloway indicates that the eite of the projected port at Um waer winiT IHr -3- if the expanded definition of 1940 is applied when the boundary is demarcated, fall within Iraq territory. On the other hand, if the implications of the Green Line are accepted and applied when the boundary is demarcated, the site of the port will fall mainly, and perhaps exclusiyely, within Kuwait territory. The issues involved in the inter pretation of the boundary as defined in the ^rtglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913 are, therefore, of weighty significance alike to Iraq and Kuwait; and it will be necessary, in order to appreciate the position fully, to scrutinise the origins both of the expended definition of 1940 and of the Green L ine it self . 6* The expanded definition of 1940 has a comparatively brief history. In 1935, in connection with the delineation on Survey of India maps of the Kuwait - Iraq frontier, Colonel Dickson then Political Agent, Kuwait,reported that the boundary ran 'in a straight line' from a point one mile to the south , .

Persian of Safwan wells ’) to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah; and he suggested that the boundary should thus be traced on the Survey of India maps. is Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, to whom Colonel Dickson’s suggestion was referred, deplored a 'unilateral A To Paragraphs 6 and 7 of Jespatch Ko.578(377/~T interpretation' 9/35 dated 30th October 1935 from H ” * I u Z Ambassador, Bagdad, to the Foreign raT377/~T »M • ’ s Office.) of the inter national documents in which the frontier was laid down, and expressed the view that, as the agreed frontier between Iraq and Kuwait was intended to be identical with the Green Line of the Anglo-Turjcish Agreement of 1913, that Line 'should be most carefully reproduced' in all official maps on which / the-4- /~\ Majesty’s Government did not accent this view; and, in regard to that portion of the frontier which forms the subject of this note, they made the following observations Paragraph 6 of Despatch -Wo*43 ^7061/127/) •From Safwan to , 91 dated 22nd January 1936 from Foreign ) Office to H.M.’a ambassador, Bagdad. ) the Persian Gulf, His Majesty’s Government see no reason to dissent from the frontier line which the Political Agent at Kuwait has indicat ed as being locally accepted, namely, a straight line from a point one mile south of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah This line should be drawn straight from a point a mile south of bafwan to the tri-junction of the Khor Zubair, the Khor Shetana and the Khor as Subiya, since this point represents as nearly as possible the junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah. Careful examination of the results of the recent survey do not suggest to Hie Majesty's Government that any material point can be involved 1 *. Delineation of the boundary on Survey of India maps was subsequently wade in accordance with this interpretation which was not, at the time, referred either to the Iraq Government or to the Shaikh of Kuwait for their assent. 7. A proposal to demarcate the Kuwait - Iraq boundary brought this complex question once again into prominence; and, in June 1940, the assent of the Shaikh of Kuwait was sought to the expanded definition of the boundary to which reference has already been made (vide serial Ko.IlC Annexure). The expanded definition of the boundary was described to H.H. the Shaikh as being 'only a clarification of the exist- ing definition'; and on this understand^i.e. on the under standing that no change in the status quo was involved, the ./ Shaikh-5- Shaikh gave his formal assent to the new definition. The expanded definition has also been proposed to the Iraq Govern ment as a basis for the interpretation of the agreed defini- T7 Letter ?Io.487 of T7lQ.AQ J' tion o£ the , rimoassaaor at bagdad to the Iraqi ) / ^ Minister i or foreign iU'lairs. | agreed definition 2.

Telegram dated 29th March 1941 from H. M•* s Ambassador at Bagdad to Foreign Office. Annexure). But that Government, anxious to defer demarcation of the boundary, lias so far given no indication of its views in regard to the expanded definition proposed to it. 8. Critical examination of the history of the expanded definition of 1940 prompts a number of observations which may possibly be of use in assessing the validity of that defini tion as a basis for future negotiations :- (a) When Colonel Dickson prpposed the substitution of a straight line for the angular line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement he imagined that his straight line would pass much closer to Um ^asr than it actually does. For he specifically states in his letter oi 27th August 1935 that rt the whole line thus drawn leaves each of the points known as Jabal Sanaa, Safwan and Um qasr to Iraq with a space of about a mile to spare'*. But in fact a straight line drawn as Colonel Dickson suggested passes very much more than one mile to the south of Um ^aar, and corresponds in no way with the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkiah Agreement, to which Colonel Dickson seems at no time to have referred. Colonel Dickson 1 s suggestion, which formed the nucleus of the expanded definition of 1940, was therefore baseu on a misapprehension which has only now become apparent• / (b)^ / (b) Tha absent of Ilia Majesty's Government to Colonel Dickson’s suggestion was accorded in the belief that 'no material point' was thereby involved. At the time when assent was given that belief was justified; but now, in view of the facts at. ted in paragraph 5 of this note, a point of the great est material importance has become involved. (c) The expanded definition was accepted by H.H.the Shaikh of Kuwait on the understanding that it constituted merily a re-affirmation, in more detailed form, of the existing boundary. If the expanded definition involves a divergence from the existing boundary (i.e. the boundary intended to be delineated by the Green Line), the Shaikh’s assent ie obviously void • r* r *** (d) The Iraq. Government have neither accepted nor reject ed the expanded definition proposed to them. But it is of interest, and may oe of importance, to note that the Iraq Government have not been informed of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s acceptance of the expanded definition. ‘Jn the contrary, they were informed by H.M.’e jtfabas&amp;ador at Bagdad in the concluding paragraph of hie letter of 7th October 1340, that, if they on their part agreed to the proposals made to them, he would 'endeavour to obtain, through the proper channel, the formal agreement of His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait'. The Shaikh of Kuwait is not, therefore, vis a vis the Iraq Government, committed to acceptance of the expanded definition. 9. To appreciate the significance of the Ereen Line it is necessary to review the circumstances in which it was devised. In 1911 it was decided by His Majesty’s Government that, as part of an arrangement for British participation in the Bagdad railway, the time had come to discuss with the Turkish Govern ment a settlement of the Kuwait question, .after a preliminary exchange of notes His Majesty’s Government addressed to the / Ottoman/ 11 * -7- Ottonan ^oyarnment on July t th 1912 a detailed HeMorandun. ■ Annex 4 to that i'emoranduiu contains a description of the ^ Kuwait-Turkiih frontier ae ’♦a line running from Khor as Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of lirma ^asr and Safwan to .Tebel Sanaai (vide Armexure to this note, serial Ho.II), T&amp;ia description is identical with the description of Kuwait’s northern boundary given in Lorinar 1 s Gazetteer, Vol. II, p.1060 (vide annexure, serial ho.I), In otner words - and this is a point of primary importance - effect was being given to the decision reached by His Majesty* Government at an earlier date that *our obligations extend to th€» whole of the Shaikh’s territory as described in Loriaer*s Gazetteer** (vide India Office letter dated 3oth October i 9 n to Foreign Office). 10. That the definition of the Kuwait boundary contained in Lorimer T s Gazetteer was by no means acceptable to Shaikh Mubarak oi Kuwait is evident from contemporary corrsspendenee. The Shaikh claimed that Safwan and Um ^asr (the latter place being the original home of the Shaikh’s ancestors) were undoubtedly his; and Captain Shake spear, Political Agent, Kuwait, in the ’♦note on the boundaries of the Kuwait Principality’' which formed an enclosure to hie letter 15o. ~ 62 dated 12th August 1912 to the Political Resident in the Persian Gull, gave the strong support of hie expert knowledge to the Shaikh’s claim. His Majesty’s Gov rnment were not. however, prepared to make any substantial alteration to the definition of the Kuwait boundary which nad already been proposed to the Turkish Government; and the definition of the frontier contained in Article 7 of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1915 (vide Annexure to this note, serial Ho. VI) is, if not identical in words, identical in substance with Lorimer’s description (Annexure, serial Ho.X).- 8 - 11. The statement that the defintion of the frontier contained in article 7 of the ^nglo-Turkish .agreement of 29th July 1913 is identical in substance with Lorimer’e description is the basis of arguments contained in a later part of this note; and it would therefore be as well to justify it at this stage. It has been shown (vide para 9 uhove) that the defintion of the frontier contained in ,mnex 4 to the Memorandum of 18th July 1912 (annexure, serial Ho. II) was intended to be, and was in fact, identical with Lorimer* s defintion. Intermediate between the defintion of 18th July 1912 and the definition finally adopted in the agreement of 29th July 1913 came three other defintions re produced as serial Uoa.IU, IV and V in the -nnexure to this ote. The defintion at serial Ho.Ill is specifically recorded as being a re-Btatement of the defintion contained in ^nnex 4 to the Memorandum of 18th July 1912 (serial Ho.II). But it w.a.1 be noted that two verbal changes have occurred:- (a) ihe &lt;,r j ting point ol the line is recorded as being M The coast at the mouth of the T/ hor~es-Zubair* instead of sifcply 'Khor-ua-bubiyah'; and (b) the line 'proceeds in a I.w. direction up to and past the walls of the fort of bafwan*. The changes in serial Hos.IV and V are of minor import, but are recorded in the interests of completeness. In serial Ho.IV trie iefinit ion states that the line runs 'up to and past but Including the walls of the fort at dafwan% the three words underlined having oeen added to the definition at serial Ho. III. /md in serial Ho.V the line runs -up to and past but not including the walls of the forts at Urn ^aer and bafwan', the fort at Um *asr having been added to the defintion at serial No.IV. In serial Jo.VI, which constitutes the formal defintion of the Green line, the etarting point of the line is retained as 'the mouth of the Khor Zubair' but the line iteelf is /-9- yi ie defmted aa pasting 'irmoeiiately to the south of dima vaar and Safwan* (as in aerial Nos. I and II) rather than aa «up to and past the walls of the iorto at Uma Hagr and &gt;afwan 4 (ae in aerial No.V). i2# It wil1 diaputed that, where the meaning or intention of the Green Line is ambiguoua, that Line must be construed by reference to the defintion contained in .article 7 of the Agreement of 29 ' h Jul y 1913. iind it is now clear that, where that deflation is itself ambiguoua or obscure, elucidation must be Bought, not in speculation baaed upon the results of surveys subsequent to 1913, but by reference to Lorimer’e Gazetteer, which appears to have been, through out the negotiations with the Turkish Government up to July l9i5 » the soie documentary authority on which His Majesty’s Government relied when defining the northern frontier of Kuwait. i;S * There are &gt; relevant to the subject matter of this note, two points in respect of which both the Green Lirie ’ ** traced on the rea P accompanying the agreement of July 1913, and the definition of that line included in the text of the agreement, are ambiguous or obscure. The first oi these points is the position of the boundary 'immediately to the south of Uin pier and kafwan'. The second point relates to the location of the beginning of the boundary line ••at the mouth of the Khor Zubair*. 14. Reference to Lorimer’s Gazetteer (vide Annex- ure&gt; serial ho.I) and to the intermediate definitions oj. the boundary propounded from time to time by His Majesty's Government prior to July 1913 (vide -nnexure eerial roe. II, III, ITf and V) resolves any i-osuible doubt /h / - 10 - auubt concerning the correct position of the Kuwait frontier vis a vis Urn Stasr and bal'wan. Lorimer define tne boundary as passing w immediately south of Umm ^a^r and oaiwan M - the actual worae used in the formal definition of the boundary finally accepted on July 29th l^io - ana comments that *the influence of the bhaiah of Kuwait is unquestioned up to the very walls of those places’. Ihe words 'up to the very walls of those places are undoubtedly reflected in the words used m the euggestea definitions reproduced at serial hos.lll, IV and V of the -nnexure to this note; ana there can be no douot whatsoever that, at the time when the Green Line was agreed upon, the Kuwait frontier was understood to extend, in the words of Lorimer, 'up to the very warls* 01 Um qaer and balwan. Ihe examination of contemporary records thus shows conclusively that the term *immediately to the south of Urn ,asr and oafwan' can bear one inter pretation only: and that interpretation is one which, uni ortunateiy, has not found a place in the most recent defirition of the boundary. 15 * ’ ihe ^cond ambiguous point is the location of the commencement of the bounaary line at 'the mouth of the ivhor Zuba1 ** i^exure, serial Ac.VI). This point, as has been demonstrated earlier in this note, should coincide with the commencement of the boundary line referred to by Lorimer at the ! KLor as ^ubiyeh* (^innexure, serial Po.l). v,here aoes the “3 hor as babiyeh end? where does the 'Khor ^ubair begin; those c-re the questions which have proved so puzzling in recent years to persons who have tried to interpret the definition of the Green Line contained in the iinglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913 without reference to the circumstances /r\ circumstaneeB in which that definition was arrived at. The truth is, of course, that the defintion was composed v-itL reference to the terms used in lorimer’s Gazetteer, and only by reference to the terms used in that Gazetteer can the definition be properly interpreted. 16. The following quotations are taken from Lorimer’s jd^etteer of the . ersian Gulf, Gel. II, pages 1503 - 1504; --^.asr (Uflrc*)- Properly a spot 7 miles above tfarbah Island, on a prolongation northwards of the Abdullah and Gubiyah Khors. For 6 miles above warbah island the inlet on which U3B ® ' c! ' a£r stands is on the average three-quarters of a mile broad and its depth varies from 6 to 9 fathoms: at 6 miles it divides into two brands, one of which runs for a short distance (perhaps 3 miles) north westwards, narrowing as it goes; while the other con tinues northwards in the direction of Basrah ffo where within Khor Umm qasr or Zubair is the navigation - iey, ioi the channel is winding and the banss are sub merged and disappear at high tide. .ihere is tome doubt as to the true nomenclature of these waterways; but the main inlet for 6 miles above *»arbah island appears to be known locally as Khor-uth- Tha * alab, the small branch running to the north-west as Ahor Umifi qasr, and the large branch running to the north as Khor Aubair n . 1^ • There is no ambiguity in this description. cioi ^ubair does not begin, according to Lorimer, at the junction of Khor Abdullah with Khor Subiyeh.

The term -mouth of tne Khor zubair* denoted in 1913, precisely and without sunbiguity, that point where the inlet forming the prolongation of Khor. abdullah and Sabiyeh bifurcated into two channels, the Khor i:»ubair and the Khor UmH) v,&amp;£r. !«• It sometimes happens, especially in cases afiecting boundaries, that logical and precise interpretation of the words of a definition leads to a conclusion which, from a broader aspect, appeers etrainf.d and unnatural. in this case, however, careful examination and logical interpretation or the terms used in 1913 to define Kuwait's northern irontier suggest, and indeed prove, a boundary line which, so far irom being iorced or artificial, demonstrably conetitutes the nat ural U„k between certain well defined points. That boundary line runs (using the nomenclature employed by Lorimerjfrom the junction or the thalweg of Khor abdullah with the thalweg of tht Khor Sabiyeh along the thalweg of TQior-ath-Tha'alab to the junction of the thalweg of Khor Zubair with the thalweg of the Khor item, qasri thence in a straight line to a point to the13. the south of, and immediately adjacent to, the walls of the fort at Urum Hasr; thence in a straight line to a point to the south of, and immediately adjacent to, the walls of the fort at Saiwan.

A ma^&gt;, incorporating a line intended to mark Kuwait's boundaries, is annexed to the Memorandum of 13th July, 1S12. Unfortunately the boundary line is too coarsely drawn to be of value.

POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. Dated the 3rd January, 1942. Reference to previous correspondence : 1 Kuwait demi-official letter No. C/655, dated the 6th December, DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE. 194£. Name and Date. Subject. 'Tote on the establishment of a Port at IP'M and its effect in peace time on the trade and prosperity of Kuwait. r A / VJ ^ ./ty'U / • | The Estahlishment of a Port at W&amp;H QASK ani its effect in peace time on the trade aM prosperity of Kuwait. GENERAL. For the purposes of this note it is assumed that the new port at Umm i^asr will he found to lie wholly within the boundaries of Iraq, when the frontier is demarcated. Fortunately for Kuwait this is an erroneous assumption as the site chosen for the port is without doubt in Kuwait territory and could only come within the confines of Iraq, as a result of political pressure being brought to bear on the Shaikh of Kuwait to cede territory to Iraq.. This point will be dealt with fully in the body of the note. 2. The establishment of a new port, equipped with the most modern machinery, at Umm Qasr will affect Kuwait both politically and commercially and I propose to deal separately with these two aspects of the question. Unfor tunately the commercial aspect can only be a matter of conjecture and deduction for so many at present unknown factors affect the question. The political side is more easy to forecast for we have ample evidence of our policy in the past and there is no reason to suppose that it will vary to any appreciable extent in the future. 3. CGfi.IERfcAL ^-’ The establishment of a modern port at which ships can berth alongside connected by rail with a major railroad system must have an adverse effect on an undevelop ed and backward harbour some seventy miles to the south at which over-side off-loading into barges must be done and where sudden and often prolonged storms render work imprac ticable causing delay and often financial loss to both shippers and steamship owners. Though the truth of this statement is obvious it is not easy to give concrete reasons in support of itit because, providing that there are no changes in the existing steamer services and no lowering of customs tariffs, there does not seem to he any particular reason why the new port should have any effect at all on the old established one, hut we are not entitled to assume that things will remain unchanged and it is to the distant future that one must look to determine the full effect of Umm 4asr on Kuwait• In normal times the B.I.S.N. Company’s ships call weekly at Kuwait and the ships of Messrs, F. Strick and Company monthly, while the vessels of various Japanese concerns call at irregular intervals and it is reasonable to assume that once Umm Qasr port is established the ships of these Companies will go there where they can berth alongside for no commercial concern will waste time and money calling at an open road-stead when but a few miles away is a modern port and the Kuwait merchants will be left to make the best arrangements that they can to clear their goods, or altematfctply the freight rates to Kuwait will be increased to compensate shipping companies for loss of time in discharging. Thus commercial pressure will be brought to bear in favour of Umm ^.asr and although pressure of this nature will not be particularly effective in regard to merchants who cater for the needs of the local popula tion for the very nature of their business will compel them to remain in Kuwait and to depend more and more on obtain ing supplies by dhow it will stop all large scale transit trade for the merchants in a large way of business who control export houses dealing with Saudi-Arabia will be forced to move their headquarters to the new port where they will be welcomed and where no far sighted authority would fail to grant attractive facilities. Umm Qasr is seventy miles further away from Saudi-Arabia than Kuwait and at one time this extra seventy miles was a serious3- Cbstaole when caiaels were the principal means of transport hut the day of the camel is over for more and more lorries are coming into use year hy year and what at one time £ represented three days journey will not now add more than three hours to the journey to Riyadh. There is a further aspect of the commercial side of the question to he considered and that is the trade that Kuwait does with the Bedouin tribes. These tribes migrate in the summer to Kuwait’s northern territory watering their animals at Safwan, Umm C^asr and neighbouring wells. At present they make their purchases in Kuwait but in future when Umm Qasr is so much closer they will not trouble to come to Kuwait for their summer wants and what is of greater importance their winter loads for Nejd will be purchased at Umm Qasr. POLITIC ALLY. The establishment of an Iraqi port at Umm Qasr on the site now chosen is impossible unless the Shaikh cedes territory to Iraq and this he will never do unless very strong pressure is brought to bear on him. Should the Shaikh cede territory to Iraq his prestige will suffer and his relations with Ibn Saud will be strained for the King of the Hedjaz and Nejd does not view with too favoura ble an eye Iraqi encroachment on to the 'Island of the Arabs'. Even though the Shaikh, under duress, cedes the ground on which the new port will stand he will not have satisfied the Iraqis for he will still own half of the Khor Abdullah and could thus exercise some control over the port and this would be very distasteful to them so that the next move will be to press for the ceding of Kuwait rights in this waterway, and so it will go on until the land on the right bank of the Khor Abdullah and Warba and Bubiyan Islands have all come under Iraq: A • *-4 control. Here one is not dealing with conjecture for such demands have already heen considered hy the Iraq. Government and 'both here and in Bushire there is a not inconsiderable correspondence on this subject. It may be suggested that His Majesty’s Government would never countenance pressure being put on the Shaikh of Kuwait to cede his territory but a perusal of the files in the Gulf Agencies with particular reference to the Date Gardens Case, the case of Shaikh Khazal of Moharamerah, and the suggestion with regard to Khor al Odeid the acknowledged property of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, will convince the doubter that given the right circumstances everything is possible. These are lamentable stories and I regret that I see no reason to suppose that the future will tell any finer tale than the past. Even now when we are in virtual occupation of Iraq, we are apparently unable to exert any very compelling pressure on the Government of that country in regard to the most insignificant of affaires for after seven nfonths we have yet to persuade them to permit the Indian Postal authorities in Kuwait to collect by land, at their own expense, Kuwait mails from the Basra Post office. Unless our conduct of affaires in that country undergoes a revolutionary change, and I see no reason to suppose that it will, is it reasonable to su pose that, once peace has been restored and our troops have been withdrawn and Iraq, is once again being encouraged in her curious experiments in self-government, we shall be capable of or even inclined to resist a determined effort by the Iraq. Government to acquire additional territory at the expense of a weak neighbour even though that neighbour enjoys our protection. No, I am afraid that Kuwait will be called upon to make sacrifices that can but result in the decline of the State.CONFIDENTIAL.

It is essential that we should not lay ourselves open to a breach of faith by failing to conserve Kuwait's interests, and it is also, I submit, very much to our advantage to conserve these interests when as in this particular case they appear to coincide with our own. I would therefore most strongly urge that until the frontier is demarcated on the ground nothing should be done to prejudice the position and give the Iravi Government to believe that we recognise any right of theirs in the new port.

Port will have to handle not only military consignments but also civil importa for Iraq and transit trade for countries beyond ana consequently arrangements for collection and apportionment of port and customs dues will be required. Equally problems of supply of and jurisdiction over labour will arise. 3. ..hile we agree with Ambassador that we cannot now divert energies to frontier delimitation it is essential to set up practical arrangements which will not ultirihtely prejudice claims either of Iraq or Kuwait and will not antagonize either or both of them. Since there seeoa still to be some disagreement between British authorities in Bagdad and Persian Gulf as to correct align ment of frontier there might be difficulties even in 1 ra iing a unilateral ueoiaration of temporary validity enacling Iraq or Kuwait to exercise exclusive jurisdiction. On the other hand Hay’s suggestion for administration by British authorities presumably means British military2 authoritiaa in Iraq and there would be serious objection in imposing this further burden upon them* 4* Problem is therefore one of securing day to day administration without prejudice to boundary question am without provoking non-coperation from either party. We oan only advise that it shoulc be discussed by Ambassador with Resident Persian Gull and General Iraq with a view to seeking best practical temporary solution. lo eibly that might be found in a special joint harbour board corapriaed of British Iraq and Kuwait representatives to exercise over all jurisdiction all revenues being placed in suspense account. - PORgIGB - /• »f^e f3 ^ to.

Kuwait, 30th January 1942. ?Ty dear Jameson, We had a very pleasant flight hack: and I was able to see Umm Qasr from the air which pleased me very rauch. According to the old and erroneous interpretation of the frontier line there is little doubt that the actual quay which will he huilt in the Khor Abdullah will lie in Iraq territory hut two thirds of the port area will he in Kuwait territory while according to the correct interpretation of the frontier the whole area will belong to Kuwait except the railway sidings which are to the north of the Khor Umm ^asr. I very much enjoyed my brief visit to Abadan and only wish that it could have been longer for there is so much of interest to see and it is impossible to condense even a third of it into twenty four hurried hours. Your power house fascinated me, the comparative silence, the cleanliness and the absence of the human element not to mention the tombs of the early Crusaders (1922) in rows at the lower end of the building though unlike most Crusaders txhey are only resting while their younger but larger brothers work. The bitumen filling was interesting. It seems a pity that sue! comparatively expensive drums have to be used. Paper bags for the solid and some form of synthetic skin for the liquid bitumen would have been so much less wasteful. J.A. Jameson Esquire, C.B.3., C/o Messrs. Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.

The litoral translation of Article 7 of the Anglo- Turkish ^^grecnent of 29th July 1913 is as follows i “The line of demarcation loaves the coast at the nouth of Khor £ubair towards the northwest end pisses imodiatoly to the south of Vrxi Qasr and 5aft?sn and of Jabal 5an&amp;Q so as to leave these places and their wells to the vilayet of Basra”. But for the nop attached to the Agreonont I should have regarded this line as coinciding with Loriner , o* Tlio nap however though on a very snail scale and not very accurately drawn distinctly shows the line as leaving the coast at tho southern extremity of the Khor-ath-Tha'alab and then running in a more or less north-iesterly direction to Uaa Qasr where it takes a sharp bend towards bafwan. I now consider from this that for the pPurpose of this Agreement the southern extremity of the Khor- ath-Tha f alab was regarded as tho nouth of the Khor Zubalr and that the frontier defined is a line running fro© the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab at its southern extremity up practically to the walla of utan Qasr and then turning westwards towards Saftran. I was formerly of opinion - vide paragraph 3 of qy letter no.181-3 of 20th December 1941-that the portion of the Qrecn line south of Uuao Qasr was meant to follow the thalweg of tho Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab but as In Article 7 of the Agre&lt; nent the line is described as leaving tho coast and no mention is made ofof any thalwag X find nyself compallod to change ny views, A study or the wording of Article 5 has contributed to this change as it Is stated in it that the r*hor £ubalr Is the northern extresaity of a oeci-circle shown in rod on the nap# The northern extreaity in the semi-circle as shown on tho nap attached to the Agreonent appears, as clearly as is possible in such a small scale and badly printed nap, to coincide with the southern extremity of the Hior-ath-nia 1 alab and the point of departure of the Croon Line# 5# Sir Percy Cox In 1023 described the lino as 'passing south of Sofuan wells, Jabal Canon and Um Qasr leaving then to Iraq end so on to tie Junction of the £hor £ubalr and tie rhor Abdullah'# The most up to date map available at the time shows tils junction at the mouth of the Khor Umn Qasr, of# the jv ^ enclosure ay Printed Letter Ko#168-3 dated 21st December 1941# X have seen a larger scale edition of this map which is still regarded as the most accurate map of this area in the office of tie General Of floor Cacnanding at Basra in which the junction is similarly shown# X would also note here that both in the nap accompanying Loriner's Gazetteer and in the nap attached to the Anglo-Xurkish Agrcencnt tic 'Khor lubair” is shown well to the north of the nouth of the Khor Otoe Qaar as in tho onnoxuro to t.ls letter# Sir Percy Cox however in his nenorandun of the 19th April 1923 states that the line described by him is 'identical with t?ie frontier indicated by tie Croon Line of tho Anglo-Turkish Agreement of July 29th, 1913'# 2h spite therefore of wSiat is stated earlier in this paragraph I an inclined to think that Sir Percy Cox must have regarded the Khor-ath-Tha'alab as part of te Khor Zubeir# He did not however intend his line to end at the tri-Junction of tie Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab Khor Sabiyeh and Abdullah but where the Anglo-Turkish Agreement makes It begin i#e# at tha right bank of tho southern extremity of the Khor-ath-Tha v alab and he also Intended It to run froc Sofwan right up to Ite Qasr and to turn southwards from tliere as it does in the cap attached to the Agreenent# C# When I visited the spot with His HoJesty # s Ambassador4 Ambassador on the 25th February tha tldo was very low and there was no water at all In the Khor tin Qasr which certainly node tho Khor-atli-Tiia 1 alab appear as part of the Khor Zubair, The muduy bod of the Klior Unra Qasr could howovor be seen extending inland for a distance of two or throe miles.

Further an H#E. officer on the spot stated that tho Arabs habitually referred to tho l'hor-ath-?ha 1 alab as the Khor Abdul, oh and that they only referred to the waterway north of the mouth of t2ie Umm Qasr crook as the KUor Zubair. 7. If however we are to take Article 7 of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement as our basis for the definition of the frontier which was clearly Sir Percy Cox’s intention in 1923 the line will in my opinion run from the water’s edge at the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tha’alab at its southern extremity up to a point inmodiately south of Uma Qasr fort. ^ Izanediately t, is a vague not more than 100 yards. I would note that the total diatruce from the water’s edge at the right bank of tho mouth of the Khor-ath- Tha’alab to Ute Qasr fort is so for as can be Judged not less than two miles. This lino will run very close along the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tka' alab and will leave little else than the actual ships’ berths in Iraq territory. 8. Tho above are my personal views. I feel satisfied that on any reading of the various pronouncements the 1940 definition is too favourable to Iraq and as it has not been accepted by the Iraq Government I strongly recommend that it should be regarded as abrogated. It is true that the effect of accepting the line I now propose in place of that defined in 1940 would only be to add to Kuwait territory a narrow wedge of desert but it so happens that at the broader end of tills wedge there are a few square miles of land which will become extremely valuable when the Umm Qasr port develops 9 and X consider that our special relations towards Kuwait nako it incumbent on us to do nothing which will prejudice the Shaikh’s claim to tills land. term but it can be reasonably' taken as indicating a distance/5 6 j) J load* I further consider that there Is nuoh to be said In favour of !lr# Viaaiefield^ definition and on of opinion that if possible no pronouncement should now be rando which will preclude the Kuwait authorities fron arcuinc in favour of It when a comioaion to donnreato tli© frontier is cvontually appointed# 9» ^‘finally with reference to paracraph 2 of your telegren No#290 dated 22nd February 1942 I would respectfully suggest that even though agreement were to be reached now between the various British authorities concerned where the boundary line should run it is possible that when the time cones for actual demarcation personalities and conditions will have changed to such an extent that tiie agreement will be disregarded# I would therefore with oil due deference advise that further attempts to define the exact line of the boundary should be abandoned and that wo should remain content with the position as stated In paragraph 3 of Pile V Majesty's Ambassador's tolegrca dated the 27th February 19 42 to the Foreign Office that part of tto area Is in disputed territory, part in undisputably Iraq territory, and part in uadisputably Kuwait territory and should treat t!io whole area as an exclusively military one for the duration of the war# 10# I cm sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India, His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad, Colonel Prior and the Political Agent, Kuwait# J 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, yy. co /?■ h«/.

As regards this point, I world observe that no aaentlon of the 'Green Line' has ever been wade either to the Shaikh of Kovelt er to the Iraqi Gevemwent end that the letter will ondoobtedly stand by the definition of the frontier te which It has already agreed if a new interpretation which la dstrlwental to its interests is proposed. 5* I turn now to consider the Isaaedlate practical question of the port st Ca® Qasr* 'bile the port construction la we inly being undertaken by Bnited utatea contractors, Iraqi assistance in several directions - notably in dredging and bnoylng - le indispensable* the erppiy of water la by pipe from Iraq; the port will be linked to the Iraqi railway systea; In general the whole undortaking looks northwards, rether than scitthwarda, Iraqi goodwill la thus a most important faetor in tha successful operation of the port* As yon will be aware, the Iraqi Government have at different tines had under consideration theweelves the building of e port in this neighbourhood, and their helpfel attitude towards the present project ie no doubt largely dee te the expectation that at the end of the war they will acquire one at little or no coat to themselves* It would, I consider, have a moat unfortunate effect on their present attitude if Bis kajeaty’a Govemwent were now to repudiate the definition of the frontier which they spontaneously suggested in 1940 * a a f ** it were, to award the whole or even a part of the dock area to Koeeit* I accordingly suggest that, if it should be decided tc abandon the 1940 forrawla for one more favourable to the Shaikh of Kowelt, it would be preferable to await the end of the war before pressing e new definition gm the Iraqi Oevemoent, in order that in the «eantime they may continue to afford the cooperation which le required of then* As things are et present - and more especially since e pert of the new 'town' of tima wear la sited/Indisputably , o»eiti territory - I do not consider that the Iraqi Government eould debtor to the whole area being administered by the British military authorities, as urged in the fourth paragraph of mj telegram So* 1 Tour of the 23th K«brnary; if this is dons, it should be a simple matter to restrict the piece of eataollehnent of any organ of the Iraqi Government to territory which le indis putably Iraqi and thus avoid compromising the eventgal disposition of the doubtful territory, 6* The long-term effect on imperial interest# of the eventual decision regarding the frontier can beet be appraised by yoo, sir, in eonaultatlon with the other interested departments of Hie Majesty's Government. I would only hare offer e few observations* It has been suggested in Lieutenant Colonel Prior's / telegram to the Secretory of State for India Ho, T/394 cf the 3rd x August, 1941, that, if the pert were to become Iraqi after the war, Koweit would be in 'mortal danger'.

It seems most desirable that arrangements shall be mut, simple as possible but problem will undoubtedly be complicated by two factors* (a) that part of port aret must be as. u tea to be amalgamated with Iraq and part with Ku..ait and (b)- 2 - (b) tht.t populetion will be very aiixed» It will presun^bly incluae British military persoimel, British civilian ofiicials some U.S.A. citizens # Icib^ur ^crscn^el v»hich may be partly Iraqi Inaian Kuwaiti partly British Iir ian and possibly others who may fall into none of these categories. 4. If demarcation of frontier is to be avoided it seems to us that solution may have to be sought on following lines. Administration of whole area including police, legisla- tive Judicial financial powers (inducing Customs* should all be vested in hands of one officer or official as Governor who would derive his powers by being appointed jointly by Iraq and Kuwait and would be vested with these powers by both Governments. Port area would in fact be administered under a Condominium ? system to which the Suuan offers an analogy. Governor when appointed could make an ordinance applying generally in area mut. Iraqi criminal and civil law or ? possibly Indian law (if this seemed ^ most convenient). He would h.ve ? the ? comer tc make such loci 1 ordinances as were necessary. He e uld set up a court which might perhaps have Iraqis or Kuwaitis whose services c^uld be called upon in ap ropriate cases. He would organise the Police, It might be convenient if port area were placed outside Custom bounus of the two countries diich could levy locai customs duties on objects other than military supplies consumed in area. Revenue derived from these and from port dues, if any, and other local taxes, could be diverted to costs of administration, 5. Any such solution would of course require agreement of Iraq Government and of Shaikh of Kuwait (as indeed any plan does) ana it is possible that in Iraq the agreement would have to be ratified by Iraq Parliament. Agreement could be explicitly a temporary one pending demarcation of frontier and an ? agreement between Iraq and Kuwait as to mut. of port after the war. - RETAXANDUM -u (50/33/42) With the Compliments of H.M.’s Embassy, Bagdad.

In the first place I must make it clear that we do not admit that the definition of the frontier in nrticle 7 of the Anglo-Turkish agreement of 1913 is any less authoritative than the 1923/32 text. By this I do not mean that we wish to depart in any way from this latter text. I mean simply that, in view of Sir Percy Cox’s categorical statement that his definition of the frontier was, so far as it went, identical with that indicated by the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkish ^».greement, we consider that both definitions are of equal validity and that, where-.either may be ambiguous or obscure any evidence provided by the other must be taken into account. In other words we consider that the identity of intention of the 1923 definition with that of 1913 must be regarded, not merely as a probability (see paragraph 4 of Caccia’s letter) but as a certainty; and we should not be prepared to accept any arguments, such as those at the beginning of his paragraph 10, which imply that the latter text intentionally departed from the earlier one. (^s will be shown below, this does not mean that the two definitions are in fact wholly consistent .) In paragraph 7 of the same letter it is contended that the Sheikh of Koweit cannot ba'se much argument on the 1913.definition because Sir Percy Cox, when he made the statement mentioned above, told the Political xi.gent at Koweit . that it seemed unnecessary to make special allusion to the 1913 Agreement in his communication to the Sheikh. This contention appears to us somewhat disingenuous, and it fails to take account of the essential fact that the Sheikh has entrusted his foreign relations to H. M. G. and looks to them to safeguard his rights. It is therefore incumbent upon us, in any case where there,is a possibility of those rights being infringed, to take into account all the facts and not only those of which the Sheikh may happen to be aware. 3. Since, therefore, we maintain that the texts of 1913 and 1923 are of equal validity,-we are unable to accept ’for the most part your conclusions with regard to the disputed points on the frontier. For example, Hay's definition of the eastern end of the line as running from the water's edge at the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tha'alab” doeo not seem to us an 'excess of ingenuity' but a very reasonable interpretation of the passage in the 1913 text 'part de la cote a 1 embouchure du Khor_2ubair'. .If - , as you contend,-athe corresponding passage in Sir Percy Cox's definition cannot refer to a point on the bank, it does not follow that either text should be rejected in favour of the other; , but that there is a discrepancy between the two which can only be resolved when the frontier is delimited. I should add here that while we share Kay’s doubts regarding Vakefield’s conclusions as to the nomenclature of the various waterways, we agree with him that if possible no pronouncement should be made now which will preclude the Koweit authorities from arguing tah the same lines as v/akefield when the time for frontier demarcation comes. C. 7. Baxter Esq. , Foreign Office, 3.771. C.M. G. , M. C. ,4./A 2 . 4. The other point in dispute is the interpretation to be placed on the words ’’immediafement au sud d'Oumm-Kasr' in the 1913 text*- Here we still maintain the validity of the two arguments set out in paragraph 5 of your letter of May 5th* : ^s regards the first, what ever the imperfections 4 of the map attached to the 1913 agreement, there can be no doubt that those who drew it intended the G-rten Line to bend at Urn Qasr. In paragraph 5 of his letter Caccia argues that this line is only of subsidiary importance, because lines on maps are always subordinate to the text in words. While we do njt dispute this as a general rule, we do not altogether see how it is applicable to this particular case, since there is no suggestion of using the line on the map to prove anything at variance with the text. On the contrary, the line which is referred to in the text, bears out what the text says, and we consider that it should be accepted as a valuable piece of evidence as to the alignment of the frontier at this important point. 5 . With regard to the second argument in your paragraph 5, we do not dispute that some light may be thrown on the meaning of the word 'Oust' in this context by the generally accepted interpretation of 'just south of Safwan'. But it is not the case that 'it has always been agreed' that, if definition by reference to the site of the former notice-board proves impossible, the frontier may be defined as running one mile south of the most southerly palm in Safwan*. You will remember that a suggestion that this definition should be used in the 1940 text evoked a strong protest from the Political Resident, who said that so far as he knew it had never been put to Koweit (see Foreign Office telegram to Baghdad No.381 of august 10th 1940 and the Political Resident’s telegram No*T/26l of august 13th; also paragraph 4 of Newton's letter to Baggallay of ^ugust 30th, No.E.2773/309/91» expressing agreement with Prior)» The only definition of - the -p-oirrt 'Just 'Of-^Bofwan'whictr seem-s- to have, won anything like general acceptance is that it lies at the site of the former notice-board which, according to the Political Resident's telegram No.T/ 380 of September 12th, 1940, stood about 1050 yards south of the most southerly palm of Safwan. While therefore we agree that it may not be possible to accept Hay's suggestion that 'just south of Urn Qasr' means not more than 100 yards from the fort, we equally do not see how the analogy of Safwan can be used to support the 1940 formula which according to Cornwallis would bring the line as much as nearly two miles south of the fort. 6. It will be clear from the above that we are in full agreement with Hay's conclusion that the 1940 formula is top favourable to Iraq. ’While we admit that the formula was not an offer but a statement of H.M. G-'s views as to the interpretation of certain points in the 1923/32 definition, we cannot agree that we are in any way precluded from revising our views if it can be shown that the decisions taken in 1940 were based on imperfect knowledge or inaccurate interpretation. Nor, in our opinion, is it wholly irrelevant that the Iraqi Government did n )t accept the 1940 proposals for frontier delimitation; at least it will surely be conceded that their non-acceptance has left H.M.G. in a freer position in relation to the formula than would otherwise be the case. Cornwallis agrees, in paragraph 2 of his despatch No. 67 ? that legally speaking H.M.G. are not bound by the 1940 definition and as shown below, we do not think it should be impossible to tell the Iraqis now that further consideration of the matter has given rise to some d^ubt in our minds as to the accuracy of the inter pretations which the formula contains particularly as the Iraqis were not informed of the Sheikh’s acceptance of the formula. ~s regards the position of the Sheikh, a study of the letters which the Political Agent exchanged with him at the time (copy forwarded to the Foreign Office/dg) Office unde^* our No. P. 2.4538/40) bears Dut Vakefield's contention that he accepted the formula on the assumption that it represented -no more than a clarification of the existing definition. For this assumption we are responsible; if therefore it can be shown to be incorrect, we can no longer, as - the guardians of the Sheikh's rights, regard his acceptance as binding on him. 7* It seems improbable.from this correspondence that agreement can be reached between us on this question and we are- therefore disposed reluctantly to accept- the view, on which both Cornwallis and Hay are in agreement, that further discussion of the exact definition of the frontier line should be deferred till after the war, and that the administration of the whole port area should be left as an exclusively military one for the duration of the war. In that case the only question which need be decided while the war lasts is what should be the terms of the further communications to. be, made before the end of the war to the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh* Our provisional views are that :- (a) the Iraqi Government should be told that after the war it will be necessary, before deciding what is to be done with Urn Qasr, to demarcate the frontier in the neighbourhood of the port; it would not be necessary for Cornwallis to tell them, at this stage that the 1340 formula has been abandoned, unless they specifically put the question, in kVhich case we. feel that he would have to do so. You will remember that it was suggested in paragraph 4 of my letter No. Ext. 6373/41* of &gt; October 20th last, that something might also be said as to the intention of Il.ivl. G. at the end of the war (or when the boundary question is settled) to., concert .with the Iraqi Government and with the Sheikh the nexre^rsaa^ TTOdirTgemenTS for the constitution jf a Joint Harbuur Board to control the port. Ve understand that the Foreign Off ice. are-not in favour jf this suggestion and we are now*, inclined to agree that until a final demarcation of the frontier shows more clearly the extent of the Sheikh's interest in the port, it would be premature to-.,raise this possibility. (b) , ^ similan communication should be made to the Sheikh, who should also.be told that H.M.G. are unable to. give him the promise for- which, he has asked, viz.,, that none of the port buildings should be handed ^pv.er to the Iraqis after the war. ^».t the same time he should be. assured, once- more that his rights will be fully safeguarded both now and in. the post-war settlement. 8 . The above represents our views on this question, after full consideration of the issues involved and we feel that it is unlikely that the Political Resident will find it possible to modify the'views which he has already expres sed in the m-ittec. ^ *— r copy of this letter to the recipients of your 9 .

Political Resident, Bahrain. No. 852. Dated 4th Seotember, 1942. I have received an extract from Iraq Government Gazette No’.24 of the 14th June, 1942 from our Ambassador giving a Schedule of dues and charges imposed by them on vessels navigating to Umm ^asr port. These imposts contain pilotage charges, Mooring Buoy charges and a general due of 10 fils a ton on native craft of ten tons and over from the 'Sea to Umm C.asr'. Copy of notificat ion is beijfg sent by air mail to you. 2. The Irac Government have no right to levy dues on vessels entering a port which does not belong to them nor have the; anj 7- right to levy dues on vessels enter ing the Khor Abdullah except in so far as their own territorial waters are concerned which should be speci fically described in any notice issued by them. 3. If this notice be allowed to pass unchallenged it may well be produced in the future as evidence to support an Iraqi claim to all t. e navigable waters of trie vhor Abdullah and to Umm 'asr Port itself. Therefore I consider it desirable in order to prevent future mis understanding that the notification should be withdrawn at once. 4. Should the collection of dues be necessary then the Umm 'asr Military Administrator should issue his own notification and having collected his own dues to him discos© of them as may seem/appropriate.

British Smbessjr, (50/66/h2) Bagdad. 13th October, 19U2. Sir, 4'^ ^fith reference to Bagdad telegrsa JfOe k9 of the 27th September last to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, repeated to yon as No. $75* regarding the port of Um Qear,*! have the honour to inform yon that the questions raised in the Express letter No. G/884 of the 9 th September last from the Political Resident ha^e been most carefully considered and discussed with the military authorities of the Persia-Iraq Command. 1 , 2 * ’tfhen the question of the operation of this port was under review earlier in the year, it was evident that the Army would be dependent on the good officea of the Port of Basra for the performing of the services of conservancy, dredging and } , pilotage, both for the approaches and for the Port area Itself, although it was their intention* to administer the port area themselves as a military zone ('ise Bagdad despatch v ' ~vc*, go. 104 of the 13th April and telegram No. 357 of the 4th Way). &gt; v \t&gt; Sir John Ward therefore consulted with a view to his providing similar services in respect of Um Qasr to those which he was already providing for other ports in the Persian • Gulf lying in non-Iraqi territory, such as Abadan, Bahrein, etc. He referred to the need for establishing legal authority for the collection of dues in remuneration for such services, and gave His Majesty's Ambassador to understand that this could be done most expeditiously and effectively by the issue of a notification empowering him to undertake these functions; he therefore forwarded to Kis Excellency the text of the notification which he proposed should issue to legalise the &gt; position* Throughout the discussions on this subject, Sir * John Ward was fully aware that the frontier between Iraq and Koweit had not been demarcated and he assured we that he would * take no action to prejudice this issue. 3. Sir Kinahen Cornwallis accordingly raised no objection to the issue of the proposed notification inasmuch aa it appeared to be little more than a formality constituting the Iraqi Government's approval to the Port Director* s undertaking this additional task in the manner prescribed by him. He gave no reason to suppose that it was of any other character, and as subsequent enquiry has shown, its general terms were in fact suitable for the definition of his proposed services and for the method of remuneration, although some adjustment might be necessary in the scale of dues levied. The notification issued by the Iraqi Government at hie suggestion was in any case unilateral and not the result of any direct request of any British author!tlea, so that it cannot be held to bind Kio Majesty's Government in any way to ad admission that the Iraqi Government were acting within their powers by this action or eatabliahing sovereign rights over the territory to which it applied. It remains therefore to decide, after balancing the long-tem legal considerations against the THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ANTHONY EDEN, M.C. , M.P., ETC., ETC. immediate- 2 - —^ W WMWI ^8'^. « f immediate oonaiderations of polltloal expediency, whether it would be advisable to challenge forthwith the Iraqi Governments right to have issued this notification or whether it would be more 11tic to defer the expression of any doubts until the emareatlon of the frontier is undertaken, with the risk that silence new may be held to constitute agreement in the Iraqi Government pretensions to sovereignty in this area at a later date. &amp; 4* / Aa you are aware, the suggested interpretation of the frontier definition given in 1240^*66*3ir Basil Newton’s despatch No. 471 of the 7th October, 194o) would appear to place the port, without consideration of the approaches, in Jraq and ever since this suggested interpretation was communicated to the Iraqi Government, the letter may well have felt assured that it had tha approval of Hie Majesty 1 s Govermoent. If, therefore, at this stage. His Majesty 9 8 Government were to challenge out-right the propriety of the Iraqi Government issuing a notifiesti6n relating to the area, their action might give rise to profound suspicion on the part of the Iraqis as to the ultimate intentions of His Majesty*s Government with regard to the use of this port when the war is over. the notification indeed was issued in respect of a port which, though long contemplated by 'Sir ^ohn Ward, was actually only begun at the instance of the British military authorities for the furthex^ance of the war effort, and tha cooperation of the Iraqi Government regarding its use flight be impaired if they suspected that it has been located in disputed territory for some imaginary and unspecified ulterior purpose. If, moreover, they should still be of the opinion that the delimitation of the frontier might plaoe the port in Kowoit, their suspicions might be more deeply aroused by our questioning an sdministretive act which they had performed in good faith for the achievement of an iranediete and practicel objects 5* I should therefore prefer to say nothing to the Iraqi Government at present on the assumption, which I regard as reasonable, thst this notification will not, and cannot effect! vly, be quoted in their favour as constituting (by passing unchallenged; a claim to sovereignty over the territoiy to which it relates. If, however, you wish me to obtain from the Iraqi Government acme fonaal communication to eliminate the possibility of any such claim being lodged, I submit that it would, for political reasons, be preferable that I should do go st the instance, or at the apparent Instance, of the Shaikh of Koweit. vhile being assured of the support of His Majesty*o Government in watching over his interests both now and at the time when the delimitation of the frontier is under review, His Highness might be disposed to invite the Iraqi Government to confirm that the present notification had been made without prejudice to any ultimate decision regarding the demarcation of the frontier end that it wee Merely issued, as a matter of administrative convenience to permit the Director- General of Ports to carry out functions necessary to meet the requirements of the British Forces. I would then preaeiit this request on the Shaikh’s behalf to the Prime Minister! ana, feigning innocence as to its origin, express my trust that he would see no difficulty in giving the assurance desired. ’ By this means His Majesty 9 o Government, who for the pact five months have not questioned the propriety of the notification, would not in any way appear to be sensitive to the misgivings to which it may have given rise, and if Nuri Pasha should express surprise at such action, I could point out to him that in the absence of an accepted Ls h r—aoeeyted fr^nllar line, the request of Ula lilghneaa appeared to be eminently reasonable and unexceptionable. I treat 9 however that he would concur In our wiehea without arguing the point unduly. 6« In paragraph 3 of hla &amp;*preaa lettar the Political Resident drewa attention to the point that the third paragraph of the notification ia both unnecessary and also contrary to the previously agreed principle that the adudniatratlon of the port ahould be the sole responsibility of the British military authorities. It will, however, be observed that in this paragraph the words 'where applicable** have been inserted, so ms to provide for this very contingency, and I am now informed by General headquarters, / eraia-Irwq aosrcsnd, that the services named will, in fact, all be performed by their Command, so that the paragraph is already, ae regarde ite contents, a dead latter. General headquarters furthermore state that the servieea enumerated in paragraphs 1/ and 2 eon moat conveniently be carried out by the ort end that the method of remuneration proposed therein la equitable end preferable to other methods, all of which would require aateh detailed sc count lag; they may however wish to content that the actual scale of dues, which are given as for Bears H&gt;rt, should be modified in the caee of lim Qaar, in view of the more restricted nature of the services performed and of the feeilltlea provided at the expense of Hla haj#sty 9 s Government. 7* 1 am happy to state that progrtBB in the catabllstaent and a&amp;.daistratlon of the i'ort la not being In any way hampered by the examination of these legal niceties, and I trust that it' will not ba found accessspy to instruct me to take any action on purely juristic grounds which would have the effect of interrupting the development of this important war enterpriae. 8. 1 •» Bending a copy of this despatch to th« Polltiml Sealdent In tho Persian Oulf, to tl* aoy*m4«8nt of India, the i'OilwIsal Agent at Kcnrelt and to aeneral H.adouart«rs.

Political A.*oncy Kuwait, October 23th, 1942, From - ?iajor T. Hiokinbotham, Political Agent, Kuwait* To - The Hon’blc the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir I have the honour to refer to Baghdad despatch Ho.290 dated October 13th, 1942. 2. In February this year et a meeting between His Excell ency the British Ambassador in Iraq and the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ac which I was privC- liged to be present when the whole question of Umm &lt;&amp;sr v/as discussed the extent to which the Basra Port Directorate would be concerned in the developement of the new port at Urum ^asr was examined and in reply to my stating riiy suspicion that the Basra Port Directorate would endeavour to obtain control of the port and later maice use of what would be merely a war time expedient as a potent argument when the territorial claims of the Jhaiich of Kuwait and the Iraq Government in the Item Qasr area were eventually investigated and my advocating the total exclusion of the Basra Port Directorate from any thing to do with TJium ^asr J^rt His Excellency stated that he had discussed the question with the late Sir John VJard who, far from having any desire to obtain control of the port, was, if anything, reluctant to add to his already large commitments and had no wish to have any connection v/ith the management of the port though he would, no doubt, be willing to give such assistance as was possible in the piloting of vessels and uhe lighting and buoying of the channel in the Khor Abdwllah.It was agreed at this raeeting that the Basra Port Directorate should have as little as possible to do with the Port and that their activities should be limited to Pilotage, Lighting and Buoying, It is therefore difficult to understand Thompson’s statement in paragraph 2 of his des patch under reference that n it was evident that the Army • would be dependent on the good offices of the R&gt;rt of Basra for the performance of the services of Jonservancy Conservancy has but one meaning in connection with maritime matters and chat is the Commission oT Board controlling a port. 3. The sequence of events leading to the present situat- ion is interesting. The Umm ^asr project has been under consideration for some years ; and the files of this Agency contain copies of very illuminating correspondence on the question^and on the Iraq O-overnment’s hopes and fears in this connection. In April of this year the late Sir John Y/ard became Director General of Iraqi Ports and Navigation, an appoint ment which caused comment here (see paragraph 129 of my Intelligence Summary No.7 of 1942) as the ports of Iraq are not so numerous and so im ortant that the creation of such a post seemed justifiable. Some time prior to the 12th of June this year Sir John Ward forv/arded to His Excellency the British Ambassador of a in Baghdad a draft^/notification which he proposed to issue with the approval of his Government in his capacity as Director General of Ports and Navigation, levying certain cnarges on shipping using the port of Hmm ^asr and the approaches thereto. The reasons which Sir John stated necess itated this action have been detailed in the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of Mr. Thompson’s despatch. His Excellency was fully/fully aware hov/ vitally are the interests of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait concerned in the Umci ^asr question and in the approaches to the port through the Khor Abdullah but did not apparently consider it advisable to acquaint the vroverrunent of India with this developeraent nor did he cause an}' intimation o± nis intention to pennit the publication of the notification to be made to the Political Authorities in the Persian aulf who are immediately responsible for safe^arding British interests in the Persian Gulf and the interests of the Shaikh of Kuwait who enjoys the protection of His Majesty’s Government. It would seem that His Excellency acted entirely on .his own responsibility when he caused Sir John Ward to be informed that 'he raised no objection' to publication and the notification was duly issued on the 12th of June. Of so little importance did it appear to the Embassy tn&amp;t it was more than two months before they sent a cony of the notification to this Agency by their Printed Letter Mo.50/61/42 dated August 25th. 4. 3ir John Ward may have been perfectly straight for ward in his dealings with the iijnbassy and firmly believed the arguments lie put forward to cause them to condone his action *-'iG it is possible that the Iraq Government were not so ingenuous. It is well known that the Iraq Government have consid ered the Umm ^asr question very carefully and it is incon ceivable that they can be anything but fully aware of the interest which has been displayed in the boundary question by 3ir John Ward himself, who was one of their own officials, by high British civil and military officials, and various Advisers and Intelligence organisation*and there is little doubt that they are, at least unofficially, aware of our doubts regarding the exact position of the Iraq-Kuwait i frontier/■ V 7 Z)\ ^ © -4- frontier at Uinm ^asr. A port at Umin Qasr may be vital to Southern Iraq should any catastrophe occur to render the use of the Shatt al Arab no longer a practicable proposition and the Iraq Government must do all they can, collect such evidence as is possible, and leave no stone, however mossy, unturned to substantiate their claim to the Umm lasr area, the only possible site for a port # If Umm Qasr is not in Iraq Territory then there could be no question of the Iraqi Director General of Ports and Navig ation legally levying dues on vessels using the port and such fees as were chargeable on vessels using the approaches to the port could only be imposed by agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait who has equal rights with the Iraq Government in the Khor Abdullah. No one would believe that the British Embassy were not also aware of the legal position which is not partic- ularly abstruse and is more a matter of common sense than juristic nicety, and should they approve or 'raise no object ion' to the notification planned by the Iraq Government it could be argued with considerable force that His Majesty f s Representative had no doubt that the Iraq Government were act ing within oheir legal rights in other words that the port was witnout doubt in Iraq Territory. The draft is produced the Director General discourses on the reasonableness of his suggestions with his usual in fectious energy and emphasises his desire not to complicate any territorial issues, and exercises his undoubted powers of persuasion with the result that the Embassy are convinced of the disinterestedness of his motives and the notification is published without opposition from them, in fact with their tacit concurrence and the Iraq Government are in possession of another weapon with which to fight the Umm Qasr battle.t&gt;. i do not consider that the Gilbertlan farce, It is no comedy, which Thompson proposes to stage should he be forced against his better Judgement to try and repair the damage already done will have any satisfactory result. The Iraqis are much better actors and more skilled in oriental diplomacy than we can ever hope to be for they are not handicapped by conscience and would view our amateurish efiorts with the contempt they deserve. T2ie situation is one which calls for clear thinking and plain speaking and the Iraq Government should be told that on mature consideration His &amp;ajeaty*8 Government have decided that they are not prepared to acquiese in their levying foes on the approaches to Urmn Qasr as they do not \ lie solely within their frontiers, nor may fees be levied by them at Utam rasr as the territorial situation of the port .if! still in doubt, that it is fully realised that the Basra directorate are entitled to remuneration for the pilot*- age, buoying, and other services being rendered by them at UtaL: yasr and that it is proposed that the Military Adminis tration of the Utai yasr Area should levy fees on the same scale as that mentioned in the Iraq Government Notification published on the 12th of June, the amounts received being credited to the Basra lort Directorate. Further that Ills Majesty’s Government consider that as the notification in question is improper and unnecessary it should be cancelled forthwith. I heve no doubt that the Embassy and the British Military Authorities in Iraq will be able to ensure that work on the port will be in no way affected by plain speak ing to the Iraq Government. I have the honour to be.

'Conservancy' which can cover everything in the harbour world, was not mentioned. The harmful nature of such a notification must have been obvious and I cannot understand how it was agreed to without nrior reference to Government of India or this Residency. The Shaikh has never had any nl usions about YARD (reference my telegram No.T/209 March 21 st IDHO when he told me that his troubles were 'all from 'AIR!)') and both I and the late Senior Naval Officer vide his signal 08137 ’’arch 24th 1940 (cony to Government of India under Residency minted letter N0.85-S v arch 25th, 1940) have always doubted the motives of the ^ort Director. 3.

Since (by agreement with Trap Government and the Shai&amp;h of Kuwait) Port Area ot QASR is to be adminis tered by British Military authorities, paragraph No.3 of port Directorate’s notification seems entirely in- appropriate. So long as a reguest for its cancellation is put forward for this reason alone there seems no valid cause why Irag Government should object, and l txhink that we must ask: them to take this step since otherwise I fear Shaikh’s rights in any part of the port area would be prejudiced. 2. Paragraph No.l and paragraph No.2 of the notificat ion seem to be unobjectional but I think it desirable that we should put it on record that the port of B asra author ities are by agreement preforming certain services in the approaches to iimm Qasr and levying charges in respect of these services is without prejudice to the rights of the Shaikh. 3. Irag Government cannot dispute the fact that half of the waterway leading at least part of the way up to Umm aasr from the sea is Kuwaits so that for us to reserve Shaikh's rights should not give rise to controversy I presume in fact dues under paragraph No.l and paragraph- 2 - No.2 will lie levyied when vessel reaches the port of Umm ^asr and that they will he collected hy Military authorities and handed over to the ^ort of Basra. Military authorities are considering whether they will levy dues for wharfage and wharf services to ship and cargo at Umm Qasr. On the understanding that they decide to do so they will presumably issue an appropriate notice. 4. I shall he glad therefore if you will address to the Iraq. G-overament a coimnunication on the lines of iny immediately succeeding telegram. 5. His Majesty's Government are responsible for foreign chelations of Kuwait and it will he clear from this communication that we are speaking on behalf of the Shaikh. There seems to he no heed for us to emphasise this point. We cannot of course A dissociate ourselves more from him in this matter. h 6 . You will see that the proposed communication refers to Kuwait's wlll_he water only and makes no reference to the land frontier. It has in fact been designed to avoid arousing controversy regarding frontier and we would greatly prefer open for the time being the question whether His Majes ty's Government should or should not adhere to the 1940 formula or indeed if His Majesty's Government can abandon it. further consideration could of course be given this question at once if this proves necessary but we hope that it will not and that it will be sufficient if you take the line that some part of th area now xx administered by the British Military authorities is likely to.founder when the frontier is delimited to be in Kuwait. Should Iraq Government ask specifically whether His Majesty's Government stand by the 1940 formula you can only say that you must pass the point to me for instructions.

This paragraph is not understood with agree ment with both Iraq Government and Shaikh of Kuwait, port Area is to be administered (by?) treaty (for the ?) duration of the war by British Military authorities and in fact the services for which charges are made in paragraph No.3 are being preformed not by the Iraq Director General of ports and Navigation but by British ilitary authorities who can issue their own scale of charges ror the use of the port, it appears paragraph No^3 has been issued under a misapprehension and His Majesty's Embassy h have oeen instructed to req.uest that it may be cancelled, in paragraph No.l and paragraph No.2 of this Notification a schedule of dues is fixed for vessels using waterways leading up to the port of umm Qasr and dues for pilotage are also laid down. In these waters which are partly Iraqi and partly Kuwaiti i, Iraq Director General of ports and Navigation are by agreement preforming services of pilotage dredging lighting and buoying and it is also agreed that they are entitled to levy charges in/in respect of services so rendered. No objection is in consequence ’taken to paragraph Fo.l and paragraph No.2 of this notification Put it is of course understood that the preforraance of these services during the var in no way prejudices the rights of the Shaikhs of Kuwait in that portion of the waters which belongs to Kuwait.

ITT.! tMlunui^o In addition to influence vVith Prime Minister in April 1942 to you refer, you reported in your telegram No. '8^3 of August 1st, 19^1 that you had explained our plans for development of Uram Qasr to Ali Jowdat, then Minister for Yoreign Affairs and that he seemed to think that Iraq frankly would welcome this step. But as nothing has been put to Iraq Governmentx*so far in vriting I agree that draft in my telegram No. 1127 of December ICtl should be modified if written communication on the lines proposed in my telegram ' T o. 1126 is to oe made at all. I see no objection to amendment proposed by you. t 2 . I do not altogether gpsp proposal in paragraph 2 of your telegram under reply. But I take it to mean that you should arrange orally with Prime Minister for cancella tion of paragraph 5 of Port of Basra notification and that when this paragraph had actually been cancelled you should address a note to Iraq Government, paragraph 1 and 5 which would follow draft in my telegram ,T o. 1127 while paragraph ' T o. 2 would simply take note of fact that paragraph 5 notification had been cancelled. If this course is to be followed I think it would be well to insert possibly at beginning of note, a sentence on the lines proposed in paragraph rT o. 1 of your telegram under reoly.3. A third course seems open to us, viz, to arrange orally for cancellation of whole notification. In this case it would he necessary for Military authorities to issue a new notification authorising collection of dues on vessels using water way just as it /all he necessary for them to issue a notification prescribing charges to he levied in (their ?) area if it is decided to levy charges there. I realise that collecting dues on passing ( mut?) collect-d Port of Basra in payment of their services would involve them in additional work; but, they might he to agree to this if it seemed the best solution; and in fact they were prepared to collect dues ( ° ) could he given to Iraa Government as justification for our request that paragraphs 1 and 2 of Port of Basra notifica tion should he cancelled as well as paragraph ' T o. 3 . 4. \ny of these three courses would seem to me would have to meet our immediate requirements which is to see that the rights of the Shaikh are not prejudiced by port of Basr^ notification. The adopted (temporary ?) third course might minimise chances of friction with Iraq Government now, hut I am not sure that it might not he veil to put something to them in writing without further delay which would show at least by inference that part of Port of »»ora is in Kuwait, tt I fear if we continue to keep any mention of this fact off the record we may make things even more difficult for ourselves than they will in any case he when the time comes for reaching a definite settlement of this question after war. 5.

For various reasons cancellation of the whole noti- iication would be impracticable and hence the Army cannot collect the waterways dues. To meet local considerations the following would therefore be the most satisfactory course if you approve (1) The military authorities and the port Director to reach provisional agreement unofficially as to what notifica tions they should respectively issue, so that the Army shall collect the dues in respect of the harbour services which they themselves perform and which are at present listed in paragraph 3 of the existing Iraqi notification. (2) As soon as this has been done, I would tell the prime Minister that since Urn Qasr is a military port, the Army are running it entirely themselves but that at their request the port Director is undertaking the waterway services. I would add that this means that the Army should collect dues in respect of the services covered by paragraph 3 of the Iraqi notification, and that they would therefore be issuing a notification accordingly themselves. I would then say that my attention had been drawn to the third paragraph of an existing notification issued by the port of Basra which purported to authorise the collection of dues on a certain scale for their services. The prime Minister would appreciate that this paragraph was inappropriate in the circumstances. The military authorities were therefore approaching the port Director for its cancellation as a matter of form. I would also point out to nis iSccellency that since the military were in any event performing all these services there was no financial aspect involved and ask him to explain matters accordingly to the Minister of Communications and Works in order that this administrative act could go through without assuming the unnecessary status of a Cabinet i ssue. (5)The port Director would then submit to his Minister a notification (in terms previously agreed with me and with the Army) cancelling the offending paragraph. ( 4 ) I would then address a Note to the Iraqi Government on the lines described in paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference but since by then paragraph 3 of the Iraqi notification will have been cancelled I should prefer to make no mention of it in any written communi cation: the exact text D would refer to you for approval.

I have spoken to the Frine Minister in the sense decided. His Excellency refused to agree to the cancellation of paragraph 3 of the notification on the ground that this would constitute an abrogation of Iraq*s sovereign rights. He could not admit that the Shaikh of Koweit was concerned in the collection of port dues at Uta Qasr. 2. The Prime Minister gave me a detailed history of the genesis of the port (which owing to the destruction of archives in May,1941, I cannot fully check) and claimed that there had never been any question but that the port was in Iraq. No argument could move him from his attitude and it appeared useless to continue the discussion. 3. So far as I can discover all discussions prior to 1941 were conducted on the basis that if a port were built at Urn Qasr it would be n Iraq, and if this is so the Prime Minister’s stand is comprehensible. He has also a strong argument in that the definition of the frontier proposed in 1940 to the Iraqi Government indubitably gives the present site to Iraq (see my telegram no\ 1 Tour of 1942). If we now cast doubt on this point, the boundary question (which it is desired to avoid raising during the war) will become a major issue which is likely seriously to disturb our relations with the Iraqi Government. In the circumstances I would urge that the matter be left in abeyance, more particularly as the military authorities have now decided that, barring unforeseen developments, it will not be necessary to bring the port into use. 4.

As recorded In ny telegram, General liuri would not admit that the Shaikh of Koweit was ir any way concerned in the matter, nor would be agree that it was more appropriate for the British military .authorities* who would be performing the services, to issue trir own notification regarding charges* ' 2* In a long disquisition on the history of the port the Prime Minister observed that the project had first been mooted at a time when Porso-traql relations were strained and Iraq was looking for an access to the sea which would be immune from Persian interference* He recalled that His Majesty's Government had been asked to arrange for the cession of fcarbah and Bublyan Islands in i. order that Iraq might control the approaches absolutely but had been unwilling to do so; his point was, however* that the ownership of the port site had never been called in question* (In this account General 3?uri omitted to mention that the original proposal had been for a port on Koweit Bay itself, but the.point does not . seem to be of importance.) Furthermore, the Iraqi Parliament had, before and since the outbreak of hostilities, voted and spent money on surveys and dredging* At no time had it been suggested that the Shaikh of Xoweit was a claimant to the area in which it was proposed to construct the port* 3* I pointed out to Jis Excellency that the frontier had C' not been demarcated and that, until this was done, the present vague description left a considerable area in doubt* I recalled further that I had infomod him of our intention to construct a military port at t&amp;a ^asr ani of our desire that the military authorities should themselves administer it without interference* He admitted the latter point and claimed that he had in fact left us a free hand* At the sar.e time and while he would be most reluctant in any way to impede the war effort, it would be too much to expect him to agree loathe cancellation of the notification and thereby admit that the ownership of the port site was in doubt. »fe sincerely trusted that I should not have to raise the matter with him officially* The TJa qasr port project was familiar to everyone, having frequently been discussed ir. parliament and the press* If now he had to make it known that His Majesty's Government disputed Iraq*s title to the site, it v.ould be impossible to avoid an acute political crisis, which must seriously disturb our present relations of close friendsiiip and co-operation* 4* VUth the destruction of nay records prior to May,1941, it is Impossible for me to caraent in detail on the genesis of the tM Qasr project* So far as I can judge, however, the main concern of ills Majesty's Government at the time before Urn qasr was definitely selected was that any port should be in Iraqi territory. \Jm q&amp;sr appears to have been acceptable as a site on The Bight Honourable this Anthony Eden M*C*, M*P*, etc*, etc., etc*- 2 - \ this grotarKi. If, then, It transpires that the site of the present military port Is Identical with (or lies to the .orth of) that selected before the war, the Ira**! Government would nave good reason for claiming that His Majesty^ Government iad recognised the site ©s being in raeji* It is furt. .errr-oro ti^e case that by the definition of the frontier proposed to the Iraqi Government in 1940 the present docks would lie in Iraq 5 this fact was accepted, as stated In my telegram no.1 Tour of the 25 th February* 1942* by the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and, while it is true that the Iraqi Government never saw fit to signify their agreement to this definition, its existence is, surely, a stronger argument In their favour than any that could be based on a unilateral act such as the publication of a scale of jort dues, wiiich will i* fact be inoperative. Thile, therefore, I do not suggest that His ’lajesty’s Goverraaent should here and now concede that the site of the port is in Iraqi territory, I consider that, as a matter of political expediency, we should abandon the attempt to secure cancellation of the offending paragraph of the Iraqi Govcrnnent’s notification* It is possibly of incidental interest to add that the Army, having spent a large sum on the port, have lately decided, in the light of the improved military situation, to stop further development and reduce tlie whole area to a care and maintenance basis* 6 # x am sending copies of thJLs despatch to the Governor- General of India, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent at Koweit. 1 I hav&lt; the hcnoV.r to he with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, hunble Servant, (Sd.)

His majesty‘a Enbassy regrets to note that without prior consultation an approach has been made to the Iraqi military authorities with a view to the protection of installations at Urn H asr by Iraqi troops* It is the policy of Tils Majesty's Government, laid down over a year ago* that the port of Tim ^asr should be administered entirely by the British military authorities and that neither Iraq nor Koweit should take any share in the organisation* It follows that under no circumstances should units of the Iraqi Army - or any other Iraqi institution • be permitted to be stationed within the port area* This essential requirement was fully appreciated by Headquarters* Tenth Army, and careful accorot was taken of it in their nenorandam to General Headquarters* Middle East Forces, No* lGS6/G(S3)l(a) of the 13th April, 1942, which submitted reco endations for the development of the port* 2* In order to avoid reviving during the war the boundary dispute between Iraq and Kowelt* special care has been taken to ensure that the Iraqi Government should not suspect that the reasons deciding a British military administration in the port area (part of which, in any event, Is indisputably in Koweiti territory ana part indisputably in Iraqi territory) are in any way political* It is accordingly essential that General Headquarters, in withdrawing their request for the provision of Iraqi troops for duties in the area, should explain that this revised decision is the result of more recent instructions from the £ar Office relating tc military dispositions within the Contu&amp;nd, (without making any referer.ee to the politlcaJ factor whatsoever)* _-V * r“ CONFIDENTIAL No. J/J ' -4/22.

H.M*s Government might also be preparec to aaa that though lana frontier is in dispute there is presumably no douot that approaches be through ivuwait territorial waters.

Ambassador frequently refer* to destruction of his records. This handicap also affects Date Gardens case and I sug est that Foreign Office who presumably have printed or spare copies of important documents be asked to recscdy deficiency which seriously affects Gulf interests. 3. Nuri makes following point*. (a) He refuses to cancel paragraph 3 of notification and evidently fully appreciates its value to Iraq. It will be remembered that Embassy acquiesced in this notification without consulting us. As wo cannot force them to cancel it we must get round it. (b) That there has never been any question port is not in Iraq. This is simply begging the question. If Shaikh were told port area m&amp; entirely in Iraq he would protest equally vehesaertly* (c) That Iraq had voted sums for surveys and dredging. This can of course give them no clair whatever in fact Shaikh 727( yf( x J protested at the time against their incursions (my T/209 of March 21st 1940). (d) As regards the Shaikh not being claimant to port area Ambassador rightly points out frontier has never been defined. 4. Both in his telegram and despatch Ambassador suggests , that it was the main concern of H.K.G. tliat port should be in Iraq territory. In this connection please see India Office / letter• 2 otter P.Z. 2506/40 of 15th Hay 1940 which was specially written to provent the Iraqis making this claim. The site was not decided before the war but in August 1941 and Ward considered (Foreign Office letter E 6116/58/93 of 5th August 1039 forwarded with India Office letter $852/39 of 11th August) that site south of creek was definitely in Kuwait territory. This is the site which the military authorities have chosen vide Baghdad telegram \ * l--o • JVA to Foreign Office repeated No #309 to Govemnent of India d&amp;t'd 13th Augu.‘ t 1941. Again since the Iraq Government never acknowledged the frontier proposals of 1940 they obviously cannot quote them against us# 6. It remains to consider what action should be taken# . e cannot force the Iraqis to cancel their notification so the only course is to ignore It and issue a parallel notification without any reference to it# If our action is questioned we reply that it is being administered by the Army# The Basrah Port should be excluded unless hired as contractors and with cessation of activity there this should present little difficulty# Finally since approach lies through Kuwait territorial waters no concession of unilateral control by Iraq can at any time be contemplated without Kuwaiti cor sent# BRITCOIiSUL EsuJalStjL* British Beside _ ate-Ge: BusMre, the 28th Tune 1943 ate-General, 1943# Copy forvardod, with compliments, to The Political Agent, KuwaitiSECRET /&amp;0 3 D.O.

If we accept Loriraer as the guide ^and the definition was almost certainly drafted with Lorimer in mind) the interpretation of the Anglo-.Turkish Convention is now clear. The mouth of the Khor Zubair ^i.e. where the Khor Zubair and Umm Q,aar creek join} is the first boundary mark Vpresumably up till now the boundary has been the Khor Abdullah) and then goes N.W. to 'just south' of the fort of umm Q,asr.
