In the clause the two parties agree to respect one another's territorial independence, including those territories described as being under each party's protection. The clause also implies that those territories agree to respect the territorial independence of the corresponding party. In Britain's case, Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat are named as territories under its protection. The file contains correspondence between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd], concerning the granting of the Sultan's permission for Britain to sign the non-aggression clause on Muscat's behalf.The remaining half of the file documents the efforts of British officials to trace evidence of a reported treaty between Persia and Muscat from 1856.Notable correspondents besides those already mentioned include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; John Charles Walton of the India Office. The Arabic language material consists of letters exchanged between the Political Agent and the Sultan (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000026#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000026#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000026#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
