I had a long talk with Shaikh Salman on the 2nd September in the coarse of which I endeavoured to ^ stem a stream of eloquence about Zubarah with suggestions that money should be spent on improving conditions in Manamah and Muharraq. 3. Amongst other tilings I asked the Shaikh how long he thought Belgrave ought to continue to hold his present office. This produced a paean of praise of both Belgrave and Mrs. Belgrave. The Shaikh referred to the services Belgrave had rendered to his father and himself, talked in glowing terms of his ability efficiency and energy remarked that he was doing the work of four men. This gave me an opening to suggest that he required an Shaikh remarking that he did not consider an assistant necessary. the was 4. I have an idea that Belgrave hopes that his son .11 in due course come to Bahrain as his assistant and subsequently succeed him, and that the Shaikh to this plan. X3 c X X' U L. privy 5.

Personally I do not consider the matter one of great urgency, and I think it unlikely that the Shaikh will be shifted from his present attitude until Belgrave snows obvious signs of collapse or until some serious disturbance or breakdown of the administration gives proof of his inability to carry on single-handed. 6. So far as the present administration of the State is concerned, although there is much that could and should be done it is greatly in advance of anything the other Gulf States can show, as the Shaikh remarked in reply to some of my criticisms. / eightman./Ov H Office of the '' ,t r* ^Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain.

Please see belowljoinuting at Ext. 3606/46 on the subject of the British adviser and the administration of the State of Bahrein. Vie have now had estimates of the life of the Bahrein Oilfield and Colonel Hay*s coianents on Sir G-.Prior*s strictures on the financial policy a»d Mr. Belgrave, who. Sir G-. Prior thought, was using an excessively low estimate of the probable life of the Bahrein Oilfield as an excuse for lack of enterprise in expending the State funds. Mr. Russell Brown, chief local representative of BAPCO., is n confident w that the Oilfield should last for seventy years and he thinks we might give the Bahrein Government the figure of fifty. Mr. Stock of the M.P.P. comments that: (1) there are technical uncertainties which make accurate estimation more difficult than with solid minerals; (2) it is uncertain that Bahrein oil will be able to compete in world markets for that length of time. /Mr.StockMr. Stock, however, also says that American practice in estimating oil reserves is conservative and in view of Mr. Russell Brown's confidence the acceptance of fifty years as the official estimate seems very reasonable. Mr. Stock's fears for the marketability of Bahrein oil may also go too far. As the Persian Gulf is the largest source of oil in the Sterling Area, the whole of whose needs it cannot meet unaided, and as dollars are likely to be scarce for the next fiftyfive years (until the full repayment of the American Loan), the demand for G-ulf oil seems unlikely to fall off. A more likely hazard is perhaps the political one - not indeed so much the ultimate risk that the Russians by obtaining control of the Straits of Hormuz might prevent oil shipment altogether (though even then we might use all Bahrein could produce for aircraft anei transit) - but the genuine danger of curtailed payments, by artificially fermented .JtsvJJAca/'/' fji 7 i/t /n**»*~* / 7 n ' ■ (fat* production, and thus of royalty //T rmented strikes. 1 V j ^ / At all events the prospects for Bahrein certainly seem bright enough to justify Mr. Belgrave in initiating a more forward budgetary policy. In the later of his two attached letters Colonel Hay, as was expected, takes a more tolerant view than Sir Geoffrey Prior of Mr. Belgrave, but considers that twenty years in the Gulf have left their mark and that he should certainly retire in December 1949 when he reaches the age of fif-tyfive, if he cannot be induced to do so sooner. We shall shortly have to suggest to the Sheikh the appointment of an assistant adviser, who would succeed Mr. Belgrave when the latter retires. cr&gt; ‘l' t **- C- C&amp;Yt. fi. ok c***.

Please refer to paragraph 4 of your personal and confidential letter i^o .Ext • 3606/46 of the 20th j une 1946. 2. Belgrave has now been in Bahrain for 20 years and this long time in such a trying climate and constant association with Arabs has undoubtedly affected his mentality and sapped his powers of initiative. in addition he is the possessor of an artistic temperament which rarely goes hand in hand with outstanding administrative ability. 3. He is, 1 think, popular with the ohaikh and though there is ill-feeling against him amongst certain classes there is no sign of any open agitation. my instinct at present is to make no immediate change. 4. Belgrave will reach the age of 5b in December 1949, and we should do our best to ensure that he goes then if nothing has induced him to retire earlier. Meanwhile the Political Resident and Political Agent must prod him continually in order to induce him to carry out the reforms and developments which Bahrain’s importance as a centre of oil production and air communications has rendered necessary. .before very long we shall have seriously to consider suggesting to the Shaikh the desirability of finding an assistant for him, who if he proved satisfactory would eventually succeed him. 5.

CWI ♦ 'Would you please refer to your letter of the 15th Ju}.y to Farrell, who is on leave, on the subject of the estimated oil reserves of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein. Obviously, the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be in a better position than anybody else tq assess the reserves of the oilfield which they are working and as the chief local representative has agreed that the Bahrein Government could be informed that at the present rate of withdrawal the oil field could be expected to last until the expiry of the Company's present concession, i.e. 49 years, his estimate is, presumably, a considered one. 7* r e car*, therefore, see no reason why this should not be passed on to the Bahrein Government. . At the same time, if this estimate is being used in con sidering the financial programme of the Bahrein Government for a long period ahead, it may be desirable that they should bear in mind that oilfield reserves are not susceptible of the same accurate estimation as is possible for solid minerals* Present American practice in the estimation of oil reserves is usually conservative, but the whole question is subject to technical uncertainties. Moreover, the question also arises of the continued existence of a market outlet for Bahrein oil. The same American Group controls both Bahrein and Saudi Arabian production and, as you know, the potential output of crude oil from Arabia is very large, while at present the Group's refining facilities in Bahrein and at Ras Tanura on the mainland are relatively*limited. The position of the Group in^relation- 2 - • • t • to world markets is also, 'broadly speaking, tha^. of a new comer who will have to mate his own way in competing for sales outlets. Consequently, it is not really possible to foretell with any certainty what the position as regards marketing of Bahrein oil will be over a period as long as the term of the RAPCO concession. The assumption that Bahrein oil can be produced and marketed at the present ratefbr a good many years to corae is probably reasonable, but it remains an assumption. I am sorry to be so full of reservations, but with the centre of gravity in the oil world tending to shift from the Gulf ttf Mexico to the Middle East, it is difficult to prognosticate on the long term prospects of individual sources of supplies.

They have now sent us a copy of the Political Resident’s reply. Sir G. Prior regrets that it has not been found possible to implement the Government of India* s recommendations for the adoption of a more forward policy in Bahrein; he considers that the whole administration of the State needs overhauling throughout, starting with the Adviser whom he regards as an obstacle to progress. It should perhaps be taken into consideration, in extenuation of the alleged defects of Mr. Belgrave* s administration, that he has to submit improvement schemes to the Sheikh and convince him of their value; and that during the war it was practically impossible to obtain materials for new buildings, roads etc. or efficient officers to fill administrative posts under the Bahrein Government. Sir G.Prior encloses a note of an interview with Mr. Belgrave, wnich /mustmust have been stormy, to say the least of itl They appear to have ranged over a wide variety of subjects such as engineering v/orks, customs, lav/ and order, finance and future policy and expansion; and the Political Resident had many faults to find.

It is thought that most of this should be recoverable, but it does not, of course, necessarily follow that the Company will be able or willing to maintain their present production rate of 1,000,000 tons per annum.

I imagine that the Bahrein petroleum Company are likely to be reticent on the subject but some indication is no doubt to be found in the fact that they have, I believe, recently been installing fresh plant which they presumably mould not do if they thou^it that the Oilfield was likely to run dry before long.

There had of course been an abundance of correspondence between myself and the Political Agent but in the absence of the Financial Adviser to the state it was difficult to come to any tangible conclusions. 3. In the first place i feel that i should comment on the statement in paragraph 4 that Mr. Belgrave 'had done so much in recant years to put the financesof the State on a sound footing*'. The iact is thnt Mr. belgrave is at present the main obstacle to any a dministrative im provement in Bahrain, it is not merely the question of the budget,though that could be criticised from almost every angle, but the general administration of the state which req ires overhauling from top to bottom. During the wap!- this nesidency was/Kept so short of officers tnat it was impossible to attend to matters that were not and until recently the Bahrain state were unable to personnel or plant according to their req irements. Consequently it was impossible either to make plans for the future or to oblige the Adviser to conform to a higher standard of efficiency. I have, in fact, begun to doubt whether it will be posd ble to make much improvement during Mr. Belgrave's tenure of this post. ulf out ent ain 4. As regards the points mentioned paragraph 6, Mr. Belgrave has not apparently felt able to give effect to the suggestions. I must confess that I myself am doubtful of their value in so small a budget, and they will have the drawback that it would render comparison with past budgets more difficult. Further, it must be Bemerabered ±hfc~that Mr. Belgrave is/obliged to submit his budgets to Bis Highness shaikh aalman whose grasp of financial matters is somewhat limited, m this connection it is relevant to mention that his Highness* father was quite unable to comprehend a budget expressed in figures, and it was necessary to redraft them for him in the form of a letter. Finally it appears to me that the proposals in this paragraph depend upon the estimated life of tne oil fields, bo far s i am aware no accurate estimate is available, and such information as i have gleaned places it between 15 and jO years, it will be seen, therefore, that the matter is not so simple as it appears. 5. i thought/-* 5. I thought it would be useful to go over the administration of Bahrain with ur. belgrave and draw his ‘tention to the defects both in this and in the budget, did this on my last visit, affcer carefully studying e ground with the political Agent, and enclose a cojjy tne note I recorded after these discussions, it will seen that the whole administrative machinery of the state requires consideration, and in some cases, recon. struction, and that it must be admitted that we have not yet succeeded in maintaining the requirement of the uovernment of India. I can only say that the matter is being pursued to the best of our ability, and amongst many other pre^cupations, and that where it is found possible to give effect to the recorame dations a tue Uovernment or India this will oe done. lour most obedient aervatn ad/- ueo^frey rrior Political nesident, Persian uulf.

The surpluses owing to under expenditure and under-estimated revenue were over 7 lakhs in 1362, over 19 lakhs in 1363 and although the actuals of expenditure were not given for 1364 it is clear that there must have been a saving over 13 lakhs owing to the greatly enhanced revenue received, k'r. Belgrave said that this was due to the excess receipts of customs revenue and stated that tt was difficult to estimate this accurately in advance, i inquired why he had estimated for a drop in 1364 when it was quite obvious that the war would be going on for ©me time and that there was little chance of a drop in prices. 1 could not follow Mr. Belgrave’s reply to this, i pointed out that the original plan of saving 14- 15 lakhs a year w s now obsolete as the life of the oilrield was obviously secure for some time to come since the uil Company were spending a great deal of money in installing fresh plant. 1 added that so far as i was aware, the life of the field was estimated at between, at the minimum, soother 15 years, and possibly as much as 50 years. Mr. Belgrave did not appear to be aware of this, i drew his attention to the fact that the remark in his report two years ago that people were dying of starvation in vill ges read oddly when one reflected that the state had at that time over half a million pounds in the bank. Mr. Belgrave said that this w as really due to the fact that these people were upset by the change of diet necessitated by the cessation or rice supplies.' I drew his attention to the fact that the word he had used was **starvation 41 . Mr. Belgrave volunteered the statement that when the capital sunk'in food supplies was realised the actual balance of the State would be over a million pounds. 1 said that this gave point to my view that some capital expenditure in the State was justified and added that 1 felt certain he would have to face rising opposition from the public if nothing was done in the very near future. 2 . 1 drew Mr. Belgrave’s attention to the remark in his report that the staf^ad been leaving for India owi n g to inadequate p^y. Mr. Belgrave agreed that the State could well afford to pay as good wages as the (iovernment of India, and said that the position was now quite satis factory as the staff were contented with their present terms. 1 inquired the State Medical Officer’s linancial powers, and Mr. Belgrave said that he was allowed to spend amount spin hisbudget. Mr. Belgrave mentioned that i9-bed hospital for women in Muharraq with a added that there as well. He agreed views as to future med« there was 4^-bed hospital for women in Lady Doctor which was always full, and was a men’s out-patient hospital there that Dr. Snow should be asked for his ical policy in the State. 3 . I inquired tfrat- State and degree of control over the mi ot ineer's fimancial er engineers and Uil Gauger./'V [l&lt;\ \ uil Gauger. The Adviser said that the State Uingineer could spend any eum in his budget, but i was not very clear regarding the degree of his control over/the otner engineers and the,p proposed Oil Gauger. Mr. Belgr ve seemed - to take the view that the Oil Gauger’s appointment would be completely separate, but i pointed out that it was essentially an engineering job and that in the past the State had had to use the state jflngineer for this duty, and that they would almost certainly h; ve to do so a^ m I gave it as ray view that what thejState required was an able and highly qualified engineer who would control all the engineering works in the State as Chief Engineer, i-remarked on the difficulty that was always experienced in combining electrical and mechanical worlc with building and roads, hut said that a single engineering department was pbyiously desirable. 1 w a s£ot very clearwhat the ; qualifications of the new engineer were but understood Mr. Belgrave to s ay that his work would be more on the lines of roads and buildings. I drew attention to the « pp, fact that he had b^en engaged without reference to us. ^ ^* ''^i a point which is being dealt with later on in this^fote.^ fp i suggested that some standarisation of the electrical ( *r''*** L plant might be possible so that spares would be inter- ^ ' changeable, and Mr.Belgrave described the existing plant and said that the point would be borne in mind in the future. I mentioned that the condition of the roads was disgr; ceful and that so wealtny a State could and should improve them. Mr. Belgrave agreed with this and said that he hoped something would now be done, he men.— tioned that new motor vehicales mi had been ordered and said that they were awaiting the arrival of the consulting engineers to conclude the water supply agreement, i drew his attention to the agreement with their supply agents in England, which i observed had been concluded without reference to us, and drew attention to the serious defects in it. 4. 1 pointed^out the advantagesfcf getting a man from uIua the British Council to run education in Bahrain and said i&lt;‘ would make afinal a ttempt to e e#6ne from them, if A this failed then the Bahrain Government would have to imkt O' their own arrangements. In any case there was little object m anyone comingbut now as the school term hacrfiot much longer to run. The disadvantage of a large numoer of boys being educated in iiigypt was discussed and this point is still under consideration. 1 said that it was essential that the technical school must be run by BAi^CO and urged that an early ppportunity be taken to include this obligation in the Concession. Colonel Galloway said that this matter was before the Directors, of the Company, and it was agreed that they should be pressed to undertake/this function^ / I inquired the financial powers of the Director andJMr. Belgrave explained that he was empowered to a^nd any sum included in his budget. 1 inquired whether there was any plan of reorganisation of the pier or the possibility of having a bonded warehouse. Mr. Belgrave replied that there was a proposal to fill in the dock between thqfexi sting pier and the Kanoo Building but said that the Question of having bonded warehouse had not been considered. 1 drewkttention to the fact that la&amp;ria.a Tanura was now being put on the slow mail run and said that i feared thishould divertii good deal of trade from Bahrain which coulcj^robably be retained if a^ondedm warehouse system was introduced as merchants would then be aole to make this a centre for the whole Gulf ancjlhave a much wider scope open to them. Mr. Belgrave inquired whetner they would/would noi^be wiser to take the money while they coula get it. i pointed out that the state didnot require the t money and that the time to prevent nas Tanura developing was now^as oncemrade links were forged they were very presistent. it was ag»eed taat the position would be investigated* ^ 6. JlUQI^LAL— X inquired from Mr. Belgrave t^hat progress he /&gt; was raa ^i n ? i n codifying the regulations and puoli a hi ng Cew. k Pifexrf fS h&lt;Kflfr- a task i suggested snouid be undertaken lb years ago when i was^olitical Agent, Bahrain. Heyreplied that ^ tne^ork was proceeding but that its conclusion was problem- ^ atic. He is considering the apppintraent of Shaikh Salman •c bin Hamad bin Isa to‘'devil'for him, a duty which will give him an opportunity to discov r how much legal knowledge this young shaikh' has acquired in Palestine. Mr. Belgrave confirmed that there were no compilation of State ]b \ S and rules in existence, and that the Sudan P#nal Code, though ri|ti relied on f had not been formally introduced, iipparently His Highness did not careKfibout having the courts bound by set rules for punishments. The Sudan Civil Code is not apparently in force. 7. POLICE. I began by saying that the police in Bahrain wera/costly and inefficient and drew attention to some highly discreditable instances and had occurred recently- namely, the theft o^a^munition from Jidda island where it transpired that nearly half a million rounds had noqbeen properly handed over and were in chargqfof a Lance-Naik. Mr. Belgrave could give no adequate explanation of this, or indeed of the fact that an important prisoner in this case had been allowed to escape by the police and i stated frankly that I thought the whole matter was highly discreditable and reflected seriously upon him. I inquired the functions of the new British Police officers. These are apparenly makingphemselves useful and it is intended that tney should prosecute cases in court in which Europeans and ( Americans are concerned. They are mounted on motor bicycles. Mr. Belgrave said that they were popular with His Highness, which is/very fortunate, i inquired the auitauility of having an Iraqi officer in the Police andpr. Belgrave replied that he was an excellenthen and most useful, i rxpressed surprise that in 1 j y^arsit had not been ground possible to train up a team oqhighly reliable l^c^l men. i inquired Mr. Belgrave’s plians for the future^aHolmder- stood that he ipreviewing the whole matter of the police force and will let us have his conclusions shortly. 6. mAUflix- I observed that Mr. Belgrave was approaching the end of his term in Bahrain, and that it was essential tliat there should be someone who should be fully equipped to take over from him. i inquired whether he did not consider there was a case for reverting to the old position whereby there were three executive officers in the State and having ann ssistant Adviser now. Mr. Belgrave con- I sidered that there was a good case for a^ch an appointment. I inquired about the auditing of the State accounts. This is still conduct d by a firm domiciled in Basra who have enough work in the Island to keep their paxxaaaixxxxxx personnel/— 63 \ peraonnel here for so me five months in the year, fhey are able to audit accounts in Arbi?c and Mr. Belrrave expressed himself thoroughly satisfied with their efforts, i asked Mr. Belgrave to be good enough to arrange for his budgeting m future to have a closer connection with realities, and understood that he hoped to do this. Apparently little has been done in the w^y of tfwb)n planning beyond a proposal to turn the present import yard into a bazaar when the customs sheds are moved out to tne dock that is to be filled in. I drew attention to the extermely unsightly and completely unorganised rabbit warren of a bazaar and stated tnat what was~want«d was a definite plan for the centre of the town by which proper roads would be introduced so that decent shops could be erected. Mr. Belgrave said that the land was in various owaarships but I replied that there was no reason why a plan should not be worked out and the various obstacles overcome . Mr. Belgrave undertook to consider this. 10. iliKOUBASi^T^FaliaLLaTSI. ' 1 said that, to my regret, I had been unable to find any industry that could be effectively encouraged in Bahrain with the possible exception of a briguetting plant which apparently involved difficulties, it appears that the coke has a nigh - ^ ^ 1 coke unsuitable for a nigh sulphur content which makes it cksmithing, but if the coke could be briquetted and exported to Persia it would be a very valuable counter in xxa&amp;JXKii producing supplies in return, so the matter is not simply one for the uil Company but one in which Bahrain generally has alvital stake. The great drawback in locating any industries in Bahrain is the high cost of labour as compared with India, and the fact that they would not be sheltered behind a high tariff wall as in Persia. 11* 1 inquired what progress had been made in agri culture and Mr. Belgrave said that it was proposed to engage an iigyptian who was shortly leaving the Saudi Arabian service. 1 pointed out the drawbacks of engaging men in this haphazard way and said it would be much better for Mr. Belgrave, if he wanted Egyptian agriculturists, to fly to Cairo and go into the matter there where a much larger selection would be available for him. 1 drew Mr. Belgrave^ attention to recent instances of the engagement of European personnel without reference to us and reminded him that he had been warned about this on earlier occasions. He replied that the case had oeen disc/ussed with the ,ndia uffice and tnat He imagined that this had been sufficient. 1 said that the matter would be taken up with the India uffice who would be asked to see in future that such action was not taken without reference to us and reminded him a gain of the position for nia guidance in the future. 13 . 1 inquired whether the swing bridge had paid for its cost or not. Mr. Belgrave replied that it had not yet paid for its initial cost but that this position vvould sftortly be reached. The intention then was to make the bridge free of all tolls, which 1 said 1 was g]a d to hear. Sd/- GEOFFREY PRIOR 2oth March, 1946.
