VlJ&gt;Wk(D / xhe rteeiciency, B’ashire, the /‘f may 1932. S^twW. 'a s \+~Kk o At Dibbah there are two ahaikhe. une is a JowasiY^l Shaikh, who is an offshoot of shargah, and the other, who lives more to the north, a shihmh Shaikh, who is a subject of the Sultan of Muscat. The jowasimi Shaikh has been making numerous complaints to me regarding acts of oppression which he has suffered at the hands of his Shihuh neighbour and, while i have not gone into them in detail, i think there is no doubt that he has considerable grounds for complaint, now, the autnority of the Muscat State over these Shihuh is somewhat nebulous and is represented only, x believe, by the wall of Khassab, who seldom stirs outside his xx own place, i do not know therefore whether they are in a position to investigate the complaints against the shihuh shaikh of Dibbah, but If they can do so it would strengthen their f general authority and be a good thing and x should like to | do something to help the jowasimi shaikh, who, x think, has had rather a thin time at the hands of his neighbour. M Would you kindly mention the matter to uis Highness and ask his views. My own opinion is that the best way to deal with the matter would be for the Kesidency Agent and the Wali of Khassab to go round to Dibbah together in a slopp and/ 1 T.C.W. kowle, C.H.k- 2 - and investigate the coraplaints, and see if they can effect a settlement. if they consider the compla^ts substantiated then it is up to the Muscat state to punish the Shihuh Shaikh^which i should think they could do with their own resources, in any case we should then have an impartial version of the troubles at uibbah, and know who was to blame.D.0.BO.C/ I'iO 13 til June 1932 SubJ$ct»~ DibbUi L*y dear Sir Hugh, pdx 17jf?

The Sultan, whilst admitting that he had written letters to Rashid (which from his description of the contents are obviously those forwarded under your above quoted number), states that he has never sought to bring Rashid under Muscat influence or to claim him as a vassal* It was Rashid on the contrary who sought M protection M and made the overtures* 5* Dibba itself comprises in reality two villages one occupied by the Shihuh, who are His 'ighness’s subjects, and the other by the Qawasimi who are dependants of Sharjah. The Shihuh occupy practically the whole of the north of the Masandum Peninsula north of bibba, which area belongs to the Sultan* 6* His Highness actually at the moment contemplates writing a letter to Rashid telling him that as he is not his vassal nor is Rashid's protection a matter of interest to the Sultan that he (Rashid) had better apply in future for protection to his own proper overlord. 7* **s there would deem to be no objection to such a proposal 1 have not advised the Sultan to the contrary* His action would certainly seem to afford an excellent means of clearing the atmosphere* I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Major, Political Agent H»B«M*s Consul, Muscat*' /..i.b it ^ -v Frcai ...
