Barala off Gwadur on the 1 st November. Having accommodation for only 250 more deck passengers, and 400 having come out in boats and lighters, the Master refused to lower the gangway, whereupon the Mdb*x would-be passengers scaled the side cf the ship by means of ropes (it is not clear what ropes) and in the struggle between them and the crew which followed, most of them seem to have succeeded in remaining on boaxd. „ „ oomnrunication/. The trouble seems to be that owing to lack a »mrm intending passengers from the interior come to the port on the off chance of securing a sailing. Bence considerable numbers accumulate, and if in excess of accommodation, competition to get on board is very great, as at least 15 days will elapse before another ship calls.SMM1 mtiscat iHT&amp;LummM sim.Asa m.io mmaM*.JLMa+ \/ mman, w asmi misimr - 1 IBS* .
