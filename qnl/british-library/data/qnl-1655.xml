Ho&lt;c/55 of 19S6&gt; Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, KUWAIT• Dated the Snd May, 1956. From - The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To - His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London. c\ c E i** Sir, t I have the honour to refer to despatch No.191 of the 16th April 1926 from Eis Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, vit^ enclosure, and to say that I discussed at length the ma^T:ei of the proposed Commission and its terms of reference with the Political Agent, Kuwait. I have naturally not approach- ed the Shaikh of Kuwait on the subject. £. My views as to the Commission are as follows. The Shaikh's property in Iraq can be divided into two main divisions: (a) that covered by the 1914 plec.ge and (b) any accretions v /hich the Shaikh may have maae since then. His Majesty's Government are only interesteo in (a) and their promise covers what tne Shaikh o: t.^at -m actually possessed, not what, by^the somewhat peculiar provisions of the Iraq law, he may be helc by the Iraqi Courts of to-day more than twenty years later to be in legal possession of. It seems to me, therefore, lat t■.e Commission should confine its labours, at a; first place, to ascertaining exactly what the Shaikh was in possession of in 1914. His Majesty's Government's interests /7 -2- Interests In solving this question are otvlous, and the Iraq Government are likewise interested since it is for this area alone that His Majesty's Governnient will require tnem to put the Shaikh in legal possession. With regard to (bj. It is the Iraq Governaent alone who are interested and they can deal with this area under the provisions of their local laws. S. I suggest therefore that a Commission of two experts be appointed with a suitable staff of surveyors: one to represent His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh anc trie other the Iraq Government. The terms of reference for this Commission would be to survey and report exactly what property the Shaikh was in actual possession of in 3 914, taking no notice of claims to title in any part or this area which have been put forward. The work of tne Commission therefore, involving as it would a mere administrative enquiry into an area, and excluding any legal questions ss to the legal right of the Shaikh or claims to any parts or this area, should be fairly simple. Evidence on this point would coneist of documents in possession of the ghaikh, snow- ing, for instance, on what lands he paid taxation to the Turkish Government previous to 1914, and the statement of witnesses: fellaheen etc. The Commission should be authorised to examine such witnesses on oath i. necessary* Each of the higher authorities: His Majesty*s Government and the Shaikh on the one hand, and the Iraq Gover m the other, would agree that a unanimous decision e :#een the two representative experts as to what area was in possession of the Shaikh in the year in question would be mutually binding. Any parts of the area which trie representatives /-3- representatives could not agree on as being in possession 01 the Shaikh in the year in question, would have to be put asice for further arbitration, but I do not imagine that such parts would be at all extensive* ^ 4. In the enclosure to India Office letter No.P.2.r570 of 22na April 1956 to me, it was suggested by the Foreign Office, in their despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador, B&amp;gc&amp;u, that the Iraq Government should be informed that Ms.'}-- ^ ' s Government are therefore not In a position to continue to base their refusal to transmit documents for service on the Shaikh in sucn cases on the simple ground that ne is a ^orej. c L ,n sovereign'. I understand from the same despatch tnat in spite of this communication His Majesty's Government would not be prepared to agree to transmit documents lor sex vice on t.ie Shaikh of Kuwait, but tiie Iraq Government could oi course serve processes on the Shaikh by 'substitute service' i.e. on the Shaikh's agent in Basra or by fixing a notice oi service in some prominent place. It seems to me t Lerefcre that once the communication referred to above has oeen maae to the Iraq Government the 'flood cl actions' against tne Shaikh, referred to in paragraph 8 of the Foreign Oil ice despatch already quoted, may comence. 5, With this possibility in mind and having regard to the Commission I have proposed in paragraph 5 above, it might be better not to make the communication to the Iraq government, and to continue our present attitude until at any r.te - Coamission hare completed their work, and both Els Majesty's Gorernment and the Iraq Governnient know exactly for what area legal title is required for the Shaikh. This attitude might in fact aake it easier for the Iraq Government to prevent actions /-4- V actions against the Shaikh coming into Court, and (as pointed out in paragraphs 9 and 10 of tiiG foreign Oifice le* er alr6ad\ quoted) it is as much in the interests of the Iraq Governaent as of His M&amp;Jesty , s Government that such claims should be kept out of Court. 6. The chief difficulties with regard to obtaining from the Iraq Government legal title to the 19!14 area are (a) that this area is not accurately known, and (b) that there are certain claimants to the ownership of parts of it,i.e. the two mentioned in the Isst para- i graph of Mi. Drower's letter (the judgment holder in 7)^ /the Bashiya case and the plaintiff in the pending L.fi 1 * action regarding the Faddaghiyah Estate), as well as f the list of claimants attached to His Excellency 8ir Archibald Clerk Kerr's despatch No.70 of 8th February 1936 to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. '\)^ vN 7, When the Commission I propose have finished their work (a) will have been solved. This will clear the way to asking the Iraq Government to deal with (b), and when this step is taken I suggest that the Iraq Government might be asked to ignore all claims other than those which have already come into Court i.e. the two cases quoted above as being mentioned in Mr. Drower's letter. One way of disposing of one of these two claims has already been approved of by His Majesty's Government i.e. by the payment of £?000, vide Foreign Office telegram No. 160 dated the g9th August 1934 to His Majesty's Ambassador, Bagdad. This however would still leave the judgment holder in the Bashiya case unsatisfied. I em sending copies^ of this letter to the Government of India, His Excellency The Ambassador, Bagdad, and the Political Agent, Kuwait. I have the honour to be.

Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, KUWAIT. Dated the Pnd May 19S6. a In continuation of my telegram No.306 of 15th April 1936 on the subject of payment to the Shaikh of Kuwait of a lump sum in connection with his date gardens, I have discussed the matter with de Gaury and my views are as follows. Speaking generally I concur with the India Office that Hale's suggestion seems attractive. ^ ^ ; 5^ 8. With regard to the proposed lump sum payment to the Shaikh. This can cover two itemsi (a) what taxes the Shaikh has already actually paid, or (b) (as suggested by the Treasury), (a) plus all future liabilities. 3. While appreciating that the Treasury are anxious for parliamentary reasons to deal with the matter by one '.ump sum (vide your telegram N0.IS6O of 14th April 1936) it seems to ae that (a) is by far the simpler and we can arrive at an estimate, vide py Express Letter No.477-S of SSth May 1954. You will see that Humphrys and I were more or less of the same opinion as to what constituted the Shaikh 1 s claims on His Majesty 1 s Government while Dickson wished to extend these to cover other items♦ 4. If (a) is adopted then future liabilities will be left to be covered by a further lump sum to be calculated at, say, 20 / J.C.Walton Esquire,CB.,MC., The India Office, London.-2- II 20 year# purchase. 5. If, however, we adopt (b) at the present stage we •hall have to make complicated calculations which would probably lead to long correspondence with His Majesty's Government, the result of which will be a further delay in the unfortunate Shaikh getting anything at all. Personally, therefore, I am strongly in favour of (a). 6« If this course of action is decided on, and when the lump sum has been fixed tentatively by His Majesty* s Govern ment, I suggest I be authorised to inform the Shaikh that, subject to any comments he may have to offer, this is the sum wnich His Majesty 1 s Government propose to give him. This will give him an opportunity of airing his views, anc though it is unlikely that he will be able to proc ace any further cogent arguments for increasing trie grant, it will, at any rate, leave him - should he be dissatisfied with the sum fixed - with a less sense of grievance than if he had had no opportunity of a final appeal.

Clauson, Esq., India Ol'fice, Dear clauson, in our official letter No. E 2456/18/93 of the 11th May we sent you copies of a further telegram and despatch from Sir A. Clark Kerr about the Sheikh of Koweit»s date gardens in Iraq. ~ ^ y imt]m - 2. You will have noticed that the telegram contained a reference to Bateman f s telegram No. 87 of April 21st. We have not sent you a copy of the latter, as it was a private telegram to Rendel, mainly concerned with matters unconnected with the present question. The relevant passages run as follows:- 'The Ambassador left for Koweit yesterday 'Nuri Pasha seems anxious to bring about a detente 'in relations with the sheikh, and has written to the 'Prime Minister suggesting (a) that the root cause of 'all trouble is the Sheikh's present uncertainty about 'his properties in Iraq, and (b) that the time has now 'arrived to try and settle this question with a view to 'satisfying the Sheikh. 'i told Nuri Pasha that we too had reached the 'conclusion that it is now necessary to tackle this 'matter de novo. 'Kur^ Pasha leaves for London on or about April '24th 'The present atmosphere seems most favourable and 'may not recur.' 3. We feel that sufficient material is now available to hold the proposed interdepartmental meeting to consider our/* • *' * iff 2. our general policy on the tfiole date gardens quection, and we should like to proceed with the meeting as soon as possible. you will see that Clark Kerr, in this telegram No. 98 of May 1st, suggests that Stafford, who was Financial Adviser to the High Commission and, for some txme after the termination of the mandatory regime, to the Embassy, should be called m. Stafford ! s employment in Iraq terminated a little over a year ago, i believe, but I have now got into touch with him, and it is clear that he has a very considerable knowledge of the whole affair, and would be very glad to assist in any way he can. The only difficulty is that he is now being re-employed by the Colonial Office in Nigeria, and leaves to take up his new appointment early next week. He is however quite free to attend a meeting on the afternoon of priday. May 15th, and i think it would be most useful if we could take advantage of this, provided that it is convenient to you and the Treasury. Wfll you please let me know by telephone if you agree? In that case, 1 would s^ogcst ^5,30 as the time of the meeting, and Renders room here as the place. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J.C.Sterndale Bennett.

A Commission or similar party to study or settle the Shaikh's title in regard to his gardens in 1914 was then in the distant future. It has now come considerably nearer and from the latest despatches it would, appear that it might take shape within a few months. 3 # The Iraq Government have not yet raised, specifically, the question of the legality or not in International law of the position taken up on the Shaikh's behalf in regard to suits in connection with land. Nor do we know how they will meet a frank exposition^ That being so I should have thought it preferable not to commit His Britannic Majesty's Government in this respect to a change of course, which may have difficult, if at present unforeseen, channels ahead, until after the Commission has done its work. /&gt; 4. I agree with the sentiment Expressed in para 4 of Mr.Clausen's letter No. P.-.2570/36 of the 21st April that It Is a pity to abandon a straightforward position,- E - position, but point out that the premise in his letter No.P.Z.2570/36 of the 22nd April is now no longer corrects 5 # The question of possession is not being left on one side any longer, and as far as I can see, the draft despatch was based on that assumption# The draft despatch for this reason would seem to require reconsideration. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, aptain, Political Agent, Kuwait*iil' AIR MAIL. r shire r isidency. 9'o British Embassy, Bagdad. 22nd May, 1936. v ( My dear Powle, We have oust heard 'by telegram from the Foreign Office that instructions for a new com prehensive settlement of the date garden problem will reach us shortly. Meanwhile, we have been asked to send you the English text of the Iraqi Land Settlement Law of 1932. You will find it herein. It looks very much as though a real (though belated) effort is at last being made in London to try and deal with this question on a basis of commonsense. fin*-, £ .

The overriding consideration from point of view of land settlement is not so much documentary proof of owner ship but rather actual Tasarruf over period stated. All thatthe Shaikhs will have to prove is that they have received regularly for the past 15 years their actual ownership share of produce of gardens. I presume that this can be done by production of their receipts or otherwise from their records. This simplifies the issue very considerably and I am anxious to approach Iraqi Government before departing on leave to the United Kingdom on 19th June next.1 ^ I trust that you agree. Important case is that of Shaikh oT Kuwait. If you are able to assure me that there will be no difficulty in his case over guarantee mentioned above I shall go ahead with Iraqi Government at once. Land Settlement Officer assures me that survey will be necessary and that this can be begun beiore Autumn. He adds that there is every reason for moving at once as the longer the land settlement proceciLire is delayed the greater is the chance of failure.

Please telegraph your concurrence or observations. 2. Nothing about suggested plan should be said to Sheikh at this stage. 3. As regards question of possession , if suggestion for applying Land Settlement Law procedure (advantages of which are explained in Foreign Office despatch) is adopted it will be important that Sheikh of Koweit should co-operate by providing papers and appointing reliable Agent to appear before Land Settlement Officer. It may perhaps be hoped that he would be ready to do so if it v/ere impressed upon him that (a) officer is British official and (b) His Majesty's Government's 1914 pledge stands whatever the outcome of the Land Settlement. 4.

As suggestions in Foreign Office despatch appear to offer some prospect of a reasonable and early comprehensive agreement with Iraqi Government, His Majesty's Government do not at present propose to tackle the taxation question by itself in advance of general settlement, as was suggested in Treasury demi-official letter of 24th February, copy of which was sent to you by air mail nn /on 28th February under P«Z.1362/36.

I arrived Kuwait this morning and have studied Foreign Office despatch of 2nd June and India Office Express letter P.Z. 3505 of 2nd June. 2. I expect that the Shiikh can produce proof of 15 years usufructory possession but I cannot be certain there will be no difficulty over this guarantee unless I approach him and instructions in India Office Express letter quoted above are that nothing about suggested plan should be said to the Shaikh at this stage. 3. Further in fairness to the Shaikh and in order to ensure his co-operation by appointing reliable agent etcetera to appear before Land Settlement Officer he should in my opinion be informed of the whole plan which he will naturally want time to think over. If His Majesty's Government give me authority to approach the Shaikh I will do so forthwita. 4. I concur generally with the Foreign 01iice proposal and the claim to title based on 15 years usufructory possession seems very hopeful. - Resident. i C odv sent to Govt.of India and Kt.under P.L.No.C/60 ^ P of 15/6/36) .

Mr# Rondel r«aaii»€ fey way ot introduetlon th« recent history of the queatioiu He said that it Had now become ertdent that an eeaentlal preliminary to a aatlafactory solution was to oie ar up the existing uncertainty about the Sheikh ot Koweit•s titles to his various properties and about the rights of outBidw clai^ntw* a commission to examine the a- quest! an s t on the lines proposes ]»y the .^abassador, might well offer the beat aolution of th^se difficulties. He was inclined to favour a oommission with lifted terras of referenoe, as it was to be anticipated that the Irani ^otemment and the Sheikh would not see their way to agree to a commission with full power to pass irrevocable deoisions as to title* moreover the Iraoi oovemment would hardly agree to include a representative of the iahsifch on a commission with authority to settle rival claims. Mr* Beckett pointed out that the danger of the proposal for a commission with merely inquisitory powers was that it mi^ht bring to light numerous claims against the sheikh. The terms of reference of such a commission would be iaportant and it wouifi be desirable as a preltminpry to secure an assurance fron the lrar?i Oovemment that they would validate the ..heiki^s titles lo his property a» established by the Commissi on. lir, Stafford thought that the main difficulty with a ii ^ ^ • in OtlPMCl commission of enquiry was that it would require fresh legislation to implement its findings; a commission with power — to settle would alao involve legislation, though in that case as a preliminary* The Ira&lt;ix ^overmient would never sponsor any la^ whioh would have the appearance of over •riding the rights;rights of Iraqi bu to the C arte. utm i5eokott enquired wtetlior 1% wouXd km poo»il&gt;ie to diaposo ol the provlmr, af tne a^eiich of Kowoit^ Iraqi properties tluough their expropriation fcy the Ira i OOTomaient 7he 3he^lch , « with proper oo^pcnsation to the aheilch. hr.

This was the process kniwn as ^iand settlements whioh was executed by a cadre of three or four speoially recruited iritiah offioiais in aocordance with the provisions -.jv jf the '.an&lt;» iiettle^ieat ( aw of this law nad itself been passea to give effect to the reoonmendations in the report on 'ijsnd Tenure m\&amp; iielateu vUestions**, whioh had been prepared by Sir ^rnest i.ow»on, a distinguished formsr offieial of the audan ^overnanmt, after the enquiry whic^ he had wade at the request of the rra^i Grovemment.

In reply to a question, Afr. Stafford said that the title to the ownership of the Bashiyeh garden (alienatea from the iheifch by a court Judgement in idab) would not be exempt frocs examination by the land settlement officer• ^/e Mendel said that Mr. Stafford's proposal seeTied at first sight attraotivs* his only misgiving was that it would not ejBSmpt the i aeikh frs» litigation in an Iraqi court although it would be a special lan^ court . He asqresd, however, tfith Mr. Stafford that if there were bona fide claims against the Sheikhs, t ^ese would have to be aiet sooner or later* ^r, Stafxord explained that an lap rtant advantage of the procedure was that all actions in ordinary courts touching the area under ssttleiaent were automatically stayed during the settlement operations. Moreover future litigation o^uld only£| tak® place by way of appotti* from tne «ettlament; officer^ veaiaimm to tiia special court ana whan thaaa eppaala had dispjaeci o£ the titlas remained final and unassailable* ;-:r* dale saw distinct advantages In the new proposal* The findings of the Srltish settlement officer on ^ht to dispose of all trumped-ap clai s against th^ sheikh of Koweit. if on the other hand there were in eatistence valid claims against him these clearly co la not be suppressed and would have to be faced whatever procedure was adopted. Mr» Beckett agrees with ilr* Hale. But he thought that for the proposal to succeeu it would have to be wade clftar;* (1) to the Iraqi Sovernment that His Majesty's Government would accept the decisions of the settlement officer (with any modlfieatioaa subsequently introduced as a result of appeals to the special cjurt); (£) to the Sheikh of Foweit that the 1^14 pledge was not bfing avoided ana that he would be compensated if disp&gt;ssespeO of any land of which he was in ef ective possession at the ti?se the pledge was given. Xr. claason sai4 that we fioald presumably infor* the Sheikh of what was proposed, and in order to secure his^ co-operation we should have to tell hi® that we werv prepared to compensate hiaa for any land in his occupation in 1914 of which he mi^ht be dispossessed as a result of the saettle&amp;env.. kr. hale said that in his view it oould not be assumes that oosipens-^tion would necessarily f llow dispossession. the ottse f r compensation would have to be considered in relation to the grounds on which any piece of land was a/fardee to another party. There ®l^ht # for exaraple. be a c se in which the'a/ later it would be better ~ ^na cheaper - to settie fit least that side of the qaeati n without furtiier delay. i&amp;t* dale recalled that ther Treaaury had alao pronounoed theneelras in far ar of diroroing the taxation iasae^rom the poaaeasion laeae and aettlinf* independently the question o: oorapenaatln^ the 3heiich for his losses through the iniidenoe of the Istihlalc taju their reaaon for taking this view was that all preylous attempts to achieve a oampre. ensive joltttion hud failed.

These conditions were unpalatable to the lj ujmjbiii'll 1 i -• •' ,1. -i Iraqi I (Jovernrient, particularly as the remission of tax arrears would probably involve legislation* To bring in the taxation aspect at this sta^e would certainly aelay the land settlement procedure and might even frighten the Iraqi £overni»ient off it altogether. Ur» jjeokett however, ^aa in f v ur of a Joint solution of the two sides to the problem. His Majesty 1 s Oorernment would be throwing away their bargaining power if they ?aade the concession of allowing the sheikh of Koweit 's title to his lands/lands to be decided by ireql offlcieis working ander an Iraqi law (thae abandoning half their olalm that the Iraqi government should Inherit the 1914 pledge) without obtaining aome oounterpart.

Nevertheless it the land settlement procedure proved likely to take a long ~ ■ '~rrifBriiir • ••**** time it would be possible to consider compensation for tax losses/X osbos as so as the ssttlsmaat prooeciure was imd ^r way and the Iraqi Xrremrnent had glyan ttia requlrad as^uranoas a^aut tax arrears and future taxation* Mr* aendeX said that while ise was relaatant to go against the jud^went of the two persons present who had served in Iraq he thought there was no doubt that His Majesty's JfOvernment ou^ht to aim at a oomprehenslTe and final settlement* iie also shared Mr* Hale's view that it ir**s ast desirable to hasten the payment of oompensatlon* A further c nsidoratijn was that it might well prove neoessary to use the prospect of oompensatlon for tax; losses as an induoement to persuade the Sheikh to aeoept freely the Inrestigatlcm of his properties by the lano settlement officer. Ur* Stafford pointed out that it was teohnloally neoessary to determine the exact boundaries of the Sheikh*s land before assessing their losses frora Iraqi taxation. as regards the attitude of tne Sheikh towards land settlement, he observed that he was not really in a position to object: the Iraqi w Ti n — . - **&amp;' 'zmrnm* ■ -^ ** Jovern^ient could apply their own law to his estates as well as n,mn - ' 'jifti' ' ' inr i nil i iiinniiMir jswaw* —r.--.,.-- ■ -- to any others in Iraq. The conclusion if the meeting was that ^is Majesty^ Ambassador at Jagdad should be instructed to make new proposals to the Iraqi Government for a comprehensive settlement of the whole question of the lands in Iraq occupied by the two sheikhs. These proposals would consist in the application f the land settlement procedure to solve the problem of title, and in a repetition of the proposals first co rmnicated to the Iraqi Oovermaent in January 1934 for disposing of the taxation aspect. The Iraqi Government wouldrN or aiorned that in their desire to aee a fair and last in settlement of a dlapute whioh had now for some years been a soaroe of friotion la ^inglo-Iraql relations His i£ajesty v s JoTernaent were prepared to aoeept the deoisions of the land settlement officer (with any fnodifieetlons introduced by appeals to the special court) and not to make any further olal i agai nst the Iraqi aoremment in respect of the •ihsikhs 1 properties in Iraq. The counterpart which they would require .-.v. . ■ • ' ~ from the Iraqi SoTernment was s written undertaking not to claim arrears of taxation due from the sheikhs or to lery discriminatory taxation on the® in future. At the same tliae the Iraqi Gov rnraent would be asked as an act of courtesy to assist His Majesty 1 s JOTernroent in their separate transactions with the Sheikhs hy issuing supplementary instructions to the land settlement officer or officers oonccmed to record in the ■ -- 11-1 ^ 'wwiMi iWMfc mm »o-,_. w&gt; eourss of their investigations the boundaries of the lands occupied oy the sheikhs in November 1^14 when the assurance --nim - - mm . . was given to them on behalf of His Kajesty^ government.

J i' im. After Compliments, I have with pleasure received your letter No.C-156 dated the 16th Safar 1355 (7.5.36), and have understood its contents in connection with the amount of tithes paid on the produce of our properties for the year 1935. Statements showing the said tithes will be forwarded to you in the same way as we did in the case of those relating to the produces of the past years, viz 19 32, 19 33 and 1934» But we rejret to say that we have heard nothing as yet, about the recovery of the amounts paid as tithes during the abovementioned years, and the heavy expenses sustained by us on that account; and in consequence intrigues have played their parts in our properties which have become liable to ruin because of the rebellions of the fellaheen# You must have seen the previous communication with your predecessors in this connection. In fact the application of the tithe system of taxation to our properties has caused us to sustain great losses in several ways:- ?irst - It gave an opportunity to the fellaheen and encouraged those insurgents of them to neglect their duties and insist on their intrigues and seditions, and provided a wide field to those impelled by motives, until the expenses we sepent equalled or probably exceeded the income of the properties. Secondly - In spite of our efforts to deal with the situation in the easiest way possible, matters have jone from bad to worse, and we need not assure you that we are suffering the worst on account of the state of unrest now prevaflLing in our properties, whidi has become 'he &gt;?ot' of th people and newspapers.- 2 - Thirdly - We firmly 'believe that all these fallacies and argumentations arise of nothing but jealousy felt towards us, because we have taken refuge under the shadow of H.M. * s Government, placing our confidence in their cb justice and relying on their sympathy with their loyal frien '.Ve presume that His Majesty's (iovemment and its honest men are aware of the maltreatment which we meet with patience, placing our confidence in the British Justice; and that the premises given us and our ancestors will not be enfeebled under the shadow of His Majesty's Governments protection, seeing that we adhere to them and their solemn Pledge to us both 'inwriting and in words'. For all these reasons and their fallacies I request that our violated rights be restored as also the tithes levied for the past years and the expenses incurred by us on that account, and that matters be reinstated as they had been before the application of the tithes system of taxation to our properties which were excepted by His Majesty^ Governments Pledge. In this connection we should like - to draw your attention to the suppositions and false rumours which are published in the newspapers about us and our properties, and which meet with encouragement in Iraq, while we always try to avoid whatever may give displeasure, being anxious to maintain the privileges of nejglibourhood and to strengthen the bonds of friendship and brotherhood with our neighbours. In conclusion we request you 4; kindly to submit what we have stated above to His iiajesty's Government in whose justice and goodwill we place all our confidence.

His Majesty's Govern ment of course propose to indemnify Shaikh against loss caused by such agreement but this point is not to be mentioned to Iraq Government and if Shaikh obtains his information from Bagdad by indirect means he will hear only of His Majesty's Government's intention to acquiesce in surrender of his rights and not of their intention to indemnify him.

I can very well confirm to you that the question may, as you have pointed out in the aforesaid note, not conflict with our desires, especially that H.M.G. are taking all the necessary precautions to prevent the hands of hoth intrigues and personal ends, while the Settlement process is 'being carried out. I am very confident in H.M.G. 's efforts and favourable auspices. I should like again to confirm to you that it would 'be quite an easy question to prove our usufractory possession (tasarruf) of our properties not only for 15 years hut for several decades. I do not rely on the mode of procdure that will 'be carried out 'by the •Iraqi Government, nor on the way in which they will enforce such procedure, for the 'Iraqi Government have accustomed us to the usurpation of our rights without Justification. But most of my reliance lies in the attention and help which I always expect from H.M.G.

However, the equity and justice, which are the most particular and conspicuous properties of H.M.G- in all their dealings, and which we enjoy, will maintain the right, whatever 'be the efforts of those who are impelled 'by certain ends.

Mr. ftcndel referred to the feet that the origina of the whole problem lay in promiaea which had been given by Hie ajtfsty a Oove iment in the intere&amp;ta of the military operations against the Turks in ^leaopotamia which hpd led eventually to the emancipation of Iraq as an independent St^te. He thought thet this fs&gt;ct ought to raaice the Iraqi Government particularly anxious to cooperate in finding a satlsfftctor/ solution. Nevertheless all atiempts to effect s settlement hitherto had failed end the position was becoming steadily more unaatisfactory as claimants were encouraged, in the absence of a settlement, to try to dispossess the Sheikh of [Co we it of portions of his properties. Mr. Rendel thought that the time had now come to tackle the whole problem once more on a comprehenaive baslss It had been possible to effect an amicable settlement of the railway question and he could not see why the •ame could not be possible in the c ee of the SheiAhs* properties. It was surely a great pity to alio* this question to drag on so as to impair relations not only between the Bheiich of Kowelt and Iraq but also between Iraq and His Majesty's Oovernment. 4. Nuri Pasha said that he quite agreed with J..r. rondel that a settlement of the question was desirable. He said that the Iraqi Goveraient h^-d much sympathy with the Sheikh of roweit and had no desire to harm his intereBts. At the same time he would not conceal from us that the attitude of the Sheifch towards the smuggling campaign from Koweit into Iraq had annoyed the Iraqi Goverruaent, the nore so since the Shei&amp;i never ceased to QQPY sent to ^ bring/hi bring wild accufiations agclnat them of infringing hia territorial right®. Nari ^maha aaid that he peraonally ♦-o Id not allow the attitude of the Bheikh over the smuggling queation to influence him in regard to hia properties in Iraq. Yeaain Paaha, howevert felt differently and according to Nuri aaha hia reaentaetit oyer the aauggling question had led him to reject a propoaal to introduce legislation cancelling the arrerira of taxation teohnically due to the Iraqi Ooverniaeiit from the two irheiicha. §« Turning to the detailed points in dispute about the jrheikJ^s prope ty f Nuri Pasha awlid it was not the fault of the Iraqi Ooverome t that cases hsd been brought in the courts 10 try to dispossess the Sheikh of portions of his properties. Theae cases hwd been confined to ;ne iate garden wh ch the Sheikh had bought during the %ar # but ihlch he had for aome reason fwiled to register in Tapu, although orders had been given after the Uar that all such properties should be registered within a certain period The claimants, aided and abetted by predatory lawyers wor* ng on a percentage batis, had ta en advantage &gt;f this technical flaw in the Sheikas title to bring their cases. as regar is the taxation aspect 9 Nuri Pasha was understood to s.^y that he did not thinx there would be any difficulty in passing legislation to annul the airrars of taxation technically due from the Sheiiche in respect of the period previous to the introduction of the Istihla&lt; tax. 6. rr. Rendel then tola Nuri Pasha that His Majesty 1 a W J | , , t ' 4 Oovertiment had been giving earnest contIderation to the prep* ration of new roposals for a comprehensive settlement of the whole question and he hoped that thete proposals would be communicated to his Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad very shortly for presentation to the Iraqi Governmeat. He begged Nuri Pasha to use all his influence to ensure that these proposals received the -aost sympathetic consideration by the Iraqi Ooverunaat, Nuri Pasha seemed pleased at the idea of new proposals and pro*aised that he would do his best to secure an early settlement.

Ha i Auwal 1^55 (1C • .36) , X beg to draw your attention to certain questions that arise in the courts of 'Iraq and are against the interests of the administration of our properties there. It is an established and in disputable 'act that these properties sire our own properties which have descended to us from our fathers and grandfathers, a fact viiich is known for certain to His Majesty's Government, as well as to our neighbour the I- 1 -aq — nt • -U or a ^eascti that X cannot understand divers obstacles are always put without justification in the way of our agents and officials working in the administration of the said properties. For example when some mischief-makers commit a violation of the rights of landlordship, instead of being dissuaded and advised of the fact, they are encouraged by certain agitators to persist in the prejudice of our interests. The most wonderful thing is that this is the case even in the courts, for when we see the persistency of the fellaheen in their disobediences, and their incited efforts^ to usurp our rights and ruin our properties, we naturally have recourse to the courts, and our motive in doing so is to have matters reinstated in their origin. But it is regretted that these mischief-makers meet of encouragement what entices them to continue on their mischiefs, and instead of asking them to substantiate their unfounded claims, on the contrary we are asked to produce titles of ownership. This inverted logic and the unavailing disputes both tend to our extreme wonder at these proceedings. It is well kno.m to His Majesty's Government that our Fao property does not bear Tapu deeds. This gave an opportunity to certet agitators to continue on their mischiefs, adhering to any means.In short X stould like that you kindly bring to the notice or His Majesty's GoTernment the perpetual injustice that has • befallen our properties in the direction of utility as a]^ in the moral direction, seeing that we are landlords and so entitled to enjoy the full rights of omiership, -lease be sure that had we likad to cive full particulars, that would have taken a lot of time and space -at we give you the questions in brief. ••e ar e ^11 of confidence that His Majesty^ Gro /ernment will give full consideration to these well icnown questions of ours, as the season is approaching and agitations always arise when the fruits are hanging. It is wonderful also that some of the fellaheen claim to be nc' such but landlords. So to what extent should we endure the usurpation of our rights. my request x, tl^refore,repeat/to you to draw the attention of His tlajesty's Government to an early settlement of these toilsome questions. -Usual en din g—5 3 /u Telegrain R.27 P* H .

Thus we shall have a class of land in excess of the 1914 pledge but held prior to and in 1914. This is what I meant in my telegram. If we are not prepared to argue that ''Grardens^ include barren land I suggest that we should ask the Ifaq Government (in more appropriate i ordsl) not to behave in a puerile way and immediately on application of the Law to the area seize the land (as apparently they can do by the Land settlement Law) and announce it in the newspapers as another triumph of the Iraqi Cabinet on behalf of the Nation; which is the sort of thinj which they are c ^uite capable of doinj;.

I don't know if you will think the time is now nearing for a British lawyer to come out to advise the shaikh on the arrangement and checkinj of the documents, witnesses to produce etc. The worse the Shaikh produces his case the more His Britannic Majesty's Government lose. The Shaikh does not want to produce the case badly of course but oriental in^ertia and conservatism may lose him points which could have been saved by little encourage- ment and supervision. It may therefore be considered a good insurance by the Treasury to send out someone from England or Lgypt to work behind the scenes here a little early next autumn. It would be a help to everyone concerned. 5, I would point out that the ohaikh has not yet obtained an ^rabic copy of the Land settlement Law (I am of course encouraging him to hasten to do so) and that his reply as to accepting the Land Settlement Law as a means of settlement was more than guarded. He throws the onus for equity upon ::is Britannic Majesty's G-overnment but as it was pointed out that Land settlement could be applied at any time he was perhaps justified in this form of reply. /. ^ o ^cc-iTranslation oT a confidential letter lIo.R-5/135, dated the ISth Rabi 1 -hani 1255, corresponding to the 4th July 1936, frcm His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the 1 oliti cal ^x.^ent, iluvvai 1 • ..... ^ After Gonpliments, in reply to your, letter ^o. 3-225, dated the 14th -abi Thani 1255 (3.7.36), regarding your enquiry about the nature of our proof Tasarruf in the case of our proparties, I have pleasure in informing you that v/e enjoy the possession of our properties according to the rules observed by landlords of the 3asra Livra• dere 1 can give you an outline of the rule in practice: ./e appoint our own agents and '^arkars' (overseers), estimate the fruit, and jive our privileges as landlords on the 'Dhaman' 1 system (monopoly) , as the public interest may dictate. .7a, also, enjoy the fruit and other garden produces in accordance with the observed rules.

His Majesty's Government are most disappointed at Iraqi desire to liiak up new proposals with smuggling question since their experience is that pogress in solving difficult problems is generally f'■(riw 1 ^ by isolating them as far as possible j nc 1 dealing with each on merits. Object of new proposals was to achieve fair and lasting settlement of land problem continuance of which is harmful to Iraqi relations with His Majesty's Govern ment as well as with Kuvtit anc to gain this His Majesty's Government were prepared to make considerable concessions to Iraqi point of view. See paragraph 8 of my despatch 559. Polity of His Majesty's Government is to remove all sources of disagreement between themselves and Iraqi Government and successful settlement of Railway question encouraged -gp belief that Iraqi Government were of same mind. His Majesty's Government cannot in any case admit Iraq contention that application of land settlement to Shaikhs' lands constitute^ pure concession towards Shaikh by Iraq Government which requires payment in another sphere. Preoccupation of land settlement organisation with other districts was always appreciated here (see paragraph 11 of my despatch 359) but it was hoped that Iraqi Governmentt - 2 - woul 0 spontaneously realise advantage to themselves of disposing of this question. In any case land settlement would presumably be applied in the long run to—aieti dir. ui icts in which Shaikh 1 s lands are situated. Please take early opportunity of speaking to Iraqi Minister for Foreign ^fairs (and if possible to Prime Minister as well) in the above sense and urge them strongly not to throw away present opprtunity of settling date gardens problem by dragging in highly contentious smuggling question. - SECRETARY OF STATE FOR - FOREIGN AFFAIRS * Copy given to P.A., Kuwait.Telegram From To Repeated R.

I Prime Minister who is Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs gave me an opening yesterday to revert to question of Shaikhly properties. I reviewed whole history of case so as to demonstrate that His Majesty 1 s Government had for the past sixteen years regarded it as one for settlement between themselves and Iraq Government. I examined my note in detail with him and stressed the fact 'that it was a hopeful and practical endeavour to start afresh without prejudice to past points of either party and to perpetuate the cordial relations between our / /70 Governments. Finally I read your telegram 133 and latter part of your telegram 182 appealing to him not to drag in extraneous questions however feasible opportunity for a bargain might appear. / v 1 ) ■ After much hesitation amd expression of doubt Prime Minister agreed in deference to your wishes to put note to Council of Ministers on its merits completely divorced from smuggling question. • He asked me not to pursue further my enquiries of Ambassador as statements of Minister for Foreign Affairs had /-n j. p if -2- had gone futher than he intended. He was in a receptive mood and seemed genuinely anxious to improve relations with Shaikh of Kuwait and dissipate existing harmful distrust. He expressed hope that His .er.vy's Government willjnot overlook step he is now taking (which may easily cause much difficulty with his colleagues) if at some future date he asks our help in achieving liquida- tion of vexatious matters between Iraq and Kuwait.'

He has tried to minimize its importance but Minister of the Interior and Minister of Defence persist in alleging that ShaiKh must have been privy to departure oi so large a caravan. It was organized in Kuwait by enemies of Government in Nejef who took advantage of Governments embarrassment. They are looking for scapegoats to bear some of the criticism directed at tnem in regard to the conduct of Euphrates operations. Customs Director is not anxious for our smuggling proposals of last year again to be put to the Shaiiui but tninks it would be well if Shaikh could clear ^■is name over last incident and maiie some friendly gesture covering future. 7 • Failing some such action he is not sanguine of our being able to overcome prejudice of Minister#-from which he himself is a sufferer. -Prodrome- ^opy iaaued to Uov^, of ladia under t.L.x^o.617-b of iQSSj dated 1 c ^ U-t.-il _</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/494</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/494</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/11 XII (D 124) Shaikh of Kuwait's Date Gardens in Iraq'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-28T10:12:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (211 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>Condition: Formerly a bound correspondence volume, the majority of the file's pages have been unbound and are now loose.Foliation: The file's foliation sequence commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.The file contains the following foliation errors: 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E and 1F; 61 and 61A.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between British officials regarding date gardens in southern Iraq owned by the ruler of Kuwait. The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ.In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.The correspondence discusses in detail a number of cases in the Iraqi courts regarding the gardens (then owned by Shaikh Aḥmad) and the attempts made by British officials in Iraq and Kuwait to mediate between the two sides. In the correspondence, British officials discuss whether or not the British Government should compensate Shaikh Aḥmad for the amount of tax he had been forced to pay on his exports from Iraq since his dispute with the Government of Iraq had begun and how the disagreement can be settled permanently. The file includes correspondence between British officials and their Iraqi counterparts as well as with Shaikh Aḥmad.The file includes extracts from the Iraq Government Gazette No. 23 of June 1932 that contains details of the Land Settlement Law No. 50 of 1932 (ff 51-61). The file also contains the minutes from a government inter-departmental meeting (with representatives from the Foreign Office, India Office and the Treasury) that was convened in May 1936 to discuss the issue (ff 85-96).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
