In the autumn of 1923 a tour of the Mesopotamian battlefields was carried out by the instructors and students of the Staff College, Quetta y and the course of the campaign and the principal operations were studied on the spot. This work contains a brief story of the campaign up to the end of April 1917 put together before and during the tour, with a critical analysis of the more important actions and the results of discussions on some of the problems of strategy and organization which arose in the course of the campaign. The first volume of the u Official History of the Campaign ' was not available when the tour was carried out. Had it been, it is possible that some of the opinions expressed might have been modified as a consider able amount of additional evidence would have been available. Where on point of fact the story is at variance with the version given in the official history it has been allowed to stand unaltered, nor have the criticisms been changed in any way. This book does not lay claim to be a complete history of the campaign, for which the student is referred to General Moberly's ' Official History,' but it is hoped that it will prove a valuable supplement to that work and will be of assistance to future students in providing them with a series of short critical studies on the problems of the strategy, tactics, and administration of the campaign. The results of this Staff College tour are considered to be of such value that they are here produced under official auspices. At the same time it must be pointed out to the reader that the views expressed in this book are the individual or co-ordinated views of officers who took part in the tour and do not of necessity correspond with the views of the General Staff. The chapters dealing with the Battles of Shaikh Saad, Wadi and Hanna, were written by Major-General Sir W. D. Bird, K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., and published in the journal of the United Service Insti tution (India) and are reproduced here with the permission of the Council of the Institution. For a detailed account of the battle of Dujaila students are referred to the official History of the Campaign and to 'A Chapter of Misfortunes' by Major-General Sir W. D. Bird, K.B.E., C.B. r C.M.G., P.S.O. The map of Lower Mesopotamia is reproduced from the Official History with the kind permission of the Controller of H. M. Stationery Office. A considerable number of the illustrations were kindly taken for inclusion in this work by the E.A.F. in Iraq.Critical Study of the Campaign in Mesopo tamia up to April 1917 CHAPTER I. Origin of the Campaign and operations up to the occupation of Basra. Wien war was declared on Germany on 4th August 1914, Turkey was not a belligerent. Nevertheless, she had, as we now know, signed a secret treaty with Germany on the 2nd August. It gradually became evident that Turkey was going to take part in the war on the side of the Central Powers. Towards the end of September 1914, in anticipation of war with Turkey, the Military Secretary to the India Office, Sir Edmund Barrow, wrote a memorandum entitled 44 The role of India in a Turkish war.' Sir Edmund Barrow was strongly in favour of an expedition being sent to occupy Basra. The conclusion of his minute ran as follows :— u So unexpected a stroke would have a startling effect. (i) It would checkmate Turkish intrigues and demonstrate our ability to strike. (ii) It woufd encourage the Arabs to rally to us and confirm the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Kuwait in their allegiance to us. (iii) It would, safeguard Egypt, and without Arab support a Turkish invasion is impossible. (iv) It would effectually protect.the oil installation at Abadan.' The most important reason for the despatch of an expedition was, undoubtedly, the protection of our oil interests. In 1914, the Admiralty depended to a considerable extent on the oil from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's wells. At the present time, the Navy is more dependent than ever on this source of oil supply ; for 75 per cent of the oil used by the Navy comes from the fields of the A. P. 0. C. Owing to the import ance attached by the Admiralty to these oil-fields, the British Govern ment had, by 1914, become a large shareholder in the A. P. 0. C. The oil wells are situated at Maidan-i-Naftun, 55 miles in a direct line N.N.E, of Ahwaz. From the wells, the pipe line runs across the mountains and desert some 150 miles to Abadan, where the refineries are located. The wells and the pipe line are entirely in Persian territory. TheynTAn b l 0r Vth + War ' + d v ei)endent for tlleir ^fety on a subsidy Mohammerlh ' ^ t0 infllienCe of Sheikh of: The fact that the A. P. 0. C.'s property was not in Turkish territory would not have deterred the Turks, supported by the Germans, from intri guing with the local tribes, and causing a stoppage of work at the fields.. he Germans had an organization in that part of the world which was. well suited for directing anti-British intrigues and propaganda. This: organization was the firm of Eobert Wonckhaus. The activities of this firm were, firstly political, and secondly economic. Its representatives were trained intelligence agents. Kv^T ^r^ 011 0f the des I )atcl1 of an expedition tad been raised by the India Office, correspondence ensued between the Home and Indian overnments. At this stage, there was no idea of occupying Basra; for Turkey was not yet a belligerent. It was merely a matter of a de monstration at the head of the Persian Gulf. The Indian Government did not favour the project. It would give, they feared, the appearance- of an unprovoked attack on Turkey, the greatest independent Mohamedan w ® r ' 1 116 world. In such a case, they were apprehensive of the effect exaggerated n 0Pmi0n ^ ^ a PP rell ~ P^ed to be In spite of the representations of the Indian Government, the Cabinet, decided to take action. The Mesopotamia Commission, in its report considered the proposal to be sound and justifiable in itself, as likely to : prove an effective counter to German and Turkish intrigues. 9fi ^ e ^7 Go 7™ e nt ^s warned by a telegram despatched on the- 26th September of the intention of the Cabinet to order a demonstration at the head of the Persian Gulf. They were warned to hold ready a Brigade of the 6th Poona Division, 2 Mountain batteries and sappers. On the 2nd October, the Cabinet definitely decide'd to take action, the h orce mentioned above was to sail with I. E F ' A ' He the Expeditionary Force destined for France). Orders as to its destina- haT sITed 81Ven Under Seal and n0t t0 be 0pened until tlle convoy Meanwhile the remainder of the 6th Division was to be held in readi ness to sail, and the belief was to be fostered that its destination was iigypt or Europe. a A 118 a i C I™ nCed p0rti011 of theforce sailed fro m India on the 16th ctober 1914, six days later than was originally intended. This was due to the fact that only ships of a particular draught could be used for the Persian Gulf Force. No ship drawing more than 18 feet could then or can now, cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-al -ArabEvery effort was made to ensure secrecy. It is interesting to note that Brigadier-General (now Lieut.-General Sir Walter) Delamain; C.B., D.S.O., the Commander of the advanced Brigade, telegraphed to the C. G. S. at Simla on the 13th October, that he considered that the destination of his force had been known in Bombay for a fortnight. Deductions had apparently been made from the quantity of rations shipped and the type of ship taken up. The orders given to General Delamain were as follows :—He was to occupy Abadan island with the object of * (i) Protecting the oil refineries, tanks and pipe line. (ii) Covering the landing of reinforcements should these be required. (iii) Assuring the local Arabs of our support against Turkey. In the event of hostilities with Turkey, the remainder of the 6th Division was held in readiness to support his force and he was to occupy Basra, if possible. The convoy carrying the force anchored off Bahrein Island on the 23rd October 1914. The force did not disembark as was the original inten tion. The troops were practised in rowing, in case it should be necessary to make a landing in face of opposition. The water round Bahrein is very shallow. Ships drawing 18 feet had to anchor 3 miles out. H.M.S. Ocean acting as Naval escort drawing 27 feet was anchored no less than 14 miles out. On the 29th October, the Turks took hostile action against the Russians in the Black Sea. Their naval ships attacked Odessa and bombarded Theodosia. Turkish officers landed at Novorossisk and demanded the surrender of the Port. General Delamain's convoy left Bahrein and sailed for the Shatt-al- Arab. The outer bar, some 15 miles from Fao fort, was reached on the evening of the 3rd November. The 4th and 5th were spent in sweeping for mines. On the evening of the 5th, the ships crossed the outer bar and anchored just outside the inner bar. War with Turkey was declared on the 5th November. Before begin ning a description of the operations, it witTbe as well to explain briefly the organization and development of the Turkish army. Shortly before the war the re-organization of the Turkish army was taken in hand by the Germans. The new organization divided the Turkish Empire up into territorial army corps, which were further grouped into Inspectorates. In August 1914, there were 38 divisions, composing 13 army corps. The divisions were numbered 1-40 ; the 19th and 20th divisions did not at that time, exist. Very few of these divisions were up to peace * NoTE .—The occupation of Abadan Island in no way protected the oil-fieldsestablishment. there were not more than 150,000 combatants in the Turkish Army. From the date of mobilization up to the signing of the Armistice 2,700,000 more men were called up. The total number of men of military age available in the Turkish Empire, at the beginning of the war and during the war, was said to be something under 4^ millions. When one considers that a proportion of this number was composed of Arabs, Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Jews and Circassians, in other words of racen who were not reaily good fighting men and who did not have much, il any, interest in a Turkish victory in the war, we must admit that the Turkish effort, judged by these mobilization figures only, was good. At the same time, desertion was rife, and assumed proportions that could not have existed among European nations. It is said that the deserters amounted to 400,000 men at one period. There were large tracts of undeveloped and wild country, where the deserters could live without fear of apprehension. That portion of the Turkish army, with which we are more parti cularly interested in the earlier stages of the campaign, consisted of the 4th Inspectorate, comprising the 35th, 36th, 37th and 38th divisions. The peace location of these divisions was, respectively, Mosul, Kirkuk, Baghdad, Basra. The 35th and 36th formed the 12th Army Corps : the 37th and 38th the 13th Army Corps. These four divisions were composed almost entirely of local Arabs and Kurds. The proper Anatolian Turk has a large contempt for these races,, and he considers them to have no fighting value. But we must remember that all accounts of the fighting, which we have obtained from the Turkish side, have come from Anatolian Turks : and they nearly all show a ten dency to extol the Turk and decry the Arab. Nevertheless, there is not the slightest doubt that the value of an Arab as a fighter in modern war is very inferior to that of the Turk. The divisions with which we chiefly deal at the moment are the 35th and 38th. The 35th, on the outbreak of war, was sent to Aleppo. Thence,. it returned to Baghdad and first fought against us at Shaiba. It was engaged in most of the succeeding operations and was finally disbanded during the siege of Kut. The 38th was at Basra at the beginning of the war. It was severely handled by us and was disbanded soon after the battle of Ctesiphon. This division at the outset had one redeeming feature. It contained an Anatolian Turk battalion, the l-26th. This battalion suffered heavy casualties in the early actions and soon became merged into a ' Muratteb 5J battalion. ' c Muratteb is a term frequently found in Turkish orders of battle. This word is applied to any composite formation not larger than a regiment.The 36tli division we nevei? saw. They were sent off to the Caucasus- front and eventually became the 36th Caucasus Division. The 37th division, as far as we know, had the same career as the 36th. There are various mentions of a few men of the 37th division in Baghdad and elsewhere, but there is no trace of its having been in action against us in Mesopotamia, as a division. A formation that was well known in Mesopotamia in the early stages of the campaign was the Constantinople Fire Brigade, or the Sapeurs Pompiers. This famous regiment formed part of the 1st Army Corps : its permanent station was Constantinople. Th^ Brigade '' consisted of 4 battalions of men specially selected from line battalions.- In addition to being trained gfes soldiers in the ordinary way, they furnished guards at places like the Ministry of War and attended the ceremonial parades in Constantinople. After the capture of Basra the 2nd and 4th battalions, 42 officers and 2,060 men with 2 machine guns, were despatched to Mesopotamia. They took 54 days to reach. Nasiriya and first came into action against us at Shaiba. One more formation of Anatolian Turks deserves mention. This is the Osmanjik battalion. They were originally composed of 450 Fidais- (men who volunteer to fight and die for their country) collected by Suleiman Askari, the Turkish Commander at Shaiba. They were originally intended for special service on the Eussian coast of the Black Sea. They were sent to Mesopotamia instead, and were eventually merged into a Muratteb battalion, with the remains of the l-26t]i Kegiment. A Turkish division was composed of 3 regiments, each normally of 3 battalions. Divisional troops comprised artillery, one squadron of cavalry, and an Engineer Company. The amount of artillery varied. The normal appears to have been 4 field batteries and 2 mountain batteries. The artillery with the Mesopotamian divisions was not up to this standard, and the guns were usually a very mixed lot. The situation on the Turkish side on the 5th November was as follows :— 37th Division Baghdad. 38th Division (6 Arab battalions and l-26th Regiment) at Baljaniya, on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, a little above Mohammerah. In and around Basra, about 8 batteries, half field and half mountain r about 32 guns. The 38th Division mustered some 5,000 men. There was an Arab frontier company at Fao, whither 4 old pattern field guns had been sent^ The Turks had attempted to obstruct the channel of the river by sinking.6 4 ships in the fairway. One of these was a Hamburg-Amerika liner the 'Ecbatana' of 5,000 tons : another was the 44 John O'Scott the other two were small Turkish-owned vessels, one of which was an old light ship. This obstruction was above stream of the junction of the Karun and Shatt-al-Arab. The Turks were not successful in their attempt Ihe ships settled down in shoal water and the passage was not completelv obstructed. It was not found necessary to blow up the 'Ecbatana ' du rmg the war. The light-ship can still be seen close to the right bank. We had one naval sloop up the Karun, H.M.S. 'Espiegle ' Another jomcd our cpnvoy off Fao, H.M.S. 'Odin.' During October the Turks objected to the presence of these vessels in what thev called Turkish waters. But the ' Espiegle' was in Persian water and we had al^ Jiad the right to pass our vessels up the Shatt-al-Arab. n T^e Commander in Iraq at this time was the Vali or Governor of Baghdad, Javid Pasha. He combined the post of Vali with that of Inspector of the 12th and 13th Army Corps. The Com ma nder in lower Iraq was Colonel Subhi Bey, the Vali of ™ Wh f commanded in the earlier fights in Mesopotamia, P * , ® 6 tIlat he rendered at Qurna in December 1914 u &gt; t ?® rati0nS a « ain ' st ^ Turks took place on the 6th Novem- '. ( J dln ' Preceded by 2 steam launches stood in and bombarded the Turkish battery on the shore near Fao fort. The battery was silenced in one hour, whereupon a force of 600 infantrv one section of mountain guns and a few sappers were landed. Two of the transports each towed eight boats, an armed launch towed seven and Naval launches towed a detachment of marines from H.M.S. ' Ocean ' There was no resistance. The so-called Fort at Fao was only a walled ondosure with no banquettes or gun platforms. It was commanded by imbashi of Fao fort. This officer lived in Basra. The Bimbashi was Med by a shell during the bombardment. It was said to have been his first visit to the place. The fort was occupied and the garrison fled up to Baljamya where 3 of them were shot for abandoning their post The 4 guns were dismounted and thrown into the river. of ^ 1 , m , P ° rtanC ? t0 us of Fao w a s tiat it was the land terminal of the Turkish telegraph line and that from here started the cable-a Briteh cable connecting India and Persia with Mesopotamia. The cable had been cut and the telegraph instruments destroyed The system was repaid m a few days. On the 7th, the landing party was re-embarked and the flotilla proceeded up-river till within sight of the refinery at Abadan, 3 miles below the oil works. A suitable place for disembarkation was found 2 miles above the oil works on the right bank The troops began to disembark on the 8th and continued during the 9th and 10th. This place was given the name of Sanniya, 9 miles south of Mohammerah. The force settled down into a perimeter camp From — - SI®anniya,it had been Geueral Delamain's intention to advance and attack the Turks at Baljaniya. But he obtained information that the enemy was advancing^south. He had to think of the safety of the oil works : there was no news of his reinforcements from India : he was out-gunned : he was out-numbered. He knew, however, that the 37th Division, which jnight have come down from Baghdad, had been sent away to the Cauca- -sus. He therefore decided to remain where he was. In the early mor ning of the 11th, his camp was attacked by about 400 Turks belonging to theI-2(ith Regiment. The British force was well prepared, as warn ing of the impending attack had been received from a friendly Sheikh. The Turks were repulsed with a loss of 80 killed and wounded. After this defeat, the Turks withdrew and took up an advanced posi tion at Saihan, 4 miles north of Sanniya. On the 13th Lieut.-General -Sir A. Barrett, k.c.b., k.c.v.o ., Commanding 6th (Poona) Division, .arrived at Fao with the 18th Brigade and most of the divisional troops including the 10th Brigade E. F. A. Communication by wireless having broken down he had received jao news of what had happened up to date. On the morning of the 14th November General Barrett and his convoy steamed up the river and anchored opposite General Delamain's camp at Sanniya. Disembarka tion began at once. The infantry used the ship's boats and were soon ashore. It was more difficult to land the guns, wagons and horses of the artillery. These had to be landed in dhows and lighters and operations were delayed by the strong tide and current, by the lack of suitable land ing places and shortage of steam launches for towing. General Barrett ordered General Delamain to reconnoitre the Turks' position at Saihan and dislodge them if possible without seriously involving his force. Accordingly on the i5th three battalions of the 16th Brigade and the 2 mountain batteries left Sanniya at 0600. Contact with the Turks was obtained at 0710 and by 0930 the Turks had been driven from their positions in the date groves The enemy withdrew towards Ealjaniya having suffered 250 casualties including prisoners. Our losses were 65 killed and wounded. The force then returned to Sanniya. General Barrett knew that the attitude of the riverain Arabs would be dependent on our rapid advance or otherwise. He determined to .attack the Turkish position on the 17th. This was understood to be in the neighbourhood of Zain a little above Mohammerah and 9 miles from Sanniya. Only one Battery of the 10th Brigade had, as yet, been landed, but the 18th Infantry Brigade, the second Company of S. and M. and 2 squadrons of the divisional cavalry regiment (33rd Cavalry) were on shore. Accordingly on the 17th at 0600 the following force moved off from Sanniya :•— 16th and 18th Infantry Brigades (former less i battalion). 2 Squadrons 33rd Cavalry. B8 23rd and 30th Mountain Batteries. 63rd Battery E. F. A. 17tli and 22nd Companies S. and M. 48th Pioneers. Along the river bank is a belt of date palms : beyond this is the desert . The Turkish position was in the desert, their left resting on the date palms. Near the palm groves was a mud fort (Kut-az-Zain) and their trenches extended for some distance inland and at an angle of about 45 a to the line of the palm groves to an old mosque. From here their right was echelonned back in some broken ground. The Turks numbered 4,500 with 12 guns. General Barrett's intention was to turn the Turkish right and drive it back through the palm groves. towards the river, where the naval sloops could co-operate. The 18th Brigade led, finding the advanced guard. They moved some distance inland from the palm groves and parallel to them. At 1000 the enemy's, guns opened fire. The 16th Brigade was then put in on the right of the 18th Brigade. 2 Battalions were retained in reserve, one from the 18tli Brigade and the 48th Pioneers. The 2 Sapper Companies were used in the fighting line one with each brigade. After some time it was seen that the Turkish right extended for a considerable distance and would be difficult to turn. The cavalry who had been covering our left found movement difficult, as a severe rainstorm had come on turning the ground into a quagmire. Horses and guns could only move at a walk. General Barrett then changed his intention and determined to turn the enemy s left and capture the fort, which was the key to the position. This was successfully accomplished by the 16th Brigade. At 1315 the enemy's whole line rose and letreated. They withdrew into the palm groves. At this moment a mirage appeared. This made shooting very difficult. The guns therefore ceased fire. The Turks subsequently stated that they would have been unable to get their guns away had we not ceased fire. Owing to the heavy state of the ground the cavalry were not able to pursue effectively. The pursuit was broken off at 1450 and the force concentrated in an entrenched camp. The Turks lost 2 guns and 150 prisoners. It was stated in Basra that their casualties were 2,000; This was probably an exaggeration. Our losses were 353. As a result of the Sappers being used in the firing line they lost 4 British Officer caaiialties. This hampered their technical work considerably and we find General Barrett wiring urgently to India for Sapper officer reinforcements. The next 3 days were spent in landing supplies and in reconnoitring the enemy s next position atBaljaniya where the obstruction in the riverwas. General Barrett had determined to attack this position on the 22nd November. But on the 21st he received news that the enemy had with drawn and that the town of Basra was in danger of being looted. The force (less 2 battalions) therefore marched at 2000 for Basra ; they arrived at 12 noon 22nd. Two battalions were put on to ships which proceeded up the river. The obstruction was easily negotiated and the battalions were landed at 2100 21st at Basra and took possession of the town. The only damage done was the burning of the Custom House. 5 or 6 Germans were found and interned. The Turkish force withdrew to Qurna with the exception of the 114th Regiment which had not been engaged at Zain or Sahil as we call it. This regiment withdrew to Zubair. 8 guns were captured in Basra of which 4 were in the Arsenal. On the 26th November a naval reconnaissance was made up to Qurna. This reported the presence of 400 or 500 Turks and 2 guns. On the 29th another reconnaissance was made. The Turkish force was then reported to be 500 cavalry, 500 infantry and 4 guns. A few days later the Turks were reported to muster 2,000 men and 7 guns. The 114th Regiment from Zubair had evidently joined up. General Barrett's orders had given his objective as Basra. He was now told to consolidate his position moving as far up the river as was necessary for the protection of this town. He decided to capture Qurna at the junction of the Tigris and old channel of the Euphrates. Accordingly on the 3rd December 2 battalions (104th and 110th) 5 1 Company of the 2nd Norfolks and the 82nd Battery R. F. A. were despatched up-river in steamers accompanied by 3 sloops and 3 armed launches. On the 4th December this force disembarked 4 miles below Qurna on the left bank. The Turks were found in and around the village of Muzaira which was captured. The advance was continued to the river bank opposite Qurna. Here heavy opposition was met with and it was clear that Qurna could not be taken by nightfall. The column then withdrew to the Shwayil Creek 3 miles S. E. of Muzaira. The O. C. Column—Lt.-Col. Frazer—wired to Basra for reinforce ments. On the 6th General Fry arrived with the remainder of the Norfolks, 7th Rajputs, half the 120th Infantry, the 76th Battery (less one section) and the 30th Mountain Battery. On the 7th Muzaira was again taken and the Turks withdrew across the Tigris. Next morning 2 battalions (104th and 110th) marched up river with 1 section of mountain guns. A sapper officer with some sappers swam the river (120 yards wide) carrying a line to which a steel hawser was attached. With the aid of a ' mahela ' conveniently left by the Turks on the right bank a flying bridge was constructed. The little forcfe B 210 crossed to the right bank. It was too late to advance on Qurna : so the force bivouacked close to the bank. No further operations were needed : for at mid-night a steamer blazing with lights was observed coming down stream. A messenger from Colonel Subhi Bey , the Commander of the 38th Division, was on board, and brought an offer of surrender. Next day at 1300 the Turkish force surrendered numbering 45 officers, 1,000 men and 7 guns. A number of the Turks including the Osmanjik battalion escaped. These small operations provide us with the first example during the Mesopotamian Campaign of a faulty system of command and breaking of organization which were very common during the earlier stages of the campaign. A small mixed force was considered necessary to capture Qurna. This force had to co-operate with the Navy. Instead of sending in the first instance 2 battalions from one brigade under the command of the Brigadier, 2 battalions from different brigades were chosen under the command of the senior battalion commander, who was allotted no staff. This ends the first phase of the Mesopotamian Campaign. Hitherto it had been entirely successful at slight cost to ourselves. The greater part of the 38th division has been destroyed : about 1,200 prisoners and 21 guns had been captured: the port of Mesopotamia secured: and the oil refineries at Abadan were safe. By the first week in December the 17th Infantry Brigade and the remainder of the divisional troops had disembarked at Basra. The 6th (Poona) Division was now complete as regards its combatant personnel. The transport situation is now interesting. By the middle of Decem ber there were 5 Mule Corps with the Force totalling 3,220 mules. In addition there was the Jaipur Cart Transport Train , an Imperial Service unit with 360 carts. As regards camels there were about 1,625 from the 52nd Camel Corps, the Kalat State Camel Corps and other Indian State Camel Corps. An Indian Division in those days required as ec attached transport ' :•— 274 A. T. Carts 3,115 mules and 3,125 camels. On the 2nd December 1914 General Barrett telegraphed to India for permission to return all the camels except 300 with the force. The camels were apparently not found satisfactory in Basra. It was diffi cult to find grazing ground. In the same telegram General Barrett mentioned that it was improb able that his force would make large movements by land. Permission to return the camels was given. The 6th Division accordingly became immobile for operations on land as there was a deficiency of over 2,800 camels The shortage of land transport existed up till the attempts to relieve Kut and as we will see later seriously handicapped our tactical operations.11 Kiver transport was even more important. The transport available at the time of the capture of Basra was— 3 steamers Mejidieh, Julnar, Salimi and 17 lighters. These sufficed only to carry 2 battalions with supplies for one week. On the 23rd November 1914 a R. I. M. officer with the Force recom mended the immediate order of 12 steamers of the Mejidieh class. Tlii&amp; was not considered an urgent matter and the proposal was dropped. According to the Mesopotamia Commission General Barrett realized at this time that the Force might have to advance as far as Amara and Nasiriya. If he realized this his staff must have known it. They seem therefore to have displayed a lack of foresight in this most important matter of river transport. We have already seen that even at this stage the division as a whole was immobile on land. It was equally immobile on the river.CHAPTER H. The Turkish attempt to recapture Basra, December 1914—April 1915. The next period of the campaign from the 9th December 1914 to the 14th April 1915-that is to say to the battle of Shaiba,—is concerned with the Turkish attempt to recapture Basra. During the early part of this period, the main Turkish force was opposite Qurna. Later on, they sent a few troops towards Ahwaz. It gradually became evident that their main force was coming down from Nasiriya towards the west of Basra. The information obtained by our Intelligence at this time tended to exaggerate the forces that were being brought to Mesopotamia. This information was obtained not only from our own agents, etc., in Meso potamia, but also from the Egyptian front and from our military attache with the Russian army in the Caucasus. It was thought, at various times, that not only were the 36th and 37th Divisions coming down to Meso potamia but thfit the 24th and 26th Divisions, the two latter first class fighting material, were on their way. This information proved not to be true. What actually happened was thtt the 35th Division came down to Baghdad and thence to Nasir- lya. From this place the 35th Division (less the 103rd Regiment sent to Qurna) advanced to Nukhaila and Barjisiya wood, some 6 miles west of Shaiba. The only reinforcements sent from Anatolia were the 2 battlions of the Fire Brigade, who started from Constantinople on the 22nd November 1914. During January 1915, disquieting reports were received from Alwaz of the advance of the Turks in that direction. The advance of these troops and the fact that a 'Jehad' had been proclaimed had a dis tinctly unsettling effect on the Arab tribes in that direction. It was decided to reinforce Force ' D ' by another brigade. This was the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade (H. Q. Nasirabad). Before they arrived in Mesopotamia, the situation seemed so serious that 1 battalion of the 18th Brigade (7th Rajputs) was despatched to Ahwaz. General Barrett was anxious to avoid detachments, but it was felt that, if some British troops were not soon despatched to Ahwaz, the tribesmen, under the control of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who were already wavering would throw in their lot with the Turks. About the first week in February a Turkish attack on Qurna was still expected. At this place were the 17th and 18th Brigades and other troops, totalling 9| battalions, 2 squadrons and 22 guns The 16th Brigade less detachments, and the 12th Brigade (less 1 battalion at Qurna) were located at Basra. There was a small detachment at Shaiba ( 12 )13 consisting of 2 squadrons cavalry and half a battalion. In the middle of February, the 4th Rajputs (12th Brigade), 2 mountain guns and 30 Babres were despatched to Ahwaz. The composition of this little detachment was interesting. It com prised 2 battalions—one from the 18th Brigade—one from the 12th Brigade: a small detachment of 30 rifles from the Dorsetshire Regiment (16th Brigade) : 2 mountain guns and 1 section S. and M., the whole commanded by the C. R. A. (Brigadier-General Robinson). Sub sequently one section of R. F. A. was also sent. This provides another remarkable example of breaking organization. It may have been that such a composition was unavoidable. This force suffered a reverse early in March. While it is not suggested that this reverse was due to the mixed composition of the detachment, it is as well to point out that troops are not given the best chance of victory in such circumstances. About the middle of February 1915, the Government of India decided to increase the cavalry with Force ' D The 16th Cavalry were sent out ; the 7th Lancers followed later. It was determined to send a Brigadier-General and a Cavalry Brigade Staff : and a R. H. A. battery ( £C S ' Battery). It was an improvised cavalry brigade. The units liad not worked with each other in peace, nor had they been trained in peace by the Brigadier. The floods had now begun to make their appearance. The country around Qurna became so flooded that it was fairly obvious that the 'Turks could not make a serious attack in this direction. Lieut.-General Sir P. H. Lake, k.c.b., k.c.m.g ., theC. G. S. in India, isent a personal telegram to General Barrett to the effect that it appeared, tfrom his dispositions, that he was dispersing his force too much and impressing on him that the safety of Basra came first and that the protection of Ahwaz was a secondary objective. 'General Barrett replied to this on the 17th February, ile pointed out that the detachment at Ahwaz had been sent there partly to stop the religious movement spreading among the Sheikh of Mohammerah's followers, and to keep these latter from wavering in their allegiance. He fully endorsed the C. G. S.'s views as regards the safety of Ahwaz being a secondary object. He ended up by saying that, as the vicinity of Qurna was now flooded, he proposed to withdraw all available troops ifrom there to Basra. Even at this early stage, the want of river transport was severely felt. General Barrett stated that more steamers were urgently required. The strength of I. E. F. a D ' at the end of February 1915 was :— 13,500 rifles, 900 sabres, and 40 guns. On the 3rd March, the small force at Ahwaz moved out to deal with a concentration of tribesmen. The force was severely handled and had14 to withdraw with the loss of 1 field gun, and the breech and chase of a. mountain g un. The 4th Rajputs suffered heavy casualties among their British officers, and it was upon this occasion that soldiers of the Dorset shire Regiment detachment took command of Indian companies and brought them out to action. As a result of this reverse, the 12th Brigade was despatched to Ahwaz der Brigadier-General K. S. Davison, c.b . In the meantime the Turkish force intended for the recapture of Basra was gradually concen- tratmg at Nasmya. This force was termed the ' Right Wing Command ' nel i Commmdev m Mesopotamia at this time was Lieutenant-Colo nel Sulaiman Askan. This was the man, who has been previouslv mentioned as having proceeded to Mesopotamia with the Osmaniik battalion of ' Fidais.' Sulaiman Askari seems to have been aTut hearted man. He had had an adventurous career in chasing and round- th! R P lt g w an !

Is waTusuaJ possibk^Hence^ ' ^ ^ Sent aS far fr0m Const ^tinopIe as possible. Hence his appearance m Mesopotamia. Sulaiman Askari had succeeded to the command after the capture of Qurna, when the Commander of the 38th Division surrendered. Subsequently he was wounded severely in the knee during an attack at Qurna, and returned to Baghdad. The War Office sent down another er to command, but Sulaiman Askari refused to hand over and proceeded down to Nasiriya in a litter. He continued to clmmand ill after the battle of Shaiba, still confined to his litter: and ended career by shooting himself after the battle. The Right Winer Com mand was collected at Nasiriya by the 28th March. It consisted^ the 35th Division (less 1 regiment), the Fire Brigade, the 1st Muratteb bat were Anatohan Turks. There wp ™ 97 t ' nearly MM} .W were . ,. tg e .„ mb , r o( Zb^ele ° p S w S. m': r many desertio '' At ^ lad been over 18 '£ STT' Tr' before (iere ia the Arabs, but at .be critical Basra the following i ^concentrated m the vicinity o£ 16th Brigade. 18th Brigade (less 1 Battalion at Ahwaz), •15 One Battalion 17th Brigade. 10th Brigade R. F. A. (less 82nd Battery at Qurna). No. 1 Mountain Artillery Brigade. 17th and 22nd Companies S. &amp; M. 48th Pioneers. 34th Divisional Signal Company. The majority of these troops were concentrated in an entrenched- camp at Shaiba, to meet the Turkish advance. Shaiba lies about 9 miles south-west of the Zubair Gate of Basra. Description of the Basra Town is inland from the river. Ashar is ground. the name of the suburb on the river. Between Basra and Shaiba is a tract of low-lying ground, which in 1915 was flooded. The water is the overflow from the new channel of the Euphrates, which joins the Shatt-al-Arab at Kurmat Ali, 6 miles above Ashar. After the experience of 1915, an embankment some 8 feet high was built across this low-lying ground to prevent the encroach ment of the floods. This tract of ground is now always free from floods. At the Shaiba end of this tract, the ground rises sharply for a few feet, like the bank of a river. The spot to which the water rose in 1915 can easily be recognized on the ground now. Across the flooded area, as it was in 1915, there were two ways : one was to wade across the flood, which varied from 1 foot to 4 feet deep, to near Zubair (6 miles) : thence 4 miles by land to Shaiba, along the edge of the flood. The other was to cross in 44 bellums 55 direct to Shaiba. This involved a journey of nearly 9 miles. It could not be waded : for there was a creek which had to be crossed, impossible for men on foot to negotiate. At Shaiba, where our entrenched camp was situated, there are a few buildings and groves of tamarisk trees. Shaiba fort, which was included in our front line, lay some 600 yards from the edge of the flood. Three or four hundred yards to the North of the Fort was a disused' brick kiln, a very good 0. P. some 40 feet high. This was also in cluded in our front line. From the kiln, the line ran east to the flood. On the other side of the Fort, our trenches ran south for some three hundred yards, and thence east back to the edge of the flood. The perimeter thus ran round 3 sides of a rectangle, on the 4th side was the flood. Barbed wire entanglements ran all round the perimeter. Such was our defensive position at Shaiba. It was, in fact, a perimeter camp on a large scale. There was only one line of trenches : there was no depth in the position. There was a certain amount of cover in the interior of the camp from small sand dunes and tamarisk groves. In the latter, the horse lines of the Cavalry Brigade were situated. Barjisiya Wood, where the Turkish camp was located during the fighting, lies 6 miles south-west of Shaiba fort. The wood consists of16 OA v ^ narrow belt of tamarisk trees some 2 miles long running roughly North and South. From Shaiba, the ground rises very slightly to a crest some 2 miles from our defences. This ridge is now occupied by the aerodrome and quarters of a Squadron E. A. F. From this crest the ground slopes down again gradually to the wood. The above is the general lie of the ground. The actual terrain is slightly undulating, broken occasionally by a small mound. The surface is devoid of cover, except for a few small and scattered bushes, and is covered with very small stones, as if a thin layer of gravel had been spread. The flooded area which ran northwards from Shaiba for some distance, curved round towards the West and a small bay or creek, if one can call it so, came up to within a mile of the northern edge of Barjisiya Wood. This bit of water or mud had a considerable effect on the action of our cavalry on the 14th April. The Turks in their advance from Nasiriya established food depots at Khamasiya, Ghabishiya and Nukhaila, distant respectively from Shaiba 80, 40 and 14 miles. They wished to attack the British from a position, which was closer than Nukhaila. Water was the chief difficulty. There was only water at Barjisiya and Zubair. The former was the better. It was to this place, then, that they eventually advanced prior to the attack. During their concentration at Nasiriya, Nukhaila was held as a covering position. During the Turkish advance, their line of communication was dis turbed by what was known as the Euphrates blockade flotilla. This consisted of small steamers, armed launches and gun barges on whicli wrere mounted an assorted armament :— Naval guns : 2—4•7 ,, : 1—12-pr. : 3—3 prs. Army guns : 1—5' : l~18-pr. The flotilla did a good deal of damage to the Turks' mahelas and caused them to remove their dump at Ghabishiya 1 or 2 miles inland. The work of this flotilla probably delayed the Turks in their advance. On April 1st, 1915, the Government of India decided to reorganize the force in Mesopotamia. The 2nd Indian Army Corps was formed, under the command of General Sir John Nixon, k.c.b. By the beginning of April, 2 more Infantry brigades had arrived in Mesopotamia : the 30th Brigade from Egypt, and the 33rd Brigade tfrom India. These two Brigades with the 12th Brigade, already in the country, were formed into the 12th Division under command of Major- Creneral G. F. Gorringe, c.b., c.m.g., d.s.o . The 12th Division was really ^ division in name only. In practice, it was a reinforcement of infantry. It is true that it was allotted 2 Sapper and Miner Companies, and mominally some artillery. There was no cavalry regiment and no pioneer battalion, and no proper medical organization.17 The artillery consisted of one mobile 4 gun battery : the l/5th Hants, Howitzer Battery K. F. A. (T.F.) 5'' Hows. The other 2 batteries were 4 gun garrison artillery batteries—one armed with 5-inch guns and the other with 4-inch guns. These could hardly be considered mobile. When the 12th Division was ordered to undertake an operation, a considerable portion of the divisional troops of the 6th Division had to be allotted to it, especially artillery. Thus the two divisions were unable to undertake simultaneous operations with a proper proportion of Divisional Troops. By the 4th April, the Turkish force had reached Ghabishiya. On the 8th, Nukhaila was reached. Here 10 days'rations were dumped. On the night of the 10th April, the Turks advanced towards Barjisiya in 2 columns. Our cavalry reported this at 0700 on the 11th. In the afternoon our patrols were driven back by hostile cavalry. The cavalry brigade moved out at 1600 but the enemy withdrew to Barji- siya wood. Our intelligence put the enemy force at 12,000 regulars, 10,000 tribesmen, 12 guns. This, actually, was an over-estimate, by double, of the regulars, while the guns were under-estimated. It was also thought that the enemy plan of attack was as follows • An attack by regulars on the Fort. Attacks by tribesmen on either flank. This information was good and was what the Turks intended. As already stated, our defences were in the form of a large perimeter camp. There w T ere strong points at intervals. Some 8 or 10 piquets were posted outside the perimeter at distances varying from 800 to 300 yards. The garrison settled down in their alarm posts for the night of the ll/12th. The expected attack began at about 0500 on the 12th. It was chiefly a fire attack from some distance. Between 0700 and 0800 the enemy who had advanced up to about 900 yards from the defences, withdrew, leaving small parties in observation. The north mound, a, hillock some 900 yards north of the defences, was, occupied by a large force of Arabs. They remained here all day and the following night. On the south side of the defences, nothing of note occurred except sniping. This was worrying the artillery O. P.'s. One squadron of the 7th Lancers ■sallied out and charging home, did considerable damage. This was quite a good example of a successful mounted attack against inferior infantry, but the use of cavalry for such a purpose, in view of the limited number available, is open to question. Throughout the day the Turkish guns fired intermittently on our position, but with little effect. Another attack started at dusk, but soon faded away. During the night (12/13th), the Turks attempted to advance in various places, in some cases getting close enough to enable them to shout out in18 Hindustani 44 Do not fire.' Firing died away about 0330, 13th April. In the meantime the 30th Brigade and 30th Mountain Battery had been attempting to cross the flooded area, in order to reinforce Shaiba. The first attempt was made by wading towards Zubair, but the Mountain Battery was soon in difficulties, and the enemy were seen to be in possession of Zubair. The Brigade accordingly retraced its steps, and efforts were made to collect ' bellums ' and cross by the direct route. Only sufficient bellums were obtained to carry the H. Q. of the 6th Division, H. Q. of the Brigade and the 24th Punjabis (less 1 company). The bellumchis or rowers refused to work : volunteers from the 20th Punjabis were obtained to pole the boats. The convoy eventually arrived in Shaiba between 2030 and midnight. Major-General Melliss, the Commander of the 30th Brigade, being the senior officer, now took command of the Force. The 6th Divisional Staff, which hitherto had been in Basra, assisted hfm. On the morning of the 13th, the 6th Cavalry Brigade moved out to ascertain the strength and dispositions of the enemy to the west and north-west of the position. The enemy were found holding the north mound and adjacent houses strongly. A squadron of the 7th Lancers attempted to gallop the mound. This was the same squadron that had made the mounted attack on the previous day. The enemy were dug in on the mound. It was not an occasion for a small unsupported mounted attack. It is noteworthy that only one squadron was ordered to make a mounted attack, whereas a whole cavalry brigade was present. Ihe attack was doomed to failure. The squadron leader and his senior Indian officer gallantly galloped on and reached the mound alone. Both were killed. Major Wheeler was awarded the Victoria Cross. The Cavalry Brigade then withdrew to camp. Later the 16th Bri gade (less 2 battalions) supported by the 63rd and 76th Batteries R. F. A. and with the addition of the 24th Punjabis attacked and took the north mound, inflicting heavy loss on the Muratteb Iraq Regiment, 90 dead bodies being found on the mound. More unbroken enemy were now seen south-west of the camp. These were probably some of the Tire Brigade, who had not received the order to retire to Barjisiya, which had by now been issued by Sulaiman Askari. The 16th Brigade was ordered to make a left wheel, pivoting on the north mound. 1^ Battalions of the 18th Brigade prolonged the lire to the left. The enemy were driven from the rifle pits they had constructed, and 2 mountain guns were captured. The Cavalry Brigade operating on the right flank now succeeded in charging the retreating enemy and accounted for 100—150.19 At this stage, General Melliss ordered a withdrawal to the defences, as the troops had been under arms the whole of the previous night. The enemy casualties were estimated at 1,000 ; 400 prisoners and 2 guns were captured. The ensuing night was quite peaceful; as the Turks had withdrawn to Barjisiya wood. There was no sniping or shell fire. Soon after dawn on the 14th April, General Melliss went to the top of the kiln and observed considerable bodies of the enemy in the direc tion of South mound, some 2J miles south-west of Shaiba. « The exact whereabouts of the enemy's main forces was uncertain. General Melliss determined to seek out the enemy who had, he con sidered, been shaken by the fighting on the two previous days. Judging from the Turkish accounts he was correct in his assumption. The force moved out towards the South mound at 0900. The S. &amp; M. Companies were attached to Brigades and were used as infantry. The 104th Eifies, 48th Pioneers and 3 guns E. F. A. were left in camp as a garrison. The troops carried 200 rounds on the man ; the transport consisted of mules for 100 rounds per man and the water pakhals. The 16th Brigade were directed on the South mound, with the 18th Brigade refused on the left flank, the G. O. C. being apprehensive of an attack from the direction of Zubair. Brigades advanced on a 2 battalion front (600 yards per Battalion) ; all battalions were in artillery formation—line of f companies * in fours. The Cavalry Brigade moved wide on the flank of the 16th Brigade with 2 troops on the left flank. The Field Artillery moved in rear of the centre. Divisional H. Q. was with the guns. A few mounted men withdrew on the British advancing. South mound was occupied at 1130. Divisional H. Q. was established here. , It now became apparent to Divisional Headquarters that the enemy were not towards Zubair but were in the direction of Barjisiya Wood. Two Battalions of the 18th Brigade were countermarched from the left to the right of the 16th Brigade. The remaining Battalion remained echelonned on the left of the 16th Brigade. General Melliss then rode off towards the Cavalry and endeavoured to make a personal reconnaissance. He was able to locate roughly the right flank of the enemy, which was somewhat west of the watch tower. The enemy's left flank could not be located : nor could any of his trenches be seen. ♦The old 8 Company organization still in force.20 The watch tower was a good landmark. It has now fallen into ruins. From the slight mound, on which the tower was built, a good view can be obtained of the right and centre of the Turkish position. General Melliss' plan was to hold the enemy with the 16th Brigade, while, with the 18th Brigade, he drove back the enemy's left and threat ened their line of retreat to Nukhaila. This place lay to the left rear of their left flank. The Cavalry were unable to work round this flank, owing to flooded ground and mud. The advance started when the 18th Brigade had moved into their new position. General Melliss' intention and plan did not percolate down to regi mental officers. No information was received by regimental officers as to the position of the enemy. Battalions advanced on a limited frontage. The left of the 16th Brigade was directed on the watch tower. The Turkish trenches were well sited. As already mentioned, the ground slopes down towards the Barjisiya Wood : the enemy position was located on the reverse slope and some 12 to 1,400 yards in front of the wood. Thus the enemy could not be seen until our troops came forward over the rise. When this occurred, very heavy fire was met, at ranges varying from 900 to 400 yards. It was at this period that the majority of our casualties took place. The advance was slow after this as it was still practically impossible to see the Turkish trenches, and the mirage was heavy. It had been discovered by this time that the Turkish line consider ably overlapped ours to the West. Battalions in rear came up on the right of their respective brigades. Eventually the whole force was in line, with only 1 double company in reserve. The artillery advanced in close support of the infantry and did great execution. At 1615, covered by the artillery, the infantry made a final dash at the trenches with the bayonet. The Turks now gave up and fled towards the wood. Quite a number came back and sur rendered. It was considered necessary to withdraw to Shaiba for the night. In view of this eventuality, the 48th Pioneers were ordered out to the South mound as a support. The Jaipur Cart transport train was also ordered out at 1600, to help in the evacuation of the wounded. It was said that these caits appeared, in the mirage, to the Turks as a fresh column coming out to reinforce the British, and that this was the deciding factor in their retirement. The truth probably was that the Ist Muratteb Battalion and the Fire Brigade, on the right and centre respectively of the Turkish position, were running short of ammunition. Men could not be found to take out the ammunition from Barjisiya across the fire swept zone between the wood and the Turkish trenches.21 In such circumstances it was natural for the Turks to give way when they saw the final British advance. According to Turkish accounts, it was the 1st Muratteb Battalion, opposite the 16th Brigade, who first gave way. The 104th Regiment on the Turkish left was apparently not engaged seriously throughout the day. The result of our withdrawal to camp was that the Turks were: enabled to retire unmolested. They got most of the guns away on the evening of the 14th and the remainder during the night. The Cavalry went out to Barjisiya the next morning, and collected a certain amount of ammunition. They also visited Nukhaila on the 18th, and destroyed a small amount of material. Our casualties in the 3 days' fighting amounted to 1,257. The Turks lost 18 officers and 724 0. E. prisoners. 2 guns (Moun tain), 1,600 shells and 380,000 rounds S. A. A. were captured. The Turkish casualties among the regular troops amounted to 54 officers and 2,381 other ranks. These figures do not include the slightly wounded. The results of the 3 days' fighting round Shaiba were all that could be desired strategically. The Turks withdrew as fast as they could to Nasiriya harried by their erstwhile friends the Arabs. The attempt to recapture Basra had definitely failed. It was unfor tunate, however, that there was no pursuit, and that the Turks were enabled to remove all their guns after the action on the 14th. Throughout the 3 days' fighting, the British acted as if they were a beleaguered force, making sorties, but withdrawing to their defences every evening. This was the intention on the 14th. The message: issued for the sally on the 14th definitely stated that the troops would be back in the evening. In other words, we seem to have been con tent to parry the Turkish thrust, and only to make a very local and temporary counter-offensive. There was, however, one reason why the British could not follow up the Turks. This was lack of transport. The force was not mobile. This shortage of transport was an evil, which existed in the early days and continued till the War Office took over the management of the campaign. The question of the cavalry is touched on later. The British force on the 14th numbered 6,156 all ranks, slightly inferior to the numbers of the Turkish regular troops. In addition to the latter were numbers of 'Arabs. These hung about the battlefield ready to complete the rout of the British, if the Turka were victorious ; ready, on the other hand, to loot the Turks, should they be defeated. On the 14th, a mass of Arabs was seen on the high22 ground behind the Barjisiya wood, waiting on events. Their attitude is much like that of the North-West Frontier tribesmen, in the case of a war with Afghanistan. The best way of dealing with this menace ^f Arabs or tribesmen is to defeat the opposing regular nucleus. Then jbhe former will give little or no serious trouble. The battle of Shaiba, although it occurred during the great war, belongs, in a sense, to a bye-gone period, because there were no aero planes. 5 As a result of the lack of this essential arm, knowledge of the enemy's dispositions was almost entirely lacking. All that was known was that the bulk of the enemy's forces was in a certain direction. One flank was more or less fixed ; the other was not discovered until the troops had been committed to the fight. The difficulties of personal land reconnaissance in Mesopotamia are immense, owing to the distorting effect of the mirage. It was the ignorance of the enemy's dispositions and of the position .qf his trenches that caused our battle line to become more and more ex tended, until there wa^ no depth in the attack, and only 1 company in reserve. As regards the employment of the Sappers and Miners and Pioneers, ^we again see them being employed as fighting troops. In the action of the Hth, the S. &amp; M. Companies were attached, from the outset, to brigades, while in an Order of Battle compiled by the Force at this time, the Pioneer Battalion is shown as being in the 18th Brigade. This is a distinct break in organization. There was a Divisional K. E. H. Q., and the technical troops should have been employed under the D. E. C., .as he was called in those days. Situations will arise when the technical troops must be employed in the actual fight, but, on principle, this should only be done if there is a clear necessity. In any case, their position at the beginning of the fight should be in reserve. One company S. &amp; M. had 20 per cent, casualties on the 14th. It would appear probable that the Turks did not expect the British .to attack. One is led to this conclusion by the appearance of the Turkish Frenches. To call them trenches is really a euphemism. Actually they consisted of a line of shallow rifle pits, each man having dug his own shelter. These rifle pits were similar to those thrown up by the Turks when held up in front of the Shaiba defences. The shelters gave very little cover from fire and, after the fight, many Turks were found lying in their rifle pits, killed by our shrapnel. The British plan of attack is, perhaps, open to criticism. It is true that the Turkish left flank was nearest their line of retreat. But that flank was not located, whereas the right flank was located. It is sug gested that it might have been better to attack the Turkish right flank, ;and roll up the Turks into the flood.23 Another very important factcr in favour of attacking this flank was the co-operation of the cavalry. On the British right flank they had no room to manoeuvre, for they could not pass round the Turks' left because of the proximity of the flooded area. Employed as they were, they made no use of their mobility, and were tied to their ground^ with their horses far behind them. Beyond extending the line on the right they did nothing. On the other flank, well led and closely support ed by the H. A. Battery their action might have been decisive, either during the battle or in pursuit. A close inspection of the ground on this flank led one to believe that a charge, at the right time, and in suit able formation, might have rolled up the whole Turkish line from South to North. Owing to the configuration of the ground, they could have moved out of sight of the Turks, until they appeared near the Southern end of the Barjisiya Wood, and so in rear of the Turkish right flank. Even as matters were, it should have been possible to disengage the Cavalry and bring them round to the other flank. The ground was well known to the Cavalry, as they had been making frequent reconnaissances during March and April. o( 24 ) CHAPTER III. The British occupation of the' Basra Vilayet, 1915, General Sir John Nixon took over command of I. E. F. &lt;£ D ' on the 9th April 1915. General Barrett returned to India, sick. General Nixon was given a fresh set of instructions. These were given him by India, without previous reference to the Home Government. The instructions were as follows :— I. Your force is intended to retain complete control of the lower portion of Mesopotamia, comprising the Basra vilayet and including all outlets to the sea, and such portions of neigh bouring territories as may affect your operations. II. So far as you may find feasible, without prejudicing your main operations, you should endeavour to secure the safety of the oilfields, pipe line, and refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. III. After acquainting yourself with the situation on the spot, you will 'submit:— i. a plan for the effective occupation of the Basra vilayet. ii. a plan for a subsequent advance on Baghdad. IV. In all operations you will respect the neutrality of Persia, so far as military and political exigencies permit. He was also to submit reports on various points including the amount of animal transport required, the employment of a light railway, armoured motor cars, M. T., aircraft, and the adequacy and suitability of certain river transport, then en route to Mesopotamia. These instructions were posted Home to the India Office by mail, arriving on May 2nd. The Viceroy was apparently unaware of the issue of these instructions. Comparing the instructions with those issued to General Barrett (which only contemplated the occupation of Basra city and of a move ment up stream to safeguard Basra) it is clear that the scope of the campaign was greatly enlarged. For the Basra vilayet includes both Nasiriya and Amara, and extends to within a few miles of Kut. It- should be noted that the safety of the oilfields now takes second place. The situation of the Turks on the 15th April 1915 was as follows :— {a) The Turkish right wing was retreating rapidly towards Nasiriya. (b) A small force was opposite our Qurna detachment. (c) A small force was in the Ahwaz direction and was causing the tribesmen to be restless.25 Immediately after the Shaiba operations, General Nixon began to ^withdraw the troops to Basra, preparatory to a possible move towards Ahwaz. On the 19th April, the Secretary of State wired to the Viceroy that the Admiralty were becoming anxious about the oil situation, and that an immediate movement on the Karun side would be welcomed by the Home Governfrient: politically it was considered very desirable to expel the Turks from Persian Arabistan. At this date, the Secretary of State did not know of General Nixon's new instructions, which made the safety of the oil wells a subsidiary object, the main object being the control of the Basra vilayet. The Indian Government did not wish to tie General Nixon down in any way : the Secretary of State's telegram was, therefore, forwarded to General Nixon with the intimation that he was to use his own dis cretion. On the 19th April, General Nixon asked for another cavalry brigade, stating that the cavalry brigade now with the force could not meet the demands shortly to be made on that arm. A Pioneer battalion was also asked for. The request was refused : a coolie corps or Indus boatmen were offered instead of the pioneers. The Secretary of State was also informed of General Nixon's request. This drew the reply that the refusal was concurred in : and that the demand indicated an important offensive movement. No advance beyond the present theatre of operations would be sanctioned. An advance to Amara with the object of controlling the tribes between that place and the Karun, and thus adding to the safety of the pipe line, might be supported. ' Our present position is strategically a aound one, and we cannot, at present, afford to take risks by extending it unduly. In Mesopotamia a safe game must be played.' It is obvious, then, that in the minds of the Home Government, the original object of the expedition—the safety of the oil—was still para mount. Looked at from a broad point of view, it can hardly be doubted that the attitude of the Secretary of State was absolutely sound. The day after the telegram was despatched, we were to make our first landing in Gallipoli. That would be our main theatre against the Turks. There was also the Suez Canal theatre, which was probably more important than the Mesopotamian one : for the Sue74 Canal was a vital artery of our imperial communications. The Mesopotamian theatre was third in order of importance : moreover we had already attained our object in sending the expedition. Unfortunately we were encouraged by success after success steadily to increase our hold c 226 on Mesopotamia, while at the same time not increasing our means of doing so. In response to the telegram from the Secretary of State of the 19th, General Nixon, on the 21st, began to transfer troops to the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, preparatory to a move up the Karun. The force was under the command of General Gorringe who had at his dis posal his own division (less 1 Brigade already in Ahwaz), the Cavalry Brigade (less 1 regiment) and the divisional field artillery of the 6th Division—Total 8,500 rifles, 500 sabres, 23 guns. When the Secretary of State's telegram of the 19th April was for warded to General Nixon by India, an appreciation of the situation was asked for. This was wired to India on the 27th April. General Nixon considered that none of the Turkish forces were capable of undertaking an effective offensive. He thought those at Nasiriya and on the Tigris would remain where they were for the present. Nothing definite could be said about those on the Karun side, till General Gorringe arrived in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz. This was owing to the lack of Cavalry. There were only 2 troops at Ahwaz. He would have preferred to have pushed on to Nasiriya to take advantage of the enemy's disorganization after the battle of Shaiba. This course was, at present, impracticable owing to lack of land transport for the desert route, and to the failure, to date, to find a practicable channel by river. At the same time, he thought that we must eventually occupy Nasiriya, in order to control the western part of the Basra vilayet. If we delayed too long, the enemy might again become formidable in that direction. There was no urgency at present for operations against the Tigris group. In any case, much preparation would be necessary before that could be tackled. Finally he must await the result of General Gorringe's operations before making further plans. What it really amounted to was that the enemy on the Karun was the only force, at whom we could strike, at the moment. Moreover ic was most important to clear the Turks out of Persian Arabistan and pacify the country, so that pumping could be re-started at the oil wells. The Turkish forces in the Ahwaz area were thought to consist of one regular battalion, five gendarmerie battalions, one regular and re8imeBt ' eve ' ^ ^ — They do not appear to ha™ been a formidable force. But tbeir preaence enootmjged the tribes to diaobey the orders of the Sheihh of r'—,, T1 ;f news ° , the victory at Sh.iba had had LI tolfhaZ 7 ' m0 ° g ^ Beni Md th « ^27 General Gorringe's force left Basra about the 22nd April. Some marched, some went by river. The advance of this column caused the Turks to withdraw. On the 22nd, they were reported to be withdraw ing from Ghadir to the Karkha river : on the 29th they were at Ilia. On this date General Gorringe had arrived at Braika. The Turks continued to retire, and on the 1st May, it was ascertained that they had withdrawn on Bisaitin. It was now fairly obvious that General Gorringe would not be able to strike at the Turks. He had to contend with supply difficulties and could not operate for long away from the Karun. An intermediate supply depot had to be established between the Karun and the Karkha. On the 6th May, the column was concentrated at Kut-el-Hawashim. The brigade in Ahwaz (less 1 Battalion) had joined up with an impro vised bridging train. Even though the Turks could not be struck at, there were still the Beni Taruf to be punished. This tribe had added to their sins by a treacherous attack on a cavalry reconnaissance on the 29th April, in which 3 British officers were killed. Accordingly, the Karkha was crossed at Ilia, on the 7th and 8th May. The Arabs collected at Khafajiya. The Turks were reported as having retired to Umm-Chir. On the 13th, General Gorringe with the Cavalry Brigade, machine gun battery and 30th Brigade advanced 7 miles from Ilia. On the 14th, with the 2 former units, he went on to Bisaitin. There was no sign of the Turks, who had actually left that place for Amara on the 11th May. The Beni Taruf (2,000) at Khafajiya remained to be dealt with. At 1600 14th, General Melliss with the 30th Brigade attacked Khafajiya, with the co-operation of the 12th Brigade, which advanced down the left bank of the river, and of General Gorringe's cavalry reconnaissance returning from Bisaitin. The operations were continued on the 15th and 16th May, and considerable punishment inflicted on the Beni Taruf. The column marched back to Ilia on the 18th. These operations on the Karun and Karkha rivers were, as events turned out, a blow in the air. But they had the important result that pumping in the oil wells was able to be resumed on the 22nd May. The oil did not reach Abadan for some time, owing to the necessarj' repair to the pipe line which had been damaged. That the working of the oil wells was still considered a matter of primary importance at Home, is shown by the fact that the Secretary of State on the 25th May again telegraphed to make known the Admiralty's anxiety for the reopening of the supply. General Gorringe's operations in Arabistan being com pleted, General Nixon now had to decide on his further action. The lack of shallow draught steamers precluded an advance on Nasiriva. He, therefore, decided on attacking tie Turks above Qurna.28 The 30th Brigade and 63rd Battery K. F. A. were then withdrawn, to Basra. Lack of dry ground in Basra was said to be one reason for not with drawing the Cavalry Brigade. But General Nixon determined to use General Gorringe's force to demonstrate to Bisaitin, as if prepared to advance on Amara, in connection with the forthcoming operations of the 6th Division. The authorities at Home and in India seem, at this time, to have been rather at cross-purposes with regard to the role of I. E. F. ' D.' On the 23rd May, the Indian Government wired to the Secretary of State saying that Sir J. Nixon proposed to take the offensive up the Tigris at Qurna : that he would not advance beyond Amara without the Secretary of State's sanction : and requesting permission for the proposed move. On the same day the Secretary of State wired his sanction. But he appears to have been annoyed with General Nixon. ' Arrange ments for the move in question must have been made some days back, and I am of opinion that General Nixon should have submitted his pro posals before the last moment.' General Nixon was also to understand that no reinforcements were available. This was rather hard perhaps on General Nixon, who had been discussing the proposed move with India for some weeks. The two telegrams were repeated to General Nixon. He, not unna turally, thought the orders of the Secretary of State and of the Indian Government did not seem to tally. Accordingly on the 25th, he sent a long wire to India asking for definite orders as to whether the occu pation of Nasiriya and Amara was to be carried out, in order to obtain control of the Basra Vilayet; because the orders given to him on assump tion of command and the policy now laid down by the Secretary of State did not appear to agree. He ended up by stating that it was not his intention to advance beyond Nasiriya and Amara. The reply from India was to the effect that it was not considered that the orders were conflicting but rather that the Secretary of State wished to emphasise that no reinforcements would be sent. General Nixon then continued with his preparations for the Qurna poerations. The force was under the command of Major-General C. V. Townshend,, C.B., D.S.O., who had by now assumed command of the 6th Division. The country for some distance to the north of Qurna was under water. Only here and there a yellow sandhill stood up above the flood. The main Turkish position was on a sand ridge at Abu Aran, some 8 miles, from our advanced position at Qurna. In front of this position was a curtain of small islands more or less on the line of a creek known as the29 Barbukh creek. In front of this again was another island called Nor folk Hill, 1,800 yards from our position. On the left bank was One Tree Hill. The capture of this latter hill would enable enfilade fire to be brought to bear across the river upon Norfolk Hill. There was an obstruction in the river at Euta, just above Abu Aran. The Turkish force appears to have amounted to 5,200 with 10 guns. 2,000 Mujtahir were also reported to have been present. The only possible way of getting at the Turkish position was in boats—the local bellum. 10 men could be put in one bellum. 16 boats were allowed per company. Machine guns were mounted on rafts, as were the mountain guns. A considerable amount of practice was required to make a propor tion of men per battalion reasonably proficient in punting the bellums. One quarter of each battalion's bellums were armoured. This proved to be a mistake. The water was not clear and the armoured bellums could liot be propelled through the reeds. The attack was arranged for the 31st May. About the same time General Gorringe was to demonstrate to Bisaitin, as if he was going to advance thence on Amara by land. On the 29th May, General Gorringe was at Bisaitin, and his Cavalry reconnoitred to Umm Chir, about 50 miles from Amara. General Townshend's plan was to capture the Turks' positions metho dically, by stages. On the first day the 17th Brigade (less one Battalion) was to capture the advanced position on the right bank up to the line of the Barbukh creek. The remaining battalion (22nd Punjabis) was to capture One Tree Hill on the left bank. The second day, the main positions at Abu Aran was to be captured, the 22nd Punjabis joining the remainder of their brigade on the right bank. The third stage was the pursuit on ships. The 16th Brigade was to remain on board ship, till it was necessary to use it. It was hoped that it would not have to be landed before the main position at Abu Aran was attacked. The principal artillery support would be from the naval guns with the assistance of the land artillery located within our position at Qurna. For the second phase, some of the land artillery would be placed in the Turkish covering position : but the main support would again be afforded by the Naval guns. The attack began at 0500 31st May. One Tree Hill was seized without difficulty : Norfolk Hill was smothered by our artillery fire and easily captured. Fire was now concentrated on Tower Hill and Gun Hill. The Turks made very little resistance. The enemy at Gun Hill put up white flags half an hour before the attacking battalion could reach the place. Tower Hill was captured at 1130 and Gun Hillsomewhat later. The first phase was now finished. The 17th Brigade ^ bivouacked for the night in the captured position. The 22nd Punjabis were brought across the river to the right bank. ^ The orders for the 1st June were for the 17th Brigade to continue their attack m bellums on Abu Aran : the 16th Brigade still remaining ^ on their ships. At dawn the artillery opened fire and the 17th Brigade began their slow advance. There was no reply from the Turkish artillery. f An aeroplane which had come up from Basra soon reported that $ the Turks had evacuated their position. The naval flotilla then took g up the pursuit. jl The 17th Brigade was embarked on the Blosse Lynch, Mejidieh and * l[ P 1: the Norfolk Eegiment were already on P 3 : 63rd Battery E. F. A. i and 22nd Company S. &amp; M. (less 2 sections) were also on board-ship. J This force then followed the Naval flotilla. The 16th Brigade disembarked and occupied Abu Aran. By dark, the flotilla had reached Ezra's Tomb, having been in action with the Turkish gun boat Marmarice. The pursuit was continued at 0200 2nd June, when the moon rose. When light enough to see, the Mar- marice was again engaged and soon set on fire. Seven miles above Ezra's Tomb, the sloops, drawing 9 to 10 feet could proceed no further. General Townshend and the S. N. 0., then continued in the Comeb, L with Shaitan, Sumana and Lewis Pelly in attendance. Amara was reached at 1330 3rd June, when 30 officers and 700 men surren dered, including the Turkish Commander and the Governor of Amara ; a good proportion of these men belonged to the Fire Brigade, which points to great demoralization among the Turks. The leading troops of the pursuit did not reach Amara till the morning of the 4th June (0630). The capture of Amara by the G. O. C. and a few officers and men is a fine example of daring and determination in pursuit of a beaten enemy, and is an epic story in itself. On the 3rd June the Turks, withdrawing from the direction ot Bisaitin, arrived near Amara, being in ignorance of our occupation of the place. They were shelled and dispersed. Two of their guns were abandoned *• and brought in by the Arabs. By the 6th June, the 16th Brigade and other troops had arrived at Amara. The capture of Amara had now blocked the road by which the Turks could approach Ahwaz. It was determined, then, to lessen the garrison. Accordingly, the 7th Lancers, 82nd Battery, R. F. A. and 12th Brigade (less one Battalion) marched from Bisaitin to Amara. The last unit arrived on the 18th June. The heat was terrific and water difficulties great. In one unit a number of men died of thirst, owing to bad water discipline. So ended these very remarkable operations, sometimes called Town- shend s Regatta, The Turks, as may have been gathered, did not put ^31 up a good fight. Our casualties only amounted to 25, wldle our captures amoanted to 17 guns (of wHcli 5 were naval), 1,773 prisoners, apart from battle casualties. The Turks lost the gun-boat Marmarice (set on fire and sunk), the river steamer Mosul, the steamer Bulbul (sunk), and 3 other boats captured, 2 of which were used by us later. The main lesson of this 44 Regatta ' is perhaps the value of careful preparation. The artillery fire seems to have been particularly good and accurate. Very probably the Turks felt in no mood for a fight after seeing the punishment meted out to Norfolk Hill, which was somewhat in advance of their advanced position. An onlooker describes the island 150 yards long, as being entirely hidden in rolling clouds of yellow fumes, from which great mountains of earth shot up. Very few of the 200 Turks on this island survived. One might almost say that the guns, won the fight, the infantry only being required to occupy the position ■after a wearisome advance through the floods. With Amara in our possession. General Nixon had to consider his iurther plans. These he outlined in a telegram to Simla on the 11th June, in which he stated that it had been impressed on him, before he left India, that the possession of Amara and Nasiriya was necessary in order to occupy effectively the vilayet of Basra. Nasiriya was ^ place of some military and political importance. It was situated near the south end of the Hai, and was the best place from which the Turks could threaten Basra. It was one of the Headquarters of the Turkish €ivil administration, and was the place from which the powerful Munta- fiq tribe could best be controlled. General Nixon considered that the occupation of these two places would make control over the vilayet effective : the occupation of Kut would make it even more effective, but he proposed first to capture Nasiriya, and then perhaps adva*ice on Kut. Whether General Nixon's ideas at this time went beyond Kut, and whether he was eager to go on to Baghdad, we do not know. But the G. S. at Simla were in favour of this latter project early in June (8th). 4 4 So far as we can see all advantages, political and strata gical, point to as early a move on Baghdad as possible.' But it was s. matter for the Imperial Cabinet to decide. On the 14th June, it was considered that the move to Nasiriya was unnecessary, on military grounds, as necessitating a considerable detachment, in the event of an advance to Baghdad being sanctioned. On 13th June, however, the Viceroy recommended the advance to Nasiriya to the Secretary of State. But evidently the occupation of Kut was not lost sight of, and General Nixon was asked to submit an appreciation regarding the advisability of seizing and holding Kut with the forces at his disposal. No reply was received from the Secretary32 of State to the telegram of June 13th : accordmgly on June 22nd, General Nixon was authorized to begin his advance to Nasiriya, when ready. The way by water to Nasiriya lay from Qurna, along the old bed of the Euphrates to Kubaish (27 miles) : here the Hammar Lake had to be crossed to Akaika (15 miles). The Kurma Safha channel, 13 miles long and 60 to 80 yards wide, led into the main Euphrates stream about 20.miles below Nasiriya. The navigation difficulties were considerable. At first the Hammar Lake held 4 feet of water ; at the end of July but 3 feet: only small stern wheelers could then be used. After July, steamers could not be used, and troops and stores had to be poled in hel iums, which in some places had actually to be dragged across the mud. A solid dam had been constructed half a mile from the entrance to the Kurma Safha channel. General Gorringe, 12th Division, was in command. The troops allotted in the first instance were Headquarters 12th Division, 30th Brigade, ^ 48th Pioneers, 63^ Battery E. F. A., 30th Mountain Battery, 4, 4-7' guns in horse boats, 22nd Company S. &amp; M. It was found neces- sary, later, to increase this force. The movement from Qurna began on the 26th June to Chahbaish. Early on the 27th, the Flotilla began the passage of the Hammar Lake, and anchored that evening near the entrance to Kurma Safha channel, the gun boats moving up to the dam. A channel had to be blasted through the dam. By the evening of the 29th, a small channel had been made, but it was necessary to haul the ships through this channel, owing to the great rush of water. All the ships had been got through by the 3rd July. Meanwhile reconnaissances had been made of the enemy's position. It was located at the junction of the Kurma Safha channel and the Euphrates, supported by 4 guns, which covered a minefield. At 0445 5th July, the 30th Brigade advanced to the attack,, the 1/4th Hampshires and 2/7th G. R. on the right or south bank : 76th and 24th Punjabis on the left bank. The latter battalion moved in bel- lums through the inundated country beyond the belt of date palms which fringed the channel. This battalion managed to reach the left bank of the Euphrates at 1300. Having dragged their bellums for 60 yards across dry land, they were proceeding to embark, when the Turks on the other bank of the Euphrates put up the white flag and sur rendered the battery. The channel was swept for mines, and the ships moved up to the Euphrates. 132 prisoners were captured besides the 4 guns, our casualties being 111. A naval reconnaissance was now made of the enemy's main position. It was found to be astride the river about 4 to 5 miles below Nasiriya. On both banks creeks protected the position. The ground on the right33 bank was completely devoid of cover, while on the left bank, there wa&amp; a narrow belt of date groves. An obstruction had been made by the Turks some 3,000 yards down stream of their position. This did not prevent the flotilla eventually passing through. On the night 7/8th July, two Battalions on the right bank and one on the left pushed forward to cover the obstruction and prevent the Turks from improving it. General Gorringe now realized that he would require reinforcements. The 12th Brigade (less 1 Battalion) and 1 section l/5th Hants. How. Battery R.F.A. were therefore sent up. On the night of the 13/14th, a further advance on both banks was. made to about 400 yards from the enemy's advanced trenches. This, was accompanied on the right bank by an attempt to seize some sandhills situated in the middle of an inundated area, about 1,000 yards from,,, and slightly in rear of, the Turkish line. The battalion (24th Punjabis carrying out this attack, moved forward during the night in bellums and at dawn attempted to wade to the Turkish post. They were re pulsed with heavy loss, although supported by 2 sections of the 30th Mountain Battery mounted on rafts. No blame was imputed to this battalion for their failure. The plentiful artillery support available at Qurna for similar operations was not, in this case, provided. General Gorringe now asked for further reinforcements, as it was clear that the Turks were being steadily reinforced. When operations started, their numbers had been estimated at 2,000 ; they had by the 15th July, 5,000. Accordingly the remainder of the troops shown in the order of battle were sent, arriving on the 19th and 20th July, Up to and including the 23rd, preparations were made for the final attack. The jumping off trenches near the enemy were improved and extended and the guns registered on their targets. The attack began on the 24th July at 0500. On the right bank the 30th Brigade (less 1 Battalion) attacked : two Battalions attacking, with the other battalion and the Brigade M. G.'s giving covering fire from a flank. The deep Majinina creek was made fordable by a naval ship towing up a launch and placing this across the mouth of the creek, thus lowering the level of water in the channel. By 0930 the advanced position with 5 guns was in our hands. On the left bank, two Battalions, 12th Brigade, and the remaining battalion of the 30th Brigade attacked, and were equally successful. By noon the main position on both banks had been captured. The enemy still made some resistance but by about 1600 their final position was taken. The Turks did not fight badly and 500 dead were counted. Our casualties amounted to about the same figure on this day. The Turks lost 15 guns and over 1,000 prisoners.34 The troops bivouacked in tlie captured position for the night. Nasi- nya was occupied the next morning without opposition, the Turks having evacuated it and withdrawn up the Hai towards Kut. Aeroplane re connaissance on the 25th could find no enemy within striking distance. though the Turks fought quite well, these operations were really ^ est of endurance. The troops liad been engaged without cessation or 20 days. It was quite common to have a shade temperature of 113° ■wit a damp and humid atmosphere. No animals could be employed i consequently the fighting troops had to do all the handling of stores, guns and ammunition. It can safely be said that the troops put up a very fine performance under exceptionally bad conditions. It will have been observed that the attack on the 24th July was entirely frontal. This was due to the factsthat— i. On the right bank, there was a flooded area, which made any flanking or enveloping movement impossible. n. On the left bank, there was a belt of palm groves extending for some distance from the river bank. This made reconnaissance extraordinarily difficult. The G. 0. C. 30th ngade was not in favour of a flanking movement, owing to the diffi- cultj of maintaining touch and connection. We had a great preponderance in guns and machine guns, and relied largely on their covering fire to break the front.CHAPTER IV. The first British advance on Baghdad, 1915. I.— Up to Es Sinn incl. The general situation in Mesopotamia at the end of the Nasiriya operations was as follows :— At that place—2 Brigades of the 12th Division, 1 Brigade of the 6th Division, Divisional troops from both divisions. At Amara—with a small mixed detachment at Kumait (29 miles up stream) 16th Brigade (less 2 Battalions) : 17th Brigade : 7th Lancers. Remainder of 6th Division, Divisional troops, and the heavy artillery (less 1 sec.). At Ahwaz—6th Cavalry Brigade (less 1 Regiment and two troops), 1 Battalion : 1 Battery R. F. A. (76th). At Basra—Remainder of force, with a battalion at Qurna, and very small detachments at Abadan and Fao. We had, therefore, completely accomplished General Nixon's original instructions, viz,, effective occupation of the Basra vilayet, and the safety of the oil fields and refineries. As was mentioned in the previous chapter, the G. S. in India had, for some time, advocated the occupation of Kut, not only for the more effective control of the Basra vilayet, but as a step forward towards Baghdad. The appreciation asked for from General Nixon was written on the 24th June and arrived at A. H. Q., Simla, on 7th July. In this. General Nixon strongly advocated the occupation of Kut because the denial of this place to the enemy would prevent him from threatening us on two lines (Tigris and Euphrates), and permitted us to concentrate our main forces on the Tigris, leaving only a small garrison at Nasiriya to watch the local tribes and the Euphrates valley. A further reason was the desire to control the powerful Beni Lam tribe. This could not be done from Amara. No sooner, then, had Nasiriya been occupied than the Viceroy wired July 1915. to tlle S - of S ' ' As Nasiriya has now been occupied, we consider it a matter of strategic necessity that Kut should also be occupied.' Owing to sickness and to the fact that a battalion from Mesopotamia had to be sent to Bushire it was necessary to have reinforcements. It was proposed to bring the 28th Brigade from Aden, and return it thither in November. . TlieS - of S - re P lied on 30th July to the effect that the strategic importance of Kut was recognized : but that a cautious strategy was ( 35 )36 imposed on us, as the 28tli Bde. was not available, nor were any otlier Teinforcements. The suggestion was made that Nasiriya might be evacuated. A further expression of opinion was called for. On this, India wired out the S. of S.'s telegram to General Nixon. The latter replied on 2nd August, saying that his views were the same as in his appreciation of 24th June : that Nasiriya could not be complete^ abandoned, as suggested by the S. of S. He was also in favour of withdrawing the detachment at Ahwaz and of the Anglo-Persian Oil -Company giving subsidies to the local tribesmen to ensure non-inter ference with the wells. After the capture of Kut, he proposed to dispose the 6th Division with 1 Brigade in Amara, and 2 Brigades in Kut: while the 12th Division would be distributed with 1 Brigade each at Basra and Nasiriya, and the 3rd on the L. of C. This telegram was repeated to the S. of S. On the 6th August the August 1915. ^ concurred in the proposal, but was still nervous about the protection of the oil wells. On this General Nixon stated that he could not undertake to guard the oil wells and at the same time accomplish the capture of Kut. He considered an advance to Eaghdad was the best remedy for disorders in Persia. On the S. of S. being assured of the safety of the oil wells from local disorders, permission was finally given on 20th August for the advance. This correspondence has been given in a certain amount of detail: for it shows that there were still at this time rather fundamental differ ences as to the role of I. E. F. £&lt; D.' Both India and General Nixon looked forward to the capture of Baghdad ; in fact viewed the campaign, rather as an offensive one, provided small reinforcements (1 division) could be sent, to enable Baghdad to be held. The S. of S. on the other hand was trying to apply the brake, and it seems as if the safety of the oil wells (the original object of the expedition) was still considered by him to be the chief object. Looked at from the standpoint of the war as a whole, it appears that he was right. Meso potamia was a secondary theatre, and an offensive campaign was not indicated. On the 23rd August, General Townshend was handed his instructions. These stated that he was to destroy and disperse the enemy, and occupy Kut, ' thereby consolidating our control of the Basra vilayet.' After the capture of Amara, the Turks had withdrawn to the neigh bourhood of Kut. Here they were engaged in preparing a strong position some 8 miles down stream of Kut. The fugitives from Nasiriya joined the Turkish forces at this place. The Turks pushed a covering force down to Shaikh Saad. The 16th Brigade under General Delamain was sent forward as a covering force to Ali-Gharbi on the 1st August.37 On the 8th August, General Townshend submitted his plan of opera tions. At this date his force was concentrated at Amara with a Brigade group at Ali-Gharbi consisting of— H. Q. i6th Indian Infantry Brigade. 16th Infantry Brigade. 22nd Punjabis (from 17th Brigade). 82nd Battery R. F. A. 1 Sec. KHth Battery R. G. A. 7th Lancers (less 1 squadron). Engineer, Signal and ambulance detachments. General Townshend's plan was to pass the 17th Brigade through the 16th Brigade to Shaikh Saad : and to concentrate his whole force at Shaikh Saad. He then proposed to advance up the river with his whole force on the left bank. The enemy's force on the left bank was to be Tolled up, that on the right bank being ignored. The force was concentrated at Ali-Gharbi by the 11th September, with the exception of the 63rd Battery R. F. A., September 1915. ^ Hants Battery R F A and half the 30th Brigade, which were still at Amara. The force had been moved up the riverby echelons on ships, starting on 1st September. The Turks had a small detachment at Gunfad about 7 miles above Ali-Gharbi. There was a cavalry skirmish with this detachment on September 3rd : on the approach of our main forces, the Turks fell.back to Shaikh Saad. The British began the advance from Ali-Gharbi on the 12th Septem ber, part being carried on ships, but the majority (16th and 17th Brigades, 2 Batteries R. F. A., Cavalry, Pioneers and Sappers) marched up the left bank. On the 13th September, the division halted in the Musandaq reach, and the Turkish detachment evacuated Shaikh Saad and fell back on the main position at Es Sinn. The heat was very great—110° to 116°, even touching 120° in small tents. In spite of the heat and the hard work performed during the hot weather, the troops soon regained their vigour at the prospect of action. On the 12th September, 67 men fell out: on the 13th, 23 : after this none fell out. The force marched only from dawn to 0830 daily. By the 15th September, Abu Rumman was reached. Here the Divi sion bivouacked on the right bank. This was necessary as the ship flotilla had to mooron the right bank. Here the Division remained until the 26th September. The delay was due to the fact that 2 Batteries (63rd R. F. A. and l-5th Hants Battery) had not yet arrived. These Batteries joined on the 25th Sep tember.38 The strength of the force was :—(Order of Battle in Appendix IV). 11,103 ; consisting of 3,148 British and 7,955 Indian, with 32 guns^ of which 22 were mobile on land. The Turkish force opposed to General Towshend consisted of some 6,000 rifles of the 35th and 38th Divisions with 38 guns. The Turkish position was constructed on both banks of the Tigris.* On the right bank, it ran along the feature known as the Sinn Banks. This was really the remains of an old canal embankment. The position extended for some 3| miles to what was known later as the Sinn Abtar Eedoubt. The Dujaila position was not, at this time, entrenched. On the left bank, the position extended for some 6 miles inland from the river. The chief feature on the left bank were the marshes. The large Suwaikiya marsh comes to within 1 mile of the Tigris opposite Hanna andFallahiya; from here it diverges from the Tigris, till, in continuation of the Turkish position on the north bank, it was about 8 miles distant from the river. This space of 8 miles is broken by 3 marshes :— i. The Horse Shoe Marsh, a small marsh less than | mile wide, with a small hillock close and on the river side of it, distant about f mile from the Tigris. ii. The Suwada Marsh, If miles from the Horse Shoe Marsh. This marsh was 4J miles long and 2 miles wide. The length of it runs almost east and west. The eastern edge extended about 2| miles beyond the Turkish position, coming almost level with the Chahela Mounds on the Tigris. It cut the Turkish position on the left bank into two parts. iii. The Ataba Marsh, 2 miles from the Suwada Marsh. At this time the Ataba Marsh had a circumference of about 8 miles,, although it was dry in the following March. It is only during the flood season that the marsh approaches the Tigris so closely at Hanna and Sannaiyat. In September 1915, the marsh at Sannaiyat was probably consider ably further from the river. Thi^ might account for two facts :— i. That the Turks did not, at this time, hold the Sannaiyat defile. ii. That General Townshend was unaware that there would be a defile here during the flood season. If he had realised this, it is possible that he might have considered withdrawing to this position in December 1915 instead of shutting himself up in Kut. In November 1923, when the country was visited by the Staff College the Suwaikiya marsh was dry, and no obstacle to the passage of troops guns, etc. * See sketch map T. C. 439 The Turks had entrenched the spaces between the marshes up to the Ataba Marsh. The fire trenches were deep and narrow, and provided with loopholes. The communication trenches were deep. Most of the front was protected by wire entanglements, not in all cases made of barbed wire. Some of these wire entanglements were hidden from view by being sunk in depressions. There were lines of deep pits containing sharpened stakes. Contact mines had also been laid. The Turks had a second line of trenches about 1,000 yards in rear of their front line. The river, where the entrenched lines approached the banks, was blocked by what was thought to be a boom. This was subsequently discovered to be a flying bridge consisting of an iron lighter running on chains. The ground in front of the position was absolutely flat, except for a few sandhills. There were no trees or high scrub. In short, the field of fire was as good as possible. Water was pumped into various parts of the position, by means of ■oil engine pumps installed on the river bank. In addition to the fly ing bridge mentioned above, the Turks had a boat bridge about 2J miles, as the crow flies, below Kut. Surprise and deception was the main feature of General Townshend's plan. Hitherto, the element of surprise had hardly entered into the British plans of attack. At Shaiba, the British had not gone out with the idea of having a serious fight with the Turks. The battle ' happened.' It was a true encounter battle. At Qurna, the nature of the ground had prevented anything in the shape of a turning attack. At Nasiriya, the attack was made on both banks of the river, the Turkish position being approached gradually and methodically. General Townshend determined to ignore the Turkish forces on the right bank, and to destroy those on the left bank. From the information at his disposal, he knew that the Turkish forces were distributed on both sides of the river. The position of the •Suwada Marsh, jutting out, as it did, like a great promontory from the Turkish position, favoured an attack on the left bank. The Turks between the Suwada Marsh and the Tigris could be held with compara tively small forces, while the main strength was thrown on that portion of the position between the Suwada and Ataba Marshes. A serious disadvantage under which General Townshend laboured, was the lack of land transport. On the 31st August, 450 pack mules, 150 carts and 300 draught mules were required to complete the 1st line transport, and to enable the reserve ammunition and 1 day's supplies to be carried on the 2nd line transport. When operations started, the force was 300 mules short of what was required. The result was that practically all the land transport was D40 allotted to the turning column. Even then, there were no water carts, and no arrangements could be made for carrying additional drinking water. As the Turkish forces were divided on both banks of the river, General Townshend determined to try and induce the Turkish Commander to retain those on the right bank on that bank as long as possible. His plan was as follows :— The force was to be divided into two columns, A and B.'' Column A consisted of— 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades. 30th Infantry Brigade (less 2| Battalions). 10th Brigade R.F.A. (less 1 Battery). l-5th Hants Battery R.F.A. (T.F.). D.A.C. (land section). 22nd Company S. &amp; M. Maxim Battery. 7 th and 16th Cavalry. Ambulance units. This column was destined for the turning movement, less the 30th Infantry Brigade. Column B consisted of— 18th Infantry Brigade. Heavy Artillery. 63rd Battery R.F.A. 48th Pioneers. 17th Company S. &amp; M. D.A.C. (river section). This column was destined for the subsidiary attack. On the 26th September, the advance was to be begun from Abu Rumman, Column A marching up the right bank to the Chahela mounds and opposite Nukhailat. Column Bin ships (less 63rd Battery R.F.A. and 48th Pioneers by land) was to disembark at Nukhailat. Column A was then to demonstrate, on the 27th September, beyond the Chahela mounds, while Column B advanced up the left bank. In the meantime the bridge would be brought up from Abu Rummani and constructed at Nukhailat. Column A (less 30th Brigade) was then to cross at dusk and carry out a night march, so as to place itself opposite the Turkish trenches just south of the Ataba marsh, i .e., the extreme left of the Turkish position. At dawn on the 28th September, these trenches were to be assaulted and the column would then sweep on towards the river. Column B pressing home an a sault on the trenches between the Suwada marsh41 and the Tigris. It was intended to carry out the pursuit on ships by means of Column B. About 0500 the advance from Abu Rumman began. Column A marched up the right bank and camped behind E September.^ ^i La i ]Le l a mounds. During the afternoon, the 103rd Mahratta L. I. advanced to some sandhills^ 2 miles up stream of Chahela, and there dug themselves in. Column B disembarked on the left bank at Nukhailat. On arrival at Nukhailat, the 48th Pioneers installed the 86th and 104:th Batteries (less 1 section) in positions near the river bank, and some 5,000 yards distant from the enemy front line. The 104:th Rifles from Column A had marched by the left bank and then proceeded to a point at the eastern edge of the Suwada marsh, to guard the defile between the Suwada and Suwaikiya marshes. This post was known as Clery's post. The boat bridge at Abu Rumman was dismantled and brought forward to Nukhailat. Here the bridge was again constructed, at a previously reconnoitred spot, where it was out of sight of the Turks and out of range of their shrapnel. During the afternoon, the Turks shelled the Chahela mounds, the range to which they had previously registered. No damage was done. The shipping was moored below the bridge. An observation tower was erected for the G. O. C. just behind the heavy gun positionsr on the left bank. This was Divisional H. Q. during the battle. During the morning, all the hired transport of the Force crossed to the left bank, in order to be out of the way of the EVe Septeniber 27tl1 fighting troops, who were to cross later in the day. On the right bank, the 103rd Mahratta L. I. returned to the Chahela mounds from their advanced position, about mid-day. At 1600 the 16th Brigade and 30th Brigade (less 2^ Battalions) marched forward from the Chahela mounds to a position on some sandhills, 2 miles up stream of Chahela. Here they proceeded to dig in, throwing the earth about as much as possible, so as to make a great display. At dusk, the 16th Brigade returned to the Chahela mounds and crossed the river to the left bank, after the remainder of the force had crossed. This crossing began at 1630 and was completed by 2130. Earth was laid on the bridge, to muffle the sound of wheels on the roadway. The 30th Brigade remained in their advanced position on the right bank. During the day, Column B advanced from Nukhailat under artillery fire, and supported by our heavy artillery. They occupied and en- trenched a position about 3,500 yards from the Turkish front line. This was roughly level with the 30th Brigade on the other bank of the river. D 242 Column B during the night of the 27th-28th made a night advance and installed themselves in a convenient nullah about 1,200 yards from the Turkish front line. At 2230 Column A commenced its night march from the vicinity of Nukhailat, making in the first instance for Clery's post. Events of the 28th rm-„ _ n September. was &lt; ^ a y niam battle. We left Column B in a position, after a night advance, about 1,200 yards from the Turkish position between the Suwada marsh and Tigris. We left Column A moving from Nukhailat towards Clery's post. This place was reached about mid-night 27th-28th. Here a halt of 2 hours was made. The 104th Eifles from Clery's post joined its own brigade, the 16th, and was relieved by 2 Companies 117th Mahrattas from the same brigade. About 0200 28th5 the advance was resumed. The column was guided by Lieutenant A. B. Mathews, K.E. The route led along the eastern edge of the Suwada marsh ; thence north-west through the defile between the Suwada and Suwaikiya marshes. At 0500 the Column reached a point near the Suwaikiya marsh, 3 miles from Clery's post and 2 miles from the left of the Turkish position, which lay in a south-west direction. This was the position of deployment. From here the column was to advance and capture the redoubt on the extreme left of the Turkish position, situated not far from the Ataba marsh. According to the rough time table of the battle, this was to be captured by 0900. The orders issued by General Delamain were as follows :— The 17th Brigade and 2 battalions of the 16th Brigade (20th Punjabis, 104th Rifles) and the 76th Battery H. F. A. were to form the assaulting force under the command of Brigadier-aeneral F. A. Hoghton (17th Brigade). The remainder of the column (H. Q. 16th Brigade the remaining 1| battalions of that Brigade—Dorsetshire, 117th Mahrattas (less 2 Companies), 82nd Battery, l-5th Hants Battery R. F. A. ; 22nd Company S. &amp; M., Machine Gun Battery) was to follow General Hogh ton and form the General Reserve. Shortly before 0700 General Hoghton's force began to advance. Previous to this, the column had been fired on by a line of skirmishers in advance of the main enemy position. The Turks, at this hour, then, were aware of the threat to their left and commenced to reinforce this part of their position. After General Hoghton had advanced a short distance his force was seen suddenly to turn off to the right or north. The Turkish skirmishers, previously mentioned then withdrew to their main line. This wheel to the right was not understood by the General Reserve and it was at first43 thought to be merely a detour necessitated by the ground. No attempt was apparently made to correct the direction of advance of General Hoghton's force and by 0800 this portion of the attacking column was well on its way round the Ataba marsh and out of the fight for the time being. General Delamain then had to decide whether he would wait for Gene ral Hoghton to complete the circuit of the marsh or whether he would attack forthwith with his General Reserve. If he attacked immediately^ he would find the position less strongly occupied, and he would not fall behind the time table. At the same time, he only had 1| battalions and 1 Company of S. &amp; M. He decided to attack. The force worked round to a position between the marsh and the redoubt and attacked under cover of the fire of the 2 batteries and machine gun battery. The whole of the redoubt was not covered by the fire of the artillery, consequently the infantry suffered heavy losses from those portions of the redoubt not under our artillery fire. Eventually at 1030 the redoubt was captured: those of the enemy who escaped, withdrawing to the other redoubts nearer the Suwada marsh. In the meantime General Hoghton's force was progressing round the marsh. The troops were not making ground rapidly, as they had to plough through the mud at the edge of the marsh. When about half way round, a halt of one hour was made. As the column turned gradually west and south round the edge of the marsh, an unfinished redoubt was encountered, held by about 200 Turks. This was rapidly and easily captured and the occupants made prisoners. General Hoghton proceeded south in the general direction of a low ridge at the western end of the Suwada marsh. He detached 2 battalions of the 17th Brigade (Oxford and Bucks L. I. and 119th Infantry) to join General Delamain. These battalions joined up between US q and noon. With this reinforcement General Delamain proceeded to capture the remaining redoubts up to the Suwada marsh. This was accomplished by 1400. Previous to the assault, a number of the Turks withdrew to the low ridge, mentioned above, and from here delayed tho advance of General Hoghton. It is not clear at what time General Hoghton reached this ridge. He was there by 1600 at which hour General Delamain joined him with his force (less 119th Infantry), left to clear up and protect the ambulances. General Hoghton's advance seems to have been remarkably slow. It appears that he only covered 9 miles in 9 hours and this, when not very seriously opposed by the enemy. A small point in breaking up organization arises in connection with the 2 battalions despatched to join General Delamain. Why were 244 Battalions of tlie 17th Brigade sent ? Why were not the remaining 2 attabons of the 16th Brigade sent, thus making both Brigades complete ? { t 7 s time General Townshend at his H. Q. near Nukhailat was completely out of touch both with General Delamain and General Hogh- ton. Consequently he had no news in detail of how the operations were progressing and could not therefore order Major-General C.I. Fry C.B. of Column B, to press home his attack. The inter-communication situation was as follows 2 Brigade sections of the Divisional Signal Company were with o umn A. The length of heavy cable normally with these sections was 1- miles. The cable was made up to 20 milee. A line was laid out as the column advanced during the night. 10 miles of cable had been laid as far as to the position of deployment. In the morning, of the remaining 10 miles. General Hoghton took 7 and General Delamain 3. ,, 1 ^' uc | 1 09,1)16 was used U P V General Hoghton during his march round tHe Ataba marsh, with the result that his cable came to an end, when he ad got round the marsh and was 1 mile west of the first redoubt that irenera] Delamain had captured. General Delamam's cable was finished when he was about i mile west of the captured Turkish position. Attempts were made to continue e me with light cable, but the passage of troops and transport con tinually cut the line. mi'T a 0 ^ nmUniCatl0n ^ WaS almost i m P 0SS ible, owing to the heavy By 1315 all communication with Division H. Q. was lost. All the news that General Townshend got from his aeroplanes was that matters were going well. Two pack sets of wireless were with the force Jiotfi were set up on ships, one on the Army Corps Commander's ship • one on General Townshend's ship. One pack wireless set with General ■Uelamam would have been invaluable and permitted General Townshend to keep in touch with the situation. By the time Column A had reached the west end of the Suwada marsh, the troops were greatly exhausted. They had been on the move except for 2 or 3 long halts, since 2230 the night before. They f, 1 !? W i ate y exCe I )t w:hat Was 111 tlle i r w ater bottles and in the pakhals with the 1st line transport. They would get no water until they reached Jie ligris : for the water m the Suwada marsh was brackish and undrink- able, contrary to the report given by the Cavalry during a reconnaissance before the battle. At 1615 a mass of Turkish infantry was seen advancing from the direction of the Turkish bridge of boats. This was the Turkish reserve from the right bank advancing to the counter-attack, o i A was hastily fallen m, and commenced to advance towards the lurks. Orders were sent round by galloper and the column was on tJie move m 5 minutes.45 There was a short fire fight and then General Delamain's troops advanced with the bayonet. The Turks did not wait for this, and retired. By this time, it was getting dusk. Column A reached some sandhills north of the village of Madug, about 2 miles from the river. The troops were concentrated and a search made for the river. It could not be found. The column, therefore, bivouacked for the night where it was. All were suffering greatly from thirst. It will be noticed that the position of Column A at dusk was right in rear of the Turkish position between the Suwada marsh and the Tigris. To turn to Column B :—When the sound of the firing, due to General Delamain's first attack soon after 0800, was heard. General Fry ordered his brigade to advance. Covered by the heavy artillery, the 63rd Battery E. F. A. and the gun boats, the 18th Brigade worked its way forward to within 600 yards of the Turks. Here they remained under heavy sheli fire, waiting for the order to assault. The order never came, and the brigade remained in this position till night fell. Desultory shelling on the part of the Turks continued until mid-nigh^: when it ceased entirely. Our own gun fire was stopped when it became dark : it was feared that General Delamain's troops might be hit. The Cavalry seem not to have done very much during the battle. They only had 6 squadrons. The Turkish strength in Cavalry was also put down at 6 squadrons. The Cavalry worked on the outer flank of General Hoghton's force. No attempt seems to have been made to get , or maintain contact with the enemy. On the right bank the 30th Brigade (less 2| battalions) remained in their trenches 2 miles above the Chahela mounds all day. The Turks launched a feeble attack against them at 1500. This was easily repulsed. One more episode remains to be recorded. This was the attempt to break the obstruction in the river by the gun boats. The three ships. Comet, Sumana, Shaitan, in response to General Townshend's request to try and break the obstacle, steamed up the river about dusk under heavy shell fire. The obstacle was found to be a wire cable. Commander Cookson, the senior Naval Officer, got into a dinghy and was killed while trying to cut the cable with an axe. He was awarded the V.C. The gun boats then had to fall back down the river, but con tinued to shell the Turks from a range of about 500 yards. When it was dusk, all firing ceased, except for the desultory shelling of the 18th Brigade. No patrols seemed to have been pushed forward to keep in contact with the Turks. The result was that, during the night,the Turks slipped away, between the river and Column A, unknown both to the ISlh Brigade, only 600 yards from the Turks, and to Column A. The Turks were able to remove most of their guns and transport.46 At day-break, aeroplane reconnaissance disclosed the fact that the urks had retired during the night. An aeroplane landed near Column , gave -hem this information and also the direction of the river. Column- A and the Cavalry then proceeded to the river and quenched their tnirst, The 18th Brigade marched through the deserted Turkish position and joined Column A at Madug. The boat bridge was cut, and the flotdla steamed up to Madug, arriving at 1000. Here the 18th Brigade and 6Srd Battery E. F. A. embarked on the 4 large ships: Julnar, Mejidieh, Blosse Lynch and Mosul. Embarkation was not completed till 1400. After watering, the Cavalry and 16th Brigade marched up-stream past the Turkish bridge of boats and occupied the town of Kut without resistance. The 17th Brigade remained behind to clear up the battle-field. The pursuing flotilla started at 1400, but such were the difficulties; of navigation that it was not till 0200 30th September that it passed the Turkish bridge of boats, 4 miles up-stream. The ships did not reach Kut itself until 1600, 30th September, another 4 to 5 miles by river. The Cavalry failed to pursue, want of transport for rations and cooking pots being alleged as the reason. Thus on the evening of the 30th September, 2 days after the battle, our force had only advanced 5 to 6 miles (by land) from the battle-field. In the meantime the Turks had got well clear, unmolested. It was intended to carry out the pursuit by ships. This had been very successful during the Qurna operations : but the river was then high • now the river was almost, at its lowest level. The experienced Captains, could not prevent the ships from running aground. The channels in the river change annually after every flood season : it was the best part of a year since these men had seen the river near Kut. The Turks lost 17 guns, including 5 or 6 old mortars and muzzle Joadmg weapons, which were installed on the river bank. 1,289 prisoners were captured, including 3 or 400 Anatolian Turks. They were estimated to have lost 1,700 in killed and wounded. Our losses were 1,229 in killed and wounded. The proportion of killed to wounded was very small. The battle of Es Sinn was an extremely well planned affair. Surprise- was the main element in the plan. The measures taken by General 1 ownshend to effect this were entirely successful. But these measures involved a great strain being placed on the troops, and it is open to ques tion whether the desired effect might not have been produced by a less elaborate plan, or at any rate one involving less strain on the Infantry. Ihe Turks w-.re completely deceived by the demonstration on the right bank on thf 27th. This was proved by the following fact. A Havildar and 2 or 3 men of an Indian regiment deserted after dark on the night47 of the 27t]i-28tli. They were brought before JSTureddin, the Turkish Commander, and stated that the intention was to attack the Turkish left. Nureddin would not believe the story. The march of Column A from the bridge to Clery's post was compara tively simple. The position of the post was known accurately and bearings could be taken. For the onward march from this post to the position of deployment, it was a different matter. There were no distinguishable features, in the direction of the position of deployment, on which to take bearings. The Sapper Officer who was to guide the column spent the day of the 27th in Clery's post. He arranged that an aeroplane, the pilot of which he previously interviewed, should fly over the Turkish line on the 27th. When the machine was vertically over the left of the Turkish line, the pilot dipped. Lieutenant Matthews took a bearing on the machine, as it dipped. He was enabled to take his distances from the sketch map and so was able to work out the bearing on which he had to march. When one considers that the sketch map was made from aeroplane reconnaissance without the aid of proper photos it is remarkable that the column was guided to so nearly the correct spot. The position of deployment was intended to be due east of the left of the Turkish line : as a matter of fact the column was guided to a point, which was somewhat to the north of this spot. The next point is to try and discover w T hy the main portion of Column A went round the Ataba marsh. General Townshend on p. 113 of his book states that he intended to attack on both sides of this marsh. This is not a fact. Column A's orders were to attack the extreme left of the Turkish position. The Ataba marsh does not extend east of the Turkish position as shown in Major Sandes' book. The whole marsh is west of a line pro longing the Turkish position northwards. The information was that the Turkish line extended right up to the marsh. This did not prove to be the case. What probably happened was this :— General Hoghton knew that there were several redoubts between the Suw^ada and Ataba marshes. In the early dawn he found he was ad vancing towards a redoubt, between which and the Ataba marsh there was a gap. He concluded that this redoubt was not on the extreme flank of the position and that the flank was further to the north. He accordingly moved off to the right or north and too late found he was going round the marsh. The sketch used was not by any means an accurate one. It was made by eye from an aeroplane. Moreover it had been made some days before the battle : no machines were allowed to fly over the left of the Turkish position for about 4 days previous to the battle (except the one mentioned in connection with the taking of48 bearings for the night march), for fear of giving away the direction of the intended attack. The complete breakdown of signal communication was a very serious landicap during the battle. As we have seen, from 1300 onwards General Townshend was completely out of touch with his main force. He did not know the state of affairs until the evening, when Major Reilly, the R. F. C. flight commander, returned from General Delamain's H. Q. This officer had been able to land near General Delamain about 1600 and was able to inform General Townshend of the situation. The amount of cable, which accompanied Column A, would, had everything gone according to plan, have been sufficient to enable tele phonic communication to be maintained throughout the day. But, in war, one should always be prepared for the unexpected. It certainly seems strange that one of the pack wireless sets should not have been allocated to Column A. Column A consisted of frds of the infantry of the division, 3 out of 4 mobile batteries with the force, and the Cavalry. Its organization was as follows :— Brigadier-General Hoghton commanded the assaulting column and lad his own Brigade, the 17th, directly under his command. Colonel Mac-George, 117th Mahrattas, commanded the 2 battalions of the 16th Brigade under General Hoghton. General Delamain had directly under his command the remaining 2 battalions of his Brigade, the 16th. No member of the divisional staff accompanied Column A. The position of General Townshend and his headquarters seems to have been faulty. Situated where he was, on the river bank, he could exercise no real personal control over the main operation. This he entrusted to a subordinate, who was allotted no extra staff, although in executive ■command of the greater portion of the Force. It would appear better for General Townshend to have had his headquarters with and to have been actually in control of his main operations. Had this been the case, it is unlikely that General Hoghton's force would have been permitted to go round the Ataba marsh. The staff work prior to the operations was good. When Column A bivouacked for the night, the staff work was not good and there was great confusion and chaos. Extra staff officers might perhaps have helped to reduce this chaos. When Column A arrived at the point, some 2 miles from the river, wheie they actually bivouacked, it was 1745 and'was so dark that men could only see 300 or 400 yards. The column settled down in line, sentry groups being pushed out a little ahead. There were no proper outposts. There was no depth. There was little or no organization. The only orders that battalions received were to bivouac on a certain portion of the general line.49 The artillery bivouacked close behind the infantry. The Cavalry rode in after dark and bivouacked on the right of the line. Had the Turks made a serious counter-attack during the night, Column A was hardly in a position to have made a proper resistance. The aeroplane situation was not satisfactory at this time in Mesopota mia. There were, however, some aeroplanes in the country : the Turks lad none. A one-eyed man has a great advantage over a blind one. On the 18th September, there was only one machine, a Martinsyde, fit to fly ;at the front. Just before the battle 4 more machines arrived.—2 sea planes manned by the Naval Service, one Martinsyde and one Maurice Farman. On the 26th, one of the Martinsydes made a bad landing and was out of action on the day of the battle. As already noted the cavalry consisted of 2 regiments, neither of which was the divisional cavalry regiment. They operated together as a small brigade, but had no proper staff or inter-communication arrangements •other than regimental. The orders given to the cavalry on the 28th were to operate on the outer flank of Column A, and to make for the Turkish bridge of boats. During the night of the 27th-28th the cavalry bivouacked near Clery's post. During the 28th the cavalry had no serious fighting at all. They went in the direction of the bridge but did not reach that locality. Towards evening they returned towards Column A's bivouac in dense formation and were shelled by our own gunners, who mistook them for Turkish cavalry. In short, they accomplished nothing. On the 29th they only rode in to Kut and followed no further. Lack of transport to carry rations and •cooking pots is given as the reason of the inaction of the cavalry. It seems to be the fact that the cavalry were really not intended to use their mobility for pursuit. Had General Townshend intended so to use them, they would presumably have had the first call on the transport ■available. He preferred, however, to follow up in ships. This had been very successful after the Qurna operations. But the river then was Jbigh. Any of the river steamer Captains could have told him of the difficulties of the river, when the water was low. Then it must be remembered that the cavalry in addition to being a composite formation with no staff, had no guns. They only had 4 machine guns between the 2 regiments. Hence much could not have been expected of them in the actual fighting. If the cavalry had been intend ed to pursue, they might have had one of the batteries attached to them. General Townshend was fond of issuing long instructions with refer ences to F. 8. R., etc., in place of the normal operation orders. In this case, the operation does not seem to have been so complicated as to involve the issue of separate instructions or memoranda, such as were used for bi^ ' c set-piece' attacks in France. The fact was that he wrote all these sorts of instructions himself. That is not really the duty of the60 Gr. 0. 0. It is the work of the staff to translate the G. 0. C.'s ideas and intentions into orders to the troops. The position of 6. H. Q. calls for comment. The Corps Commander occupied the same observation tower as General Townshend all day. This, normally, would be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. In this^ particular case. General Townshend's personality was such that the presence of the Corps Commander made no difference. The same situation occurred during the approach to and battle of Ctesiphon. General Nixon, accompanied by General Townshend, marched with General Hoghton's Brigade. The conduct of this night- march was entirely the responsibility of the latter. General Nixon fre quently expressed the opinion to the Brigadier that the wrong direction was being taken. We have the word of an eyewitness that General Hoghton became much upset by this interference. It is impossible to foretell what would have been the result upon the campaign in Mesopotamia, had General Townshend's combinations worked out according to plan in the battle of Es-Sinn. Had General Townshend himself been present with Column A, and had General Hoghton not gone round the Ataba marsh, it seems very probable that the main portion, if not the entire Turkish force in Meso potamia, would have been captured or destroyed. Baghdad might have been entered without further resistance, if this had been desired. This course was certainly in General Nixon's mind at the time. Whether it would have been sound or not is another question. To sum up :— The G. 0. C. entrusts the bulk of his force, and that detailed to- strike the decisive blow, to a subordinate, with no adequate staff to^ assist him. The subordinate in turn entrusts the bulk of his force, and that intend^ ed to make the decisive attack, to another subordinate, who goes the- wrong way. The mobile part of the force, the Cavalry, effect nothing.CHAPTER V. The first British advance on Baghdad, 1915. 11.—Ctesiphon and retirement. We left General Townshend's force on the 30th September, 2 days after the battle of Es Sinn, at Kut, with the 18th Brigade and 63rd Battery R. F. A. on ships, attempting to pursue the enemy by water. Above Kut, the navigation difficulties were no less than below the town: consequently it was not till shortly after noon on October 5th that the flotilla reached Aziziya. This place was only 60 miles by land from Kut. The Turks, then, had had plenty of time in which to withdraw. They had easily out-distanced our pursuit, and had occupied the partially prepared position of Ctesiphon, with covering forces at El Kutuniya, and Zor. As we have seen, included in Sir John Nixon's orders, when he took over command of I. E. F. Ci D' in April 1915, were instructions to prepare a, plan for a subsequent advance on Baghdad. On the 30th August, one month before the battle of Es Sinn, Sir John Nixon submitted an appreciation to India on this subject. His idea was to follow on the heels of the retreating Turks after the coming battle of Es Sinn. By means of a vigorous pursuit, he hoped to enter Baghdad without another general action. Es Sinn to Baghdad was a little over 100 miles. It was a fact that after the previous battles the Turks had always retired great distances. After Shaiba, they withdrew 90 miles : after the Qurna operations, also 90 miles. Sir John Nixon may have hoped that, in the event of their suffering a heavy defeat, they would retire a similar distance. He was hopeful up to the 4th October of being able to accomplish the occupation of Baghdad. On the 3rd, he wired that he considered he was strong enough to open the road to Baghdad, and proposed concentrating at Aziziya: and on the 4th, he enquired whether he would be reinforced by another division from France, so that he could maintain himself at Baghdad. These two telegrams were despatched on the assumption that the retreat ing Turks were demoralized. On the 5th October, it was realized that the Turks were no longer retreating, but had occupied the Ctesiphon position. Sir John, however, still considered that it was advisable to 44 smash him and that nothing could justify letting slip such an opportunity.' The Home authorities had by now realized the difficulties of the pursuit by water and on 4th October the Secretary of State wired that ( 61 )62 ^ if, on account of navigation difficulties, there is no probability of the enemy being caught up and smashed, there is no object in the pursuit being continued.' This telegram was repeated to General Nixon. Finally, on October 6th, Sir John was ordered to stop his advance. Meanwhile, a reply had been sent from Mesopotamia on the subject of the ' navigation difficulties.' It was to the effect that by marching troops with land transport and by lightening the vessels, the difficulties, of navigation had been overcome. This telegram, it appears, was the cause of a great deal of misunder standing at Home. The Home authorities were, apparently, unaware of all General Nixon's requests for more river transport, and considered that this reply made it clear that sufficient transport was available in Mesopotamia. Consequently, in the subsequent discussions at Home on the subject of the advance to Baghdad, the question of river transport was not considered at all. The situation in the Near East, the likelihood of Germany getting direct communication to Constantinople, the precarious situation in Gallipoli, now drew the attention of the Cabinet to Baghdad. The capture of this city seemed very desirable on political grounds, as a set-off to our failure in the Near East. A telegram, on the 8th October, was accordingly sent to the Viceroy, stating that every effort would be made to supply the forces necessary for the occupation of Baghdad, but that it was not desired to make the attempt with insufficient forces. It may not be generally known that about this time the question of asking for the assistance of Japanese troops in Mesopotamia was considered by the Secretary of State and the Viceroy. It was suggested that 2 divisions should be asked for. As a result of the Cabinet falling a victim to the lure of Baghdad,, the question of the advisability or otherwise of the occupation of the city was considered by the General Staff at Home and by the Military advisers to the India Office. The question seems to have been considered entirely from the point of view of sufficient fighting troops : the question of transport and main tenance was not considered, presumably in view of the misunderstanding in connection with the 'navigation difficulties' telegram. Expert military opinion at Home concluded that General Nixon's force was sufficient to take Baghdad in the first instance : but that the retention of the city with existing forces was an unjustifiable risk. To hold Baghdad it was considered that 2 extra divisions must be sent. An inter-departmental Committee was appointed by the Cabinet to answer certain definite questions. This committee, composed of re- presentatives of the Foreign Office, War Office, Admiralty and India Office, came to the conclusion that, on both military and political grounds^.63 the occupation of Baghdad was most desirable, if the necessary reinforce ments could be assured. Failing these, General Nixon was not to attempt, it. No word about transport here. The matter was considered an entirely subsidiary one, for the reasons already mentioned. At the same time, the India Office, but not the War Office, were aware of the inadequate state of the river transport. As late as the 9th October, General Nixon wired to India (who repeated to the India Office) to say that ships drawing more than 3' 9' were then useless above Kut and could only navigate the lower reaches with difficulty. This applied to all the ' P ' ships, of which there were 7 (several of which are now lying derelict in the Shatt-al-Arab), He concluded by saying that the operations were seriously impeded by the lack of light draught steamers ; and that the provision of more of the latter was a very urgent necessity. ' The final result of the discussions was that General Nixon was author ized, on the 24th October, to advance on Baghdad. The War Office also agreed to spare the 2 Indian Divisions from France. The date of the despatch of these divisions could not be given, owing to the uncertain position in the Near East. We may, at this point, examine what the shipping situation actually was in November 1915. Briefly, it was the same as in May 1915, and there was no immediate prospect of the situation being ameliorated.' The actual vessels in use in the country are given in Appendix V. All these could not be used on the Tigris. Some had to work on the Euphrates, others on the Karun. Owing to the conditions in Mesopotamia (no roads, no railways but navigable water-ways), the rivers were bound to be the chief factor in L. of C. arrangements. There was a shortage of river transport from December 1914, when Qurna was occupied. The shortage became serious m June 1915, when the advance to Amara was undertaken. By November 1915, the daily available tonnage for transport up the river was 150 tons : the daily requirements were 208 tons. Certain steps had been taken to improve the situation. In January and February 1915, General Barrett asked for 7 steamers and 4 tugs. These arrived in May 1915, but as we have seen, even then the river transport was insufficient. It has been previously mentioned that the proposal made in November 1914 for the construction of 12 river steamers was not accepted by the staff in Mesopotamia. The next step taken was to ask for 6 steamers, 3 stern wheelers, 8 tugs and 43 barges to be constructed in England. This demand was' sent in from Mesopotamia on July 10th, 1915. Unfortunately, there was a good deal of correspondence between England, India and Mesopotamia regard ing specifications, etc., so the order was not actually placed until No vember 3rd, 1915. These boats arrived in Mesopotamia between April54 1916 and the end of that year. Some were not ready for work till January 1917. If the situation in May 1915 was unsatisfactory, it was obviously relatively much^worse in November 1915, with a greatly extended L. of C. and the low water season. With two extra divisions coming from France and our L. of C. extending up to Baghdad (presuming the advance to be successful) the situation would have been impossible. To a certain degree, this seems to have been realized ; for in November we find General Nixon wiring to India that the transportation of the new divisions up the river was bound to be slow. Taking these transportation difficulties into account it is difficult to realize what induced General Nixon to recommend the advance on Baghdad. It was a clear case of not cutting jour coat according to your cloth. The situation was well summed up by Sir W. Eobertson, then C. I. G. S. ' In general, the operations were ■allowed, in 1915, to develop without proper regard to the vital questions of supply and maintenance.' One other matter must be mentioned before leaving this question of the advance on Baghdad—that of the strength and probable reinforce ments of the Turks opposing us. It was agreed by England, India and Mesopotamia that the Turkish troops opposing us numbered about 9,000 men. The War Office calculated that perhaps 60,000 Turks could be opposing us by the end of January 1916. This was wired out to India in a ^private' telegram to the Viceroy. This information was not forwarded to General Nixon. Had it been sent on (21st October) it might have changed General Nixon's views. The date by which the new divisions could have arrived at Baghdad could have been worked out in detail. It would have been a race as to whether our 2 divisions from France •could have reached Baghdad before the Turks. A few days before the battle of Ctesiphon, 22nd November, the War Office wired that 30,000 troops under Khalil Pasha had left Bitlis for Baghdad on the 16th October : and that Yon der Goltz was on his way to Mesopotamia. General Nixon, however, refused to believe this informa tion. To a certain extent, the news was true, for the 3rd composite division (afterwards named the 51st) was actually present at the battle : and by the middle of December the 52nd division had also arrived. To sum up, the decision to advance to Baghdad seems to have been arrived at without due consideration having been paid to essential factors. The Home authorities were unaware of the river transport situation and imagined it to be satisfactory : India knew the transport situation but did not lay stress on this factor. General Nixon must have realized the practical difficulties involved in maintaining the existing division at the front and in transporting two new divisions to the front, but ap parently lost sight of the difficulties in the glamour of Baghdad. The55 previous advances—to Qurna, to Amara, to Nasiriya and finally to Kut— iiad all been undertaken with the avowed object of consolidating our position. The advance to Baghdad was not made with this object. It was an offensive move, to gain a striking success as a set-off to our failures in other parts of the world. Naturally, political considerations bulked large in the arguments for and against the project. But politi cal considerations should not be allowed entirely to over-ride military considerations. Let us now turn to the views of the Commander responsible for the executive conduct of the forthcoming operation. When General Town- shend, who was with his advanced Brigade, realized that he could not overtake the Turks, he wished to withdraw. He informed the. M. G. G. S. that if the Government wished to occupy Baghdad, then, in his opinion, two divisions were required for the operation, operating either together ^.s an Army Corps or with one division in front closely supported by another complete division. The reply received was that it was the Army Commander's intention to open the way to Baghdad and that a division was expected from France. This seems to have satisfied General Townshend to a certain extent, and he obtained certain reinforcements, viz., the remainder of the 30th Brigade, totalling 3 Battalions (of which he already had Battalions) and the rest of the Cavalry Brigade, including its R. H. A. Battery. On the whole it seems probable that General Townshend was not anxious to undertake the operation : as the Mesopotamia Commission says, he did not press his objections very hard, but it is not fair to expect him to have pressed his objections more than he actually did. General Townshend considered the morale of his troops to have been lowered. Three weeks before the battle he wrote to the Viceroy saying that his troops u had their tails slightly down.' He underestimated the morale of his Indian troops. The fact was that the morale of the Indian troops before the battle was high. Everyone was entirely confident; the idea did not enter anyone's head (that is of the regimental officers and men) that Baghdad would not be entered with comparative ease. This was probably General Townshend's opinion. He estimated his casualties only to be 6 per cent, that is equivalent to a total of some 600 casualties, considerably less than he had suffered at the battle of Es Sinn. General Nixon ordered a concentration at Aziziya. Accordingly the two rear Brigades (16th and 17th) marched up to this place arriving there on the 9th and 10th October. The battalions of the 30th Brigade remained in occupation of Kut. The next 5 weeks were spent in preparation, broken by a small opera tion intended to destroy the Turkish covering force, 9 miles from Aziziya^ on the night of the 27th-28th October.56 Drafts joined units. Drafts for Indian units were mostly of pooi quality. The best drafts, those of trained soldiers, were sent to the units serving in France; Mesopotamia had to be content with 8 months, recruits. In those days the training of recruits was not so systematic or so intensive, as it became later in the war. The result was that recruits, of 8 months' service really knew very little, when they joined their units. By the first week in November, most of the units were up to establishment. But the British units were milked to a certain extent to provide men employed on various base duties, in hospitals, as batmen, etc. The supply arrangements were as follows :— Kut was an advanced depot. There were 7 days' supplies in Aziziya. 15 days' supplies were to accompany the force on river transport: 2 days were carried in the supply column. Land transport as usual was. deficient. Sufficient was available for two infantry brigades and the Cavalry Brigade. The actual land transport with the force was :— Carts 660, Mules 1,000, Camels 620 and Donkeys 240. This is equivalent to a deficiency in carrying power of over 12,000 maunds, calculated on the W. E. of one division only. But there were additional units with the Force—6th Cavalry Brigade: 30th Infantry Brigade: portions of heavy batteries, etc. This still further increases the deficiency in carrying power. The remainder of the cavalry and the 30th Brigade marched up to Aziziya in small echelons : the last one arriving on the 13th November. On the 11th November, the 18th Brigade and 6th Cavalry Brigade were pushed forward to El Kutuniya. All was now ready for the advance, except that some of the ships had not yet arrived. The missing ships arrived on the afternoon of the 18th November and orders were immediately issued for the advance to be begun on the next day. The Turkish position at Ctesiphon was chiefly on the left bank of the river. Here there were 5 miles of entrenchments. The first 2 miles of trenches from the river were contained in a narrow loop of the river. It would have been very difficult to have attacked them. On the right bank, there was only about 1 mile of entrenchments. The ground on this bank was much intersected with water courses : moreover, an old loop of the Tigris existed here, which sometimes held water. The defences on the left bank consisted of 15 redoubts joined by a fire trench. The redoubts in the loop of the river were not so good as those nearer the left of the line. All the redoubts were protected with wire : this, again, was not so good on the right of their line. The feature, known by us as High Wall was situated roughly half way between Bustan and the arch of Ctesiphon. To those who have not seen this place, the name might imply an ordinary ruined wall, perhaps 8 or 10 feet high. Actually it is a very prominent feature and an extreme-57 ly important tactical position. High Wall is, in fact the ruins of an old city wall. As it stands at present, it forms 2 sides of a rectangle: the sides running about S. W. and S. E. from the point of junction. The former is about 800 yards long : the latter 600. The height varies from 20 to 25 feet. In a flat country, such as is Mesopotamia, this givea very good observation. From High Wall, the trenches run for 1 mile in a N. N. E. direction to the redoubt, named by us Water or Delamain redoubt. This redoubt is on a very small mound, only 3 or 4 feet above the surrounding country. Thence the fire trench continues to the V.P. redoubts, a distance of SjOOO yards. V. P. or Vital Point consists of two mounds some 20 feet high, and about 300 yards apart. This was the left of the Turkish front line. It was a strong position, constructed for all round defence. Between High Wall and the river, and between the former and Water redoubt and V. P. were other and smaller redoubts. These were also dug for all round defence. They were protected by wire and formed small bastions from the main line. Behind the front line, some 2 miles distant, was a second line. Accord ing to Turkish accounts this was not fully dug and we could find little trace of it. It seems to have run in a N. N. E. direction, covering the bend of the river at Bawi. In our accounts of the battle, we claim to* have arrived at a point from 300 to 600 yards distant from the Turkish 2nd line. Doubtless we were that distance from the Turks who were holding up our advance. It seems doubtful whether we were within 1 mile of the Turkish second line. Three miles from Y. P. was an old canal embankment running roughly north and south. Between the two positions and near the river was the famous Arch of Ctesiphon with a village near it on the river bank : and the village and tomb of Suliman Pak. This latter was the tomb of one of the companions of the Prophet and so was held in veneration by Mahomedans, many graves surrounding the place. One hundred yards to the south of the Arch was a mound, named by us Gurkha mound. This was held by us throughout the second day and night of the battle. The Diyala joins the Tigris about 6 miles in rear of the Turkish 2nd position. The ground in front of the 1st line from High Wall to V. P. was quite open. Occasionally there was a belt of desert grass reaching up to about the knees : but within 5 or 600 yards of the position, there was no grass. There was consequently an excellent field of fire. The trenches were well sited and not easily visible. It was noticeable, however, that the Turkish trenches were not so well designed, as those we encountered later in the campaign. The traverses were poor. The Turks had a boat bridge just up stream of their 2nd position. There was also another bridge near the mouth of the Diyala.68 General Townshend had 2 courses open to him. To attack either on the right or the left bank. The enemy's main entrenchments were on the left bank : also the majority of his force. General Townshend was first in favour of attacking up the right bank, thereby forcing the Turks to cross after him and fight him in a position that was not so well prepared. Such a plan would, moreover, avoid the necessity of having to cross the Diyala. Later he changed his mind and decided to attack on the left bank. This decision was reached on account of the bad reports he had received of the terrain on the right bank. The force was divided into 4 columns. A, B, C, and the flying column {details in Appendix vi). The plan was as follows :— Column C nearest the river was to make a holding attack between High Wall and Water Redoubt. After Column C's attack had started, Column B was to attack, moving from the Canal embankment direct towards Qusaiba : that is to say, it was to assault the Turkish 2nd line in rear of V.P. When Column B had started ifcs attack, and drawn the attention of the Turks towards it. Column A was to make the decisive attack on V.P. The flying column operating on the outer flank of Column B, was to outflank and get behind the Turkish 2nd line. The approach march was to be carried out by night as regards Columns A and B and the flying column. Column C was to leave Lajj, the jumping off place, the afternoon of the day before the battle, and move along the Baghdad road. The advance was to be quite open and ostentatious, with the idea of giving the enemy the idea that this column was the main force. Such was General Townshend's conception : but matters did not work out according to plan. As regards the enemy, General Townshend estimated them in his operation orders as 10 to 11,000 with 30 guns. This was the lowest estimate. The highest was 13,000 and 40 guns. He put the former in his orders on purpose ; his idea being that the morale of his troops might be affected, if the highest estimate was made public. This idea compares favourably with that underlying the estimate given of the enemy's strength as shown in the orders issued for the Dujaila operations in March 1916. The highest estimate was far short of the mark (by 7,000 and 12 guns). The Turkish dispositions, as far as we know them now, were as follows From Y.P. to a point short of the Water Redoubt: 142nd Regiment ('i5th Division) : in Reserve 3rd and 141st Regiment (45th Division) m rear of V. P. and in front of Turkish 2nd line.59 From Water Kedoubt to about High. Wall, 112tli Regiment (38th Division). Thence to the River, 113th Regiment (38th Division). In Reserve E of Suliman Pak, 114th Regiment (38th Division). On the right bank—35th division with 2 Regiments in line, and 1 in reserve. Reserve to whole force. 51st division with 14 Q. F. guns and 1 M. G. Coy. at Qusaiba. About 30 guns covered the 1st line on the left bank (excluding those with the general reserve). The Cavalry operated on the outer flank. To go back a little, the British marched from Aziziya to El Kutuniya on the 15th November. The bridge was re-erected tere. On the 17th, the 17th Brigade crossed to the right bank. On the 19th, the ships having arrived, the force moved to Zor, the 17th Brigade still on the right bank, to deal with possible opposition to the ships from Arab villages at dangerous loops of the river. On the 20th, 17th Brigade crossed back to the left bank, and the whole force (less a small detachment of 2 Battalions to accompany the ships) moved to Lajj. On the 21st, the ships arrived at Lajj. On the 21st, at 1400, Column C moved off in accordance with plans. The other 3 columns left Lajj at 1930, 21st, and marched in company till C015 22nd. Here Column A halted and dug in on the banks of the old canal embankment, having reached a point 3 miles ea&amp;t of V. P. Column B continued along the canal for another 1^ miles, arriving in their position at 0100. The flying column proceeded 1| miles beyond Column B. In the meantime Column C moved along the Baghdad road for 5 miles, and then went down to the river bank to fill up water bottles. Here it was shelled by our own ships, who had not been informed that the column was going to be diverted to the river. At 2200 the advance was continued ; a point 2 miles east of Bustan was reached at mid-night. Division H. Q. accompanied this column ; one staff officerj the G. S. O. 3, was lent to the other columns to guide them. The night march was difficult. There was no moon and clouds obscured the stars. While at Lajj, the commanders and officers res ponsible for guiding the columns, had proceeded a short distance towards Ctesiphon to take bearings. The position of the Turks could not be seen. Only the Arch of Ctesiphon stood up as a landmark. Presumably High Wall could not be seen. This seems to be strange and can only be accounted for by the fact that any reconnaissance, except from the air, must have been made from some distance off. As regards the map60 made from the air by Major Eeilly, E. F. C., which proved to be very accurate as regards main essentials, and on which the battle was fought, little is made of this very remarkable feature. High Wall, which stands up clearly either from the ground or from the air. No Commander or Staff Officer saw the position from air or ground. At 0600 Column C began their advance. General Townshend ordered their left to be directed on the Arch. This must have brought them close past High Wall. They went forward slowly and cautiously and the Turks did not open fire. At 0745 fire had not been drawn. Accordingly Column B was told to advance ; it started at 0800. Column A advanced at 0900. Column A moved very rapidly, as is shown by the fact that their objective, Y. P. was captured at 1020. Vital Point was 3 miles distant from the jumping off position. There was practically no artillery support. The 5' guns who were supposed to fire on V. P. only fired a few rounds. They fired but 11 rounds in all during the day, owing to the mirage. Artillery co-operation was not satisfactory. This was probably due to the fact that an improvised brigade (with no proper staff or inter-communication arrangements) carried out the actual attack. It proved very difficult to communicate with the guns. Casualties, consequently, were unnecessarily heavy. Some units in Column A suffered over 60 per cent, casualties, the majority of these being incurred in this attack. Column C, already directed too much to the left, inclined still further in this direction, owing to the necessity of dealing with a small redoubt at Bustan. Consequently they had to make an oblique march towards the Water Redoubt in order to get on to their proper line. In doing so, they suffered severe casualties from machine gun fire from High Wall. At 1030 Column C asked Column A for assistance. The message was received at 1145. Half a battalion of the Dorset Regiment and the remains of the half battalion 24th Punjabis were despatched towards Water Redoubt. With this assistance the remainder of the Turkish front line was captured about 1300. It should be noted that during the battle, the Turkish guns on the right bank effectually checked the attempts of the Naval flotilla to get up the straight reach of the river west of Bustan, with a view to enfilading the enemy trenches. In the meantime Column A had reorganized and advanced towards the Turkish 2nd line. By about noon they reached a point, a little over 1 mile N.-W. of V. P., when they were brought to a standstill by heavy fire. Column B at 1130 had also been brought to a stop about 1| miles N. by E. of V. P. Their right flank was exposed owing to the with drawal of the Flying Column. The Flying Column had, in the early r morning. advanced in a direction that brought them towards the Turkish 2nd liue and not on its flank. They were brought to a stop by a61 Turkish attack delivered by 5 battalions of the 51st Division from tlie Reserve, while their flank was threatened I y Turkish Cavalry and Arabs. They had to retire, and by 1115 they were echelonned some distance in rear of Column B. The situation then, about noon, was that the whole Turkish front line was in our possession. Column C were actually in the position from the Water Redoubt for a short distance riverwards. Columns A and B were held up roughly mid-way between the 1st and 2nd Turkish lines, with the Flying Column some distance to the right rear of Column B. There were no reserves : the force of the attack was spent. As there was no chance of the Flying Column now being able to .fulfil -its role, and as it was suffering severely in horses, orders were given for it to withdraw to the sandhills (the old canal), the infantry battalion joining Column B. The fight was now stationary : but clearly a counter attack was to be ►expected. This began, about 1500 to 1530 carried out by 2 battalions of the 1)1 st Division, the remains of the 45th Division, and one battalion from the 105th Regiment (35th Division). The counter-attack succeeded in pushing back the remains of Column A towards V. P., and caused them to lose 8 guns which had previously been captured. The Column maintained a position 800 to 1,000 yards in front of V. P. till dusk. Column C was ordered to advance to take the pressure off Column A •and succeeded in doing so. Column B now seemed to be somewhat isolated : but it maintained its position and even made a short advaoce towards the evening. At dusk firing died away completely on both sides. Orders were jgiven for the troops to concentrate in V. P. for the night. Consequently most of Columns A, B and C were collected in this spot. General Dela- main was sent to command and collect what troops he could in the Water Redoubt. Thus the night passed with the British in the Turks 1st line, and the Turks in their 2nd line. Next morning, 23rd, re-organization was taken in hand : units and columns had become much mixed. Column € held V. P., Column A (less 2-7th G. R. and 24th Punjabis) held Water Redoubt: while Column B went to High Wall (less 2 battalions to Water Redoubt). As the enemy could pass by the left of our position near the river, the mound, near the Arch of Ctesiphon (Gurkha Mound) was held by the 2-7th G. R. and 24:th Punjabis. The rifle strength of these two units was only 300 and 100 respectively. The machine gun battery was also located here. The day passed quietly till about 1600 when the Turks showed signs of advancing for a general counter-attack. The counter attack started about dusk and for the remainder of the night, the works62 made attempts to capture V. P., the Water Kedoubt and Gurkha Mound- They were unsuccessful and withdrew at dawn. From Turkish sources^ we know that their divisions were in great chaos this night. They wandered in circles over the country, and in many cases attacked objec tives that had not been given them. The whole of the 35th Division attacked Gurkha Mound, but could make no headway. On the 24:th, the whole force concentrated at High Wall, Column C from V. P. only arriving during the night 24th-25th. High Wall?,, being such a prominent feature, drew the fire of the Turkish artillery,, who shelled it intermittently all day. On the Turkish side, an Arab patrol reported the advance of a British column towards the Diyala on the early morning of the 24th. Actually this body was their own 51st Division withdrawing after the night counter attack. ISTuruddin issued orders for a retreat to the Diyala. This was^ actually carried out during the night of the 24th-25th. On the 25th* seeing that the British made no forward move, the Turks again advanced. This advance was reported to General Townshend by aero plane. Believing that the Turks had been reinforced and taking into consideration the heavy casualties that had been incurred he^ determined to retire at once to Lajj. The withdrawal began at 2030 25th, Lajj was reached without incident at 0230 26th. During the action General Townshend's force had incurred 4,600 casualties against the Turks 9,500. On the 27tb, the Turkish Cavalry began to regain contact. General Townshend determined to withdraw to Aziziya. On this day, the main Turkish force was still in the vicinity of Ctesiphon, its advance being delayed by supply difficulties. Their ships could not pass a mined obstruction they had laid across the river near Suliman Pak. The British left Lajj at 1600, 27th, and reached Aziziya at 0500, 28th. At noon on this day the main Turkish force reached Lajj. The British then were 23 miles ahead of the Turks. Aeroplane reports on the 29th afternoon reported the enemy with an advanced guard at El Kutuniya and their main body at Zor. Actually on the evening of the 29th, the whole Turkish force was in and around the El Kutuniya woods, 7 to 8 miles from Aziziya. On the morning of the 30th, the British started for Kut, the 30th Brigade marching 20 miles, the remainder 10 miles. The reason given for this short march of the main portion of the division was the difficulties of the ship flotilla. Navigation was difficult, and it was thought that 10 miles as the crow flies, was the limit of the day's journey for the ships. This was according to General Townshend's report. When the Senior Naval Officer beard of this, he brought the facts to the notice of General Nixon. The facts were that the Senior Naval Officer pointed63 oat to General Townshend on the afternoon of the 30th that the' sliips had been forced to waste several hours of daylight, owing to- tlie shortness of the march. He was given to understand that thi» was due to the exhaustion of the troops. But as the 30th Brigade marched 20 miles that day, there seems no reason why the remain der should not have marched more than 10 miles. The Turks on this day, the 30th, left El Kutuniya at noon. A long halt was made at Aziziya, where a fair amount of supplies, stores, etc., hacF been abandoned. Sometime before dusk, probably about 1500 to 1530 the Turks continued their march, the objective being a village some 8 miles down stream of Aziziya. Now that we are in a position to know the movements of both armies, it is clear that the two forces would come in contact on the night of the- 30th November—1st December. Neither force, however, was aware of the proximity of the other: due to lack of proper reconnaissance on both sides. The Turkish cavalry, which should have been, and was supposed to be, ahead of their main body, was looting Aziziya, 10 miles behind. At about 2000 the Turks saw lights ahead on the river bank : think ing these to be the camp fires of their cavalry, they moved towards the 4 lights. They were fired on and realized that the British force was camped on the river bank. The Turks opened fire with some guns, upon which our lights were extinguished. Imagining that the British would retire immediately, they camped in the desert where they were. The night passed quietly. When dawn broke, the enemy's camp was seen about 11 miles distant. The enemy's infantry began to advance. The British artillery opened? rapid fire at a range of 2,300 yards and caused great confusion in the^ camp. Our infantry was ordered to attack—18th Brigade straight to their front, 16th and 17th Brigades to envelop the enemy's left flank r tha Cavalry Brigade operated on the outer flank of the two latter- Brigades. The counter-attack was successful: the Turks fell back. The transport had been set in motion at dawn and was by now clear. The action was broken off between 0730 and 0800 and the retirement commenced. At 0900 the 30th Brigade arrived, having been recalled. The Turks were still following up. The 30th Brigade took up the duty of rearguard to the whole force. After one or two hours the Turks ceased to follow up except with small numbers of Arab cavalry. The Turks had over 700 casualties. Ours amounted to about 500. Unfortunately, the Turks had been able to get guns down to the river bank and our shipping was severely handled. H. M. S. Firefly and Comet were set on fire and abandoned. H. M. S. Shaitan had previously been lost, as she went hard aground and could not be refloated. In addi tion we lost 2 or 3 barges and launches.64 The British, force marched all day till 1800 to a place 20 miles from Kut. The 6th Division had marched 30 miles : the 30th Brigade -34 miles. On the 2nd December, the force marched to within 3 miles of Kut, which was entered early on the 3rd December. The Turks had been entirely out-distanced : the only trouble met with was from Arabs, who, as usual, turned against the retreating side. The plan of the battle of Ctesiphon was very similar to that of the battle of Es-Sinn, that is to say, that the force at General Townshend's disposal was split up into columns, leaving no reserve in the hands of the commander of the whole. Complete envelopment of the Turkish forces was planned, as at Es-Sinn. This sort of plan, aiming at envelopment on a wide front, and i^ith the whole force given to subordinate commanders, with no Teserve in the commander's hands, depends, one may say, for its .success on success. If anything unexpected throws the machinery out of gear, failure is likely to result: for there is no body of troops at the commander's disposal, with which he can cause the wheels to revolve ■again. Accurate information and superior numbers are essentials for .success. In this particular case, neither of these essentials was present. It was regrettable that our information regarding the enemy's numbers was inaccurate. The enemy's strength was under-estimated by 50 per cent.; moreover the presence of an Anatolian Turk division was unknown. So certain was the Intelligence Staff at G. H. Q. of the accuracy of their estimate, that when General Townshend in his report gave the Turkish figures as 20,000 (a figure which we now know to be accurate) this state ment was challenged by the G. H. Q. Staff. Information about the ground and the enemy's position, gained from personal reconnaissance on the part of commanders or staff, was entirely lacking. Proper maps •of Mesopotamia were not in existence : all detailed sketching had to be done by eye from an aeroplane. Considering all things, the sketches produced were remarkably accurate. But accurate eye sketches cannot xeplace personal reconnaissance. Had this latter been carried out from the air or ground, the great tactical importance of High Wall must have been observed. As we have alread} 7 ' noted, the splitting of the whole command into 4 •columns left nothing in hand to meet unforeseen contingencies. There was another serious objection to this plan : it resulted in the small force •of mobile land artillery being divided among the four columns. Thus iihere could not be any really adequate artillery support at any one spot. It was due to this that the infantry casualties were so heavy. An interesting point arises in connection with the Flying Column. The eventual task of this column was to press on and occupy Baghdad after the battle General Townshend did not trust the G. 0. C. Cavalry Brigade : accordingly he placed an infantry brigadier, noted for his65 energy and drive, in command of this column, and, in order to make it a mixed force, added a battalion of infantry. A certain number of carts was allotted to this infantry battalion to make it more mobile. Yet this battalion must have been a drag on the Cavalry Brigade. The arrangement was not satisfactory. It is suggested that a plan on the following lines might have proved ■sounder. Taking into account the importance of High Wall, one brigade to attack this locality, keeping its left on the river past Bustan. This brigade, to be the 30th. The whole of the 6th Division, ^nd the cavalry, under the immediate command of the G. 0. C. and staff to attack with its right on V. P. and its left on the Water Redoubt, supported by every gun possible, except the minimum required to support the 30th Brigade. It is not claimed that, in the actual circumstances the adoption of such a plan would have caused the complete defeat of the Turks. The latter'e numbers were probably too great. It has, however, the enormous ad vantage of simplicity, combined with the personal direction of the Commander. The capture of the Turkish front line would, at any rate, probably have been accomplished with less loss, and the ensuing disorganization would have been avoided. General Townshend accomplished his retreat to Kut successfully. 2-3rds of the distance was covered in 2| days : the other l-3rd (the first portion) in about 5 days. This resulted in considerable exhaustion of the troops. This state of affairs and the hurried, long and almost continuous marching (including a severe rearguard action) at the end of the retreat, can be ascribed almost entirely to touch being completely lost with the Turks. The cavalry were not continuously watching the enemy : reliance was placed on aeroplane reports. These, owing to the condition of the R. F. C. in Mesopotamia at the time, were not so frequent or so accurate as they might have been. For instance, the information brought in on the afternoon of the 29th November was faulty. The whole enemy force and not an advanced guard only was close at hand. Two complete days were wasted at Aziziya, largely owing to ignorance of the Turkish dispositions. General Townshend showed himself at his best during the rearguard action on the 1st December. The situation was awkward. The British force was caught, with its impedimenta on the banks of the river by the whole of the Turkish force. The energy and decision of the Commander fully deserved the result—a rude check and severe handling dealt out to the pursuers. The action is a fine example of a successful counterstroke during a retreat under more than ordinary difficulties.CHAPTER VI. Campaigning Conditions 1916. In order to get any true perspective or a proper appreciation of the fighting, it is essential that the conditions obtaining in Mesopotamia in 1916 should be appreciated. To bring these home adequately to any one who has not seen the country is extremely difficult, but it is proposed in this chapter to attempt to convey some impression of tha atmosphere that then existed. The whole theatre of operations is as flat as a billiard table. There mi ^ are no trees, and practically no land marks. It is&gt; The Country. . -i i / i , . . , impossible to locate one s position except by com pass bearing and pacing. This induces in the individual a sense of isolation, and an impotent feeling of being lost. Such land marks as. there are, in the shape of occasional banks of ancient canals, are obs cured by mirage during most of the day. The mirage also distorts and. confuses all objects a mile or more away, and gives them a false im pression of movement, so that small bushes are reported as cavalry, birds as infantry scouts, and so on. Man in these surroundings feels^ like an ant on a skating rink. The only permanent feature is the river Tigris, and it is usually impossible to see this at all until one is within a few yards of the edge of the bank. The Tigris is usually from 300 to 600 yards wide normally about 20 feet deep, and subject to rise&amp; of 20 feet or more, when it floods over the country. Owing to the peculiar conditions under which alluvial ground is formed the river actually flows on the highest part of the country, although the slopes- are quite imperceptible. The result is that not only do these slopes add to the difficulty of observation across the river from the far bank, but directly the flood is sufficient to top the banks, the water spills over and forms great inundations on both sides. To prevent this the Arabs- often make a bund (bank) continuously along the edge of the river ta help to confine it. These bunds naturally require a great deal of care to keep them in order and even then are constantly subject to breach. The flood season is normally from March to May, but floods are not uncommon as early as January. Under the effect of rain or flood the country is turned into a bog of particularly tenacious mud. In dry weather it breaks up into dust very easily, and dust-storms are of frequent occurrence. At many points the Arabs have constructed water cuts through the bund to irrigate their fields. Burh cuts run away from the river to distances varying from a few hundred yards to several miles, and accordingly vary greatly in dimensions. In all cases, the excavated earth has been piled up in banks on both sides of the cut. Also such a cut affords good covered ( 66 )67 ■communication and a ready-made trench and is surprisingly incons picuous at a short distance. For the most part the surface is bare ' putt,' hut in the spring there is a considerable growth of grass up to perhaps 18 inches in height. Here and there, especially in the vicinity of the river, there are bushes and low scrub 3 to 4 feet high. A very important point is that apart from the river there is practically no drinking water to be found anywhere. In the winter the nights are cold, often below freezing point. Climate There is a good deal of rain during the first four months of the year, when heavy thunderstorms •are common. In the Summer the temperature rises to 130 degrees in the shade. There is no cover. Sandflies abound. Flies exist in incon ceivable myriads, especially when, as was the case during the fighting in 1916, such a plethora of excellent breeding places was provided ior them. The outstanding feature that was painfully impressed at once on Transport. ever y newcomer, was the shortage of transport. Details of this are given in other chapters. The effect of it on the fighting man was that on landing at the front in January 1916 he found his unit almost devoid of means of conveyance. .No cook carts or water carts, no chargers ; in many cases no pack animals even for machine guns or ammunition. In some of the early battles of this year, troops went into action with regimental reserves of 'S- A. A. man-handled by carrying parties. The limitations thus im posed on mobility were crippling; moreover the inevitable result was that the men were constantly on short rations. There was no fresh food, there were no vegetables, and the authorised allowance of even standard ration articles had frequently to be severely cur tailed. Moreover there was no fuel available, a particularly serious .matter in the case of Indian troops. Shift had to be made by rli gg in g up the roots of such scanty bushes as could be found. The discomfort involved and the inability to provide fires, especially in weather that was cold and wet, undoubtedly had considerable effect on the health of the troops. There were, of course, no comforts or canteens ; nor would there have been any means of transporting such had they been in exis tence. There was very little tentage. Even sick and wounded had ■often to he m the open, or dangerously crowded together. There was -a certain number of single fly 21-lb. tents into which men were crowded, this in a country where the sun is considered by medical officers so strong as to make it advisable to wear a topee even in a double-fly tent. The troops that took part in this campaign arrived piecemeal from Organization. France, Egypt and India. Often regimental trans port would be considerably behind its own unit.68 Headquarters were separated from their commands, and units split up. The result was that formations were hurriedly created, drafts being thrown together into units, composite battalions formed of detach ments regardless of incompatilibity of temperament, and staff and commands hastily improvised. With regard to Command, the lesson which had been so forcibly impressed upon the Indian Corps in France had not been learnt in Mesopotamia, i.e., the vital necessity of commands being in the hands of comparatively young and physically fit men. This was even more im portant under the conditions existing in Mesopotamia than in France, where some relief and comfort could be obtained after periods of strain, and where orders could generally be issued under comparatively favour able conditions. Many drafts arrived in the rain and hail of January clad in thin khaki drill. There was a shortage of topees and Clothing. blankets and indeed, at the front, of all clothing. There was a great shortage of shell particularly of H.E. for the guns. The troops from France, who formed Munitions. ^ ina j or i t y 0 f the relief force, were armed with rifles sighted to take Mark VII ammunition. Only Mark YI was available in Mesopotamia. No bombs, grenades. Very lights or periscopes were available. With all these the Turk was provided. Means of communication were hopelessly inadequate. Not only was there a shortage of Signal personnel and Communications. formations but also of cable. Wireless was only available for Corps Headquarters. Brigades and Battalions were practically reduced to visual, which is extremely difficult in a flat country especially in proximity to the enemy, or to runners, a waste ful method and very slow in mud. At the beginning of the year there were no maps worthy of the name, nor even reconnaissance sketches of the area in which the operations took place. Attempts were made to produce a rough half-inch map pieced together from sketches made from the air or on the ground by staff officers. But such reconnaissances were made under great difficulties, on the ground because the activity of the Arabs necessitated very large mounted escorts for reconnoitring officers, and even topographical infor mation could seldom be obtained without fighting for it : from the air because of the shortage of machines and the almost total absence of trained observers. Air photography was unknown. It was not until the middle of the summer that accurate maps began to be produced. The shortcomings of the Medical Services are dealt with in the Eeport of the Mesopotamia Commission. From Medical. ^ point of view of the man at the front the state of affairs was appalling. After the heavy fighting in January69 the only means of removing the wounded from the battle-fields was by- means of springless A.T. carts. The suffering thus caused to frac ture cases requires no comment. Owing to the mud the mule-carts very often stuck, and were in any case quite inadequate. There is no doubt that many wounded not only died from exposure but were* actually drowned in the mud. Even when a wounded man arrived at the river bank his condition was little better. He was laid in a crowded line on the bare iron deck of an iron barge with the rain and hail driving down on him, lucky if he got a share of a blanket. The- medical personnel was utterly insufficient to deal with the enormous number of cases, and had this not been so, material supplies were quite inadequate. Wounded often went many days without it being possible- to change their first field dressings or splints hastily improvised on the- battle-field from rifles or fragments of wood. Add to this that many of them owing to climatic conditions were suffering from diarrhoea or dysentery, and that sweepers were almost non-existent. The state- of affairs utterly baffles description. Such conditions are bound to react unfavourably on morale. Troops coming from France found themselves dumped down on the river bank in a sea ot mud, with little tentage and less transport, with poor rations, no fuel, and medical arrangements of the most pri mitive description. Then there were the tactical difficulties. The difficulty of maintain ing direction, the impossibility of self-location, the dependence on com- ' Tactical Diffi- passes of which very few were available. The culties. 5 ' apparent impossibility of observation, the dis heartening effect of moving forward to attack an unseen enemy under a hail of small arms fire whose source was invisible, and the baffled feeling of blindness induced by the above factors, all caused a depressing sense of impotence. The difficulty of distinguishing friend from foe, of locating one's own flanks, or judging the distance gained all added to this feeling. This country is par excellence a country of the defensive. Not only do the water cuts form invisible ready-made trenches, but digging in this soil is extremely easy, and earth w^orks which can hardly be dis tinguished even at a hundred yards distance can be constructed very rapidly. There is no obstacle to small arm fire which is £&lt; grazing. 5 r On the other hand everything is against the attacker. He is extremely conspicuous against the sky to a man in a trench with his head on ground level. Overhead supporting fire is particulariy difficult even apart from the impossibility of accurate observation. Something must be said about the Arabs. Their attitude was probab- Arab. ^ not llostile to us in particular. They objected to anyone coming into their country or attempt-70 tng to control them. They are true sons of Ishmael, and pillage the los ing side impartially. They were out for loot, not for glory. The Turk, however, had the advantage over us of having been the man in posses ion and therefore having more chance of influencing them. A large pro portion of them were mounted, and though their ponies are small they ;are very active and could make rings round our heavily burdened cava lry. They never risked a fight with any considerable body, but would hang round in crowds at long ranges discharging their rifles from the saddle at our close formations and looking out for any opportunity of cutting off small parties. They are expert thieves, and can get through .any form of obstacle unobserved at night. Their exploits in this direc tion outdo even the bestknown instances of Pathan achievements on the frontier of India. Being out for plunder they naturally had no hesita- ition in dispoiling our dead, and used to dig up corpses for the sake of their clothing and boots. This necessitated careful concealment of the places of burial. They had a disproportionate influence on the campaign, at any rate during the early months of the year. Had it been possible to take vigorous offensive action against them, it is probable that the nuisance would have been greatly abated; but lack of good cavalry lead ership, the political situation, and the hopeless shortage of transport precluded this. In January and February the troops on the right bank at Ora were even confined within a perimeter camp though within range of Turk artillery. Throughout the operations the fear of Arab action had a considerable effect on the dispositions of troops and re duced the sum of effectives owing to the number of guards that had to be found, and to the precautions considered necessary for protecting the flanks of any operation. To sum up: The material difficulties under which this campaign was undertaken could hardly have been worse. There was a shortage of almost every thing necessary for its prosecution. Under the circumstances, so far from its being surprising that the relief of Kut was never achieved, the more the facts are studied the more astonishing do the achievements of the troops appear. This may be put down mainly to two factors. Firstly, the great energy and determination of the commanders of the Tigris Corps, Generals Aylmer and Gorringe, their superhuman efforts to overcome insuperable obstacles with inadequate means, their great personal activity, and their unwavering resolution to rescue the garri son in Kut, are writ large in these four black months. The second factor was the excellent quality and extraordinarily high morale of the troops, particularly those who came from Egypt, and most of all the Indian Corps from France. These two latter Divisions were of course seasoned troops, who had been through much hard fighting in the mud of Flanders. In spite of the fact that casualties had been very heavy71 formations had developed traditions of their own and a camaraderie between British and Indian ranks which, in the case of some Brigades, has probably never been equalled. Their performances speak for them selves. Never before have Indian formations been asked to fight under such heartbreaking conditions and in the teeth of such monstrous casualties. As was well said in an official telegram, they did all that flesh and blood could do.( 72 ) CHAPTER VII. Administration 1914—16—General. This Chapter deals, from the point of view of the higher command,, with certain parts of the administrative services from the beginning of the Mesopotamian campaign till the end of the relief operations for Kut. The services considered will be :•— (1) Transport, river and rail. (2) Supply. (3) Medical. Two main principles of war organization are firstly mobility and secondly economy of military force by utilising to the greatest possible extent the ordinary machinery of civil life to assist the forces in the field. We shall see how these principles were adhered to in the organization and development of I.E.F. u D In November 1914, when General Barrett River transport. captured Basra with the 6th Division, his river transport consisted of :— 3 river steamers; 17 lighters, whose total carrying capacity was 2,540 tons ; A number of mahailas (native boats) usually towed, but capable of sailing under favourable circumstances, and each capable of carry ing 25 to 39 tons, when the river was at its lowest. At this time policy dictated that our forces were not to advance from Basra and that our object was merely to safeguard the oil-fields at Ahwaz and the refineries at Abadan. It was recognised that opera tions, however, would probably have to extend as far as Amara and Nasariya. A conference was therefore held at Force Headquarters in November 1914 at which the river transport authorities urged that 12 river steamers should be brought from India. But the limited scope of the expedition evidently acted as a deterrent and nothing was done. In January 1915, the Indian Government contemplated operations above Qurna and General Barrett stated that he would require, in addition to existing vessels :— 7 steamers and 2 lighters to carry 1 bde. infantry, 1 sqn. cavalry, 1 bty. K. F. A., 1 F. Coy., 500 mules and 10 days' supplies. This reply indicated the outlook of the miJitary authorities at that time. Policy up till then had not required more.73 Meanwliile the Turks had advanced to Shaiba. They remained opposite us at Qurna and had pushed towards Ahwaz. A British bri gade of reinforcements arrived from Egypt and the nucleus of th^ 12tli Division arrived from India. The river fleet was increased in May by arrivals from India of 7 steamers, 4 tugs and 2 lighters. The total fleet thus consisted of— 10 steamers, 4 tugs and 19 lighters. The method of using the lighters was to lash one on either side of a steamer. The method worked well in high water but the shifting shoals in time of low water made navigation very slow and difficult. No further increase in the fleet took place till January 1916. Tbe new steamers were ' P ' boats from Burma. They draw 5' of water and were sternwheelers or screw driven and with difficulty plied above Qurna, where only boats of 3' 6' draught were reliable. The 70-mile stretch of the river above Qurna is known as the ' Narrows' ard is difficult at the best of times. Thus, as early as June 1915, the mobility of the force had actually decreased. Before the advance to Amara the steamers used by General Gorringe on the Karun had to be returned. Nasariya could not be fought till one month after Amara, and the first battle of Es Sinn was not fought till September 1915 owing to the same cause. We had sufficient troops but not sufficient steamers to undertake simultaneous operations. In July 1915 a D' Headquarters had taken steps to meet the deficiency and had asked for— 6 paddle steamers, 2 sternwheelers, 8 tugs and 42 barges or lighten?. It was not till November 1915 that the Government finally ordered these vessels. The paddle steamers began to arrive in June 1916, one year after they had been demanded. All the others arrived in sections and some were not ready till January 1917. The experiment was first tried of towing these ships over from India. In this process 3 paddle steamers, 22 lighters, 17 sternwheelers, 2 flats and 1 floating dock foundered at sea. I.E.F. ' D ' Headquarters in asking for the new vessels added the warning. ' It is thought necessary to add the warning that if steps are not taken in good time to meet these requirements we are running grave risks of a breakdown at possibly a serious moment. In any crisis insufficiency of river transport would limit the scope of reinforcements while a breakdown of sLipping might have still more serious conse quences.^ p 274 This warning was given by the highest authority on the spot at a time when the total force to be supplied was less than half what it amounted to 8 months later. The breakdown began in November 1915 when the daily tonnage available was 150 tons and the daily require ments 208 tons. The worst crisis occurred in April 1916 when the daily tonnage available was less than half that required. On January 21st, when the battle of Hanna was fought, there were 10,000 infantry and 12 guns immobilised in Basra. On March 8th, the date of the battle of Dujaila 12,000 men and 26 guns were absent from the decisive point for the same reason. It must be remembered that the round trip from Basra to Fallahiya and back took 20 days. Thus from the first advance from Qurna to the attempt on Baghdad, and again in the attempt to relieve Kut, the inadequacy of river trans port weakened or paralysed the striking powers of the force. But even if shipping itself had been plentiful, the port of Basra would have been incapable of dealing with it. In November 1915, there were nothing but provisional piers of wood. The unloading faci lities were little less primitive than at the time of the capture of the place. Ships had to anchor in mid-stream and unload into native craft. The only real improvement appeared to be that the floods were kept in bounds and did not encroach on the land as happened in June 1915. Even as late as July 1916 it was usual for a ship to spend 39 days in port before being free to return on its homeward voyage, and this at a time when shipping was becoming an increasing asset in winning the war. Sir George Buchanan who was sent out from India to in vestigate, reported— The military expedition to Basra is, I believe, unique inasmuch as in no previous case has such an enormous force been landed and main tained without an Adequately prepared base.' Between December 1st, 1915 and March 31st, 1916, the following disembarked at Basra :— Personnel 129,500, Animals 33,000, Vehicles 4,800 and Cargo 71,500 tons. By the end of 1916 the port had been improved. The turn round ' of a ship had been reduced to 20 days. It was calculated that a further reduction of 10 days would save the Government £600,000 per annum. Even then the river was no' better than a single railway and it had to supply an army of 120,000 men more than two hundred miles distant from its base at Basra. The R. I. M. had no training nor was it sufficiently numerous to administer large inland waterways. Yet in her large inland water services India had skilled personnel at her disposal. It was not till the I. W. T. took over that efficiency was obtained.75 U The question of railway construction was first brought up by tit General Barrett in February 1915 when the scope of the operations was ^ being extended to Nasariya and Amara. He Railwav ire- * suggested that work should be commenced that lily year when the floods subsided. Beyond asking him whether a light 1st, railway, for which there was plant for 137 miles available in India, Ad would meet the case, the Government did nothing and seemed to tie attach little importance to the question. In August 1915, General Nixon returned to the charge and said he om required a railway, but not the light railway which had been offered before. It had been discovered that this had been used at the Coro- ai nation Durbar and was unsatisfactory. After much delay and repeated ns. reminders, he was informed in November 1915 that for the present the Government had decided not to proceed with the construction of the sra railway on the ground of expense. Thus the Government of India's decision on Sir John Nixon's application for a railway was not given till nearly three months after it had been received, though he had asked ^ for an early decision on the matter. flj Let us see how this application from the man on the spot fared at ^ Sinjla. In a few well rounded phrases the Finance Member treated it ^ as follows :— in 'I confess to being somewhat sceptical as to the line being so re- at munerative as is at present represented. Apart from this, it is perfectly m clear that in present circumstances we cannot embark on large expendi- jfl. ture on such a project for other than the most urgent military reasons. We have already had to cut our own railway programme in India to the ^ quick. Further, we have at present no right to act as if we were certain of getting Mesopotamia after the war. If, however. His Excel lency the Commander-in-Chief can definitely assure me that this project is absolutely necessary for the safeguarding of our military in S position, I cannot of course resist a reference home. In that event it- will be necessary, as Mr. Fell says, to indicate to the Secretary of State 500 that the cost must fall on the Home Government.' That minute was written on October 5th when the advance to Baghdad was being contemplated. Success was looked upon ay certain. ^ Consolidated at Baghdad, with no further geographical objective to aim ^ at, it was hoped that no railway would be necessary. The difficulties of the Hammar Lake crossing were known in India, the extreme heat k s prevailing in the summer was known in India, the discomfort and suffer- ^ ing not only to the wounded but to fit men was known in India. But fet the Commander-in-Chief would not endorse the opinion of his subordi- ttel nate on the spot. He failed to press the case as one of urgent military icf necessity and the proposal was rejected on the grounds of expense.76 After the fall of Kut and when the War Office took over the control of operations, the construction of the railway was put in hand. Late in 1916 the first two lines were ready. A metre-gauge line 140 miles in length ran from Basra to Nasariya and obviated the crossing of the Hammar Lake. The Qurna-Amara Section relieved to some extent the over-burdened river transport over the ' Narrows.' In 1917, after the fall of Baghdad, and the advance to Samarra, our lines of communications were more than doubled. Troops were posted in places inaccessible by water, and an exceptionally low water level was anticipated in the shallow stretches between Kut and Baghdad. The work of construction of a metre-gauge track between these two towns was pushed forward with the utmost speed, all the rails and roll ing stock being obtained from existing stocks in India, and the first train ran through in August 1917. The river journey from Kut to Baghdad, 216 miles, took two days. Baghdad could be reached by train, a distance of 108 miles, in twelve hours. There is no doubt that this prevented the development of a situation which might have become serious, and it may be looked upon as one of the best technical pieces of work carried out in Mesopotamia. Very early in the campaign the shortage of shipping reacted on the ouestion of supply. One great difficulty was the transport of vegetables Supplies ^ ar S es w hich were unsuitable. The barges attached to the river steamers were filled with potatoes for instance. Troops had to be carried on these in addition and large consignments arrived unfit for consumption. The supply services were not at first alive to the local resources of the country and all supplies came from India. Large quantities of rice were obtainable locally but it was not till the end of 1915 that Indian troops were asked whether they would consent to eat local rice. As the latter was of a much inferior quality, they naturally chose the Indian rice. All fuel had to be brought from India as the palm tree proved too wet for combustion. The Indian ration itself proved unsuitable. It had been fixed in 1912 on a scale sufficient for short frontier campaigns and had only been slightly modified. In 1915 it was reported that the ration had certain intrinsic defects and an enquiry was recommended into its caloric value, vitamine content, and anti-scorbutic properties. The British ration was increased and varied more easily, though articles like butter and cheese arrived at the front in a highly active state in the hot weather. The original organization of Force ' D ' was on a lower medical Medical basis than for a frontier campaign. The medical organization in India did not admit of very rapid77 expansion and Headquarters retained in India a surplus over require- ments for frontier campaigns. War Establishments provided for eight ambulance tongas for each ambulance, but Force 44 D ' was allotted extra riding mules instead, ^s it was thought that operations would only take place on the river banks, and that in any case the country was unsuitable for wheels. A.T. oarts however were not omitted in spite of this premise. The first two motor ambulances were used with very good results at Ctesiphon, where they worked between the battle-field and the steamers at Lajj, ten miles down river. On the sea, the first hospital ship came to Basra in November 1915 and evacuated the wounded from the battle of Es Sinn in September. There was no special accommodation for sick or wounded on the rivers. The chief medical officer of the force considered that specially fitted mahailas would be sufficient. The usual procedure was that when an action was imminent, two mahailas were tied to the sides of the river steamer, which contained the fighting troops. The Turks often complained of this misuse of the Red Cross. The ma hailas could not be sent down river until the river steamer was avail able. Thus at the battle of Wadi the wounded were evacuated to steamers and mahailas at Shaikh Saad on the 13th. They moved up river for the battle of Hanna on the 21st January, and then when the boats were full they were able to proceed to Basra. The first river hospital steamer allotted to Force ' D /? , the Ben gali,' was provided by private enterprise and foundered at sea in February 1915. Nothing adequate was done to replace her. The first hospital river steamer the ' Sikkim ' began to ply about April 1916. She took away the casualties from Kut after the surrender. As regards hospitals on shore, no B. S. H. accompanied the force to Mesopotamia. In March 1915 the fighting troops had doubled in strength, yet no additional stationary, clearing or general hospitals were sent out from India. Moreover these reinforcements bad arrived without field ambulances. The A.H.Q. diaries contain many references to medical matters, but somehow nothing emerged from this phase of discussion into the realities of action. By February 1916 the force under General Aylmer had increased to two divisions and a cavalry brigade. Except for the arrival of 7 sections of field ambulances the medical units sufficed for one division only. On the whole hospital comforts were adequate at Basra, though there were no fans till 1916, but want of shipping made their distribution above the base almost impossible. In 1915 instructions were issued to the troops as to how to treat cases of heat stroke with ice baths. But ice could only be obtained in the hospitals at Basra. It must be re membered that the temperature reached 125 degrees and more in the -78 shade, and shade was scanty even in the palm groves. It was non existent in the plains of Es Sinn. Yet till the crisis of Ctesiphon, the medical arrangements worked fairly satisfactorily. The medical authorities could point out the com paratively low sick rate in 1915. It was not till 1916 that the real har vest of disease was reaped. This state of affairs can be accounted for by five reasons : (1) Iwiprovisation. In this India excels. When either through fear of asking or through refusals of their requests, the medical authorities did not get what they required, fresh organizations were improvised. At a stroke of the pen hospital accommodation was increased from 200 to 600 beds. Field ambulances retained their casualties instead of evacuating them directly. River steamers were used as hospital- ships. After Ctesiphon the ' Mosul ' was thus used though it had no hospital fittings and only one medical officer. (2) Owing to lack of shipping, not all the troops could be employed at once. Thus a portion of the force could' always be at rest in the severe climatic conditions of the country. (3) The efficiency with which measures against epidemic diseases were carried out. The Mesopotamian Commission Report gives un stinted praise to the medical authorities for their efforts to combat malaria, scurvy, etc. (4) The great efforts of the medical executive officers who never spared themselves. (5) Regular troops and good discipline which resulted in good sani tary arrangements. What were the reasons for the breakdown of the transport, supply and medical services in this campaign ? Firstly the root of the evil lay in our failure to square political ends with our military means. At the beginning we had no clear vision of Baghdad, but followed a patch work policy, which grew ever more ambitious. The force from the first was ill-found to meet the privations and hardships inseparable from campaigning in Mesopotamia. As General Gorringe said— ' It was believed to be a side show and no man's child.' In the Nile campaign, Gordon's death in Khartum gave our Govern ment a definite objective. Transport, material, troops, were collected in that order and a methodical preparation finally resulted in Omdur- man. The fall of Kut, again, gave us a definite object. The history of the British Empire affords many examples of our policy outrunning our military means. In the Zulu war, for instance, Secocoeni retired to his caves and we had not the guns nor the regular forces to drive him out. The Secretary of State wrote— ' Can Secocoeni be only driven out of his caves by starvation ? Would nou rockets do it or some such appliance ? I suggest cayenne79 pepper. Such a process would be shorter in its operation and more humane.' Secondly, the campaign was controlled by India where the atmos phere was very unfavourable to reform or change. Thirdly, there was no co-ordination of effort between the civil and military authorities. This question had not been satisfactorily settled in England, much less in India. The Indian Government was in no way fitted to control a large expedition overseas. The Directorate of - the R. I. M. was not satisfactorily organized. The civil executive did not understand the difficult climatic conditions of the campaign and the military failed adequately to press for their requirements or to exploit civil resources. This disunity of purpose also is common to many British campaigns. We can trace through all the actions of the Governments a first period during which they were reluctantly learn ing what co-operation meant, a second period in which they were being forced to make such co-operation effectually possible, and finally a third when the hard gained and expensive lesson was put into action with drastic effect. In his book, ' Before the War,' Lord Haldane writes— It is our gift to be able to apply ourselves in emergencies with im mense energy. Our success in promptly pulling ourselves together has often suggested to outside observers that we had long ago looked ahead but were merely inefficient.' It was so in Mesopotamia. The ' ill-found ' expedition with it&amp; preliminary defeats was finally swallowed up in victory.( 80 ) CHAPTER VIIL Administration, Spring 1916. In this chapter the working of the administrative services at the Ifront is dealt with, and their general effect on operations and on the troops in the efforts to relieve Kut. T i ran ' I)0rt ' Distances by river from Basra were :— (1) River. J Amara 3|- days, Shaikh Saad 5 days and Wadi 5-6 days. The round trip from Basra to Wadi took 9-10 days as an average, not including the period necessary for loading and unloading which would double the time. At any given time there were five ships going up river, three ships coming down, four loading and twelve unloading. There was not time for systematic overhaul. Ships remained at work till they broke down and were then temporarily patched up. The shipping had been just sufficient to maintain the 6th Division and attached troops at Ctesiphon. In the retirement a number of barges ;and steamers had been lost. Thus on January 6th, just before the battle of Shaikh Saad Force C£ D ' Headquarters telegraphed to the C. Gr. S. India as follows :— i£ On account of the partial concentration of the reinforcements for the relief of Kut at Ali Gharbi and the insufficiency of river trans port, which is only just enough to permit Aylmer proceeding with his operations and to allow an absolute minimum for the transport from Basra of the required reserve of supplies for this force and the garrison of Kut when relieved, all further reinforcements will have to proceed by route march instead of being conveyed by river. Very severe delay will be entailed by this and the further concentration of the requisite troops for the support of Aylmer's force will in consequence be post poned.' At the time of the battle of Shaikh Saad, when every available man was necessary at the front, seven battalions were waiting for transport at Basra. At the battle of Wadi General Aylmer was urged to send his ships back immediately. But he required them for his advance on Kut if the break-through succeeded. The shipping was, in fact, doing the duty of lines of communication supply units, ambulance convoys -and train.8] By February 14tli ? 1910, the following additional shipping had arrived at Basra :— 2 sternwheelers, 3 paddlers, 2 motor lighters, 1 small river tug and 16 barges. Of the sternwheelers, neither of which could be used for towing, one accommodated 400 troops and 60 tons of supplies, the other 200 men and 50 tons supplies. Of the paddlers, one could not tow and car ried 100 men with no supplies. Another carried 400 troops with 80 tons of supplies. The third was in dock undergoing repairs to damage which had occurred during the voyage and would not be ready for three weeks. Anyhow its accommodation was negligible. The tug carried 200 men and 5 tons of supplies. Thus these five vessels could transport some 240 tons of supplies which was the capacity of one P. boat. To sum up, before Ctesiphon the craft were only just sufficient for two divi sions. In February there were the makings of five divisions in the country and the river transport had not been increased. The troops therefore had to march in spite of the great delay- (2) Land Bridges spanned the rivers at Kurmat Ali Qurna, Qala Salih. The distances by road were :— Basra to Ali G-harbi 14 days and Basra to Shaikh Saad 16 days. The road above Qurna ran close to the left bank and was the first stretch to give way. On January 21st, the river rose seven feet and flooded the right bank. Normally in flood time the waters of the Tigris spill over into the area between the two rivers and inundate the whole country. After 15th March it was unsafe to rely on the land route at all. During this month Arab labour was extensively utilised to streng then the river bunds, but the march of the 13th Division, which began to arrive towards the end of March, was greatly delayed. The practice of marching did not, however, entirely relieve the ship ping. Owing to the shortage of land transport, the train baggage of units was carried on ships which were thus tied to the marching units. The artillery in many cases had to go by river when the roads were im passable for wheels, and horses had to be left behind owing to lack of transport. D. A. Cs. were usually the last to leave Basra, batteries being replenished at the front direct from the ships. For the battles of January all available transport was continually reallotted in order to fit out new formations arriving. The frontal attacks m the ensuing battles were provided with a minimum first line only, as they were near the river. For the flank attacks a meagre train was allotted and as it became emptied it had to be used for collecting the wounded for whom there was no other conveyance. After each .action the transport was reduced in proportion to the casualties in units82 and new units were made mobile. The amount of extra labour thrust on the depleted transport staff by these measures can be imagined. Lastly, the weather added to all other difficulties, the ground became impassable for wheels and wheeled transport had to be turned into pack. By March the situation had become acute. In the operations of March 8th the total fighting strength of the Tigris corps was 25,537 men and 92 guns. The decisive attack against Dujaila was made with 19,000 men and 68 guns, the maximum number which could be pro vided with transport. No provision could be made for the carriage of water nor of anything except minimum rations and ammunition. The containing attack at Hanna was completely immobilised. The cavalry brigade supply section appears to have been the only complete supply unit utilised as such in the January operations. Other Supplies formations were provided with supply sections improvised from personnel available which was at less than a third of its proper strength. For instance at the battle of Wadi there were 9 S. &amp; T. officers instead of 40 with the force. For the actions in January sufficient food was actually available at riverhead, but personnel was insufficient for distribution; and the Bituation became worse as more fighting troops arrived. The system of allotting parent ships was a failure for various reasons, for instance lack of communications between banks ; storms making movement of boats impossible ; shipping sent up river not loaded properly ; tugs not available to move barges from one bank to the other. The reserve ration situation is instructive. Brit. Ind. Fodder. Grain. Fuel. 6th January 1916 . . 33 34 33 16 38 27th January 1916 . . 17 17 18 10 20 That is to say that in 21 days the reserves were depleted 17 days. In the urgency of the situation Headquarters had relied upon victory to open up the rich grain country of the Hai, and the diary states that, ' undoubtedly some risk was incurred.' By the middle of February the reserve rations were down to seven days' supplies and the troops were on half rations. A telegram from Force a D ' to the C. Gr. S. India on 14th February 1916 reads as follows :— ' To keep Aylmer's force supplied with the minimum safe reserve of food and ammunition, and at the same time send up reinforcements, has been our one constant struggle since the commencement of the con centration for the relief of Kut. The urgent need for the despatch of reinforcements has often made it quite impossible to send other auxi liary essentials, i.e., aircraft, medical personnel, bridging material and83 barges. It has oiuy been possible to do what has been done by work ing at maximum pressure day and night all our existing craft, and it is now evident that the pressure cannot continue without a large per centage of the existing ships being laid up.' The capacity of the available craft at this period for the round trip was:— 3,000 tons with troops and 5,000 tons without troops. Taking 4,000 tons as the average and twelve days for the trip, we have an available capacity of 330 tons per diem. This was just suffi cient for the supplies of 3 divisions od a basis of 100 tons per division of 14,000 men. On January 27th the troops rations were reduced. The meat ration was fixed at J lb. preserved meat and 3 oz. cheese or bacon=| lb. preserved meat. On the 29th the cavalry brought in a small supply of cattle sheep and goats, but by this time the fuel situation was becoming acute. Extra supplies of wood had to be issued to the troops to dry their clothes and no fuel was locally obtainable. AVe find Force Headquarters suggesting to India that a corps of sweepers should be enlisted to manufacture cowdung fuel cakes in Mesopotamia. For the battle of Hanna two days' cooked rations were ordered to be carried by the men. Grain and forage for two days were also drawn, but the meagre transport could not possibly carry it. The battle-field was thus strewn with bags of grain and forage. Division, sums up the situation as follows in his diary. ' This expedition started in an unorganized state as far as the S. &amp; T. was concerned. The ships are insufficient and the land transport is inadequate : no supply personnel to speak of. Consequently in spite of all our efforts troops are bound to suffer. I trust that this will be borne in mind when the time comes, for there is bound to be some enquiry into things later.' Throughout 1915 the medical arrangements were moderately effi cient owing to good luok and good management in improvisa- Medical. tion. But matters came to a head at Ctesiphon when casualties were heavily underestimated and 4,500 actually occurred. The one redeeming feature of the medical debacle was that all wounded were evacuated to the river and not left to the mercy of the Arabs. But the state of affairs on the improvised hospitalships was deplorable. In the Medjidieh 600 wounded were on board from 24th December till January btb. Many stretcner cases *ere unattended for these thirteen days and 28 died on the journey from neglect. Broken limbs were provided with splints from bhoosa baling and broken up whiskey84 cases : the latter not too plentiful. On the Mosul there wa&amp; no operating theatre. A shed was improvised on deck out of blankets and palliasses and there surgical cases were operated upon in spite of dust storms. There were not enough men to bury the dead adequately when the ship stopped for the night for the purpose. Succeeding ships reported that Arabs had opened up the shallow graves to strip the bodies. The whole state of affairs was brought to the notice of Force Headquarters by the medical officer of the hospitalship at Basra. He was told that he would be put under arrest and would have his hospital ship taken away from him ' for a meddlesome interfering faddist'. The seniorQ ' officer of the force had been similarly warned by A. H. Q. } Simla, that he would be dismissed if he persisted in his demands for hospital river steamers. We find that not till December 31st, 1915, did the Viceroy first ask for one. At Shaikh Saad medical arrangements were further aggravated by the weather. The medical establishment was at a third of its strengths All ambulances for the 7th division were improvised and two sections were put on board the S. S. &lt;c Julnar.' In Shaikh Saad hospital one temporary I. M. S. officer was in charge of 1,000 sick and wounded. He had no field dressings and there were no latrines. Ten days' atta had been issued to the hospital but it had been soaked by the rain. The men suffered severely from want of food and were dependent on casual fatigue parties which passed on their way to and from the supply ships. At the battle of Wadi matters had not been improved. On the date of General Aylmer's advance not a single complete field ambulance had been disembarked at Basra. A heavy downpour on the 21st made the country a sea of mud. A.T. carts were unable to move and pack trans port brought in the wounded. At this time the nullahs were 3' deep in water and the ground ankle deep in mud. It was bitterly cold and there was a driving sleet. Thus the train transport was diverted from its legitimate duty to bring in wounded during the night. Stretcher parties worked for long distances but instances occurred of stretcher cases and stretcher bearers dying from exposure on their way to hospital from the firing line. To sum up, the causes of the medical breakdown in the early days of the relief operations were :— (1) No properly fitted hospital river steamers. (2) Lack of river and land transport. (3) Insufficiency of medical personnel. (4) Bad weather. (5) Time. (6) Lack of medical comforts and supplies.85 By Marcli the medical arrangements had improved though the A.T., cart was still the only available vehicle to carry the wounded. Apart from this method of torturing the wounded the evacuation of casualties from Dujaila to Wadi worked smoothly. By April medical organi zation was as near normal as the hardships of the campaign and the lack of appliances would allow. In view of all these facts, it is not surprising to find that frequent allusions are made to the morale of the troops. It was reported that the number of self-inflicted wounds among the Indian troops was alarm ing. Very few convictions as a result of courts martial are recorded and it appears that a good deal of unjust suspicion was roused. The 3rd and 7th divisions had gone through the severe fighting of France and were full of recruits and reserve officers. In many cases drafts arrived from their depots almost totally untrained. Faith was pinned on the 13th British Division which was to come from Egypt. But this formation had gone through Gallipoli and was full of partially trained men. It was new to the country, the administrative difficulties and climatic conditions, and it did not come up to expectation. One more fact perhaps had its effect on morale. The campaign had now been in progress some 18 months. One small list of honours had been published, but not a single despatch had appeared in the press. In February Headquarters wired to A.H.Q., India, that a long list of French and Belgian decorations had just been published and that Force 44 D ' seemed to be neglected. Yet the campaign in Mesopotamia had been the one bright spot in the British effort of the war till this time. The advance to Baghdad had been sanctioned by the Cabinet to neutralise the lack of success in other theatres. On the eve of his advance Lieut.-General F. J. Aylmer, v.c., k.c.b., had wired to Force Headquarters. u After consulting Major-Generals G. J. Younghusband, k.c.m.g., k.c.i.e., c.b ., and G. V. Kemball, c.b., d.s.o ., I determined to continue the advance on Kut, but it is my distinct duty to point out that it is a most hazardous undertaking, for which I, of course, accept full responsibility, as I consider the situation demands a supreme effort to relieve Townshend My medical establishments, as you may calculate, are deplorably low and wounded cannot receive proper attention. Even if it is necessary to remove fighting men from the ships, more must be sent up at once. I have only one aeroplane in action.... 99 Force cc D ' Headquarters replied : I must leave the matter to your decision. Am confident that you and the fine troops under your command will achieve your object. J&gt; It is instructive to see how the Turkish administrative arrangements fared. The enemy had five large river steamers of the Medjidieh class besides mahailas. But they had the great advantage of the stream and86 made extensive use of rafts (keleks) and coracles (gufas). The former €Ould carry up to one company with some transport. At Shumran they were broken up into their component parts of poles and skins and these were returned to Baghdad on donkeys. Camel, donkey and mule convoys supplied the troops at the front and large supplies of grain and meat on hoof were drawn from Badra and the Hai area. The staple food of the Turk consisted of an exceedingly hard baked biscuit, alleged to be nutritious, and dates. However, in spite of their advantages, the Turkish troops were on a low scale of rations and typhus was pre valent.CHAPTER IX. The battle of Shaikh Saad. By Major-General Sir W. D. Bird, K.B.E., (IB., C.M.G., D.S.O. {This narrative is based on the war diaries, to which I was most kindly permitted to have access. I was also able to consult 'My Campaign in Mesopotamia,' by Major-General Sir Charles Townshend.) Before the advance on Baghdad was undertaken by the 6th Indian Division, the 6th Cavalry Brigade and other troops, under General Townshend, towards the end of November 1915, a promise had been made by the Government that the 3rd and 7th Indian Divisions would, after some exchanges with Indian units that were serving in be transferred from France to Mesopotamia. Although it was expected that these troops would begin to arrive in the country early in December, the situation created by the result of the battle of Ctesiphon was considered to be so serious that General Nixon, who was Comman der-in-Chief in Mesopotamia was informed that the 34th and 35th Indian Infantry Brigades, three Field Batteries, one regiment of Indian Cavalry and one company of Sappers and Miners would be despatched forthwith from India to Mesopotamia, embarking at Bombay between the 2nd and 6th December. Sir John Nixon who had been at the front, had gone after the action back to Basra for the purpose of supervising the despatch up the Tigris of these reinforcements. But before their arrival Townshend had fallen back to and shut himself up in Kut-al-Amara, after sending down river the 6th Cavalry Brigade, which met the first of the reinforcements from France and Egypt, the 28th Infantry Brigade, under General Young- husband, on the 9th December at Ali-Gharbi. About 16,000 fighting men belonging to a cavalry and camelry brigade and the 35th, 38th, 45th and 51st Turkish Divisions, accom panied by a number of Arabs, closed in on the 7th December on the force under Townshend, which consisted of about 12,200 men of whom 2,200 were in hospital. From the 10th to the 13th December the enemy pressed the garrison so hard that Townshend felt obliged to telegraph to Nixon in regard to his anxiety lest the ammunition should prove to be inadequate ; and he also expressed the hope that the place would be relieved within ten or fifteen days. For some time after their activity on the 10th to the 13th December the Turks remained comparatively quiet, either because of their losses or because they were awaiting the arrival of reinforcements.* After * Apparently the 52nd division reached the front in this interval, ( 87 ) ggapping forward close to the fort, a small work on tlie right of the British line of defence, the enemy made a violent assault on it during the 24th and 25th December, in the presence of the German Field Marshal Von der Goltz, which was repulsed. The Turks now converted the siege into a blockade, and on the 27th Townshend telegraphed that they had drawn back, relaxing their hold on the town, that their forces had been placed astride the Tigris, and that it appeared as if the enemy's object was to entrench a position for defence against the relieving force. The reports which had been received from Townshend appeared to render the early relief of his force a matter of necessity, and in view of the very serious shortage of river transport available for the British m Mesopotamia, it was fortunate that orders had already been given for the construction of a raised roadway * along the Shatt-al-Arab and Tigris from Basra to Amara. In general it was now the policy of Sir John Nixon first to provide a force to cover the arrival and movement of reinforcements up river by sending forward certain units by steamer. He would also despatch by ship the reinforcements that were to be moved to strengthen the detachment which was holding Nasiriya. Other troops that were to form part of the corps which was destined to attempt the relief of Kut-al-Amara, would, as they arrived at Basra, proceed by march route to Amara. Units which reached the country too late to be able to march would be moved to the front in the river flotila, and mean while the shipping would be used for the movement of supplies and material to Amara and other places where depots would be formed. Roughly speaking the time required for the voyage of a steamer t with troops from Basra to Amara was three and a half days, and Amara was one day's steaming from Ali-Gharbi. The distance from Basra to Ali- Gharbi could not be covered in less than fourteen days by marching, and the time that would be occupied in moving a party by road from Basra to Amara was estimated as about ten days. General Aylmer, who had been nominated to command the Tigris Corps of two divisions and other troops, as the relieving force had been named, had meanwhile also been pushing forward at Amara the arrangements for the advance. On the 19th and 22nd December secret instructions were issued giving the number of troops which it was hoped to concentrate at Ali-Gharbi ; that supplies for one month would, if possible, be taken up river, as well as horses and high explosive and shrapnel shell for the garrison of Kut-al-Amara ; and that the field service scale of transport, without tents, would be * There were no metalled roads in Southern Mesopotamia ; such as existed were mere tracks over the plain where scrub had been cleared and ramps made in the banks of dry canals and channels. t As a rule a barge was lashed to each side of a steamer, and a vessel, with its 'baro-es, could carry from 500 to 800 infantry, or a battery, or about three troops of cavalry.89 adopted for the troops, but that requirements for the carriage of tents should also be submitted. The corps would probably be organized as one division with corps ftroop^, but this organisation was not in fact followed in the first instance. The former, the 7th Division, under General Younghusband, would com prise the 19th, 21st and 28th Infantry Brigades, the 16th Cavalry (less (One squadron), the 107th Pioneers, the 3rd or 4th Company of Sappers .and Miners, the 9th Field Artillery Brigade of eighteen 18-pounders s the «61st Field Howitzer Battery of six 4*5 inch howitzers, and other units. The Corps Tropj^ were to consist of the 35th and 9th Infantry Brigades, .one squadroja (Oi the 16th Cavalry, the 1-lst Sussex Territorial Field Battery of iour Impounders, two sections of the 23rd Mountain Battery, the 72nd and 77th Heavy Howitzer Batteries, each of four 5-inch howit zers, one -section of the 104th Heavy Battery of 4-inch guns, two pro visional battalions composed of drafts for the units in Kut-al-Amara, ;the 13th Company of Sappers and Miners, a squadron of the Flying vCorps and Signal and Administrative formations. The 6th Cavalry .Brigade would include the 14th King's Hussars, the 4th Cavalry, the .7th Lancers, the 33rd Cavalry (one or more squadrons had been detached irom the 7th and 33rd), two sections of S. Battery Horse Artillery and Signal and Administrative units. Subsequently General Younghusband was informed that units as they reached Ali-Gharbi were to be so en- scamped as to facilitate an advance by the 7th Division and Cavalry Brigade up the right bank of the Tigris, and by the remainder up the ieft bank of the river. Owing to the prevalence of strong winds at Christmas time it had not .been practicable until the 27th December to make a reconnaissance with .either of the two British aeroplanes that were then available. On this ♦ date it was ascertained that there were 100 tents at Shaikh Saad (a tent .might accommodate twenty-five men), that the camps near Kut-al- Amara were somewhat larger than had been the case before, and that a bridge of boats, with ramped approaches was in position at the southern iportion of the Shumran bend ; it was moved subsequently to the western portion. On the next day Townshend reported that the Turks were busily entrenching on the right bank of the Tigris to the west of Kut-al-Amara, and that at least a division (that is from 3,000 to 6,000 men) with a considerable quantity of transport had marched past the town and was bivouacking on the left bank three miles to the north-east * of the fort. General Aylmer now sent an enquiry to General Townshend as to 4}he number of troops that would be available, out of his garrison to co- .operate with the Tigris Corps on the 10th January. Townshend had already forwarded a message that, on the 27th December, the effective .strength of the garrison in combatants was 6,764 infantry, 1,051 artillery, (x %90 439 sappers and miners and 204 signal service, or a total of 8,698, besides a couple of hundred cavalry. He now telegraphed by wireless that it: was understood from prisoners that the 36th division was following the 52nd division which was known to have arrived at Kut-al-Amara, 'We have,' he continued, ' quite sufficient numbers here upon us as it is without this extra division ; I am sure you do not require my reasons for my serious anxiety on the score of any more reinforcements reaching the enemy. I hope if you start on January 3rd, as I under stand you do, that you will get here much sooner than January 10th.' At the end of the telegram there was a request for information as to the strength of the relieving force, and as to the movements of the Russians, who had detached troops from the army of the Caucasus- to co-operate with the British by advancing through Persia on. Baghdad. It was not until two days later that a statement was despatched that only some 5,000 rifles and certain guns would be available to support the operations of the Tigris Corps. It was also pointed out that the garrison did not possess the means of bridging the Tigris but that there were about fifty native barges (mahailas) which could be used with his single river steamer, a tug, for the transporta tion of troops to the right bank of the river, and rafts could also be improvised for this purpose. Sir Fenton Aylmer took a day to consider General Townshend's appeal for the early relief of the garrison, but at once replied to the request for news. The commander of the 6th Division was informed, that the composition of the relieving column would be about two divi sions and a cavalry brigade. The Russian force that was operating in. Persia under General Baratoff consisted of about 15,000 troops, who were mainly cavalry, with 14 guns and more than 100 motor lorries. This force had split up into a number of columns one of which would advance as quickly as possible on Kermanshah. On the 30th December General Aylmer addressed a most pertinent review of the situation both to Sir John Nixon and to General Town- shend. After pointing out the disadvantages that were evidently in volved in a hurried advance, and observing that the date which had. been mentioned had been put forward after a conservative estimate of the factors, he stated that he was, however, prepared to incur great risks in order to render assistance to the garrison of Kut-al-Amara in case of imperative necessity. By far the best plan of action, he con tinued. would be to carry out an advance from Shaikh Saad with the whole corps, and in any case it was essential to put off as long as possible the adoption of any particular project, since hurry must connote ineffi ciency. In conclusion General Townshend was asked to give full weight: to these considerations before fixing a definite date on which the relief; must be effected.91 Sir Jolm Nixon concurred with General Aylmer in giving preference r to the method of methodical advance in force, unless it became imperative 'to effect the relief of the garrison. General Townshend did not immediately send a direct reply to this appeal, but telegraphed that cases of self-mutilation, and of sleeping b/ sentries when on their posts, were occurring among the garrison, that documents calling on the Indian soldiers to rise and overpower their officers had been fixed by the enemy on the wire in front of our trenches, and that some soldiers had been overheard using seditious language ia the town of Kut-al-Amara. But, on the 1st January, 1916, he tele graphed that the Turks seemed to be turning the siege into a blockade, and that only in the case of the direct necessity would an appeal be made for immediate assistance from the relieving force. General Aylmer therefore continued his preparations with the design of undertaking a forward movement early in January. Since their arrival at Ali-Gharbi the troops under General Young- nusband had hardly been molested except for intermittent firing into the camp by night, although a few Turkish Cavalry had, about the 21st December, appeared in support of the Arab horsemen who, as usual, hung about the area occupied by the British. On the 31st December General Younghusband had been warned that the 7th Division and Cavalry Brigade might be required to advance from Ali- Gharbi on the 3rd January, but next day, owing to the immense amount of preparatory work still to be completed, it was decided to postpone the forward movement until the 4th. Aylmer reached Ali-Gharbi on the 2nd January, and on the 3rd issued written instructions to General Younghusband. In these Younghusband was informed that the first echelon of the corps was placed under his orders, and was to begin to move forward on the 4th January advancing on the following days as far as the neighbourhood of Shaikh Saad. Although it was possible that conditions in Kut-al-Amara might become so serious to oblige the first echelon to push on from Shaikh Saad without awaiting the arrival of leinforcements, it was not at the moment anticipated that such a con tingency would arise. In no circumstances, however, was General Younghusband to go forward from Shaikh Saad without direct orders irom General Aylmer. Fiom the information, continued General Aylmer, that had been obtained by the cavalry and airmen and from other sources, it was esti mated that the Turkish army now consisted of the 35th* Division, 2,500 fighting men ; the 38th Division, 2,500 fighting men ; the 45th Division, 3,500 fighting men ; the 51st Division, 6,500 fighting men ; the 52nd c and 3 1 8th divi ? ions wer3 composed mainly of Arab personnel; tlw 45th bad suttered 3,500 casualties at the battle of Ctesiphon; the 51st and 52nd were Turkish divK sions which had arrived m the country, the iirst just before, the other after this battle.T ■j| 92 Division, 7 ,500 fighting men or 22,500 in all. The enemy possessed 72 guns, of whicli 35 were quick-firing field guns, 19 quick-firing mountain guns, 13 old pattern field guns, 5 heavy guns and 2 howitzers. It was believed that there were in the neighbourhood of Shaikh Saad 1,100 Turkish camelmen, 900 cavalry, 2 small guns, 2 or more machine gun&amp; and perhaps an infantry battalion. On the other hand it was not im possible that the enemy division which has been seen to move east wards past Kut-al-Amara, on the 28th December might have reached Shaikh Saad&lt; and if so the bulk of these troops would probably be found on the left bank of the Tigris. The enemy had, however, trans ferred a couple of guns on rafts across the Tigris at a point below Kut- al-Amara. The main body of the Turkish army was apparently round Kut-al-Amara but there were some troops in the Sinn positions to the east of the town. It seemed therefore probable that, if Younghusband were obliged to hasten to the relief of the place, he would find the enemy in position astride the Tigris to oppose his advance. General Young- husband was also warned that the Arabs on both banks of the Tigris above Ali-Gharbi might on the whole be regarded as hostile to the British. In conclusion directions were given as to the flights that were to be made by the aeroplanes for purposes of reconnaissance after the- arrival of the troops at Shaikh Saad ; and it was stated that General Aylmer hoped to bring the second echelon, or remainder of the Corps,, forward from Ali-Gharbi on the 6th January. On the 3rd January Aylmer received a telegram from General Head quarters in which the situation was reviewed by the Commander-in- Chief. Sir John Nixon now estimated the strength of the relieving force as 15,000 bayonets, 1,500 sabres and 46 guns or perhaps from 18,500 to. 19,000 fighting men. On the right bank of the Tigris and nine miles to* the west of Kut-al-Amara he placed the 45th and 36th Turkish Divisions,, aggregating 11,500 fighting men with 41 guns. The 51st, 52nd and 38th Divisions were, it was reckoned, on the left bank of the river and engaged in the investment of Kut-al-Amara, and their fighting strength was estimated as 12,900 men with 24 guns. Lower down the left bank, and possibly at the Sinn position, was the 35th Division of 2,500' fighting men with 18 guns. At Shaikh Saad on both banks of the Tigris^ there were four battalions of gendarmerie, 300 cavalry and 1,200 camel- men. These estimates—the total amounted to about 30,000 fighting men with 83 guns—were, it was pointed out, based on maxima, especially as regards guns ; but all of the enemy's divisions, except the 36th (which, if it had come up, had recently arrived at the front) had been severely handled in action * by our men, and their morale must have been - The 35th and 38th Divisions had been defeated in the earlier battles of the cam paign; ihe 46Mi bad lost heavily at Ctesiphon, the 51st had fought in this battle, and the 52nd iiad apparently made the abortive attack on the fort at Kut-al-Amara. f ■ liWaffected unfavourably. Sir John considered that it was more likely that the Turks would concentrate their forces for battle to the west of Kut-al-Amara rather than afford the British the opportunity of defeating them in the localities downstream. After having effected the relief of Kut-al-Amara Aylmer was consequently instructed to throw up entrenchments in the vicinity of the town, and to await the arrival of reinforcements before taking further aggressive action. Next day, however. General Aylmer was asked to consider whether, in view of the strength of the Turkish army, it would not be wiser, after having joined hands with General Townshend, to fall back on Shaikh Saad, and there await the remainder of his army corps. It is certainly difficult, in view of what actually occurred and of the estimates of the enemy's forces that had been made by the British com manders, to understand their confidence in the early relief of Kut-al- Amara. The tactical balance of advantage., so far as the ground was concerned, inclined strongly to the side of troops whose object it would be to prevent the junction of the two British forces ; and, owing to the absence of drinkable water, except in the Tigris, and to the lack of land transport in the Tigris Corps, it would be difficult for the British to redress the balance by means of manoeuvre, for they would be tied to the vicinity of the river. General Townshend's troops were enclosed in a loop of the Tigris. The narrow land frontage would no doubt be easy to hold against an attack, but it could just as easily be secured by the enemy against a sortie, so that only a small force would be necessary to cany out the investment. The neighbourhood of Kut-al-Amara was such as to afford a besieging army, unusual facilities for checking and delaying any forces that might advance up the Tigris to the relief of the garrison. It is true that the Turkish troops would be fighting astride a river three hundred yards wide, and possibly without the means of direct commu nication between the divided groups. Food and ammunition would also have to be sent to them by land, since river traffic could be stopped by the force holding Kut-al-Amara, and transportation was not, as a rule,, efficiently organized in the Turkish army. On the other hand from Sannaiyat, fifteen miles away to Hanna, twenty-five miles distant from the town, the space between the Tigris and the Suwaikiya marsh was not more than a mile in width ; and the marsh, although not impassable by men on foot, could not be crossed by a force of all arms, and was so extensive as practically to prohibit an advance round it. To the west of Sannaiyat also lay the Sinn position, which had been held by the enemy at the battle of Kut-^l-Amara. The ground on the right bank of the Tigris and to the east of the Hai was so much broken by canals and channels, which had either fallen into disuse or were still employed, during the flood season, that delaying action would be facilitated ; and here too lay the right of the Sinn position. Portions of the Turkish army, such94 as the 35tli, 38tli and 45th Divisions, were no doubt not highly efficient. But when on the defensive weakness as regards training and morale are, on t e whole, of less importance tiian when attacking, for cohesive move ment is more difficult and demands higher qualifications than are required to maintain a position. Moreover a force so hastily brought together as that under General Aylmer, must evidently be wanting in the unity of purpose which is so important an element of power when attacking * Again the bulk of the troops had been accustomed to the very different conditions of trench warfare, and the heavy losses that had been experi enced by the units which had served in France had necessarily reduced their fighting efficiency. A high wind, accompanied by rain, prevented the airmen from flying on tho 3rd January, but a report came in from Arab sources of the pre sence of 4,000 Turkish infantry on the left bank of the Tigris opposite Hibsh, four or five miles below Shaikh Saad, and of horsemen on oth banks of the river ; and there were also rumours as to the presence of infantry above Shaikh Saad at the Wadi. In addition on the 4th General Townshend sent a message that two enemy divisions which had moved in a north-easterly direction past Kut-al-Amara on the evening of the 3rd, had not made an attempt to attack the garrison, and had perhaps marched on to the Sinn position (on the left bank). Later in the day it was reported by him that another column of from 2,000 to 3,000 infantry, with six guns and a squadron of cavalry, had marched eastwards, and that a marked reduction was visible in the size of the Turkish camps on the right bank of the Tigris above the town of Kut-al- Amara. As a result General Aylmer telegraphed to Sir John Nixon that it did not appear as if the enemy would raise the siege without a serious struggle at some locality below Kut-al-Amara, and that subsequentlv a second position might be occupied to the west of this place. The diffi culty of arranging for the supply of forces pushed to the east of Kut might cause the Turks to postpone the actual occupation of a position below the town ; but so far as numbers were concerned it appeared as if they would be able both to invest the troops under Townshend and engage the relieving force in the Sinn positions with superior numbers. At the same time General Younghusband, who had advanced to Kubar with the Cavalry Brigade, the 28th and 35th Infantry Brigades 'j* and other troops, and was astride the Tigris, was informed that punitive detachments were not to be made against certain Arab villages, the inhabitants of which had molested British shipping ; and he was told ■that, in view of the fact that it might be necessary to pause in some For some reason the divisional and other staffs and the various administrative vices were among the last of the unit to reach Mesopotamia from France. f He was subsequently joined by the 19th Infantry Brigade.95 locality to the east of Kut-al-Amara and there await reinforcements, .measures were to be taken to choose and entrench a position at Shaikh Saad. During the 5th January Aylmer telegraphed to General Head quarters suggesting that the Commander of the 12th Division, should be ordered to advance from Nasiriya for a short distance 4ip the Shatt-al-Hai, or if possible as far as Shatrat, in order to relieve the strain which was being imposed on the Tigris Corps. It was pro posed that reports should be spread that an important movement had been undertaken, and the troops should act so as to give colour to them. Telegrams, in a cipher which could easily be unravelled by the enemy, were also to be sent to Townshend as regards the advance of a British force up the Hai to Kut-al-Amara in the hope of adding to the illusion. Sir John fell in with these proposals, and Gorringe received instructions ito advance with a force of all arms for one day's march up the Hai. He was authorised also to call up certain units from Qurna should he &gt;coDsider this to be necessary. General Younghusband moved to the eastern portion of the Musandaq reach on the 5th January, small bodies of enemy cavalry being en- f countered on both banks of the Tigris. During the day reports came in to General Aylmer's headquarters from General Headquarters that ^according to news which had been received from agents, Nur-ud-din .Pasha, who was in command of the forces near Kut-al-Amara, could dispose of 30,000 fighting men with 40 guns ; and that, in spite of rumours of the movement of Turkish troops down the Euphrates, armed Arabs only were as yet in the field in this portion of the theatre of war. ^General Townshend also sent a statement that a column from five to six miles in length, and comprising 8,000 fighting men was in movement down the left bank of the Tigris ; that the Turkish camps on the right- bank had disappeared from the areas above Kut-al-Amara, while that on the left bank was reduced in size. A Turkish aeroplane flew over Younghusband's column at noon. The result of the British aerial reconnaissance, which was carried out from Ali-Gharbi at about midday, disclosed the fact that there was more than an advanced guard at Shaikh Saad, for it was computed that some 10,500 men had been seen in its vicinity, and there were entrenchments on both banks of the Tigris near Hibsh. From this information it might be assumed that the Turks intended to fight a battle, although the position of their light which lay parallel to the course taken by the Tigris above Shaikh Saad was somewhat un favourable, and General Aylmer proceeded therefore to revise his plans. Younghusband was in consequence posted as to the situation in a tele gram which came to hand at 2COO and he was warned that there were indications of the presence of a force at Shaikh Saad considerably larger96 than an advanced guard, that at least 10,500 troops had been seen, and that 8,000 might come up on the left bank of the Tigris during the 6th January and fall on the British at the end of an indecisive engagement. He was told that the Corps commander did not desire to run the risk of even a modified check at Shaikh Saad and he was directed, therefore,, to hold the enemy in their positions tvith sufficient vigour to cause the Turks to show their hand, pending the arrival of the remainder of the column, which would reach the eastern end of the Musandaq reach on the evening of the 6th January. A bridge was to be thrown across- the Tigris at or near, the positions gained on the 6th by Young- husband's troops.; and information was to be supplied of the presence of any marshes that would interfere with manoeuvres to outflank the enemy. In acknowledging these orders Younghusband observed that he could not obtain news of the existence of well made entrenchments near Shaikh Saad, and thought, therefore, that it was the enemy's intention to fall back. He believed also that the Turks had only a small number of guns whereas we were strong in artillery. An advance, he said, would be made at 0830 on the 6th January, along both banks of the Tigris, and steps would be taken to clear up the situation and pin the Turks - to their position, should they hold it. If all went well the troops of the: first echelon would push on to Shaikh Saad, and there await the arrival of Aylmer with the second echelon. A bridge would be thrown as far forward as was compatible with safety. The meaning of words is interpreted in conformity with the images; that they evoke in the mind, but, as words can only give imperfect expression to what is thought, it is often most difficult accurately to convey the meaning that is desired. General Aylmer appears to have intended that the force under Younghusband should follow the proce dure indicated for an advanced guard, and limit its action to the securing of tactical points which might assist in the development of the attack by the main body. This is always far from being an easy task ; for when once troops are launched in attack it is hard to draw the line evenly between the feebleness which fails so to press the enemy as to force him to disclose his strength and positions, and the undue daring which in- - volves the troops irreparably in a close combat. But when, as was the case in Mesopotamia, the ground is brown, absolutely fiat and except for the Tigris and the dry channels leading from it, featureless, and is in places covered with the low banks of disused irrigation works and small scrub, and when even near objects are shrouded in haze or distorted by mirage, concealment is made so simple for the enemy that limited but effective action on the part of an advanced guard is almost impossible- It seems, however, that General Younghusband had taken a somewhat different view of the task that had been given to him, for he speaks of :holding the enemy to their position. It was, therefore, apparently his intention to follow the general principle outlined in the Field Service Kegulations, Part 1, 1909, for the conduct of a battle ; where it is stated, ' that the enemy must be engaged in sufficient strength to pin him to his ground, and to wear down his power of resistance, while the force allotted to the decisive attack should be as strong as possible.' General Aylmer made no reply to the telegram sent by his subordi nate, and presumably therefore it was accepted as satisfactory. In a message that was received from Greneral Townshend on the 5th, the total number of Turkish troops engaged in the investment of Kut-al- Amara and in opposing its relief was estimated to amount only to 20,000 fighting men with 32 guns. It was stated, further, that a minimum of from 4,000 to 5,000 troops would probably be required to maintain the blockade of the town. General Townshend, however, had already reported the eastward march away from Kut-al-Amara of five columns of troops, one on the 28th December being estimated at 3,000 fighting men, two others, each of a division, on the 3rd January, a force of from 2,000 to 3,000 fighting men on the 4th January, and finally a body of 8,000 men. on the 5th January. If these estimates are accepted as being approxi mately correct from 16,000 to 20,000 men, including cavalry, must there fore already have moved away from Kut-al-Amara. According to the computations that had been made by the staff at General Headquarters, 30,000 was the maximum of the enemy's strength, hence not more than 10,000 Turks can now have been round the town ; while according to General Townshend's own estimates the number was very much lower. General Aylmer's operations, then, had to all appearance so far eased the situation of the garrison that the danger of a successful assault by the enemy had, for the time being, become remote ; although there was the possibility that the movements undertaken by the Turks were part of an elaborate scheme to throw General Townshend off his guard, and that these troops were still within easy reach of Kut-al-Amara. The various problems that have been set forth in the preceding para graphs were of sufficient difficulty to tax the resources of the ablest minds, but they formed a tithe only of those which occupied General Mxon and Aylmer and their staffs ; for their energies were already over burdened with the tremendous task of the hasty improvisation of a relieving force that faced them after the investment of Kut-al-Amara. It must, therefore, have be^n as hard then as it is easy now to perceive that the situation had probably been changed in radical fashion by the movements of the enemy, and that, at the moment, the most important questioi; was not whether tbe garrison of Kut-al-Angara could sustain another assault, but whether its supplies,* as was later shown to be * It was apparently believed at this juncture that full rations were available for the garrison until the end of January.9S practicable, could be stretched out until the arrangements for the relief Jiad been fully completed. It is true that it the British made an immediate advance thev might be able to engage and defeat the enemy before the arrival of the body -of 8,000 men' that was said to have marched eastwards from Kut-al- Amara on the 5th January. But the later experience of the war had tended to show that such rapid victory was no longer to be expected ; and it might be concluded, therefore, that the Turks would probably be able to complete their concentration before the British gained a definite advantage vn a battle fought on the 6th January. The force that had been confided to General Aylmer was, as has been observed, still some what raw. Only one of the infantry brigades, the 35th from India, was composed of the units of which it had originally been formed or possessed its proper staff, the commanders were without intimate knowledge of each other's respective characteristics, and the troops were not acquainted with their leaders. The signal and other services had been improvised. It was desirable, therefore, to proceed with caution and to take every possible measure requisite for the attainment of success. It seems, then, that the cause of the British would have been better served had General Aylmer at least concentrated at the Musandaq reach on the 6th the whole of the troops now available, and subsequently undertaken a careful recon naissance of the enemy's position before fixing a plan of action. The Turks would certainly be allowed more time in which to throw up en trenchments, but it was all to the good that they should have advanced so far to meet the British ; for serious trouble must soon be experienced in providing for the maintenance of the enemy's forces at so great a ^distance from their advanced base at Shumran, and an opportunity might then occur of attacking them in difficulties. Prior to the receipt of the latest of the instructions from Sir Fenton Aylmer, General Younghusband had decided on the course of action to be followed by his troops on the 6th. He contemplated that the first echelon should march to Shaikh Saad, and his plan of action was to threaten the enemy's left and at the same time to envelop and drive the forces that were on the right bank of the Tigris into the angle which is formed by its course at Shaikh Saad. It was hoped, further, that a successful advance on the right bank would subsequently enable the British to enfilade the enemy's positions on the left bank of the river, and so render them untenable. After explaining his intentions to the commanders of brigades. Sir George issued orders that the British force was to advance on Shaikh Saad at 0830 on the 6th January. On the right bank, under General Kemball, who had been transferred from the staff to an executive command, there would be the 28th Infantry Brigade, comprising the 2nd Leicestershires, 51st and 53rd Sikhs and 56th Punjabi Eifles, one troop from the Cavalry Brigade, the99 9th Field Artillery Brigade, consisting of the 19th, 20th and 28th Field Batteries and an ammunition column, half of the 13th Sappers and Miners, the 128th Pioneers (less one company) and three sections of Field Ambulances. The 6th Cavalry Brigade consisting of two sections of S. Battery Horse Artillery, the 14th Hussars, the 4th Cavalry, the 33rd Cayalry (less detachments at Kut-al-Amara and Nasiriya) and the Signal, Ammunition and Ambulance units, was to operate on the left of the 28th Infantry Brigade group. On the left bank there- would be under Brigadier-General G. B. H. Rice, the 35th Infantrv Brigade comprising the l-5th Territorial Battalion of the Buffs, 37th Dogras, 97th Infantry and 102nd Grenadiers ; the 16th Cavalry (less one squadron), the 1-1 Sussex Territorial Field Battery, one company of the- 128th Pioneers and two sections of Field Ambulances. One mile behind the fighting troops of this group, a reserve group would inarch under Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Dennys, consisting of the 19th Infantry Brigade which included the 1st Seaforth Highlanders, 28th and 92nd Punjabis and 125th Napier's Eifles ; and the Heavy Artillery Brigade, in which ^ 77tl1 IIeavy Howitzer Batteries, and one section of the- 104th Heavy Battery. The second line transport of the groups was to- follow at a distance of two miles in rear of the last fighting unit on each bank of the river. General Younghusband himself would be in the river gunboat Gadfly, carrying one 4-inch gun and two Maxims, and would be accompanied by a sister ship the Cranefly ; and on the river there would «-so be the Bridging Train, and the following small river steamers carrv- fLb ^ ST' TrVl aminU1Utlon and : the Blos'se Lynch, P. 3, P. 6, and the Julnar, which was to be used as a hospital. abolf^fono 0f %hti f 0fficers and mei1 011 Iand amounted to- !bou 0 000 fT ^ f maClline gUnS ; aild 0f the P™el about 10,000 were infantry, and 1,450 cavalry, but of the latter only 1,250 were with the Cavalry Brigade. The guns consisted of eight 5-inch. ^ eigh,een i8 - i&gt;oimdm ''»» 1 '-o Sir George Younghusband's instructions were not modified after the receipt of General Aylmer's message, since the commander of the first echelon considered that the intentions of his superior could best b. ful- Ued by containing the Turkish for jes on the left bank and opening the way for decisive action against the weaker and isolated right wing of the- enemys Army. General Younghusband proposed, then, to commit Sir Fenton Aylmer to a definite plan of action, whether it was a good or bad plan is immaterial, whereas m the Corps Commander's telegram it wa- as has been show, definitely stated ; ' My orders are therefore that you hold the enemy to his position with sufficient vigour to make him his hand until mv arrival with the remainder of Corps/'100 General Younghiisband had so disposed his force that, on the right bank of the Tigris, there were about 1,250 cavalry, 4,000 infantry, eighteen 18-pounders, four 13-pounders and 22 machine guns, while the troops on the left bank numbered 6,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, eight 5-inch howitzers, two 4-inch guns, four 15-pounders, ancl 24 machine guns. When two r equal and equally well armed forces meet in battle the art of tactics lies, as a rule, in measures to bring superior numbers, guns, etc., to bear on some portion of the enemy's line and if possible, from two directions, and this generally involves steps to hold fast the remainder of his army with a relatively weak detachment. General Younghusband believed that weaker force of the enemy was on the right bank, and seems, there fore, to have considered that about half of the British group would be able effectively to deal with this portion, while the rest would be required to keep off the larger part of the Turkish army. He had, moreover, definitely issued orders for the column to march to Shaikh Saad, and had explained to his subordinate leaders his intention of driving the enemy's right into the loop at Shaikh Saad and holding it there until defeated. As this was to be the decisive movement it would probably have been well therefore, to have incurred a larger hazard on his right; and it is ..suggested that he might have reduced materially the force which was to operate on the left bank in order to make more certain of achieving his purpose against the Turkish troops that were standing in front of Shaikh Saad. It was necessary to have troops on both banks so as to prevent the enemy from attacking the British shipping. There was a good deal of firing into Younghusband's camp on the night of the 5-6th January, and on the morning of the 6th a dense fog came on which for some time prevented movement. The Cavalry Brigade had, however, ridden out at 0830, and not long afterwards the 28th Brigade group also marched off covered by an advanced guard consisting of one troop of the 16th Cavalry, one section of Field Artillery, the 56th Rifles and one company of the 128th Pioneers. The main body of the group was formed m two parallel columns, one moving along a track, the other being on its left. The first of these columns comprised the 9th Brigade, R. F. A. (less one section) the 92nd Punjabis, who were sent across the river in the Blosse Lynch during the morning, one com pany of the 128th Pioneers, three sections of Field Ambulances and ail the wheeled first line transport. The outer column was composed ot half of the 13th Sappers and Miners, the machine guns of the 28th Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Leicestershires, the 53rd Sikhs, and the 51st Sikhs less two companies which were with the second line transport. On the left bank the 35th Brigade group had also moved forward at 0830 under the protection of an advanced guard composed of one troop of the 16th Cavalry, the 37th Dogras and two companies of the 102nd, while the remainder of the 16th Cavalry secured the outer flank of101 the column. For some time the advance was uneventful, but at 1000 the mist cleared away, and an hour later reports came in of the presence of .the enemy. Soon afterwards the leading companies of infantry sent word that trenches had been located about half a mile to their front and running northwards from the river. Deployment now took place, the leading unite were reinforced, and the 1-lst Sussex 15-pounder Battery unlimbered and fired a few rounds at two regiments of hostile cavalry which had appeared on the right They proved, however, to be out of range, and were contained for the remainder of the day by the 16th Cavalry. No sooner had the attack •of the infantry been launched than the troops found themselves under a heavy and accurate fire of shrapnel which caused considerable loss Owing to the mirage, and to the fact that the whole area was covered with the low banks of disused irrigation channels and also by patches of scrub, it was almost impossible exactly to locate the Turkish defences which were well sited. Nevertheless when the 102nd had come up on the right of the 37th, and the 97th had moved up to their support some progress was made ; for the Mst Sussex Battery was also now in acti-.n within 2,500 yards of the enemy's position, the 77th Howit/er Batterv had opened fire on its left, and the 72nd had unlimbered some 300 vards from the right of the Sussex guns. The infantry however, were defi nitely checked when, as they supposed, from 700 to 800 vards from t-.lio Turkish lines. e The advance along the right bank had, meanwhile, been carried on without incident for about 4 miles until the mist lifted; an d now the Cavalry Brigade, which was moving over ground much intersected bv dry watercourses found itself in the presence of a number of Arabs who were driven off by our machine guns. At about the same tim; the advanced guard of the 28th Infantry Brigade group reported t}J !£ enemy's entrenchments had been observed by the scouts at a distance •of two miles ahead and that a mass of 1,000 mounted men could be Ts tinguished some three miles away to the front in the mirage On mg the western end of the Mandaliya reach half an hour later tif.T vanced guard halted, and the artillery fired a few rounds ie ma tl parties of the enemy; and now the guns with the Cavalry Brigade a£o ■opened fire at a range of 3,000 yards, and word was sent back that 500 ■enemy horsemen were manoeuvring round their left Since tW 7 might attempt to raid our shipping, the Cranefly, whth w^ foiW 1 ' 8 Gadfly, was sent downstream to act as escort to the river ''f As soon as the main body of the 28th Brigade eroun W1 amerS ' General KemMl took me.s.ren m a coorimee'vith k geMraUeTop' f .h K izrz:' £ £sfj irsrr navigation, impeded by sand pits and shallow stretohef * of the ban H102 his instructions. The advanced guard was ordered to move lorward, to- keep its right on the bank of the Tigris, to engage the enemy and to push, home the attack as soon as the operation of the remainder had developed.. The rest of the Brigade group was to advance against enemy's position: as previously located by the airmen, the troops marching in echelon from, the right, the 53rd in the front, then the Leicesters ? next the two com panies of the 51st and finally the 92nd and half of the 13th Sappers and^ Miners. The artillery were to be on the inner flank escorted by one com pany of the 128th. The Cavalry Brigade was to secure the left of the- Infantry, and was also to envelop the enemy's line and prevent the escape of his troops in a southwesterly direction out of the loop of the river. General Kemball's troops were met as they advanced with botlk shell fire and heavy musketry, directed apparently on localities of which the ranges had previously been ascertained. As the attack made pro gress it became evident that the Turkish trenches extended a good deal; further than had been reported, and both the Leicesters and 51st were obliged at 1300 to incline outwards so as to face the enemy's fire. The envelopment of the Turkish flank and an attack on their troops from two directions would, it was therefore apparent, be more difficult than hadi previously been supposed. Soon afterwards the Cavalry Brigade, which was now nearly due south of and some four miles from Shaikh Saad, reported the presence of another series of trenches one and a half miles further from the river, and that an attempt would be made to outflank these. But a body oi Turkish camelmen, which had issued from Shaikh Saad somewhat earlier, now prevented this manoeuvre by endeavouring to work round our left in conjunction with the Arabs, although both fell back whenever the Horse Artillery opened fire on them. In the end the commander of the Cavalry Brigade disposed the bulk of his men so as to contain the enemy's- horsemen. He then directed one squadron of the 4:th Cavalry to dis mount and endeavour exactly to locate the enemy's trenches with the support of S. Battery which opened fire on them at a range of 2,000 yards.. Subsequently the Brigade again attempted to advance westwards, but being met by rifle fire from entrenchments and menaced on its left by the enemy's camelmen and hoisemen, returned to its original position where it was rejoined by the squadron that had dismounted. At 1500 the positions of the troops of the 28th Brigade group were as follows : the artillery were in action not far from the river, the 20th Battery supporting the 53rd and the 28th assisting the Leicestershire. Owing to the fact that the 53rd had moved in a southwesterly direction, a gap had appeared between them and the 56th Eifles who were on the right; the 51st were in line with the left of the 53rd and from 300 to 500 yards from the enemy's position; then came the Leicestershire, whose103 tiring line was within 500 yards ot tne Turkish trenches but their left was quite two miles from the Tigris. General Kemball had only the 92rid and half of the 13th Sappers and Miners in hand, and these he was holding under cover in a watercourse 1,000 yards to the west of the bend of tte Tigris at Hibsh. At about 1545 * Kemball had resolved to make a further attempt to outflank the enemy, and had directed the 92nd to move to the left of the line. Soon afterwards a message was received from Younghusband that the action was to be discontinued, that battle outposts were to be placed in position, and that the ships, which had been held back all day by the Turkish shells, but owing to the slackening of the enemy's gun fire, had at last been able to move forward, were to be closed under the steep banks of the Tigris. General Kemball had also received a report from the Cavalry Brigade that there were still numbers of the enemy's horsemen on their left, but that it seemed as if the Turkish Infantry were moving westwards. Before complying with Younghusband's orders Kemball, therefore personally went forward to take stock of the situation ; but, finding himself under heavy musketry from both front and flank, he came to the conclusion that there was no immediate prospect of victory. Orders were then issued to the troops to entrench where they stood, and aftei darkness had fallen, arrangements were to be made to send back the wounded, and also parties of men for the purpose of obtaining water and rations. The 92nd, who had moved forward, were to return to the watercourse at once, the half of the 13th Sappers and Miners were to build a redoubt near its southern extremity, and as soon as it was dark all the artillery were to withdraw to Hibsh and remain there under escort of one com pany of the 92nd and one company of the 128th Pioneers. In notifying these arrangements to the headquarters of the first echelon Kemball however, gave it as his opinion that the enemy would probably fall back during the night. Meanwhile General Rice had not pressed his attack, and had kept the 97th and l-5th Buffs in hand. After nightfall the positions that had been reached were consolidated, arrangements were made to bring food, water and ammunition to the infantry ; and the Gunners, after con structing gun pits, withdrew to a bivouac at the western end of the Musandaq reach, where the transport had been parked and the bulk of the 19th Infantry Brigade had remained in reserve. The enemy had not attempted directly to attack the shipping during the day, but the Turks sent several floating mines down river some of which were sunk by fire, and none occasioned loss or damage. One mine was also seen in the water when the head of General Aylmer's second * The sun set at about 17] 5. H104 ectelon gained the eastern end of the Musandaq reach at 1700, but fortunately it did not explode. 0winn to a breakdown in the Signal service, which as has been stated, wus to a large extent improvised, Sir Fenton Aylmer did not receive any reports from General Younghusband during the action, and it was not until 2100 that the following message came to hand : ' As arranged advanced on both banks this morning after two hours delay by fog, found enemy in strength holding trenches as reported by aeroplane. Attacked on right bank, holding on left bank. Owing to short time available and inability of weak Cavalry Brigade to drive off large bodies of Turkish and Arab Cavalry my left was held up and unable to turn ike enemy's right. Situation now as follows on right bank, 28th Brigade with 92nd and 9th Artillery Brigade attacking enemy's entrenchments ; cavalry withdrawn to river bank in rear. On left bank 35th Brigade, with Heavy Artillery Brigade facing entrenchments, 19th Brigade, less 92nd, in rear. Will continue battle at daybreak, would suggest 7th Lancers, Mountain and Howitzer Batteries and one infantry brigade reinforcing my left, other brigade on left bank. Am throwing bridge during night at junction of nullah, half mile east of Hibsh bend. Casual ties not yet ascertained.' Somewhat later a reply to this message was sent from the Head quarters of the Tigris Corps stating that the troops of the second echelon would march at 0800 to the bridge ; that the 7th Lancers, less one troop, would start at 0700 (that is at about the time the sun rose), to rejoin the Cavalry Brigade ; that General Younghusband was to meet the Corps Commander on the left bank at the bridge at 0730 , and that the first echelon was not to undertake a serious attack until after he had arrived on the field. A full report as to the enemy's dispositions was also required. Earlier in the evening Younghusband had approved of a proposal to transfer the 56th Rifles from the right to the left of the 28th Infantry Brigade and that this battalion and the 92nd should then attack the enemy. But, at midnight, Kemball sent word that reports from the firing line showed that the situation was somewhat different from what it had appeared to be in the afternoon. The enemy were in strongly built trenches, seemed to have ample ammunition and showed no signs wavering, rather the reverse. The night was so dark that it had not been possible to communicate with the 56th; the idea of transferring this battalion from one flank to the other had, therefore, been abandoned, and units had been ordered to entrench where they stood. The artillery positions would be entrenched on the 7th, and Kemball would then rely on the guns and Cavalry Brigade to prevent the Turks from turning the left of the 28th Brigade. There was urgent need of more ammunition.105 The Turks kept up a vigorous fire on Kemball's troops throughout ithe night of the 6-7th January, and, as a heavy thunderstorm also broke •over the battlefield, the entrenchments were not excavated without a good deal of difficulty. However, during the night the ammunition was -replenished ; and, at 0645 on the 7th, the Cavalry Brigade rode out rto a position about one and a half miles to the south of their bivouacs, whence they could cover the left of Kemball's troops and also secure rthe safety of the transport of the group. It appears that Kemball's latest report was not transmitted to the Headquarters of the Tigris Corps; but, at about 0130, a message was received from Younghusband to the effect that the Turks were Tn rforce on both banks of the Tigris, and that it was not possible to give au ■exact estimate of their strength* Eight guns hadbjenlocated, and a .number of infantry had been seen to move out of Shaikh Saad at dusk. There were 2,000 Turkish cavalry and 1,500 Arabs on the right bank ^of the river. Meanwhile General Aylmer had issued orders for the advance of the •second echelon at 0830 ou the 7th. The 9th Infantry Brigade consist ing of the l-4th Hampshires, 107th Pioneers, was, with one section of the -.23rd Mountain Battery, to march up the right bank of the Tigris under Brigadier G -eneral R. St. J. Harvey ; at the same time Brigadier General V.E. de M. None was to advance up the left bank with a group comprising the 21st Infantry Brigade, which consisted of the 2nd Black Watch, the- '6th Jat Light Infantry, the 9th Bhopal Infantry and the 41st Dogras,; •one section of the 23rd Mountain Battery, and the 61st six gun 4-5 inch Howitzer Battery, which was expected to arrive from Basra but did not take part in the battle. The 7th Lancers (less one troop), one squadron and the machine gun section of which were on the right and the other squadron fon the left bank, were to rejoin the Cavalry Brigade. 'Certain mahailas carrying supplies were to be guarded by a Provisional Battalion, and the gunboats, Butterfly and Dragonfly, were to escort the river steamers and tugs Medjidieh, Molamir, P. 7., Skrin and T. 3. At 0S30 on the 7th Younghusband reported that, owing to the ram, the bridge would not be ready until 1000 and three quarters ■of an hour later he met General Aylmer as arranged, and the latter then •took over the command of the whole force. rp. * p' r ' ng . th e mo . rn i n g of the 6th a report had been made to the headquarters of the About 1 800 merhad be^n there ^ ere 'o large enemy forces in the Sinn positions. Hanna lOOO^en wl^ n on t he 'gW bank of the Tigns to the South of 'Shaikh Saad thmp nnvement on the left bank at Naasa, and on this bank at Ck at Shaikh P ol ding 2,000 men. There was also a camp on the right havinfsix ^ iTtvn 0f trenche l' the first one aild a half ^ long ^nd ■be in th« sefond l t Th- were , 3es ' 1 left bank and troops were observed to vthe river on the risht * 1° trencheS exteadin g ^ one and a half miles from e right bank, but neither gun pits nor troops were seen here. T One squadron was in Kut-al-Amara.106 The situation as explained by Sir George Younghusband disclosed to^ Sir Fenton Aylmer the fact that liis subordinate bad been deeply com mitted to battle, and that only part of the 19tb Infantry Brigade and tbe Cavalry Brigade were still in band. As regards tbe enemy, tbe inform ation tbat bad been received before tbe commencement of tbe action, combined witb a report from an airman on tbe 6tb, indicated tbat com paratively small numbers of Turks were on tbe rigbt bank of tbe Tigris,, altbougb tbe position of tbe wbole of tbe enemy's entrenchments bere- bad not been definitely located. General Aylmer would soon be able to use tne bridge tbat was being constructed for tbe purpose of trans ferring troops from one side of tbe river to tbe otber ; and altbougb tbe^ bridge was witbin range of tbe Turkish artillery, which might interrupt or delay the passage of troops, he held, therefore, a great advantage over the enemy who did not possess the means of passing troops quickly across the Tigris.* Frobably the first requisite for the British was more information, f but, in the circumstances as they may then have appeared to General Aylmer, two alternatives, broadly speaking, were open to him. He could concentrate against the enemy's force on the right bank of the Tigris, which was comparatively weak or he could hold these troops to their trenches and make his principal effort against the larger numbers that' were on the left bank. There is much to be said in favour of and against either course. If the British massed their men on the right bank of the- Tigris a successful offensive against the Turkish detachment was prac- iically assured, and the British might, in consequence, be able to render the inner lines of entrenchments on the left bank of the river untenable by the enemy's troops. This, however, was by no means certain unless&gt; the fire from the right bank could be directed and controlled from the- left; for the ground was so fiat that even the small dykes that existed in localities where the Arabs had endeavoured to control the flood water would defilade the enemy's lines. Further, such success as might be- gained on the right bank would be over a small portion of tbe enemy V forces only, and the main body of Turkish army might, in the meanwhile, outflank the British forces that were retained on the left bank of the- Tigris : and if they gained the bank of the river, might, as had happened ub Umm-al-Tumal, during Townshend's retreat to Kut-al-Amara, then- destroy the shipping on which the British depended for their existence. The concentration of British troops on the left bank of the Tigris- would largely obviate this danger, and to the cavalry, with the whole- * They would have to be transported on rafts or in small boats, f From an intercepted enemy order it appeared that we were being opposed by the 35th, 38th and 51st Divisions. According to reports of Arabs the Turkish Cavalry- Brigade was on the right bank, and our cavalry had been engaged with camelmen ana. two battalions infantry.107 &lt;or even part of an Infantry Brigade and a few guns, the task of prevent ing the Turkish detachment which was on the right bank from interfering with the land or river transport could safely be left. Further, a decisive victory on the left bank would settle once and for all the question of the relief of Kut-al-Amara, and Townshend would be able to harass ef ectively the enemy's beaten troops as they emerged from the defile between the Suwaikiya marsh and the Tigris. Against this alternative there was, however, the fact that, as part of Aylmer's force was closely engaged on the left bank, the rest could not manoeuvre freely, even within the limits prescribed by the waterless area and lack of transport, without exposing it to defeat in detail. The British, therefore, would perhaps be obliged directly to attack a numerous enemy holdng, a strongly entrenched position ; and, if so, must fight under conditions when casualties could, not fail to be serious and decisive success would be unlikely. No one arguing after the event can fairly decide which of the alternatives would have been most advantageous, unless he possesses an intimate acquaint ance with all the factors involved, including the quality and morale of the respective forces, for this is and must always be decisive. It may, how ever, be observed that a rapid success gained on the right bank would probably have put a stop to any Turkish attempts to deliver a counter attack ; but, if the attainment of such success were unlikely, then it would be best to make the greater effort on the left bank of the river, and this is the plan which was adopted by General Aylmer. Between 0900 and 1000 on the 7th, while Aylmer was considering these factors, both the 35th Brigade and the 16th Cavalry who had ^gain ridden northwards and were watching a body of the enemy's cavalry, reported that a Turkish force of a couple of battalions and four squadrons was moving round the British right. The 1- 1st Sussex Battery had pre viously been firing on the enemy's trenches that were in front of the 35tli Brigade, after ranging over yellow screens displayed so as to mark the positions of our infantry, and also on the enemy's reserves ; but it now turned on the Turkish cavalry obliging them to retire^ and the infantry battalions disappeared. It seems possible that this demonstration caused General Aylmer to decide at once to prosecute the offensive, although the enemy's disposi tions had as yet not definitely been ascertained on either bank of the river; and, at 1015 orders were issued from the Headquarters of the Tigris Corps that another attack was to be made on the Turkish positions astride the Tigris. The following troops, viz., the 19th Infantry Brigade (less the 92nd Punjabis) the 21st Infantry Brigade, the 35th In fantry Brigade, the 9th Field Artillery Brigade (less the 28th Battery), the 1-lst Sussex Battery, the 16th Cavalry and two companies of the 128th Pioneers, were placed under General Younghusband for this pur pose. He was also informed that the 19th and 21st Brigades were to be108 employed in turning the enemy's left flank, in conjunction with a frontal attack which was to be made on the trenches that stood on and near the- left bank of the Tigris. At the same time General Kemball was to take^ command of the 28th Infantry Brigade, 92nd Punjabis, one company of: the i28th Pioneers, the 28th Field Battery, and two sections of the 23rd Mountain Battery and, as soon as General Younghusband's troops were- in position for the delivery of the turning attack, Kemball's force was to- make a vigorous advance in co-operation with the Cavalry Brigade. The 9th Infantry Brigade and the Provisional Battalion would be in reserve- on the right bank; and the 62nd Punjabis, who had just come up, the 72nd and 77th Heavy Batteries, one section of the 104th Heavy Battery and the 13th Sappers and Miners would be under the orders of the Corps Commander on the left bank. Eeports were to be sent to the northern end of the bridge. On receipt of these instructions General Younghusband sent for his^ brigadiers and artillery commanders to whom the plan of action was- explained at 1100. It was proposed that the attack should commence at noon, when the 19th Infantry Brigade (less the 92nd, and also two- companies of the 28th which had been sent to the 35th Infantry Brigade), was to advance on the right of the 35th Infantry Brigade, and sweeping, round was to roll up the enemy's left flank in co-operation with the 16th« Cavalry working on the right. As progress was made by the 19th Brigade, the 35th would co-operate by delivering an attack during which its left was to rest on the bank of the Tigris. The artillery would support both attacks from positions about a mile to the noith-west of the bridge, and the 21st Infantry Brigade would follow behind the centre of the group as the reserve. The dispositions that had been indicated by General Younghusband may have been those best adapted to the situation, for, as has been pointed out, it does not appear that the positions of the enemy's trenches had been accurately located owing to the prevalence of haze and mirage and other causes; and the fact of coming under fire, and the direction from which the fire was delivered, were generally the first indications of the presence of the Turks.- But the arrangements were hardly in accordance- with either the letter or spirit of the orders that had been issued by Gene ral Aylmer. It was indeed afterwards found that the Turkish front line extended for more than three miles from the Tigris, and that this line- was connected with other entrenchments, which had been constructed for the use of supports and reserves, by a number of well made commu nication trenches. A series of trenches thrown forward at some distance from the left of the first line so as to flank it had also been commenced ; and, in addition, a third position had been prepared from three to five- miles behind the Turkish left, where resistance could be offered to any- British attempts at envelopment.109 Owing to delay in passing over the bridge it was found that the 19th and 20th Batteries would not be available at noon for the support of Younghusband's attack. Genera] Aylmer, however, placed the 72nd Howitzer Battery at his disposal, and sent instructions that the attack was to proceed. Accordingly, at about 1145 the 19th Brigade advanced in a north westerly direction in two lines of columns with a distance of 500 yards between the lines. On the left were the 2nd Sea- forth Highlanders, on the right the 125th, less one company which formed the Brigade reserve. Then came one company of the 28th, the other was escorting transport, and the machine guns of the Brigade moved on the right of the second line. The 16th Cavalry were on the right of the 10th Infantry Brigade, but a section of this regiment was also detailed co guide the Seaforths on to the right flank of the 35th Brigade. The units of the 19th Brigade did not at first meet with any opposi tion, but between 1330 and 1400 an officer of the improvised staff of the 7th Division rode up from Younghusband's Headquarters and pointed out that the Brigade had moved too far to the north, and that, in consequence, there was now a gap between the 19th and 35th Brigades.. This must be filled up by the 21st Infantry Brigade, which, after advancing for some distance, had halted, at 1320 so as to enable the 19th Brigade to move into position, and was about to cook dinners. The staff officer then gave instructions that the 19th Brigade was to tuin to the left, march forward for about 1,C00 yards and then, after: wheeling to its left, deliver an attack. The troops, therefore, proceeded in the new direction, and soon afterwards a body of Turks, who were engaged in excavating trenches, came suddenly in sight out of the haze on the right of the British and net more than from 1,200 to 1,500 yards away. Mean while orders had boen issued to the Black Watch and 6th Jats of the 21st Brigade to fill in the interval between the 19th and 35th Brigades, and these units had moved rapidly forward in artillery formation &lt;;o do so. The Turks did not at once open fire, and some of the units of the 19th Infantry Brigade were given time in which to adopt extended order but the leading companies, as well as those of the Black Watch and 6th Jats, then found themselves under heavy musketry from two sides, and also under shell fire from their right rear. As was only natural the British now faced in both directions, and further endeavoured, although without the assistance of gun fire, to close with and evict the enemy by means of a rapid advance. The supports were soon absorbed in the fight, but the efforts of the troops were unavailing; and, at about 15C0 after suffering very serious losses, a body of men consisting of about half of the Seaforths and half of the 125th, who had rushed foiward right into the eye of the sun, was brought to a stand still 250 yards from the left flank of the main Turkish position, their own left being in touch110 with the two companies of the 128th Pioneers. These had followed the Black Watch and 6th Jats, who, after experiencing heavy casualties, had been checked at a distance of between 300 and 400 yards from the enemy. Half a mile away on the right another group of Seaforths, 125th and 28th was facing northwards and was about 300 yards from the enemy's flanking trenches. The men now began to make such cover as could be thrown up with their entrenching implements ; but soon after wards a force of Turks, probably the battalions which had been seen in the morning by the 35th Brigade and 16th Cavalry, accompanied by Arab horsemen, began to advance as if to envelop our right, which was being guarded by the 16th Cavalry. Colonel Dennys then put in his small reserve and the machine guns, and sent to the 21st Infantry Brigade for assistance. General Norie at once moved the 41st up behind the right of the 19th Brigade, and subsequently prolonged the line with the 9th Bhopals. With the assistance of the 77th Howitzer Battery which had been brought in action to support the left of the 21st Infantry Brigade, and of the 19th and 20th Field Batteries and 72nd Howitzer Battery which were now covering the 19th Brigade, the advance of the Turkish Infantry was then checked at a distance of some 400 to 600 yards from our front, and the rest of the Turks were held to their trenches. At the same time the two guns of the 104th Heavy Battery, which were firing from a position near the bank of the Tigris, and the fire of the big gun of the Cranefly which sent a few rounds tow T ards them, put an end to the advance of the Arab horsemen. The presence of large numbers on and behind the enemy's left had also been reported at about 1500 by an airman. This officer had seen three battalions in the open on the Turkish left flank, a body of from 3,000 to 4,000 men was in occupation of a newly excavated trench lying at some distance, four or five miles, behind the left, and there were also from 2,000 to 4,000 Arabs in this area. The Turks, however, did not again attempt to make an attack, and as the British were unable to do so the battle then remained stationary in this quarter until dusk, when the 19th Brigade, which now had in line only 800 rifles, was able to re organise and entrench on a frontage of about 1,200 yards facing both west and north. The Black Watch and 6th Jats also dug in after withdrawing for a short distance; and the remainder of the 21st Brigade, which had not been so roughly handled, secured the position that they were holding, while ammunition was replenished, food and water were sent up to the units and the wounded were collected and brought in. During the time when this action had been ia prog ess the 1-lst Sussex Battery had been firing at the supposed position of the portions of the enemy's trenches that lay nearer the Tigris ; but these subsequently were found to be further from the leading troops of the 35th Brigade thanIll 9iad been believed so that the fire was not effective. At about ]500 however, the infantry of this Brigade pushed forward, 97th being on the left then came the l-5th Buffs, and the 37th Dogras formed the right; the 102nd and two companies of the 28th were held in reserve. About 400 yards were gained, but the attack then came to a standstill under a very violent fire of rifles and machine guns ; and although the two com panies of the 28th were put into the fight on the left and the fire of the .'Sussex Battery was directed on to the enemy's trenches, no further ^progress was made. At nightfall the troops of the 35th Brigade drew back for about 100 yards, and then entrenched in spite of the enemy's fire, and at about 2230 the 102nd relieved the Buffs who became the Brigade reserve. It seems that the Turkish gunners, who had kept up a heavy fire all 'day on our artillery, were equally unsuccessful in locating the batteries; and the number of casualties among the personnel was in consequence .small. At 1730 (about 15 minutes after sunset) the whole of the British batteries on the left bank were withdrawn for purposes of security to their bivouacs near the bridge, and this movement was completed without loss. Some compensation for the grave situation which had developed on the left bank of the river had fortunately been found in a success that had ;been gained by the units under Kemball. While making his dispositions for attack, Kemball had carried out a thorough preparation for the ad vance with the guns that were at his disposal. At 1330 when heavy firing was heard on the left bank, all was ready for the attack ; and keeping the 56th near the river, and a reserve consisting of the 92nd, one company of the 51st and the 13th Sappers and Miners, Kembal! now ■ gave orders for the rest to push on. The 53rd, three companies of the 51st and the Leicestershires therefore moved forward from their trenches. The fire of the Turks was, however, so strong and accurate that, not withstanding the bold rushes that were made by the men of the Leices tershire Regiment, the British had not been able to close with the enemy by 1500. At this hour General Kemball directed the 92nd to push for ward on the left of the Leicesters, and at 1530 he committed the rest -of his slender reserve to action on the left of the line. After very heavy fighting and mutual loss, the Turks were unable to resist the pressure of the British and, by 1600, with the close co-operation of the 28th Field Battery which was in action on^y 1,500 yards behind our leading troops, a first line of trenches was captured together with 2 mountain guns, 3 machine guns and between 500 and 600 prisoners. The Turks, however, were not demoralised by this incident and attempts to move forward again were met with so strong a fire from trenches both to the front and flank of our line of advance, that Kemball ordered his men to secure their positions and place battle outposts.112 Meanwhile, after having, in the early morning, taken up positions sa as to protect the transport, the Cavalry Brigade had marched south- westwards for some distance at about 0900. While doing so the units&gt; came under the fire of the enemy's guns, and also observed enemy in fantry and cavalry advancing from Shaikh Saad. During the morning; a few rounds were fired by S. Battery at the Turkish trenches and camel- men ; and, at about 1330 when advancing on the left of KembalFs- force, the cavalry regiments were met by rifle fire from the Turkish posi tion and sustained a few casualties. Subsequently the Brigade rode- further westwards to their old position about four miles to the south of Shaikh Saad, and here they were able to check the advance of certain. of the enemy's reinforcements by means of gun fire. After some further skirmishing with the Arabs, who as usual, hung round our flanks, the- Brigade returned to the bridge at dusk. In view of the reports that had come in as to the situation of the^ 19th and 21st Infantry Brigades, General Aylmer had moved the two battalions of the 9th Infantry Brigade at 1400 across the bridge to the left bank of the Tigris ; and subsequently the Brigade, to which the 62nd were joined, marched northwards for some distance in order to be in. position to prolong the right of the 21st Brigade. Except that a few- shells fell near them, the troops were not actually engaged, and at dusk they returned to the river. It has been pointed out that the airman who- had flown over the field had brought the news of the presence of a mass of from 3,000 to 4,000 Turks at a distance of 4 or 5 miles behind the left of their position. This information, coupled with the efforts that had twice been made by the enemy to outflank the British right, and also a. report that at dusk two bodies of men had been seen moving eastwards from the Turkish left, caused G-eneral Aylmer to take measures to meet, an attempt by the enemy to sever his communications with Shaikh Saad. The l-4th Territorial Battalion Hampshire Regiment, and 62nd Pun jabis, therefore, were sent, at 2130 three miles downstream to en trench a position there, and only the 107th were left as guard to the- transport. At 0430 on the 8th January, however, all three battalions of this Brigade (the 107th had now joined the other) marched, with the 16th Cavalry and 72nd Heavy Battery, for 8 miles further down the bank of the river until within sight of Ali Grharbi, and at daybreak two gun boats also patrolled in this reach. After halting for a couple of hours^ while the Cavalry searched for the Turks, the troops returned to the battlefield. The l-4th Hampshires and the 107th then marched out and I hrew up a line of entrenchments at a distance of about three miles from the Tigris on the right of those of the 19th Infantry Brigade while the Turks fired an occasional shell on our troops.113 The remainder of the units on the left bank had passed the night in. readjusting the line, in digging, in searching for wounded and in escort ing carts which brought food, ammunition and hand grenades from the bivouac and returned there with the wounded. The Turks did nothing except maintain a desultory rifle fire, which at times and especially at midnight and on our right, became violent. Soon after daybreak General Aylmer, who appears to have believed that, besides artillery and mounted troops, there were 7,500 Turkish Infantry on the left a ad 4,500 on the right bank of the Tigris, issued in structions that further attacks were not to be undertaken bv the men %f under Younghusband, until the success of the 28th Brigade had so far been exploited as to enable the Turkish position to be taken in enfilade from the right bank. The day was hot, and, as usual there was a mirage, which acted as a defective magnifying glass in both distorting, and enlarging objects and movements. In the reconoaissance that was carried out by the airmen in the morning, three groups aggregating 6,000 Turks were seen to be standing behind the lines of the enemy^ entrenchments and to the north west of Shaikh Saad, and 3,000 men. were noticed in the bend of the river to the west ot this place. The 16th Cavalry had meanwhile again taken up their task of observing, the Turkish horsemen on the left bank, and most conflicting reports were received during the morniDg from these and other troops as to the move ments of the enemy, who were said to be retiring, to be moving in force round our right, and not to be visible at all on our right. The two guns of the 104th Battery, the 77th Pleavy Battery, the 1-lst Sussex and the 20th Field Batteries had also moved again in the morning into position. from which to support the troops on the left bank, but there was little gun fire during the day on either side. At about 1500 an attack by a. couple of battalions and a force of cavalry seemed about to develop against the 21st Infantry Brigade. The attempt, however, was not made ; and except for some effective shelling of the enemy at 1630 when the mirage had cleared away, by the 72nd Battery, which was supporting the 19th Brigade, and a good deal of shooting by Turkish marksmen, who continually harassed our troops, there was no other fighting on the left bank of the Tigris. In order to assist General Kemball in prosecuting his attack the- 62nd Punjabis and the 19th Field Battery were sent to the right back, and the Cavalry Brigade received instructions to work under his orders. During the morning Kemball again carried out a methodical fire pre paration with the 19th and 28th Field Batteries and the four guns of the 23rd Mountain Battery, and these were also seconded by the guns of the war vessels. Soon aftei 0800 it seemed as if the Turks were falling back. The Cavalry Brigade, therefore; were brought up along the right bank of the Tigris behind the line that was held hy the infantry, but the horftt-114 &lt;men were received with, so violent a fire of shrapnel as to show tliat the hopes that had been entertained of the enemy's retirement were pre mature. To make assurance doubly sure one squadron of the 14th Hussars was, however, sent forward, but this was soon driven back by rifle fire from both banks of tie river ; and meanwhile Kemball bad despatched t'le remainder of the Cavalry Brigade to its former position, 4 miles to the south of Shaikh Saad, so as to secure the left flank of his Infantry. This locality was reached shortly before 1000 and leaving the advanced guard in position to secure their left, the Cavalry began, not long afterwards, to move towards some enemy trenches that had been located 3,000 yards away and facing to the south-east and east. Although the Horse Artillery engaged these trenches at racges of from 2,300 to - .2,500 yards, the enemy were not shaken, and our horsemen were held back by effective rifle fire. At noon a body of mounted Arabs came forward as if desirous of closing with the advanced guard, but these were driven of! by the fire of our guns and machine guns. Later on a Turkish reinforcement was seen to advance from Shaikh Saad, but this was out of range. The Cavalry, therefore, could do nothing more than remain in position until 1430, and they then withdrew followed, as usual, by the Arabs. At about 1100 General Kemball again reported that the Turks showed signs of weakening, and that he proposed to thrust forward the 62nd who had now come up, and also to carry out a personal recon naissance. The 62nd accordingly moved past the 56th and advanced along the bank of the Tigris to within about 500 yards of what seemed to be the enemy's forward trenches. But behind these there was apparently another formidable position which seemed also to be held in strength. After having completed his reconnaissance Kemball reported that he was still of opinion that the enemy were withdrawing although guns were being moved forward from Shaikh Saad and the British Cavalry had been checked. He added that, after having brought two batteries into position closely to support the Infantry, it was hoped to deliver a success ful attack in the afternoon. On the other hand he pointed out that it had been found to be quite impossible to locate the enemy's position on the left bank of the river. The information contained in this message caused General Aylmer to consider the desirability of modifying his plans. At 1300, therefore, an enquiry was addressed to Kemball as to whether the force at his disposal was sufficiently numerous to capture Shaikh Saad without incurring pro hibitive loss, in view of the nature of the ground and the strength that had been disclosed by the enemy ? He was also asked to give his opinion as to whether it would not be advantageous for the whole force to make a night attack on the Turks as mon as a pkn for this purpose could be115 drawn up. Meanwhile he was to defer the delivery of the attack! An? hour later Kemball reported that to make a night attack would be preferable, as the troops were in need both of food and rest. Although in an aerial reconnaissance which had been made at about 1600 a. distinct movement up stream of Turkish troops had been observed, the total strength of the enemy's forces was still estimated as being 9,500 op the left and 5,500 on the right bank of the Tigris. Aylmer therefore decided to adopt the alternative of a night attack, and : instructions were seut both to Younghusband and Kemball accordingly. At dusk the Artillery on the left bank again withdrew to their bivouacs near the bridge. At 1800 orders were sent to General Younghusband that the 35th Infantry Brigade was to become a reserve and to be placed near the bridge on the left bank of the river ; the 19th and 21st Infantry Brigades were to reorganise, entrench and take over the whole front line- on the left bank, the 21st being on the outer flank ; the 128th Pioneers were to join the main body of the 9th Infantry Brigade, which, as has been stated, was now holding a position some 2 or 3 miles to the north of the Tigris, and were to assist these units to entrench it. While the evacuation of wounded and the despatch of water and 1 rations to the troops were in hand, the Seaforths and 125th of the 19th Brigade fell back at 2000 for about 1,000 yards and entrenched, and the 41st and the 9th Bhopals, of the 21st Brigade, then relieved the- whole of the units of the 19th Brigade. Owing to the proximity of the enemy it was 1300 before the latter Brigade, which was to replace the 35th Brigade, had been concentrated. The night was now very dark and cold, there was a strong wind and rain began to fall. As a result the guides lost their way, the men became exhausted with marching and countermarching through clinging mud ; the relief of the 35th Brigade did not take place during the night, and in the end it was not moved to the bridge until after daybreak on the 9th. The reports of patrols sent out in the early morning of the 9th when, the rain had turned into a drizzle, were to the effect that the Turks were still in position. The mud now rendered all movement slow, the drizzling rain caused observation to be more difficult than ever, but at 1000 the 16th Cavalry reported, from a position 3 miles to the north of Shaikh Saad, that there were no Turks to be seen, and that many of the trenches were certainly unoccupied. Meanwhile the Cavalry Brigade, which had moved out at 0730 as escort to a couple of staff officers who were to reconnoitre the ground to be passed over during the night attack, found that the Turkish trenches on the right bank were empty. A few wounded men were seen limping painfully away from Shaikh Saad, and, on the left bank, many cavalry were observed to be marching westwards. , Feeling their way cautiously forwards the Cavalry Brigade gained a position at noon about 3 miles116 to the south of the bend of the Tigris at Shaikh Saad ; and subsequently, under orders from General Aylmer, an advance was made to tht neigh bourhood of Naasa, which was found to be clear of enemy. The reports that had come in up to about 1130 had convinced General Aylmer that the enemy had indeed retired, and had moved apparently to Hanna and the Sannaiyat defile. A request was then made that the gunboats Cranefly, Gadfly and Dragonfly should take up the pursuit; General Kemball was ordered to advance forthwith ; •and General Younghusband was directed to be prepared to move forward and co-operate with General Kemball. At the same time in- -structions were sent that the 9th Infantry Brigade, together with the 77th Heavy Battery and one section of the 104th Heavy Battery, the 128th Pioneers (less one company) and the 13th Sappers and Miners, and some men of the Provisional Battalion were to remain behind, clear the battlefield and protect the ambulances, supply column and shipping. These orders had to some extent been anticipated, and, at about 1430 Kemball had occupied Shaikh Saad without encountering any •opposition, and the 35th and 21st Infantry Brigades were on the left bank opposite to this place. The 19th Infantry Brigade was employed in escorting first and second line transport which left the Musandaq reach at 1400. In spite of a strong wind and of the glue-like mud that had resulted from the rain, and also of numberless trenches and irrigation channels that had to be crossed, the transport had for the most part been brought in by 2200 but the rear guard did not reach camp until about 0200 on the 10th January. On the next day the staff of the 7th Divi sion at last arrived from France, and took over from the improvised staff that had heretofore been working under General Younghusband. The cause of the enemy's retirement from Shaikh Saad is not manifest for the Turks, who fought more stubbornly than had been the case in any of the battles up to that of Ctesiphon, had not had by any means the worst of the action. Possibly, however, reports as to the imminence of bad weather, which would increase the difficulty. that must already have been serious, of maintaining the force at such a distance from its depots above Kut-al-Amara, may have induced the Turks to abandon Shaikh Saad. On the other hand the 4,000 casualties that had been suffered by the 18,500 or 19,000 British fighting men that were present in this battle were a most serious loss, having regard to the limiting factor of the time that was believed to be available for the fulfilment of General Aylmer's task of relieving Kut-al-Amara. Fur ther, lack of medical personnel and equipment, and of river transport, Ihad involved, as was pointed out by General Aylmer in a message which he addressed to General Headquarters, considerable hardship to the wounded and also grave difficulties in evacuating them ; and117 this, again, could not fail to react unfavourably on the morale of the men. Battle is perhaps the most severe test of human capacity, and since human beings are very liable to error even in the most favourable circum stances, it would be strange indeed if mistakes did not occur in the turmoil of a great contest. Many things contributed to increase the difficulties of the British in this action, and among these were the peculiar local 'Conditions existing in Mesopotamia, the general absence of water at £»ny distance from the Tigris, the flat, open and featureless ground, thp pre sence of disused irrigation channels which rendered the concealment of trenches easy ; the patches of scrub, the constant haze that caused even near objects to be dimly distingunliable and the misleading effects oi the mirage on the appearance of persons, animals and material. But greater even than these were the troubles arising from lack of proper equipment for the service of intercommunication, and also of transport for the relieving force, and from the absence of cohesion among its components. Orders and instructions are always liable to misinterpretation, since ^ speech and writing are but imperfect methods of conveying wishes and intentions. When commanders and subordinates are well known to one .another this disability is modified by the intimate acquaintance that is naturally possessed of characteristics and of methods of thought and procedure. Otherwise such errors as those that took place in the battle of Shaikh Saad can hardly fail to occur. Even allowing for the unusual difficulties of the situation, and for the weaknesses inevitable in an im provised organisation, it does, however, seem that these very deficiencies : should have caused more circumspection to have been displayed in the . operations, and that the heavy casualties might to some extent have been avoided. Perhaps too much reliance was placed on the reports of airmen, who also were working under novel and very difficult conditions, and too little allowance was made for the enemy's power of rapid en trenchment in an easy soil. Whatever may have been the reason, the British leaders on both banks of the Tigris found themselves faced by trenoues of whose existence they were not fully aware, and on the left t bank the troops were outflanked instead of outflanking. \CHAPTER X. The battle of Wadi, 13th January 1916. Hij Major-General Sir W. D. Bird K.B .E., C .B., C.M.G., D.S.O. (This nairative is a sequel to the account of the tattle of Shaikh Paad. It is based on the War Diaries, to which I ^as most kindly permitted to have access. I was also- able to consult ' My Campaign in Mesopotamia,' by Major-General Sir Chailes Town- shend.) During the battle of Shaikh Saad (6th—9th January 1916), a not- inconsiderable telegraphic correspondence had been carried on' between Generals Nixon, Aylmer and Townshend ; and on the 10th January, Townshend, who meanwhile had received news of the enemy's withdrawal from Shaikh Saad, sent a message to Aylmer from Kut-al-Amara to the effect that, in his opinion, the enemy had moved down-river in order- to cover the arrival of reinforcements from the north. It was rumoured, he continued, that an additional Turkish division was due to arrive- at the front on the 20th January, and it was a fact that all the latest arrivals had come up before the dates on which they were expected by our service of intelligence. The telegram was concluded with the words,. ' I think our troubles quite sufficient without more Turks on our backs.' The general situation at this date (10th January) was, from the British point of view, as follows. The information at the disposal of the staff of General Aylmer led them to the conclusion that the Turkish army in Mesopotamia comprised the 13th and 18th Corps, under the command of Nur-ud-din Pasha. The 13th Corps consisted of the 35th Division, which was composed of an amalgamation of the 35th and 38th Arab Divisions, officered by Turks, and the 52nd, an Anatolian Division, commanded by Ali Najib Bey ; the 18th Corps was made up of the 45th, a Turko-Arab Division, and the 51st, an Anatolian Division, and this corps was under Khalil Pasha. It was also reported that four divisions were on the way from Aleppo to Mesopotamia, one of which was expected in a fortnight. In addition it was possible that the 36th Division had moved to Khaniqin for the purpose of opposing the Russian troops who were advancing on Baghdad through Persia^ and there were rumours that another army corps was destined to under take the invasion of Persia by the difficult route leading eastwards from Rowanduz. In the area extending from Baghdad to Khaniqin and thence southwards of Baghdad the Turks could perhaps dispose of about 30,000 to 34,000 fighting men with 60 guns and apparently 4 aeroplanes; but in a month this force might amount to 60,000. On ( US )119 the other hand it was in favour of the British that the balance of victory had, so far, inclined against the Turks, whose morale should therefore be lower than that of our men. The Russians had sent a force of about 15,000, half of whom were mounted, with 46 guns, from the Caucasus into Persia with the object of co-operating with the British against the Turks, and these troops were advancing in several columns on Kermanshah, Teheran, Isfahan and Kazvin, but the roads were in a bad state, and even Kermanshah was 220 miles from Baghdad, the others being twice this distance from it. Sir John Nixon had, however, established direct communication by wireless through Kazvin with the General Headquarters oi rhe Army of the Caucasus, so that more effective measures than heretofore could now perhaps be taken to secure co-operation between two armies. On the British side General Aylmer, who was commanding the force which was advancing up the Tigris with the object of effecting the relief of the garrison of Kut-al-Amara, could dispose only of about 10,000 rifles, 1,500 sabres, and 46 guns, on land, including the 61st Howitzer Battery, which had now reached the front, and the troops that had been left behind to clear the battle-field of Shaikh Saad, and one aero plane fit to fly. In addition the men had fought in a doubtful battle under conditions which were novel to the large majority of them. Five battalions were on the way up the Tigris by steamer to join him, five more were at Basra or on the march up the river, and two battalions as well as 42 guns and a regiment of Indian cavalry were on the voyage to Basra. General Townshend could still muster 8,500 fighting men, but, owing to the tactical disadvantages of the position at Kut-al-Amara, it was probable that a smaller and not a larger number than the garrison would be required to invest the place. For the moment, then, the numbers actually available for the attack, defence or relief of Kut-al-Amara were, it appeared, almost equal. But unless the Russians could quickly prosecute their advance through Persia, and the winter season, bad roads, and mountainous country were all against this, the balance would soon definitely incline in favour of the Turks. Further, it was understood that rations for the garrison of Kut-al-Amara were available only until the end of January ; and the rain storms which occur at this season of the year, and render move ment over the plain very difficult by converting it into a slough of sticky clinging mud, were imminent. Even if Townshend could hold out so long, the floods caused in the rivers by the melting of the snows in the highlands of Armenia and Persia, would, in March at latest, make it impossible for troops to advance from Basra up the route leading along the bank of the Tigris. In the flood season movement near the river would, moreover, even in favourable localities, probably be cur tailed both in the neighbourhood of Kut-al-Amara and above it; and i120 if the dykes controlling the canals above Baghdad were cut, large areas would be inundated, and movement miglit be rendered impracticable in many places. „ , Time, as is usual in war, was therefore again a decisive factor, and the British had again to decide whether to endeavour to gain time by continuing the operations, rather than to await the arrival of reinforce ments. The principal points now for consideration were whether the supplies possessed by the garrison of Kut-al-Amara were sufficient to enable it to hold out if the relief were postponed ; and if so whether it would now be judicious for the British to pause, complete the organi sation of their force, and bring up reinforcements ; the obvious dis advantage of delay being that the enemy would be given the oppor tunity both of strengthening their positions at Hanna and elsewhere, and also of hurrying forward troops with whom either to overwhelm Townshend or to oppose the relieving army. In the article dealing with the battle of Shaikh Saad the opinion has been hazarded that, in principle, the farther that the battles for the possession of Kut-al-Amara were fought from this place, the more advantageous would it be for the British. It is suggested, therefore, that unless reports were received from Townshend that the garrison was in danger of starvation, or that the place was likely to fall to an assault. General Aylmer should have made a pause in his advance and, while gathering reinforcements, should have tried to induce the Turks again to advance to meet him. The British leaders, as will be seen, however, took the opposite view, and they decided that time would best be gained by continuing the operations. On the 11th January, General Aylmer telegraphed at 1300 to Sir John Nixon a full statement in regard to the situation as follows r 44 1 have been forced to remain here to await the 2nd Eajputs and 61st Howitzer Battery, which have just arrived and to evacuate as many sick and wounded as possible in their ships. I advance to-morrow morning to the Umm-al-Hanna bend with General Kemball's (28th) Brigade, one field battery, the 23rd Mountain Battery, and the 33rd Cavalry on the right bank, and the remainder on the left. I have^ established a post here on the right bank with a garrison of one wing of the 2nd Eajputs, a few cavalry, and a gunboat. The sick and wounded who cannot be evacuated before we leave will remain here. After consulting Generals Younghusband (commanding 7th Division) and Kemball, I determined to continue the advance on Kut; but it is my distinct duty to point out that it is a most precarious undertaking, for which T of course accept full responsibility, as I consider that the situa tion demands a supreme effort to relieve Townshend. The Army Commander has full figures of the enemy's strength, and possibly 4,000- may be allowed for his losses and desertions at Shaikh Saad. My fighting121 strength amounts to about 10,000. The enemy is reported by local inhabitants as occupying a position in advance of Es Sinn at the nar rowest part between the Suwada and Suwaikiya marshes. This will probably be continued with an advanced line from near Clery's post to the river. My medical establishments, as you may calculate, are deplorably low and the wounded cannot receive proper attention. Even if it is necessary to remove fighting men from the ships more must be sent up at once. I have only one aeroplane in action. On the other hand I have the greatest confidence that the troops will do what is humanly possible—and I know that the enemy's Arab troops are much demoralised.' That General Aylmer should have warned his superior of the great difficulty of the situation was no more than his duty, and there are few commanders who would not have taken an equally serious view of the situation. Success in war, however, is often gained by the achievement of the apparently impossible when this has become indispensible, and when an opening is given by the enemy without which victory could not have attained. Some such hope may have inspired the reply of General Mxon, who necessarily was not a prey to the anxieties that were oppressing General Aylmer, and was in consequence, likely to adopt a more sanguine outlook. Telegraphing at 1730 from Basra he observed : £&lt; I must leave matter to your decision. Am confident you and fine troops under your command will achieve your object.' 5 Mxon then stated that four battalions would shortly reach the front, and four more could quickly be sent up-river if Aylmer could spare the bulk of the shipping then with his force for their transportation. He added : 44 Meanwhile, however, the enemy will be strengthening his positions. You are as well informed as I am as regards the enemy's possible reinforcements.' As it happened the immediate difficulty was settled not by General Aylmer, but by the Turks ; who, either to gain time, or because of the absence of pursuit, or under political pressure from Constantinople or perhaps because there was a change in the high command (Khalil Pasha having replaced Nur-ud-din), suddenly turned about and began to entrench along the line of the Wadi. General Aylmer was in con sequence able to telegraph at 2200 both to General Headquarters and to Kut-al-Amara that: The Turks have returned and are entrench ing a line on both banks, namely, up the Wadi river and on the right bank of the Tigris opposite. Aeroplane reconnaissance reports their strength as approximately i 1,000, nearly all on the left bank. This probably represent the remains of the 52nd and combined 35th and 38th Divisions (all of which had apparently fought at the battle of Shaikh Saad), and cavalry. I am to-night taking up an entrenched position on the left bank in front of this, as if my intention were to remain i 2here. To-morrow night I shall move well north with one division and cavalry brigade and attack his left flank at dawn, holding him in front with the remainder of my force. This has vastly increased our probabi lity of success—and I hope to give him a good beating. Es Sinn was clear of troops at noon and only 300 seen at Abu Rumman.' Next day information was sent to Nixon that none of the shipping with Aylmer's force could be sent down river so as to facilitate the despatch of rein forcements, for if the British were successful in the coming battle, a rapid advance to Kut-al-Amara would be made with the whole of the vessels. The action of the Turks had certainly afforded to the British a better opportunity of gaining success than would have been the case had they followed what seems to have been their original intention of holding the defile between the Suwaikiya marsh and the Tigris, which is less than a mile across, and where the enemy would have been within more easy reach both of Kut-al-Amara and their bridge at the Shumran bend a few miles above the town. Whereas now there was greater scope for manoeuvre in which the British troops held the advantage over the Turks. The military problem that had been given to General Aylmer was in essence how to bring about a junction between the two British forces, his own and the garrison of Kut-al-Amara, while at the same time keep ing free communication with his base at Basra. This could be effected either by means of manoeuvre combined with fighting, or by the more direct method of defeating the enemy's army. The distance from Shaikh Saad to Kut-al-Amara via Imam-al- Mansur, on the right bank of the Tigris is between 25 and 30 miles, and it was open to General Aylmer to fling scruples to the winds and to march straight to the right bank of the Tigris opposite to Kut. He must then rely on General Townshend to provide rations for the troops, using all the land transport with the Tigris Corps for the carriage of ammunition and water, and trusting that the Turks would be too much concerned for the safety of their own communications as to which orientals are generally somewhat sensitive, to meddle seriously with those of the British. With favourable weather and a well organised force such a venture might have met with success. But, in view of the climatic conditions when, in consequence of heavy rain the troops might at any moment be rendered almost immobile, and of the impro vised transport that alone was available, this alternative may be ruled out. There remained a project similar to that which had been pro posed by General Younghusband at the battle of Shaikh Saad, of gaining a position on the right bank of the Tigris from which to enfilade the Jnner flank of the Turkish lines on the left bank, and then attacking these directly. Or there was the plan which was actually adopted, or123 a variation of it; and in favour of some such design was the fact that the enemy had shown little or no enterprise at the battle of Shaikh Saad, and would probably, therefore, act again in the same passive manner. Aylmer, in consequence, would be fully justified in taking liberties with his opponents. Further, it is generally supposed that the Turks, when outmanoeuvred, do not quickly adjust their minds to the new conditions in which they are placed and if then hard pressed they rarely recover their mental balance. Since the Wadi at the enemy's left flank was however, only about two and a half miles from the Suwaikiya marsh, it is also evident that an important victory was not likely to be gained unless the Turks were first surprised and the operations of the British were then carried out with the utmost vigour. Otherwise the Turks would probably be able at least to gain the Hanna-Sannaiyat defile in safety. General Aylmer doubtless felt that he could not commit his some what raw force to an advance and attack on the night of the 11-12th January, before the Turks had gained time in which to consolidate their position. In accordance with his intention of misleading the enemy he sent orders, therefore, on the evening of 11th to General Kemball, whose troops (the 28th Infantry Brigade, 28th Field Battery, two sections 23rd Mountain Battery and 33rd Cavalry) were still on the right bank of the Tigris at Shaikh Saad to carry out a feint on the 12th January. Under these orders two battalions, a battery and a squadron were to be despatched up stream on the 12th, and were then ostentatiously to entrench themselves opposite to Naasa. The rest of the group were to remain in camp, and the whole would be required to cross to the left bank of the river on the 12th by the bridge which had been made by the Bridging Train close to Shaikh Saad. Orders were also forwarded to General Younghusband in which he was informed that the Turks were holding the line of the Wadi in strength, and the force would therefore occupy forthwith a position in readiness, preparatory to further operations which would be under taken according to circumstances. The troops of the 7th Division consequently moved from their bivouacs on the left bank of the Tigris at about 1900, and the 21st and 19th Infantry Brigades, in this order from right to left, threw up about two miles of entrenchments to the north-east of Naasa, with the 19th and 20th Field Batteries in support. At the same time the 35th Infantry Brigade, with the 1-lst Sussex Field Battery in support, made a mile of trenches in a locality about two and a half miles to the north of Shaikh Saad and at the same distance from the 21st Brigade. The 9th Infantry Brigade, the bulk of which had come up from Musandaq, the battlefield of the 6th—yth January and now consisted of the l-4th Hampshire (less one company), the 2nd Rajputs (less two companies), the C)2nd Punjabis and the 107th124 Pioneers (less one company) ; the Cavalry Brigade, the Heavy Artillery, and the 61st Howitzer Battery, were posted on the left bank of the Tigris to the west of Shaikh Saad. This place was held by two companies of the 2nd Rajputs, a squadron of the 33rd Cavalry, and the bulk of the Provisional Battalion, the bridge of boats was secured by two com panies of the 128th Pioneers and the 13th Sappers and Miners ; 100 men of the Provisional Battalion guarded the shipping, and two com panies of the 128th, one company of the 107th, and 130 men of the Pro visional Battalion remained, with one gun-boat, on the battle-field of the 6th—9th January for the purpose of safeguarding the wounded. (Order of Battle is given at the end of the Article.) The 12th January was spent in reconnaissance and other prepara tions for the coming battle. The majority of the tributaries of the Tigris draw water from the river. But the Wadi, behind which the Turks had placed themselves, was a running stream that flowed into it and probably, therefore, could not be controlled by the enemy in the same manner as an irrigation channel into which water could be let, or from which it could be excluded by breaking or building up a dam across its mouth. It was, so far as the British were aware, at the moment fordable, and flowing between steep banks, but was liable to be flooded by rain fall in the Pusht-i-Kuh mountains. Except for the presence of the Wadi, of a walled enclosure known as Chittab's fort, some ruins of villages, and one or more huts of mud which were inhabited by Arabs, the battlefield was not different in character from that of Shaiks Saad. The dead, dun-coloured, monotonous level presented an unbroken horizon on every side. The area abounded in small banks and shallow irrigation channels which would either afford ready-made cover against shells and bullets, or would render the concealment of trenches and their parapets an easy matter. Near the Tigris and Wadi there were also deeper canals, still dry since the river had not risen sufficiently to bring water into them, and therefore providing covered ways. In many places too there was low scrub which would favour the concealment both of defences and personnel. The troops had however, now gained some experience of these conditions, and also of the disconcerting effect of the daily haze of fine dust blown up from the desert, and the deceptive mirage. The reports made by our airmen on the 12th showed that the Turks definitely intended to stand and were busy entrenching especially on their left, where a redoubt was being made at a distance of about two and a half miles from the Tigris. There were emplacements for four or six guns near the Turkish left, and for six more in or near the angle between the Wadi and Tigris; various camps had sprung ud behind the Wadi and it was estimated that 7,500 infantry and 1,200 mounted men had been seen by the airmen. There was also what appeared to&amp;125 be an advanced position on either side of Chittab's fort and at a distance of from 2,500—3,500 yards from our entrenchments. On the right bank of the Tigris there were a few trenches and a couple of gun-pits, but not more than 500 men. The British cavalry, who had gone out to cover the movements of two officers of the staff detailed both to Teconnoitre the ground which was to be crossed in the night march round the enemy's left, and to check the not too accurate sketch maps that had been compiled from the information provided by the airmen, had been fired on by Arabs from a large village lying seven and a half miles to the north-west of Shaikh Saad, but they had, in retaliation, killed 5 of the enemy and captured 30 prisoners. Towards evening Kemball had recalled the detachment which had been sent up-stream to make the demonstration, and had begun to pass his brigade over the river. Younghusband also commenced the concentration of his division, to which the 62nd Punjabis had been sent during the day. The British received, in addition, a welcome reinforcement, for the l-9th Gurkhas came up by steamer, and were attached to the 7th Division. The arrival of this unit, and that of some drafts, raised the strength of the Infantry to about 11,000 or 11,500 men; and the 93rd Burma Infantry also reached Shaikh Saad on the 13th January while the battle was in progress. The orders that had been circulated by General Aylmer were, in summary, as follows. After explaining that the enemy's troops were •still in the position which they had held on the 11th, he stated that it was his intention to deliver an attack at dawn on the 13th, turning the enemy's left or northern flank with a maximum force, while the front would be engaged by a minimum force. To this end the 7th Division, with the field and mountain batteries, was to march after dark to a position of assembly at a point three miles to the east of the ruins lying seven and a half miles to the north-northwest of Bnaikh Saad. The Cavalry Brigade was to follow the Division and remain with it until the morning of the 13th. The 28th Infantry Brigade was to relieve the 19th and 21st Brigade before darkness had fallen on the 12th, and during the night was to move two and a half miles further forward towards the right of the Turkish line. The Corps Artillery, •consisting of the 72nd and 77th four-gun 5 inch Howitzer Batteries, two guns of the 104th 4 inch Heavy Battery and the 61st six-gun 4-5 inch Howitzer Battery, would entrench in positions that had already been selected for them behind the 28th Brigade. At 0630 on the 13th (the sun would rise at about 0700, the 7th Division was to advance in echelon of brigades from the left, marching due west, and was to envelop the enemy's left by means of a wide turning movement in which the cavalry were to co-operate moving on the outer flank of the division. The function of the 28th Brigade would be to hold the enemy to their126 positions which would be bombarded by the Corps Artillery. The gun boats and their mine-sweepers were to pass through the bridge at 0630 and were to co-operate in the attack, and their left would be pro tected by a small column, consisting of two companies of the 2nd Rajputs from the post at Shaikh Saad, and one squadron of the 33rd Cavalry, which was to move up the right bank of the Tigris. The weak 9th Infantry Brigade would constitute the general reserve, and would be on the left bank to the west of Shaikh Saad, and bridgeheads would be prepared by the 13th Sappers and Miners. Only first line transport was to move with the fighting troops, but the second line transport was to be ready to march when required. Cooked rations for two days were to be carried by the men, and one additional cooked ration was to be placed in the second line transport. As the water in the Wadi was said to be brackish, arrangements must be made for the despatch of drinking water to the 7th Division. Corps headquarters would be in the river steamer ' Medjidieh.' Under these orders, then, the outflanking movement was to be con fided to a body of some fourteen and a half battalions, including two' companies of the 128th Pioneers, five regiments of Cavalry, and 30 guns, perhaps 10,000 fighting men ; while the direct attack was to be made by four battalions with 16 guns on land and those in the warships, or 2,500 fighting men on land ; but the primary function of the heavy guns was apparently to assist the advance of the outflanking forces. A group equal to about two battalions was to be in reserve, and two more battalions approximately were to be employed in miscellaneous duties. There are of course points in all orders and arrangements that are open to criticism, and in this case it may be objected that, even if it is admitted that the enemy's troops had shown but little enterprise at the battle of Shaikh Saad, and that such Arab units as were in the enemy's army were not of good quality, the detachment to which was entrusted the duty of holding fast the Turkish main body was some what weak adequately to fulfil its functions. It is a well known maxim that, for the attainment of success, concentration of force must be made at the decisive point; but concentration is a relative term, and it im plies the greatest force that can be devoted to a given purpose without prejudice to other essential obligations ; and the art of war lies largely in the most effective allotment of the troops that are available as bet ween various requirements. Another weakness inherent in a plan of t is nature is that close co-operation is seldom attained in such exten sively combined operations, and the enemy, therefore, can either avoid -he blow, or deal with the divided forces in detail. Some risk or dis- adrantage however, attends on every plan of operations. The more elaborate depend for success on the exact performance of several differentmovements, the more direct tend to resolve themselves into bludgeon work, and important results are then seldom attained. It is plainly most difficult to strike the happy mean, and whatever the plan, victory in every case is due rather to skill in executing than in projecting an operation. In this connection it may also be pointed out that General Aylmer's position was probably too far from the bulk of his corps, and from the chosen area of decisive operations. It is doubtless right for the com mander-in-chief of a large army to be well in rear during battle, and beyond the reach of distraction by local events ; but this maxim cannot be applied to small forces and especially when, as was now apparently the case, means of rapid commimication are wanting owing to the hurried improvisation of a Signal Service. It is suggested, therefore, that. General Aylmer should have placed his headquarters on the right flank where the decision was to be made. On board the u Medjidieh' he was not in a position to be able to influence the operations of the out flanking column ; and he could, in fact, only use his slender reserve to assist the remainder of the force in holding the enemy to their entrench ments, or in meeting a counter-attack which was not to be expected unless the operations against the Turkish left met with misfortune- As so important an operation was, however, confided to General Young- husband, it was surely superfluous to lay down the formation to be adopted when advancing from the position of assembly. In pursuance of the plan of the Commander of the Tigris Corps, Sir George Younghusband began, as has been stated, to withdraw his artillery during daylight to the rendezvous at the position occupied by the 35th Infantry Brigade, for the very broken ground near the river would render movement after nightfall a matter of great difficulty ; but the guns were first sent-towards Shaikh Saad, as if returning to camp for the night. The concentration of the division was completed by 2130 And, a quarter of an hour later, the march was commenced. The three Infantry Brigades fiad formed up in line of columns of fours with an interval of thirty yards between the brigades, the 35th, to which the 62nd Punjabis had been attached, being on the right, the 19th in the centre, and the 21st, with the addition of the 1/9th Gurkhas, on the left. A small advanced guard was supplied by the 19th Brigade, and the others were responsible for securing the flanks. The five batteries of artillery followed the infantry in line of battery columns, escorted by one company of the 128th Pioneers, then came the ambulances and the water supply column of twenty army transport carts, and lastly the rear guard of one company of the 128th. It seems that the 6th Cavalry Brigade followed the division. The mgbt was fine but cold, and there was a heavy dew. The moon was in the second quarter, and as the ground was level and the enemy's128 troops were not encountered, the division reached the position of deploy ment at midnight. The Infantry then formed up facing west in line of brigades ; each brigade was in line of battalions in column, with intervals of fifty yards between the battalions and the intervals between the Infantry Brigades were 1,000 yards. The other troops, including the Cavalry, were placed behind the Infantry, and when the deployment had been completed at 0230 the remainder of the night passed without incident. While this movement was in progress the Corps Artillery had taken the place of the batteries of the 9th Artillery Brigade, and the troops of the 28th Infantry Brigade had moved into the position evacuated by the 7th Division. As the leading units, the 56th Eilles and the Leicestershires, arrived after the division had marched off, some difficulty was experienced, owing to the broken nature of the ground, and the many irrigation channels, in finding the trenches ; but eventually the two battalions settled down to hold two miles of entrenchments. The other battalions did not get into position until 0330 on the 13th, and no farther forward movement was made partly for this reason, and also because the Turks were understood now to be in the trenches lying on either side of Chittab's fort. At daybreak, about 0700 on the 13th January, a thick mist rose and as a result the advance of the 7th Division could not be undertaken until about 0730. The brigades then pushed forward in echelon from the left, the 21st Infantry Brigade leading, the 19th Infantry Brigade 1,000 yards behind and at the same interval to the right, and lastly the 35th at a similar interval and distance. The 20th Field Battery was attached to the 21st Brigade, the rest of the artillery, the ambulances and the water-supply column followed the 19th Brigade, and the Cavalry Brigade marched on and secured the right of the divi sion. The troops of the 21st Infantry Brigade followed a compass bearing of 275°, the newly arrived l-9th Gurkhas and the 41st Dogras being in front, each in two lines of small columns, and the former furnished an advanced and a left flank guard. Four hundred yards behind were the 9th Bhopals and the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch, and then at 400 yards distance came the 6th Jats. The first line transport and the machine guns of the Brigade marched some hundreds of yards further back. There was practically no opposition, only a few Arabs being seen, and, at 0930, the Wadi was reached and crossed, the Infantry wading through two channels each with about two feet of running water. The unusually steep banks leading to and from the bed of the stream were, however, a serious obstacle for the guns and wheeled transport, and General Norie, therefore, halted until 1030 while the 9th Bhopals prepared ramps on both banks of the stream.At about 0900 the Cavalry Brigade had also passed over the ^ adi. in the vicinity of the village where opposition had been encountered on the 12th January. Again there was some firing, and a number of villagers and a few mounted Arabs hurried away upstream. As the guns of S. Battery were engaged in crossing the Wadi, fire was not opened by the British, but, soon afterwards, a body of about 800 Turkish horse men appeared in the area to the north west, and these were driven off by gun fire at a range of 3,500 yards. Meanwhile the 19th and 35th Infantry Brigades had reached and crossed the river ; but, although the two companies of the 128th Pioneers at once set to work to cut out a road for the main force of the artillery in the banks of the Wadi and neighbouring canals, the whole of the guns had not crossed until nearly 1300 much of the transport was not over by nightfall, and the ambulances were obliged to open and remain on the right bank from four to five miles from the scene of the fight. The task now allotted to the 21st Infantry Brigade was that its units were to advance and clear up the tactical situation ; that is to ascertain the positions of the enemy's entrenchments, and obtain infor mation as to the numbers and dispositions of the Turkish forces. General Norie was then to hold fast the troops that were garrisoning the left of the enemy's line, but without involving the Brigade in a close action, while the Artillery crossed the Wadi. Patrols apparently had not been sent forward for the purpose of locating the enemy's positions while the Bhopals were engaged in ramping the banks of the stream, as the country was so flat and featureless that there were no landmarks on which to direct them, it was also no doubt desired to keep the Turks as long as possible in ignorance of the presence of the 7th Division on their flank. The Brigade therefore marched off again on a bearing of 245°, covered by an advanced guard of the l-9th Gurkhas, and the enemy were not encountered until the leading company was shelled, at about 1045 by two Turkish guns that were now visible in the distance- A quarter ot an hour later heavy rifle and machine gun fire was opened from the left front, and apparently from a locality 1,200 yards away, towards which the Gurkhas now turned. The leading company was reinforced by another company shortly before noon, and, after advancing for a time by short rushes, the two were checked and obliged to entrench at a distance of 900 yards from the enemy. Orders were then sent up that the Gurkhas were not seriously to commit them selves in the fight, and the remainder of the battalion was therefore moved into a position behind the left of the advanced companies co as to protect their left flank. While this action had been in progress the 41st had also found them selves under the fire of artillery at about 1100 and then under enemy musketry which came in the greatest volume from their left front. No130 sign of the enemy's infantry could be seen, with, the exception of a body of about one and a half battalions which were 2,000 yards away and apparently moving up the Wadi against our left, but one gun was visible in the open 1,600 yards distant, and the rest of the battery could be distinguished a little further away and to the east. One company of the 41st now joined in the attack which was being made by the Gurkhas, but experienced heavy losses in attempting to close with the Turks- The remainder moved towards the single gun, and, as a result, were separated from the Gurkhas. The main body of the 41st was eventu ally stopped when within 1,000 yards of the gun by a violent rifle fire which was being delivered from a belt of old scrub. Meanwhile the 9th Bhopals had been thrust into the interval between the Gurkhas and the 41st, and the Black Watch had come up on the right of the latter. During the advance of his battalions General Norie had despatch ed a report to the headquarters of the 7th Division describing the situ ation, and at about noon he received directions to wait until the remainder of the guns, ^which were then crossing the Wadi, came into action before pressing forward. At the same time orders were sent out by General Younghusband that the 19th Brigade was to prolong the right flank of the 21st Brigade, and endeavour to outflank the enemy and to reach the Tigris. As soon as the main body of the artillery opened fire Norie gave instructions for his troops to go on, and for the 20th Battery which was already in action to move forward and support the Infantry more closely; he also put into the fight his last reserve, the 6th Jats. At 1300 therefore all five battalions of the 21st Brigade were engaged in a violent struggle with the Turks, who were both holding the trenches on the left of their line and were also lining a low bank or dam running, east and west across the space between the Wadi and the marsh. Some portions of the Infantry were not more than 150 yards from the Turks, and the 20th Battery was within a mile of the front of the Brigade and 2,700 yards from the enemy's £uns. The 19th, 28th, and 1-lst Sussex Batteries, and the 23rd Mountain Battery, were now firing from a position near the Wadi and some 4,000 yards behind the left of the 21st Brigade. But, owing both to the proxi mity of the Infantry to the enemy's position, and to the difficulty of maintaining communication with the artillerv observing officers because of the shortage of cable and other causes it seems that the gunners only fired iatermittently on the enemy's artillery and on any troops that were seen to be in movement, and not on the troops that were actually opposing the 21st Brigade. General Harvey, who was now commanding the 19th Infantry Brigade, had kept the Seaforths and 28th in hand 5 sending forward two battalions, the 125th or the left and the 92nd on the right, and these units only came under distant gun fire during the first two-131 miles of their march. A halt was then made for the purpose of carry ing out reconnaissance and in the course of their subsequent advance the 125th and 92nd began to operi out into extended order, and also brought their right shoulders up with the object of gaining touch with the 21st Brigade. When another mile and a half had been covered Turkish troops could be seen to the left front apparently in the act of withdrawing It seems that these troops escaped the notice of the British Artillery, which was some distance away and no doubt now hampered by the atmospheric conditions—mirage and dust; but, on coming under the fire of the rifles and machine guns of the men of the 19th Brigade, they at once took cover and began to reply. Both batta lions continued, however, to gain ground, and soon were so hotly engaged that, at about 1430 a company of the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders was sent up on the left of the 125th. This was followed at 1500 by a second company, and soon afterwards the 28th Punjabis moved forward and prolonged the right of the 92nd. The battle then remained stationary for some time, while our men hastily made cover for themselves and our guns occasionally fired a few rounds. Earlier in the day Younghusband had despatched two messages to the headquarters of the Tigris Corps. In the first, which was sent off at 0915 and received three hours later, he reported that the leading brigade had crossed the Wadi, that only a few Arabs had been encountered and these had retired to the north west before the Cavalry, and that the advance would be continued in a south westerly direction and towards the defile between the Tigris and the Suwaikiya marsh The second was despatched at 1330 and received at-1545 and was as follows i'Norie's Brigade attacking in a southwesterly direction, Harvey s Brigade prolonging down towards the river on Norie's right. All batteries m action also firing south west at 3,500 range at the rear of the enemy's guns and trenches. Enemy's guns firing directlv to their rear. From this it Mould appear that they are being pinched the 7tl1 Divisi0n - Eice ' s Bri g ade sti11 ^ reserve. (Ihe 35th Brigade after having assisted the transport across Wadi had moved to a position near the main body of the Artillery.) I don't tnmk we have roany casualties.' , ^ sta ® officer ' who tad gone down the Wadi for about half a mile beyond the left of our line, had reported that a body of three iurkish battalions was apparently retreating up the Tigris. Youno-- usband, who seems, as has been shown above, to have believed tlurt his division had almost cut off the Turkish troops standing on the Wadi from the Hanna defile, and that he and Kemball were the same entrenchments from different sides, now directed the 35th Infantrv Brigade, with the exception of the 102nd who remained to &lt;niaid the Artillery, to go in, and as he supposed closed the gap between the 19th132 Brigade and the Tigris. At the same time the four guns of the 23rd Mountain Battery were ordered to move to the right flank of the 19th: Brigade. General Rice accordingly sent instructions for the troops of the 35th Brigade to advance, the l-5th Buffs being on the right and the 97th on the left, each in two lines, the 37th in support and the 62nd in reserve. As the units went forward they were met with a fairly heavy fire of shrapnel, which inflicted a few casualties, but unfortu nately stampeded a large portion of the first line transport. The batta lions, however, pushed on, and when, at about 1715 a few minutes before sunset the Buffs came into line with the 28th Punjabis, the two rushed into the eye of the setting sun and drove back the Turks. Find ing themselves under enfilading fire the two battalions were then obliged to withdraw for a short distance and here they entrenched. The 23rd Mountain Battery did not reach the 19th Brigade until the light was too dim to permit of fire being opened. It is now time to refer again to the movements of the Cavalry Bri gade. After crossing the Wadi the brigade had, at 1045, gained a position on the right of the infantry and about two miles from them and here the Cavalry remained until noon. Soon afterwards the Turkish Cavalry came forward from the north west, but were shelled by the guns of S. Battery at a range of about 3,000 yards and driven off with loss. The Cavalry Brigade then moved westwards for a mile and sub sequently north westwards over the ground where the enemy's horsemen had been shelled, finding some wounded men who were made prisoners. At 1600 as a result of the report of the staff officer to which reference has been made above, the Brigade received orders to march southwards and cut the enemy's line of retreat up the Tigris. After advancing for some distance the troops came under the fire of Artillery and then under rifle fire, and, in order to avoid heavy casualties, they now fell back in a north westerly direction, halting not far from the Suwaikiya marsh. Here some Turkish Infantry who were occupying the edge of the marsh were driven away. At about 1610 when the mirage would have disappeared, troops had been observed by Younghusband to be advancing against the enemy's position from the direction of Shaikh Saad. This information was passed to all the infantry brigadiers, who were directed to press on their attacks if possible; and orders were also sent to the Cavalry to carry out a dismounted advance on the right of the 35th Brigade. At this time the 16th Cavalry were acting as escort to the Horse Artillery guns, and of the other regiments General Roberts ordered the 14th Hussars and the 4th Cavalry to deliver the attack, keeping the 7th Lancers and 33rd Cavalry as escort to the horses. The sun set on the 13th January at about 1720 and night therefore, was coming on before these units reached the neighbourhood of the 35th Infantry133 Brigade. In the dusk it seems that the troopers were mistaken for* Turks ? and coming under strong fire from our infantry they withdraw again to their horses. Later on the whole Brigade rode over to the Wadi and bivouacked near the headquarters of the 7th Division. At nightfall General Younghusband sent a message, which was^ received at 1910 by General Aylmer, as follows : My troops ring round the Turks except for a small portion by river which I hope to fill shortly. Troops from the direction of Shaikh Saad are advancing and heavy fire still going on. Troops taking up positions they now hold for night, our cavalry have operated on my right flank/' Later on the further report in regard to the dispositions of the 7th Division, was made in greater detail, and this was received at about 2300 at the headquarters of the Tigris Corps. But, as will appear. General Aylmer had, through the Flying Corps, already gained a more just appreciation of the position of the division then was actually possessed by its commander. Early in the morning General Kemball had been informed that the batteries of the Corps Artillery were earmarked for the support of the 7th Division. They might, however, as a temporary measure, be used to assist the 28th Brigade in the advance against Chittab's fort and the trenches on either side of it, which were believed to be held by the enemy. KembalTs reconnoitring patrols had at first stated that Chittab's fort was strongly garrisoned, and soon after 0900 the guns, therefore, commenced firing on it; but later reports were to the effect that only a few scouts could be seen to the east of the 'Wadi. It seems that the first reconnaissance by aeroplane was made at about 0900 and, an hour later, the airman, after having circled over the 28th Brigade as a signal that the Turks were not holding the trenches near Chittab's fort, made his report. This was to the effect that no Turks had been seen in the area between the 28th Brigade and the enemy's main position on the Wadi, which was apparently held by 2,000 Infantry and 500 Cavalry. Six of the enemy's guns also were being moved along a route leading to the Turkish left. Three gun boats, the Gadfly, Cranefly and Dragonfly, the Butterfly had been left at Shaikh Saad to assist the troops in safeguarding the bridge, had meanwhile drawn level with Kemball's Infantry. At about 1100 these gun-boats, which had then steamed to a point some 7,000 yards from Ora, the right bank column being on their left flank at Umm-al Tamman, opened on the right of the Turkish position. Kemball now began to advance, the Leicestershires moving forward on the left and the 56th Eifles on the right, followed by the 53rd and 51st Sikhs. No resistance was encountered, and, after the fort had been occupied at about noon, the troops threw up a line of trenches134 facing nortii west and half a mile beyond it, the gun fire of the / th Division away to the north being now distinctly audible. The Corps Artillerv, which had followed the 28th Brigade, then came into action near Chittab's fort and registered on a few Turkish entrenchments that were visible from this building, while patrols from the units of the 28th Brigade reconnoitred the enemy s position care fully The reports that were brought in by these patrols were to the effect that the Turks were holding a position behind the Wadi, and about one and a halt miles from the localities that had been occupied by the 28th Brigade; and that the enemy were m loop-holed trenches and were still engaged in digging themselves in. But it seems that the existence of a position consisting of a Une of small redoubts, with low parapets, placed in a slight depression behind the trenches was not definitely ascertained. \t about 1400 another reconnaissance was made by air, and on the return of the airman; Aylmer learnt that the 19th and 21st Brigades, supported S ,y 26 guns, were advancing southwards m the area between the Wadi and the Suwaikiya marsh and at right angles to the enemy s left whil. the 35th Infantry Brigade was in reserve near the Wadi. The British were being onposed by a line of Turks, supported apparently by four guns which were firing from the left of the original position on the Wadi. The gap at Hanna had been entrenched and was held by a couple of hundred infantry who were near the marsh. A column of 4,000 men had also been seen which was apparently moving up river irom Hanna. There were four guns behind the Turkish right on the left bauk, but on the right bank only a few Arabs. The substance of this message was passed to Kemball, and reached him at about 1600 and as his own patrols had recently reported that the bombardment now being made by the ships, which after dropping down-stream were again moving forward, and heavy guns were causing the enemy to evacuate their position that is the advanced trenches that were visible on the bank of the Wadi—Kemball resolved to deliver an assault alter communicating with the gun boats and securing the promise of support from their guns. Orders accordingly were issued that the brigade was to advance and break through the portion of the Turkish line which lay opposite to its right, and then drive the enemy's troops southwards against the bank of the river. The principal attack was confided to the 56th Rifles with the support of the 53rd Sikhs : the Leicestershires were to advance on their left followed by two com panies, of the 51st Sikhs, and the remainder of this regiment was to be held in reserve. ^ The 66th accordingly went forward, two companies forming the firing line and two being in support, followed by the 53rd ; and covered135 ft&gt;j our gun fire the men made rapid progress. The enemy reserved ttheir fire until the leading companies were 600 yards from the main position, which was invisible from our batteries, and was about 400 yards beyond the Wadi, and then a stream of shell and bullets was poured out against our troops. Fortunately the fire was ill-directed, most of the bullets going high above the heads of the men. They were able, therefore, to reach a water cut lying 100 yards from the Wadi^ where the reserve companies joined the firing line, but in doing so di rcnrged '•somewhat outwards. The bulk of the 56th, followed by a large propor tion of the 53rd, now again rushed forward in well ordered lines, but were met with so violent and well aimed a fire that comparatively few men reached the further bank of the Wadi after wading waist deep through the stream. As the enemy were untouched and therefore unshaken by our gun fire, the men of the two battalions, after waiting for some time under the cover oi the right bank ot the Wadi, fell back in the dusk to the water cut, where additional cover was hurriedly improvised, and the wounded were collected. Since neither food nor ■ammunition came up to them, and the 51st Sikhs who were in reserve could not be found, those portions of the 56th and 53rd that had made the assault eventually withdrew to Chittab's fort, which was reached at 0200 on the 14th January. The Leicestershire battalion also failed to gain the enemy's position a Its advance had, for some distance, been prosecuted without oppose tion, but when the leading companies were about 1,100 yards from the Wadi, a strong fire was opened from a line of trenches beyond it. The British, however, pushed steadily forward, and, at about 1645 had reached a point about 450 yards from the enemy. Just when preparations were being made for the delivery of an assault, the men found themselves under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns which was being delivered from the area beyond their right flank. The 56th had disappeared, only a few men of the 51st were visible away to the right, and, in these circumstances, and also since the gun boats had been obliged by the fire of the Turkish artillery to withdraw to the vicinity of Umm-al-Tamman, the commander of the Leicestershires decided to entrench the ground that was being occupied by the battalion, refusing both of its flanks. At 2000, touch was established with about 100 men of the 51st, 53rd and 56th, with whom were some Gurkhas, and the little force then settled down for the night to hold a line about 600 yards in length. At 2300 however, verbal orders were received that the group was to fall back for half a mile and again entrench ; and this retirement had been completed by 0230 on the 14th January. The Turks made no attempt directly to interfere with this detachment, although their desultory firing, which occasionally became violent, continued throughout the night.136 The general reserve did not take any part in tlie fighting on tha 13th January. Early in the morning the 9th Infantry Brigade had advanced to the vicinity of Naasa, and here it remained until ? at 1600 the observer on a tower of scaffolding that had been erected at Shaikh. Saad, reported to General Aylmer that the Gadfly and the other gun. boats were again moving up-stream. Orders were now sent to the* Brigade to advance to the support of General Kemball. This was- done, but Chittab's fort was not reached until 1830 when the troops in the darkness found some difficulty in passing through the transport that was collected there, and also in getting clear of the Corps Artillery. Eventually the Brigade took up a line of outposts in the vicinity of tlm fort, and covering the troops round it. As soon as General Aylmer had ascertained what was the situation of his force at nightfall, directions were sent out for the renewal of the attack on the 14th January. Younghusband was warned in regard to the possibility of a counter attack by the 4,000 Turks that had been seen in the Hanna-Sannaiyat defile, he was informed of the failure of the 28th Brigade and was asked to report in cipher the exact posi tions of his troops. Notification was sent to the gun boats and to the right bank column, which had returned at dusk to Shaikh Saad, that the action would be continued on the next day ; and two companies, of the 128th and one company of the 107th which had come up from the battle field of the 6th—9th January, were ordered to escort two loads of hand-grenades to Chittab's fort, arriving there not later than 0700 on the 14th. At 2200 Kemball reported fully on the situation of his Brigade, and he subsequently received orders that a further assault was not to be attempted until powerful support on the part ot the Artillery could be assured for the infantry. At 2315 in notifying the positions of the units of the 7th Division, Younghusband stated that two four-gun enemy batteries had been seen on the bank of the Tigris, but that through out the afternoon the Turks had been retiring westwards. The night of the 13-14th January, which was cold and windy, passed without any attack being made on the 7th Division. The Turks, how ever, maintained an unremitting fire which occasionally increased into great violence, one burst of musketry at about 0400 after which it. appears that the enemy finally withdrew, being unusually prolonged.. The British nevertheless replenished ammunition, collected wounded, and as far as was practicable issued water to the men. Early on the 14th the infantry patrols of the division found that the enemy's line; was empty and learnt from a few prisoners that the Turks had fallen back. Later on a squadron of the 7th Lancers reported that what appeared to be a rear guard was entrenching in the Hanna defile, whila137 other units seemed to be withdrawing. But when the Cavalry Brigade advanced, the Turkish guns opened fire causing a few casualties. After having sent a report to General Aylmer, Younghusband ordered the 35th Infantry Brigade and the 20th Field Battery to march at 0800 to the Tigris in support of the Cavalry; and an hour later this Brigade was directed to move towards and close the Hanna defile while the two other brigades moved down to the river. It seems that these orders were varied, for it appears that the 35th and 19th Brigades and the artillery reached the bank of the Tigris at 1000 but the 21st Bri gade did not come up until some hours later. After the 35th Brigade had arrived on the bank of the river one of its companies was sent for ward towards Hanna, and it was then ascertained that the enemy were entrenched there on a frontage of some 2,000 yards ; and against this position the 28th Field Battery subsequently fired a few rounds. Not long afterwards the Turkish Artillery opened fire, and as a result the 35th Brigade was left to take up a line of outposts along a frontage about two miles from Hanna, the Artillery being in observation behind it, and the Cavalry watching the northern flank ; but the remainder of the division went into bivouac further down the Tigris. The weather was now dull and cold, and a gale of wind was blowing which raised clouds of dust. Nevertheless desultory firing went on throughout the day^ and, at 1300 the Gadfly, which had steamed forward to assist the Infantry, should this be necessary, was hit and a good deal damaged by a shell fired by the Turks from a 4-8 inch gun. Fortunately, however, the shell did not burst. After sending the 9th Infantry Brigade forward early on the 14th to entrench along a line about 1,200 yards from the Wadi. Kembali had observed what were taken to be masses of the enemy retiring slowly towards Hanna. A message consequently was sent to the headquarters of the Corps that reconnaissance was being made and that the Brigade would push forward in pursuit. It seems, however, that the troops that were seen by Kemball's men were the 35th and 19th Brigades, and when their presence had definitely been ascertained, the 28th Brigade' and the great part of the 9th Brigade moved to the Wadi and halted in the angle between this stream and the Tigris ; but the 107th Pioneers were left to clear the battlefield, and the 128th set to work to ramp the banks of the Wadi at a ford near its mouth so as to enable the heavy artillery, and the second line transport, which was now being brought forward, to cross over the stream. The passage of the Wadi proved to be by no means an easy operation, and it was 1500 before the Corps Artillery began to undertake it. The greater part of the guns crossed in safety but the two guns of the 104th Heavy Battery were unable to pass through the ford, and it was therefore late in the afternoon before any of the transport vehicles could begin to move over. Heavy rain k 2138 began to fall in tlie evening, and the bottom of the ford had by this time also been churned into a morass. The last of the transport in consequence did not reach the right bank until noon on the 15th January. Owing to the gale and strong current in the Tigris the bulk of the shipping also was unable to gain the Wadi during the 14th. In the course of the morning General Aylmer had received from an airman confirmation of the reports that the enemy were holding the mouth of the Hanna defile, and at noon and again an hour later he warned the 7th Division not to attempt a further attack until the position had been subjected to a strong bombardment. At about 1600 a message came in from Younghusband that the 7th Division had been concentrated in the area lying opposite to the ruins which were about two miles above Ora ; that reconnaissance was in progress, and that the guns were ready to open fire. In the evening represen tations seem however, to have been made to General Aylmer, who had reached the bivouac of Kemball's brigade, that the Turkish posi tion was too strong to be carried by means of a frontal attack. It was also pointed out that many units both of the 7th Division and 28th Brigade were without rations. The idea of a further advance was, therefore, abandoned for the time being. After nightfall a company of the 93rd was sent to the right bank so as to secure the ' Medjidieh and the gun boats from the fire of marauders, and the rest of the force remained, drenched and miserable, in the downpour on the left bank of the Tigris. From the statements of prisoners captured in the battle it was ascertained that the British had been opposed by the reconstituted 35th Division (the combined 35th and 38th Divisions) and the 52nd Division numbering about 11,000 fighting men, besides cavalry and eamelmen. Practically the whole of this force was on the left bank of the Tigris, for the large majority of the troops that had been engaged with the 28th Brigade at Shaikh Saad had afterwards been ferried across the Tigris in kalaks (rafts on inflated skins) and kufialis (coracles). The numbers in action on each side, therefore, were approximately equal. , Although the Turks were certainly out-manoeuvred there can be no question that the results of the action were disappointing for the British, since they were unable to exploit the surprise which was in the first instance inflicted on the enemy. The action was not fought altogether on the lines indicated in General Aylmer's orders, for the 28th Brigade was held back until it was ascertained that the Turks were not occupying the trenches near Chittab's fort instead of engaging the front of the enemy's position. Further, this Brigade, as it turned out, was not sufficiently powerful to hold fast the main body of the Turkish forces in their trenches. As a result no portion of the enemy s139 army was in fact attacked from two directions. But, apart from this, the cause of the failure seems to have lain in the time expended in moving Younghusband's artillery over the Wadi and neighbouring channels, a difficulty which might, it may be supposed, have been foreseen and discounted and from this it resulted that the bulk of the infantry did not at once deliver their attack. The Turks, therefore, were given time in which to readjust their dispositions, and, after moving through a belt of scrub, the Turkish Infantry either occupied the disused irri gation channels with which the whole face of the ground was wrinkled or obtained cover behind a dyke which had been made by the Arabs for the purpose of controlling the annual floods. When the attack was made the British Infantry did not at first receive the strong support which is necessary for the reduction of the enemy's power of resistance. Owing to lack of means of communicating effectively between the ob servers and gunners, and to the influence of the mirage on visibility^ the fire of the artillery could not subsequently be directed on the enemy's positions, and the infantry therefore failed to carry them. It is never easy to maintain direction and to apply the sense of locality when in action, for many things then combine to focus atten tion on other purposes and in any circumstances it is most difficult to do so when the ground is absolutely flat and without features. Addi tional difficulties were created for the British by the fact that the maps that were available were not accurate, and it seems, therefore, that General Younghusband believed that he had almost surrounded the Turks, whereas, in fact, his troops were facing south and south-west and were at some distance from the river. Had this been realised his measures would certainly have been different from those which were actually taken, and the battle might have ended more favourably for the British. As in the case of the 7th Division, but for other reasons, the attack of the 28th Infantry Brigade, which under better auspices might have been decisive, failed through lack of artillery support. In the end, therefore, the British bought a barren success at the cost of 1,613 casualties, 218 of whom were killed ; and they did not find them selves any nearer the fulfilment of their task.CHAPTER XL The battle of Hanna, 21st January 1916. By Major-General Sir W. D. Bird , K .B .E., C .B., C.M.G., D .S .O. (Tliis narrative is a sequel to the accounts of the battles of Shaikh Saad and Wadi. It is based on the War Diaries, to which I was most kindly permitted to have access. I was also able to consult ' My Campaign in Mesopotamia ' by Major-Gencral Sir Charles Townshend.) Although some reports had been sent on the 13th January 1916, to General Townshend in Kut-al-Amara, and to General Sir John Nixon at Basra during the turmoil of the battle of Wadi, General Aylmer had necessarily ceased to forward frequent and detailed reports either to the 6th Division or to General Headquarters ; and both had, in consequence, become somewhat impatient over the comparative absence of information from the front. On the afternoon of the 14th January Townshend had telegraphed to General Aylmer news that columns of artillery, followed by infantry, were marching westwards up the left bank of the Tigris, which appeared, he said, to betoken that the Turks were not taking up the position at Es Sinn, but were in retreat. On the morning of the 15th he telegraphed that the enemy were encamped ns usual, but might retreat during the 16th, that our gun-boats had not yet come into sight, that it was presumed that the relieving force was opposed by a strong rear-guard, and that it was hoped that the Turks would not change their minds and return to the positions on the left bank opposite to the Es Sinn banks. It seems that this message was erossed by a telegram from Aylmer, who necessarily was in a far better position to make a just estimate as to the significance of the enemy's operations than ^vas General Townshend ; and in this the commander of the Tigris Corps pointed out that the Turkish troops which had been seen by the garrison were probably marching to their bridge at the Abu Dhakhar bend of the Tigris, and asked that a sharp lookout might be kept for enemy movements on the right bank of the river. Heavv rain had meanwhile commenced in the evening of the Mth January, and the 15th was again a day of chilling gale and driving rain. As a result the bridge of boats over the Tigris that was being made by the British above the mouth of the Widi cculd not hd completed, aerial reconnaissance was impracticable, and the British troops—the 7th Division, the 9th and 28th Infantry Brigades, the Cavalry Brigade, etc.—remained facing the defile at Hanna, and on the left bank of the ( HO )141 Tigris in the areas opposite to Ora, very mucli in the positions tLat had been held on the 14th ; but a detachment on the right bank con sisting of the 1-lst Gurkhas, the 93rd, two guns of the 23rd Mountain Battery and one squadron of the 33rd Cavalry secured the shipping and camps from Arab sharp-shooters. During the 15th January a couple of telegrams were sent to General Headquarters, and repeated to General Townshend, describing the •situation at the front. In the first Aylmer observed that the reports irom Townshend indicated clearly that the Turks intended to delay the British in the long Hanna-Sannaiyat defile. They would then probably 'bring a large force down the right bank for the purpose of fighting a tattle at Es Sinn, or further down the river, and severing the commu- mications of the British with Basra. In order that the Tigris Corjs ?might be in a position to meet the enemy on the right bank a bridge was 'made over the Tigris, and when completed all troops, except those be longing to the 7th Division (commanded by General Younghusband) would be moved over the river. In the second message the number ^of casualties (1,613) that had been experienced at the battle of Wadi, and the disabling of the gun-boat Gadfly by a shell, were men- Itioned. This statement did not apparently satisfy General Townshend, for lie telegraphed on the 16th that the guns which had been seen were four r quick-firers, six 16-pounders and two others, and also furnished a list '•©f their wagons. The presence of stragglers and wounded, it was pointed €ut, gave the troops the appearance of a defeated, not a manoeuvring, force. The losses of the enemy, also, could, he said, not have been less than those of the British, and it was entirely foreign to the nature of the Turk, or to that of the troops of any other nation, to march 27 imiles in retreat and then cross a river for the purpose of fighting again, Finally the opinion was hazarded that the enemy's units had not been iferried from the right to the left bank of the Tigris after the battle of Shaikh Saad and that the 6 battalions which had opposed Kemball's :28th Brigade in this battle were still south of the river. It was suggested, in addition, that operations along the right bank of the Tigris afforded a better chance of victory than did those on the left tank. Before this some plain speaking had also been taking place between Kut-al-Amara and the Tigris Corps on the wireless. At 2100 on the 15th January a message had been received from General Townshecd who expressed hiimaself as deeply concerned that no news of the move- :inents of the relieving force had reached Kut-al-Amara siuce 1135 on the 14th. The 15th January had been reached, and this was the •date beyond which Aylmer had himself stated that it would be hazardous ^o expect the garrison to hold out. Townshend then complained that142 lie had shut himself up in Kut-al-Amara on the understanding that the- place was to be relieved in a month, but the garrison had now been i»vested for six weeks. After remarking that it had been understood! that the enemy had been driven from their positions on the Wadi early on the 14th, he ended the message with the supposition that the Turks- were i fighting actions to gain time for the arrival of reinforcements. Later on Townshend again telegraphed in response to an enquiry from Sir John Nixon, that the siege of Kut had now been converted into a block'- ade investment. The area on the right bank of the Tigris facing the- eastern front of the place had practically been denuded of troops. Enemjr ♦ camelmen had been seen on the left bank opposite to the Sinn ridge (banks) throughout the day. A large camp had appeared'in the evenings near the Dujaila canal on the right bank, and the attempts of the Turks^ to construct a bridge over the Hai at the point about two and a half miles to the south of Kut-al-Amara had been stopped by our gun fire- Large convoys had gone north and west but not east from? the camp om the left bank at the Shumran bend. At about midnight General Aylmer unburdened his mind' both to* General Headquarters and to Townshend as follows* :— £ ' The position of affairs must be, frankly faced. The enemy is blocking the entrance of ihe Wadi-Nukhailat defile with very- strong works, and, judging from his dispositions within them^- they have been designed to resist a big bombardment from across the river as well as attack in front. His bivouac shelters seem to indicate that he may have with him the whole 52nd? Division, and two regiments (six battalions) of the 35th and 38th Divisions, but of course I cannot be certain of this. Em placements for nineteen guns have been seen, eleven of which are designed to fire across the river. Behind the defile there' is a single line of entrenchments through the Y of Sannaiyat between the marsh and river, probably one and a half miles; long. Behind again is the Es Sinn position. It is impossible^ in my opinion, to take this first position by a cowp-de -main from this side alone without losing half the force. It is my inteution to cross the 3rd Division (now formed under Major- General H. D'U. Keary, who had reached the front with his staff on the 14th January) and Cavalry Brigade to the right bank directly the bridge is finished, and thus enfilade the { enemy &amp; position. Even by this means I do not think that? progress as an entire force can be anything but very slow*^ * Thjs telegram is quoted in My Campaign in M^opotamiaJ* Major-General C, Townshend. v *143 Information indicates tliat reinforcements* may have begum to arrive at Kut, and these may soon amount to a considerable- number. On the right bank below Kut at present there do^ not seem to be at the outside more than 2,000 men and rain is- evidently rendering Hai crossing difficult for transport. The best plan seems to me for Townshend to cross the river during T the night with such able-bodied men as he has got in mahailas (barges) or other river transport available, and march well round the Es Sinn position on the right bank. I would cross- one division and cavalry brigade at the same time and marcL to meet him and bring him back here. The opportunity is^ now favourable and may cease directly the enemy sends troops down the right bank which may be very soon. On the 20th December Townshend informed me that he had fifty mahailas* besides other river craft. If these still exist it should be about sufficient for his purpose though he would have to leave sick unable to march and destroy his guns and material. If Town shend thinks this possible I shall issue ordersf for him to do so.- The Commander, 6th Division, is requested to wire at once feasibility of passage and earliest date he can be ready, re membering opportunity may not recur.' General Headquarters took but little time for the consideration of this proposal, and early on the 17th Sir John Nixon telegraphed both to Aylmer and Townshend as followst :— I do not in any way agree with your appreciation of the situation or that the same calls for Townshend to take the extreme step that you propose. The only circumstance that could, in my opinion, justify this course would be the demoralisation of your force which I have no reason to suspect. You have been opposed from Shaikh Saad by the 35th and 38tk and 52nd Divisions^, some gendarmerie and cavalry, totalling over 15,000 with at the outside 41 guns, and you have twice defeated them^ Townshend has been contained by the 45th and 51st Divisions totalling 8,000 with 17 guns. Townshend has reported a strong column estimated at one division and 13 guns retiring to * The enemy's army on the Tigris was thought to be tinder the command of Khalfl' Pasha, and to comprise the 13th Corps composed of the amalgamated 35th and 38th Arab Divisions, officered by Turks, and the 52nd, a Turkish Division, the Corps being commanded by Ali Najip Bey ; and the 18th Corps made up of the 45th, a Turko-Arab Division, and the 51st, a Turkish Division. Reinforcements, prol ably one division, were said to be moving to the Tigris front from Baghdad, and further reinforcements were, it was supposed, being sent from Aleppo. f The troops in Kut-al-Amara had been placed under the orders of General Aylmec for certain purposes. J This telegram is quoted in 'My Campaign in Mesopotamia,' Major-General Sir C. Townshend. '144 the main camp west of Kut. The enemy have suffered losses estimated by you at 4,500 at Shaikh Said and 2,000 at Wadi. You therefore should have between you and Kut not more than 5,000 with possibly 27 guns. The total of your losses {about 5,620 men) should almost have been made up by re inforcing units. Your bridge gives you freedom of manoeuvre. The course you or ginally proposed, namely, to employ part of your force on right bank, should not only promise success but afford you opportunity of inflicting a severe blow on the enemy and effecting the speedy relief of Townshend. I cannot believe that the position in front of you can equal in strength those attacked and captured by us in the past which had been in preparation for four months. The course you now propose for Townshend in your telegram under reply would be disastrous from every point of view to Townshend's force, to your force, to the whole force in Mesopotamia and to the Empire, and I cannot sanction it. There is no reason to suppose the enemy has been reinforced by a sixth division and the possible arrival of it only emphasises the necessity for action.' General Townshend's reply to General Aylmer began with the assump tion that the latter would advance on the right bank with a maximum force leaving a minimum detachment on the left bank for the purpose of securing the shipping on which the British were dependent both for supplies and munitions ; for, in his opinion, the Turks would not be in a position to undertake an offensive on the left bank so long as the British held Kut-al-Amara. He then pointed out that it would not be possible for the troops in Kut-al-Amara to gain the right bank of the Tigris with rapidity and security unless the relieving force were in posi tion to the south of the place ; and here the Hai, which was now five ieet deep at the fords, would lie between the British and the enemy. It was added that, while 4,000 men could be ferried over the Tigris in one night, twenty hours would be required for the passage of guns, and •seventy-five hours for that of the chargers and transport and other animals belonging to the troops of the garrison. This telegram produced a considerable correspondence as to whether Kut should or should not be evacuated after the two British forces had joined hands ; and in the course of this correspondence Townshend stated that a sortie in force as originally contemplated by Aylmer would, in his judgment, lead to the destruction of the men who had crossed the river, as soon as day dawned. In the end Nixon laid down that the British should re-establish and hold the position at Kut-al-Amara after its relief ; that the abandonment of the place, and its guns, stores, etc., would be destructive to prestige and was quite uncalled for ; that the forces under Aylmer and Townshend should be able after the relief145 tto maintain themselves at Kut pending the arrival of reinforcements ; and that, by the first week in February, including the garrison of Kut- al-Amara, four full divisions would be available for an offensive with a view to securing a permanent position to the west of and covering the town. Townshend was, further, to submit proposals as to the manner in which the Tigris Corps could best be disposed after the arrival ©f the relieving force at Kut, so as to fit in with this plan of operations. The settlement of this matter did not, however, affect the immediate problem facing the British commanders, which, as is common in war, was one involving a decision in regard to the use that could best be made of time. To make this decision would involve in the first place an ac curate adjustment of thoughts to things. This is never easy of attain ment, and is particularly difficult when in the field, for the reason that to bring thoughts into correct correspondence with things requires that the whole of the factors materially affecting the situation should be known, which can rarely be the case ; and also because of the influence that is exercised on thought by emotions that can never readily be controlled and are, of necessity, much agitated when on service. The fact that the responsibility for reaching a decision rested to some extent with three separate authorities, rather than with one central authority, would also militate against the formation of a sound judgment ; for a proper conclusion could only be reached after weighing such factors as the conditions prevalent at the front and the practicability of forcing the enemy's position at Hanna ; the power of endurance possessed by the garrison of Kut-al-Amara ; the rate at which reinforcements could reach the British and Turkish armies—the evacuation of Helles by the British had, it may be noted, now set free Turkish forces which were previously holding the Gallipoli peninsula, but a Russian detachment was advancing on Hamadan through Persia—and the possibility that the enemy might throw up entrenchments which would be impregnable to any army that could be collected and maintained by the British in the interval before the troops in Kut-al-Amara would either be starved into surrender, or the country would be inundated by the arrival of floods caused by the melting of the snow in the Armenian and Persian highlands. It is also not improbable that neither Sir John Nixon, nor Sir Fen- ton Aylmer, nor General Townshend was with reference to mood and environment well situated for making, or assisting to make, this im portant decision. Sir John was in bad health ; he had accepted a heavy responsibility as regards the occupation and retention of Kut-al-Amara ; and he could hardly be expected to appreciate to the full the great physical difficulties that now faced General Aylmer, unless he either himself proceeded to the front or sent the senior officer of his General Staff to report on the situation at Wadi. Nor does General Nixon seem to have146 realised how laj-ge was the difference in efficiency between the gallant but inexperienced force that was now opposing Turkish troops of better quality than had been encountered by the British in Mesopotamia prior to the battle of Ctesiphon, and the British veterans of the earlier stages of the campaign. Of all our senses the eyes are said to be most easily vanquished by events, and since what is seen reacts at once on emotion and thought, General Aylmer, who must have been very conscious of the visible difficulties of his position, may have been inclined to regard the situation as being darker than was actually the case. Further, he had been overwhelmed with the work of organising, almost single handed,, his corps, and had been harassed and disappointed by the occurrence in battle of incidents due to its shortcomings. Townshend was naturally anxious as to the future of the garrison of Kut-al-Amara, and annoyed that his confident anticipations of early relief had not been fulfilled; and his conclusions, therefore, were likely to be swayed as much by these feelings as by other considerations. It may be, then, that General Townshend expected too much and was prepared to give too little ; that General Aylmer was unduly de pressed ; and that Sir John Nixon was inclined to adopt too sanguine a view of the situation, especially as regards the numbers that were resisting the British, for the Turks would hardly make all their effective movements up and down the Tigris in full sight of the garrison of Kut-al- Amara. But whether this was or was not the case, the question was one demanding intense and cool reflection, and Sir John Nixon's telegram of the 17th was not at all calculated to produce a mental attitude favour able for these on the part of Sir Fenton Aylmer. The bridge over the Tigris after having been completed had mean while been broken by one of the steamers which had been carried against it by wind and current. During the 16th January repairs could not be effected owing both to the continuance of gales and bad weather, and to the exhaustion of the little group of Sappers and Miners. The sur face of the plain had now become so sodden and heavy as to be barely traversable by infantry, and to cover even a short distance involved considerable exertion. Exposure to cold winds and rain was also telling on the health of the force, whose fighting strength, as regards infantry^ did not at the moment exceed 9,000 men. At Kut-al-Amara too the troops in the trenches had been standing waist deep in water, and some men had even succumbed to the hardships to which they had been sub jected. The bad weather had unfortunately also the effect of checking the movements of the whole of the reinforcements and drafts that were on the march from Basra. On the 16th January there were for instance, more than 1,000 Indian drafts, who were held up at Amara ; the 3rd Sappers and Miners, the 59th Scinde Rifles, the 89th Punjabis, certain147 Ambulance units and about 400 British and 850 Indian drafts were obliged to bait between Amara and Qurna ; the l-6th Devonshire Kegi- ment, the 26th Punjabis and 165 Indian drafts had been forced to re main at Qurna ; and at Kurmat Ali there were the 1st Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry, the 34th Sikh Pioneers, the 21st Sappers and Miners, one section of the 23rd Mountain Battery, 1,850 British and 1,000 Indian drafts besides Ambulance and Veterinary units. Some delay occurred likewise in the movements of the river steamers carrying other units such as the 47th Sikhs and 27th Punjabis, but fortunately two companies of the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the Connaught Rangers reached the front on the 19th January. The troops facing Hanna had continued their efforts to advance in spite of storm and rain, and the 19th and 35th Infantry Brigades had been able to push their trenches somewhat nearer to those of the enemy. There was no material change in the dispositions of the remainder of the Tigris Corps, which lay to the West of the Wadi, except that the detachment on the right bank of the Tigris had now been joined by the l-9th Gurkhas. Nor did the information obtained in a couple of re connaissances by air reveal much alteration in those of the enemy. General Townshend sent a report on the evening of the 16th January to the effect that a large convoy had moved eastwards along the left bank of the Tigris, that digging on this bank was in progress below Kut- al-Amara, and that wire entanglements were being erected in front of the new trenches. He also conveyed to General Aylmer the important news that rations were still available in Kut-al-Amara for 21 days for British troops, and for Indian troops for 17 days. There was fodder for 5 days, meat on the hoof for 17 days and 3 days' supply of tinned meat. So far as the question of food was concerned, the relief of the garrison was, therefore, not a matter of great urgency. In view of the other factors mentioned above, such as the possibility that the Turks would soon receive reinforcements, and that if the British paused in their advance time would be allowed to the enemy for the strengthening of their positions and improvement of communications ; it was, however, apparently considered by General Headquarters that further efforts must at once be made to effect an early junction between the two British forces, the Tigris Corps and garrison of Kut-al-Amara. On the 18th, in replying to a long telegram from General Aylmer in which reference was made to the effect that the bridge had again been broken on the 17th, and that the meteorological conditions were extraordinarily unfavour able, it was consequently remarked that : ' The Army Commander 51 * General Sir John Nixon was invalided on the 18th Jaauary.148 recognises the difficulties caused by the prevalence of bad weather,, but can you give no estimate as to when you will be able to continue the offensive and your plans for the same ? Conditions must make the enemy's supply question very difficult and should prevent withdrawal of his guns. Have you made any progress on the right bank ?' This telegram provoked a reply to the effect that heavy rain h^d continued throughout the night of the 17-18th, and that the combina tion of a strong current and violent gale had again caused the bridge to- break. Shortage of bridging material and the unseaworthiness of the native boats would hinder repairs, and it was therefore probable that operations would have to be undertaken by the British without liberty of manoeuvre between the two banks of the Tigris. Troops would, how ever, be transferred to the right bank by steamer and barge, and already three battalions with four mountain guns were on this side of the river. Orders had been issued that the 7th Division was to close on to the enemy's positions, and these would be subjected to bombardment with high explosive shell and shrapnel from both banks on the 19th and night of the 19-20th. An assault would be delivered by the 7th Division on the 20th against the portion of the position closing the mouth of the Harm a defile which lay nearer to the Tigris. This plan was approved by the Commander-in-Chief, who in consequence accepted responsibility for its general efficiency. Owing to continuance of unfavourable weather it was not carried out until the 21st January, and ample time therefore was allowed to the Turks for the strengthening of their entrenchments. Before dealing with the tactical alternatives that were open to General Aylmer, an attempt must be made to describe the special characteristics of the battlefield. Mirage, accompanied by a haze of dust blown up by the wind, is not uncommon under the hot sun of tropical plains, but nowhere in the world are these phenomena more constant and discon certing, than on the great flat lands of Iraq. On the other hand such storms of rain as were being experienced, often in the winter convert the plain for a short period into an almost impassable morass, and banish for a time both mirage and dust In the area near Kut-al-Amara the course of the Tigris, a river as wide and deep as is the Thames at West minster, is slightly above the monotonous level of the surrounding country and, in the localities where inconvenient inundations would occur dur ing the season when the stream is in flood, dykes had been thrown up along its banks for the purpose of controlling the water. Where this had been done on one bank only, as was the ca^e with the right bank to the west of Hanna, some command was obtained over the ground on the other bank. Conversely the whole country is so flat that even a small bank defilades much of the surface of the ground behind it; and if a dyke existed on the Turkish bank the area near the river would therefore be dead to direct fire from the British bank and vice versa.149 Both sides endeavoared to overcome this difficulty by using indirect fire controlled either from some of the low mounds which were to be found in places on the banks of the Tigris, or from artificial observing points such as a scaffold, ladder or mast; and to counteract the indirect fire of the British the Turks dug deep well-traversed trenches in the eas^ stoneless soil. Another peculiarity of the area was that the upper por tions of the banks of the Tigris were honeycombed with channels and canals, so constructed that, unless held up by dams, the flood water would be carried from the river on to the neighbouring lands. A series of covered and parallel ways, with depths varying from five to six feet or more near the river to ground level at the end of the channels, were- therefore available for both armies. About a mile from the left bank of the Tigris at Hanna and extending westwards almost parallel with ite course as far as Kut-al-Amara, lay the great Suwaikiya marsh. Like most of these swamps it was shallow and not impassable by men on foot,, although much traffic would soon churn up a heavy mud ; but the marsh was surrounded by a space filled with holding slime, and the water was« liable to be carried to and fro over the plain by the wind. The enemy's position at Hanna extended in a double line of entrench ments across the defile for 1,300 yards between the Tigris and the marsh, the whole front being covered by wire entanglements. Both lines w-ere- then bent backwards on the left so as to face the marsh for a distance of about 2,000 yards, but on the right there was a single line of trench for about a mile and a half along the left bank of the Tigris. Gun em placements in three groups, two each for four guns and one for three guns had been located by the British on the river front, there was an emplacement for four guns on the outer flank of the lines that faced the marsh, and subsequently another was built for a single gun behind the right centre of the fortifications which closed the space between the- marsh and the river. From this information, it might, as had already been pointed out by General Aylmer, be inferred that the enemy were fully prepared not only for some such plan of attack as that which had been drawn up by the British commander, but had also considered the- possibility of an attempt to envelop their left. One of the great advantages possessed by forces which are attacking is this, that until the design of their operations has been unfolded, the defenders cannot be sure to what extent preliminary measures, such as the movement of troops made by the British over the Tigris, are; intended to mislead ; or will be followed by such operations as an advance westwards, or by an attempt to repass the river between Hanna and Fallahiya. It does not appear, however, as if General Aylmer had in mind, on this occasion, any steps definitely calculated to mislead the enemyexcept that the attack would be made along the total frontage between the river and marsh, although only delivered in greatest force\ 150 against the right half of the position. On the other hand their narrow battle frontage would enable the Turks, even if at first they were kept in doubt, rapidly to reinforce any portion of their line that was in peril. The battle, then, if won at all by the British, was to be gained by hard hitting, and tactical methods would be employed for which the enemy were not unprepared ; and although the British possessed the power of subjecting the Turkish positions to fire from two directions, this ad vantage would to some extent be modified both by the topography of the 'battlefield and by the enemy's entrenchments. It is true that battles are rarely gained by subtle manoeuvre that is unbacked by stiff fighting, but victory may be greatly facilitated by dealing either at first, or later in the action, an unexpected and con sequently most telling blow. There was certainly but little scope for manoeuvre in the circumstances in which General Aylmer was placed, l)ut there have been occasions on w r hich commanders have been able to turn to advantage, for the achievement of their purpose, the presence of physical obstacles which appeared to be impassable ; and in this instance the Turks by their dispositions had apparently given a hint that an attack either over the Tigris to the west of Hanna where, as has been stated the left bank is commanded by the right, or across the Suwaikiya marsh, was not altogether out of the question. As regards the former the difficulties of moving boats either up river or overland to suitable points of passage were perhaps insuperable, and a sudden rise in the level of the water, brought about by heavy rainfall, might dis locate such arrangements as had been made to pass troops over the river. In all the fighting that took place before the fall of Kut-al-Amara on the 29th April the British made no attempt to deliver an attack across the Suwaikiya marsh, although, on the 25th February, infantry did move over it for the purpose of demonstrating against the Turkish left at TIanna. The delivery of an attack across the marsh may, therefore, be considered as impracticable, and Aylmer's general plan, perhaps with the addition of a feint of crossing the Suwaikiya, must hold the field. On the 19th January the weather at last cleared, the troops were able to dry their sodden clothes, and the bridge over the Tigris was restored. It was ascertained in the course of an aerial reconnaissance .that entrenchment was in progress at Sannaiyat, but no other informa tion of importance was obtained in regard to the enemy. During the previous night the 35th Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier-General Cr. H. B. Rice, had, in accordance with orders issued by the Tigris Corps, succeeded in advancing 250 yards, and had entrenched under heavy fire in localities about 1,300 yards from the Turkish position, but close (to the line held by their picquets. The 19th Infantry Brigade, ^General Harvey, which had made more ground on the right flank,151 was now from 600 to 900 yards from the enemy's lines, and the 21st Infantry Brigade, General Norie, had occupied the trenches that had been held by the others. The 20th, 28th and 1-1 st Sussex Field Batteries, the 72nd and 77th Howitzer Batteries, the 61st Field Howitzer Battery (less one section) and the two guns of the 104th Heavy Battery, were in position from which to p .uppor t the attack ; and together with the gun boats they had carried out ranging on the enemy's lines. In addition the 9th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Division, now comprising the l-4th Hampshires, the 1st Connaught Eangers, the 62nd Punjabis and the 107th Pioneers, under Major- General K. Gr. Egerton, had been placed under the orders of the com mander of the 7th Division for the coming battle. Meanwhile the troops that were on the right bank under General Keary had been joined, during the night of the 18-19th, by a second squadron of the 33rd Cavalry, the remaining section of the 23rd Moun tain Battery and two companies of the Manchester Regiment; and later on were also reinforced by one section of S. Battery Horse Artillery. In pursuance of General Aylmer's plan of attack, and in order to gain positions from which the enemy's lines could be taken in enfilade, General Keary made a movement westwards on the 19th. Early in the day the two squadrons of the 33rd advanced, with one section of the 23rd Moun tain Battery, in a south-westerly direction to feel for the enemy. At 1000 the bulk of the 9th Infantry Brigade, which had been formed after the battle of Wadi, namely, the 1-1 st and l-9th Gurkhas and one company of the Manchester Eegiment, together with the second sec tion of the 23rd Mountain Battery, the whole being under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel L. W. Y. Campbell, marched towards an Arab village lying about three miles away and on the other side of a loop of the Tigris not far from the Sanna canal, and almost in rear of the Turkish position. At the same time the 93rd were despatched to the top of the loop for the purpose of gaining a position in prolongation of the enemy's front line. The advance of Campbell's force was made with due caution, as it was not known whether the village was or was not held, by the enemy ; and at noon the advanced guard, consisting of two companies of the l-9th Gurkhas and the two guns of the 23rd Mountain Battery, halted about two miles from the place, which could now be dimly distinguished ihrough the haze and mirage away to the north-northwest. No news had been received from our cavalry, although gun and rilie fire had been heard for a short time to the southward, and it now appeared as if Turkish cavalry and infantry were moving near the village. Not the least perplexing consequence of a mirage in Iraq is the fact that it is quite impossible even for the natives of the country to distinguish eithei between men and animals, when seen through i^ disloiting agency152 or between troops of the various arms. Campbell, therefore, decided to be on tlie safe side and deployed for an attack, the l-9tli leading on frontage of 350 yards followed by the two guns. Two companies of the 1-lst moved in echelon behind the left of the l-9th, and he remainder of the 1-lst and the company of the Manchester Begiment marched behind in reserve at a distance of 1,000 yards. No resistance was encountered, although some Arabs were seen to move away from the village as the troops closed on it, and, at 1430 the l-9th reached the place and captured about 150 of the inhabi tants The Gurkhas then passed through the village and gained the right bank of the Tigris, where they found themselves under heavy rifle fire wliicli was promptly returned. Our guns subsequently came into action at a point about 1,600 yards from the river and to the south east of the village. By 1600 the two companies of the 1-lst Gurkhas had moved up and occupied a position to the west of the place, but later on it appeared as if the Turks were still in the loop of the river between the village and the fort. When the company cf the Manches ter's and one of the 1-lst from the reserve had advanced to attack them, it was discovered, however, that these enemy units were on the left not on the right, bank of the Tigris. Eventually three companies ot the 1-lst Gurkhas were placed as outposts to the west of the village, the bulk of the l-9th were to the south of it and this battalion also estab lished touch with the 93rd. After night had fallen the 19th Field Battery and one section of the 61st Howitzer Battery were sent across the river from the left bank, and these were entrenched, together with the guns of the Mountain Battery, in a position from which enfilade fire coul be brought to bear on the first two lines of the enemy's trenches at Hanna. On tlie 19tli General Aylmer bad issued bis final orders for tbe delivery of tbe attack. Under tbese tbe guns tbat were destined to enfilade tbe Turkish lines were to be placed in position on tbe rigbt bank during tbe nigbt. Tbe troops of tbe 7tb Division were to advance and establish themselves close to tbe Turkish trenches, a bombardment to cover their approach being carried out by the batteries on the left bank. T is bombardment, so far as the limited quantity of ammunition wou permit, was to be continued throughout the 20th and nigbt of the ^0 21st; but the infantry on the left bank were to remain in tbe positions that had previously been gained on tbe 20tb, unless a favourable oppor tunity occurred of making more ground. The Cavalry Brigade was meanwhile to be placed by day in observation on the right of the 7th Divisioa, and its guns were to co-operate in the bombardment. These orders were amplified early on the 20tb, when instructions we^e issued that, at 0630 on the 21st (the sun would rise at 0/00) of as soon as there was sufficient light to enable the targets to be distm153 guished, an intense and final bombardment of tlie enemy's first line would be made for two minutes from both banks of the Tigris The artillery would then lift on to the second line, on which an intense fire would be directed for a further period of ten minutes. If the leading troops of the British were more than from 150 to 200 yards from the Turkish trenches at the commencement of the intense fire they must advance to this distance under cover of the bombardment, and the assault must be delivered as soon as the fire of the guns had been litted on to the second line. The principal attack was to be made from the frontage held by the 35th Brigade, which was to be supported by the 9th Brigade, and it was of special importance to capture the bastion situated about 500 yards from the Tigris, and also a small work near the bank of the river and in front of the general line of entrenchments. The general reserve would consist of the 28th Brigade, and this would be placed by 0600 one mile in rear of the five inch howitzers of the 72nd and 77th Batteries, which were behind the British right centre. The Cavalry Brigade was by daybreak to have moved to a position on the extreme right of the army. The troops on the right bank were to assist those on the left by bringing enfilade fire to bear on the Turkish posi tions ; but the two squadrons of the 33rd Cavalry and the two Horse Artillery guns were to advance to the bank of the Tigris and harass the enemy's retirement to the greatest possible extent. The transport was to be ready to march at the shortest notice, and in general all prepara tions were to be made for vigorous pursuit. The headquarters of the Corps would be in the river steamer Medjidieh. There is little comment to be made in regard to the form of these orders, except that they transgress in some respects the salutary regula tion that an operation order should tell the executive commander 4 * no thing that he can or should arrange for himself.... ' If General Young- husband were competent to conduct the attack, he should surely have been competent to allot to the troops entrusted to him the tasks cal culated in his opinion to further the success of the general plan of driv ing in the enemy's right. As it was he was relieved by Aylmer of thi^ duty, and therefore, so far as the allotment of troops would affect the success or failure of the attack, was also relieved of a measure of the responsibility which should have fallen to him. The prolonged telegraphic correspondence between the front and General Headquarters, a disagreeable phenomenon of modern war which seems to have been produced by improved means of communica tion, showed little slackening even on the eve of battle ; for General Aylmer felt constrained to point out to the Commander-in-Chief and to General Townshend that he was far from possessing full liberty of action as between the two banks of the Tigris. A large portion of the bridging material had been destroyed by bad weather, much of what remained l 2was not reliable, and the Tigris Corps, was, lie said, without the means of making good losses. As a result although infantry could be moved from one bank of the river to the other with moderate rapidity, it was a very different story as regards the transfer of cavalry and guns. Sir Fenton Ayimer then stated that, in his opinion, the enemy's object was now to prevent the British from passing through the defile between the Tigris and the Suwaikiya marsh and over the Es Sinn entrenchments ; for if the Turks when in such favourable positions for defence failed to check our troops, it was plainly most improbable that they would be able to resist the combined Tigris Corps and garrison of Kut-al-Amara in the more open ground in the neighbourhood of this town. It was, continued General Ayimer, and apparently with reference to the move ments ^hat had recently been reported by General Townshend, of course possible that, for some reason, the enemy might not desire to offer serious resistance in the defile, and might resolve to fight a decisive action subsequent to the relief of Kut-al-Amara. But, in any case, the dispositions of the troops after this place had been reached, and ponding and even subsequent to the arrival of reinforcements, must be governed by circumstances. He added significantly that, it may be assumed definitely that the 6th Division (holding Kut-al-Amara) will not be the only weak one when we arrive—though the enemy will doubt less lose seriously.' By dawn on the 20th January, the troops of the 7th Division (19th, 21st and 35th Brigades) had gained and fortified a line some 600 or 700 yards from the Turkish trenches ; but the use of the word division does not convey at all an accurate impression of the force that was available. The war establishment of the three infantry brigades of an Indian Divi sion comprised at that time more than 9,000 fighting men. But there were now fewer than 4,000 men in the trenches, after deducting those employed in various duties such as the care of transport, the camp guards, and the men suffering from temporary sickness. The Division, therefore, so called was in reality little stronger as regards infantry than one of its brigades should have been. As a result of this lack of numbers Younghusband had been forced tsmporarily to break up the 21st Infantry Brigade, and to attach the battalions to the other brigades so as to provide something approaching a sufficiency of men with whom to deliver the attack. But the units ^hen comprised in the 19th and 35th Brigades would necessarily lack the cohesion and potential momentum that would be possessed by four strong battalions in each brigade habituated to work in unison. The left half of the British position was, as has been stated, held by the 35th Composite Infantry Brigade, and this was now composed of the l'5th Buffs, the 37th Dogras and 97th Infantry, together with t-he Black Watch, the 6th Jats and the 41st Dogras. On the right was155 the 19tli Composite Infantry Brigade, whicli besides its own battalions included the 9th Bhopals from the 21st Brigade and the 102nd Grenadiers from the 35th Brigade. Behind the left of the 19th Brigade and some 2,000 or 2,500 yards from the enemy's front line were the 72nd and 77th Howitzer Batteries, with the 61st (less one section) in rear of their left. The 20th, 28th and 1-lst Sussex Field Batteries were behind t he 35th Brigade and were also about 2,500 yards from the Turks ; and in rear of the centre of our line and perhaps 3,000 yards from the enemy were the two guns of the 104th Heavy Battery, making up a grand total of 30 guns. During the day the 9 th Infantry Brigade also mo Ted to a position on the bank of the Tigris not far from the artillery which was behind the 35th Brigade ; and the headquarters oi the 7th Division were in a watercourse on the bank of the Tigris behind the 9th Brigade. In accordance with the orders which had been circulated by General Aylmer, Younghusband had, on the 19th, sent out provisional instruc tions for the attack. Under these five bombardments ot the enemy's positions were to be made on the 20th, each lasting lor twenty minutes, and a period of one hour and forty minutes was to elapse between each bombardment. Intermittent firing was also to take place during the night of the 20-21st, but there were, in addition, to be two strong bom bardments each of fifteen minutes duration. Early on the 21st an in tensive bombardment would be made which would be heralded by a salvo from the eighteen pounders, and the subsequent timings of the programme for the artillery would be taken from this salvo. It appears, further, that the fire of the guns was both to be directed on various im portant localities, and was also to be employed in countering that of the Turkish artillery; and that in the whole action about 12,000 rounds were to be expended, a total which was not extravagant having regard to the task before the troops and their numerical weakness, but was probably as large as could in the circumstances be allowed. Orders in greater detail were again issued from the headquarters of the 7th Division at about noon on the 20th. In these it was laid down that the assault of the infantry would commence on the 21st, ten minutes after the artillery salvo, and the fire of the guns would then be directed tor ten more minutes on the enemy's second line, and subsequently on the areas in rear of the second line. The main attack was entrusted to the 35th Brigade, about 1,700 bayonets, and this would be made on the frontage from the bastion lying 500 yards from the river to the salient work standing near the bank of the Tigris, and inclusive of both locali ties. A matter of detail which should have been within the scope oi the responsibility of the Brigadier was then mentioned, and directions were given that prior to the attack a detachment of the company of bombers was to be organised for the purpose of pushing along the trenches to the north of the bastion, and securing the flank of the brigade ; and that a156 second detachment, also of one company, was to be detailed to clear the captured line of trench and make prisoners of all men left in it by the enemy. The attack of the 19th Brigade, which was about 2,000 strong, would be subsidiary to that ot the 35th, and the 19th must hold the enemy to fcheir ground and be prepared to make a thrust home should a favourable opportunity occur. The 9th Infantry Brigade, which could muster about 2,000 bayonets, would support the attack of the 35th Brigade, and was, at 0600 to be in position in certain trenches on the left bank, then occupied by the rearmost portions of the 35th Brigade, and lying about 1,200 yards upstream of the fort which stood on the right bank of the Tigris. By the time that the first bombardment of ten minutes had ended, the assaulting infantry were to be within 150 yards of the enemy's front line of trench ; and the advance to this distance was to have been made under cover of and during the various bombardments. The 128th Pioneers were to be at the headquarters of the Division by 0600 on the 21st. Onecompanyofth's battalion was to be prepared to fill intrenches as they were captured, and to make roadways over them for our guns and transport. Cooked rations for two days were to be carried on the man, and as many as possible in the second line transport; and all transport was to be ready to advance at the shortest notice. Prisoners were to be brought to divisional headquarters, and were to be handed over to the divisional cavalry, the 16th Cavalry. The total frontage that was actually held by the Turks was, as has been stated, about 1,300 yards, and under these orders the main attack was to be made on a frontage of about 500 yards by a force of some 3,700 bayonets, and a subsidiary attack was to be delivered by the 2,000 men that remained. Only one battalion was in reserve, but the Corps reserve, consisting of the 28th Infantry Brigade, about 1,300 fighting men, which was held in hand for the purpose either of exploiting success or repairing failure, was on the left bank and was for practical purposes also the reserve of the Division. It seems from the ten our of the orders given by General Younghusband that it was intended and hoped that the 35th and 9th Infantry Brigades should at once overrun the enemy's first and second lines, and that on their ability to do so would depend the success or failure of the attack. If this was the case it would perhaps have been better to have devoted to this operation a larger proportion of the troops that were available, leaving the four battalions properly belonging to the 19th Brigade, some 1,330 bayonets, to carry out the subsidiary movement; for if a very rapid success were gained against the Turkish right, time would not have been allowed for its reinforcement by such troops from the left as could not be held by the efforts of the 19th Infantry Brigade. Fur ther, in a methodical attack of this kind success is generally either com-157 plete or failure absolute; since it is most difficult m any case to vary arrangements so as to meet new situations after the fighting has com menced, and with the inadequate means of communication that were at the disposal of the 7th Division, it was in all probability hardly practicable to do so. The artillery bombardment, in which the warships joined, duly took place on the 20th, the land guns being supported by those in the Cranefly and Dragonfly. The Turkish guns hardly attempted to reply to our shelling, but at first its effect was not apparent as regards any reduction in the volume of the rifle fire from the enemy's trenches, and whenever our troops endeavoured to gain ground they were met by a storm of bullets. Some advances were, however, made, and it was then ascertained the Turkish riflemen were holding a series of entrench ments in front of their main line. These therefore were bombarded, and as a result the enemy's activities diminished to an appreciable extent. During a reconnaissance by air which was made on the morning of the 20th it was noticed that the Turks were still holding their positions at Hanna, where a gun pit or epaulment had been made behind the centre or right centre of their main line, and 2,000 men had been seen. The entrenchments at Es Sinn on the left bank had been elaborated, but owing to cloud no observation over the ground on the right bank had been possible. Later in the day General Townshend telegraphed that fully 3,000 infantry with guns were moving westwards along the left bank, that other troops were following these, and that a camp which had been observed at the Dujaila canal had disappeared. The receipt of this news caused General Aylmer not unreasonably to infer that, owing to the gun fire of the British, the withdrawal of at any rate a part of the enemy's army might be in progress. But it may be pointed out that the troops might also possibly have been either a division returning after relief at Hanna, or even a large working party that had been employed at the Es Sinn position on the left bank ; or General Townshend might, as so often happened in Mesopotamia, have been misled in his estimate of the numbers of the enemy by the distorting effect of mirage. The British brigades, however, were, as a proper measure of precaution told that steps must be taken so as to ensure that the fact of any retire ment that might be made on the part of the Turk would at once be as certained, and that the force must then be prepared immediately to follow the enemy. But warning was given of the presence of entrench ments which might be held by the Turks at Sannaiyat. The reports that came in on the evening of the 20th from observers on the right bank of the river were to the effect that tents behind the enemy's line were being struck, and that movemeots westwards of. trans port were taking place. Formed bodies had been seen in motion behind158 the Turkish lines in the afternoon, and in the evening a column of trans port which was proceeding eastwards was shelled and forced to turn back. An aerial reconnaissance which was carried out in the afternoon disclosed little that was fresh in regard to the dispositions of the Turks. The weather throughout the day was cool and cloudy, but the surface of the ground was still so soft as to render movement of any kind a matter in volving much exertion and considerable difficulty ; and from this fact, coupled with the trend of the reports as to the nature of the reply that had been made by the Turks to the shelling, it now seemed as if they would accept battle. By nightfall the greater part of the wire protecting the Turkish lioe had apparently been cut by our gun fire, and although the entrenchments were said then to be occupied by the enemy in strength, it is not impos sible that this would have been a more propitious moment for the delivery of the attack than the morning of the 21st January. No change, how ever, was made in the programme. During the night of the 20-21st the bombardment from the left bank was, therefore, continued, and the broops on this bank of the Tigris made some ground. Those on the other bank meanwhile did their best to render assistance by means of gun and rifle fire, and also placed machine guns in positions from which effec tively to enfilade the enemy's trenches on the 21st. Early on the 21st January the British infantry on the left bank of the Tigris were disposed as follows : On the right of the 19th Infantry Brigade, which was now under General Norie, as General Harvey had been seriously wounded on the 20th, was one company of the Seaforth Highlanders entrenched at a distance of about 450 yards from the Turkish line. On their left were the 125th Rifles, and then came the 9th Bhopals and the 102nd Grenadiers, each finding their own supports. One company of the Seaforths was in echelon behind the right , and in the second line were the remainder of the 28th and 92nd Punjabis. The system adopted^ therefore, was in principle to dispose the various forward units in depth, so that each might find its own supports and early mingling of battalions,with its resultant disadvan tages, would be avoided. The 35th Brigade, under General Rice, was drawn up on different principles. On the right and some 400 yards from the enemy's main line were the 41st Dogras, occupying a frontage of 250 yards, and about 100 yards in front of their left and holding the same frontage were the Black Watch ; 130 yards behind the rear of the 41st were the 37th Dogrjio. and the 6th Jats were in support of the Black Watch ; lastly 1,000 yar^s behind was the Brigade reserve, consisting of the l-5th Bufis on the right and the 97th Deccan Infantry on the left. The 9th Infantry Brigade, under General Egerton, had left its bivouac at 0300 and although much delayed by the fact that the159 Tigris, which was rising fast, had flooded one of the trenches or channels on the line of march, the troops had reached the positions two hours later. The rearmost units of the 35th. Brigade did not clear these tren ches until 0600 and the 9th. Brigade then deployed, on a frontage of 600 yards with the 62nd on the right and the l-4th Hampshires extend ing the line to the river ; behind the Hampshires were the Connaught Eangers, and behind these the 107th formed the Brigade reserve. It appears that, in view of the weakness of the battalions of the 35tli Brigade—the Black Watch could muster only some 300 rifles and the 6th Jats only 170—General Rice had issued orders that the battalions in support w^ere to join those in front during the bombardment immediately preceding the assault. The Brigade reserve, which should have closed to within 300 yards of the supports prior to this bombardment, was also to continue the advance while the firing was in progress ; and it was contemplated that the whole of the units of the Brigade would deliver the assault together. This arrangement was communicated to General Egerton, who then issued orders that the 62nd were to move forward, when the shelling began, on a two company frontage into close support of the 35th Brigade, keeping about 350 yards from the Tigris. The l-4th Hampshires were to advance in three lines in echelon behind the left of the 62nd, the leading companies being in line with the rear com panies of the latter battalion ; the Connaught Eangers were to occupy the trenches vacated by the 62nd, and the 107th were to remain in reserve. General Rice joined his Brigade reserve at 0600 and then ordered these battalions to push on, accompanying them for a distance of 500 yards to his advanced headquarters, which had been connected by tele phone with the battalions in front. Owing to the wet soil and to casual ties among the operators, it was found, how T ever, that the forward com munications had now broken down, so that messages could only be sent to or received from the front by runner. The leading battalions, as so frequently happens in battle, were therefore necessarily left largely to their own resources. Owing to morning mist the bombardment from land and river began only at 0745 on the 21st, that is about threequarters of an hour after sunrise, and under its cover the men of the Black Watch gained 200 yards in a couple of so-called rushes forward, although, owing to the clinging mud which was covering the surface of the ground, the pace was that of a slow amble rather than that of a rush. The 41st conformed in this movement in spite of heavy and sustained musketry from the Turkish trenches. When the fire of the British guns lifted ten minutes later to the enemy's second line, the Black Watch drove their advance home followed by the 6th Jats and the 97th and although the leading officer received a bayonet thrust as he reached the position, the bulk1(30 of the Turks had left it before our men could come to hand to hand fight ing, and hurried in disorder to their second line. Consequently only one enemy officer, eight men and two machine guns fell into our hands. JSTot more than 50 of the Black Watch, howevei, gained the Turkish line, and these were joined only by a few officers and men of the 6th Jats, so that, unless some effective impulse came from the remaining troops, the attack had already failed. Meanwhile the assault on the right of the 35th Brigade had met with even less success. All the British officers of the 4:1st were killed or wounded, the 37th were little better off, and owing to the storm of bullets that was directed from the enemy's lines only 25 men of the two Dogra battalions reached the wire entangle ment, which had not been cut so effectively as where the Black Watch had made their attack. Fewer still forced their way through the wire but were soon obliged to fall back. The attack made by the leading units of the 19th Brigade, which was.delivered somewhat later, was quite unsuccessful, and such groups of men as went forward were either shot down or driven back by un ceasing and violent musketry and machine gun fire that came from the Turkish lines. Although all the troops with the exception of two com panies of the Seaforths were subsequently thrown into the fight, no pro gress was made. The 9th Brigade was equally unfortunate. The mud prevented the men from moving faster than a slow walk, and in consequence the 62nd not only lost touch with the 35th Brigade but owing perhaps to the fact that their line had been at right angles to the Tigris swung too far to their right. Here they were exposed to a very strorg fire, all the British officers were put out of action, and the advance came to a stand- 43till. The majority of the l-4:th Hampshires in keeping touch with the 62nd were also brought to a full stop where the attack had failed, instead, as had been the intention, of supporting the troops that were successful; and the Connaught Rangers, who were put into the fight at 0800, could find no cover as all the trenches were filled with dead and wounded, and themselves suffered heavily from the ceaseless musketry and machine gun fire of the Turks. The little party of Black Watch and Jats had, on gaining the enemy's line, at once set about clearing their front by means of bombing and rifle fire, and for this purpose they also turned one of the captured machine guns on the enemy. The Turks, however, were not long in recovering from their panic, and the small British force soon began to be hard pressed by fire from the front and also by bombers on both flanks. It was found to be impossible to open communication with the rest of our force, and the only reinforcements that arrived were half a dozen men of the 97th and one officer and 3 men of the l-4th Hampshires. In the end, therefore, at about 0930 a remnant consisting of 2 officers161 ♦ and 15 men, who had long ago exhausted their small stock of locally made and somewhat defective bombs, succeeded in escaping along the bank of the river to the positions from which they had started earlier in the day ; and here they found that the remainder of the 35th Brigade were being assembled. Owing to the complete breakdown of the means of communication on the left of his division. General Younghusband did not for some time realise what had occurred ; but since, according to reports from the troops on the right bank, progress seemed to have been made by the 35th Brigade, while the right had, he knew, been checked, orders were at 0900 sent to the field batteries to advance for a distance of 1,000 yards, and the headquarters of the division were moved to the point which earlier in the day had been occupied by the headquarters of the 9th Brigade. Half an hour later a report was sent to Aylmer to the effect that it was believed that the men of the 35th Brigade had gained the Turkish trenches and were making progress but that the 19th Bri gade had not been successful; and, at 1000 orders were given that all the guns were to direct their fire on the Turkish right so as to assist the men of the 35th Brigade. Meanwhile General Aylmer had sent instructions for the 28th Infantry Brigade to advance closer to the front. At this juncture it appeared, from movements that were observed by our troops on the right bank, as if a counter-attack might be made against the right of the 35th or the 19th Brigade. General Aylmer con sequently sent instructions for the 28th Brigade (less the 56th Rifles) to move forward to a position from which assistance could, if necessary, be lent to the 19th Brigade which could either meet the enemy's attack directly or take it in flank. At about the same time a message was for warded to Younghusband that the attack was to be prosecuted with energy. But before either of these messages could come to hand. General Younghusband learnt of the failure of the 35th Brigade and of the retire ment # of the remnant from the enemy's position. It seems that Younghusband now formed the opinion that the imme diate renewal of the assault was out of the question, and that time must be given to the units for the purpose of reorganising and preparing for a fresh attempt. At about 1130, therefore, orders were issued that a rapid bombardment of the Turkish line was again to be made at 1250 and that this would be followed by a general attack which would be delivered at 1400 and his decision was communicated both to Aylmer, who meanwhile had made a somewhat similar proposal, and to Keary on the right bank. At about the same time a request was also made that General Aylmer should give orders for the 28th Brigade to deliver an attack. It is never easy to circulate orders during a battle, and as has been pointed out, the means of signal communication at the disposal of the162 Tigris Corps were not of the best. To add to these difficulties raiii now began to fall heavily, and as a result communication except through orderlies practically ceased, and Younghusband's order consequently failed to reach many of the troops in time for effective action. Whether a further effort would, in any case, have been possible on the part of the 35th Brigade is doubtful, for only 600 of its men had been mustered and they had sustained a severe repulse ; but as it was they were soaked to the skin, benumbed with cold and standing in trenches filled with water. The 9th Brigade was in better condition, but apparently the orders for the attack did not come to hand until 1320 and when the units endeavoured to struggle onward through the holding mud, their attempt to do so was quickly crushed by the enemy's fire. Even before the receipt of General Younghusband's order efforts on the part of the 19th Brigade to outflank the Turkish left had come to nothing, as it had been found to be impossible to move forward under the machine gun fire of the Turks over the perfectly fiat plain which was rapidly being converted into a lake. Soon after noon orders had been issued by General Aylmer that two battalions of the 28th Brigade were to support the 19th Brigade. Of these the 51st Sikhs who owing to the state of the ground were only able to drag themselves forward at a slow walk, came up some time after the end of the bombardment. They were in consequence unable to join in the attempt that had been made at 1300 by the 19th Brigade to close with the enemy, and serious casualties were experienced even in gaining the trenches behind the left of the line which was being held by the battalions of the 19th Brigade. The 53rd Sikhs, after marching in line for a distance of 1,200 yards, succeeded in reaching, without much loss, a position behind the centre of the' 19th Brigade ; but here their advance was checked, and they were forced to remain under cover in trenches that were already deep in mud. At about 1330 Younghusband was therefore obliged to report to the headquarters of the Corps that no progress had been made, and Aylmer could only reply that the troops must hold on to their positions. This order w^as passed to the various brigadiers, who were at the same time directed not to commit their men to further attacks. At 1400 General Younghusband despatched another message warning General Aylmer that the infantry units under his command were all deeply involved in action, with the exception of the 107th Pioneers^ and that the only others that had not been engaged were the 2nd Leices tershire and 56th Rifles of the 28th Brigade. From this message it may be inferred that no great hope of victory was even then entertained at the headquarters of the 7th Division, but during the next hour Young husband ascertained definitely that his men were far from being in a condition to renew the attack.163 Meanwhile General Aylmer had sent the Brigadier-General of his General Staff to the 7th Division for the purpose of obtaining particulars of the situation from General Younghusband and this officer arrived a.t the headquarters of the Division at about 1530. In the course of the interview that followed Younghusband expressed the opinion that, owing to the heavy casualties which had been experienced, to the intermingling of the units, and to the physical condition of the troops, who were exhausted by the strain of battle and by the rain and cold, it was not advisable even to hold such ground as had been gained ; he also stated that another attack should not be undertaken until the weather had improved. Some words that were spoken during the conference were apparently construed by General Younghusband as conveying the approval of Sir Fenton Aylmer for a withdrawal. Orders were issued, in consequence, by the staff of the 7th Division that, at nightfall, the guns were to move back to their original positions. At the same time the infantry were to retire to the entrenchments lying some 1,300 yards from the Turkish positions, the 19th Brigade holding the right half and the 9th Brigade the left half of the line. The 28th Brigade would form in rear of the 19th, and the 35th Brigade behind the 9th Brigade. These orders were first despatched by the Signal Service but duplicates were then sent to the brigades by staff officers, who were authorised to explain to the brigadiers what was required. General Aylmer, however, was very far from desiring or approving of any withdrawal, and, at 1635 he sent out the following appeal to the troops : ' For the honour of the Empire and for the sake of your brave comrades in Kut, I ask the gallant troops under my orders to hold on to their present position and to make one more supreme effort to capture the enemy's line.' An hour later orders were circulated from the headquarters of the Tigris Corps that a further attempt to break through the Turkish lines must be made on the 22nd. The troops must hold and strengthen their positions in the interval. The 9th and 28th Infantry Brigades were both placed at the disposal of the commander of the 7th Division, who was to make the best dispositions that were possible for the renewal of the attack in the afternoon. Arrangements, it was added, were being made for the further bombardment of the Hanna lines by our artillery. These two messages were duly handed by the staff of Sir George lounghusband to the Signal Service of the 7th Division for communica tion to the troops ; but, at 1900 Younghusband was obliged to report to Aylmer that the rain had severed all means of communication by signal and that it was doubtful whether the later orders had been received by the units in time to prevent the withdrawal. Plans for the 22nd must therefore be based on the supposition that the British had moved back to positions some 1,300 yards from the Turkish front.164 As no further news had reached the headquarters of the Corps, mean while, General Aylmer sent a message at 2035 to Younghusband, which was received half an hour later, to the effect that if the orders issued by the 7th Division had been carried out the troops must, for the night, remain in the positions to which they had withdrawn. If the orders had not been carried out the troops were to hold fast to the ground that had been gained. A report was forthwith to be made as to the action that had been taken. To this telegram Younghusband replied that to withdraw had seemed to be the only practicable course in view of the condition of the troops and the state of the weather. The brigades had, he said, been ordered to communicate with the headquarters of the divi sion, and to reorganise in positions that were as far forward as possible. He continued : ' Am now in communication with 9th, 19th and 28th Brigades and hope shortly to relocate 35th Brigade Country is now a swamp and all movement exceedingly slow. Casualties not yet as certained but believed to be heavy especially in officers, troops much scattered and mixed owing to repeated attacks. Collection and reorga nisation at night and this weather correspondingly difficult. We are doing our best.' At about 2200 General Younghusband sent one of his few remain ing staff officers—the others were still on their rounds with his earlier orders—to ascertain the dispositions, strengths and condition of the battalions. Although the distances to be covered were not great this officer did not return until 0300 when he reported the morale of the men was good, but the brigadiers were unanimous that a further offensive on the 22nd by the troops that had been closely engaged on the 21st was out of the question. There was very little firing during the night for the torrential rain had put an end to the battle. Covered by the Seaforths, 53rd, 107th and Connaught Rangers, the British therefore were able to withdraw and reorganise at leisure, and many wounded and much equipment were collected and brought in. It was, however, a miserable experience and when not on the move officers and men stood, sat or lay down in water, while rain or sleet driven on by an icy wind pelted down without ceasing. Yet by daylight the 7th Division had to some extent already been reorganised. Early on the 22nd January the 19th Composite Brigade had in the front line from right to left the Seaforths, 28th and 92nd, and the 9th Bhopals and the 102nd were in support; the 28th Brigade, with which were the 128th Pioneers, was standing in rear of the 19th. Of the 9th Infantry Brigade, which was on the left of the 19th, the 107th and Connaught Rangers were in the first line, then came the l/4:th Hamp- shires and the 62nd were with the 28th Brigade behind the Hampshires. The 35th Composite Brigade, however, was still being165 assembled behind the others. The fighting strength, in the line, of the ; four battalions of the 19th Infantry Brigade was only 13 British officers, 12 Indian officers, and 829 non-commissioned officers and men ; that of the units of the 21st Brigade was 9 British officers, 20 Indian officers and 627 non-commissioned officers and men. The 9th Infantry Brigade could muster only 32 British officers, 18 Indian officers and 1,037 non-commis sioned officers and men, and the 28th Brigade less than 1,000 of all ranks. While these events had been taking place on the left bank, the troops on the opposite side of the Tigris had carried out their due part in the action. Soon after 0900 on the 21st January a message was received from the headquarters of the Tigris Corps that an attack along the right- bank might be made by a number of Arabs ; but our two squadrons only gained contact with a body of some 300. The Tigris, as has been stated,, had for two or three days been rising steadily; and at about 1100 these squadrons of the 33rd Cavalry and the section of Horse Artillery which had been sent westwards to a position from which to harass the enemy's troops as they retired, found themselves in danger of being cut of by a wide stream which began to flow southwards from the river. They were obliged, therefore, to fall back. Soon after 1300 the camp oppo site to the Wadi was flooded and had to be moved a short distance away from the bridge. By evening the surface of the country was in such a state as to limit the rate of movement of a man on foot to one mile per hour ; and it was with great difficulty that the bulk of the troops were able to occupy a line across the bend of the river from the Arab village to the fort, while the two squadrons of the 33rd and one company of the Manchester Regiment undertook the security of the camp. Early on the 22nd Younghusband made a personal report on the situation to General Aylmer, and, in consequence, the latter decided at 1000 when the rainfall had fortunately ceased, to send a flag of truce to the enemy, and to ask for a cessation of hostilities for the pur pose of collecting the wounded and burying the dead, as the casualties of the British had amounted to about 2,700. Although the Turks did not officially agree to this truce until some time afterwards, the flag had no sooner been hoisted in our lines than a number of Arabs swarmed out of the enemy's positions, and began both to rob the disabled and dead and to collect rifles. Officers and men therefore advanced unarm ed from our trenches to protect their comrades, but were themselves in more than one instance assaulted and robbed by the Arabs. Before the armistice had been arranged the Turks, it appears, also re moved those of the disabled who had fallen close to their trenches ; but although many British units were not informed until late in the day that a suspension of arms was in progress, the remainder of the wounded were duly collected and brought into the British lines.166 While this work was in progress instructions had been circulated by General Aylmer to meet the immediate situation. The ground that was held by the British was now to be divided into three areas : a for ward or 'A' area on the left bank, in which there would be a force of three infantry brigades, and in addition all the guns except those on the right bank and those of the Horse Artillery ; u B ' area, a rest camp on the left bank of the Tigris above the Wadi, where tents would be pitched for the troops and the whole of the second line transport would be placed ; and u C ' area below the mouth of the Wadi which was to be occupied by all troops on the right bank, except those holding the position that lay opposite to area A. Areas A and B would be garrisoned alternately for periods of 72 hours, first by the 19th, 21st and 35th Infantry Brigades and the 107th Pioneers, the whole being under the commander of the 7th Division ; these units would be relieved by the 8th, 9th and 28th Infantry Brigades (the first of which was to comprise the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment, the 1st Battalion Highland Light Infantry which had now arrived at the front by steamer, and two companies of the 2nd Rajput Light Infantry) and the 128th Pioneers. The troops on the right bank would be under the commander of the 7th Infantry Brigade ; the Provisional Battalion, composed of drafts for units in Kut-al-Amara, would secure the left bank of the Tigris in the area below the Wadi; and all the steamers and mahailas (barges) that were employed in bring ing supplies to the troops on the left bank were to close up to B area, while those serving the units on the right bank were to lie off C area. General Aylmer had already telegraphed a summary of the situation and a description of the weather, at 0110 on the 22nd January, both to General Headquarters and to Townshend, and had ended the telegram with the sentence :* 'I am forced to abandon my intention re attacking enemy's position to-morrow, as troops in front line have been withdrawn without my orders to vicinity of entrenched position occupied by them two days ago, about 1,300 yards from enemy's trenches. They are greatly disorganised owing to unsuccessful attempt to storm enemy's position, making it utterly impossible to send them back again at present.' When the redistribution of the force was being arranged Aylmer again telegraphed, at 1020 on the 22nd, both to Basra and to Kut- al-Amara the depressing news of the result of the battle in the following terms :* ££ I regret that there is no doubt that in attempting to assault the enemy's position yesterday we have suffered a severe reverse in spite of the greatest gallantry of troops, and our losses have been very heavy. The troops on retiring removed as many wounded as possible but many * These telegrams are quoted in ' My Campaign in Mesopotamia. ,, Major-General Sir C . Townshend. ■1167 jmust still remain near the enemy's trenches. I am sending a request to the Turks for six hours armistice to bury dead and bring away wound ed. For the present I shall hold the line about 1,200 yards in front of the enemy's position and a reserve line behind. The troops' condition may be regarded as prohibiting further advance for the present. My proposals will follow on receipt of further information of extent of :reverse. Weather is atrocious and floods increasing.' The ordeal of battle throws a breaking strain on every nerve and faculty, and this is the reason why errors must be expected in carrying ^out even the most straightforward manoeuvre. It was also probably :for this reason that Napoleon declared that a commander should not •accept battle unless he considered the odds to be 7 to 2 in his favour, or in other words that a wide margin must be allowed for such mistakes and faults of commission and omission as would inevitably occur during the contest. The odds certainly were by no means 7 to 2 in favour of the Tigris 'C^orps on the 21st January. The enemy, as it turned out, had made good use of the delay in the advance of the British caused by the gales and rain, and were very well protected ; the trenches in the front line being from 6 to 7 feet deep, and in addition there were loopholed para pets and well built parados. Deep communication trenches, with many traverses, also connected the front with the second line. Against such oover the comparatively feeble bombardments that could be delivered by the British were unlikely to prove effective, and as a result the troops may be said to have attempted with equal numbers (the British apparent ly were opposed by the combined 35th and 38th Divisions, two battalions ■of the 51st Division, and the whole of the 52nd Division, totalling pro bably 9,000 infantry with 26 guns) to evict an almost unshaken and re solute enemy from a most formidable position. This was a task hardly within human power ; and it is, therefore, not probable that a decisive success would have been gained had the weather been less inclement, and the state of the ground such as to enable rapid movement to be made ; and had such minor errors of execution as the loss of direction on the part of the 9th Infantry Brigade been avoided. If the odds were indeed so little in favour of the troops under General Aylmer, the question must inevitably arise as to whether the battle , should have been fought. There are of course, occasions on wnich battle must be offered or accepted whatever the chances of success, and a commander who hesitated to engage until his prospects of success were as favourable as those mentioned by Napoleon might never find himseif m a position to make the great venture. This, however, was in actual fact not an occasion when it was vital to risk everything in the hope .that same weak point might unexpectedly be found in the enemy's situa- .tion. And had Sir John Nixon been aware of what is now patent in mregard to the quality of the Turkish troops, the formidable nature of the enemy's position, and the powers of resistance that were still poss essed by the garrison of Kut-al-Amara,* it may safely be conjectured that he would not have urged his subordinate to deliver an immediate attack. But Sir John did not possess this knowledge, and as is usual m war was obliged to base vital decisions on inaccurate premises., It haa been pointed out that he was also in bad health, and actually toe was invalided on the 18th January and replaced by Lieutenant- general Sir Percy Lake, the Chief of the General Staff in India. * The place surrendered only on the 29tli April.CHAPTER XII. Some notes on the operations of January 1916. The battles of Shaikh Saad (6th to 9th Jan.) Wadi (13th Jan.) and the first Hanna (21st Jan.) are discussed in the accounts ffiven bv Gen. Bird. As a result of visits to the scenes of these actions and of conferences on the ground, many further points of interest were discussed. A few of these are touched upon below. (A.) In the first place, at the end of December, Gen. Nixon had three courses open to him (а) To advance at once as he did. (б) To concentrate his force before attempting' a forward move. (e) To compromise between (a) and (6) and advance on the latest possible date compatible with the certainty of relieving Kut. The main points in favour of delaying the advance were (1) The further the Turks could be drawn down the river the longer their L. of C. and the greater their difficulties of supply^ with corresponding advantage for us. (2) It gave Gen. Nixon time to concentrate a sufficient force to enable him to attack the Turks with possibly a slight superiority in numbers, although the estimates regarding the relative strength of the opposing forces were somewhat conflicting^ Eeinforcements were arriving piecemeal, and it was evident that they could not be pushed straight on to the front as fully organised and equipped formations, nor could they be adequately supplied. (3) Success depended largely on reducing the chaotic sta^e of the L. of C. to a semblance of order. The longer the time avail able the greater chance there was of reorganizing the transpoit and administration, the personnel, and also the supply arrange ments. (4) After an urgent appeal for rapid relief at the end of December, Gen. Townshend had now told Gen. Nixon that he would not ask for help except in the case of emergency. Kut, as far as was then known, had rations until the end of February. (5) The outstanding deficiency in transport and the certainty of increased difficulty under weather conditions shortlv to be expected. (6) There was the hope of Eussian co-operation, given time, ♦ ( 169 ) M 2170 Tne factors in favour of immediate advance were— ' ■ L ) Kirfc might be overwhelmed, although this was unlikely in view of the set-back the Turks had experienced during Xmas 1915, and their subsequent passivity. (2) Bad weather was approaching. (3) Pressure from home, reinforced by the fact of the Gallipoli evacuation. (4) .Fears of Kut supplies running short. Expenditure of ammunition on the scale that had been necessary to beat off the Christmas attacks would rapidly exhaust the reserves available. With regard to rations, it must be remembered that at this time it was understood that Gen. Townshend only had enough to carry him on till February. No definite reply had yet been received to Gen. Alymer's direct request on 30th Decem ber for an exact date by which Kut must be relieved. (5) Threats of fresh Turkish reinforcements. A fresh division was arriving and two more were believed to be en route. It may be agreed, that although it was extremely difficult for Gen. Nixon to act otherwise than as he did, especially in view of the moral appeal of the beleagured garrison, it would have been better had he defer red his offensive, and made a methodical advance. Before advancing he might have occupied Shaikh Saad in order to relieve the pressure on the besieged garrison. As it was, Gen. Nixon's advance was too hurried and the following factors contributed to the failure that ensued (1) Lndue optimism of the G.O.C. and his Staff and under estimation of the Turkish fighting efficiency. The latter factor is most apparent in all correspondence from Force H. Q. during the ensuing period. The G. 0. C. always seemed to expect that the Turks would bolt if any pressure were put upon them. I his, doubtless, was the result of 1915 experiences when, up to Ctesiphon, our troops had only had to deal with Divisions largely consisting of Arabs. They were now faced by Osmanlis. Excellent material, well organized and led. Many of them veterans and flushed with their success in turning us out of Gallipoli. (2) No high authority was sent up to the battle front to discover the actual situation of the relieving force. {3) Gen. Townshend was not pressed to report accurately what s^ actual supply situation was, or how long he could last out; nor was he put directly under the orders of Gen. Aylmer to ensure co-operation.171 With regard to tactical details of the ensuing battles. (B.) Shaikh Saad :— {a) Staffs of VII Divn. arrived at Ali Gharbi Jan. 4th. but in many cases were not allowed to take over, e.g., G.S. employed for Liaison—Brigadier and Staff 19th Bde. employed with the composite Bde., not with the 19th Bde. {Note. —Gen. Bird says that the Staff of the YII Div. did not arrive till Jan. 11th.] (6) Employment of Reserves.—First employed on right bank, transferred to left as soon as bridge of boats was completed, sent out to right flank to meet possible Turkish counter attack. Sent by night march downstream to attack Turkish Force reported to have got below us on Tigris—never engaged —did not influence the fight. (c) The hurried attack forced upon Gen. Aylmer by Gen. Young- husband accentuates— (1) Poor information owing to lack of reconnaissance. (2) Absence of artillery support—no time for registration. (C.)—The Wadi, 13th January 1916. The orders and certain other data are given at the end of this chapter. (а) The slowness of the advance from the position of deployment. This was reached at midnight. The advance should have been continued at 0630, but actually did not begin till 0730. Reached the Wadi at 0930, and practically no opposition was met with till about 1100. Mist is given as one reason. This should have favoured the at tack. As soon as the mist cleared it was obviously essential to push on with the greatest speed to prevent the enemy, on information from Arabs, moving troops to oppose us. (б) The advance from the position of deployment would have beeni better with the right Bde. forward instead of the left, i.e., wirJi a view to envelopment. (c) The delay whilst the artillery crossed over the Wadi was not necessary. Our guns could have supported the 35th and 19th Bdes. from the south bank of the Wadi. (d) When the 19th Bde. was ordered to prolong the right of 21st Bde., a Staff Officer could not find the 21st Bde- but found Turkish Cav. Gen. Harvey decided to go for this as it must be the enemy left. A gap of approximately one Bde. front was thus created between 21st &amp; 19th Bdes.172 (e) Failure of Cav. to support 19tli Bde. attack. When slightly shelled and under long range fire of a few M. 6s.—they retired. f J he inertness of the Cavalry throughout the day is of interest. They had a magnificent opportunity of cutting off the whole Turkish force N. of the Wadi by a mounted advance of some 3 miles over perfect going. Movements of Turks were visible, i.e., they could see their objective. Opposition, especially in the morning, was very slight. Compare action of Cav. in Palestine, at Hujj or El Mughar. CO 35th Bde. asked by Gen. Harvey (19th Bde.) to press attack with him through to the Tigris. This was possible and would have cut off the whole Turkish force. 35th Bde. decided to interpret literally Div. Order (i.e. only to prolong 19th Bde. right). Turkish Force on this part of battlefield small and not entrenched. {9) A determined offensive by two brigades and a Cavalry brigade must have succeeded. (D.) First Battle of Hanna, Jan. 21st. [a) Troops before attack were handicapped by cold and bad weather, exposure and unremitting night-work pushing our trench line forward with heavy casualties nightly. Rations were bad and there was little fuel with which to cook. Troops were constantly wet, and had little cover. (5) After the battle of Hanna morale reached its lowest ebb owing to lack of confidence in leadership, bad weather, heavy casualties especially in British officers, and insufficient rations. (c) On Jan. 14th, Gen. Aylmer wrote to all Brigadiers asking them for an appreciation and plan for the relief of Kut. They were to pass this on to selected C. Os. in their Bdes. (d) The outstanding feature of the battle is the resolution of the infantry, plodding through knee-deep water and mud under a sheet of grazing S. A. fire from invisible Turkish trenches. The inadequacy of the covering fire was not only on account of the paucity of guns, the lack of H. E., and the impossib ility of accurate registration and observation, but also to the failure of commanders at this period to realize the weight and organization of fire required to deal with modern rifles in trenches.

Aylmer were :— (1) Action North of the Suwaikiya Marsh. (2) Assault on the Hanna position. i (3) Action on the right bank. At this time it must be remembered that the weather was at its worst. The river was in flood, the bridges only kept open with difficulty, the country an immense bog, the troops constantly wet and chilled. We had suffered over 8,000 casualties in three weeks without obtain ing results of great value. There was also a considerable amount of sickness. The hardships ^and exposure of the troops and the painful failure of the arrangements :for wounded must have affected morale to some extent. The ration situation was causing great anxiety, the reserves at the iront having fallen dangerously low though all the water transport available was already strained to the utmost. The 13th British Division was on the seas, but could not be ex pected till March. Taking the three alternatives suggested in turn :— Firstly. —Action across the Suwaikiya area was only possible with ^difficulty for infantry, consequently troops would have to operate north of the marsh. This would involve a march of 25 miles, which would end in the vicinity of Suwada and would take 2 days rendering surprise impossible. Drinking water would have had to be carried. On arrival troops would find themselves opposed by the Turkish reserve from Shumran and detachments from Hanna and Sinn totalling perhaps 10,000 men. It w T ould hardly be advisable to undertake such an operation with less than 5 Brigades, as units were much under strength. For this force- transport for three days could with great difficulty be provided leaving :no reserve of transport at all. Secondly. —An attack on Hanna. This would involve a frontal attack on a strongly entrenched posi tion at which we had already decisively failed. It was now held by the pick of the Turkish troops. Even if this position were captured, equally strong positions at Sannaiyat and Es Sinn would be in front of us still. There would be no possiblity of the employment of the Cavalry Brigade. The Turkish position could be enfiladed from the right bank, but the shortage of H. E. and medium artillery would make it unlikely thai such enfilade fire would be effective. There was insufficient artillery to smash the Turkish defences. In fact there was practically no artil'ery *of natures suitable for such work. On the other hand the supply arrangements would be simple.174 Were it possible to combine an attack on Ha una with a crossing further upstream behind the Turkish trenches, a decisive victory might be gained. That something of this kind was in Gen. Aylmer's mind may be seen bv forwa rd move of the 3rd Division on February 22nd. This advance came as a complete surprise to the Turks, whose camps on the north bank were shelled at close range on our occupation at dawn of the Sandy Kidre bend, 4 miles m rear of Hanna. Unfortunately only a feint with ummy pontoons was possible as there was no transport for the real pontoons. Thirdly.—Action on the right bank against the Sinn position. This- position would probably be only lightly held, and there was a distinct possibility of surprise. The Turkish defences in this sector lacked depth, and success here- would be likely to lead to decisive results (as a glance at the map will. Bilow). But owing to shortage of land transport the question of supply- would be difficult. 11 ^ Such a move would put us at once within sight of Kut and in direct: touch with its garrison. The possible co-operation of that garrison is eat wit in Chap. XVII. Here it is only necessary to mention the advisability of placing Gen. Townshend under direct command of Gen Aylmer. It seems then that:— {a) Action north of the Suwaikiya marsh must be ruled out. (6) The assault of the Hanna position would be feasible but a very- difficult and costly operation. (c) Crossing of the river behind that position was impracticable,. for lack of a mobile Bridging Train. {d)The plan actually adopted promised the best prospects of success.. Information available to Corps Comman ^On the 9th air reconnaissance was impossible as the weather was- atrocious. On the 10th air reconnaissance was still impossible. Arabs reported that the Turks had retired, beyond Wadi and Ora. The force on the right bank left Ora at dawn on the 9th. The force on the left bank reached Man, east of Sannaiyat and South of the Suwaikiya. Marsi. liie 6th Division reported movements back from Es Sinn On the 11th reports showed that the Wadi was held; 11,GG0 mem were on the left bank (probably the remains of the 52nd, 35th and S8tlb i-vs.) with Cavalry. Es Smn appeared to be empty at neon. SCO men were seen at Abu Rumraan.

For a detailed study of the battle of Dujaiia the student is referred! to Major-General Sir W. I). Bird's book ' A Chapter of Misfortunes.' The battle is an interesting one. Not only tactically, and in its bold conception and plan for attacking an entrenched position from a distance of 10 miles, but also in that it was really the decisive action relative- to the fall of Kut. It thereby involved a chain of consequences which led to strategic decisions of great importance; necessitating the- employment in this theatre of war of a force whose eventual ration, strength was little under half a million. It seems that an initial mistake, which was to have a profound effect on the operations, was made here. Points to be noted are the splitting ^ . up of formations ; centralized control ol very wide- Organization. j . 1 . _ J spread movements with most inadequate means of communication, and the extremely detailed nature of the orders which apparently had a paralysing effect on some of the subordinate commanders. The force for the decisive operations (Columns ' A J and ' B J ) consis ted of brigades from three different formations, who had never worked together before. Moreover, the 37th Brigade whose function was to co operate from the east (Column 4 B ') was not placed under Major- General Kemball's orders for the attack. The Commander of this force was not known to his troops nor were^ his staff ; the latter were hastily collected with no previous experi ence of working together and with very little time for preparation. The selection of General Kemball may have been influenced by his . previous knowledge of the country. The qualities ot dash and vigour in the attack which he had shown at Shaikh Saad and the Wadi were^ just those required for the contemplated operation. Yet, unless the personal factor was overwhelming, it is difficult to understand why the- 3rd Division was not used for the decisive attack. No splitting up of formations would then have been necessary. This was a well-tried Division with a year's experience of fighting in France, with its own artillery, and fully organized and staffed. One further point in organization. It is suggested that the whole of tLis force (9th, 28th, 36th and 37th- Infantry Brigades, with necessary E. A., R. E., etc.) to which was en trusted the operation on which success or failure depended, should have been put under one Commander with an augmented Divisional Staff.. ( ISO )181 Further, if it had still been considered desirable definitely to differen tiate the functions of Columns A' and ' B,' a separate Commander and Staff should also have been appointed in addition to command the three Brigades of the latter Column. It is very difficult for a Brigadier to command a column of two Brigades as well as his own Brigade. Whether the Cavalry Brigade should also have been put under the orders of the Commander of this whole force is a more open question, but it is considered that it would have been advisable. In view of the impossiblity of careful previous reconnaissance, except Night march. t0 a Very llmite f extent by air, and the extra ordinary difficulties inherent in such an operation, the march was astonishingly successful. The peculiar difficulties of the previous concentration and the for- mmg-up of the troops were overcome satisfactorily, and all arrangements- made seem to have worked well. The formation adopted appears on examination to have been suitable. Concentration was essential: and marauding Arab bands had to be- guarded against. A few further details to note are :— (i) The very late arrival of Corps Orders, and the fact that Column- Orders were only issued when the troops were actually mov ing to the rendezvous. This may have been immaterial if details had been settled primarily at Conferences, as was pro bably the case. The late arrival of the Orders is strange, as they are timed 1400 March 3rd. It should be noted that these Orders were, in fact, modified in many details at Con ferences prior to the operations. A later Corps Order (No. 26). was issued apparently on March 6th, but it is not certain that this was actually received by all the troops concerned. (u) Position of H. Q. of formations. Those with their signals and liaison officers are quite big enough to form a small column of their own on the directing flank of each formation. It is a nuisance having all the animals there, but it is the best place for the G. 0. C., B.M. and Liaison Officers. (iu) Position of guides—(20 yards ahead of flank column on directing flank). 2 assistants at least are required. (iv) Importance of having infantry (and no other arm except pos sibly sappers) on both flanks continuously. The only arm that can be depended on to keep distance and' c ressing. Infantry on the flanks of guns or transport must be mside ' the formation. (v) Scout pairs are not efficient as protection in front. It is essen tial to smother all opposition at once. For this more than- 2 bayonets are required. Platoons are a convenient ske • sections often on the small side.^(vi) Importance of keeping columns short and advantages of moving on a wide front. This was done ; but it is possible that even wider fronts might have been employed and the Columns shortened still more. There is probably no longer any question that the failure to take Dujaila, and thus the failure to achieve the hoped Action^KembaH's f or resu lts, was due to the extraordinary delay which occurred in the launch of Gen. Kemball's -attack and the slowness with which that attack developed. Complete surprise was attained. The few Turks in the redoubt were seen by our troops standing on the parapet shaking out their blankets- Prisoner's statements and Major Leachman's personal reconnaissance (he entered the redoubt himself, disguised as an Arab, about sunrise .and returned to report that there was a garrison of about 40) are -confirmed by Turkish accounts. There were not more than 200 men in and around Dujaila when Columns 4 A 5 and 4 B ' halted in the bend of the Depression. It appears that after leaving the Corps position of deployment (Point ' X ' about 4 miles east of the Dujaila Redoubt) Kemball's force was halted for nearly an hour whilst certain rearrangements were made. It would seem that the Column Commander was not satisfied with the iormation, should resistance be met with in the dark. It is unfortuante that he did not either communicate his objections at the Conference on the preceding day, or else carry out the rearrangements before leaving the original Position of Assembly. It was evident to all ranks that speed was the crux of the matter. ~Yet after reaching unobserved the bend in Dujaila Depression (2 miles south south-west of the Redoubt) three precious hours were wasted before a move forward took place. Not only this, but the artillery were moved out and allowed to register in a leisurely manner, thus abandoning the surprise attained. When the advance did begin the 36th Brigade seems to have moved across the front of the 9th and 28th. It seems to have had an indefinite objective, and whilst its initial impetus was frittered away, later, it suffered from the inevitable consequences of having to move to a flank within effective rifle range of the enemy. There is some difficulty in grasping clearly the orders which the other two Brigades were given for the attack. Their progress was disappoint ing and further movements on that day are confusing. In these attacks, unlike most of those in Mesopotamia, the infantry were able to see their objective. Dujaila Hill is about 200 yards long (N. &amp; S.) and 50 yards wide (E. &amp; W.) and stands up most conspicuously.D ujaila M ound (Photo 11)23 ). T he T igris, with M ahelas (to face page 4 Chap. XIII.)183 Moreover the success of tlie 8tli Brigade in actually reaching the he ■ doubt from the east in the evening under more difficult conditions emphasises this point. By the time this brigade attacked (1600) the Turks were in full strength, and the Eedoubt very strongly manned. The attack was delivered over 3,000 yards of perfectly flat open ground with the sun low in the eyes of the attackers and behind the backs of the defenders. It was delivered on the long face of the Redoubt, where there were 3 to 4 lines of fire 200 yards in length, and had to cross directly the Dujaiia Depression down which enfilade artillery and M. G. fire had beea well organised by the Turks from the right (North) flank. But the attack was properly formed up and launched, every man knew the objective, and no halting was allowed ; the method of continuous advance in great depth was adopted. The result was that in spite of the enormous concentration of fire the Turks were able to bring to bear upon them 8th Brigade stormed the Eedoubt and actually seized the crest of the hill. They had lost nearly 50 per cent.in the effort however and being unsupported, were turned out by an immediate counter-attack of fresh Turkish troops from behind the hill. To return to General Kemball's morning attack. Had the attack been made by two of his Brigades in line, with one in reserve and been launched even as late as 0800, there can be little doubt it would have succeeded. There was no great danger to be apprehended from the left flank. The cavalry were operating in this direction, and with one infantry brigade in hand, a single battalion at most would have been ample precaution here It is doubtful if any of Kemball's Force got within 800 yards oi the Redoubt. Yet their casualties during the day were 24 per cent. This illustrates the effect on troops advancing by rushes of undisturbed rifle fire from trenches. Further confirmation of the weakness of the Redoubt garrison can be found in the records of the 37th Infantry Brigade. The role of this formation was to take up a position with M. Gs. on some low sandy hillocks about 2,000 yards due east of Dujaiia and co-operate by fire with Column B's attack on the Redoubt. The posi tion was reached about 0600 and the Infantry of the Brigade proceeded to dig in undisturbed about 800 yards closer to the enemy {i .e., afc a range of 1,200 yards). So palpably empty was the Redoubt that they asked permission to push on and seize the Redoubt themselves Presumably in view of the explicit detailed orders laid down and the lack of communication to higher autnority, this permis sion was withheld. Turk reinforcements were seen to arrive at Hhe Redoubt and file into the trenches from about 0900 onwards N184 All Artillery were permitted to go into action and register deliberately.. Artillery ^ further surprise was thus done awa,y with, and the Turk reserves at Maqasis at once started towards the sound of the guns, at the double. Guns were not used in close support where they would have been most useful, especially against the machine guns which it was impossible to locate or to deal with from the battery positions. Fire on Dujaila Hill was accurate and effective but was concentrated on the top of the hill, whereas the enemy fire which was most effective, was from trenches at the foot of the slopes and out in the plain ahead. The Cavalry may be said to have exercised no effect on the battle. Cavalry They hovered about in an ineffiective. way on the left, usually somewhat in rear of the infantry, and always moving either with great deliberation or not at all. It is interesting to conjecture what would have been the result had they been capably led, and either— (а) been given the independent mission of sweeping wide round the flank between Dujaila and the Hai and operating against the enemy's reinforcements hurrying up from Maqasis, or (б) been placed under General Kemball's orders and pushed on. by him before daylight (from the Corps position of deploy ment) in a wide sweep round to Imam-al-Mansur and thence- to threaten the enemy's rear. The inaction of the Kut garrison is considered in Chapter XVII. Ifc would seem that a single Squadron of D. H. 9's or similar aircraft Aircraft acting against the Turkish reserves, might have been decisive, had they been available. To sum up, the following plan is suggested. It aims at, not only — + i h ir tlle relief 0 - - Kut ' tlle destruction of the ai Turkish forces on the right bank of the Tigris (1) A frontal attack by the 28th and 37th Infantry Brigades to dis&gt; tract enemy (on same lines as for Column 4 C'). (2) The following troops under G. 0. C. 3rd Division to carry out the main operations, i .e.,— (а) Capture the Dujaila position ; (б) Attack and capture Sinn Abtar from the South ; (c) Seize Imam-al-Mansur and attack enemy's reserves at Maqasig. Troops Cavalry Brigade, 3rd Division.. One Infantry Brigade attached and all available Artillery. Additional Staff Officers as could be spared to be attached. The attack on Dujaila to be launched as soon as there was light bo see, and from a southerly direction, or from as far south as possible.185 It is considered that one brigade, attacking at dawn, and closely supported by the artillery would have taken this position. 0. should then have been established, guns brought up, and fire opened on the Sinn Abtar position, in enfilade. Meanwhile, supported by one Brigade of Infantry (to move after the capture of Dujaila) the Cavalry Brigade to ride wide round Dujaila, seize Iman-al-Mansur and operate against the enemy reserves about Maqasis. As soon as ready, an attack to be launched on Sinn Abtar, on a one Brigade front, astride the Sinn Abtar-Dujaila Switch, one Brigade being held in reserve, Dujaila put in a state of defence, and the Brigade which had attacked it reorganized. It is considered that the Kut garrison might have played an important part in these operations, even had they failed to cross the Tigris.

Some notes on the Turkish Defences, Dujaila-Sinn Position, (These notes were made in the hot weather of 1916, when there was ample opportunity to examine this position at leisure, by an Officer who had taken part in the operations in March 1916). The Turkish problem here was to prevent any approach to Kutr on the right bank of the Tigris. The Turks were handicapped by shortage of transport and difficulties of supply in so long a line. Moreover water was unobtainable except from the river and to a small extent from wells sunk in the Dujaila depression. Of the latter means they made little use. Digging however was easy, so the plan adopted was to dig the whole position—some 23,000 yards from Sinn Banks to Atab—but to hold it very lightly by means of picquets. The large majority of the force available being kept in reserve in a central position. It should be noted that on the 8th March 1916 the position between Dujaila and the Hai was incomplete, only sections of trench having been dug at intervals. The Turkish organization of these defences seems to have been excellent. It ensured :— (а) The smallest number of troops in front line. (б) Minimum exposure to loss from artillery fire, etc. (c) Maximum facility for re-inforcing any threatened point. (d) Greatest comfort to troops. (e) Ease and convenience of supply by water or road to Maqasis. (f) Most scope for training of troops and their employment on works required, as the majority were available and concentrated well behind the trench line. (g) Use of very little land transport. (h) Avoidance of water-supply troubles on the line distant from the river. Full advantage was taken of the extraordinary containing power oi even the smallest nrmber of modern rifles, especially when combined with an invisible trench. The plan adopted therefore seems to have been to hold the line with small picquets at long intervals, with a nucleus of perhaps two com panies at Sinn Abtar and rather more at Dujaila which was the only portion where, owing to questions of space and supply, a surprise attack was possible. ( 191 ) mm*192 The bulk of the troops were kept concentrated in the area bounded hj Maqasis Canal-Dujaila Depression-Nasafiya Canal. These three chan nels give excellent natural protection for men and animals which was improved by the Turks. The canals are 20 to 25 feet wide and give 10 feet of cover. From this area troops could be moved rapidly to any required point ^either by prepared roads, or by the excellent system of deep communica tions trenches (from 2,000 to 4,000 yards long). It will be noticed that the majority of these lead to the sector Sinn Abtar-Dujaila where our attack must have been considered most probable. In depth, there is only one series of works, the fire trenches of the Arran ment second series, about a mile in rear of the first, being only half complete, though many well dug gun positions exist. The front series, apart from the Abtar and Dujaila Redoubts, consists of from 2 to 7 lines of trenches on a depth of 150 to 500 yards. There is the beginning of a third series in the neighbourhood of Maqasis. On the morning of 8th March the Turkish dispositions are believed to have been :— Sinn Banks Section—104th Eegt. Sinn Abtar Section—103rd Eegt. and Dujaila Section—105th Regt.—All of 35th Division. Each Regiment about 800 strong, but the majority of each Regt. in reserve at Maqasis : trenches held by picquets only. At Maqasis (both banks)—General reserve consisting of the bulk of 35th Division:— 7th Regt. (of 51st Division), 5th and 6th Regts. (of 2nd Division). Each Regiment about 1,500 strong. There were at Shumran (on the left bank) about 1,500 rifles of the 52nd Division available as reinforcements and some battalions of various divisions resting. The total strength therefore actually in the position may have been 1,000 rifles ; immediately available at Maqasis some 5,000 more on the right bank. The fire trenches had been constructed at leisure, by daylight and not under fire. Their outstanding features are :— (а) Inconspicuousness. (б) Trace, ensuring flanking and cross-fire on all ground ahead. (c) Design ensuring ample cover against artillery and enfilade. (d) Provision of alternative position for guns and for infantry conspicuous points had to be held for any reason.193 It is evident that the Turks had realized the difficulties of artillery observation in this terrain especially when complicated by mirage, and the ineffectiveness of unobserved bombardment of large areas. Is most remarkable. Trenches are usually in- Inconspicuousness. . , A , . , , visible at 200 yards. Achieved by — (i) Low command {6'). (ii) Siting. (iii) Provision of dummy line or proximity of an obvious natural line. There is usually little or no parapet. Seldom more than G''. Except in the case of big natural features (Sinn Banks, etc.) which required special treatment, any small rise in the ground or natural bank of water cut is carefully avoided. Dummy trenches and sniper's posts were often made thereon, to draw our fire; but the real trench is at least 100 yards away, often in rear. This is specially noticeable in the later trenches. It is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the ground. Its abso lute flatness, broken only by the small banks of Arab irrigation cuts 6' to 12' in height. The complete absence of trees, and the non existence of any vegetation on the ' putt' except an occasional stretch of 2' high camel-thorn and euphorbia. The Turks sometimes sited trenches in the middle of these patches and without any clearance of field of fire. These were invisible at 30 yards and even escaped observation from aeroplanes on some occasions. The absence of any artificial obstacle along most of the line, though probably due to lack of material, certainly assisted invisibility. The field of fire is often limited to 100-250 yards and even this may be interrupted by bushes, small mounds, etc. But these were of little conse quence as cross and flanking fire was always arranged for by the trace. The Turk sacrifices, when necessary, field of fire to concealment and trusts in the containing power of modern rifles even when no obstacle can be arranged. This confidence has been fully justified by results. Very little of the fire from Turk trenches is normal to the general alignment of those trenches. It is recognised that in times of stress men will usually fire only directly at right angles to the front of that particular bay of the trench in which they happen to be. To obtain cross-fire various devices were employed. The general alignment was not straight, but waved as shown in big sweeps of about 1,200 yards (Figure 1, Map 11). In addition, at intervals of 200 to 300 yards, a few traverses were broken forward from the general line. It was quite impossible to spot these points from the front, but they formed in effect a bastion giving flank fire as shown in (Figure 2, Map 11).194 Along the whole length of the position from Sinn Banks to Dujaila D es ign ; ^ ron ^ ^i 116 trench was of a new ' key ' pattern, with equal sized traverses and fire bays (See Figure 3, Map. 11). The effect of this was :—- (i) to reduce number of rifles available per yard of the whole front, (ii) to make movement along the line difficult, (iii) to give better protection from artillery fire. (iv) is difficult to bomb along, and (v) facilitates counter-attack. (i) One disadvantage of this trace is reduction of available rifles to 8 per 15 yards (say 1 per 2 yards). At a pinch possibly 4 more could fire from back of traverse, but they would have to fire quite straight to their fronts, and even then it would not be very safe for flank men of the bays in front. There was however an M. G. emplacement about every tenth bay. (ii) In none of the more recent trenches would it be possible to use a stretcher on account of narrowness, It is difficult to move even a S. A. A. box along. Wounded were presumably evacuated overland at night. (iii) The trenches at the sides of traverses (shown in Figure 4) give perfect cover from enfilade fire; together with the greatest possible proximity of troops to the firing parapet. This ensures the maximum rapidity in lining parapets to repel assault directly the bom bardment lifts ; and obviates the interval of time required to bring men from bombardment trenches or other shelter at the moment when attacking troops are actually assaulting the position. The disadvan tages of having no obstacle were thus minimized. (iv) This plan of trench is difficult to bomb along. It is almost im possible to throw a bomb over two of the big traverses accurately enough to get into the narrow trench beyond ; and more cover is given to defen ders by the 4 side' trench. Moreover double-blocking would be little use. (v) Provision of many and easy exits from trenches for counter-attack. In addition to the 6' to 10' width of staircase provided behind each 4 traverse ' (as shown on plan Fig. 3) there were steps at each forward corner of each traverse. In the 4 old 5 trace footholes are provided every yard. (1) Arrangements were made at mounds of Sinn Abtar.Dujaila, etc., to give tiers of fire :— (a) Two or even three tiers of fire were arranged, but in every case there are at least two lines of trenches on the level plain in front of the mounds very inconspicuous and both absolutelySINN BANKS LOOKING S.E. (to face page 4 Chap. XIV.)195 down in the liat. The second of these is an alternative line, and in no case could fire be brought to bear from it whilst the front line was still occupied by defending troops. (6) Except in the case of Dujaila and one or two points in the other mounds, the upper tier of fire is from a trench on top and just in rear of the crest of the mounds. Owing to natural irregular ities of which advantage has been taken, men firing from this are not so conspicuous as might be supposed. Bombs lobbed over by a man sitting or lying (under complete cover) in this trench would roll down the front slope into the support trench. (c) At Dujaila there were possible tiers of fire with very deep and good communication trenches between. It is possible that on the 8th March the upper and conspicuous tiers on which all our artillery fire was directed, were not manned at all. {d) Dujaila was the only place, moreover, where there was any efficient obstacle in the shape of a high wire entanglement two bays deep. The argument for invisibility did not hold here as the mound was so conspicuous. For the same reason Sinn Abtar and the Sinn Banks might have been expected to be wired had material been available. (2) (a). Distance from the front to the support line was 30-100 yards. In the majority of cases this was out of the ordinary bombing range. (6) From Support to Reserve Line 200 to 300 yards. In the third line, trenches were made to fire both ways and had elbow- rests on both sides. (3) Absence of latrines, dug-outs, etc. As lines had never yet had to be occupied continuously or fully, probab ly latrines had been left till last. Dug-outs probably considered unneces sary for men in these trenches. Dug-out places for Officers' tents are fairly frequent behind support line. Sinn Abtar and Dujaila which were ' permanently occupied,' are ex ceptions to this. Here there were dug-outs, carefully built ovens for baking bread, latrines, etc., and the sanitation was good. Wells had also been dug, and at one time water was brought to the latter redoubt in a channel from the river. (4) Many more emplacements occur in new trenches than in old. Machine Guns at corner of ba 3 r to fire through an arc of about 60 degrees to a flank. In new patterns a M. G. emplacement every tenth bay. Near Maqasis Fort, which forms a sort of keep about 2i miles behind main positions, there is a row of machine gun emplacements about 200 yards apart in the open plain which are invisible from even a short dis tance. They are invariably sited some distance in front of a water-cut196 '' ite — Emplacements were usually thrown well forward. Both arms of the depression were effectively swept by machine gun fire.

(c) Provision of double set of emplacements at right angles to one another in positions where a big switch might be advantageous. All along the eastern row of mounds at Sinn Abtar elevated positions have been prepared, carefully revetted with burnt brick and having a good ramp leading up to them. These positions are within 250 yards of front line trenches. Between the two rows of mounds are many alter-^ native sets of 4 emplacements, well dug and linked by supervision trenches, etc.; and many more sets facing in various directions have been constructed in the belt of ground from 100 yards to 1 mile immediately west of the main Sinn position, but, mostly close to it, i.e., well forward. (d) Good and plentiful 0. Ps„ Careful and deep digging, and provision of good supervision trenches.. Deep dug-outs for ammunition, personnel and often teams also in com paratively close proximity.

(e) Communication trenches from battery positions to main com munication or other trenches leading to O. Ps.197 if) Provision of dummy guns carefully dug in and in some cases provided with dummy detachments. A good deal of what is described in this chapter is not now visible- on the ground, but the general scheme can be seen.CHAPTER XV. Final efforts to relieve Kut. After the Battle of Dujaila, the Tigris Corps spent the remainder ol the month in consolidating and improving its position in various ways. General Gorring^ who had taken over command from General Aylmer, was at once faced with the two problems of— (а) Defence against floods. (б) Action to relieve Kut. The floods had been expected about the 15th March, and on that very d^y the river rose 3 feet and the Ora Creek flooded. The Umm-al- Floods. Baram greatly increased in size, and the bunds along the river banks were continually breaking, necessitating very heavy work to keep the trench-areas dry and the communications to Sheikh Saad open. The weather was now less cold ^-nd generally fine, with occasional heavy thunderstorms and a strong wind. Kut was reported as having sufficient rations to hold out till April pj an l^h only. Actually, by further reductions in issues and with the help of some 5,000 lbs. of sup plies dropped by the Eoyal Flying Corps after the 16th, it held out till the 29th. General Aylmer had already stated that the failure on the right bank would necessitate as the only alternative, breaking through on the left bank. This was the plan now adopted. The first phase, i .e., the capture of the Hanna, Fallahiya and Sannaiyat positions in succession, was staged for accomplishment by the 8th April. Behind Sannaiyat again, was another position in continuation of the Sinn Banks North of the river. At the end of March the Turks were calculated to have in the vicinity Strengths some ^0,000 men with 96 guns. It seems from information available later that this cabula- tion may have been an over-estimate, but Turkish records vary : and reinforcements were constantly moving down the Tigris. Of these, about one Division was investing Kut, another held the Sinn- Dujaila position, and there was a Division in the Hanna position. The remainder, i .e., one Division and details, were in reserve, mostly about Dahra. A cavalry brigade, estimated at about 1,500 sabres, but more probably only about 400 strong, was operating on the south bank. ( 198 )The British could dispose of about 30,000 men and 130 guns, but were short of H. E., and particularly 60-pr. ammunition. There was a high proportion of shrapnel for the howitzers even. The 13th Division, which was in process of arriving, was fresh, but had been made up to strength after Gallipoli with raw drafts, and was new to the characteristics of the country The 3rd and 7th Divisions had gone through the privations and hard ships of the previous months as well as through hard fighting which had caused them some 14,000 casualties. The 7th Division was on the north bank, and the 3rd Division on the south. There were, in addition, the 6th Cavalry Brigade and 3 non-Divisional Infantry Brigades, viz., 35th, 36th and 37th, directly under Corps. These were all in Corps Teserve. It will be convenient here to give a short outline of the events of the month. The attack on Hanna took place on the 5th April, and the same night the Fallahiya position was carried. The next morning the advance was brought to a standstill in front of the Sannaiyat position. The second attempt to take Sannaiyat on the 9th also failed, and General Oorringe turned his attention to the right bank. Considerable progress Jiad been made on this bank by infiltration and pushing forward picquets, but floods and communication difficulties greatly impeded progress. Abu Rumman was, however, captured on the 12th, and on the 17th the first 3 lines of Bait Isa were captured. That night however, the Turks ^put in their great counter-attack and regained all except portions of the first line. The possession of Bait Isa involved the control of the in undations of the area to the south, and the further advance on Sinn which had been intended, was jeopardized by the liability of this area to iflood at the option of the Turks. A final effort was therefore made on the left bank, and the 3rd Battle of Sannaiyat was fought on the 22nd without success. To take these actions in detail. The Hanna position consisted of three main lines, each about one mile long. The right rested on the river, the left on the Suwaikiya Marsh whose water boundary varied with floods and wind. A mile and a half in rear of this was the Fallahiya position which was not considered strong, but one and a half miles further to the rear was Sannaiyat, where the first, second and third positions were known to be dug and wired, and rear localities were in course of preparation right back to the Suwada Marsh and the Horseshoe Lake opposite Sinn Banks. ^ In the operations under consideration. General Gorringe stated that lie only expected the 6th Division in Kut to co-operate passively at first but he added You are the rock on which I hope to split the Turkish i Drees, and your co-operation by gun fire on his ferry at Maqasis, and by200 containing the enemy on the left bank on the last day of the operations- will greatly assist/' Up till March 29th the weather had been fine ? and the level of the river- had fluctuated and then slightly diminished. On March 30th the fine The battle oiHanna. ^ell hmke. The 31st was stormy and on April 1st there was very heavy ram. Wheeled traffic from Sheikh Saad was impossible. The bridge over the river at the Wadi could not be used owing to high wind. By evening the trenches- were impassable and the relief of the 7th Division by the 13th Division, which had been kept extremely secret as it was desired to conceal from the Turks the advent of a British Division, had to be postponed. On the night of the 3rd-4th April the 13th Division took over, the 7th Divi sion remaining in close support. (1) The 13th Division was to carry the Hanna position at 0455 by surprise without preliminary bombardment, and push on and take- Orders for the ^ secon( ^ P 08 ^ 011 ? a fter which it was to reorga- attack. n ^ ze an ^ inform Corps Headquarters when it would be ready to assault the third position. Three minutes after the infantry advance, the bombardment of the 3rd position and the approaches thereto was to commence. The machine gun batteries of the 7th Division were to co-operate in this advance by fire- from the right bank. (2) The 7th Division was to be in readiness to support; it was to dig communication trenches through No Man's land, make roads, repair bunds, generally mop up, and be prepared to move forward on the receipt of orders. (3) On the right bank, the 3rd Division with the 37th Brigade were to contain the enemy in the Abu Eumman position, and by gun and M. G. fire prevent any movement on the left bank forward of the Fallahiya position. (4) Protection of Wadi Camp was allotted to the 35th Brigade and a cavalry regiment on the north bank, and to the 36th Brigade on the south bank. (5) The Cavalry Brigade from Sheikh Saad was to prevent any hostile movement against our lines of communication. It is evident that the enemy were aware of our preparations. Air reports showed considerable increase in enemy numbers on the left bank Evacuation o£ on 't^e 3rd, and much ferrying activity at Maqasis. Hanna. The result was that, when the 13th Division attack was launched at 0455 on the 5th, it was found that the Turks had eva cuated in the night leaving only a few rifles and machine guns and a large notice on whiA was written ' Au revoir a la prochaine bataille.' By 0700 the 13th Division had reached the enemy's fifth line, i.e., a depth of about a mile.20J Meanwhile air reconnaissance leported the enemy reinforcmg Sannaiyat and Fallahiya. The approach to the latter involved a further advance of about 2,500 yards over open ground. At 1215 the attack thereon was postponed till evening. In the light of after events it seems probable that it was this delay that proved fatal to our success at Sannaiyat. On the right bank the 8th Brigade watching their opportunity had made a bold advance and captured the enemy line south of Abu Rumman about 1130. They were heavily counter attacked by about 3,500 infantry and 2 batteries, but no ground was lost and the position was consolidated. At 1915 the bombardment of Fallahiya opened. Fifteen minutes later the 13th Division advanced and captured the series of deep trenches forming this position. They were held by about 3 battalions of second class troops, many of whom fled throwing away their arms. Although the 7th Division were aware that they would have to paiba through the 13th as soon as Fallahiya had been carried, they had be^n unable to make any reconnaissance of positions of assembly and so on, or to make the preparations beforehand, which are absolutely essential for night operations. About 2100 hours the 7th Division were ordered to take over the Fallahiya trenches from the 13th preparatory to a night march and an assault on Sannaiyat at dawn. Confusion was inevitable, and at the very start considerable disorder was caused by three battalions of the 13th Division retiring through the assembling units. If such an operation is to have any cJbance of success, it is evident that most careful staff work is essential, but no staff officer of either Corps or 13th Division appears to have been present to assist or to superintend the movement of the retiring troops. At the Fallahiya position a net-work of trenches^ of which there was no plan available and previous reconnaissance of which had of course been impossible, had to be crossed in pitch darkness. Some of these trenches were 7 feet deep, and a way round had to be found, counter-marching and changing of formation being thus entailed. It is perhaps remarkable that the leading Brigades of the 7th Division got through in as good order as they did. It is important to remember that not only were the troops uncertain of the position of their objective, but that self location, difficult at all times in this country, was out of the question under the circumstances. About 0510, as it began to get light, the 19th Brigade deployed. The sketch maps (of which there were twc, varying considerably)were unreliable, but the hostile position was guessed to be between 1,500 and 3,000 yards distant. When the first shots were fired at 0535, the 28th Brigade was still advancing in close formation. Within 5 minutes rifle and machine gun fire became intense. Our artillery opened at 0540, but location of targets and observation of fire was impossble. By 0600 the advance had been brought to a standstill at202 a distance estimated at 500 yards from the enemy trench (later found to be 800). By 0700 the remains of the leading line had retired on their supports, and were digging in about 1,500 yards from the enemy under heavy fire. This action of less than two hours cost the 7th Division 1,200 casualties, a large proportion in the first 20 minutes. Chief points to be noted are :— (1) The difficulties of carrying out a successful night advance over unreconnoitred and unsurveyed country, intensified by having to pass through a division that was withdrawing after an action. The further peculiar difficulties of arranging a dawn assault after such a march. It is evident that General Gorringe himself considered the operation all but impossible : only justifiable by the extreme urgency of the situation^ The underlying cause of failure, however, appears to lie rather earlier in the day. (2) The 19th and 28th Brigades detailed for the assault on 6thwerenot put under one Commander. Consequently friction occurred : and there was. no superior authority present to make decision at the critical moment. General Lake in his despatch considers the assault should not have been delivered. The 13th Division was in possession of the whole five lines of the Hanna position by 0700, had suffered few casualties and should not have been much disorganized. No further advance was made for 12 hours, and even then strong opposition was not encountered at Fallahiya. Had the 13th Division been able to push on to this latter position during the morning of the 5th, the night advance and attack by the 7th Division on Sannaiyat could have been organized under favourable circumstances with fair chances of success. The results of such a success might have been far-reaching, as Turkish morale and confidence in the impregnability of Sannaiyat had not yet grown strong. (3) The costly nature of an attack whose hope of success lies in surprise, when surprise is not obtained. Only by surprise or overwhel ming and accurate artillery support was there any chance of a successful advance over this absolutely flat ground in the face of stronglv manned trenches. Surprise failed, and the attack was therefore a sheer impossi bility. It is notable that all accounts agree as to the extremely heavy nature of the casualties incurred from S. A. fire in the first five minutes af ter the Turks opened fire, i.e., at between 1,000 and 1,500 yards. The plan now was for the 7th Division to attack again at 0330 next 7th April 1916. morning with the help of an additional Brigade. But the mischances involved by the first post ponement were now emphasized. A strong north west wind drove the buwaikiya Marsh south, drowning numbers of our wounded and flooding our trenches, necessitating a 24 hour postponement. During the 7th and 8th the 7th Division sapped up to within 400 yards of the enemy front line.203 The 13th Division was to carry out the attack at dawn on the 9tb on a frontage of 600 yards, their left being 600 yards from the river 9th April an( ^ 1,200 yards. The 7th Division on their right were to co-operate by fire, as were the- artillery and machine guns on both banks. One remarkable point in the orders is that no covering fire whatever was arranged on the immediate objective of the division, but only on trenches to the flank and rear. This was probably necessitated by lack of observation which made the direction of fire insufficiently accurate to be possible in front of our own troops. At 0423 the first shots were heard, many flares were sent up, and the enemy's rifle and machine gun fire swelled to great volume, an ominous sign, which in modern war usually spells failure. It was believed at first that the 13th Division had got through, but by 0730 it was known that the assault had failed and the Brigades were back in the lines from which they started. Part of the first wave of the 13th Division actually penetrated into the enemy's first line trench. It lost heavily in doing so, was strongly counter attacked, and forced to withdraw. The front was therefore consolidated 300 to 500 yards from the enemy and the 7th Division again took over from the 13th and started sapping for ward. The stormy weather and the advance of the marsh destroyed most of this work, made reliefs difficult, and facilitated the inundation scheme of the Turks. On the left bank the trenches were so full of water that men had sometimes to swim. On the right bank by opening bunds at Bait Isa and Abu Kumman the Turks had made inundations and marshes of considerable extent. Nevertheless it was decided to operate on the right bank and to force the enemy's Sinn position (south of Sinn banks) whilst containing him in the Sannaiyat position and in front of Bait Isa on the right bank. As a preliminary, it was realized that it was essential to control the floods, and to control the floods it was found to be necessary to be in possession of Bait Isa. The plan now evolved therefore was that the 3rd Division with ths 37th Brigade should take Bait Isa on the 13th April. The ;3th Division should be concentrated behind them on the right bank ready to move, and the cavalry and the 36th Brigade should operate on thci left flank. By the morning of the 14th the troops of the 3rd Division were to have seized those trenches just east of Sinn Abtar and Duiaila which had been constructed by us on the 9th March. This plain failed largely on account of the enormous physical difficulties which had to bo overcome. At this time the Turkish dispositions were estimated at :— In Sannaiyat some 13,000 rifles and 24 guns comprising the 51st and 52nd Divisions and pait of another : about Kut the 45th Division—about204 5,200 rifles and 21 guns ; in the Sinn Dujaila position about H,000 rifles (including the 2nd and 35th Divisions). 35 guns and a cavalry brigade. The above figures may be on the high side. The British had available about 24.000 rifles and 135 guns. It must be remembered however that many of the units included in this force were composite, made up of drafts for Kut battalions, or else amalgamations of units which had lost heavily. The wastage of experienced officers had been enormous. Troops were exhausted and not well fed. There was a shortage of all comforts and of a good many necessaries. A large pro portion of the troops had to be kept on guard duties owing to Arab activi ty. The actual dispositions were:—On the left bank 7th Division, about 6,800 rifles ; on the right bank 3rd Division, about 9,000, and the 37th and 36th Brigades, mustering together less than 4,000, behind them. The 13th Division was at this time about 6,600 strong. En route, marching up the riveT, were a further 5,500 men and 32 guns not yet available. On the evening of the 11th an exceptionally heavy thunderstorm necessitated the postponement of the advance till the afternoon of the 12th, when about 1,000 yards was made by local fighting of an unco ordinated nature which cost us 450 casualties. Another gale to the north east now broke' the causeway behind the 3rd Division and flooded the country from the river to the Umm-al-Baram. All guns were held up and it was impossible to get artillery into positions from which they could support the attack. There were also constant alarms on the left front of Turk and Arab movements, which led to much unnecessary movement of troops. The difficulty of locating the enemy, always extreme in this country, was increased by the knee-deep water between our positions. The Turks, moreover, had skilfully established advanced picquets in the banked up water cuts which, as they held possession of the bunds at their mouths, they were able to keep dry or flood at will. This procedure was unusual tor the Turks, who did not usually favour advanced posts in front of their main defences. In spite of the difficulty of reconnaissance it was ascertained that there was an advanced enemy work running north and south about 8C0 „ ^ yards south east of the front line of their main Preliminary Operation, V&gt; •, t • x- mi • • t • -i -i , 15-4-1916. -^ ar k J- 83, position. This it was decided to seize as a preliminary measure, partly to give a jumping off place for the main attack, but more particularly to secure some observa tion for our own artillery. The attack was made before dawn on the 15th in a heavy thunderstorm, by the 7th and 9th Brigades abreast, each on a frontage of 400 yards. The weather conditions and the state of the ground were most unfavourable, and the compasses were said to have been affected by the heavy lightning, so that a portion of the troops actually moved in a complete circle, and found itself, at daylight205 behind its starting point. One battalion, however, maintains direc tion and captured the trench and a number of prisoners. Between the captured trench and the river some good infiltration work was done by the 8th Brigade who pushed their line forward by means of patrols, making an advance of about half a mile and securing over 40 prisoners m the process. . . In the teeth of great difficulties of movement and communication, preparations were pushed on for the assault on Bait Isa on the ITt at dawn. The plan was to assault Bait Isa 1^4 iqifi with the 3rd Division. The 13th Division was then to relieve the 3rd and keep control over the water cuts, whilst the 3rd Division moved back, marched south and then west, and seized the trenches near Dujaila. These movements seem unnecessarily complicated, nor were the movements preliminary to the attack less devoid of complexity. It is unnecessary to go into them in detail here but a great deal of counter marching was involved both on the right and left flanks, all of which had to be done at night by troops who had been busily engaged and involved in great discomfort and con tinuous fighting, and who therefore were far from fresh at the hour of the assault. However, less confusion arose than might have been ex pected from a study of the orders, and by the early hours of the 17th the 8th Brigade had arrived from the right flank and was holding the trench captured on the 15th, whilst the 7th and 9th Brigades were formed up on its right, i .e., north, preparatory to the assault. The 7th Brigade on the right and the 9th Brigade on the left, each on a frontage of 300 yards, moved to the assault at dawn on the 17th. They had a 1,000 yards to cover and there was a slight mist. The troops actually caught up the barrage and bayoneted the Turks, whom they found sitting under the parapet of their own front line, before the barrage lifted. The assault was wholly successful and a considerable number of prisoners were taken, the mouths of all the canals were seized and trenches further east cap tured, both along the river bank and on the left front. In the latter locality, the troops pushed far beyond their allotted objectives and seized two guns, which however they were unable to get away. This resulted in our left flank being well forward in a sharp salient where it was quite unsupported. It may be surmised, moreover, that men who had already had a long period of very hard work, who had been out the whole of the previous night, who knew that they were to be relieved that evening and that they had in front of them another long night march, probably tried to get as much rest as possible during the day, and that therefore consolidation may have been of a somewhat perfunctory nature. On the Turkish side, it is evident that Khalil realized that the battle had reached a critical stage, and that our possession of Bait Isa, gave us freedom of manoeuvre on the right bank, and he determined to make206 a supreme effort to stop this. He collected every available man (amoimt- ng to about 10,000) m the area betweerx Maqasis and the north end of toe femn Banks, and he organized in the short time at his disposal a counter-attack o the heaviest nature. This counter-attack was supported y all the guns he could collect, and was directed with its left on the elegraph line, so that it moved on both sides of the main trench line runnmg north east from Sinn Banks to Bait Isa. He would thus not only strike full on our left-flank battalion ' in the air ' near the captured guns but would also pass directly on to the gap between the 8th Brigade an the Bait Isa trenches. The troops used included portions of three divisions, of which one was the famous 2nd Ottoman Division. * . Catl0QS of tIlis stroke were n(jt entirely lacking. As early as 1.00 air-reports mentioned ferrying activity at Maqasis : about 1730 tie Turkish artillery opened fire on the 8th Brigade position and on the advanced portions of the 7th and 9th Brigades, this bombardment gradually increasing in intensity ; whilst just before dark a concentration or troops south west of the 9th Brigade was observed. At this time the advanced parties of the 13th Division were already up in the trenches and a I preparations for handing over and for the withdrawal of the 3rd Uivision troops were in progress. Meanwhile the 3rd Division was busily engaged m preparations for its move to the south, for the night march and tor the subsequent capture of the trenches in front of Sinn Abtar. . s ® Mentions had been confirmed, and the necessary instructions, issued at a conference held at 3rd Division Headquarters about 13C0. At 1700, however, a change of plan was notified by Corps Head quarters. The 3rd Division was still to move out southwards but was. then to stand fast m readiness to support the 37th Brigade which was already m position 4 miles south east of Bait Isa. The 13th Division was now to attack the Chahela position (on the south bank of the river 2miles west of Bait Isa) on a 1,500 yard frontage. At 1900 just after dark and by the light of a half moon, the Turkish attack fell upon the advanced troops of tie 9th Brigade and swept these away^ The enemy drove through steadily and swiftly, pushing in the 9th Brigade before them, till they were checked by the 8th Infantry Brigade in the watercut leading across the gap from thelatter's position o ait sa. Here in the darkness there was great confusion. Men of all regiments were mixed up with parties of the enemy, pressing east- wards m bewildered disorder. ^ The 9th Brigade was gradually rallied and formed on the right of the &gt;-tii. Meamvnile the enemy on his left had penetrated far and actuallv captured the 7th Brigade Headquarters. Major General Egerton, however, personally organized and himself led a counter-attack which re-took his eadquarters and re-established communication with the Connaught Rangers who were holding firmly their positions on the river bank. This207 battalion was now ordered to withdraw. The 13th Division who were preparing to move through the marsh and floods in relief, were pushed up to reinforce, and when the attack died down they took over from the 7th Brigade the northern portion of the front line trench which was all that remained in our hands of the previous morning's success. During this night the brunt of the attack had fallen on the 8th Brigade who were holding a long line of Turkish trench, the parapets- roughly reversed and no wire in front. Throughout the night, assault after assault was delivered along this front with the greatest determina tion. In all no fewer than 8 attacks weie beaten off during the night and in the morning the number of Turk corpses left in a band two or three hundred yards wide in front of these trenches, was ample testi mony to the effect of the rifle fire on which the defence had to rely. An average of over 400 rounds per man was expended during the night. The only assistance available from the artillery was from 4 guns of the pack battery, which were in position on the right, practically in the firing line, and whose bold handling and effective fire was of the greatest support, both moral and material, to the defenders. This battery expended every available round in the action. It was found next morning that the 8th Brigade line had only been penetrated in one place by a party of about \60 Turks who were then disposed of. The losses of the Turks during this counter-attack were placed at about 4,000. Our own losses amounted to about 1,650. * During the succeeding few days the 13th Division made various attempts to advance without much success. The situation stabilized and fighting on this bank came to an end. (1) Plan. —General Gorringe's plan depended on mobility. This mobility was conditioned by the state of the ground and his communi- Comments cations, both of which would be at the mercy of the Turks who could inundate them at will. Hence the necessity of being in possession of Bait Isa before any advance could be made on the Sinn position. It is not clear, however, that even the possession of Bait Isa would have ensured immunity from inunda tions further west. In view of the importance of the difficult operation against Sinn Banks it would have seemed advisable to have kept in hand a formation of troops fresh for this action : the 3rd Division who had had some experience of the area in question, seeming the most suitable. In any c^se, it appears that Bait Isa must be an entirely separate operation performed by a separate body of troops. Geneial Gorringe could have made available the 13th Division and some of the 35th, 36th and 37th Brigades. The plan adopted of using the same troops both for the capture of Bait Isa and also for the subsequent night operations against Sinn Abtar, seems to have been one fraught with unnecessary hazard.Again, the actual movements involved in these operations were extremely complex, and involved a great deal of marching and counter marching. The human factor comes in here, as again it does m the events of the 17th, when the troops, already tired, knew they were to be relieved ^nd were to undertake another operation the next night. They could therefore hardly be expected to expend much labour in consolida tion. (2) The effect of rifle fire even at night in this flat ground is well exemplified by the terrific losses of the Turks in front of the 8th Brigade line. The utility of pack artillery boldly handled in close support is also well demonstrated. (3) The remarkable success which attended the rapid organizing and launching of the troops for the Tuikish counter-attack is worthy of note. Their only means of bringing troops from the north bank was by means of a ferry. The troops used belonged to three different divisions. But the plan itself was simple. It was well timed, given good direction and had excellent land marks (the telegraph line and the trench line south wards) to keep it straight. It was composed for the most part of crack troops and was led with the greatest determination. It may be admitted, however, that the enemy were lucky both in the exact time and place where they struck us, and in the disorganization inevitable at the time owing to the reliefs after our assault and our plans for the future. They suffered very heavy losses but the counter-attack certainly attained its object, and stopped any further efforts on the right bank to relieve Kut. Kut was now on minimum rations. The Koyal Flying Corps with the very few planes at their disposal, were attempting to drop food into the town in the most gallant manner. But the planes were of inferior type and there were only 4 or 5 pilots left, who were often flying 10 hours daily. The weather was most unfavourable and in spite of all their efforts little over 5,000 lbs. of supplies were actually received by the garrison in this way. Dropping of food from the air is a difficult and unsatisfactory business, and a very great deal is bound to be lost. The failure to make an effective advance on the right bank compelled us to try once more on the left bank. It was decided that the 7th Divi sion, supported by the 35th and 36th Brigades, should attack Sannaiyat on the 20th April. Weather again interfered and the attack was post poned until the 22nd. See Tigris Corps Order No. 31 (appended). The assault was to be delivered at 0709 by the 19th and 21st Brigades «ach on a 300 yards front and to be preceded by a bombardment of 40 minutes slow and 9 minutes intense. The water between the front lines had been found to be knee deep, and the rate of lift of the barrage was carefully calculated accordingly after experiments. During the night of the 21st'-22nd, however, the river fell 2 feet and as a result20D tlie barrage had the effect of holding our troops back, and moved too slowly. Moreover the assault was actually delivered by the 19th Brigade aJone, as at the last moment the 21st Brigade reported that owing to the mud on their front they would be unable to advance. The 19th Brigade reached the first line only to find it evacuated and full of water. They struggled across this and carried the second line. The mud was appalling and the men had great difficulty in keeping their feet. Rifles got clogged and choked with mud. The enemy delivered an immediate counter-attack along the river bank but this was stopped by the fire -of our artillery and machine guns from the south of the river. Very shortly after a second enemy counter-attack came in on the right of the attacking troops. Owing largely to the effect of mud on their weapons, the 19th Brigade were able to bring very little fire to bear on this and were driven back to our own lines with casualties of 1,300. This proved to be the final effort to relieve Kut. A Red Cross armis tice was arranged by mutual agreement at 1100. (1) Action of 21st Brigade in declining to attempt attack only one ihour before zero hour is inexplicable. The river had fallen during the night so that the water difficulty could not have Comments on 3rd nr rea ter than on the previous day when all Battle of Sannaiyat. &amp; . arrangements had been agreed to. (2) The left of the attack was again kept at a considerable distance from the river, thus allowing Turkish M. G-.'s emplaced there to enfilade attackers with great effect. These M.G.'s were amply protected, by earth behind them, from our enfilade artillery fire from the south bank. A last desperate attempt to re-provision the garrison was made on the night of 24th April when the ' Julnar,' a river steamer, that had been specially prepared and loaded up with supplies, made a desperate and most gallant attempt to run the gauntlet by river. It was stopped at Maqasis. The troops were utterly worn out. The casualties in three weeks from April 5th to April 23rd had been only just under 10,000 men, i.e., Casualties ^ cen ^* 0: ^ : ^ orce - -'- n some formations the percentage was much higher, e.g., the 28th Brigade of the 7th Division had lost in this period over 100 per cent, of its strength and 190 per cent, of British officers, for further details see end of Chapter. Kut held a British force of some 12,500 men (Report in Parliament, 1916, gives 12,530 as number at time of surrender). In the efforts to relieve Kut, the Tigris Corps lost in four months, January to April, 23,000 men in battle casualties, i.e., about 60 per cent, of effectives. The numbers of sick were also very great but are not included. The Turkish lossesduring this period are estimated to have been about 10,000 men.210 The strengths of formations at the end of April were 13th Division 3rd Division 7th Division 35th Brigade 36th Brigade 37th Brigade 6,600 5,900 5,200 2,800 1,570 1,380 23,450 (1) The great difficulty of supporting infantry attacks By fire.

They were stuck in the ground and remained there, although our troops had subsequently advanced beyond them or withdrawn from them. Moreover they were disliked by the troops, who felt they made them conspicuous, which is of course true, and was soon discovered in France. (2) A very striking and unexpected fact was the comparative in efficiency of enfilade fire, even direct enfilade, at short ranges. This was due largely to difficulties of observation already referred to and partly to the design of Turkish field works. It must be remembered in consi dering this, however, that we had very little high explosive of even light natures, no heavy and very few medium guns, and no trench mortars. Trenches therefore were not subjected to destructive bombardment. (3) The rapidity and skill with which the Turks delivered their im mediate counter-attacks. The valour and determination with which these were led was a matter of universal comment and admiration. (4) The passivity of the Kut garrison. The question of the co-opera tion of this force is dealt with later in Chapter XVII. During the period under consideration, it was on very short rations and so, probably, physi cally incapable of any great effort. During this month's operations it. was contained by a force of not much more than one third its strength. (5) The enemy's flanks. The southern flank though no longer open, as it had been early in March, was still vulnerable, and it is evident that General Grorringe recognised this. The inactivity of our cavalry may be accounted for partly by the weather and the state of the ground and partly by apprehensions of the Turkish cavalry (which were over estimated) and still more of the Arabs, who caused constant annoyance. The northern flank on the Suwaikiya Marsh was considered. It was actually reconnoitred by a party who landed successfully well behind the Turkish lines and reported the water only knee deep and the going passable for possibly one battery as well as infantry. The proposal to make an attempt on this flank was considered but was not put into effect.(6) Naval co-operation. The 6' guns of the gun boats of the Tigris Flotilla were used for bombarding back areas. This was the only assist ance the Xavy could give. Guns, especially direct-nre low-traj ectory weapons, of somewhat antiquated pattern, fired from a floating platform cannot be expected to display the degree of accuracy required for barrage fire in modern battle bombardments. (7) Air co-operation. In spite of the inferior material and the small number both of machines and pilots available, the work of the Eoyal Flying Corps was remarkable. The machines they had to use were of such types as the old Henri Farman, the Voisin, and at best the B. E. 2 C. All slow and, except for the last type, with a very poor performance. Aerial photography had not reached Mesopotamia. The only maps available were produced by officers sketching from the air and were therefore quite inaccurate. Aerodrome difficulties were very great. Ground was either flooded or was a sea of heavy mud, and was restricted, at least in January and February by having to occupy the centre of a peri meter camp, such precautions ibeing then considered necessary against the Arabs. The number of machines available was quite inadequate for even normal reconnaissance purposes. Contact or counter-attack work, which would have been invaluable, was out of the question : and artillery spotting was a rare luxury. (8) At this period, in Europe, tanks had not yet appeared, gas was in its infancy, and heavy artillery had not yet reached its full development. The possible effects of the use of such weapons by the combatants in Mesopotamia form an interesting study. In 1915 mechanical transport was already well established in Europe, and reliable. Had Ford vans even been available for General Aylmer, the turning of the enemy's position south of the Umm-al Baram would have presented few difficulties. Although Kut fell, no man could say that the soldiers did not do all that could possibly be expected of them and more, to break through and relieve their comrades. The last attempts to relieve Kut as outlined in this chapter are a story of grit and determination, well worthy of a honourable mention in the History of the War. references to following order are not to maps included with this book Tigris Corps Order No 29, 8th April 1916, 1. The Corps Commander intends to capture the Sannaiyat Posi- tion at dawn to-morrow 9th April 1916. 2. Preparatory to the attack the following movements will take place under arrangements between the G. Os. C., VII and XIII Divisions {a) After dark the 21st Brigade will be withdrawn down stream from its present position to point opposite Masons Mounds whence it will start at 1400 9th April 1916 to rejoin VII Division212 (&amp;) After dark tlie XIII Division will replace the VII Division on the present advanced line between points respectively 600 and 1,200 yards north of the Tigris. (c) The VII Division will concentrate on a front of 200 yards on and behind their present advanced position between the point 1,200 yards north of Tigris on which the right of the XIII Division will rest and the Suwaikiya Marsh. 3. The XIII Division will advance to the assault so as to reach the enemy's 1st line between points 600 and 1,200 yards north of the Tigris at 0445 to-morrow. Ths Division will then press on to the 2nd and 3rd lines, consolidating as they advance. They will clear 1 st, 2nd and 3rd lines lying to the north and south of the area captured by the Division with bombing parties. The front and flanks of the XIII Division will be marked by red flags under the same arrangements as during the attack on Hanna. The G. O. C.,XIII Division, will report to Corps Headquarters at what hour he will be ready to advance beyond the enemy s 3rd line. 4. After 0445 on any outburst of hostile fire the VII Division will assist the XIII Division by machine gun fire directed on the enemy trenches and communication trench in the immediate front of the VII Division. No rifle fire is to be permitted and special precautions will be taken to avoid endangering the right flanks of the XIII Division. 5. Artillery on the left bank under the direct orders of G. O. C., XIII Division, will be in readiness at 0445, 9th April 1916 to bombard the enemy's 1st, 2nd and 3rd line trenches between the following points :— (i) From the Tigris to a point 300 yards north of the river. (ii) From the line G. H. to Suwaikiya Marsh (T. C.-26). When the left bank Artillery opens fire. Corps Artillery and III Divisional Artillery on the right bank under orders of G. O. C., Ill Divi sion, will bombard the enemy's 4th line (T. C.-26) B-S, B-18, B-9, B-10^ B-ll, B-12, B-15, B-4 and targets detailed by Corps Headquarters to the west of that line also the communicating trench from T. to C. They will also counter battery any hostile guns which open fire and will prevent the enemy reinforcing his 4th line. After the left bank Artillery has opened fire the III Division will assist the assault of the XIII Division by machine gun fire on B-8, T. B-18. B-9, B-7 and the communication trench fromT. to C. and on any reinforcements of the enemy west of those fronts. 6. Wounded will be evacuated under Divisional arrangements to a point immediately down stream of the bridge where they will be taken over by A. D. M. S. Corps Troops,213 7. Watches will be synchronised by telephone from the Corps report centre at 0700 to-day and at 0300 9th April 1916. At 0300 G. Os. C. Divisions will report clear line whether they are ready to commence the above operations. 8. S. N. O. will kindly arrange to join Corps H. Q. and for H.

XIII Division, will be replaced in position selected by G. 0. C., XIII Division under cover of darkness to-night in the vicinity of Crofton 0. P. During the advance of the YII Division they will maintain a heavy fire on the opposing enemy in front of the infantry of the VII Division, which will be marked by red flags. This fire will be controlled by direct observation from the right bank under the direct orders of G. 0. C. XIII Dmsion. 6. Under the orders of A. A. and Q. M. G. water transport for the guns and detachments (without mules) of the 35th and 36th Brigades will be kept in readiness above the bridge to enable the guns and detachments to be ferried across to join their Brigadiers when ordered. 7. Lieutenant Colonel Ogilvie, R. E. under the orders of the C. E. will select a site for a bridge in the vicinity of Bait Isa. 8. Wounded will be evacuated under Divisional arrangements to near the c£ Medjidieh' immediately below the bridge where they will be taken over by A. D. M. S. Corps Troops. 9. Watches will be synchronised by Corps Signals at 1900 to-night .and at 0400 to-morrow. Divisional Commanders and B. G. E. A. will report at 0600 clear line whether they are ready to commence opera- tions. 10. Corps report centre at present Corps Headquarters. Acknowledgment by wire requested.

Extract from VII (Meerut) Division report on the operations of April, 1916. The orders for the concentration of the YII Division ox) tiie 5th April in eastern portion of the trench system are shown in Operation Order No. 28, which is attached as Appendix III. (Not attached.) The concentration was completed by 1545. 2o The attack of the XIII Division being successful, the various working parties for making roads and repairing bunds were sent out ^t 0630 , and at Of 15 the 21st Brigade was sent forward to the enemy's captured first and second lines to collect arms and to clear that portion •of the battlefield. 3. I was called to Corps H. Q. at 0915. The Corps Commander explained the situation to me, and gave me preliminary instructions for the operations in which he intended to employ the Vli Division.216 4. The XIII Division was going forward to attack the Fallahiya Position, this attack to take place shortly after noon. At 1430, the YII Division was to advance and take up a position in rear of the XIII Division, preparatory to a night march and the attack afe dawn of the Sannaiyat Position, between the marsh and the long com munication trench (T. C. 18) (Not attached). 5. On my return to Divisional H. Q., I gave my preliminary instruc tions for the proposed night march^and attack at dawn to the G. Os. C. 19th and 28th Brigades, who were to carry out the attack. A Divisional Staff Officer, accompanied by a Staff Officer of each of the above Brigades^ went forward to carry out a reconnaissance of the ground over which the night march was to take place. This reconnaissance failed to obtain any information as the attack on the Fallahiya Position by the XIII Division had been postponed until dusk, and the ground over which the night march was to take place was still held by the enemy. 6. At 1430 the Brigades moved forward independently, and were concentrated by 1630 about 8-D-0-6 (T. C. 18). 7. The 21st Brigade was ordered to go forward as soon as the XIII Division had captured the Fallahiya position and take it over from the XIII Division. This was duly carried out; the 21st Brigade moving forward at 2130. 8. YII Division Operation Order No. 29 for the night march and attack at dawn is attached as Appendix IV. (Not attached.) 9. The 19th and 28th Brigades assembled at the starting points as ordered but considerable confusion was caused by units of the XIII Division returning from the attack on the Fallahiya Position passing through this point of assembly while the two above Brigades were forming up. Owing to the delay thus caused, the Column did not leave the start ing point until 0155. During the advance up to the Fallahiya Position, other units of the XIII Division were encountered, some marching back and others bivouaced in shallow trenches and ditches, running across our line of advance. West of the Fallahiya Position, empty Turkish trenches formed serious obstacles in the dark, and caused further delay. These trenches, obliged the Column to alter its formation as over a particularly deep tiench only one crossing place could be found, and Brigades had to get into column of route to pass over this. 10. Owing to these delays, I ordered the two leading Brigades to deploy into attack formation at 0500, while still some distance from the enemy's position. As no reconnaissance of the position or of the ground could be made, and as the maps differed, there was considerable uncer tainty at the time as to the distance between this position of deployment of the position to be attacked. It was afterwards found to be about 25000 y^rds.217 11. After deploying, the Brigades advanced to. within a 1,000 yards of the enemy, when a heavy rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire was opened on them at 0535. The light was not sufficiently good to enable the enemy's position to be clearly seen and the advance managed to continue for a few minutes longer, by which time the leading troops had got to within 700 yards of the position. From this point, any further advance was impossible by day, as the ground was .quite flat and devoid of any cover. The lines dug themselves in where, they were, the rem^ nants of the two leading lines falling back by degrees to the third line, which was about 1,000 yards from the enemy's. position. The 21st Brigade was in reserve, about 2,500 yards from the enemy's position. It was my intention to renew the attack under the cover of darkness, when an advance over open ground presented a better prospect of success. ; By 0730 my position had improved, and the trenches gave suffi cient cover to enable the troops to reply to the enemy's fire, and the latter lessened appreciably. 12. At about 0915, the Corps Commander visited my H. Q. v and ordered me to renew the attack that night, placing another Brigade at my disposal. I decided to attack between the marsh and the com munication trench, on a two Brigade front, each Brigade having a front age of attack of 200 yards. The two other Brigades were to be in sup port, a detachment being sent to make a feint attack by fire on the enemy's position south of the communication trench. I intended to carry out my attack at 0300. 13. There had been a wind blowing all morning from the north-west, and this wind strengthening, the marsh began to advance towards our trenches. At 1215, the 28th Brigade who were on the right and nearest the marsh, reported the water to be rising rapidly and at 1300 the most advanced troops had to fall back ; the water having entered their trenches. Attempts had been made to make a bund to keep out the water, but near the front trenches the enemy'§ fire interfered with this work. 14. At 1440, orders were received from the Corps that the pro posed attack was postponed for 24 hours, owing to the rise of the marsh, 15. A line of defence for the night 6th-7th April was selected. The 28th Brigade was ordered to hold the trenches from the marsh to 150 yards south of the communication trench, the 19th Brigade held the ground from the left of the 28th Brigade to the River, and the 21st Brigade was kept in reserve about 900 yards in rear of the centre. 16. On the 7th April, I went to see the Corps Commander at 0700 and received instructions to advance against the whole of the enem /^s front, with a view T to getting as far forward as possible, digging in and consolidating a new line as close as possible to the enemy's position. p 2218 17. This advance commenced at 0915, being preceded at 0700 by the bombardment of the enemy's position by the guns on both banks of the river. 18. The 28th Brigade advanced on the right, the 19th Brigade in the centre, and the 21st Brigade on the left, echeloned behind the left of the 19th Brigade. The left of the 28th Brigade directed on a line cutting the Sannaiyat Position about 150 yards south of the communication trench. The batteries in support of the Division were distributed in three groups, and one group was affiliated to each Brigade. 19. It was soon apparent that the position was still held in strength, and the advancing troops came under heavy fire. At 1000 no further advance could be made without suffering unduly heavy casualties, so the infantry dug themselves in and commenced to consolidate a new line. The line was about 800 yards from the enemy on the right, and 1,000 yards on the left. % 20. The enemy's fire was heavy and their machine guns in the front iine were very active all day, causing numerous casualties. 21. G. Os. C., 19th and 28th Brigades being called to Divisional H. Q. confirmed me in the opinion I had formed—that our lines being still far apart, an attack across so broad a stretch of open was unlikely to meet with success, even at night. If the proposed attack could be postponed for another 24 hours, the troops could advance again at night and dig another line further forward and thus reduce the open space over which the attack would have to go. This was represented to the Corps, and was approved, the attack being postponed accordingly. 22. An officer's reconnaissance was being carried out the night 7th- 8th April, across the arm of the marsh just north of the Sannaiyat Posi tion. The distance across the water was 4,000 yards, the water was nowhere more than 5 ft. deep and the bottom was hard. The reconnoi- trers landed on the shore behind the enemy's position and formed the opinion that a force of an Infantry Brigade and a Mountain Battery would be able to go by this road. On the 7 th April, a bombardment of the enemy's position was carried out at 21oO. It was preceded by three rockets fired from Divisional H. Q. This was the signal for four minutes artillery bombardment followed by an interval of two minutes without bombardment or rifle fire, and finally half a minute intense bombardment accompanied by rifle and machine gun fire. The object of the interval was to make the enemy believe our infantry was advancing to the attack and so induce him to man his parapet fully. The scheme seemed to attain the result aimed at, as the enemy's fire was very heavy when the half minute's intense bombardment took place. 23. During the night 7th-8th April, our lines advanced under cover of darkness and dug in 200 yards nearer the enemy.219 24. The XIII Division was ordered to attack the enemy's position at dawn on the 9th April, the VII Division being withdrawn to the right flank of the XIII Division, and taking up a position of readiness. VII Division Operation Order No. 30 was issued, and is attached as Appendix V (Not attached). By this Order, the VII Division was to have the 28th! Brigade holding the front between the marsh and the right of the XIII Division, the 19th Brigade was to be in rear of the 28th Brigade, and tha 21st Brigade was to return to its former position in reserve. 25. The concentration was completed by 0310 on the 9th April and the advance of the XIII Division commenced at 0420 ^ the first shot of the enemy being heard at 0423. This attack failed. 26. At 0750 I went to Corps H. Q. and was informed by the Corps Commander that the VII Division was to push forward by digging and sapping without delay. The two Field Companies and the Pioneer Battalion, XIII Division, were to be attached for this work, and the VII Division was to take over the remainder of the line from the XIJ1 Division after dark. This was modified later, the 40th Brigade XIII Di vision remaining on the left of the line and holding the river for 600 yards to the north. The 19th Brigade took over the section of the line between 28th Brigade and the 40th Brigade. 27. No forward work was done during the day as it was determined to push the infantry forward after the moon had set, to dig another line as far as possible in front of the present line. Any sapping operations: would thus have been wasted, and the technical troops would be employed more economically in opening communication trenches after dark, and commencing the sapping forward next day from the forward front line. 28. After the moon set about 0100 on the 10th April, the infantry advanced and commenced to dig a new line 150 yards in advance of the present line. The enemy set up many flares which interfered with work but the new line was progressing well, when the wind blew the waters of the marsh across our front and flooded the new trenches, rendering them untenable, and wasting the nights work, as they had to be abandoned. 29. During the day, the 28th Brigade was drawn back into reserve and the 21st Brigade moved into the right section of the front line. 30. The Brigades in the front line were ordered to advance again on the night lOth-llth April as soon as the moon set, to dig a forward line 200 yards in advance of the present line. The work of the previous night had put the enemy on the alert, and the new line progressed slowly on account of heavy sniping by the enemy. The forward line could not be dug as far forward as ordered, and was only 150 yards in advance of our original line. 31 1 Work on the new line was continued by sapping on the 11th April, and during the night ll-12th April this line was completed and220 four communication trenches were also completed running from it for about 1,200 yards eastwards. 32. The 40th Brigade, XIII Division, was relieved in the front trenches during the night llth-12th April, the 19th Brigade taking over the left section of the trenches, and the 21st Brigade taking over the right section. The technical troops of the XIII Division also rejoined that Division. 33. The XIII Division was to have gone over to the right bank of the river on the night 12-13th April and the dispositions of the VII Division were to have been as follows:— 21st Brigade holding the front trenches ; Two battalions, 19th Brigade, to be attached to the 21st Brigade ; 19th Brigade, less two Battalions, to hold the Bridge-head and pro vide security for the Fallahiya Camp. 28th Brigade to cross the right bank and occupy the Abu Rumman Mounds. • The 9th Brigade, R. F. A. was to join the XIII Division, and artillery of the VII Division was to have been as follows :— On the left bank.— 66th Brigade R. F. A. (less one Battery). '72nd Howitzer Battery. 77th Howitzer Battery. 104:th Heavy Battery (less one section). On the right bank — One Battery, 66th Brigade, R. F. A. 1-lst Sussex Battery, R. F. A. 34. During the night llth-12th April, there was a heavy thunder storm which made movement difficult, and Corps ordered the above movements to be postponed for 24 hours, and later orders notified this, fend the re-adjustment of artillery was ordered to take place on the 12th April. 35. On the afternoon of the 12th April, a sudden and very strong gale from the north ea«t sprang up, the water in the marsh rose suddenly the heavy waves quickly broke down the bunds, and water entered the trenches. The rush of water was very sudden, and it came down the trenches in a wall, giving the garrison no warning, and completely filling the trenches with a few minutes vi passing the bunds. The garrison of the front trenches north of No. 1 communication trench lost their entrenching tools, blankets, and some of their rifles, but were able to save a&gt;l the machine guns. The trenches of the right section had to be evacuated the garrisons getting behind the parados on the south of No.. 1 communication trench, but having to give up the first three lines of trenches north of that communication trench, as the water rapidly destroyed the parados.32 7 221 36. The troops were much exposed when leaving the f oj ward trenches^ and the enemy opened a heavy rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire, causing us some casualties, but the coolness of the troops and the rapidity with which they manned the parados and opened rifle and machine gun fire militated against the accuracy of the enemy's fire. 37. The enemy's trenches were also flooded, and the garrisons of the first three lines had to evacuate them, some remaining behind the parados of their trenches, and the remainder retiring. These troops offered a favourable opportunity to our infantry, and it is believed our rifle and machine gun fire caused them considerable loss; one Regiment alone claiming to have accounted for over 200, the Machine Gun Company, 21st Brigade, firing 10,000 rds., at favourable targets with good effect. 38. The rise of the marsh extended all along the northern flank of the area held by the VII Division, and over-ran the bund flooding almost all the ground north of the long communication trench several batteries being surrounded by water. The marsh receded as soon as the wind dropped at 0720. 39. Work continued to counteract the effects of the flooding all night and fire was kept up on the enemy's trenches, to interfere with similar work on his part. 40. During the 13th April it was obvious that the enemy's trenches on the northern half of his position had been flooded, as the garrison had to expose itself freely, thereby offering good targets to our infantry. This was confirmed by aeroplane reconnaissance. Durmg the day, several large working parties were broken up by our artillery and rifie fire, and at 2100 our artillery, in co-operation with the infantry, bom barded the enemy's front trenches. 41. Our leit section was intact, the water from the marsh haviug been kept out of this section, but all the trenches ot the right section were flooded, and a new system had to be dug, the new trenches being in close proximity to the flooded trenches. 42. On the evening of the 13th April, the technical troops of the Division commenced sapping operations trom the right of the left sectio i. Only three saps were begun that night, as the troops had been at work all day, but in the morning eight saps in all were being dug. 43. During the 14th April, a strong wind from the south blew aU day and the water of the marsh receded about 1,200 yards from ixs usual level, or about 1,600 yards from the level it had reached on the 12th April. 44. On the 17th April, No. 12 Company Sappers and Miners, was attached to the VII Division for work on sapping operations. During the nighit 17th-18th April, the three southerly saps ran into water, and work tfeem had to be discontinued. This left 6 saps only-222 45. On the 18tli April, orders were received that the VII Division,, supported by the 35th and 36th Brigades, was to assault the Sannaiyat Position on the morning of the 20th April, the date of the attack being- postponed later to the morning of the 22nd April. 46. Reconnaissances sent out on the night of the 18th-19th April found that the ground for 300 yards on each side of No. 2 sap was fife to advance over, as it was generally dry with some patches of water at few inches deep, which would not form a serious obstacle. North and! south of this belt there was more water, and the surface of the ground under the water was muddy and slippery, and formed a considerable obstacle to troops. It was therefore decided to attack the above portion of the enemy's trenches on a two Brigade front. This decision was, approved by the Corps Commander. 47. It blew hard during the 19th April, and at 1500 the wind veeredl round to the north and the marsh commenced to rise rapidly. The- bunds i.ept the water out for some time, but by 1700, the bunds were- submeiged in places and subsided, the water entering again into the* trench »ystem, flooding all the trenches north of No. 3 communication trench, and covering the ground between Nos. 1 and 2 communication trenches with some two feet of water. At 2200 the wind died down, but the water remained high, and tfie level of the marsh did not decrease more than one foot. 48. Prior to the rising of the marsh water had further interfered with sapping operations and work on the first parallel had to be discon tinued between No. 3 and No. 4 saps. When the marsh rose, the water- entered into all the saps except No. 4, and the first parallel, where com pleted, was flooded except between No. 4 and No. 5 saps, and all work on the saps had to be abandoned. 49. The Sannaiyat Position was bombarded by the artillery on both oanKs on the afternoon of the 20th and the bombardment appeared to- be eftective. 50 During the night of the 20th-21st April the 19th Brigade specially reconnoitred the ground west of our front line along the river with a view to ascertaining whether an advance on that frontage was. feasible. 51. The Corps Commander came to my H. Q. at 0700 on the 21st April and held a conference which was attended by the Brigade Com manders. The attack on the Sannaiyat Position as originally decided on was to have been carried out by the 21st and 19th Brigades, the 21st Brigade being north of No. 2 Sap and the 19th Brigade south of No. 2,Sap, each Brigade being on a frontage of 300 yards. The reconnaissances carried out during the night 20th-21st April showed ttiat a line of advance along the river bank was feasible, but they-223 also showed that the water in the vicinity of No. 2 sap had subsided^ andJ both Brigadiers agreed that the attack could take place on the front originally decided on. The original plan was therefore adhered to, and Operation Order No. 33 was issued for the attack. 52. During the afternoon of the 21st April, the marsh again rose^ about 2 inches, but no further rise was reported. In order to enable- the right of the 21st Brigade to advance over ground clear of water, the- dividing lines between Brigades was altered to No. 3 sap, thereby moving: the front of attack 100 yards to the south. 53. A sudden rise in the marsh would cover with water the ground over which the 21st Brigade was to advance, and to meet such an even tuality, Brigades were informed that if the frontage of attack had to be- reduced, the 19th Brigade would carry out the attack, the 28th Brigade would be in immediate support of the 19th Brigade, and the 21st Brigade- would remain in position covering with fire the advance of the 19th^ Brigade. 54. Patrols during the night of the 21st-22nd April reported that the water on the front of the 21st Brigade appeared to be receding, and the ground over which the 19th Brigade was to advance was almost dry ex cept for some ditches of water about one foot deep. 55. The Brigades assembled as directed in Operation Order No. 33 and artillery registration commenced at 0630. 56. At 0605, the 21st Brigade reported by telephone that it would not be able to advance over the frontage allotted to it on account, of the state of the ground. I therefore ordered the attack to be carried out by the 19th Brigade, supported by the 28th Brigade, informing the* Corps Commander who approved of this alteration. 57. The artillery on both banks of the river carried out a slow bom bardment from 0620 to 0700. At 0700 the bombardment became' intense, and the assaulting infantry commenced to move forward under cover of this intense bombardment. 58. A 0709, the artillery lifted and the 19th Brigade assaulted the position, the Highland Battalion being on the left with a frontage^ of 200 yards and the 92nd Punjabis on the right with a frontage of 100 yards. The enemy's front line was captured without difficulty and with few casualties, but the trench was found to be full of water, and the ground between the enemy's 1st and 2nd lines was very wet and heavy and in tersected by numerous short communication trenches and dug outs in &gt;7hich our assaulting infantry got bogged, and over which they could only advance slowly and laboriously. As soon a- the infantry got over the enemy's first line, fire was opened on them fiom the enemy's fourth line, Z-9—Z-10 and from the treucLes towards ths river. Several-224 •counter-attacks were also launched against our advancing troops from the south. 59. In spite of the difficulties of the ground and the heavy fire of the enemy, the 19th Brigade penetrated beyond the enemy's second line, some men getting into the third line. On attempting to open fire it was found that a large proportion of the rifles were out of order through the breach mechanism being clogged with mud, and little reply could be made to the enemy's fire. 60. The Brigade reserve of the 19th Brigade was sent in on the left flank of the attack at 0730, as the Highland Battalion was under heavy fire from the south. This reserve was not able to advance beyond 200 yards from our front line. 61. The 28th Brigade was directed to move forward to the left of the 19th Brigade and push in, but its leading troops did not get beyond our own front line. 62. The 21st Brigade was ordered to push in troops to support the '92nd Punjabis on the right of the 19th Brigade, and at 0740 the British Composite Battalion advanced and reached the enemy's front line with little loss. 63. At 0800 the 19th Brigade reported that the British Composite Battalion was falling back, and at 0308 this Brigade reported that the 92nd Punjabis were also falling back, but that the Highland Batta lion was holding on. Shortly after the Highland Battalion began to come back and by 0820 the attacking troops were all back in our own lines. 64. The original advance was greatly assisted by the covering fire of machine guns and artillery on the right bank but after our assaulting infantry had reached the enemy's first line, on account of the proximity of the opposing troops, the covering fire could not be continued, nor could it be directed on the enemy enfilading our troops from the south. 65. At 1130 some of the enemy were seen to be leaving their trenches in rear of their third line, and to be collecting wounded under red crescent flags. As no further assault was possible we followed the example of the Turks, and sent our bearer parties under red cross flags 'to collect our wounded. By 1400 all our wounded had been collected and brought in. 66. After dark the 35th and 36th Brigades were withdrawn to the right bank of the Tigris, and the 19th Brigade was brought back into •divisional reserve, the 21st Brigade taking over the right section of the ifront line, and the 28th Brigade taking over the left section. 67. The General Officer Commanding would like to place on record iis highest appreciation of the splendid valour shown by the troops throughout the series of opgfgLtions which have lasted throughout the ipast four months (from Jmmvy 3rd to April 29th 1916). It has fallen225 to the lot of the VII Division time after time, owing to the urgency of the situation, to make frontal attacks against strongly entrenched posi tions across perfectly level plains without a vestige of cover. On each occasion these attacks have been more and more difficult owing to the heavy casualties amongst officers and men, and the disadvantages under which newly made formations suffer ; yet again and again have these gallant troops responded with devoted courage to the calls made upon them, in the hopes of rescuing their comrades in Kut-al-Amara. 68. To illustrate the severity of the fighting and the immense diffi culties with which the General Officers Commanding Brigades and Officers Commanding Regiments have had to contend a few instances may be quoted. The following are some instances of the losses of units of the Division since the fighting commenced in January 1916 :— {a) Battalion. Landed with other Ranks. Now left other Ranks. 2nd Bn.

(e) For losses in the 28th (Frontier Force) Brigade, see Appendix VII, page 25 (not attached). (/) Only for three days in these four months have the troops been out of contact, day or night, with the enemy. 69. These facts speak for themselves, but Sir George Younghusband would not like to let the occasion pass without adding his humble tribute of admiration for the magnificent and undying courage which has carried the troops of the VII Indian Division through these great trials, dangers, and hardships. They have shown a soldierly fortitude of which they and their Eegiments may be proud. (Sd.) G. F. YOUNGHUSBAND, 3rd May 1916, 1600.{ 227 ) CHAPIEK XVL The Defence of Kut. At 0600 hours on December 3rd, 1915, the 6th Division, 30th Brigade and Cavalry Brigade arrived at Kut after the retreat from Ctesiphon. The strength of the force was 1,505 sabres, 39 guns and 7,411 bayonets, and the press communique said that General Townshend's force had retired to the fortified line of Kut-al-Amara. In all sieges there are four main considerations for a commander— (1) Defences. (2) Food supply. (3) Ammunition supply. (4) High morale and good health of the troops. On these will depend their offensive spirit. A besieged force is a detachment without any liberty of manoeuvre. It must be full of the offensive spirit if it is to co-operate adequately with the armies in the field. The fortified line mentioned in the press was represented by a mud walled fort at the north-east end of the peninsula, three small block I Defences houses along the neck, and a single barbed wire fence joining up the whole line. It had never been contemplated to make a defensive position at Kut. The force had never been defeated. In any case it was never imagined that it would be thrown on the defensive permanently before reinforcements arrived. Consequently defences were merely made again c t marauding Arabs, and the fort was designed to hold the garrison of a large line of communication post. The area now to be defended was roughly 3,200 yards by 2,700 yards. The north-west front was 2,700 yards long and was the vital line to be defended. The river front had also to be watched as, at low water, the river contained numerous shoals over which the enemy could possibly wade. It was also decided to hold the Liquorice Factory on the right bank, and west of the Hai. This place contained a large amount of grain at the time, and it has been said that its retention enabled the 44 Sumana ' to be protected. Although it may have been desirable to hold the Liqu orice Factory long enough to remove the grain, etc.; from the point of view of the protection of the Sumana, and the protection of Kut from shelling the place did not appear to be of any more importance than many other points on the right bank, and it was the wrong side of the .Hai from the strategical point of view.228 The position at the Liquorice Factory as far as could be seen did not prevent the Turks using the Hai, and what could be done in this direction could be equally well done from Kut itself. On arrival in Kut, General Townshend organized his defence in three areas :— (1) North-west sector, 1 Bcigade. (2) North-east sector, 1 Brigade. (3) Southern sector, including the Liquorice Factory and Kut, 1 Brigade. The General Reserve consisted of 1 brigade, the 16th or 30th, which ever was not in the north-west sector. The bulk of the artillery was located round the brick kilns with a battery in the palm groves and the 4-7 guns in horse boats on the river. The fort proved to be an excellent 0. P. 2 miles from Kut and on the flank of our position. The first line of defence to 'be prepared was that along the line of the wire. The block houses were destroyed as they proved very good ranging marks for the enemy, and the excavation of the line began on the 4th Dec. General Townshend states that the Indian troops were too tired to dig. Officers who were present do not agree with this state ment. In any case there were two other causes which prevented quick work. Firstly the troops were very short of picks and secondly they were told to reserve their ammunition. The Turks were allowed to approach to close range, dig in, and hinder our working parties while our troops could not reply adequately. The front line was joined up by the 15th. with, a single fire trench, and four redoubts were built into it later. The second line was completed by the reserve brigade by the 12th. A middle line was dug by Christmas. Thus there were three lines of defence some 400 to 1,000 yards apart. After Christmas the retrenched line was dug in case it should be necessary to evacuate the fort The Liquorice Factory and river front were also entrenched and the communication system gradually improved. The whole area was sniped throughout the day. The Turks themselves sapped close up to the front line, being within 50 yards of the Fort, Liquorice Factory and one point on the northern sector. Altogether the defenders dug some 30 miles of trenches. The food supply and the various predictions as to its quantity were to exercise a profound influence on operations. The Military Governor was authorised to buy all the gram n.-Food supply. in the town; alld apparently the G. 0. C. had given orders for full details of supplies to be prepared, but he says he was afraid to search the Arabs' houses until relief appeared doubtful It was these fears for the Arabs that led to the premature battles of Shaikh Saad, Wadi and Hanna, for General Aylmer believed that he must reach Kut about January 15th.'A*.229 It was not easy to judge the amount of supplies available. It wa&amp; difficult to count and check under constant fire as they were scatter ed in various localities. On the river front sacks of atta had been hurried ly put up as a parapet before December 3rd. Thefts were constantly occurring and hidden stores constantly coming to light. Finally, the output from grinding the grain was never estimated correctly. Nevertheless there appears to have been no systematic search made in the Arabs' houses till January 20th and on the 26th General Town-^ shend wired to General Aylmer that he had 84 days' food left. Only two days before he had wired :— I have 22 days food left but by collecting all the atta in the town and eating up all the horses, we can last much longer. On receiving the second telegram General Aylmer replied ££ I am delighted that his (T's) food supplies are now found much better than I could know from previous telegrams. This information had it been communicated to me before, would certainly have modified much of what I have unsuccessfully attempted to do.' In addition to the ordinary ration there was an almost unlimited amount of horseflesh. The difficulty was to persuade the Indian troops^ especially the Hindus, to eat it. It was first brought on the ration list on January 26th and the majority of Indians held out against it till April 13th. Sheer hunger then broke their resistance and about 9,300 men came on the ration list, but their abstention before had greatly depleted the supply of grain and weakened their health. It was calculated that those who still held out were receiving a ration of 600 caloric value. At this period, when the ration of the remainder was. calculated at 1,600 calories, men were dying at the rate of 15 a day. It must be remembered that there were 5,000—6,000 Arabs in the town, whom it had been found impossible to evict for political reasons* These came on our ration strength on April 15th. Many tried to escape on rafts but the Turks naturally hindered this in every possible way. The amount of ammunition available of all natures gave cause for some anxiety at the beginning of the siege. During December when the Turks were threatening attack and twice III.—Ammunition. ^ i -i .I p ^ t , i attacked the tort, our expenditure was heavy. There is no doubt that if the attacks had been more continuous,, ammunition would have run short. As it was, when the siege ended, large quantities were still unexpended. The troops passed a good many nights dumping it in the river, but the Turks salved a large amount of shells and used them later as land mines. The morale of the troops did not appear to have suffered in any wav by the retreat. The men knew that they had been victorious oii230 ^every occasion on which they had met the enemy. They believed that IV Morale after the battle of Ctesiphon they had been forced to retire through no fault of their own. As General 'Townshend states, his division had been filled with drafts before the ifirst battle of Es Sinn in September. But it would not appear that the fighting qualities of the troops had deteriorated, nor that their march ing capabilities had been impaired. Above all they believed in the .skill of their commander, who as late as January 2nd could say that ^the morale of his forces was excellent. There was no question of failure to be relieved. The commander evidently intended to adopt an offen sive role when he expounded his plan of operations, how from the entren ched camp of Kut-al-Amara he would maintain liberty of manoeuvre on either bank by means of his bridge. During the siege, of course, morale deteriorated, and the G. 0. C. rated it very low, much lower indeed than the officers or the men them selves. The hospitals appeared fuller than they ought to have been. A few desertions took place and the Turks tried to subvert the loyalty of the Indian troops by tying seditious literature to our wire defences. JBut there is no reason to suppose that this had any effect. However the morale could not in any case stay at a very high level for ithree reasons. (1) The number of British officers in units was much below strength. The 110th Mahrattas had only one at one time, and the 117th was later commanded by an S. &amp; T. officer. (2) Trench warfare always has a bad effect on troops. Except for two small raids, no offensive operations were actually carried through. On many occasions, of course, the troops assembled to co-operate with the relieving column, but nothing further took place except the march back to our bivouacs and this was had for morale. :(5) The low scale of rations from February onwards had its effect On March 4th the British were receiving a subsistence allow ance only. The Indians were on less than a subsistence scale. The scales of rations do not show what the men really received, for by the time the meal was cleaned, not more than 75 per cent, of edible matter remained. Horseflesh of a tough and fibrous nature could not make up for the lack of hydrocarbons. General Townshend's communiques at first had a good effect on morale but visits by the commander and his staff to the troops would have been even more effective. There are no troops so bad that a com mander cannot fire them, and it is difficult to understand why the com mander and staff of the 6th Division were so rarely seen.231 Townshend says, the hospitals were too full, but this was only natural as they were the only places where food was moderately plentiful and there was no work. The siege of Kut may be divided into three phases. i. First Phase, December 6th to January 31st, 1916, on full rations. ii. Second Phase, February 1st to March 8th on half rations. iii. Third Phase, March 9th to April 29th on starvation rations On the 6th December the cavalry brigade was sent down river where its mobility could be more usefully employed than in the restricted area of Kut. The decision to stand at Kut had been taken by General Townshend after much reflection on the situation and research into the teachings of history. As he says, 'We must only retire into an entrenched camp when we can reckon with perfect certainty on an approaching reinforcement.... I have shut myself up in Kut reckoning with certainty on being relieved by the large reinforcements now approaching at Basra. . . .1 shut myself up in Kut on the distinct understanding that I was to be relieved in a month.' What he calls, ' an absolute promise of relief,' exercised a great influence on him coupled with the acceptance of his decision to stand by General Nixon. Unfortunately the offensive role of the force and the projected manoe uvres on both banks were soon out of the question. There had been no time or organization to establish a bridgehead on the right bank. The company on the right bank guarding the bridge was driven in by the Turks and the bridge had to be destroyed. This was a very serious matter as it practically limited our scope of manoeuvre to the left bank i.e., to a frontage of 1J miles. On the 11th and 12th the fort was hea vily attacked and Kut bombarded, but the Turks were repulsed with a loss of 2,000 men. On Christmas eve the Turks made a feint against the Liquorice Factory and the 52nd division made a determined attack on the fort. Nine battalions advanced but only two penetrated the position. Severe fighting ensued during the 25th and at length the enemy was ejected in hand to hand fighting. On various other occasions attack seemed imminent, especially against the Liquorice Factory, but nothing eventuated except violent bombardments and heavy rifle firei In the last days of 1915 the force was holding its own against the ^enemy and was in good health and good spirits. Casualties had amounted to 1,774 up to 31st December. All looked forward with confidence to a speedy relief. The defences round Kut were more or less complete. There was abundance of food for a considerable period. Ammunition was sufficient for probable requirements. The weather was fine and cold. The river was fairly low. Optimism prevailed.232 But this optimism was soon to have a rude shock. Instead of a- victorious advance, the relief force was unable to break through. January 17th it had suffered 7,000 casualties and only numbered 9,000. The enemy forces were estimated at 12,000 opposite General Aylmer and 5,000 were said to be blockading Kut. On 20th January a severe storm broke and flooded our first line trenches up to the sandhills. The Turks were in a similar plight, and both sides retired to about a mile apart. But the effect of the rain was more serious down the river. Air reconnaissance was impossible and the waterlogged nature of the country immobilised the relieving force. The only gleam of good fortune, ona could not call it good management, was that Kut suddenly produced 84 days' supplies. The first phase closed, therefore, with the following situation. Kut was on half rations and able to hold out till April 17th. It had suffered 2,240 casualties to that date. The relieving force was fCradually concentrating for the next effort, which everybody thought was bound to succeed. The floods were due on March 15th. Kut was now out of all danger of attack. The enemy had evidently Second phase decided merely to blockade it. The floods were the next anxiety since the peninsula would be- [jartially inundated, unless the necessary measures were taken in time. The garrison now settled down to a life of humdrum routine. Bat talions spent one week in the line, alternating with one week in bivouac and reserve. The line was the favourite place, as it did not suffer so much as the town from bombardments and air raids. On the other hand, a certain amount of food was to be picked up from the Arabs, if one was in bivouac. Every evening at dusk the infantry and sappers turned out to build a strong bund across the peninsula at the middle line and the Arabs- were employed in strengthening the river front bunds. The chief question of this period was how to co-operate with the- relieving force. The battle of Hanna had just been fought and lost. General Aylmer, himself, was not convinced of ever being able to reach Kut. ' Flesh and blood,' he said^ C£ cannot do more than the troops have- done against the enemy and the extraordinarily adverse conditions of cold and floods.' A sortie from Kut to Shaikh Saad was negatived by A. H. Q. and various plans were produced to co-operate with General Aylmer in his next move. During the bombardment of Hanna on February 22nd, a striking force was assembled ready to attack any hostile force retiring past Kut. The force was to be divided into two columns :— Column ' A ' 2&gt;\ battalions, 1 F. Coy. S. &amp; M. and 1 battery E. F. A.. (1 guns).233 Column cc i? ' 6 battalions, 48t]i Pioneers and 1 battery R. F. A- It could only debouch from Kut on a frontage from the fort to redoubt 44 A However as the Turks did not retire from Hanna, the force did not operate. The question of operating on the right bank was made difficult owing to the lack of a bridge. But the country here was more open and the frontage less restricted, though the Turkish entrenchments on the- south-east of Kut -had gradually increased. It was calculated that with the assistance of the Sumana and a flying bridge, 4,000 men could be crossed over in eight hours. It would take twenty more to carry across two four-gun batteries. If the wind sprang up the flying bridge could not be worked and the numbers transported would be reduced by 150 men an hour. However General Townshend agreed to make the crossing when the relieving force was seen to be coming round south of the Dujaila redoubt in the forthcoming operation. Early on March the 8th,the force deputed to cro^s, consisting of two weak brigades, assembled in the palm groves south east of Kut. Each man carried 150 rounds and one day's food. Second line transport carried one more. The attack on Dujaila redoubt, miles distant, could be seen in the haze. The cavalry could be seen manceuvring furthex south but the relieving force came no nearer and no attempt was mad e . to cross. On March 9th General Aylmer retired and in Kut the besie ged settled down again to their normal routine. There were, perhaps, two occasions on which a sortie from Kut would have been possible. After the battle of Hanna on January 21st, it might have been possible to pass a force of some 4,000 men across to the right bank to march to Shaikh Saad, 25 miles distant. At that time the Turkish forces on the right bank at Sinn and near Kut were weak. The floods covered about 1,300 yards of the northern sector and the weather must have temporarily demoralised the enemy. But would the result have beer worth it ? The remainder of the garrison of 3,000 bayonets with weak artillery support could probably not have held Kut against assault. Force 'D' would have gained the remnants of the 4,000 men who broke out, and lost Kut in January. Gallipoli, it must be remembered had just been evacuated, and the C. I. G. S. attached importance to a victory in Mesopotamia. Recollecting the optimistic atmosphere of the time, when there was still no thought of defeat, I think we can unders tand A. H. Q.'s message to Generals Aylmer and Townshend when he oflered to break out. The only circumstances,' ran the telegram, c&lt; which could in my opinion justify this course would be the demoralisation of your (relieving), force.' Q 2234 Secondly, it might have been possible to co-operate with the reliev ing force on March 8th. The troops were keen. The enemy had been taken by surpirse at Dujaila and an additional threat might have caused a general retirement. Success would depend on determined leading on the parts of the commanders of the sortie and of the relief force. On the whole the chances seem to be well in favour of success, but it must be remembered that surprise would have been difficult. Enemy agents in the town kept the Turks informed of our movements and two Arab mahaila men had escaped at the end of February. Yet, in spite of this, the Turks do not appear to have had to the south and east of the town, more than 2 Companies, 4 machine guns and a few guns the last bsing only sent occasionally, for special purposes, and then withdrawn. -General Townshend's own opinion however, as expressed in his book is that 44 co-operation was of little practical use.' On March 17th the floods rose and gradually increased, making the right bank into a marsh near Kut. Opportunity for offensive action had passed. The health of the troops was now rapidly deteriorating. On March 1st there were 1,470 men in hospital, including Third phase. 5go cases of scurvy. Among the British troops beri-beri had broken out. On the 18th March the ration was : British. Indian. Bread Meat Dates Oatmeal . . 8 oz, . 20 oz. . oz. . 2 oz. for a short period. Barley Gki . Date« . Meat . . 8 . 1 . n . 8 oz. oz. oz. oz. and supplies were calculated to last till April 17th. The medical arrangements were extraordinarily difficult during the sieze. Owing to the confined space, the hospitals in the town had to be near headquarter offices and were consequently often under fire. The town itself was the most insanitary place we occupied in Mesopo tamia. The whole interior including the streets and lanes, the banks of the river and the surrounding area for a distance of 250 yards was made use of as latrines, the surfaces of the streets and bye lanes were the urinaia. Fortunately no infectious diseases broke out. The hos pitals were only capable oi containing 1,500 patients and the less sick were obliged to convalesce with their units. Through the siege 2.446 wounded and 4,977 sick were treated in hospitals. On the whole the health of the Indian troops was lower than that of the British owing to the low allowance of atta and no vegetables. During the first six weeks of the siege when iresh meat was available, the Indian troop?235 had only three issues, and later their refusal to eat horseflesh sapped their strength. The British troops had the advantage of a convalescent depot which was formed for them, and a soup made from animal bones and issued from March 4th was.much appreciated. On April the 9th the meal ration was cut down to 5 ozs. to last till' the 21st and on the 22nd a further cut was made to 4 ozs. On the 15th the greater part of the Arab population had to be fed, and it was pro posed to drop food into Kut by air. 5,000 lbs. would give a 6 oz. ration to :— British 2,970, Indians 10,870 and Arabs 3,700. On April 15th 3,350 lbs. were dropped, on the 16th 1,333 lbs, on the 17th only 400 lbs. and from the 18th the weather was too stormy for flying. One plan remained as a forlorn hope. A river steamer, the Julnar, tried to run the gauntlet at 2000 on the 26tlL But it was overcome by the Turks at Maqasis. On the 29th Kut surrendered with an emergency ration theoretically still in hand to consume on that day. Two lessons of this siege stand out above all others, Firstly, the importance of the food supply. ' Economy of force,^ and u the employment of the principal mass,' at the decisive point are principles again and again emphasized in u My Campaign in Meso potamia.' But the commander of the relieving force could not exploit these principles because he did not know when was the decisive time ' i.e., the duration of Kut rations. In December General Aylmer judged it to be January 15th. By February Kut, in itself, did not exercise much influence on time for all practical purposes, at any rate in the near future. During the whole of the first phase, the troops were on something near a full ration and at no time was any distribution of food made on a sensible or reasonable scientific basis. Common sense dictates that supplies are of the first consideration in a siege. In the siege of Kut supply arrangements were neglected till it was too late. ' Defeat is impossible,' was the thought of the troops. 44 Relief is a certainty ' was the thought of the commander. 44 At least the relieving force will hack its way through eventually in the good old British way ' was the thought of all. One main reason why Kut fell was because neither the commander inside nor the one at the Base seemed to realise that victory, or relief depended in the last resort on the full stomachs of the troops. Secondly, the passivity of the defence. It has been shown how topographical 'features made a sortie- very difficult, though on March 8th there was a strong probability of successful co-operation with the relieving force. As a rule the Turks had a whole division round Kut almost entirely on the north bank, with a varying reserve at Shumran236 But except for two small rajfls not a single offensive move was ever made beyond the defences. No effort was made to detacli troops from oppo site the relieving force. Another lesson is the great importance of retaining potential power of manoeuvre. There was a bridge intact at Kut when General Townshend arrived there, and for a week later. He jeopardised this, for what seem inadequate reasons, and then had it blown up in such a way that the majority of the material was lost to him. He himself saw clearly, and constantly reiterates, the only useful •function of his detachment i.e., to detain as many Turks as possible : numbers at least as great as his own. In this he failed, and that failure may have been largely due to Turkish certainty that he had insufficient bridging material, and that therefore a break-out on the Southern bank was very difficult. Lastly the question of the Arabs. For political reasons it was considered advisable that they should be kept in Kut, and humanity dictated this course. Nevertheless their presence was an extremely serious handicap, and the numbers should have been very largely reduced, many more being expelled and their stores of grain purchased. It may have been humane to keep the Arabs in Kut and allow them to eat up their own grain and ours, but when the terrible results of this solution of the problem in sold iers' lives are considered it is hoped that in a similar situation the plan adopted inKub will be avoided at all hazards.

(to face page 1 Chap. XVII.)CHAPTER XVII. The possible co-operation of the Kut Garrison. The question of the possible co-operation of the Kut garrison was examined on the ground in considerable detail in the light of available records and with the assistance of officers of the garrison and relieving force. Co-operation would have been greatly simplified had General Town- shend kept his bridge of boats intact. The loss of this bridge Was very unfortunate. It not only enabled the Turks to invest the peninsula completely by holding a short front with forces considerably smaller than the garrison, but it handicapped General Townshend's liberty of action so severely that, in fact, no action was taken by him. During January there was considerable telegraphic correspondence between Generals Mxon, Aylmer and Townshend on the subject of co-operation between the garrison and the relieving force. General Townshend himself originally suggested a break out. General Aylmer, who, it would appear, was the only one of the three to realize the difficulties with which the relieving force would have to contend, took up this suggestion and began to consider it seriously. General Nixon was not in favour of such a plan. The difficulties of carrying out the operation began, also, to grow upon General Townshend. In response to a telegram from the latter with a £C forlorn hope ' ring about it, General Mxon wired on the 17th January that he did not agree with General Aylmer's appreciation of the situation, u that such a course {i .e.. General Townshend to break out on the right bank and to be met by General Aylmer) would be fatal to Townshend's force, fatal to the force in Mesopotamia, and fatal to the Empire,' and he emphatically forbade it. General Aylmer, however, still put forward the view that the only way General Townshend could help was by a sortie. General Lake * eventually, on the 23rd January, consented to the preparation of a plan for a break out, to be put into force in case of extreme necessity. Two days later. General Townshend discovered that he had food for another 84 days. General Aylmer thereupon said that this altered the situation, and the matter was allowed to drop. The next chance of co-operation that offered itself was in connec tion with the attack on the Dujaila Eedoubt on the 8th March. It was the possibility of co-operation on this occasion at^d on the right bank, which was chiefly considered by the Staff College. *He had assumed command on the IQth January. ( 237 )238 It was not possible to co-operate, without excessive loss, on the left bank, owing to the strength of the Turkish investing lines and the floods, which narrowed the area of egress. Before coming to a conclusion as to whether it was possible for General Townshend to co-operate on the right bank, there are four main factors to be considered :— (i) The condition of the troops. (ii) The means of crossing available. (iii),The artillery support possible. (iv) The safety of Kut, in the event of a portion of the garrison crossing to the right bank. By the 8th March, the troops were not so strong physically nor as fit as they were at the beginning of the siege. There* is not the slightest doubt, however, that a sufficient force could Tue condition o! the ^ ^ t i • ^ ^ n t troops. nave been mustered, which would have been capable of performing all, and more, than Would have been required of them. It would have been necessary to have weeded out all unfit men from the units chosen for the operation : and for the selected men to have been specially trained and strengthened with full rations for at least 10 days previous to the attempt. To account for the issue of full rations to a proportion of the garrison, and for the special training, every effort must have been made, in view of the number of Arabs in Kut, to mislead both our own troops and the enemy into the belief that the intention was to effect a break out on the left bank. The steps taken might have included the manufacture of trench bridges and the issue of bombs, etc. Other steps, such as a bombard ment of Hanna, on the night of the 6-7th March also suggest themselves. 3,000 reasonably fit men would have been available for the operation. The bridge having been destroyed. General Townshend must have relied on the tug Sumana, with a barge lashed on 16 m availa C ble Cr0SSing either side, and 2 flying bridges, which the Sappers actually had prepared. There were also available some 30 ' mahailas.' General Townshend's own Staff had calculated that a force of 4,000' rifles and 2 sections of field guns could have crossed the river, with the: above means, in 7 hours. Any force crossing at or near Kut East Mounds, could have been well supported by the field artillery of the garrison from their existing battery positions, as far as the Duiaila depres- Artillery support . i ^ r ^ t r™ • n f possible. S10n eas ^ ^ ^he mounds. This would have been a range of just under 5,000 yards from the gun positions, Th^re was no difficulty about observation which was.239 excellent. The whole country from the Dujaila Redoubt to Maqasis^ was visible from the roof of General Townshend's Headquarters in Kut. Counter battery work would also have been necessary, to prevent heavy fire on the Sumana during the crossing. There was no difficulty in this, as all the Turkish gun positions were accurately known. The majority of the Turkish guns were sited on the left bank up-stream of Kut. Any plan involving the transfer of a part of the garrison to the right The safety of Kut must have included adequate arrangements for the defence of Kut during the absence of the co-operating force. Owing to the ground in front of the north-west sector of the front line being under water, as a result of the floods in January, the safety of Kut could have been satisfactorily arranged for. The only place where the Turks could have made a serious attack was in the north east sector. This was held throughout the siege by the 17th Brigade^. This Brigade could have remained responsible for this sector. One battalion of another brigade, with the aid of the cavalry details, would have been sufficient to hold the flooded north-west sector. A reserve of 2 battalions could have been made available as a general reserve to the defences : one of these battalions being taken from the Liquorice Factory, in front of which the ground was flooded. It may be concluded, then, that there was a reasonable chance of General Townshend being able to cross a force to the right bank, with a view of co-operating with General Aylmer, and that operation this could have been well supported by artillery. With regard to the point of crossing, As mentioned in Chapter XVI, the Liquorice Factory, where there was a bridgehead, was tactically unimportant: it was strategically the wrong side of the Hai, and its occupation protected the shipping no better than would have the steep banks by the Kut East Mounds. These mounds are the banks of an ancient canal, about 10 feet high, well suited for the formation of a bridgehead, and strategically the right side of the Hai. This locality would, it is considered, have been the best place for any bridgehead on the right bank and, although not occu pied by us, was obviously the most convenient place for any crossing. By the occupation of the mounds, the enemy would have been dep rived of all observation on the right bank, except for the mosque of Mohammad Abdul Hassan, which could have been dealt with by artillery. The right bank of the Tigris here is difficult, and exact points of landing would have required careful selection. The form that General Townshend's co-operation might have taken, depended on General Aylmer's intention. The latter might have attempt ed merely to join hands with General Townshend and get away as many240 of the garrison as had been able to cross ; or he might have attempted to roll up the enemy on the right bank from the Dujaila Redoubt north wards, a course, which, if successful, would have automatically effected the relief of Kut. In the first case, the fewer Turks General Townshend had to contend with, the better : for this reason it would be advisable to start crossing as late as possible so that the Turkish reserves should not be alarmed too soon. In the second case, the greater the number of the Turkish reserves from Maqasis that General Townshend could draw upon himself, even at the expense of his bridgehead being driven in, the better, because the enemy would have been drawn away from the decisive point, i.e., the Dujaila Kedoubt. The second conception is, undoubtedly, the sounder. It seems therefore, that General Townshend should have begun to cross soon after dark on the night of the 7th March. Assuming that General Aylmer's plan, as regards the relieving force, was that which he actually attempted to carry out, and that General Townshend was to co-operate by crossing to the Kut Bast Mounds during the night of the 7-8th March and to act against the Turkish reserves at Maqasis, the problem to be solved by Kiazim Karabekir, the com mander at that place would have been very difficult. It would be fairly certain that some information as to some opera tions being afoot in Kut would have reached the Turks. It is probable that the Turks would have increase^ their reserves at Maqasis by 1 regi ment, and brought up the strength of the investing force on the north of Kut to one division. It is reasonable to suppose that the commander at Maqasis would have received information from the piquets on the river bank, one hour after the crossing had begun. Three courses would then be open to the Turks :— {a) To attempt to drive in the bridgehead at once. This would be a difficult operation to arrange in the dark, and in the face of considerable artillery fire from the guns in Kut. It is more than likely that the force employed would still be engaged when dawn broke, and the main attack on Dujaila had begun. {b) To reinforce Dujaila at once, realising that General Townshend's action would only be in concert with an attack by the British on the right bank. This would leave General Townshend free to enlarge his bridgehead, to advance in the morning and threaten the Turks from the rear, after having dealt with the weak battalion holding the river bank frcm the Hai to Mohammad Abdul Hassan,oa.

(to face page 6 Chap .XVII.)241 {c) To move the reserves to some central position near Sinn Abtar, and wait till the morning before deciding on his course of action. Kiazim Karabekir was a good commander. One cannot say what he would have done. Probably his best course would have been to have attempted to hold off General Townshend in the morning with a part of his reserves, and kept the remainder to act towards Dujaila. Actually, no proper co-operation was attempted. General Town shend assembled about 3,000 rifles in the Palm Groves and Transport lines in Kut, and had made all arrangements for crossing. He did not intend, however, to start to cross until he could see the troops of the relieving force advancing on the near side of Dujaila. This was tantamount to not co-operating at all. His force could not have had any effect in drawing off enemy reserves from the decisive point. He would have had to cross in daylight, a more difficult operation, and affording the Turks better opportunities for sinking the Sumana. In addition, his force would not have been in a position to advance from the bridgehead till later in the day, when the battle would already have been decided one way or the other. As there was, in fact, no real co-operation intended, it did not matter whether General Townshend was put under the orders of General Aylmer or not. Had the co-opera tion suggested above been incorporated in the plan, it would have been most necessary for this to have been done. General Aylmer would then have issued orders to General Townshend and maps as used by the Tigris Corps could have been dropped by aeroplane. We came very near to winning the battle on the 8th March, in spite of the disastrous delay which occurred before the attack started and in spite of other mistakes, which have been commented on in Chapter XIII. The scales were held so evenly that a very little more weight on our side would have tipped them in our favour. This weight could have been applied by General Townshend crossing or even attempting to cross to the right bank, and operating as outlined above. If he had only succeeded in getting a reasonable proportion of his force across, there would have been every prospect of relieving Kut.CHAPTER XVIII. Events of the summer, 1916. After the fall of Kut tlie situation stabilized for the summer. On- the left bank the 7th Division remained in close touch with the Sannaiyat position in a state of trench warfare. On the south bank the 13th Divi sion was similarly in touch at Bait Isa, whilst the southern flanks of the opposing forces diverged, leaving a No Mans Land many miles in extent. Behind the 13th Division was the 3rd Division, and in reserve the 14th Division (formed on the 12th May) of the 35th, 36th and 37th Brigades. The condition of the troops was far from good. There was a great deal of sickness, not only dysentery and scurvy due to poor rations and a lack of fuel, but also cholera which broke out sharply at the begin ning of May. Heat stroke, due to the lack of shelter and the extreme severity of the sun, was very common, and there was a good deal of fever. All the above were greatly aggravated by the plague of flies, largely due no doubt to unburied corpses. The discomfort, if not actual dissemination of disease, due to these myriads of flies is indescribable. Every dish, every scrap of food, every utensil, was black with them.. Their buzzing filled the air, and a swarm settled on every man's back,, hat, and every other portion of him from which he was unable con stantly to brush them off. The torment caused to the sick and wounded for whom there was little tentage and no mosquito nets, is incredible to anyone who has not undergone it. Apart from the lack of accommodation at the front for the enormous number of hospital cases, there was not yet anything like sufficient accommodation in hospitals down the river, nor proper means of transporting patients thereto. Eations were still inadequate and ration reserves at the front had fallen to a dangerously low ebb. The troops in fact were tired out, physically debilitated and greatly dispirited, and there seemed little prospect of conditions improving in the increasing heat. On the 19th May the 13th Division found that the Turks had with drawn from their front at Bait Isa. The main reason for this was Khalil's plan for the Persian campaign in connection with his Pan-Turanian obsession; also no doubt the advance of the Russians had some effect. The Turks were found to have withdrawn to the Har. and on the 20th May the 3rd Division was pushed forward via Sinn Abtar, and a line was taken up from Maqasis through Imam-al-Mansur to Dujaila. The weakness of the troops and the extraordinarv severity of the sun. ( 242 )243 ♦can be gauged from tlie fact that on this short march of 10 miles, nearly 10 per cent, of the troops were knocked out by heat stroke. The effect of this advance on our communications, already strain ing our inadequate transport to the limit, was still further to increase the difficulties of supply. All second line transport was now pooled. Divisional Supply Columns were formed, and to supply the forwird troops a ration convoy left Sheikh Saad for Sinn every fourth day. The provision of transport and protection for these convoys taxed our resources to the utmost. Convoys had to move at night on account of the heat, they were of great length and very vulnerable, moving as they did in a blinding cloud of dust and offering an irresistible oppor- • tunity for loot, of which the Arabs constantly took advantage. It must be remembered that battalions were extremely weak, the effective strength being sometimes as low as a hundred with only one British officer, thus making it impossible for a whole battalion or even two effectively to protect a column of transport in the darkness and dust, against a determined attack by a small body of Arabs bent on looting and getting away. The Arabs in fact grew bolder and bolder throughout the hot weather, being encouraged no doubt by our failure to relieve Kut, and being well informed as to our weak points and exhaustion. An item of some interest was the arrival of a sotnia of Cossacks who had ridden 200 miles across difficult Persian mountains. After remaining a fortnight they returned to General Baratoff. This incident though it had no material results, was not without moral effect. The front was now organized into three areas. The left bank area under the 7th Division, right bank forward area under the 3rd Division, right rear area under the 14th Division. The latter two Divisions changed places during the summer. The 13th Division was withdrawn to Sheikh Saad and later to Amara for the purposes of training, and in order to reduce ration strength at riverhead. For the latter reason all possible animals also were sent down stream. The construction of the 2' G' 7 railway from Sheikh Saad was commenced. This eventually solved the supply question. It reach ed Twin Canals on the 4th August and Sinn on 3rd September and its capacity had greatly increased by the end of December. As the railway grew, a line of blockhouses connected by a barbed wire fence on the South African pattern was simultaneously constructed immediately to the south of it, in order to put a stop to the marauding by Arabs. This it eventually succeeded in doing to a large extent. Lieutenant General R S. Maude assumed command of the Tigris Corps on the 11th July and became Commander-in-Chief of Force ' D ' on the 28th August when Major-General A. S. Cobbe took over the Tigris Corps. It is noteworthy that they were the two most junior244 Major Generals in the Force ; but it may be remembered that by now- the control had passed from India to the War Office. Already Major General G. F. MacMunn had been appointed Inspector General of Communications. It is unquestionable that to the above appointments the reorgani zation and future success of the Mesopotamia!! Expedition was largely due. It is worth while going in detail into some of the improvements effected during the hot weather. First, with regard to organization. The Divi sions at the front were formed into two Corps, the 1st and 3rd, in the Autumn. As far as strength would allow, efforts were made to get troops out of the line for training at regular intervals. The lessons ^ of France were studied and considerable changes in tactics introduced. In some formations the great effect of rifle fire in this country was appre ciated and methods evolved for attack in view of this. Throughout the year there was a considerable increase in artillery, especially in medium guns and howitzers so essential to deal with earth works. These were provided with tractor draught, which was found very satisfactory. Reserves of shell, and especially of H. E., were built up. It was found that the great heat had a serious effect on the latter and steps were taken to minimise this. One of the severest handi caps to freedom of manoeuvre during the Spring had been the shortage of pontoons, aggravated by the immobility of all bridging material except by the method of towing by river. Bridging trains completely mobile over land were now formed. It may be said here that without these General Maude's success would have been impossible. Stokes Mortars, grenades and Very lights, were made available. Machine gun companies were formed or brought out from home. Gas masks were introduced, though these were never actually found neces sary. In May we possessed 5 aeroplanes all antiquated. During May and June the Turks had undoubted air superiority with modern types of machines. By July we had countered this, and by December we had 24 up to date machines with 20 well trained pilots ; also the latest bomb ing and photographic devices ; the latter enabling accurate maps to. be produced. From July onwards, there was a steady improvement in the comfort and health of the troops. The sick admissions for the week ending 1st July were little short of 9,000 fighting men alone, apart from followers.. That is to say, 100 per cent, per month. By November admissions had sunk to a quarter of the above figure, and as there had been a con siderable increase in total strength, the actual percentage of sick was probably not more than 10 per cent, per month by then. Amara and Sheikh Saad had been organized as large hospital centres and great.Communication Trench. Kut. S inn B anks looking Westwards. 2ncl line. (to face page 2 Chap. XVIII.)i4*f 245 improvements had been made in the deplorable medical state of affairs at Basra. The accommodation available for sick had already risen from less than 5,000 beds to 18,450 even in July. Moreover, proper arrangements had now been made for evacuating the most serious cases to India. The average evacuation ex-Mesopotamia from May to August inclusive, was 7,000 men per mensem. During the same period the average arrivals of reinforcements at Basra per mensem were 16,000' personnel and 2,150 animals. It will be evident that any improvement in the conditions at the front and all possibility of future developments depended on increase in the efficiency of the troops and particularly of the lines of communi cation. The latter was taken in hand with the greatest energy by the Inspector General of Communications and a few of the improvements effected are touched on below. Map 12 shows the organization of the lines of communication by the autumn. In addition to the Sheikh Saad railway, construction was commenced on a line from Basra to Nasiriya. Still more important, 75 miles of ^ . 2' 6' gauge from Qurna to Amara was opened on ai wa ^ on ° mmunica ' 28th November and saved 95 miles of river, which moreover was the most tortuous and difficult portion from a navigation point of view. The capacity of this line was from 200 to 300 tons per day. In spite of great efforts, the Force at the end of November, was still short of 2,000 mules and over 2,000 A. T. Carts. The introduction Field transport. of mecliailical transport had, however, begun and one Ford Company had already arrived. This was the beginning of a very large organization of which full details may be found in Colonel Leland's book {4 With the M. T. in Mesopotamia.' Mesopotamia is, however, primarily a country of river communica tion. It was therefore the development of river transport which was River Transport, m ost essential. The amount of river transport available on May 1st, 1916, is summarized below together with the increase made in the next four months. Available River Transport. 1st May. 1st September.

Great increases in shipping available were expected in October, November, and subsequent months. It must be remembered that vessels arriving in the country at this period required a considerable amount of fitting up, for which there were small workshop or technical resources available. The most econo mical way of despatching transport up river is by means of suitable steamers with iron barges lashed on each side. Not only was a large proportion of the steamers supplied from India unfit for this work, but the design of the barges had, in the teeth of local technical advice, been altered in India. The result was that even when they did arrive they proved useless. The deliveries in tons at river-head daily were— Average Average daily delivered. requirements.

Their establishment at this time was just over 7,000. It rose eventually to 43,000. (For details see Col. Hall's book u I. W. T. in Mesopotamia.') General Maude remained at Basra supervising the essential founda tions of all future operations, viz,, the administration and reorganiza tion of the Force, until he was satisfied that these were in a fair way to efficiency. Thus it was not till October 1916 that General Maude moved his G. H. Q. up to Arab village, close behind the front. It will now be of great interest to examine the situation as it appeared to the G. O. C.-in-C. at this time. His instructions from the C. I. G. S. are given at the end of this Chapter. Briefly they were—to protect the oil fields and to occupy and control Basra Vilayet. In addition he was, if practicable, to obtain a footing in the Baghdad Vilayet : deny hostile access to the Persian Gulf and South Persia ; and prevent hostile parties from reaching south of the line Shustar-Isfahan. It will be useful accordingly to examine briefly the Q ' factors upon which his plans would have to be made.247 These were:— t(i) Daily output required at Advanced Base foi a Force of 4 Divi sions, 2 Cavalry Brigades, Corps and Army Troops.

J R248 It will be seen therefore that by the autumn an entire revolution had taken place in the aspect of affairs. The troops were now well fed, fully equipped, and properly accommodated. The medical arrange ments were ample and in good working order. Modern weapons of war had been provided. Land transport was approximating to the authorized scales and the lines of communication promised before long to be in a position to fulfil any demands made upon them. It was doubtless in view of the above factors and as a result of per sonal inspection of the situation, and discussion with General Maude^ on the spot, that General Sir C. C. Monro, who had stopped for the month of October in Mesopotamia on his way out to take up the appointment, of C.-in-C. in India, despatched to the C. I. G-. S. the telegram given at, the end of this Chapter. To summarise this period :— The British throughout had been superior in numbers to the enemy- force immediately opposed to them. They had, however, suffered casualties on an almost unprecedented scale. At the beginning of the hot weather they were suffering from the knowledge that they had failed, to relieve their comrades in Kut. The climate, inadequate rations and. transport, and disease had affected the health of the troops to a dan gerous extent. Bad communications, the hopelessly inadequate trans port, and inefficient administrative organization, were the foundations of the problem. Sir Percy Lake had already commenced reorganization. This was later facilitated by the widespread indignation aroused by the disclo sures of the Mesopotamia Commission. Above all the fact that the Mesopotamian Force had passed from under the direction of India to that of the War Office, resulted in whole-hearted support by the latter. The actual steps taken to improve the situation during the summer were (a) the appointment of an energetic and far seeing Inspector General of. Communications with the capacity of thinking large ; the improvement of the base at Basra ; and the reorganization of the whole Lines of Communication. (6) The provision of transport—river, rail, M. T. and animal, (c) Buildiiig up of a reserve of supplies, ammuni tion and stores, {d) Reorganization of all administrative services. (e) Reorganization and concentration of the striking force on the Tigris Front. (/) Improvement of the health, discipline and training of the troops. The whole result was a remarkable transformation of the effi-- ciency of the force by December 1916. One of the chief factors in this was without doubt the bold action and personality of General Maude. He was a man of strong will and great self-reliance with an incredible capacity for work and for taking, pains. He had an exceptionally fine brain for organization, and his knowledge of detail was remarkable, Nevertheless it must be rem-249 embered that the foundations of the reforms had been laid by Sir Percy Lake, and, above all, without the support of the War Office the results would not have been possible. This point raises an interesting ques tion for the future. Will it be ever possible again to commit to the control of India the direction of an overseas expedition, on any consider able scale ? To turn for a moment to the enemy. The moral effect of the surrender Kut on the Turk, and no doubt throughout the East, was enormous. It was indeed a defeat of British arms unprecedented in Asia since 1842. During the Summer the Turk was content to hold us in Mesopotamia. Indeed, of the 49 Divisions at his disposal only 3 were allotted to the Tigris front. These 3 comprised the 18th Corps under Kiazim Karabekir, an able and energetic commander. The 18th Corps formed part of the 6th Army, which was commanded by Khalil Pasha, a young man with an exaggerated opinion of his own genius, who was a connection of En- ver Pasha. The inaction of the Turks throughout the summer is interesting. Although Khalil must have known the British were prepar ing for an offensive, his previous success had given him such contempt, for our forces that he was confident that he could hold any attack on the Tigris front with the 18th Corps alone and this in spite of the warn* ings of the Commander of that Corps. Khalil made the mistake of under-rating his opponent, the same mistake that had been committed by the Indian Government earlier in the campaign. Whilst General Maude was working with almost super-human energy to improve his; Army and organize the means at his disposal, Khalil Pasha at Bagh dad waving aside any idea of a successful British offensive, was reading Napoleon's Campaigns and dreaming of vast Pan-Turanian schemes. He seems tq have visualized himself as a sort of modern Tamurlane, mar ching irresistibly from conquest to conquest, as a preliminary to which he conceived a quite impracticable scheme of coming down through Persia with the 13th Corps and faUing upon General Maude ? s com munications on the Tigris. 30th September 1916.From-The Ch War Office, London, To— The Co The instructions of His Majesty's Government. The Mission Oi the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force is to protect the Oil Fields and Pipe Lines in the vicinity of the Karun river, to maintain our occupation and control of the Basra Vilayet, and to deny hostile access T3 6 an( ^ ^ 0ut ^ erl1 P ers ia- At present no fresh advance to Baghdad can be contemplated, but it is the desire of His Majesty's Government, if and when possible, to establish British influence in the Baghdad Vilayet. This further advance should not be undertaken R 2250 unless and imtii sanction for it is given, but in the meantime the General Gffieer Commanding should continue to improve the river and railway communications and maintain as forward a position as the state of his communications will allow and as can be made secure tactically without incurring heavy losses, whether caused by the enemy or by climatic con ditions. Military and political considerations connected with Nasiriya, the Muntifik andBeni Lam tribes and the Pusht-i-Kuh Bakhtiari country suggest that our present positions should be maintained if this can be achieved without undue sacrifices but we desire your views as to the feasibility of this course. Doubtless you will consult Sir P. Cox as to the effect on the Arabs of any withdrawal. Further, the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force should ensure that hostile parties do not work down south across the line Shushtar-—Isfahan. No further reinfor cements for the force must be expected. On the contrary it may become necessary to withdraw the 13th Division which was sent to Mesopotamia in order to assist in the attempted relief of Kut-el-Amara. Ends. It will be observed that it is the wish of His Majesty's Government that the force should be kept as far forward as feasible, and in this con nection I wish you to understand that so far as I am personally con cerned the proposal as to the dispositions of the force is a matter which I leave entirely to your judgment. It will also be observed that the responsibilities of the Force extend to the Shushtar—Isfahan direction, but this is not likely to make any material demand on the force. The necessity of relieving some of the white battalions by battalions from India should also be considered. With regard to feasibility of eventual advance in Baghdad direction I have informed the War Committee that in my opinion— (а) We have not got and for an indefinite time are unlikely to have available the number of troops necessary to seize and hold Baghdad. (б) For a long time to come we cannot hope to maintain them there even if we had them, owing to long and difficult communi cations. (c) In other respects their positions at Baghdad would be unfavour able in a military sense and would have no decisive effect on the war. The whole situation should be considered by you with Cox and Maude in all its aspects and your proposals should be reported with special reference to any change in dispositions you deem necessary. The necessity for being as strong as possible in the decisive theatre especially next spring should be kept in mind.251 26th October 1916. From—The Commander-in-Chief in India, Basra, To—The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, War Office, London. Concerning the role assigned to this force. An entirely passive attitude would in my judgment be unprofit able and bad for the troops. I realise fully that visions of Baghdad are beyond our sphere, and hold out no special advantages. But whilst dismissing such a project much might be done here which would enhance our prestige to a great degree, ease the supply question, and hearten the troops. Maude would deprive the Turks of the supplies coming from the vicinity of the Hai, if he were to move forward his left on to that river, and very likely would manoeuvre them out of their position on the right bank of the Tigris. Having sealed the Hai, a forward movement to Samawa from Nasiriya could be made with very little risk. From Samawa greater control would be exercised by us over all tribesmen, and confidence in our prestige and intention to stay would be greatly increased. This outline could be accomplished, I think, with insigni ficant losses, and at any rate it is fully realised by Maude that severe losses must not be incurred.CHAPTER XIX.

To realise the difficulty of operations in Mesopotamia it is neces- 1. The Port of Basra sar ^ lin ^ ers ^ an d the conditions existing at the and the Shatt-al-Arab Port of Basra in 1914 and of communication in 1914. generally. 2. There was not a single road or railway in the country between Basra and Baghdad (500 miles). All communication was by water. River steamers could ply on the Tigris to Baghdad, but flood difficulties and sandbanks complicated navigation at various seasons. Half a dozen steamers belonging to Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. were on the river, of which three carried passengers and could tow barges. One or two tugs of other owners existed as well. 3. The seaport is Basra (or rather Ashar) 67 miles from the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab (the joint Tigris and Euphrates). This river is navigable for steamers of 26 feet draught, but the Bar at the mouth limited navigation to 19 feet steamers. Steamers over 4,000 tons could only come in partly loaded and some had to unload at the Bar to ferry boats. The actual waterway is magnificent and stretches to about 20 miles above Basra. 4. In 1914 the port was entirely undeveloped. There were never more than 2 or 3 steamers in the port at a time. These were unloaded in the stream, by native lighters, and there was little port labour. For many miles the land on either side of the river was highly irrigated and consisted of palm gardens or swamp. Dry land for depots or camps did not exist, except for small patches unconnected by land and large distances apart. 5. There were a large number of native craft from 5 to 40 tons burdea, which towed and sailed up to Baghdad in 5 or 6 weeks the round trip. 6. The Euphrates river, joining the Tigris at Qurna was navigable for about 40 miles to native craft of any size, and small launches, after which the shallows of the Ham mar Lake were met, which at low' water presented considerable difficulty. After the Hammai Lake flat bottom craft could get up as far as Nasariya, and smaller vessels further still. 7. The original force of a division which captured Fao and Basra was small enough to carry on without base facilities, but the want of any space of land, and the necessity for occupying such few buildings as were available on the banks prevented any organization. Stores were dumped ( 252 )253 at various sites uncoimected save by water—and tliese were incon veniently situated. 8. The force contained no one with any experience of Port and Base organization, and subject to minor improvements and developments, nothing happened to improve matters or prepare for operations or a larger scale. 9. What was sufficient for a small force operating close to Basra, was quite inadequate when the force increased—and tried to operate tar £• field. There were neither port craft, port labour, nor wharves nor land to unload the transports, camp the troops, or receive the increased stores. Swamp land prevented any well planned lay out. 10. Nor were there river craft sufficient to maintain troops as they advanced up stream. The only big river within reasonable distance of the gulf wap the Indus, which had practically discarded river trans port. River steamers were no nearer than the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Irrawaddi. Several were sent round, but partly owing to the distance and weather, partly owing to incompetent and ignorant fitting for the sea voyage many were lost. 11. The decision to advance up river was taken without realization of the fact that every mile meant a longer round trip per steamer and a lesser average daily delivery at riverhead. 12. The advance to Ctesiphon was taken without sufficient river transport to maintain the force up river. The decision to hold on to Kut was made without sufficient transport to supply a relieving force. The 3rd, 7th and 13th divisions were moved to the front, with no ade quate means of moving them up country, of landing them, camping them or supplying them. 13. There was no drinking water except from the river. There were no camping grounds within 2 miles of the river at Basra. 14. The gradual arrival of more river steamers, generally damaged by the voyage, demanded adequate base and up-river workshops, machinery and mechanics, which required some very determined organization and energy in India to supply. But no one knew what to ask for or how to organize it. 15. There was no road metal in the country, the ground became impassable, after rain. The summer was excessively hot. The winter -wet and cold. 1.

Communications up ^ ^ . ,, 7 P till the fall of Kut. easy. Casualties were tew, small amounts ot local supplies were available, expenditure in ammunition jand field engineering stores was small.254 2. The advance to Ctesiphon however brought steamers into the most winding part of the river and every mile the troops marched by road, doubled the water communication. The stocking of the Kut base and the feeding of the troops by water was much complicated. The rivet service was quite inadequate to cater for the operation. Fortunately the repulse at Ctesiphon and the withdrawal to Kut, shortened the: communications. The advance of the Turks, and the isolation of Kut brought riverhead to Ali Gharbi to serve the advancing relieving force. 3. With the necessity of bringing more troops up the Tigris and oi reinforcing from India and Egypt, some attempt to improve mattem began. India feverishly bought steamers, but owing to bad technical advice concentrated on stern wheelers from Burma and bought a few worthless duds from the Nile. The hurrying of stores and ocean ships, to a port with no facilities to receive them was resulting in congestion at Basra which drove the shipping and commercial world wild. In April 1916, 20 loaded ships awaiting handling lay at anchor just below Basra* and yet stores were still being wired for and despatched from India. No ship was touched till 6 weeks after arrival. 4. The Indian Government were now endeavouring to make up leeway and the following measures were being taken :— (i) A port expert was sent out to plan a port. (ii) Steamers were being built in England. (iii) Indian rivers were being searched for steamers, but the poorest were generally sent. (iv) Some attempts to organize hospital steamers were being made* (v) A somewhat ineffective arrangement was made at Abadan by the A. P. 0. C. to build barges sent out in sections. 5. By the spring of 1916 more divisions were on their way from France and Egypt, and they arrived piecemeal and were sent up as best they could, without ammunition, hospitals or enough food. There* was no marching road up the Tigris and there was not enough river transport to maintain the force that was going to fight. 6. The country boats were largely required by the Army as 1st and 2nd line transport, and the Army was tied to the river side. /. A somewhat untrained Q and L. of C. staff were trying to keep things straight, but were swamped and troops were huddled to the front in discomfort and often misery. Both units and drafts shed numbers of sick into inadequate hospitals all the way to the front. 8. With the surrender of Kut and the decision to stabilize the Tigris front below Kut and prepare for a big campaign, the following main steps were put into train :— (i) Creation of port and wharves. (ii) Filling in of swamps at the Base to make a hinterland to wharves.255 (iii) Construction of a railway to Nasariya and another to Amara.- (iv) Organization of native craft service. (v) Organization of steamer service. (vi) Organization of dockyard and workshops of steamers. (vii) Erection of huts for reinforcements and details. (viii) Erection of hospitals for 40,000 men to obviate evacuation o£ lesser sick (especially sand fly). (ix) Accommodation for reinforcement officers who arrived in large^ numbers and were not required at the front. (x) Completion of a marching road up the Tigris so that troops, etc., especially mounted troops could march, with camps and water properly arranged. 1. The communications were put under an Inspector General 3. The subsequent who had under him the Directors of Inland eSStfonfatter Water Transport Railway and Works and fall of Kut. Ports. 2. The communication consisted of— {a) The main Tigris line. (6) The Euphrates line. (c) The Karun line (a small matter). 3. The line was divided into Sections as follows :— (а) Base Section under (a Brigadier). (б) Tigris.—Intermediate Sections— Qurna Amara. (c) The Advanced Section (a Brigadier). Intermediate Sections were to be interpolated as the advanced sectioni moved up with the army. Eventually Kut and Aziziya* were added- with advanced section at Baghdad extending to all railheads. Euphrates. —The Qurna Section took up to the Hanamar lake. The- Euphrates Section took rail and riverhead and all railway posts down- to the units of the Base Section. Karun. —Kun by river convoys only, direct to Karun river and thence- to Ahwaz. Amara, which for some time past had been growing into a sort of half Amara Wa ^ 1x01186 for sick w as fully organized- with:— 4 General Hospitals. 2 Base Depots. Supply Depots. Steamer repair shops. Officer's rest and leave camps. * Afterwards absorbed into the Kut sectioc.256 5. The economical use of river transport was insisted on. No boats were allowed above Sheikh Saad and all troops on Tigris front were suppli ed by convoy. Prior to that, boats had wandered up to troop camps, and been leisurely unloaded instead of turned round under authority. Sheikh Saad was developed into a complete advanced base, with a light 2' G'' line extending behind the fighting front. 6. It was soon found that the Indian Marine could not furnish officers to control a huge business river service with dockyards, workshops, pilots, stores, etc., and the War Office sent out a complete set of officers of the Inland Water Transport, to take over the river and absorb the Indian Marine Officers, who were given Military Commissions. 7. The secret of the development and control of the line of communi cation, was the absolute authority of the 1. G. C. working under the orders of the Q. M. G. over any service from Base to railheads and riverhead, and the absolute authority of the Section Commanders in their Sections over everything except through traffic and the defence troops. (It should be noted that the defence troops lodged as it were in the Sections and were maintained by the Section Commander, location, etc., being arranged between the 0. C. Defence troops and Section Commander.) 8. A system of co-ordination, between I. G. C. 'Q' Staff at the base, the representatives of the transport services, and of the despatching •departments was organized. The machinery was as follows :— (a) The I. G. C. informed G. H. Q. of his lifting capacity ex-base for ensuing decade (it was increasing weekly). In the case of the lesser lines, viz. } Euphrates and Karun the local commander sent I. G. C. their actual requirements. ■{6) G. H. Q. (Q. M. G.) told I. G. C. the allotment and the decade of the I. G. C. preferred total. Say it was 8,000 ton for the decade. The Q. M. G. would allot perhaps •Supplies . Ordnance . Ex. service stores Medical Veterinary 4,000 2,000 1,500 400 100 ic) The Directors of each service at G. H. Q. would then inform their representatives at Base of the detail to make up the allotted tonage. {d) I. G. C. Staff would then have a conference of transport and departmental representatives and allot to each the number of barges or trains that they would have put at their disposal each day. 9. An important step in securing order, discipline and sanitation and generally improving the serious state of disorganization was the issue of?rjr 257 a clear series of I G. C. circulars (i.e., Standing Orders) dealing with loading of barges, embarking of troops, water sanitation, dis cipline on steamers, breaking bulk, responsibility of stores and many other matters requiring drastic rules to be enforced by Section Commander. 10. A further step was to make it quite clear that all responsibility for all stores in transit was with the transportation authorities and sections and that Departments had only to fill train barges, etc., according to their departmental orders. This is most important as under unor ganized and amateur arrangements, departments fuss and waste their establishment at bulk breaking stations. The transportation authorities must have sufficient police and labour to see all consignments through. 11. Departmental depots must be sited by 'Q' in consultation with transportation and Departments otherwise railway sidings, barge piers, etc., will be wrongly and uneconomically placed. 1. The progress of development is worthy of study. From a small force fed by an unorganised system of stray steamers, developed a large 4. The Progress of ^ ^ by a m0dem fleet ' Iar g est river development. Marine in the World, and a carefully connected railway system. 2. At the time of the fall of Kut the Tigrislorce consisted of 3rd, 7th and 13th Divisions with 1 cavalry brigade, which gradually increased to the 3rd, 7th, 13th, 14th, and 2 cavalry brigades until the fall of Baghdad. Then were added the 15th, 17th, 18th divisions, with at least two Divisions and a cavalry brigade on L. of C. defences, with a large force of army medium artillery. 3. In 1917 the War Cabinet ordered the communications to be still further enlarged to accommodate 4 more divisions. 4. In April 1916 the Tigris Army Corps could only receive 257 tons a day—and was dependant on local scrub fuel, and local fodder, luckily growing within reach after the spring rains. But 257 tons would not feed the force let alone bring up proper stores of any kind. 5. The actual development may be described in three phases. (а) The 16-17 Preparation (б) The Baghdad Phase (c) The Mosul Advance during this development, the base extension went on continuously. 6. The development phase (a) consisted of— (i) Converting Amara into a first class intermediate depot. (ii) Construction of a marching road with camps from Basra to Sheikh Saad (adv. base). (iii) linking of Quma and Amara with a subsidiary 2' 6' railway line.258 (iv) The CGiistruction of a metre gauge line to Nasariya to supply the force there, which protected the whole flank of the Tigris Operation. (v) The organization of the fighting area from Sheikh Saad onward due to Sir S. Maude's successes and the eventual advance resulting in the destruction of the Turkish army. (vi) Hospital and recuperation depot construction. (vii) Base development. 7. In the second phase vide 5(6), after the defeat destruction and capture of a large portion of the Turkish Army in February 17, the development took the following lines :— i. Establishment of a river port at Kut and new section of L. of C. ii. Move of advanced section L. of C. to Hinaidi anj Baghdad^ (Following on a temporary riverhead at Aziziya during the advance to Baghdad.) iii. Completion of through metre gauge Basra to Amara, replac ing the earlier Qurna-Amara 2' 6' line. This involved big bridges over the two branches of the Euphrates, one near Basra, one at Qurna. iv. Construction of a 2' 6' line Kut to Baghdad, eventually turned to a metre gauge as material came forward. 8. Tn the third phase (para.5 c) came the organization of the advanced section to enable the force at and round Baghdad, now growing to seven divisions and 2 cavalry brigades, to fight the large remaining and xe- enforced Turkish Forces. This consisted as follows :— (i) Ke-organization of German standard gauge line to the upper Tigris front. (ii) Its extension to Hilla and Dibban (Euphrates). Hilla to tap the grain country. Dibban to maintain the upper Euphrates Force. (iii) The continuation of the Kut-Baghdad metre gauge to Baquba and eventually up to the Persian Frontier, also the construc tion of the great north Persian motor road, constructed with a view to extending operations as far as the Caspian. (iv) Using the 2' 6' line material to push ahead before the metre gauge material could arrive, and be brought up country. 9. The Euphrates. —During 1915, 1916 the Euphrates front was served with difficulty via the Hammar lake, at the end of which the Akaika bund had been cut to make the Akaika Channel navigable (compensation being paid to Arabs where irrigation was thus injured). The arrival of the metre gauge railway, altered the conditions, and the river above the Hammar lake was only used for local communications.259 At the same time, the large and at times threatening Arab population below Kasariya made it desirable to be able to get a steamer up at all seasons, and a channel was dredged across the lake, and a direct cut made into the upper river to avoid the unnavigable Mazlik and difficult Akaika. Troops actually moved by large steamer on this river, and some of the 15th division were transferred by water to the Tigris front in 1917, when that division moved via Baghdad to the Upper Euphrates. 10. As result of development the delivery power at beginning of 1918 —exclusive I. W. T. stores—was 2,600 tons daily as compared with 250 tons at Sheikh Saad in April, 1916. The Port development under the Port Director was at first a matter 6. The organizations reclamation of hinterland and of obtaining and development and ample timber (teak and Oregon pine) ample skilled labour, pile drivers of great power, cranes a.nd electric power to work them. 2. Three dredgers were brought from Burma and the land at Maqil was raised by dredging after the palms had been felled. 3. The Pilot service and Harbourmaster service was organized. Harbourmasters brought the ships into berths at Basra ; Arab pilots brought steamers up from the bar; a pilot brig was established at the bar. 4. Pilots and Harbourmasters took their orders from the Port Direc tor except as regards navigation and the sea discipline of the Port which was run by the Port Officer. All except the latter had army commissions. 5. In winter 1917-18, never less than 20 ocean steamers were in port and 6 or 7 left and as many entered every day and the average time of clearing was 3 days. 6. But even the large number of berths at Maqil would not .compete with the requirements of the force, and luckily 15 miles above Basra the deep channel, left the centre of the river and ran into the right bank for a space of two miles, where the bank was dry. Four more berths were built here and all the railway material and rolling stock were landed here. It was named Nahrumar. Reinforcing divisions were also landed and^ camped here—a very clean healthy locality. The disinfecting stations for demobilization were also erected here. 7. An island above Maqil was also turned into a special wood wharf and park for fuel reserves. 8. When in 1917 hostile enemy action was reappearing in Indian waters, the post at Fao was enlarged by dredging, and an examination post and supporting batteries were established. 1. This service which grew from 6 steamers and about 8 tugs in 1915 6. The Inland Water t0 ™ marine in had an Transport organizatios. ev strength of 446 steamer tugs and steam launches, 774 barges and 414 motor boats.260 2. The first development was a dockyard with basin slipways and 6,000 Chinese mechanics at Basra, and up river repair shops at Sheikh Saad and Amara, for second hand steamers need many repairs. 3. Pari jpassu went an adequate store yard and stores organization, and a large amount of port traffic craft to allow all and sundry to get about. 4. The ancillary organization demanded— (а) Proper river pilotage, pilots staying in their own sections. (б) Fuel reserves, oil and coal up country. (c) Up river piers and slipways. {d) Electric lighting of the narrows to allow night traffic. {e) Telephonic communication between Amara and Base. (/) Grrouping of steamers and tugs according to draught, many steamers staying on their own sections only. 5. At Maqil a complete construction yard was opened, manned by a military company organized by the War Office on the 'Clyde.' Here barges and tugs sent out in pieces were put together. 6. Steamers and tugs came from all over the world. 12 Thames pleasure steamers (such as Christopher Wren) came out under their own steam all the way and were splendid tugs with very well built old engines. 7. Officers of river experience came from all over the world also, an'd the control was in the hands of men widely experienced in managing such business. 8. The whole success of this campaign is due to the men and material of this service sent in by the War Office, while India, when wakened in 1916 from her lethargy did at last contribute her resources. 9. The account of this incredible marine, is best read in ' The Inland Abater transport in Mesopotamia.' (Constable) Its organization in war, its size and the force it maintained is an epic which few have yet realized. 9 divisions and 3 cavalry brigades fed 500 miles from the sea, even with the railway assistance, is a remarkable story. 1. After the crossing of the Shumran bend and the destruction of half the Turkish Army the British pursued to Baghdad. Stores at Sheikh Saad and Arab village were left for the moment. 7. Miscellaneous 5Q steamer echelons loaded from the Base followed the Army. A fresh temporary riverhead was formed at Aziziya half way to Baghdad, steamers unloaded stores and returned to fetch stores from Sheikh Saad and some from Basra. Ad vanced Section Commander moved to Aziziya. Similarly the dump at Aziziya was neglected for the time being, as troops moved and fresh echelons of steamers passed on to the Army, the dump being moved up at leisure—(Contrast ample steamers and supplies with 1915-16 situation).261 2. An interesting point for staff officers to note. The Army marching: on from Shumran to Baghdad was not full of supplies, but had enough. The Divisions and Brigades thinking they knew more than G. H. Q. were always trying to flag steamers into the shore. But steamers were working to an exact destination, and a military officer on each had written orders to take no summons however urgent or peremptory except from G. H. Q.. or advanced section Commander. These officers found it hard to obey but luckily succeeded. 3. An important point to remember. (а) R. N-. officers are not trained to handle port organization and' river marine. (б) The Indian Marine from their experience and training are also^ quite incompetent to handle a concern of any size. (c) The post of Port Officer is suitably filled by Indian Marine 1 Officers. Port Director by some one temporarily commis sioned from the Port business. (d) The organizing head of a marine should come from active business. life used to a marine or a large river—and who understands, workshop organization. (e) Port Directors and Marine must have army rank. 4. Port railways should be run by a railway officer of a railway system^ lent to the Port Director, and only taking railway orders as regards trains leaving Port station for outside. 5. 'Q' must harmonise the control of all transportation with depart ments. 'Q' is the impartial judge who sees that the difficult co-ordina tion is made with the best results to all, but except on emergency depart mental convenience must usually give way to transportation demands for sound lay out, as labour and time saving are dependent on this. 6.

Period 18th August 1916—16th February 1917. 'This period falls into seven phases :— (1) Preliminary preparations—18tli August—12tli December. (2) The advance to the Hai—13th December—16th December. (3) The first attempt to bridge the Tigris—17th December—21st December. &lt;4) Consolidation on the Hai and preparations to clear the right bank of the Tigris—22nd December—6th January . '(5) Clearing the Khadairi Bend—7th January—19th January. ^(6) Capture of the Hai triangle—20th January—5th February. (7) Clearing the Dahra Bend—6th February—16th February. N.B. —All map raferencss are to map3 13 to 19. Phase I. {28th August—12th December). This phase has been dealt with in Chapter XY. It has been shown that throughout the summer and autumn General Maude and his subordi nates, backed by the whole-hearted support of the War Office, had applied themselves to the regeneration of the force and particularly to x&gt;]ie esta blishment of sound administration and an adequate Line of Communica tion. By the end of October the administrative situation was such that the C.-in-C. felt justified in moving his G. H. Q. up to the front at Arab Village, and on December 12th he was able to telegraph to London and to Simla that his concentration on the Tigris front was complete. In order to frustrate the Turkish designs, to protect India, to regain our prestige and to utilize the large forces that were now assembled in the Eastern Theatre, General Maude had determined to assume the ^offensive at the earliest possible moment and before the breaking of the winter rains. When the great superiority of the British Forces is considered the rinducements to attack and wipe out the slur of the Kut disaster are ■ evident. The decision to do so lies to the credit of General Maude personally, for the mission of I. E. F. 'D' as laid down by H. M. Govern- rment in September had about it a distinctly defensive tenour as had the . covering letter from the C. I. G. S From the point of view of grand strategy, the question as to the rights rand wrongs of committing so large a force to a secondary theatre, is .outside the scope of this chapter. { 262 )263 8 Of a total of 150,000 men (ration strength) General Maude had concentrated 72,000 on the main front. This well exemplifies the manner in which modern war absorbs men behind the fighting line and on subsi diary fronts. Whether the 15th Division on tJie Euphrates front was an unnecessary detachment is open to argument. It is interesting to note that prior to the opening of the offensive General Maude moved his Headquarters from Basra to the Tigris front, just as General Allenby moved his Hd. Qrs. from Cairo to the Gaza front. General Maude had concentrated against the enemy a superiority of over three to one. The light railway, his transport (which included one M. T. Company) and a strong force of cavalry gave him far greater power of manoeuvre than the enemy, and to a certain degree enabled him to leave the river to which the Turk was closely tied. The courses open to him were limited. To turn the enemy's left was impossible owing to the Suwaikya Lake. A direct frontal attack on the Sannaiyat position would be very costly and from previous experience, success by such a method was doubtful. The apparent vulnerability of the Sannaiyat position to enfilade fire from the southern bank of the Tigris had not in practice proved a great weakness. The last course was to operate against the enemy's right up the right bank of the river and this was the course adopted. Looking at the problem, as we now see it, Maude's object was to destroy the enemy. Such a statement seems to be merely stating the obvious, but the more one analyses the facts the more it seems to appear that thip object was at first not dominant in Maude's mind. In one sense, of course, he was trying to defeat the enemy, and did defeat him ; but his operations in the period under review do not seem to have been made with the object of completely surrounding and destroying the force opposed to him, but rather with the less ambitious project of merely manoeuvring the enemy out his entrenched positions and compelling him to retreat. In chapter XV it has been seen that on September 30th, 1916, the British Government laid down as the mission of the force in Mesopotamia, the protection of the Persian Oil Fields, the Basra Vilayet and Southern Persia. The establishment of British influence as far as Baghdad was only to be undertaken if opportunity offered. No further reinforcements for Force 'D' could be expected and it was possible that the 13th Division might have to be transferred to another theatre. The withdrawal of the Force towards Basra was suggested. The C. I. G. S. also mentioned fchat he doubted the advisability of advancing on Baghdad. From this it will be seen that Maude was in an indirect manner assigned a defensive role. No word was mentioned of destroying the Turks opposed to him.264 It seems clear that H. M. Government were opposed to any further commitments in Mesopotamia and wished to adhere to the original object of the campuign, viz., the protection of the Persian Oil Fields. General Maude objected to a withdrawal, or a defensive attitude, and advised, as the best defence, an advance against the enemy. In a letter to the C.-in-C. India, dated October 23rd, 1916, General Skeen made the following remarks on Maude's proposed plan. 44 He (Maude) thinks he could threaten the Turkish communications on the right bank nf the Tigris and perhaps compel them to withdraw by establishing himself on the Hai without incurring heavy losses. His view is that by this plan without frontal attacks he would manoeuvre them out of their position.' Two months later General Maude's object is much more comprehen sive. It is stated in 0 0. No. 10 of 21st February—To surround and destroy the enemy by moving 3rd Corps across their rear.' In his despat hes, written after the capture of Baghdad, General Maude gives as his intentions the following :— ' to compel him (the Turk) to give up the Sannaiyat position or to extend his forces ; and lastly to cross the Tigris as far to the west as possible and sever his communication.' In none of the correspondence or documents available for examination in India has any mention been found, at this period, of an intention to cross the Tigris with the object of cutting off the Turkish forces and completely destroying them. One further point may be brought forward in support of the view that his object at fm t was to manoeuvre the enemy out of his positions about Kut with the minimum of fighting and loss, and that the conception of destroying the Turkish Army was a later development. This is the question of casualties. He had received definite instructions from the C. I. G. S. that he was nol to incur heavy casualties : and to this he repeatedly refers when communicating to the C. I. G. S. the course of the operations. This fact, added to the defensive tenour of his instructions from the British Government, to his not being able to rely on further reinforcements and to the possibility of the 13th Division being withdrawn must have weighed with him and may have caused a cautious and deliberate opera tion rather than a bold advance, which would contain an element of risk but aim at big results. The question of Maude's object at the outset has been dealt with at some length because it seems fundamental and must be borne in mind when considering the opening phases of the offensive.265 The problem tliat faced the Turk was a difficult one to solve. The The T k solution he adopted was to do nothing except to strengthen tactically the position he held on the right bank. This passive attitude though doubtless partly due to marked inferiority iDoth in numbers and armament, was mainly the result of Khalil Pasha's incapacity, his fixed ideas and his self-complacent underestimation •of his opponents. Kiazim Karabekir, the XVIII Corps Commander, was fully alive to lis dangerous position. In the actual Orders issued on the 10th Dec. 1916 (Operation Order No. 1) for the opening of the offensive, the General^Maude s intention of the Army Commander as given, is to throw forward the left of the Army and gain an •entrenched position on the Hai. While the I Corps bombarded and demonstrated against the enemy at Sannaiyat, the III Corps and Cavalry Division on the night 13-14th were to make a night march westwards and by 0600 on the 14th were to be across the Hai. The line gained was to be entrenched and wired and the Hai bridged. The III Corps was also, in the words of the Operation Order ' to pivot on its right and operate to. the north-west and to be prepared to take advantage of any weakening of the enemy which would enable us to clear the right bank of the Tigris entirely of the hostile forces. The 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division was to be kept in G. H. Q. reserve .at Sinn Abtar. Phase II. The Advance to the Hai, 13-16 December. Situation on the Tigris Front, December 12th. The Turks estimated at 20,000 with some 70 Turkish. . . guns were distributed as follows :— 52nd Division holding the Sannaiyat position between the Suwaikiya Xake and the Tigris. In rear of this position was the Suwada position from 16 a 2, 6 to 16 c 3, 4. 45th Division holding the left bank of the Tigris from the right flank of the 52nd Division to Kut. Of this force some 2,500 with 15 guns were on the right bank on the approximate line Abdul Hassan—Kut East JMounds (36 central)—Kala Haji Eahan. 51st Division were in reserve about Shumran. The Turks had two bridges, one across the Tigris at tlie Shumran bend, the other across the Hai. s 2266 The I Corps (H. Q. Sandy Ridge) held from Suwaikiya Lake to Sinn« British. Banks, the 7th Division north of the river opposite- ^ Sannaiyat, the 3rd Division south of the river. The III Corps were on the left of the Force ; the 14th Division holding the line Nasafiya Canal—Maqasis—Imam-al-Mansur ; the 13th Division, were at Twin Canals. The Cavalry Division were at Arab Village (18a). 6. H. Q. was at Arab Village. Eiver Head was at Sheikh Saad. A light railway (capacity about 600 tons per day) ran from Sheikh- Saad via Twin Canals to Sinn Abtar and Dujaila. From Twin Canals eastward protection of L. of C. devolved on the L. of C. defence. A line of barbed wire and block-houses protected the southern flanks the main menace from this direction being the Arabs. December 12th. The weather for the opening of the operations was Narrative o! fine and clear ; Tlle . recent rains ^ ad laid the Operations. dust. Climatic conditions were as good as could be desired. Certain preliminary moves took place on the evening 12-13th ; the- bulk of the 13th Division moved from Twin Canals to Sinn Abtar. December ISth—lh.Ql Corps demonstrated against the enemy positions on the left bank of the Tigris, trenches were bombarded and wire cut. Advanced G. H. Q. moved from Arab village to Sinn. At dusk the advance westwards to the Hai began. The Cavalry Division marched from Arab village to Dujaila halting there about midnight, and then moving on in a southerly direction on Basrugiya. Meanwhile the 13th Division starting as darkness fell marched on Atab. The 14th Division also moving at night formed defensive flanks to the north and south. Ill Corps H. Q. moved to Imam-al-Mansur where 2 battalions of the 14th Division were kept in Corps reserve. December 14th.—At 0600 III Corps and Cavalry Division had reached the first objective assigned to them in 6. H. Q. Operation Orders. The advance had met with no opposition and the Hai, now very low, offer- ed no serious obstacle. Dispositions 0600. T ^ e P os ^ on 0 f the force at this hour was as 14 -12-1916. follows.

I4th Division, two brigades from right of 13th Division to Maqasis one brigade on South ?ank from left of 13th Division to Dujaila.267 The line thus gained was entrenched and two bridges constructed ^across the Hai at Atab by No. 2 Bridging Train which had been attached to the III Corps for the operation. Meanwhile, the 39th Brigade of the 13th Division supported by another brigade was ordered to move up the eastern bank of the Hai. The advance of this brigade was very slow though the opposition they encountered was slight. Gr. H. Q. asked why the advance was delayed to which the reply was given that touch was lost with our cavalry on the west bank. By the evening this brigade was at Umm-es-Saad its left on the river and its right some two miles to the east. The Cavalry Division advanced during the day to about 46 d central returning for the night to Atab behind our infantry outpost line. By the evening the III Corps were on the same line as that held in the morning except for the 39th Brigade (in advance at Umm-es-Saad). There was little fighting, the total casualties for III Corps being under 200. During this day the I Corps continued to bombard the Sannaiyat position. The R. F. C. during the day reconnoitred and bombed the enemy. In the evening the Turks towed their bridge at Shumran upstream. While doing this, they were most successfully bombed in the moonlight by our aeroplanes and the pontoons cut adrift and scattered. Thus the Turks on the right bank were cut off from those on the left for the next 48 hours. December 15th. —The night li-lSth December passed quietly. On the morning of the 15th, G. H. Q. directed the left of the III Corps to move up the East bank of the Hai and the Cavalry up the West bank. Th,e advance was to be rapid, as from aeroplane reports but few Turks were believed to be south of the Tigris. Yet apparently G. H. Q. did not want an attack launched against any Turks in position, for in an order issued about 1500 the following sentence occurs ' if enemy found to be holding trenches even fairly strongly, objective may be modified.' In accordance with these orders from G. H. Q. the III Corps pushed forward towards the Tigris pivoting on its right about Maqasis. An advance of two miles was made and in the eveiling the ime rap. Maqasis— Kala Haji Fahan—Besouia—Atab. The junction of the 14th Division on the right and the 13th Division on the left was about 4'i a 8-8. During the day the flanks of these divisions had lost touch and a staff officer had to be sent forward in order to ensure contact being regained. The Cavalry Division during the day operated on the west bank and reached a point two miles west of Kala Haji Fahan where they were stopped by rifle fire from entrenched Turks. At night tliey retired to Umm-es-Saad.268 The fighting during the day was not serious the total casualties being under 200. The Turks were discovered to be holding an entrenched bridgehead on the line 36 c 8-3—46b 9*8—35 central. December 16th. —The line reached by the III Corps was some 1,000' yards from the Turkish position at its nearest point. The line reached on the 15th was consolidated and no further advance made here. The Cavalry Division made a reconnaissance towards the Shumran Bend. If General Maude's object is accepted as compelling the Turks to withdraw by threats against their communication then the steps in the plan adopted become clear—the extension of the ommen^on e flank to the Hai, the deliberate consolidation of this new line and the manoeuvres—otherwise somewhat difficult to understand—of the cavalry to tJie west. Further, if General Maude's object had been the surrounding and complete destruction of the enemy would he not have adopted a different plan ? A plan something after the style of that which General Allenby carried out at the battle of Beersheba-Gaza when the situation was somewhat similar ; a plan swifter in action, more offensive in spirit,with a greater weight at the spearhead and without so much dispersion of force. Above all, would he have indicated his manoeuvre and actually induced the Turks to strengthen considerably their forces on both banks near Shumran by the operations of the 17-21st December ? As it was, the initial movements round the Turk flank were so slow 7 deliberate, and weak that the enemy had ample time to withdraw if he had wanted to.

The action of our R. F. C. against the pontoon brigade had resulted on 15th December in cutting off the Turks on the south bank about the Hai. Their strength here w as only a weak brigade and they were confronted by a whole corps and a cavalry division. It seems to have been an ideal situation for destroying completely this small Turk Force. G. H. Q. ordered a rapid advance though they qualified this by the order issued at 1500 already quoted. This may have accounted for the slow advance of the III Corps and the stopping of our line a thousand yards from the enemy without any serious fighting.269 Would it not have been better to have attacked resolutely and cleared the right bank before the enemy could be reinforced or could strengthen these positions which had eventually to be taken by a series of slow and costly trench to trench attacks ? jphase III. The first attempt to bridge the Tigris, 17-21 December, December 17—On. this day General Maude decided to contain the enemy on the line gained to the south and east of Kut while he moved westward against the enemy's L. of C. with the Cavalry Division and part of the III Corps. His plan is laid down in the intention para, of a wire to Corps and in a wire to the C. I. G. S. In the latter the exact words are 4 4 with the remainder of the latter (III Corps) and Cavalry Division to manoeuvre westwards so as to strike enemy s communica tions.' Ifc is noteworthy that the word 'strike' is used. With this in view, during the night 17-18th the following changes occurred. (1) The 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division took over from the 14th Division on a line just south of the bend of the Tigris south-east of Kut on the left (where they were within 400 yards of the enemy), to the Pentagon on the right. The 14th Division moved south-west and held the left of the III Corps front. The III Corps extended its front some 5 miles to the west of the Hal— The piquet line ran Kala Haji Fahan—P 27—45 b 9*1 thence south-east to Hai at 59 a 4*9. Junction of 13th and 14th Divisions was about 46 c 3-6. During the 17th work was done on new roads, and bridges built at Umm-es-Saad and 47 c 8-3. December 28. —The line gained was further consolidated. The I and III Corps both carried out bombardments of the enemy trenches. In the morning the Cavalry division supported by 2 battalions of the 35th Brigade moved out towards the Shumran bend to reconnoitre and shell the bridge at 34 b 4-3 (half-way up west side of Shumran Bend). The enemy were encountered holding the nullah south of the old Pump. Some fighting occurred but casualties were light. In the evening the force returned to Besouia. The Army Commander asked the I Corps Commander, General Cobbe, for his views on the possibility of effecting a crossing of the Tigris between Sannaiyat and Maqasis. General Cobbe after careful consideration replied that such an operation in his opinion was not possible. December i(M.—The I and III Corps bombarded enemv posi tions at Kut and Sannaiyat. In front ot the latter place in270 order to induce the enemy to think that an attack in that quarter was likely. ^ Meanwhile preparations for a crossing of the Tigris on the 20th were earned oat. The following forces were concentrated by the evening west 01 Jjesouia for the contemplated operation : A.Crocker's Force. 7th Cavalry Brigade ; 40th Brigade of the 13th Division • 1 Battery ; No. 2 Bridging Train. B. Covering Force (under General Thomson.) 6th Cavalry Brigade; 35th Brigade of the 14th Division 2 Batteries. C. 37th Brigade of the 14th Division under the direct command of General Egerton was held in reserve. 3*!™ 1161(1 as hcfcre 13tli Division (less 40th Brigade) to 46 c 3-6, 36th Brigade of the 14th Division thence to the Hai The Bouthern line of defence from Dujaila to the Hai was taken over by the .L. of C. Defences. . 0 o f the 0 P erati oii as given by General Maude in a wire o He O. 1. Or. S. was ' cutting and not merely threatening them (the enemy s communications) as was previously done.' The plan was as follows :— Crocker's Force was to move at 0600 on 20th due west from Besouia until south of the Brick Kilns when it was to change direction to the north and effect a crossing of the Tigris at that place (44 a 7-1) A bridgehead was to be established and entrenched. The Force was to be rationed up to the 21st. This operation was to be protected by the Covering Force who were to move to the south and west of Shumran bend and were to shell the enemy bridge in the Shumran Bend and the shipping on the river and to divert the Turk s attention from Crocker's Force. The reserve was to be held in readiness under General Egerton. While these operations were in progress the I and III Corps were to shell the enemy trenches on their fronts and to carry out wire cutting. December 2M.—Crocker's Force were late in getting away from their bivouacs but by 0730 were outside the line of our piquets and moving west. After a march of some eight miles they turned north and about noon entered small parties of the Turks some U miles south of the rick Kilns. These parties of the enemy were weak and soon retired to the northern bank of the river. The Turk apparently was aware of our turning movement and was in position on the left bank. His force,however, was a small one, estimated at about one battalion, a section of guns, and a few machine guns271 From the river at tlie Brick Kilns a nullah, runs south and forms a covered approach. Crocker's Force moved up this covered way to reach the river but though they thus obtained a certain degree of protection against fire it had the effect of stringing out the Force to a great length on a very narrow front. The result was that only a very small proportion of the force was deployed to develop fire against the enemy on the opposite bank, and this was not sufficient to gain fire supremacy. General Crocker decided an attempt should be made to construct the bridge. One pontoon was launched but the carriers were at once killed or wounded. General Crocker who was in touch with G. H. Q. by wireless then Teceived orders not to press the crossing and orders were given to break off the attempt and to withdraw. About 1600 the Force had retired from the river and was on the march south. Some six miles were covered when, darkness coming on, the column bivouaced in the desert for the night. The majority of the horses of the Force were never watered throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Covering Force, under General Thomson, had moved out of bivouac at dawn in rear of Crocker's Force and when they had reached a point about 45 b 6*7 they struck north. At noon this force was in touch with the enemy ; the 35th Brigade on the right in square 34 d, about Old Pump and the southern bank of the Shumran bend at this point; on their left was the 6th Cavalry Brigade about 34 central. They shelled the enemy bridge and shipping and remained in this position in contact with the Turk until the evening when they withdrew to bivouac in square 46 d. The Reserve (the 37th Brigade to which two batteries were attach- Reserve e( ^ was or dered out by G. H. Q. about 1300 to support Crocker's Force. This reserve was under the command of General Egerton, G. 0. C. 14th Division, who went out with it. It halted some three hours near 45 central, and in the afternoon again moved westwards in order to meet Crocker. Touch, however, was not gained and the 37th Brigade group bivouacked for the night in the desert some three miles to the east of Crocker's Force. The casualties incurred during the day's operation were small. In a wire dated December 21st to the C. I. G. S., describing the operation General Maude says— ' In view of my instructions as to casualties, I did not feel justified in ordering crossing to be forced. Column was therefore withdrawn.' During the day our aeroplanes were active bombing Bughaila.272 December 21st. —In the morning Crocker's Force covered by the 7th- Brigade to the north, withdrew without incident to the Hai. The 3rd Division of the I Corps were ordered by G. H. Q. to reconnoitre the enemy position in the Abdul Hassan bend with a view to our line^ being advanced on this front. It should be noted that we had by now got a footing on the Tigris bank on a frontage of 500 yards at the extreme point of the Kut bend (36 c. 9-4). G. H. Q. issued orders for the strengthening of defensive works- A reserve line from Maqasis on the right to the Hai at 47 c. 9*2 on the left was under construction and the III Corps were asked to reconnoitre and start work on an intermediate line from Kala Haji Fahan to about 46v central and thence south-east. Work on roads was steadily continued. A raid by 9 aeroplanes was made on Bughaila and f ton of explosives dropped on enemy shipping and stores. GeneralMaude'sstatementto the C. I. G. S. that he could now cut the enemy's communications instead of threatening them is of great interest because it seems to bear out the supposition that his intention at the opening of the offensive was to compel the withdrawal of the enemy rather than their encirclement. The great dispersal of force is also of interest. The army was strung out over 30 miles of front. There was no general reserve and the force, detailed to make the crossing was only 1 brigade of infantry and 1 cavalry brigade. Therefore even if a crossing had been effected, there was no body- in hand sufficiently large to place across the rear of the Turk and block his retreat. The operation seems to have aimed at compelling his withdrawal: rather than achieving his destruction. General Maude's other statement to the C. I. G. R. that he broke off' the operation, and would not force the crossing because he did not wish, to incur casualties shows how the factor of losses was affecting his plans. • It is interesting to consider the possible results of -an attempted, crossing with the whole Cavalry Division and a division of infantry. With regard to details : First, the operation entirely lacked surprise. The approach march was carried out in broad daylight and the force was in contact with the enemy before the river was approached. They were therefore prepared, though very weak in numbers. Moreover it seems probable that previous excursions of the Cavalry Division had put the enemy on his guard in this direction. Secondly, the tactical power at the disposal of General Crocker was in no way fully developed. If it had been, with his immense superiority273 it would seem tliat tlie fire of the enemy might have been beaten down and a crossing affected. The technical difficulties of the bridging would of course have been very great, but at this period the river was at its minimum width and pace. The co-operation between the three forces, General Crocker's Force— the Covering Force and the Eeserve was not good owing to the flat featureless plain and the distances at which they were operating. Never theless Thomson's Force carried out its role satisfactorily and was in action at Shumran at the right time. The information of the enemy does not seem to have been very good. Possibly Crocker's Force should have been given more artillery,, guns being absolutely necessary to provide adequate covering fire; as* it was he had less artillery than the Covering Force. Phase IV. Consolidation of the position on the Hai and preparations to clear the right hank of the Tigris, December 22nd—January 6th. After the attempt to cross the Tigris on December 20th had failed General Maude abandoned the idea for the moment. In a telegram to the C. I. G. S., dated December 23rd, he gives his intentions as follows :— {a) To establish himself firmly on the ground gained. (b) To drive the Turks from their position on the right bank. (c) To harass the enemy's communications by raids. {d) To watch for any opening the enemy might offer. After the operations of the 20th the C. I. G. S. had informed General Maude that he might incur casualties up to 25 per cent. This lifted an embarrassing embargo, but other factors hampered him. Firstly^ owing to his extension of front he was finding it difficult to supply the troops on the Hai, and secondly, the weather showed signs of breaking. Accordingly General Maude began to prepare for an attack on the enemy's positions on the south bank. These operations were to be deliberate trench attacks and were to be made in two steps—the reduction of the Abdul Hasan position and the capture of the Hai bridgehead. The main interest of the period under review is the manner in which the trench line of the 3rd Division was advanced to within assaulting distance of the enemy system. Before, however, describing this operation, the general narrative will be outlined. Throughout our operations the Arabs had been a continual source Cavalry Division anno y ance 5 raiding our communications and causing troops to be wasted in large numbers on protective duties.274 Tlie chief bast, from which the Arabs operated was Gassab's Fort (62 c. 6-2) and it was decided to destroy this place. The Cavalry Division accordingly left Besonia on the afternoon of the 23rd and by a night march via Dujaila and Hill's Hillock they arrived at Gassab's Fort at dawn on the 24th. The artillery opened on the Fort at about 3,000 yards range and the Arabs in it made of! to the south. No attempt was made to surround the place. If this had been done a large number of Arabs might have been caught and a really salutary lesson inflicted. The mud Fort was destroyed, some arms and flocks and grain were captured and the Cavalry Division returned to Besouia on the 25th. The next day, owing to difficulties of supply on the Hai, they moved to Arab Village where they remained in rest camp until January 6th. During this period the III Corps carried out no operations, except for occasional short bombardments and wire cutting. The positions III Corps were strengthened, especially the intermediate line about 1,000 5^ards away from the Turks posi tions on the East bank of the Hai, to which a withdrawal was made on December 30th. On December 26th the weather, which had been fine since the begin ning of the offensive, broke and heavy rain fell; this continued till the end of the month. The country became waterlogged and the Hai rose. This accentuated the difficulties of supply, to relieve which 50 per cent, of all animals were moved to a camp near Dujaila. Meanwhile the light railway from Sheikh Saad was being pushed forward to the Hai. Preliminary operations against the Mohamed Abdul Hasan {or Khadairi) position in the Khadairi Bend, The Mohamed Abdul Hasan position consisted of two main lines. The first, starting from the disused ferry nearly opposite Kut Old Fort, ran due south to about 36 central, passing 200 yards east of Mohamed Abdul Hasan Mosque. From 36 central the line bent west to the river taking in the northern portion of Kut East Mounds. The second line Tan across the apex of the bend and was connected to the first line by communication trenches. The length of the first line was about 3500 yards. The trenches were strongly built, well sited and wired. There were a number of deep narrow water cuts that served as supplementary trenches and C. T's. Well placed machine guns flanked the front, which was also protected by gun fire from across the river on both sides. Observation from the Turkish side was unusually good for Mesopo tamia, both from Kut East Mounds (about 15 ft. high) and from the buildings in Kut itself. The ground was flat and on the north-east side was covered in thick scrub which extended for a mile south of the Tiverbank the whole way from the Khadairi Bend to Maqasis.275 Our line on the morning of the 21st December ran from Maqasis to Kala Haji Fahan, well over 2,000 yards from the enemy's position. The troops detailed for the operation against the Abdul Hasan (or Khadairi) Bend were the 8th and 9th Brigades of the 3rd Division. The dividing line between the Brigades being approximately the southern edgeof square 36-b., the 8th Brigade north of that line and the 9th Bri gade south of it. The first problem which had to be solved was the advance of our line to within assaulting distance. The method adopted might be described as flying siege work. From air reconnaissance it was not possible to ascertain the position of the enemy piquets in the thick cover in No Man's Land, but our patrols always met with enemy opposition there. On the evening of 21st December reconnaissance took place to ascert ain how far an advance was possible and the best method of advance, and on the following night, the line was pushed forward about a mile.- The method employed was to send out after dusk strong piquets closely supported. These moved on compass bearings ; distances could only be estimated by pacing. Opposition was pushed aside and the troops entrenched on what was later found to be approximately the right line, though certain adjustments were inevitable. During the next two nights the piquet line established was joined up into a continuous trench. This line ran about 700 yards from the enemy front trench, and practically on the edge of the space clear of brushwood. On the night 26-27th piquets were again pushed forward three to four hundred yards and dug in without heavy casualties, strong covering, parties being used and the rain and mist assisting. On the night 27-28th the two brigades advanced and occupied the first piquet line. The new line of outposts was now dug into a continuous trench and became the first line. This line however was not yet close enough to the enemy front line for an assault and a further advance was consi dered necessary. Owing to the proximity and activity of the Turk a new method of advance was adopted. Communication trenches with heads were constructed running forward like saps, and on subsequent nights the ends of the T's were joined into a continuous trench. This work was commenced on the night 30-31st December and completed by the morning of January 7th. The last complete parallel being about 200 yards from the enemy. The proposed assault was only to take place against the enemy's right, from the river to point K-12 (about 800 yards north of the trench bend at 36 central) so these flying saps were onl y pushed forward on the left. To deceive the enemy dummy T heads were constructed to the right. By the morning of January 7th the digging operations of the approach were over. An advance of some 2,000 yards-276 to assaulting distance had been made on a frontage of 3,500 yards in a iortnight at a cost of 350 casualties. In the process 25,000 yards of trench were dug and a large proportion of this wired in spite of bad weather, heavy rain, and active enemy opposition. The points of interest in this phase are first General Maude's plan and secondly the method of approach to the Abdul Comments. TT ... Hasan position. Immediately the attempt to cross the Tigris failed, the C.-in-C. turned to the clearing of the right bank and adopted a systematic and deliberate scheme which seems typical of him. He was now relieved of the hamper ing effect of his previous instructions as to casualties. The method adopted by the 3rd Division to approach an entrenched position is of interest, but well known on the western front. It is slow, often costly, very fatiguing, but sure. A long advance followed by attack, as at Tekrit is quicker and involves less work, but in case of failure means very heavy losses, and retirement over a long stretch of open ground before cover is reached. The Mohamed Abdul Hasan operation was really an accelerated isiege approach in which every step was consolidated consecutively, and was carried out with considerable speed and comparatively little Joss. The advance however took just over two weeks. At first the Army Commander in discussing the matter with the G. 0. C. Division .about December 27th, was inclined to consider the method too slow, and suggested a general advance which would dig in on the line gained. This was really the method attempted at Sannaiyat on April 6th. It is noteworthy however that he seems to have changed his opinion later, .as methods similar to those employed at Mohamed Abdul Hasan were used by him in subsequent fighting on the Hai. It must be remembered that it was essential that there should be no more reverses. The British Troops in the two Corps engaged had never yet had a real victory over the Turks. They had suffered the humiliation •of seeing Kut capitulate in the teeth of their endeavours, and in spite of their heavy casualties. They had undergone long periods of privation and acute discomfort, much sickness, great heat, and knew by bitter experience the extraordinary power of Turkish rifles entrenched in this terrain. Phase V. Clearing the Khadairi Bend, January 7th—January 19th. By January 7th all was ready for the assault on the Abdul Hassan position in the Khadairi Bend. On the 6th G. H. Q. had issued 1. E. F. T)' Operation Order No. 2 for the attack.far 277 The plan was as follows :— On the 7th and 8th January, general artillery activity was to take place on the whole front while against the Abdul Hassan position iDombardment was to be specially heavy and wire was to be cut. On the 9th, the 3rd Division were to carry out the assault. To divert the enemy's attention from the point of attack, the 7th Division were to shell and raid the Sannaiyat position. The III Corps were to demonstrate against the Hai bridgeheads ystem and send a force to the Shumran bend. 'The Cavalry Division were to carry out a raid on Bughaila. In accordance with the above, on the 7th and 8th the enemy were bombarded though heavy mists interfered with observation. On the 9th heavy mist covered the ground. The Cavalry who had moved to Besouia irom Arab Village were unable to carry out their raid, while the force which was to move to Shumran was obliged to return. The 7th Division and III Corps carried on their demonstration against the Sannaiyat and Hai positions. i ^ Meanwhile the attack of the 3rd Division was launched, i The artillery (36-18 prs. 6-4*5 Hows., 4-60 prs.) supported by the fire of three batteries from the 13th Division opened a slow bombardment from 0730-0830. After a pause of 15 minutes an intense bombardment was put down on the enemy trenches from 0845-0900 at which hour it lifted from the front line. At zero hour the infantry of the 3rd Division were disposed as follows— The 7th Brigade held the river front to the east of the scene of opera tions with one battalion in divisional reserve at the Pentagon. The 8th Brigade held from the river to ilf in E. Mounds (|' map), two battalions holding the line, one battalion assembled for the attack with one battalion in support. The 9th Brigade held from the left of the 8th Brigade to the river. Three battalions were assembled for the assault with one in reserve. The first objective was the southern half of the enemy front system, viz., the northern end of Kut East Mound and the trench bend about 36 central. The length of the front to be assaulted was about 800 yards. This objective was taken with little loss at 0900. Consolidation was commenced and the troops tried to extend their gains to the north and east. Obstinate fighting with bomb and bayonet took place in the heavy mist which covered the ground. At 1000 a sudden fierce local counter-attack was delivered on both Hanks ; against the left on the river bank and against the right about 36 a 9-3. After bitter hand-to-hand fighting this was stopped. These counter-attacks, particularly the one on the right were magnificently led and were executed with the greatest vigour. During the night the ground gained was consolidated.278 The next day, January 10th, the whole enemy front line system was occupied by us but the Turks still retained their hold on the second line. Turkish artillery fire in cross enfilade from the far bank of the river was effective. On the 11th it was thought that but a few remnants of Turks remained and a rather hurried attack was launched to clear the bend. One batta lion attacked on the left along the river bank, and one battalion on the right from Abdul Hassan. The attacks were separate, they were heavily punished by enfilade fire from across the river and after gaining about 500 yards were driven back by heavy counter-attacks. After this the fighting in the bend became a series of local efforts. The stubbornness of the Turk in defence was only overcome by our deter mination in the attack. Step by step he was gradually pushed back until on the night of the 18th he evacuated his last foothold and on the morning of the 29th the whole of the Khadairi Bend was in our hands. The losses of the 8th and 9th Brigades in these operations were about 1,700. This was the first occasion for a long while on which we had definitely beaten the Turks in clean hard fighting, and had completely expelled him from a carefully entrenched position. The Comments. effect on the morale of the troops was most marked. The operation itself calls for little comment except to note the success of the Turk's immediate counter-attacks, due to the quickness and deter mination with which they were launched. It is also interesting to note that the Turks themselves looked upon this battle as a very serious defeat. Mohamad Amin, a Staff Officer of the Turk XVIII Corps, repeatedly refers to it as the turning point of the campaign and as a most critical and costly reverse. A special order published by the Turkish Corps Commander states- that the steadfastness of the troops in spite of bloody losses. is above all praise. The Corps Commander kisses the eyes of all ranks and thanks them.' P hase VI. The Capture of the Hai Triangle, {i.e., East of the Hai and South of the Tigris.) On the expulsion of the Turks from the Khadairi Bend, General Maude immediately turned to the problem of clearing the Hai. Preliminary measures for this operation had already been carried out. As in the case of the Abdul Hassan attack, the first phase of the operation consisted in pushing forward the trenches to assaulting distance. This was done between January 12th and January 22nd.279 To divert the enemy's attention from the point of attack, the Cavalry Division on January 22nd was sent north of the Tigris to move round the Suwaikiya marsh and threaten the enemy's L. of C. Owing to the waterlogged state of the ground they were unable to carry out tJiis manoeuvre. The attack was to take place on January 25th and was to be a delibe rate trench-to-trench attack, the first objective being the point of the salient at P. 15. The force in front of the III Corps was estimated at 20 Battalions (11,800 rifles) and 51 guns which included troops on the left bank of the Tigris but not those east of Kut on the north of the Tigris. The garrison of the Hai Triangle was put at 3,700. The assault was to be carried out by the 39th and 4:0th Brigades of the 13th Division up both banks of the Hai, each Brigade on a 900 yards front. The attack was to be supported by the fire of 66—18 prs. 28—4-5 hows. 8—60 prs. and 2—6 inch hows. The southern flank of the III Corps from 46 central to Atab was held by the 9th Brigade, attached for the purpose. The 25th broke fine and clear and after a short bombardment the attack was launched at 0930 hours and the front line captured on a front of some 1,800 yards. On the west bank the Turks made four succes sive counter-attacks and drove us back. (Our casualties approx. 1,100). The next day, the 26th, the attack was continued, the 14th Division operating up the West bank and the 13th Division up the East. The front and second line trenches were captured on a front of 1,800 yards. These initial successes were extended by bombing and artillery fire until, by the end of the month, the whole Turk front line system was in our hands to a depth of a thousand yards. The Army Commander wired the Corps Commander that he wished pressure on the Turks to be maintained because the latter was shaken and to prevent him 4 4 striking a desperate blow in another direction, say Sannaiyat.' On February 1st a fresh attack was launched. On the west of the Hai it was carried out by the 36th and 45th Sikhs on a 500 yards frontage. These two battalions were heavily counter-attacked and a simultaneous bayonet charge by both sides took place in the open. Our losses on this day were over 1,000 mostly amongst these two battalions. On the night 1-2nd February the troops were re-distributed. The 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division took over east of the Hai and the 13th Division concentrated at Besouia. On the 3rd the attack was continued by the 8th Brigade and the East bank of the Hai completely cleared. During this day the Cavalry Division operated towards Shumran and the 13th Division came u.p on the left rear of the 14th Division.£bo Trie next night the 4th—5th February the Turks evacuated the Hai position and took up a new line from the Liquorice Factory to the Shum- ran Bend at Yusifiya. The casualties we incurred in these operations were about 3,700. Throughout, the weather had been fine except for some rain on the night of January 31st. Phase VII. Clearing the Dahra Bend—February 6th to February 16th. On the expulsion of the Turks from the Hai Triangle, General Maude at once began operations to reduce the enemy's new position in the Dahra Bend ; this done, the right bank of the Tigris would be virtually clear of the enemy. The new position occupied by the enemy ran from the Liquorice Factory to the Yusifiya bend of the Tigris and thence along the Nahr-al- Massag. According to our contemporary intelligence estimates the enemy forces at this time were distributed as follows :— Dahra Bend 6,500 rifles and 14 guns. About Kut and Shumran .... 1,800 rifles and 46 guns. Simmran (exclusive) to Bughailah . • • 900 rifles and 6 guns. Kut to Sannaiyat 1,000 rifles and 6 guns. Sannaiyat 3,000 rifles and 19 guns. T otal . 13,200 rifles and 91 guns. February 6th to February 8th was spent in p/eparations for the attack tm the new position. The 14th Division held from the junction of the Hai and the Tigris for a mile to the west; the 13th Division thence to within about a mile of the bend of the Tigris at Yusifiya with a defensive flank to the south and west. On the morning of the 9th the attack was launched in fine weather by the 38th Brigade against the centre of the enemy's position about the L in Liquorice (|' map). The enemy front system was captured on a front of 1800 yards and several counter-attacks repulsed. The Cavalry Division operated towards Shumran but effected little. Next day, the 10th, the Liquorice Factory was taken by the 14th Division. During the ensuing four days, the enemy were completely hemmed into the Dahra bend and pressed back to their last line, some two miles in length across the curve of the river. On February 15th the 111 Corps delivered a final assault on this posi tion which was completely successful. Except i'or a strip of land on the river bank, held gallantly by a small body of the enemy, the whole bend fell into our hands and nearly 2,000 prisoners were captured. During281 the night, the remnant of the Turkish torces on the south bank evacuated and on the morning of the 16th the whole of the right bank up to the Nahr- al-Massag was in our hands. On the 15th the weather which had been threatening broke and heavy- rain fell, turning the country into a quagmire and rendering movement difficult. The efficient counter-battery work by our guns contributed to the success of this last operation and saved the infantry many casualties. Our losses during the Dahra bend operation were about 1,000. While the III Corps were engaged in driving the Turk from the ilai and the Dahra bend, the I Corps had been holding the front from Sannai- yat to the Hai. Except for occasional bombardments and demonstra tions nothing had occurred on this front. The wide extension, however, had caused the Army and Corps Com manders a certain amount of anxiety, for there was a possibility of the enemy making a desperate counter-attack. A secret evacuation of the •Sannaiyat position had also to be watched for. On February 8th General Cobbe was again asked to consider the possibility of throwing a force across the river about Bait Isa, but he did not favour the idea. It will be remembered he had been against a similar proposal put forward by the Army Commander in December. During the latter part of January and in February the enemy force in front of the I Corps numbered approximately 3,000 at Sannaiyat and 1,000 on the river front. Certain general comments on these operations Comments. , ,, . suggest themselves— (1) The intention of the Army Commander was to clear the south bank of the Tigris. The plan adopted was a methodical reduction of •enemy positions in each bend of the river in turn from east to west. This had the effect of stretching the Turk forces out on a dangerously long front, their left being held fast at Sannaiyat. It also stretched our own line, but this was less dangerous, as although the enemy had interior lines, he had no railway, his communications were much inferior to ours, our strength was greatly superior, and in order to make a penetrating attack he would have to cross the river—an operation for which he had not the means at his disposal. (2) In view of the costly nature of these trench operations the length of time necessitated thereby and the opportunities of retiring open to the enemy, it is interesting to consider the possibilities of an attack by the III Corps and the Cavalry Division when the offensive opened in Decem ber ; an attack against the enemy on the right bank, based on surprise und pressed with vigour. General Marshall adopted step-by-step trench-to-treuch attacks? on a small front. These attacks were generally carried out by two t 2282 brigades, two battalions only in each brigade assaulting ; that is to say the assaults were launched with only one-sixth of his force. Owing to^ the small frontage of these attacks the enemy were able to concentrate to repel them. Would it not have been possible to have attacked on a wider front against both sides of the Hai Triangle and driven in the salient at one blow I It mu»t be remembered that no Tanks were available and the reason General Marshall was so decided in confining himself to 'nibbling' tactics was probably lack of artillery. He had, however, the Divisional Artillery of two divisions jplus some Army Artillery. The lesson is the old one. Trench systems, even those likely to be met in semi-open warfare, cannot be taken without very strong artillery or other mechanical support. This forces upon one the question, in a war in the Middle East shall we in view of the shortage of tanks find ourselves under-gunned ? (3) Surprise. During this period the factor of surprise was not made use of,, strategically or tactically. (4) Time of the Assault. The time of the assault was generally 0930 hours, sometimes battalion^ did not go over until noon, owing to mist. Would it not have been better to have attacked at dawn or in the mist ? (5) Counter Attacks. The splendid resistance put up by the Turk was largely due to hi&amp; immediate counter-attacks. It is evident that these were always made on the initiative of the local commander, and they were marked by great vigour, skilful use of circumstances and very gallant leadership. (6) Counter-Battery Work. This improved enormously during this period. At the opening of the offensive the value of counter-battery work was not fully realised^ Compare the bad counter-battery work in the Khadairi Bend operation with the successful counter-battery work carried out in the clearing of the- Dahra Bend. (7) Morale. In view of the circumstances it is remarkable how the high morale of the lurks was maintained : but a gradual deterioration therein (c/., the Khadairi Bend and final clearing of Dahra Bend) is noticeable as is the distinct improvement of our own. (8) Arabs. Little has been said about the Arabs though they had a decided effect on the operations. It must be remembered that their presence on the southern flank caused a whole brigade to be immobilized and used up further troops in defending the L. of C.283 (9) Cavalry Division. With the exception of the raids carried out on Hai Town and Gassab's iort, it is hard to say what good resulted from the peregrinations of the cavalry. It seems that the numberless reconnaissances carried out by the whole division could have been performed more efficiently by a squadron. Very little use was made of the special characteristics of cavalry in considerable force and of their great superiority to the enemy mounted troops. (10) Tanks. It is interesting to consider what the effect would have been if General Maude had possessed an adequate force of Tanks. In this terrain there is nothing to stop tanks except the river. On the other hand it must be remembered that on this flat ground tanks would be most conspicuous and would offer good targets. Smoke could have been used, and conditions were favourable to it especially up till 1100 in January and February, but the withdrawal after assault and the selection of safe rendezvous might have presented difficulties. On the whole it would seem that tanks would have had an overwhelm ing effect. (10) Air. The incalculable assistance given by the K. F. C. in the matter of reconnaissance, photography and artillery spotting may be compared with the lack of these facilities during the spring attempts to relieve Kut. A stronger Air Force could doubtless have done even more, but the extraordinary effect of even one good squadron of up-to-date machines is outstanding. (12) The Turkish Plan. Even when the Dahra Bend had been taken, Khalil thought the XVIII Corps could hold the British and he still adhered to his wild scheme in Persia and to the turning move through Luristan. He continued to underrate his enemy and to disregard all representations of the perils of his position. The holding of the positions on the south bank had been ordered by Khalil against the advice of Karabakir.CHARIER XXI. General Maude's Advance. The Shumran Crossing. (Eeference maps 16, 17 and 18.) On February 15th the Army Commander had intended to continue the operations in the Dahra Bend. The few remaining Turks were to be cleared from the Nahr-al-Massag and Imam Mahdi on the right bank by a mixed force under General Egerton while the 1st Corps attacked Sannaiyat. Torrents of rain fell during the night 16th-17th February, turning the whole country into a quagmire, so General Egerton's operations- had to be abandoned, but the Sannaiyat operation held good. The enemy strength was estimated at 10,300 and 91 guns. 3,000 of. these and 19 guns were at Sannaiyat. All the orders for attacking the position had been issued previously,, and a short operation order was all that was now required. Zero was fixed for noon. The 21st Brigade were to deliver a surprise attack without preliminary bombardment on a two battalion front.. They were to capture the first two lines on a front of some 350 yards, while the 28th Brigade contained the rest of the enemy's position on the right. The 19th Brigade, in reserve, were to go through the 21st Brigade as soon as they were consolidated. The attack was to be supported by all the Divisional ^nd Corps Artillery, mostly in enfilade across the river. Owing to the mud and slippery trenches the 21st Brigade were not ready and zero had to be postponed till 1400. The Division issued a final warning against the dangers of mud clogging rifles and machine guns and at 1400 the attack began. The two assaulting battalion secured their objectives and maintained themselves there for 1| hours while the 19th Brigade was coming up preparatory to going through. Accurate shell fire, however, combined with a strong counter-attack pushed along the river flank was too much for them. The artillery were unable to check the enemy. A panic set in on the right and by 1630 both battalions were back in their front line, considerably disorganised.. There was no hope of renewing the attack. The trenches were very slippery and blocked with troops trying to distribute bombs and equip ment. This, of course, should have been done already. This reverse cost as 500 casualties and the Turks about 400. It is worth while pausing here to consider the situation from the Turkish angle. The failure of our attack on Sannaiyat on February ( 284 J285 17th must have tended to confirm Khalil's conviction as to the stability of the Tigris front. As has been previously mentioned, he had been maturing a wild scheme to bring the XIII Corps from Persia to cut Maude's communica tions between Shaikh Saad and Amara. He was so obsessed with the idea of his own superior strategy and the Napoleonic blow he was about to deliver on Maude's communications., that he starved the XVIII Corps of reinforcements and neglected the warnings of Kiazim Karabekir Bey (Commander, XVIII Corps) as to the impending offensive. The latter was a most capable soldier who maintained the morale and fighting efficiency of his force in the face of every disadvantage. Khalil Pasha, moreover, totally failed to make any defensive plans for covering Baghdad and even neglected to maintain the five separate positions between Aziziya and Baghdad that his metre far seeing predecessor Nur-ed-Din had constructed in 1916. The result was that when Karabekir Bey was forced back irom Kut there was not one single position adequately prepared where he could rest and reorganize his tired troops. The attacks in the Dahra Bend and at Sannaiyat had cost the X\ I1I Corps some 3,000 casualties, while only about 600 men and 5 guns an reinforcements had been received during the last month. The effective strength of this Corps was now down to between 9,000 and 10,000 men. Our offensive awoke Khalil to what might happen, but he failed adequately to grasp the situation and still clung to his Persian scheme. It was not till about February 16th that he realized the imminence of the danger and ordered the XIII Corps back on Baghdad. In addition there were the Mth Division and the 37th Regiment (strengths about 3,600 and 1,600 respectively) who were coming down from the Caucasus to reinforce the 6th Army. These too had been diverted to Persia as part of Khalil's great plan. They were now ordered to concentrate on the Tigris front. But it was too late. The snows in the mountains and Baratoff s force prevented their concentration in time to save the situation and only small portions ot the available force arrived, quite insufficient to influence events. The Turks had other difficulties. They were short of gun ammuni tion, and drafts only arrived at about half their nominal strength. Large proportions deserted on the way. One report states that a certain ' unit ' is coming down but the ' Battalion Commander has deserted. This gives a sidelight on the Turkish morale behind the firing line. It is interesting to compare what actually did happen with what might have been the case had Khalil listened to Karabekir Bey, and concentrated instead of dissipating his force.286 He could have had the XIII and XVIII Corps of about 10,000 each. Besides these the 14th Division and 3Tth Regiment together with the garrisons of Baghdad and Feluja would have given him another 10,000 men. With 30,000 men he might well have blocked our advance ; probably about Kut where the Sannaiyat defile was so strong ; but, if not, then further in rear, thus shortening his own communications and lengthening ours. As it was he had barely 10,000 men with the XVIII Corps, some 3,000 in and around Baghdad and driblets arriving from the XIII Corps and 14th Division. He had no defensive positions in rear and it was only on the 16th February that he ordered a portion to be commenced along the Dry Channel east of Imam Mahdi. To return to the narrative. The interval between the 18th and 21st of February was spent in preparation. The Illrd Corps was to force the crossing at Shumran on the 23rd February. The 1st Corps was to renew the attack on Sannaiyat that was to precede the main crossing The weather was fine again,,but th^ river was rising rapidly, making bridging operations difficult. In the Illrd Corps the 13th Division had taken over all protective duties to allow the 14th Division to concentrate and practice crossing operations. Rowing was carried out daily across the Hai and large numbers of men were trained. This crossing is an operation of great interest and deserves study in detail. It was to be made on the following lines :— There were to be three ferries. Each ferry was to have 13 pontoons and a complement of volunteer rowers, with ample reliefs. Volunteer rowers were drawn from the Hants, Noriolks, 128th Pio neers and Sappers and Miners. The Bridging Train (No. 2) and the pontoons were to move up from the Hai and be hidden close to the position chosen for crossing. The 14th Division were to cross covered by the 13th Division while the Corps Cavalry and the Cavalry Division were to guard the left flank west of the Nahr-al-Massag. The crossing was to be covered by elaborate flanking barrages from all divisional and Corps Artillery. The 14th Divisional Artillery would be on the Nahr-al-Massag protected by the 39th Brigade. The 40th Brigade holding the north end of the Shumran Bend was to keep down hostile fire by rifle and machine gun fire. The 38th Brigade was to be in reserve, while the 9th Brigade was to take over its old piquet287 line from Old Pump House to Atab, protecting the scene of operations trom Arab activities and any raid by Turks. The actual crossing was to be carried out by the 37th Brigade who supplied their own covering party. The Norforks were to cross at No. 1 Ferry, the 2-9th Gurkhas at No. 2 and the l-2nd Gurkhas at No. 3. As soon as a bridgehead was established the 36th Brigade followed by the 35th Brigade were to cross by ferry, or by the bridge if the latter had been completed. Meanwhile the I Corps were preparing to renew the attack on .Sannaiyat 6 hours before the crossing at Shumran. Sannaiyat was bombarded daily to reduce the alertness of the enemy with false alarms. These bombardments showed that the position was .still held in strength. The Corps Commander thought the enemy might be made to feel •anxious about his left flank on the marsh, so he brought up 2 battalions in broad daylight and proceeded to advance the strong points on his northern flank to convey the impression of an impending attack. This manoeuvre hardly seems subtle enough. The 7th Division now had the 19th Brigade in the forward zone, the ^Sth in the central zone and the 21st in Eeserve. To distract attention from the main crossing the 3rd Division were to carry out a raid across the river at Maqasi; aftel 1900 on the evening before the real affair. This was a most interesting and successful little operation extremely well planned and executed. 20 pontoons and a complement of rowers from No. 1 Bridging Train were allotted. These with the selected party of the 27th Punjabis practised crossing lower down the Tigris. They found it took 15 minutes to do the round trip across 330 yards of river, which was approximately the distance at the main crossing point. On the night of the 22nd the crossing was effected, Turk trenches on the far bank rushed, their occupants killed or captured, and the return journey with prisoners, •captured machine guns, etc., successfully concluded at a very small cost in casualties. It was found on the 21st February that the river was still too high und the 14th Division were not ready. Thereupon General Cobbe wrote to General Maude suggesting he should attack at Sannaiyat thirty hours before the crossing to give more time to draw enemy troops from the main enterprise. The •General Officer Commanding concurred and the Sannaiyat attack was timed for 0600 on the 22nd February followed by the Maqasis raid during the 22nd-23rd February.288 On 22nd, the 19th Brigade attacked successfully under a barrage,, its left on the river and the 28th Brigade containing the enemy on the right. The plan was for the 19th Brigade to take the first two lines. As soon as they were consolidated the 28th Brigade was to come up level with them while the 21st Brigade came up from reserve to our old front line. It was a regular set-piece attack supported by guns about evenly divided between the right and left banks. (34 on the right, 33 on the left.) Great reliance was placed on enfilade fire from the right bank to prevent Turkish counter-attacks. For this purpose the machine guns of the 8th Brigade were also used. The infantry were to go over in waves, the first three pushing on to the second line while the remainder held the first. They were to have- bombing, clearing, mopping-up parties, etc., and be covered by all the Machine Gun Companies of the Division. The second phase, that is the advance of the 28th Brigade on the right,, was to be carried out on similar lines at a zero to be notified later. All troops were to be ready by 0600 but this was postponed later till 1000, when the two leading battalions reached their objectives without much difficulty. About 1230 a heavy Turkish counter-attack developed along the river-bank and drove the Indian battalion here back to their old front line. They were very gallantly rallied by their Commanding Officer,, while the Turks were suffering heavy casualties from enfilade fire from Crofton's Mound, and retook their positions in the enemy's front two lines. At 1515 the Corps ordered the second phase. The 28th Brigade got in but were heavily counter-attacked on their right. They maintained their positions and that night we held the first two lines at Sannaiyat. There are one or two points worth noting about this attack. Firstly, it is curious how often we intended to attack at dawn, yet zero was postponed till later. This is not good for the morale of troops just waiting to go over the top. Secondly, the wave formations, long lines of men at intervals. The lessons from France had not yet been appreciated in Mesopotamia although it was 1917. Turkish artillery was however certainly far weaker than German. Thirdly, although this was an attack with a limited objective, well supported by artillery, the experience of April in regard to the Turk counter-attacks was repeated. Enfilade fire along the river did not stop289 tliem, nor were we able to stop tlie counter-attack on the 28tli Brigade,, in spite of the fact that the enemy was seen massing for it and we had ample warning. It shows the fighting quality of the Turks: and the difficulties of bringing fire to bear with accuracy when observation is poor. That night the III Corps were making their final preparations. The Tigris was going down, but still running about 6 knots. During the night the 39th Brigade pushed out to the Nahr-al-Massag to cover the 14th Divisional Artillery. The Bridging Train came up and the 37th Brigade with their pontoon parties moved up in three columns towards the ferries. Just as they started at dusk a Turkish plane flew over, but apparently saw nothing. While these moves were going on the 40th Brigade were distracting the Turks at the Liquorice Factory by another feint, including much splashing of planks and movement of transport carts. This feint combined with the raid at Maqasis had the desired effect. The enemy evidently concluded Maqasis was a hoax and the Liquorice Factory the real thing, because at dawn a column was seen moving towards it from the scene of the real crossing. The night was quiet and all were ready by 0500. At 0530 all three ferries started launching their pontoons and a quarter of an hour later the first two moved off. The Norfoiks at No. 1 got across safely, seized quickly a portion of the river bank just as the light became sufficient to see a hundred yards or so. The Turks were now roused and heavy fire was opened. The 2-9th Gurkhas were crossing at No. 2 Ferry. Here 10 pontoons out of 13 succeeded in reaching the far bank : of these 4 more were knocked out on the return journey. The six remaining attempted another crossing,, but every occupant was killed or wounded before they reached mid stream. The l-2nd Gurkha Rifles at No. 3 suffered the same fate. The position on the left bank was now for some time precarious, but the footing gained was maintained and extended, thanks to the magni ficent performance of the Norfolks and the Gurkha detachment. Out of the two Gurkha Battalions about one and-a-half companies had got across before the ferries had to be closed down. The remaining pontoons, were then brought up to No. 1. No. 1 Ferry worked well and by 0920 all the Norfolks were across and the 2-9th Gurkhas started to follow. The Norfolks with some of the 2-9th Gurkhas now held the toe of the peninsula whilst a party of the l -2nd Gurkhas was holding on some 700 yards north-east. They were still held up by machine guns parti cularly from a concealed nullah on the right of the latter. Our artillery were unable to spot these but by 1300 the l-2nd Gurkhas managed to advance a little and capture the nullah. Resistance then began to-290 r slacken and the enemy tried to counter-attack down the centre of the peninsula but were broken up by our artillery which gave excellent cross covering fire and most effective support throughout the day. The last battalion of the 37th Brigade started crossing at 1400 and the 36th followed by the 35th Brigade was brought up in readiness. The bridge had been begun at 0720. The 36th and 35th Brigades crossed that night, while the 38th Brigade came up to the bridge to be ready in emergency. Not only were the difficulties of bridge construction very great in the strong current of the flooded river, but all day the Turkish Artillery endeavoured to destroy it by shell fire, and special precautions had to be taken against floating mines. By 1630 however, in spite of all diffi culties, the bridge (over 1,000' long) was complete. On I Corps Front while the crossing was going on the 7th Division were expected to push on and occupy the third and fourth lines at San- naiyat. The 19th and 28th Brigades advanced as before, the latter without much trouble, but the 19th were held up by strong opposition. It was not till 1730 that they gained their objective and linked up with the :28th Brigade. The Army Commander intended the 7th Division to push on vigor ously to prevent the Turks weakening Sannaiyat so as to give III Corps a better chance of cutting off the enemy. Obviously it was essential for the 7th Division to maintain pressure and push on as early as possible. However no move was made till 1330. There is no doubt that considerable numbers of Turks withdrew in the interval. In fact a large column of 4 to 6 battalions were seen moving west from Kut towards the Dahra Barracks in the afternoon. Why the 7th Division did not push on further when there was only one line left to capture is also hard to explain. Orders for next day's operations were for vigorous action on the part of all to bring about decisive results. The 14th Division were across the river. The 37th Brigade on the left and the 36th on the right, some 1,000 yards south of the enemy's forward position. The 7th Division preparing to attack the fifth and last line at San naiyat (the 21st having relieved the 19th Brigade) lightly equipped. The Cavalry Division leaving their bivouacs at Besouia were to ^rendezvous south of the Shamran Bridge at 0600. At 0615, preceded by an intense bombardment, the 14th Division -commenced its attack on the Dahra Barracks—Dahra Eidges Position. The Dahra Eidges make a position of some strength, the banks of .ian ancient canal giving good cover and about 20' of height for observa-291 tion. The Barracks were one-storied buildings stretcliing three-quarters of the distance across the top of the Bend. The 36th and 37th Brigades advanced over some 3,000 yards of bare plain without a check. The enemy withdrew from his advanced position, but put up a stiff fight on the main line particularly on both flanks. By 0715 the 36th Brigade (on the right) reached the Barracks leav ing a gap on their right between them and the river. The 37th Brigade (on the left) also got on to the Kidge, but in doing so left a similar gap on their left. The 35th Brigade were now sent in to fill this latter gap, supported by fire from the Corps artillery across the river. This brigade made its way up the west bank of the Bend in face of considerable machine gun fire from the numerous ruins, eventually forming up with the 37th Brigade about 1100. Meanwhile the Turks massed twice to counter-attack the left of the 37th Brigade but each time were driven back by artillery fire from the right bank, and finally started retiring. General Head Quarters orders to the Cavalry Division were ' Cavalry Division is to cross bridge immediately and take up vigorous pursuit along left bank in direction of Bughaila Ack. addressed Cavalry Divi sion—1st Corps 3rd Corps.' This order, though despatched at 0215 on 24th from Advanced General Head Quarters, was not received by the cavalry till they reached the bridge at 0910. Their original orders had told them to rendezvous some 4 miles south of the bridge and await further instructions. They reached the rendez vous and at 0645 got further instructions telling them to go to the bridge. They arrived there at 0900, and at 0910 got the order to cross. They moved off with the 7th Cavalry Brigade leading along the west bank of the Shumran Peninsula. North of the small Fort (marked in 34 b) they were stopped by machine gun fire near the 35th Brigade who were also trying to advance. They searched for a passage and later about 1100 began to cross through the enemy lines by the Dahra Bar racks followed by the 6th Cavalry Brigade. The Turkish rear guard was now beginning to retire. At 1150 III Corps Head Quarters received a message from the R. F. C. that some 1,500 Turks with guns were moving west across the top of the Shumran Peninsula. This movement was also plain to the troops in the Bend, including the cavalry. Later at 1300 another report came in to say that the enemy were taking up a position along the Dry Channel (square 23) with some 1,500 men and 6 guns, while large bodies of infantry and some cavalry were seen retiring 10 miles up the Baghdad road.232 The 7th Ca valry Brigade seems to have moved about two miles north of the Dahra Barracks, and then wheeled to the left, while the 6th 'Cavalry Brigade did the same about a mile in rear. The two brigades were therefore only just in front of our own infantry and were soon hung up by the enemy position along Dry Channel. This was the position Khalil had ordered to be dug at the last moment. It was naturally strong, but it did not extend very far north, and could easily be turned, nor was it any way properly prepared and there was no wire. Whether the Cavalry Division tried to turn it or not is not known. Anyhow by 1500, four hours after passing through our infantry, both brigades were reported to be heavily engaged in a dismounted attack supported by ' S ' and ' V ' Batteries, Royal Horse Artillery. The enemy had apparently been reinforced and were now some 2,500 strong with 23 guns. Although a couple of armoured cars got close up to the position, the cavalry division was effectually held up for the rest of the day and retired at 1800 to bivouac near the fort in 34 Its casualties this day were negligible. On I Corps front, while the 14th Division were attacking the Dahra Barracks—Shumran Ridge Line, the 7th Division continued its advance against the fifth line at Sannaiyat as soon as the 21st Brigade had relieved the 19th who had suffered many casualties the previous days. At 0435 on 24th the 28th and 21st Brigades moved forward and •occupied their objective with little opposition. At 0830 General Head Quarters told I Corps that III Corps were on the Dahra Barracks line and consequently little opposition was to be expected. They were ordered to piish on vigorously to the Suwada position. The 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division were to form a defensive flank along the southern edge of the Suwakiya Marsh as the advance pro gressed. The 7th Division did not start advancing till about 1000 on 24th :and by 1200 reached the Suwada position. South of the river the 3rd Division were ordered to come up to the line Guwam—Imam-Al-Mansur. The 9th Brigade was to continue holding the line from the Old Pump House to Atab guarding the left flank, while the gunboats came up to Guwam. The situation that night, 24th-25th February, was— III Corps— 4th Division.—Dahra Barracks—Shumran Ridge. Artillery across the river west of Shumran Bend.293 13th Division.—Concentrating near tlie Fort 346. Artillery partly north, partly south, of river. Cavalry Division.—Bivouacked near the 13th Division. I Corps— 7th Division.—28th-21st Brigade, Ataba Marsh—Guwam, 19th Brigade, Nukhailat, 8th Brigade (attached) from Ataba Marsh to north end of Suwada position. 3rd Division.—(Less 8th Brigade), Guwam—Imam U1 Mansur, 9th Brigade, Pump house—Atab. During the three days' fighting from February 22nd to 24th losses liad been heavy on both sides. The Turks had already lost 2,250 in the Dahra Bend operations while at Sannaiyat on February 17th he had lost another 400. Before we crossed the Shumran his estimated strength was down to 9,200 w T hile few reinforcements were likely to arrive. On February 24th part of the 64th Regiment, leading the 14th Divi sion, reached Bughaila, but the rest only came up in time to hold the Diyala. On our side during the three days the— I Corps lost .......... 1,350 III Corps lost ......... 1,400 T otal . 2,750 At Sannaiyat the I Corps captured 70 and counted 640 dead. The enemy must ha ve lost there at least ..... 1,400 The III Corps killed and captured at Shumran .... 1,600 T otal . 3,060 Hence out of the 9,200 of the XVIII Turkish Corps it is unlikely that more than 6,200 started the retreat to Baghdad. (1) The outstanding feature of these operations is of course the suc cessful crossing at Shumran, which is likely to Comments. , . • , i mi, • • , become an historic example, ine mam points ifco be noted are :— (^) The site selected, allowing of converging covering fire, and of rapid extension of a bridge-head with secure flanks. The defence was in the salient. The point selected was as distant as possible from the Sannaiyat position to which the enemy N\ere tied down. The conformation of the ground denied the enemy effective observation. The site of the bridge being two miles from the Dahra Ridges.294 (b) The thorough preparations beforehand. Ample allowances. for spares and casualties (over 800 rowers were trained). (c) The extreme secrecy. General Maude dealt direct with the R. E. officer in charge. No one else knew the exact plan. (d) The effective feints involving a genuine attack at Sannaiyat, an actual crossing at Maqasis, and a dummy one at the Liquorice- Factory. (e) The simultaneous crossing by 42 pontoons just before daylight , at three different points, thus dividing the enemy's atten tion. (/) The excellence of the technical arrangements both of artillery and engineers. (2) In spite of the success of the crossing more than 20 miles in rear of Sannaiyat, the major portion of the enemy force avoided capture. The reasons for this appear to lie in the slowness of the 7th Divisions and the failure of the cavalry. (3) By the evening of the 22nd, i.e., the day before the Shumran crossing, the 7th Division was in full possession of the first two enemy lines at SannaiyWfc. This success was not followed up till 1300 on the next day, so that it was 1730 on the 23rd before we were in occupation of the third and fourth lines, with only one line of the enemy still in front of us. In view of the fact that the bridge was across at Shumran and the 14th Division now crossing uninterruptedly, it would seem that whatever may have been the reasons for the twenty four hours delay in carrying the third and fourth lines, immediate action against the fifth line was imperative. It is urged that the relief of the 19th Brigade was essential. But General Fane had in hand two perfectly fresh brigades, the 21st of his own and the 8th of the 3rd Division placed under his orders. Yet the fifth line was not occupied till after the Turks had evacuated it early on the 24th. Pursuit was not commenced till after 0900 on that day. The result was that the enemy had disappeared. (4) The Cavalry Division began crossing the Shumran Bridge at 0910 on 24th. It was not till after 1100 that they commenced passing through the 14th Division about two miles north. After that their action is inexplicable. The Turkish retreat was passing across their front only two or three miles distant, and in fact actually visible at times. Yet no attempt was made to move to the north. Indeed no use was made of their mobility at all. As soon as they were clear of the infantry, both brigades wheeled to the left, dismounted, and remained in this position for the remainder of the day.295 The War diaries of these formations give the impression that they were trying to outflank the enemy, and were heavily engaged in trying to do so. It is hard to reconcile this with the facts. Only some 2,500 Turks were holding the Dry Channel; their flank therefore could not have been far to the north. The total casualties of the 6th Cavalry Brigade on this day were 2 killed and 6 wounded. The casualties of the 7th Cavalry Brigade are not given but would presumably be even less, as they came into action later. The slowness of the cavalry, their passivity, and failure to employ mounted action with vigour is inexplicable. An inspection of the ground, and an appreciation of the situation from a Turkish point of view, would seem to show that the cavalry should have been directed towards the north-east corner of the Shumran Penin sula and not toward the north-west. Had they moved in this direction there was every chance of their getting through. Boldly handled their action might have been decisive.( 298 ) CHAPTER XXIL The advance to the Diyala and the occupation of Baghdad. Reference map 19. The capture of Sannaiyat by the I Corps and the crossing at Shumrart The advance to the ^ the 111 P ut an end t0 the P rololl g ed P eriod of Diyala, February 25th trench warfare with its mass of detail and regu- to March 6th. larity of supply. On February 25th the Tigris Force concentrated and proceeded to follow up the Turk. In the future it was to be open warfare with its attendant difficulties- of supply and maintenance. Up to date the I Corps had been fed direct by river from an Advanced Base at Shaikh Saad, and the III Corps by a 2' 6' line to Atab. From now onwards the whole force was to be dependant on a moving riverhead and animal transport. Turkish Rear Guard 115 was known on F e bruar y 25th tliat tlle Actions to Imam enemy were retiring on Imam Mahdi. Orders had Mahdi. been issued for the whole force to push on. The Cavalry Division, starting at 0600, were to operate round the enemy's northern flank to the line of the nala running due north from Shaikh Jaad (209—215 central). Ill Corps. —The 13th Division, with its artillery from the right bank and the Corps Cavalry Kegiment attached, was to pass through the 14th Division and advance along the river bank on Shaikh Jaad. The 14th Division was to concentrate in the north-west corner of the Shumran Bend and follow the 13th Division, while the I Corps was ta dear the battlefield and form up in rear of III Corps. During the night 24th—25th the enemy withdrew and touch was temporarily lost. He was now reported holding the line of the nala&amp; running north from the bend Umm-al-Ajaj with an advanced position- along a small ncda about the 2nd S in Alqayat-ash-Sharcjiya. He was reported to be about 2,000 strong supported by 23 guns of all calibres. The 13th Division moved at 0600 covered by an advanced guard of the 38th Infantry Brigade and the 66th Field Artillery Brigade. They bumped into the advanced position at 1000. Some 500 Turks retired, and they oftntinued the advance till 1230 when they were held up by the mair position. The Brigade were then ordered up to attack the left of the position.297 Meanwhile the Cavalry Division had delayed starting and were behind the Infantry. They should have moved at 0545 but were unable to get their rations and did not get off till 0645. Even then they were very slow, and although their role was to operate round the enemy 's north flank, they kept close to the river, tho 6th Cavalry Brigade leading. This brigade came into action north of the 39th Infantry Brigade and got involved. The 7th Cavalry Brigade was ordered up on the left thus merely prolonging the right of the 39th Brigade. At 1430 as no progress had been made the Cavalry Division got peremptory orders from General Head Quarters to break off the attack and make for Bughaila Bridge. By now, however, they were so involved that it was 1730 before they could extricate themselves and the Turks by then had started withdrawing. The Cavalry did the same, going back to bivouac near the 2nd S in Alqayat-ash-Sharqiya. During the afternoon the 39th Brigade began to make their attack felt and by 1600 reached the nala in places, the 40th Brigade coming up in support on their right rear. The enemy suffered heavily leaving 300 dead and 340 prisoners. However they had checked our pursuit and inflicted 450 casualties. Both our brigades bivouacked in their battle positions. That night the I Corps had reached their positions on the arc of a circle from the south-west corner of Ataba Marsh to Atab, while the 14th Division and the III Corps troops were in the Shumran Bend. Next day (the 26th February) the pursuit continued. The III Corps reached Bughaila with little opposition, while the Cavalry Divi sion went on as far as the Nahr Kellak, but dilring the night again lost touch with the enemy. Supply difficulties were beginning to make themselves felt. On the 27th the Cavalry went to Aziziya, but finding it held by 2,000 Infantry and 10 guns they retired. The III Corps came ap to the Nahr Kellak and the I Corps to Shaikh Jaad. By now the ration situation was bad. The 7th Division had eaten their emergency ration. The animals had no rations and it was only by the arrival of two motor launches and a camel convoy, enabling half rations to be issued, that the situation was saved. The difficulty was the winding Tigris and the time it took to bring up supplies from Shaikh Jaad. The round trip from Arab Village to Shumran required eight hours. On the 28th February the Cavalry Division found Aziziya unoccupied but they were obliged to retire to Nahr Kellak on account of the supply situation. On the 1st March, however, they were able to occupy the place while the gun-boats also came up to Aziziya. u 2298 There was now a lull in tlie operations to organize tlie Line of Com- munication and await furtlier orders from Government. From March 1st to 4th inclusive the Tigris Force remained halted as follows:— Navy, Cavalry Division and R. F. C. at Aziziya. 3rd Corps, east and west of Aziziya. 1st Corps, at Shaikh Jaad. (Less units temporarily left on L. of C.) The outstanding feature is the timidity of the Cavalry, ana their remarkable reluctance to leave the infantry or to use mounted action. They had in front of them a tired beaten enemy, who had suffered heavily and had nearly 200 miles to go before he could be supported effectively. The country was admirable for cavalry work, especially of an extended nature. The only reason alleged is that they were held up for rations. Compare the cavalry in AUenby s pursuit in Palestine. General McAndrew got his rations from the Turk. The pause in operations were not entirely due to the fact that the force had outrun its supplies. Apparently the War Cabinet and War Office had been nervous of a repetition of 1915. They were disinclined to risk another advance on Baghdad unless success could be guaranteed. This time they were determined to make certain there would be no loss of prestige even at the cost of slow movement. Consequently they had not given General Maude a free hand to push on as he pleased. They had been emphatic on the point that four Divisions and a Cavalry Division was the minimum force capable of holding the Baghdad Vilayet. Prior to his operations round Kut, it appears that General Maude must have corresponded with the War Cabinet on the subject and doubted his ability to maintain such a force at Baghdad with the transport then available immediately after a break-through had occurred. On February 27th, however. General Maude wired to the C. G. S., India, stating that the reversion to river-transport had temporarily dislocated his L. of C. but he expected to be able to move in the course of a few days. He hoped in the interim to get instructions from His Majesty's Government for a further advance against a beaten enemy who could only reach Baghdad as a disorganized mob. The C.-in-C., India, forward the gist of Maude's telegram to the C. I. G. S. pointing out that it appeared time to take risks and endure privations to gain the full benefit of victory. He emphasised the value of Baghdad both from the military aspect as the main base of all Turkish forces ia Persia and Iraq, and from the political side as to the prestige it would give us in the country and in all other Mahomedan spheres as well.^99 He said tliat Army Head Quarters, India, considered Maude under estimated his present resources and he would easily maintain six Divi sions and a Cavalry Pivision with the transport he now had. The above wire crossed one from the C. I. G. S. to the C.-in-C., India ? modifying the War Cabinet's previous instructions and stating that the policy of H. M. Government was to hold the Baghdad Vilayet subject to the security of the force. He again laid stress on the point that op no account must a future retirement be contemplated. He suggested that as he was in touch with the Grand Duke, who expected Baratoff to move in four to five weeks when the snows cleared, it might be safer for Maude to wait until he could co-operate with the Russians, particularly as Baghdad would be difficult to hold in the flood season when the whole country could be inundated from the north and north-west. Meanwhile he put forward the possibility of a cavalry raid on Baghdad. On March 2nd Maude again wired to the C. G. S., India, that the Turks had evacuated Aziziya and the road to Baghdad seemed open. On the 3rd the C. I. G. S. wired to the C.-in-C., India, hoping that the War Cabinet had given Maude wide enough instructions. Next day he wired to Maude direct saying that they had not under stood in the first instance that his victory had been so complete. They now left the future conduct of affairs to him with a warning not to overdo things and instructed him to get in touch with the Russians. Conse quently by March 4th General Maude was again at liberty to act. At this interval after the event, it is easy to appraise more dispassion ately the factors against further commitments in Iraq. The pursuit could not stop at Baghdad. To hold Baghdad it is essential to hoJd strongly positions on the three approaches about 60-mile distant. This must mean a considerable number of troops and a very great extension of L. of C. services. Was this the most profitable way of employing our resources ? Would it cause the Turk to concentrate against us a force at least as big ? As a fact we know that it had no such result. Indeed from the Turkish point of view their Iraq Army was for the next 18 months one of the best possible examples of a useful detachment. With a force in the neighbourhood of 50,000 men all told, they caused us to maintain in Mesopotamia a ration strength nearly ten times as great. The drain on our shipping resources cannot be so easily expressed. On March 4th Maude stated that he could now maintain 4 Divisions and a Cavalry Division. He considered it vital to mc ve on Baghdad at once, because the old Turkish Army had ceased to exist. A new one would take a long time to form and we should be able to reach the city300 with little opposition. If we did not, it would adversely affect the tribes and cause trouble on our L. of C. He placed little faith on Russian help, but as his force was equivalent to seven or eight Turkish Divisions he felt no fear on that score, nor on his ability to cope with the floods. He now intended to resume the advance on March 5th or 6th when the supply situation was definitely assured. The C. I. G. S. fully concurred and suggested holding Falluja—Sakhla- wiya—Yahudiya-Daltawa—Baquba^—Istabulat and Delli Abbas to guard against the floods. Accordingly on March 5th the following moves took place :— Advanced Gr. H. Q. came up to Zor. Ill Corps came up to Zor. I Corps— 7th Division came up to Aziziya. 3rd Division came up to Sharaqi—Umm-at-Tabul (Less 9th Brigade on L. of C.) The Cavalry Division moved on towards Lajj where they were to camp. On the way, the E. F. C. and armoured cars reported the enemy digging just south-east of Lajj and a column of about 600 men retiring north-west. There was a violent dust storm blowing as the Cavalry Division advanced. It was preparing to halt when this modified, and the oppo nents to their mutual surprise found themselves within rifle range of one another. The Turks quickly recovered, manned the trenches, aDd. held up the Cavalry. The 7th Cavalry Brigade attacked frontally while the 6th Brigade tried to work round the enemy on the north-west, but this flank was thrown well back. Our Cavalry had to withdraw to half way between Lajj and Zor. Next day the advance continued without opposition. Newly-dug lines of trenches were visible at both Lajj and Ctesiphon. That night— The Cavalry Division leached Bawi. Ill Corps reached Ctesiphon. I Corps— 7th Division reached Zor. 3rd Division reached Aziziya. Crossing the Diyala The folknv;i ^ ^ March 7th ' the Force and the entry into closed up on Bawi and found the enemy holding Baghdad. ^j ie ^ ne 0 £ Dry a | a .301 Before going into the details of the crossing it is as well to review the change that had come over the Turkish Army, the possibilities of their defending Baghdad and the Eussian situation. The left bank of the Tigris was littered with the debris of a routed army. Since February 22nd the Turk XVIII Corps had lost 63 of their 91 guns. We captured 33, the remainder had been thrown into the river. They had lost 4,300 prisoners, all their bridging train, 3 supply steamers, the old H .M.S. Firefly and a quantity of rifles, M. Gs. ; ammunition, S, A. A. and equipment. G. H. Q. estimated that only 5,000 men and 28 guns at most had got back to the Diyala and they looked on the road as practically open. They realized that Khalil had made desperate efforts to concen trate troops at the last moment. They knew that the rest of the 1 ^ th Division and the 37th Eegiment were arriving. The 6th Division of the XIII Corps might arrive and the ISoth Regi ment from the Euphrates together with the garrisons of Falluja and JBaghdad would be available. From Turkish sources, available after the war, it appears that on Khalil's arrival at Baghdad he could dispose of about 10,000 men and 46 guns in the neighbourhood of that city. From the Turkish point of view Khalil was guilty of two main faults. The first was his failure to withdraw the XIII Corps in time to defend Baghdad. It seems doubtful if this could have been accomplished easily, because that Corps was in touch with the Russians, and snowed up in the Persian Hills by the exceptionally heavy snowfall that winter. The second was his failure to make positions in rear for the XVIII Corps to fall back on and his neglect to maintain even the five positions originally constructed for that purpose by Nur-ed-Din. Apart from these two main errors, there seems no doubt that Khalil lost his head when he might have made better use of the time and forcefe still left him. Three days after we crossed the Tigris, Khalil withdrew his Head quarters to Baghdad informing the XVIII Corps Commander that he did not intend to stop this side of Samarra. Next day he repented and ordered Karabekir to halt at Aziziya and fight it out. This order was impossible, so Karabekir Bey disregarded it and continued his retire ment to Lajj and Ctesiphon where he halted for several days preparing a position, while the Army Commander decided what to do next. Khalil had no plan and it was only as an after-thought, due probably to our inability to continue the pursuit, that he determined to defend Baghdad. His indecision wasted several valuable days. According to the Turkish account, if Khalil had made judicious use of the short respite given him and co-ordinated a system of defence on the line of the Diyala with orgarized inundation of the surrounding302 country, there was no reason way he should not have been able to hol^ up our advance for some time with the force he had at his disposal. His total strength during the fighting for the city must have been between 11,000 and 15,000 on the Diyala alone. As it was, he failed to inundate the country and his force was unable to hold a sufficient frontage to avoid its flanks being turned. The Diyala and the Khar (or Mahsudiya) Canal are the only two ob stacles of any importance guarding Baghdad from the south and south west. Except for numerous irrigation channels and some small mounds the surrounding country is dead level, requiring extensive field works and a large force to give it any adequate protection. On the right bank, during the flood season from March to May, the whole country between the city and the Diyala can be flooded by cutting the bunds north of the town, while on the right bank, by opening up the irrigation channels from the Khar canal, a large traet on the west and south-west can be made impassable, thus reducing the frontage to be defended to a narrow strip on the west of the Tigris. The Euphrates at Falluja is about 24' higher than the Tigris and commands most of the country in between. Turkish Strengths on March 7th, 1917. ]. During the retreat from Kut the 14th and 45th Divisions of XVIII Corps were me T ged into the 51st and 52nd Divisions. 2 According to our estimates— Rifles. Guna. XVIII Corps—G. H. Q. estimated 5,000 rifles and 28 guns reached the Diyala .... 5,000 2S 14th Division arrived between February 26th and March 3rd 3,600 Remainder of 11th Regiment arrived Mamah, 5th- 7th 1,100 37th Regiment arrived just after 14th Division . 1,600 44th Regiment strength not given arrived from XIII Corps, say . . . . . . 1,600 T otal . 13,900 28 In addition—There were reserve artillery and the garrison of Baghdad—Falluja consisting of 2,200 rifles and 160 sabres, 1,300 being recruits and 200 Gendarmerie. According to Turkish estimates. (Mahomed Amin)— On March 10th in the final attack- Rifles. Sabres. Guns. On Right bank 5,000 200 30 On Left DanK . , . . . I 3,700 300 18 Total . 9,200 He states that the 44th Regiment had lost 1,000 casualties alone, bringino: the total! to 10,200 exclusive of losses elsewhere.303 On the left bank, by sinking boats and damming the Diyala about 20 miles up stream, it is said that a great deal of the country east of the Diyala and Tigris can be inundated and thus a turning movement from the east or north-east prevented. These inundations would have taken the best part of a week to make a good obstacle, but if Khalil had decided at once on this course he would have had time. He would then only have had to watch the line of the Diyala for some 14 miles, while on the right bank he could have held a line from Tel Aswad—Tigris with a main position in rear which, with the help of the Khar Canal, could have watched from Umm -at-Tabul to Tel Ataf right up to Lake Aqarquf, thus effectually guarding its right. Both of these positions would have been well protected by the inundations. The Khar Canal is a good obstacle 25 yards wide, 30 feet deep, with- steep banks. No concerted plan was adopted. When Karabekir Bey returned from Aziziya against orders, he was told to prepare a defensive position at Ctesiphon, while the 14th Division that had now arrived prepared- the line of the Diyala with a supporting position in rear from Tel Mahomed to Qarara. Khalil neglected the right bank for the left because he wished to keep communications open with the XIII Corps, hoping that it might arrive from Persia in time. A short defensive position was begun on the right bank from the Tigris to Umm-at-Tabul, with local labour. Khalil then changed his mind and decided to hold the Diyala and a much longer line from the Tigris to Tel Aswad on the right bank. Accordingly the Umm-at-Tabul fortifications were abandoned and some three miles of trench started near Tel Aswad. When Karabekir Bey returned and was shown what he was to hold with the 52nd Division numbering some 2,300 men, he told the Army Commander that his force was insufficient to take up such a long line. He pointed out that the enemy could easily pin him down on the Diyala, transfer the bulk of their forces to the right bank and occupy Baghdad from the west. Hence the right bank was the dangerous one and it would be better to hold the shorter Umm-at-Tabul line. Accordingly work on the Tel Aswad position was abandoned and. recommenced at Umm-at-Tabul. By now it was too late as our forces were on the Diyala and neither position was complete. In Persia the Russians started to follow up the rear-guard of the XIII Corps on March 3rd, west of Kirmanshah. The C. I. Gr. S. told. General Maude that the Grand Duke had ordered Baratoff to push on to Khanikin. He thought that the 6th Turkish Division might escape,.304 but lie thouglit that General Maude might be able to cut off the 2nd _Division in rear and join up with the Russians. The 6th Division got away but only reached Baquba and were unable to help in the defence of Baghdad, except for the Mth Regiment which was the only unit from the XIII Corps present at the Diyala. Thus on March 7th when the Tigris Force arrived on the Diyala the Turkish dispositions were :— XIII Corps withdrawing on Khaniqin, 6th Division leading. 64th and 156th Regiments arriving from Falluja and the Euphrates. 37th Regiment arriving from Baquba. XVIII Corps and the Mth Division on the Diyala and the Tigris right bank. The dispositions of the XVIII Corps are shown on the map. The pontoon bridge over the Diyala had been dismantled and towed up stream. The old wooden bridge had been destroyed and stringent orders issued by the 51st Division that all material was to be withdrawn to the right bank of the Diyala. A few pontoons, however, were forgotten by the 44th Regiment and the Turks attributed our initial crossing to this mistake. This was not so, as we used our own pontoons. While 2 battalions of the 44th Regiment and the 3rd and 2-64th Regiments were holding some 10 miles of the Diyala river front with posts on the left bank, the remainder of the 51st and 14th Divisions were preparing the Tel Mahomed iine. On the right bank the 52nd Division, assisted by local labour, were improving the main line of resistance from the Tigris to the Decauville Railway at Umm-at-Tabul and thence north towards Tel Ataf. The 43rd Regiment with part of the 37th Regiment were holding Tel Aswad—Tigris as a forward line to give the defenders time to com plete the main position in rear. The bulk of the artillery was on the Karrada Peninsula or between the Khar Bridge and Tel Ataf. Ill Corps Headquarters were at Bawi. The 13th Division leading marched up to the Diyala. A special reconnaissance showed both bank? were held. The Advanced Guard 38th Brigade, 66th F. A. Brigade and a portion of No. 2 Bridging Train under General O'Dowda tried to move up the bank by daylight, supported by fire from the gunboats and 13th Divisional Artillery but without success. In spite of technical advice to the contrary after R. E. reconnaissance General O'Dowda decided to cross the Diyala that night. The 35th Brigade were to be ferried across the Tigris to support the .crossing by enfilade fire from the right bank near Shaikh Aswad. This brigade with a Field Company and one battery, R. F, A., was known a s Thomson's Force.305 After crossing, it finally marched off at 1330. No enemy were met tut the bad road and the irrigation channels stopped its progress and it did not reach Shaikh Aswad till noon the following day. During the evening of the 7th the Turks from Daraidir and Diyala villages retired across the river and at midnight the 38th Brigade Tvitii its pontoons attempted the passage. The river was some 120 yards wide with a current of about 2 miles per hour. It was thought that the Turks would retire, but this was far irom being the case. There was nearly a full moon at the time and immediately the first pontoon was launched, intense rifie and machine gun fire broke out. The crossing party were driven back with a loss of 50 killed and 3 pon toons. At 0400 the attempt was abandoned and the force retired 2 miles south. A good example of how not to attempt to cross a river in face of oppo sition. No proper reconnaissance, no thorough organisation, no cover ing fire, no feints, no alternative crossing places. Time, however, was of great importance and this fact justified to .some extent what was attempted. During the day the I Corps Headquarters and the 7th Division reached Bustan and the 3rd Division came up to Zor. The Cavalry Division reconnoitred 14 miles up the Diyala but finding it held throughout returned to Bawi. As a matter of fact the enemy only held the southern ten miles ? thence north for another fifteen miles they were only protected by the 33rd Cavalry, total strength 250 sabres. The 36th Brigade were also sent up the Diyala to the Police Post (about six miles from the mouth) with the idea of crossing that night. They found the river held in strength for five miles, so they were told not to commit themselves but to take advantage if a crossing was effected lower down. While these manoeuvres were going on No. 2 Bridging Train was ■constructing a bridge across the Tigris at Bawi. The Turkish air reconnaissance was good. It kept them accurately informed of our movements. They had several new planes and a com plement of German mechanics in Baghdad. The plan of operations was now as follows. According to the I Corps Order No. 26, based mainly on air reports, the enemy were supposed to be holding the Diyala lightly : they were not expected to hold Baghdad. There were some trenches on the right bank covering the city bat they were not held, while a force of some 300 cavalry and 600 infantry had been seen moving up the Mahmudiya — Baghdad road due at the latter place on the 11th March.306 The Cavalry Division were to cross at Bawi during the day and make a night march on Baghdad so as to arrive at the city by daybreak on the 9th. The Cavalry Division were to be followed by the 7th Division who were to join up with the 35th Brigade (General Thomson's Force). The 3rd Division was to move up to Bawi preparatory to crossing later. The 36th Brigade with one battery, one company, Sappers and Miners, and only two pontoons were to cross the Diyala that night and turn the left of the Tel Mahomed—Qarara positions. The 38th Brigade in conjunction with the 35th Brigade (across the Tigris at Shaikh Aswad) were to renew the attempt near the Diyala mouth, after an intense bombardment at midnight. As soon as they were across they were to take up a covering position east of Dadawiya until a bridge had been built and the rest of the 13th and 14th Divisions could follow. The Turks heard from their air reports that the Cavalry Division followed by possibly two divisions were about to cross. They realized the threat to their right flank and altered their dispositions. The 64:th Regiment and a German M. G. Company of the 156th Regiment (6 guns) were ordered to Tel Ataf. The remainder of the 37th Regiment were sent to the 52nd Division, while the 51st Division less the 44th Regiment were ordered to stand by to cross to the right bank, leaving the Diyala to be held by the 14th Division plus 44th Regiment. However our attack here on the night 8th—9th prevented the move of the 51st Division for the time. The 38th Brigade starting crossing soon after midnight, but the arrangements for crossing and for covering fire were still far from satisfactory. For a short time under a heavy bombardment the ferries were able to work. A hundred men of the Loyal North Lanes, crossed and started forming a bridgehead before the pontoons were knocked out and ferrying ceased. The 44th Turkish Regiment launched no less than 5 attacks against this little detachment who were holding a small semi-circular bend in the river bund (not more than 50 yards across and 25 yards in depth) with palm groves and houses in close proximity. This natural bastion had a command of 5' or 6' over the ground outside. In these attacks the 44th Regiment was practically annihilated largely by S. A. fire, but our artillery on the left bank were also most useful. The Turks seeing the gravity of the situation, ordered up the rest of the 51st Division (7th and 9th Regiments) to eject the Loyal North Lanc&amp;. by counter-attack along the river bank from the old bridge site. By then it was daylight.307 The ground was flat and swept by fire from botli banks. They decided to postpone the attack till dark and try to prevent us by gunfire from reinforcing our detachment in the meanwhile. The Loyal North Lanes, detachment had 60 casualties during the twenty four hours. Higher up the 36th Brigade also failed to get to the river bank. As the main attempt had not succeeded they were told not to try .again. Later in the day the 37th Brigade relieved them, as they were without water. On the right bank the Cavalry Division had been delayed firstly by finding the 7th Division near the bridge and later by the irrigation channels on the right bank. By daybreak they were within sight of Karrada Island and shortly after came up against the right of the Tel Aswad Position. They engaged the enemy until, the 28th Brigade leading, the 7th Division arrived, when they worked west to outflank the enemy. They thought the enemy were retiring but they soon found he was only swinging back his right to a line running north-west; namely towards Umm-at-Tabul. At 1115 the Cavalry Division retired to water the horses as they had been without water for 24 hours. The 28th Brigade attacked frontally with 1 Battalion, sending two others round to make a wide detour and come in on the left. The 19th Brigade came up and prolonged the left of the 28th Brigade while the 35th Brigade from Shaikh Aswad, with orders to advance on the Khar Iron Bridge, came up on the right of the 28th Brigade. Late in the afternoon the Cavalry Division came back and took up their position on the left of the 19th Brigade, eventually withdrawing -at nightfall to Shaikh Aswad. Apparently they had no effect on the day's operations and they left the flank of the 7th Division in the air. The enemy were still holding their advanced position and were estimated at 4,000—5,000 rifles with 30 guns (10 being heavy). They had however been forced to weaken the Diyala front because, as the attack west of the Tigris developed, they abandoned the hope of driving out the Loyal North Lanes, bridgehead with the rest of the 51st Division that night and brought it over to the right bank. The 7th Division and Cavalry Division had been definitely held up with a loss of some 600—700 casualties. The Army Commander was not pleased with the state of affairs on the right bank nor with the paucity of information he had received. He could not make out what the situation was nor why a further advance Ixad not been made. On the left bank the situation remained unchanged.308 During the night 9th—10th the remains of the 44th Eegiment made one final attempt to eject the Loyal North Lanes, but that failed with heavy loss. British Dispositions. The situation therefore on the night 9th- 10th March 1917. lOth. was :— On the right bank— Cavalry Division— 7th Division and 35th Brigade from Hielawiyin right to left. Brigades in battle positions. 35th Brigade on river bank. 28th Brigade on river bank. 19th Brigade facing north-east. Head Quarters, 7th Division and 21st Brigade, Shawa Khan. Opposed by about 5,000 Turk rifles, 200 Sabres and 30 guns. On the left bank— 13th Division— 38th Brigade, Diyala, with 100 men across. Eemainder of Division between Diyala village and Bawi. 14th Division— (35th Brigade with 7th Division). 37th Brigade relieving 36th Brigade and right flank up Diyala 3rd Division— Concentrating at Bawi. Opposed by 3,700 rifles, 300 Sabres and 18 guns of the Turks- (Turkish accounts put their own casualties on the Diyala up to 9th inclusive at over 1,000.) The III Corps had issued orders for the Diyala crossing to be carried but by daybreak on the 10th. The Turks were now in a bad way on this river front. Our threat on the right bank had forced them to withdraw the bulk of the 51st Division during the night 9th—10th March. Only the 44th Regiment was left to guard the crossing with one battalion of the 3rd Eegiment on their left in touch with the 33rd Cavalry. The 44th Eegiment had lost over 1,000 men in the last two days and practically all their officers. Their morale was gone. These two regi ments were really only holding a chain of posts along the river bank while the rest of the 14th Division were still improving the Tel Mahomed position in rear. The 38th Brigade (^s Wiltshire Eegiment) were able to ferry across the Diyala. that night with little opposition and managed to get two battalions over by 0600. They took 200 prisoners mostly from the309 iith Regiment and consolidated a bridgehead while the remainder of the brigade crossed and a bridge was completed. The 37tn Brigade, who had relieved the 36th Brigade during the night, also started crossing nearly due east of Tel Mahomed but as they only had 4 pontoons progress was very slow and only 2 battalions were across by daybreak next morning. The bridge at Diyala mouth was ready by 1030. The 39th Brigade followed by the 40th crossed and the advance on Baghdad began with the 39th Brigade leading. West of the Tigris the 7th Division with the Cavalry Division on their left were to push on to the railway station and encircle the city from the north-west. But in view of Gr. H. Q. instructions issued late on the 9th they were to stand fast unless the enemy retired, in which case they were to push- on vigorously. At 0515 patrols reported the enemy withdrawing and at 0740 the 7th Division informed the Corps that they were pushing on in the direc tion of the Khar Iron Bridge to Baghdad. The Cavalry Division meanwhile moving on towards Tel Ramal. The Turks had not retired. During the night they withdrew from the Tel Aswad position back to the Tigris—Umm-at-Tabul—Tel Ataf line. Our 35th Brigade on the river flank was still opposed by some of the 37th and 43rd Regiments who were not yet back, while air reports stated that there were still many Turks and 16 guns between the 7th Division and Iron Bridge (Khar). As the advance proceeded the 19th Brigade closed into the right with its right flank along the Decauville Railway next to the 35th Brigade. The 28th Brigade was squeezed out and came back to Divisional Reserve. There was no fighting except intermittent shelling and rifle fire,, patrols were working well forward trying to get touch with the enemy new line. The Cavalry Division was also continuing to close in, in the direction of Kadi, Tel Ataf and Kazimain. At 0900 a dust storm started and by mid-day it was so thick that visibility was under 50 yards and operations were at a standstill. It was decided to stand fast and resume the attack at 2300. The 19th Brigade were without water. Their transport went to the river but lost itself in the storm. Communications were interrupted and reading between the lines of the War Diaries, probably no one knew where anyone else was. The situation however was rather worse for the enemy. Khalil and his Staff with the XVIII Corps Commander and his two Divisional Commanders were watching the progress of events from the Khar Pavi lion near the Iron Bridge over that channel.310 This was an excellent 0. P. with about 35' command giving a view of the country for miles round. When they saw our encircling move the 51 st Division (7th and 9th Regiments) were ordered up on the right of the 52nd Division to protect the gap between Tel Ataf and Umm-at-Tabul. They saw that the 35th Brigs de was hung up on the river flank. Then the dust storm began to obscure movements. For a long time they saw our Cavalry Division slowly moving north-east from Tel Ramal so slowly thai they were uncertain whether it was cavalry or infantry. As the column worked further north threatening the railway and Kazimain it become evident to our Turks that there was danger of their retreat being cut off. A German Staff Officer was in favour of the 51st Division making a counter-attack against this flank. Khalil agreed but the Corps Commander pointed out the futility of such a course with the numbers in hand. Eventually it was agreed that only if the column turned out to be cavalry should a counter-attack be launched. It was then about 1500. The dust storm was at its height and communication with the left flank was difficult. Khalil heard that we were gradually working round the left of the 14th Division in the Tel Mahomed position. The bridges over the Tigris were broken by the •storm and it was impossible to reinforce that flank even had he had the troops to do so. The position was hopeless. At first Khalil was in favour of stopping where he was and fighting it out. Kiazim Karabekir pointed out that if he did so the 14th Division and the 2 divisions on the right bank would be driven back into Baghdad and surrounded ; if not that night, at all •events next morning. Under the circumstances he advocated retreat. Khali! finally ma de up his mind to adopt this course and at 2000 issued orders for tlie retreat. Everything was in great confusion made worse by the storm. Still it is most remarkable how well the Turks with all their handi caps and in face of our greatly superior numbers, especially of cavalry, •succeeded in this most difficult night withdrawal from close contact with our troops, All the stores that could be destroyed were burnt including 7 new aeroplanes just arrived. The retreating Turk Divisions got on the move about 2300 but were forced to halt for 3 hours while the Supply Train moved on. Eventually at 0200 on 11th March they started again for their destination, 19 miles north of Baghdad. At 2315 patrols from the 35th Brigade found the Turkish trenches on their front empty and started pushing on along the river. The 19th Brigade were so exhausted after their long day without water that theThe Mouth op the DIYALA (1923). looking N. up-stream. Site where L.N. Lancashires made their stand indicated by point of arrow-head. I {to face page 15 Chap. XXII,) &lt;*0 N311 21st Brigade had to be sent through, them to prolong the left of the 35th Brigade. The Black Watch reached Baghdad station by 0550. By this time the whole of the 7th Division were advancing along the main road ia rear. The Cavalry occupied Kazimain with the 6th Brigade. The 13tii Hussars policed Baghdad while the remainder of the division camped on the right bank. On the left bank our patrols occupied the Tel Mahomed position at 0230. The 13th Division advanced and camped at Es Salekh leaving two battalions to garrison the city. The 14th Division concentrated just north of the Diyala Bridge while the 3rd Division (less 7th Brigade on the south-west sector of Baghdad) remained at Bawi. COMMENTS—(1) The inactivity and slowness of the cavalry and their reluctance to move wide is again remarkable. (2) The great danger in attempting to rush across a river in face of the enemy without the m«st careful preparations and very thorough organization is well exemplified by the events on the Diyala, 7th—9tlj March. (3) The extraordinary way in which the Turks, disorganized,, defeated, devoid of signal arrangements, short of transport and mate rial, not only managed to hang up our advance for four days and inflict on us heavy casualties, but also despite darkness, dust storm, and dis aster to slip successfully away from under our noses, is most admirable. From the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, London, to the General Officer Commanding, Force ' D', Basra, dated 20th February, 1917. Reference your X-878 (Dy. No. 13224) of February 24th received yesterday. With reference to the War Cabinet's instructions of Sep tember 28th, thejr have decided to modify them as follows :— BEGINS—It is the policy of His Majesty's Government to establish British influence in the Baghdad Vilayet subject to the security of you r force and to the capacity of your communications.-—ENDS. Having regard to your communications, to enemy reinforcements and to the importance of your main body not being later forced to fall back for any reason, this decision requires you to press the enemy in the direction of Baghdad and so exploit your recent success to the full extent which you hope to be feasible and useful. Because of its objectionable political effect, the retirement of your main body above referred to might be an indirect military disadvan tage, although perhaps not a direct one. From information in my possession, I have no grounds fox thinking that Turks can collect sufficient troops to imperil your safet^ south of X312 Baghdad before Grand Duke is ready, which ehould be in about 4 or 5 weeks, to assume the offensive. The date depends to a great extent upon the disappearance of the snows which are exceptionally heavy this year, but I am pressing him to begin as soon as possible. Until we see definitely what the Russians can do, it appears to me to be pre mature, and possibly dangerous, for you to occupy and hold Baghdad, bat when the Grand Duke advances the superiority of the Allies should be such as to make it safe for you to do so. In order to destroy the important depots which the enemy has in Baghdad, it would be very advantageous for your Cavalry to raid Baghdad if it becomes possible. The capacity of your communications must, at the present time, be the principal factor in the situation. What is more, I understand that during the flood season Baghdad can be rendered untenable and that to make its possession effective, extended dispositions beyond the' town would be necessary. In your X-598 (Dy. No. 8482) of February 6th you state that before April 1st you do not expect to be able to maintain a cavalry division and three divisions at Baghdad and until you can maintain four divi sions and a cavalry division there, I doubt, if your main body should enter Baghdad. Question of withdrawing 13th Division from you will, in altered circumstances, be in abeyance for the present and your line of com munications will be provided for by fresh troops coming out from India. If the foregoing instructions and the War Cabinet decision do not sufficiently explain your mission, inform me accordingly. Further, I hope you will continue to give me your views as the subse quent development of the situation may require, as it is difficult for me to appreciate local circumstances. Please remember in this connection that for the Russians to reach Baghdad before we do is undesirable. From the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, London, to the General Officer* Commanding, Force ' D', Basra, dated 3rd March, 1917. To avoid possibility of confusion by forwarding further instructions is my desire, but I may remind you that since the despatch of my tele gram No. 30195 (Dy. No. 14023), of February 28th, telegrams received from you show that defeat of Turks was more complete than I had reason to suppose. In consequence feasibility of occupying Baghdad at once is probably greater than I then concluded. I hope, therefore, thax you understand my 30195 (Dy. No. 14023) left matters to your own judgment subject to due regard being paid to communications and secu rity and to other points mentioned therein. Briefly our object should313 fee to obtain greatest possible result from your recent victory but not ho io overdo things as to bring about a repetition of tiie old trouble with communications or be forced to withdraw once Baghdad ia defimtelv occupied by us.( 314 ) CHAPTER XXIII. The situation after the capture of Baghdad, 12th March 1917. (Reference map 20.) At this point it is worth while considering the strategical situation. In France the Allies were preparing for an offensive on a large scale,, but there was little prospect of any decision during the year. In Italy after the iZonzo battle of November 1916, and in Serbia after the taking of Monastir, static conditions had supervened. The intensive submarine campaign, commenced by Germany in February, was already causing us great anxiety. This might well affect the sea communications on which our campaigns in Palestine and'Meso potamia depended. Conscription had been in force in England for nine months, and the limita of British man-power were calculable. It could hardly be hoped that the IL S. A. which had joined the Allies in February could develop much strength for at least another year. In Palestine thd British had occupied El Arish and were preparing for the first Battle of Gaza. The Sherifian revolt had been in progress some nine months, but was not yet seriously affecting the Turks. The Russians were in occupation of Erzeroum, Erzinjan and Tre- bizond. It must be remembered that although the scandals connected with the Russian Government and Army were known, and although the revolution had actually commenced on the day before Gen. Maude captured Baghdadj there was no suspicion at this time of the extent to which this would spread nor of its momentous consequences. On the contrary great confidence in Russian co-operation in Mesopotamia is evident. There are constant references thereto in the C.I.G.S. tele grams of this period, in fact Gen. Maude is urged to base his plans, on that factor. Some anxiety had been previously shown by India lest the Russians should enter Baghdad before us, but they too were now in favour of the closest co-operation and were considering very am bitious projects. Baratoff, slowly following up the retreat of Ali Ihsan's XIII Corps, was in the neighbourhood of Kermanshah. He had a good road behind him back to the Caspian, and had been ordered by the Grand Duke, who was sending him reinforcements of over two Divisiors (mainly Cossacks), to pursue vigorously and co-operate with the British in des troying the XIII Turk Corps.315 ChernobazofE's 7tli Caucasian Corps was snowed up at Bane, It was also to be reinforced by two cavalry divisions and was to threaten Mosul as soon as weather peimitted. The main Russian forces were in the Caucasus area, but the inter vening country was difficult, and winter conditions had brought oper ations to a standstill. As time went on it will be seen that Eussian pressure rapidly dimi nished, and all hope of help from that quarter evaporated in the general Eussian debacle. The most effective aid we could afford to Eussia would be to advance to Mosul, where a junction might be effected. Mosul however was 240 miles distant. The Tigris above Samarra was unnavigable, and the German railway was only in existence from Baghdad to Samarra. For any further advance extension of this line would be essential, as well as railway communication below Baghdad. Stocks of railway material in India, however, were apparently so small as ( to make the possible provision of necessary material extremely problematic. Great delay in any case must supervene. As regards an advance up the Euphrates, a railway here would be even more necessary, and the distances would be greater before any effec tive pressure could be brought to bear on the Turks. To draw the latter away from the Eussians it might be more effec tive and quicker to apply pressure in Palestine. The Turks were containing considerable Eusso-British forces. The immediate task of the latter was to defeat the Turks so as to make the Allied troops available for the decisive theatre of war. The passive occupation of Baghdad would not effect this, but the political and strategic importance of the place was such as to warrant the supposi tion that the enemy would not easily acquiesce in its loss, and that a great effort would be made for its recapture, even if this involved stand ing on the defensive in the Caucasus and withdrawing troops lent to the Central Powers. The C. I. G. S. did not therefore for the present contemplate opera tions beyond the Baghdad Vilayet. It will thus be seen that both the general and local plans of cam paign were governed by the capacity of our communications. In any case the first main essential to any further operations must be the securing on a sound basis of the means of communication between Basra and Baghdad. This was actually effected without continuous railway communica tion by building a line from Kut to Ba ghdad and by working river trans port on the Kut-Amara stretch. On the night of lOth-llth March Khalil had ordered the retreat from Baghdad and withdrawn his own Headquarters to Samarra.316 Prior to ©vacuating the city the enemy had removed or burned all the stores he could. The Turkish evacuation having left the city and Vilayet without any civil administration, considerable looting, probably mainly by Kurds, had taken place in the short interval between the departure of the Turks and our arrival. Gen. Maude obtained permission to place the administration on a sound basis, irrespective of whether the Government policy was to hold Baghdad after the war or not. Qualified Political Officers were accordingly gradually obtained, very largely from India. The XVIII Corps had retreated up both banks of the Tigris, covering the withdrawal of stores. On the left bank the 14th Division and 37th Regiment had split up, a portion having retired Turkish Dipositions. ^ Baquba to link up with the XIII Turkish Corps whilst the remainder moved up Tigris. The original 4th and 45th Divisions had lost so heavily that they were merged into the 51st and 52nd Divisions, who were now retreating up the Tigris right bank and were reported holding a position in the vicinity of Mushahidiya, at a strength of about 5,000 rifles and 26 guns. The Turks were reported to be feverishly reinforcing the XVIII Corps, the leading regiment of the 53rd Division being already on its way from Nisibin. The small Turkish force on the Euphrates was withdrawing at full speed up river. The XIII Corps (strength 800 sabres, 7,500 rifles, 1,500 levies and 50 guns) were withdrawing from Persia in front of Baratofi. At the moment they were believed to be between Kermanshah and Qasr-i- Shirin, the 6th Division leading and the 2nd Division in touch with the Russians on the Pai Tak Pass. Ali Ihsan hoped to rejoin the 6th Army near Mosul, probably via Kirkuk, and had already sent a flank guard to Baquba where it would co-operate with the detachment of the XVIII Corps already mentioned, to protect his crossing of the Diyala at Qizil Robat. On this date the Tigris Force (strength about 45,000 effective rifles and sabres) was concentrated in and around Baghdad. It will be seen that the British were on interior lines. Of this fact Gen. Maude took immediate advantage.( 317 ) CHAPTER XXIV. The operations after the capture of Baghdad. (S ee M aps 21, 22, 23.) Steps now immediately necessary were :— (1) To control the river and prevent the flooding of the Baghdad area. (2) To clear the remnants of the Turkish XVIII Corps out of the Baghdad Vilayet. (3) In co-operation with the Eussians to destroy the Turkish XIII Corps. The table below gives in parallel columns the operations now under taken in various directions and may be of assistance in showing the sequence and co-ordination of actions in this phase.

The first moves made were :— • (а) I Corps (less 3rd Division ) took up the pursuit of XVIII Tur kish Corps west of the Tigris. (б) 7th Infantry Brigade with attached troops to Falluja on the Euphrates. (c) III Corps operated between the Tigris and Diyala to prevent co-operation between separated units of the Turkish 6th Army, the first move being the despatch of the 40th Brigade to Daudiya to secure the bunds on the Tigris left bank. {d) The 3rd Division (less 7th Infantry Brigade) with 7th Cavalry Brigade and other troops attached, moved northwards towards Persia on the east bank of the Diyala to impede the Turkish retreat, and generally assist the Russian pur suit. These will now be dealt with in detail. The I Corps, less the 3rd Division, left Baghdad at 2330 on the 13th, directed on Bait Nawab, where the Turkish positions were to be re connoitred before attack. Direction was lost during the night march but eventually the enemy were located in a well prepared position four aud a half miles south Mushahidiya Station, with their right on some sand hills. After considerable delay, partly due to mirage and diffi culties of Jocating the enemy, the attack was launched at 1520, the 21st Brigade west of the railway with the 19th Brigade in rear of the 28th319 Brigade east of the railway. The Turks opened fire at long range and it was not till 2330 that the 21st Brigade after much hard fighting seized the railway station. It was the determined advance of the 21st Brigade that decided this action in which we were opposed by some 7,000 Turks and 24 guns, of whom they lost about 800 casualties, whilst our casual ties were 600. Immediate pursuit was not practicable in view of the exhaustion of the troops, and after clearing the battle-field the troops returned to Baghdad on the 17th March leaving one Brigade to watch the river bunds. Another subsidiary operation of great importance for the safeguard ing of Baghdad from floods was also necessary. The Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Falluja is appreciably higher than the Tigris at Bagh dad and the country between. By opening the mouth of the ^akhla- wiya Canal, Lake iqarquf can be filled and the country south of it flooded. This might render impossible all communications between Baghdad and the Euphrates. The possession of Falluja therefore is essential for the safeguarding of Baghdad. Moreover, the Turkish Euphrates detachment, reckoned at 2,000 rifles, some cavalry and 4 guns, with gunboats and barges, was on the 13th March still two marches south of Falluja. Gen. Maude wished to seiz^ Falluja at once but supply difficulties prevented this and it was i&gt;ot till the 19th March that the 7th Infantry Brigade reached Falluja, which was found occupied by the Turks. The latter withdrew and after some opposition, mostly from Arabs, we reached the mouth of the Canal only to find that it had been cut so effectively that its repair was impossible. The situation was serious, but eventually the road and Decauville Railway were saved by the con struction of bunds along the Nukhta road, and communications with the Euphrates were maintained. A simpler way of easing the out flow would have been to cut the bunds on the right bank of the Euphrates above Sakhlawiya, turning the river into Lake Habbaniya. This &lt;?ourse was not adopted as it was thought that it would increase the hostility of the Dulain Tribes, by flooding their land. There was some fighting with the Arabs during the next month, but as they discovered Turkish backing was not forthcoming they gradually came to terms. The foregoing operations were necessary to safeguard Baghdad from inundations. Strategically Gen. Maude's main immediate objective was to link up with the Russians and prevent the Turkish XIII Corps •crossing the Diyala at Qizil Eobat. On the 14th March a small party of infantry from the 14th Division had been pushed up the right bank of the Diyala towards Baquba in Ford Vans. They were pinned down by Turkish fire on the 15th on the river bank opposite Baquba, where the bridge had already been re moved.320 On March 16th a column consisting of the 8th Infantry Brigade with attached guns, Sappers and Miners, Pioneers and Bridging Train, was despatched via Khan Beni Saad to secure Baquba crossing. It must be recollected that throughout this period no maps were available. On the 17th this column reached the neighbourhood of Baquba which they found held. With the assistance of aeroplane reconnaissance plans were made, a feint was arranged upstream, and during the night a crossing was effected three miles below the town, and Baquba itself captured soon after daybreak. The Turk detachment withdrew north wards. On the 19th Gen. Maude reported to the C. I. G. S. that be had concentrated a column of 8,000 men at Baquba, that the supply situation was excellent and that he was prepared to co-operate with the Russians. He requested that BaratofPs movements might be expedited in order to cut off the XIII Corps.. He also requested at this time that the respective spheres of influence, British and Russian, might be definitely laid down. The British Column, known as Keary's Column, consisted of :— 7th Cav. Bde. (less British Regt.), 7th F. Troop, portion of am munition and supply column. 4th R. F. A. Bde. (less 1 Bty.)—12 guns 18 pr. 215th R. F. A. Bde.—8 18 prs. B 69th How. Bty.—4 4•5 ,, Hows. 18th and 20th F. Coys., S. &amp; M. 8th Inf. Bde. 9th Inf. Bde. 34th Pioneers (less 1 Coy.). 1 Wagon W/T. Set. 31 C. F. A. In addition 4 Light Armoured Motor Cars were sent out on the 22nd March. Baratoffs Cavalry Column were nearing Karind, Gen. Keary's instructions were :— (1) To impede the retreat of the XIII Corps, cut off any detach ments and assist Russian pursuit. (2) Concentrate on Baquba and push on to Shahraban. (3) Carry out a vigorous advance from Baquba taking care not to commit the force across river obstacles without ensuring the possibilities of withdrawal in case of flood. He was to be maintained from Baquba by 150 Ford Vans. As a matter of fact large stores of grain and fodder were found in Baquba and Shahraban.321 At 1400 on the 19th Gee. Keary was informed that some 2,000 Turks were advancing from Qasr-i-Shirin on Shahraban. He was instructed to conceal his strength, draw them on and destroy them. He moved out a portion of his force on the 20th but it was not till the 21st that the enemy were encountered holdiug Shahraban, the bridge over the Mahrut Canal being destroyed. Gen. Keary was delayed here till the 23rd when the Turks evacuated and the pursuit was taken up to the foot of Jabal Hamrin. Here the 8th Infantry Brigade was held up by a strong position behind two big canals whose existence had previ ously been unknown. The first of these, the Nahrunia, was crossed by this Brigade that night but further progress was stopped by the Balad Euz. It now became evident that the Turks were holding in consi derable strength the historic position of the Jabal Hamrin, a broad ridge of rock rising some 800 feet from the plain. He had, as was known, in this area, the 6th ^nd part of the 14th Divisions, with 3 Muratteb Battalions—a total strength of 5,600 rifles, 240 sabres and 40 guns. The position was one of great strength and actually occupied by 4,500 rifles and 20 guns. Gen. Keary determined to hold the enemy in front with two battalions whilst the bulk of the column were to cross the Balad Ruz well to the south and attack the enemy's left flank at dawn on the 25th. Premature commencement of bridging, however, disclosed the plan to the enemy. Moreover after crossing this stream instead of keeping well to the right the attack inclined somewhat to the left. Nor was it pushed on with sufficient vigour. As a result instead of gaining the ridge beyond the Turkish left, it struck this ridge just where it had been reinforced, and was severely handled. In fact the 9th Bri gade was only extricated with considerable difficulty by using.every available man in the 8th Brigade to cover its withdrawal. Our casual ties were just under 1,200. This action is an interesting example of hill warfare with modern weapons in country very similar to the North- West Frontier. On the 26th March the Turks withdrew followed 4ip by the 8th Bri gade which reached Qizil Robat on 1st April 1917 just after the last of the Turks had crossed to the right bank of the Diyala. At this place contact was gained with the Cossacks on the 1st April. These operations afford an excellent example of successful rear guard work in two directions by Ali Ihsan. He had held off the Rus sians on the Pai Tak Pass with two battalions only, whilst he withdrew the remainder of the 2nd Division through Qizil Robat. Meanwhile he held the strong Jabal Hamrin position with the 6th Division and as soon as he had inflicted a reverse on the British and had cleared the remainder of his Corps successfully, withdrew this rearguard also. To assist the XIII Corps, Khalil had meanwhile transferred the XVIII Corps across the Tigris to the Adhaim, and was now advancing at a322 strength of about 500 sabres, 5,000 rifles and 24 guns, in the hopes of joining hands on the line Es Sued—Sindiya. To counter this manoeu vre Gen. Maude had ordered the Cavalry Division to Baquba where they were on the 24th to pick up the 7th Cavalry Brigade from Keary's Column and operate to locate the enemy and prevent him mov ing. Assisted by a battalion of the Norfolks they successfully contained the Turks (estimated at 4,500 rifles and 10 guns) till the 30th when the latter retired north. Meanwhile the 13th Division had concentrated behind the Sindiya— Daltawa line and on the 29th attacked the XVIII Corps near Marah and forced it across the Adhaim. Our losses were 450. The enemy left 200 dead and 180 prisoners in our hands. The energy and soldierly qualities of Ali Ihsan are well illustrated by his grasp of the situation and the quick action he took even before disengaging himself at Jabal Hamrin to efiect the, concentration of the XVIII Corps. Having been foiled in the attempt to unite the 6th Army west of the Jabal Hamrin, Khalil now hoped to do so by bringing the XIII Corps back via Kifri to join him. His supply situation was bad and gun ammunition short, and he was dependent on the river and railway from Mosul. The XIII Corps was particularly badly oi^ as they were withdrawn through country which had been devastated, by previous operations. The morale of the XVIII Corps was poor, but reinforce ments of 2 Divisions and 2 Kegiments were on their way, also some more German aeroplanes and German air mechanics. A large concentration was reported at Diarbeker and Nisbin. Gen. Maude was now most anxious for the Russians to act with vigour. He pointed out to the C. I. G. S. (who transmitted it to Alex- ;ieff, the new Russian C.-in-C.) that he could not hope to operate on two lines on account of his shortage of land transport. He suggested that the Russians should deal with the XIII Corps, whilst he confined his attentions to the destruction of the XVIII Corps. In the event Rus sian co-operation proved a myth. The 70,000 men of the 7th Cau casian Corps were still sitting at Bane, and in the middle of April Cher- nobuzoff said his men did not like him, and resigned. Baratoff demanded rations for 10,000 rifles and 6,000 sabres. Our War OfBce told Gen. Maude he could safely halve these numbers. This proved only too true. Soon after, it was found that his total strength now only amounted to some 3,000 troops of very inferior quality. Moreover, Baratoff him self declared that his role had been to clear Persia, that he had done this and was going no further. It began to be apparent that the Russian revolution had done its work and that no further help could be hoped for from that direction. As a result 200,000 Turks might well be set free, some of whom would be available for the Mesopotamian front.323 However, in the meantime, Gen. Maude had ordered Keary's column back to Baghdad. To deal with the XVIII Turkish Corps he concen trated by 2200 on April 5th a column on either bank of the Tigris. Fane's Column (strength about 6,000 rifles, 70 sabres and 44 guns) was on the right bank in the neighbourhood of Sunaikcha, consisting of the 7th Division, and a Squadron of cavalry, artillery, a bridging train,, and a Flight, R. F. C. Marshall's Column was on the left bank about Sindiya consisting of the 13th Division, a weak Cavalry Brigade under Gen. Cassels, some- attached troops, a bridging train and a Flight, E. F. C. At this date the disposition of the XVIII Turkish Corps was reported to be—on the left bank of the Adhaim 500 sabres, 4,300 rifles and 28 guns ; on the right bank about Balad 200 sabres, 6,200 rifles and 16 guns : in a reserve at Samarra of 2,200 rifles and 10 guns. Fane's Column reached Sunaikcha on the 7th. At 1700 on the 8th a force consisting of the 28th Brigade with attached troops, attacked the Turkish position at Balad station, enveloping the right flank, and driving the enemy back 1,500 yards, whence they again retired during^ the night, their losses being 200 killed and 189 prisoners. Our cas ualties were 56. During the night the 19th Brigade were pushed through and captured Harbeh. The weather was now getting hot, the column was 23 miles from river- head and supply was becoming difficult, though 26 undamaged railway trucks captured at Harbeh proved most useful with horse draft. Gen.. Fane was told to hold his positions defensively and to reconnoitre Istabulat where the Turks were now reported to have 9,200 rifles, 32'. guns and 320 sabres. This halt was also desirable on account of events on the left bank where Marshall's Column had reached the Kawar Eeach by the 7th April. Information was then received that the XIII Corps (believed to be 500 sabres, 6,000 rifles and 25 guns) was moving down from the Kifri road along the Khalis Canal to attack this column in flank. Accordingly the Cavalry Division which was in touch with the enemy and reported them entrenching about Arab bu Abin on the 10th, were put under General Marshall's orders. The actual dispositions of the enemy were later ascertained to be :— Opposing the Russians at Qizil Robat, 5,000 rifles and 14 guns. Advancing down the Khalis Canal, 7,000 rifles, 35 guns and 300 sabres. In reserve at Kara Tepe 1,300 rifles and 10 guns. Gen. Marshall left the 38th Brigade to watch the Adhaim. With the remainder of his column he turned east and at dawn on the 11th, somewhat to the surprise of both sides, who had both been moving at night, an encounter battle took place north-west of Shaila. This resulted in the withdrawal324 &lt;of the enemy to Arab bu Abin trenches wit&amp; about 1,000 casualties. Our own casualties were about 250 : there were also 50 cases of heat stroke. We made an unsuccessful attack on the Arab bu Abin position on the 13th. On the 15th the enemy withdrew to the foothills beyond Delli Abbas. We followed up and on finding the enemy strongly en trenched Keary's Column, consisting of— the Cavalry Division (less two Eegiments and one Battery, E.H.A.) and the 13th Division (less Yeomanry, one artillery brigade, one company, E.E., and 38th Infantry Brigade) were left to hold the entrenched line about Arab bu Abin and remain in observation. Gen. Marshall with 35th Infantry Brigade and Cassels' cavalry returned to the Adhaim and concentrated with the 38th Brigade at Dugama on the 17th. The enemy, in strength about 2,000, were hold ing the right bank of the Adhaim. This river, at this season only about three feet deep and ten to fifteen yards wide, has a treacherous bottom and can only be crossed at the fords. The stream meanders about in a bed some 2,000 yards wide, sunk 40 or 50 feet below the general level of the plain. The walls of the bed are in most places sheer. The crossing of the Adhaim on the night of the 17-18th is an inter esting example of an operation of this nature (see sketch). Cassels' cavalry was sent upstream and a demonstration was made at the old ford (a). The enemy's attention having been drawn in this direction, the actual crossing took place without being discovered at (6), and the opposite cliffs were seized. The enemy's full attention was thus con centrated on his left flank. Meanwhile during the night two batta lions had been passed in pontoons across the river at (c) near its mouth. Their presence was entirely unsuspected and at 0450 just before dawn they rushed the Turks on the cliffs with hardly a casualty. As soon as they were established north of Kubbej Village, a bridge was thrown at {d) and reinforcements passed over, the plan being to drive in be tween the enemy's right and the Tigris. At 1230 after bombardment, 3 battalions achieved this with complete success, and Cassels' Brigade which had been brought back after the early morning demonstration was at once put through the gap, cutting the enemy off from the river. The action was a complete success ; over 1,200 prisoners were taken, 700 surrendering to the cavalry alone, who continued the pursuit till 0200. Our losses in this action were 73. On the right bank Fane's Column moved forward on the 16th and captured the Median Wall, an ancient earthwork some 30 feet in height, 6,500 yards south-east of Istabulat Station. On the 18th Gen. Cobbe arrived and took over command of the right bank. He was joined on the 20th by Cassels' cavalry and on the 21st by the 8th Brigade. A bridge had now been established at Barura.325 Tlie Turks, strength about 7,000 and 31 guns, with a further 4,000 with 16 guns at Samarra, were holding a strong entrenched position across the Duiail Canal; their left in broken ground Battle of Istabulat, xxji . xi. • ^ 21-4-1917. protected by the river, their right, which was in the flat open plain, refused well back. The Dujail Canal is a narrow water course about 20 feet deep with very steep banks, a serious obstacle, crossed by three bridges behind the Turkish line. The key of the Turkish position was two redoubts north of this Canal standing on hillocks some 40 feet above the level of the plain. We had previously constructed four strong points some 400 yards from the enemy's advanced posts and 2,200 yards from his main position. From there the 19th Brigade attacked across the open south of the Dujail Canal and captured the Station, but were unable to make further progress. The 21st Brigade attacked at dawn north of the Dujail Canal and succeeded in seizing both redoubts. There followed some hours of extremely fierce fighting during which the Dujail redoubt changed hands several times but was eventually retained by the Black Watch. A point of interest is the fact that our troops were without effective artillery support when the first Turkish counter-attack was delivered, as a number of guns were changing position at the time. The day was very hot and a duststorm was blowing. In spite of some progress on our extreme left the enemy was still in position at nightfall. At 0430 on the 22nd patrols reported that the enemy were evacuat ing. We moved forward, while the cavalry and L.A.M. cars took up the pursuit. The enemy had retired to another entrenched position some four and a half miles to the north-west, and by noon the 28th Brigade had gained contact. The heat and dust were intense. The troops were rested and the position bombarded at 1600 preparatory to renewing the attack at 1620. The plan was to force the Turkish left off the river, whilst the cavalry and L.A.M. cars worked round his right. Consider able assistance was afforded by enfilade fire from the artillery of Thomp son's Force from across the Tigris. The attack succeeded, and on the extreme right the Leicestershire Regiment overshot their objectives and pushing on nearly a mile captured 7 guns. Here the Turks put in a counter-attack with all available strength on the flank of the 28th Brigade. The captured guns were lost and the Leicestershires suffered heavily, in fact the counter-attack was only just checked by the last of the Brigade reserves. During the day Gen. Cassels had worked well round to the enemy's right, his L.A.M. cars having actually reconnoitred Samarra Station, and his guns having got good targets in the enemy's right rear.326 An example of the risk of mounted shock action against entrenched enemy, without provision of adecjuate covering fire was afforded here- The 32nd Lancers charged over an enemy trench whose occupants threw down their arms. Before advantage could be taken of this, our troopers,, who had been carried well beyond by the impetus of their charge, came under machine gun fire, and the Turks in the trench then rallied and poured a heavy fire into them from the rear. The losses of the Eegi- ment were heavy but there is no doubt that this attack at the very moment when the Turkish counter-attack was developing most seriously on the 28th Brigade, was of very material assistance, and had the L.A.M. cars been there to afford close fire support, it would have been a complete success. Fighting continued into the night, but before morning the Turks had evacuated their position and retired north. Next morning 23rd, we reached Samarra. The two days fighting had cost us 2,000 casualties, but the Turks had also suffered severely. They left 500 dead on the field. We captured 259 unwounded prisoners and much material including 170 broad gauge trucks, 10 heavy and 5 light engines, 2 miles of Decauville line and 2 ammunition barges. The indefatigable Ali Ihsan was meanwhile making another effort with his XIII Corps. After withdrawing through the Diyala gap in the Jabal Hamrin he had transferred the bulk of his force by dint of hard marching behind the screen of those mountains to the Adhaim gap, and was now moving rapidly down that river against our eastern flank. To conceal his intention he had left behind a force of about 2,300* with 4 guns, which on the 24th April moved down the Diyala and drove back our Cavalry near Delli Abbas. His manoeuvre, though well con ceived and well executed, did not deceive us, for the reason that for some time past our intelligence had given us prompt and accurate information of the enemy's movements. Ali Ihsan's movements were therefore easily countered. On the 24th, the day on which his detachment was demonstrating at Delli Abbas, when he himself was only some 25 miles from the mouth of the Adhaim, he was met at Dahuba by Marshall's Column (35th, 38th and 40th Brigades and 7th Cavalry Brigade) and forced to retire 25 miles to Band-i-Adhaim at the foot of the Jabal Hamrin. Gen. Marshall followed up and the Battle of Band-i-Adhaim was fought on the 30th April. The Turks were entrenched across the river which was at this time small and fordable, but meanders in a bed 2,000 to 3,000 yards wide which is bordered by cliff-like banks 30 feet or more in height. Gen. Marshall feinted against their left by moving the 38th Bri gade out to the north-east at dusk on the 29th. At daybreak on the 30th, the main attack by the 40th Brigade, covered by all available-327 artillery, was put straight into a village just behind the enemy's centre^ being supported on the left by the 35th Brigade. The main stroke was completely successful, so much so that the ob jective was overshot and two battalions pushed on for nearly two miles capturing two batteries of guns and 300 prisoners. At this juncture a heavy duststorm set in, completely obscuring the landscape and the situation, and preventing any further artillery support. Ali Ihsan made bold use of this. He passed his whole reserve across the river, wheeled, and moving across the front of the 38th Brigade invisible in the duststorm, struck the advanced portion of the 40th Brigade with all his force. He recaptured 7 of his 8 guns and the ma jority of the prisoners, and swept our troops back through the village, till he was held up by the S.A. fire of the remainder of the 40th Brigade, wno were fortunately moving up in support. The storm abated about 1600 and the Turks were again driven out of the village. During the night Ali Ihsan withdrew through the Jabal Hamrin. We had severe casualties in this action but it finally paralysed the Turks, and proved to be the last fight until our fresh advance in the Autumn. The situation now was that Gen. Maude was in effective occupation of the Basra and Baghdad Vilayets, and was in position to control the water of all three rivers—Tigris, Euphrates and Diyala, In the four and a half months fighting the Turkish 6th Army may be said to have been destroyed ; Kut, Baghdad and Samarra captured, control of the Euphrates assured as high as Falluja the road to Persia opened, and the country in our rear pacified. The total advance made on the Tigris had been little short of 2C0 miles. Our battle casualties in these operations had been about 18,000.. This out of a total fighting strength of 45,000 available for the operations gives 40 per cent. A high percentage, but considerably less than the losses suffered in the four months of unsuccessful endeavour to relieve Kut. Y( 328 ) CHAPTER XXV. Some general reflections on the Campaign. Throughout this story of. the Campaign, criticisms have been offered and suggestions made. These criticisms may or may not be sound, but were made for instructional purposes, based on the facts as known at the time. Some general notes are added in conclusion. Two of the most important factors were undoubtedly Administra tion and the effect of the terrain. The former has been gone into in -considerable detail, and it is therefore unnecessary to touch on it again. The ground enormously favoured the defence. The attacker mov ing over the open was subject to the full force of the smail arms fire of the defence at long ranges. The effect pro- Terrain. duced was so great that again and again such attacks were brought to a halt with heavy casualties, at ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 yards. The presence of numerous water cuts close to the river, the lack of all land marks, mirage, and the ease with which digging could be carried out, all assisted the defence. The vast dis tances, the flat bare featureless plain, the lack of adequate cover, the inundations under the control of the enemy up stream of us, all added enormously to the difficulties of the attack. Movement was handicapped by lack of information and maps and by the complete absence oi drink able water, apart from the river, in the hot weather ; while in the cold weather the whole plain became a morass of sticky mud. In this con nection, even from a map, the importance of the Tigris is obvious. But until one has visited the ground it is almost Importance of Tigris. im p 0SS ^ e f u ny to realise its influence on the opera tions, not only as an obstacle but as a line of sapply and, above all, as the source of water to which, therefore, all troops were tied. Ihe result ol this wae.the one weakness of the defence-, viz,, that except under the unique conditions afforded by the Suwaikiya Marsh, and later by the angles between the Hai and Tigris, there was always an open flank. General Townshend had grasped The Open Flank. f ac ^ an( j operations at Es Sinn and Ctesi- phon are good examples of bold night operations. Later in the cam paign advantage was repeatedly taken of this fact. In deed it may be said that almost all later battles, Kamadi, Khan Baghdadi, Tikrit, were planned on the turning of the outer flank. From a tactical point of view, one of the peculiar lessons seems to be the advantages of night operations in this country. The difficulties329 mlierent ill such operations in close and uncivilised countiy are min- Night Operations. i mised &gt; alld the advantages increased. Direction is no more difficult to maintain than by day. There being no landmarks, the compass must be in any case relied upon. There are few, if any, obstacles to be crossed or that might cause confusion. Communication is hardly more difficult than by day. Surprise may be hoped for, and it is possible to move on wide front ages. Above all, the supremacy of the rifle is almost annulled. Both at Dujaila and at the first Sannayiat, the part of the operations that took place in the dark was successful. In both cases it was day light that produced disaster. The advance of the III Corps to the Hai and the approach to the Khaidari Bend were night operations of great success. But it is not until we turn to the later phases of the campaign that we find the advantages of the night fully appreciated, the ad vances to Shumran, Tikrit, and Khan Baghdadi. With regard to Infantry. The difficulties of providing adequate • covering fire are conspicuous. Here only one point will be raeutioned Infantry Taoths. t ' le tact ' cs adopted. At first infantry attempted to provide their own covering fire by advancing in a series of rushes in accordance with pre-war training. The results of this may be seen in all the early battles when the attack was slowed mp at a range of 1,000 yards or more, and where the Turks were able to •concentrate such intense fire on each successive party as it rose to run forward that the attack was invariably brought to a standstill 800 yards or more from its objective. The solution in the end was found to be a non-stop attack by the infantry, covering fire being provided by other means. ^Nothing is more disappointing in the Mesopotamian Campaign than the outstanding failure of the cavalry in the opening years. The ex- Cavalry. traordinary brilliance of their 'successes in the last year is the more remarkable. It was the same cavalry, the same material. There was indeed some difference in the ground later but not sufficient to justify the poor results obtained during the march to Baghdad and before. The reasons for the early failures are worthy of examination in some detail. Organization. The Cavalry Brigade originally sent to Mesopo tamia was hampered by the fact that the 6 regular Brigades having already gone to France, only a scratch Brigade was available for Meso- potamia. tire power was extremely weak, regiments having only 2 machine gims. As regards personnel, the peace system of Depots had broken down, and units were largely dependent on the efforts of individual Depot Y 2330 Commanders. Difficulties which should never have occurred, more over, arose in certain units over caste questions and the feeding of vari ous classes. The going ' must be said to have been good for cavalry on the- whole, but the country gave no cover for led horses. Concealment for • enemy infantry was easy and was much assisted by water cuts. Owing to their conspicuousness it was difficult for the cavalry to effect surprise, unless mobility, and such factors as mirage, were made full use o f . If dismounted action was resorted to, the led horses had. to be kept so far in rear, that the difficulties of breaking off an action, were greatly increased. All the above factors, however, only emphasize the importance of making use of th eir full mobility ; of moving swiftly and acting mounted ; of wide movements, and if serious opposition met with, of going wider still. The country favoured this and every advantage lay with the mounted man. Unfortunately this simple fact seems never to have been grasped until young and energetic leaders were appointed much later in the cam paign. In the period under consideration the cavalry seem to have invariably moved at the slowest possible pace, hung on to the infantry,, often in their rear, and taken the first opportunity of getting off their horses and coming to a standstill. Up to the occupation of Baghdad, orders to the cavalry appear to- have been indefinite at times, as at the Wadi, or at times too binding, Importance of young as at Dujaila : objectives given were too close- and energetic to the infantry fire fight, with the result that leadership. ca ^ a j r y g 0 t involved therein : the single E. H. A. battery was insufficient support in such country : unneces sarily large parties of cavalry were often used with the result that men and animals were not always quite fresh at the critical time. Still it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that good leadership was lacking at this time. That General Maude himself felt this was indicated by his orders to the Cavalry Division, and his insistence on their constantly reporting their position and keeping in connection with his Headquarters by W.T. Two further factors should be mentioned. First—water. Dependence on the river made it desirable to train animals to drink early. If this was not possible it would seem that more . night movement should have been resorted to. The handicap caused to the operations by the cavalry having repeatedly to break off an important movement in order to return to the river, frequently many miles distant, in order to water, is seen again and again in the operations before Baghdad, and earlier s 4 ill in the beginning of General Maude's offensive.331 Secondly the Arabs. The existence of large bodies of mounted Arabs necessitated considerable strength in patrols thus increasing the Arab irregulars. wear an( i tear on the cavalry. Our horses weighed down with 20 stone of oddments on their backf;, could not compete with the light Buddoo,' who literally made rings round them. Would it not have been possible to organize a proportion of very lightly equipped men., who would have had a chance of bringing off shock action against the enemy whose small animals were not actual ly as fast as ours ? Automatic weapons. The importance of the automatic weapons of the infantry is now well recognized. This, however, was not the Automatic weapons. case /^ring the period under consideration. The Lewis and Hotchkiss guns were unknown in Meso potamia before the advent of the troops from France, who brought a few. Infantry battalions possessed 4 machine guns. These were not origaded at first, and it is noticeable that brigading machine guns had hardly been practised in India at all before the war. It seems to have been insufficiently recognized that machine guns are offensive as well as defensive weapons. They were not used far enough forward nor sufficiently on the flanks, where they might have assisted not only the infantry but the cavalry also, for instance at the Wadi. Machine guns should have been pushed well up in the attack and infiltration tactics as carried out by the Germans should have been 'tried. The effect, of having machine guns too far back in the attach meant that they were not up soon enough to repel the counter-attack which the Turks inevitably put in. In the defence the bulk of our machine guns seem to have been in the front line. They should have been used in greater depth and primarily to assist the infantry by filling gaps, and to economise force. From the Turkish point of view the country was eminently suitable. .'Machine guns were easily concealed and very difficult to locate. More over, the artillery available with the British was insufficient for their systematic destruction. Machine guns could be hidden in nullahs and sited not only to sweep the open but to control such water cuts as would otherwise have afforded covered approaches. In 1916 the Turkish establishment allowed for 6 machine guns per battalion. Machine gun work was co-ordinated by a German officer. In short, it may be said that in view of the absence of Tanks or other means of dealing effectively with these weapons, an attack by day gave little prospects of success. The failure of the artillery sufficiently to support the infantry to enable them to make good their attacks may be attributed to three332 main factors. The first of these was the difficulty of applying nre accu rately. It is unnecessary further to emphasize the- difficulties of observation, lack of accurate maps and the shortage of aeroplanes, which were the main reasons. It may be said that in such ground it is most difficult to shoot at the right' place unless aeroplanes are available both to locate the targets and to range the batteries. Aeroplane photos will not solve the problem, they may assist but some other means in addition to ground observation or air photos alone is necessary in order to fire at the right place at the right time. Sound location and flash spotting are touched on below. Application of fire to the right place, though a self-evident necessity, was not always successful. At Dujaila the Mound itself offered a good target. It was heavily shelled, but the trenches at its foot escaped. At the first Sannaiyat,. fire was not applied to the infantry's objective but only to the trenches in rear thereof and wide to its flanks. With regard to applica tion at the right time, it seems that in open warfare, more definiteness as to time will be unavoidable. The time programme may be found necessary even in the most open kind of warfare. With regard to the position of the guns. The advantages of pushing the guns well up were often illustrated. For this pack artillery were particularly useful. There are many examples. The pack guns were used on rafts in the Qurna and Nasiriya operations. The 23rd Mountain Battery got over the Wadi on the 13th January when all other artillery was held up, and the action of the same battery in assisting the 1 8th Brigade to repel the counter-attack at Bait Isa is historic. In the early stages of a campaign in future it may be expected that the artillery will not be strong. Mirage would add to the difficulty of shooting at guns. The battery commander will wish to be close up where he himself can observe, and near his guns for purposes of control.- Guns therefore may be expected to be shooting at ranges of between 2,000 and 3,000. Such a procedure was frequently adopted later in the campaign, for instance at Jaba] Hamrin, and at Tikrit. It is, of course, not suggested that all artillery should be pushed forward or that the advantages of distribution in depth are not paramount. But under the conditions envisaged the importance of giving close support to the in fantry is very great. Guns, however, can be pushed too far forward,. e.g. Istabulat. With regard to ammunition. The shortage of H.E. has already been. emphasized. In dry, hot weather shrapnel has a certain screening efxect but in the wetter weather of the spring operations, and in a large proportion of General Marshall's early actions, smoice would have been the only possible screen. There were difficulties as to- transport and climatic deterioration, but the fact is that at this333 period the possibilities of smoke had not been fully realised, and it was not tried in Mesopotamia. The effect of H.E. being more locai than shrapnel is more dependent upon observation. But against trenches the value of 101 delay fuse used with bouncing effect might have been considerable. There would have been good opportunities for the use of 106 fuse against the Turkish counter-attacks which always came over the open. The opportunities for enfilade fire established at Sannaiyat seem unusually good. The results seem unusually disappointing. The fact is that the success of such fire depends on good observation. With the field gun at 2,500 yards the 100 o / o length zone is 128 yards its breadth only 6, thus ranging of the enemy trenches, however attractive at first sight, is dependent on the ability to observe within 6 yards. If wrong by that amount, the fire is quite useless. Compare excellent results of shooting at Thiep- val from Mailly Maillet where the observation was extremely good. The main problem was to cover the advance of the infantry from a range of about 1,200 yards to the objective. To overcome the difficul ties which have been outlined, it has been suggested by an E.A. Officer with experience of this campaign that some such plan as is sketched below mi^ht have been tried. At a given time the guns to put down a very slow fire, as far as pos sible parallel to the enemy front line and about 600 yards short of their estimated position. This to be maintained until an aeroplane could give a general correction. It might be possible, should dust conditions be favourable, for infantry to form up close to this line of bursts during this period, but this point is immaterial. The essential is, that the infantry should report their distance from this line of bursts. After aeroplane correction has been received the artillery fire to be lifted in accordance, and intensified up to a rapid rate. This to take place at a previously fixed hour and to continue long enough to enable the infan try to reach the enemy trench. It will then lift to cover consolidation at a slow rate. The original line of fire is put down 600 yards from he enemy trenches so as to avoid aeroplanes missing the trench held by the enemy, and allow liberally for a wrong estimate of enemy position, und to be well clear of our own infantry. The whole scheme, of course, pi\ ots on the moderately correct appreciation first by the pilot, of the distance of the general line of fire from the enemy trench, then by the infantry of their distance from the original line of fire, on this latter will depend the timing of the lifts. F.O.O's will of course accompany the leading battalions to assist in this. Counter battery work. In this sort of country, artillery like infantry, being unable to obtain cover from natural features, requires cover by fire in a special degree. Hence the importance of counter battery work, more especially since, as has been pointed out, it is fVsirable to push331 tli&lt;i close support guns up to very short ranges. For good counter bat tery work the following are essential—(a) Centralized organization ; (6) Oood artillery intelligence; (c) some system of ?ross observation and good communications ; (d) Aerial co-operation; (e) Sufficient and suitable material and ammunition. la the first phase all these were absent. The artillery was hopeless ly insufficient to give even the necessary covering fire to infantry. Such counter battery work as was possible had to be attempted by river craft, the few shore guns available being obsolescent. It is true that at Qurna the mastery of the enemy artillery was complete, but this was due to the fewness of his guns and the restricted nature of his disposi tions. At Ctesiphon the artillery action of the enemy was hardly checked as thoy were under cover and ships were unable to get up close, the same may be said of the Spring of 1916. 113 the second phase, viz. General Maude's advance, the following improvements had bben made. Sufficient aircraft ana machinery for co-operation were provided. A 60-pr. battery was allotted to each Corps. Army artillery consisted of 4 60-prs., 4 6' Howitzers (T.D.), and 12 i-5' H owitzers. Mounds had been constructed with R.A. flash spotters installed thereon. These were, however, immobile. There were many mor( guns and plenty of ammunition available. Yet even as late as Isfcabulat in April 1917 artillery superiority was not achieved. The Turks in fact hit several of our guns and silenced more than one battery.335 i APPENDIX 1. Order of Battle—Advanced jiortion of 1. E. F. ' D.'
