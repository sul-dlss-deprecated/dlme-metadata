The letter also states that the carpenters and blacksmiths available locally are 'decidedly inferior' to those from India, and would represent poor value for money; the Bombay Government had queried whether artificers might be best sought from Bushire rather than sent from India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000071#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
