In a demi-official letter of 17 March 1923 (folios 2-7) the Political Agent (Major Clive Daly) discusses proposed reforms with the Political Resident (Major Arthur Trevor). These include: the institution of a joint court and native court, the persecution of Shia citizens by the Sunni-dominated judicial system, and a system of British protection that could be extended to Bahrainis facing persecution. Pearl diving reforms are also touched upon, with a description of how pearl divers are paid in the industry in Ceylon [Sri Lanka]. Later correspondence (1924) between Daly and the new Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux) relates to the drawing up of judicial codes for Bahrain, with the help of existing codes from Sudan and Iraq, which already exist in English and Arabic.The second half of the file contains correspondence from 1927, and concerns administrative changes to the Bahrain courts, rather than outright reforms. A request from Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah for the institution of a subsidiary court to hear cases involving financial claims of less than fifty rupees, is approved by the Political Resident (folios 14-17, 22). A letter from the Political Agent (Major Cyril Barrett) to the Advisor to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Belgrave), dated 14 May 1927, raises concerns over Sheikh Hamad's intention to appoint three Sunni Qazis [Qadis] to sit at the court at Muharraq, citing the extra time and costs involved (folio 20). A Bahrain State letter, from Shaikh Ḥamad to the Deputy Governor of Bahrain, dated 21 Dhul-Qadah 1345 [23 May 1927] confirms the Deputy Governor's appointment to the Sharah court, for a monthly wage of one-hundred rupees (folio 21).The date given on an office note from the Political Agent (folios 18-19) of 10 May 1937, is probably incorrect and should read 10 May 1927.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000364#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000364#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000364#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
