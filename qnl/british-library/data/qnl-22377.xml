When I visited Fujairah during ray trip to Kalba after Shaikh Haviad's assassination, Shaikh Muhammad shoved rae a letter which he had received from America and which nroved to be an offer from the M Peter Pan' philatelic Company to undertake for him the organization of an up to date postal service (including, I believe, telegraph and similar facilities, but not radar or television) and in particular offering to print( and market ) for him a handsome series of stamps. They enclosed specimens ©f their w®rk in this field. I explained to the Shaikh the nature of the offer, and thought his reception ©f it a little unent husia s tic. 3. Ali Bustani afterwards told me that Shaikh Muhammad was disappointed because he had believed the letter t© contain an offer from an Oil Company. It is pessible that he did not believe my version ( which must have sounded a little far-fetched to him ) and still cherishes the hope that it really is from an Oil Company. C.J.

He did however say that Fujairah had originally been part of Sharjah but that the Shaikh had become independent in his grandfather T s time.

He had asked the Shaikh to send a copy of the letter and promised to pass it on when received. 2.

Please refer to Stobart’s confidential letter No.0210/2/1 of the 28th March 50 and to previous correspondence on the subject of the status of Fujairah. 2. On the tv/o occasions on which I have visited Fujairah, Shaikh Muhammad bin Hamad Ash-Sharqi has raised the question of his entering into a treaty relationship with H.M.G and in addition has now written to me urging that the matter should be taken up with you in Bahrain. K \ &amp; 3. My views on his present attitude and status correspond very closely to those expressed by Stobart in his letter under reference. Shaikh Muhammad is apt to talk mysteriously of overtures he has received from the Sultan of Muscat and of approaches that he himself is contemplating in that direction, presumably in the xixxi naive belief that he can thus hustle us into affording him recognition as a Trucial Ruler. In subsequent discussion, however, he invariably refers to the Sultan in such contemptuous terms that I think there is very lettle possibility of an arrangement between the two territories materialising. ^ 6 ^ ^ . 2 a/ 4. Jackson, in his letter to you ho.547-0210 of the 8 th June, 48, suggests onat, should petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) wish to negotiate a concession in Fujairah terri tory, the Shaikh might be approached through Kalba, and hints* at an eventual merger of the two territories. 5. Certain advantages of such a merger are apparent, but I do not think the young Ruler of Kalba would profit by such an arrangement. From what I have seen, the Shaikh of Fujairah excercises considerable influence on Shaikh Hamad of Kalba, and from what I have heard this influence is not always for his good. There are reports, for instance, that the two Shaikhs indulged in a protracted drinking orgy during Ramadhan last year. I am of the opinion that Shaikh Muhammad would only enter into a union with the Ruler of Kalba on terms of equality, and that he would establish himself as the senior partner in a short space of time. 6 . Perhaps you are of the opinion that matters should be allowed to rest as they are until a decision is forced on us by the activities of the oil companies. I am by no means sure that this is not our best course, but I think that at the same time serious consideration might be given to the conclusion of a separate treaty with Shaikh Muhammad which would afford recognition in law to an independence which has long been valid in fact.
