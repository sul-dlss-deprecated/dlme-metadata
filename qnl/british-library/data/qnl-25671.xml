My Lord, I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Phipps' letter of the 30th March (185856/34) enclosing a copy of a letter from the India Office relating to the payment of Two thousand five hundred pounds made to the Bakht^ari Khans in Persia in December 1915. In reply I am to request you to inform Earl Curzon of Kedleston that, before sanctioning the payment of a moiety of this sum from Imperial revenues. My Lords would wish to be informed whether he has caused any reference to be made to Sir Charles Marling's accounts at the Foreign Office. My Lords are of opinion that such reference might show whether or no this payment was additional to that made to the Bakhtiari Khans in respect of the agreement of February 1916, or whether in making the payment of £10,000 arranged for on conclusion of the agreement, account was taken by Sir Charles Marling of the £2,500 already received by the Khans. If such account was taken, My Lords are of opinion that provision for the repayment of the moiety due to the Indian Government should have been made from the sum of £30,000 sanctioned in Treasury Letter Ho. 20216/15 of August 28th 1915, as the Imperial moiety of expenditure authorised for the purpose of subsidizing the Bakhtiari Khans.

Copies of all these telegrams Ac ere probably bein^ sent to the Foreign Office, out I am not certain about this in the ca.se of the telegram oi 4th August 1916 (Papers flagged C and E). Would it perhaps be advisable to refer the Foreign Office to these telegrams also? Sueject to this, I concur as regards the draft proposed In spite of Sir P.Cox's telegram of 4th August 1916, I venture to doubt (1) whether this sum of £2,500 did come out of tne sum of £10,000 mentioned in the Government agreement (2) whether it was intended to do so in the first instance (3j whether the Government of Inaia were bound to accept the debit at all. Dr.Young's agreement of December 1915 was not an agreement on behalf of the Government, out merely an agreement on behalf of the Oil Company; this appears from the terms of his telegram of l3th December 1915 (Flag D); he says towards the end of the telegram “ in consideration of the foregoing. I have given “Illkhani 1500 and Illbegi 1000 pounas for general reasons”. Again | Sir P.Cox in his telegram of 20th December 1915 (Flag G) says tire agreement concluded by Dr.Young applied, onxy oo tn^ Oil Company's interests. The Government agreement on the other hand was not signed until February 17th 1916 (Flag F), ond tms* te ^ accompanied by an undertaxing on the part of nis Majesty's GovernmentJLw G-ovemment w to pay each of the two branches of the Khans ”£5,000 on sipmature 1 * (Flag H). This seems to be a. totally separate transaction separate from Dr.Young's payment three months earlier, when acting as representative of the Oil Company. Again, when this Office decided to accept a moiety of the expenses entailed by the Government agreement, the Minute ana letter (Flag A) contained no allusion to the payment of £2,500 made by Dr.Young in December;, it seems to me that boyae. allusions! would naturally have been made to this, if this Office had at that time regarded that payment as in any way connected with the sum of £10,000 to be paid with reference to tne Government agreement. At the time, the payment of £2,500 was, I suggest, probably regarded as a payment made in the interests of Oil Company and therefore no t payable by His Maj esty' s Govemmen t. The Government of India, in their telegram of 4th August 1915, seems to have mixed up the separate agreements. It is noticeable that, though Dr.Young-had paid £2,500 to two Khans (tw the Illkhani and the Illbegi), the Government agreement did not refer to two Khans (as the Government of Inaia seems to think) but to two branches of the Khans. In any case, His Majesty's Government is probably committed to payment, in view of the Government of India's action. b\ / 2 .

It is regretted that the records of the Government of India contain no information respecting the debit in question, and reference was made to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who is also unable to throw any light on the matter, and thinks no further action is called for.

If two guns of the pattern in question with the requisite saddlery and a .munition are available in Indian Expeditionary Force 'D' and if tne Army Comiander concurs with me in tninking tuat it is expedient to meet the requirements of the Khans in tne matter, I shall be glad to submit for the Ar;jy Commander's consideration a draft telegram to Government on the subject.

I,lalauir and Clutak on June 4th on a carava^i of hessrs. Lyuca Brotners coasistiiio of 148 nules carrying piece goods and tea to Ispahan. 85 loads tanen by robbers. The portion of tne Lynch road exposed to PCujQ^elu raids is from Hal amir to Sxialil, a distance wnicn is usually traversed by caravans in tnree stages. The methods of guarding this stretch vary from year to year, and it is pernaps tnis absence of any continuity of policy which is cniefly responsible for the continued unsatisfactory conditions ruling on this section of the road. Some years the Khans entrust the guarding to one section of tne Kuhgelus and in other years to others, while on some occasions they tale it out of Kuhgelu hands entirely and hand it over to their own tribesmen. Eacn successive Illkhani has his own adherents (bastagan) to placate and all are, of course, only too anxious to adopt any expedient wnich promises to save their pockets. In 1814, Sirdar Jang divided tne dangerous section into two portions. Prom malaair to Bulatak he iianded over to liiiam ^uli of tne Ba*iuiai aiid from Bulatak to Shahlil to Murad Khan of the Taibis. nominally 25J tufangcliis at 6 T each a month were detailed for each section and to every 50 tufangchis there was supposed to be a rais on T 30 a month. As the road only requires Ml, protection when the III are settled in the high country, it may be taken that the above arrangements are only in force from four to five months. On this scale it would appearappear tiiat Jarjg spent sQiaetnins line T. 15,000 on road guards• I nave ascertained however mat nis expejiseG uin &gt;1 j u anoUiio uo [.ioig tlian a tnird oi tui g figure* In tne next year 1015 me protection was entrusted to Banatiari levies w.io were said to be entertained on tne scale of taat of tne previous year. Tnis year owing to tne Khans being delayed in the low country till well into me sumier aud to me dis agreement between tne Illknani and Illbegi, no adequate arrangements seem to nave been made to protect the road. When the Khans arrived at Malamir at tne beginning of June the situation seemed to them fairly satisfactory. Ko robberies had so far occurred and the Governorship of the Taibi and Sahuai sections of the Kuhgelus were in the hands of blahmoud Hussein Khan and Zaki Khan in whom the Khans nad confidence. It would seem that the lllkhani and Illbegi hoped to do matters on the cheap by placing a few of tueir own men along tne road, and to dispense with the more costly arrangement of subsidizing me Kuiigelus. Unfortunately however, on June the 4th, a large party of robbers recruited from Taibi and Bahmai tribes, owning allegiance to All Hesa Khan and Imam mil Khan respectively, raided and carried off a considerable portion of one of Messrs. Lyncn Brothers caravans of 150 mules. Ac an urgent temporary measure tne Khans paid or promised to pay Zaki Khan a sum said to be T.1000 in return for which the latter placed his tufangahis on the road. In the meanwhile the real instigators of the robbery viz. All Hesa Khan and Imam Quli Khan offered to return the stolen goods provided tne Governorship was taken away from their enemies Zaki Khan and Mahmoud hussein and made over to them. I regret to report maw me Khans, being unwilling to undertake an expedition intne fermesir during une su..ner months, agreed to be blackmailed in this shameless uanuer, and disraissed ^ aki kiian and i.'.aiLxioud ilussein ICnan, ins-talliii^ X n ineir places ine actual perpetrators of cue robbery, ine results, however, of this policy have so far been disappointing as of tne db loads stolen only d? nave uen r3 turned aixd tnose in a damaged condition. i.uuktasnam adoits ouat the expedient he nas *iad to iia vc recourse to is nothing more tnan a very unsatisfac tory makeshift, wiiich he excuses on the grounds that (1) nis work in the ailaq is more pressing than the necessity o^ cnastising tne Kungelus (2) tne great diificuluies that would attend tne organization of a Banhtiari expedi oion in tne ^armesir during the su.i.ier (3) tne lacK of support ne experiences from Muftahid.

But this he points out is not possible without a gun. He particularly requests that next autumn we should send up one of our guns to take part in an expedition which he proposes to lead against Dishmuk. I fully realise that tnis proposal is not likely to be acceptable to tne Military authorities, but I would urge its importance from the political and local point of view. Pernaps it uiignt be possible to sell tne Knans a couple of old pattern mountain guns witn a limited number of rounds and to send down to Banntiaris for training as Banners ( Aawaz a few I understand that tner A*i'.vaz garrison iz to oe increased, by a section ai x i oia cillery;• If a Britisa officer could not be spai eu to accoupaxy tne det‘ic....e.*t an tne expedition I, as an ex-guaner, would undertake to run tne detacnuent myself but would asx for the assistance of a bonbadier or artillery sergeant if available. 3d/- E.

Summary of information. Bakhtiari. Minister telegraphs 4th December :—“ Noel, who has since left Tehran, has induced Khans to accept Amir Jang as lllbegi.” Kennion telegraphs to Tehran, 5th December : — Since the blow struck by Russians on 27th November, rebel force scattered. Many Burs and gendarmes deserted altogether. A few Bakhtiari also left, some of whom passing through CHarlang limits were deprived of their arms. Rebels, including Bakhtiari, have now again collected about Kazaz ^ ostensibly awaiting) Turkish reinforcements, and in the meantime plundering the country. . Hojabi)|s Sultaneh has succeeded in bringing the Mo^ioi section to his side and his attitude generally has been of value in preventing the spread of rebel movement. Amir Mofakham in retaliation seized Hojabr^’s brother, who was on the way to Tehran for medical treatment, and holds him prisoner at Areh. Ilojabr^ asked for squadron of Cossacks and one gun to help him in attack on Areh, but the request has been refused. “ As Hojabr^ is also threatened by Mazha^id Dowleh from Silakhor/ it will be difficult for him to send a contingent at present to join Russian troops. “ Russians are sending troops shortly to clear Araq when I expect situation will improve. “ Enemy force at Douletabad reported under 100 Turks and some Kermanshah gendarmes. “ At Di|abad, about 150 with a gun. “ Reported from Kermanshah that hundreds of sick are being transported there from Hamadan.

Please see Secretary of State’s telegram of 6th December reference to Bakhtiari. .My views in regard to several queries are as follows: — Firstly. Present indications do not give me reason to think active and organised hostility towards ourselves is likely on part of any considerable portion of tribesmen, and certainly not on part of whole tribe. There are several young hotheads among junior Khans who are not (Vunder.) effective control of seniors, and whose sympathies and activities are with the Turks but directed primarily against Russians. Their following is, however, small, and 1 believe that preponderant (dement amongst senior Khans would restrain them from active hostility against us. Secondly. It should be noted whereas north of latitude of Dizful effective Bakhtiari control or influence does not extend west of longitude 19, any Turkish advance from Kermanshah or Hamadan would in all probability be L n rz ^&gt; made between (pkvec corrupt groups4--nntd—Hdrtf through which lies easiest route between Kermanshah and Ispahan. Idea of such an advance has been in the air for some time, and Bakhtiari could not prevent it. and so long as Ispahan is the objective might even be tempted to connive at it Thirdly. I should say not more than brigandage. Fourthly. Until end of March such advance would be extremely Fifthlv About 5 000. There is believed to be scarcity of ammunition among tribesmen, but on other hand Turk/seem to find little difficulty in supplying their adherents with arms ami ammunition when occasion demands.I7h • ( i V. i From Political Officer, Basra, 2nd December 191(3.

Any agreement between Russians and subordinate Khans would appear superfluous in view of our agreement with the Elder Khans and might have inconvenient consequences in the future. It is difficult however to press the Russian Government to abstain from action which they may consider necessary to stem the Turkish advance in Persia. Might it not be possible to induce Russians to leave to us the responsibility for Bakhtiari relations with the two Powers by explaining to your Russian colleague the scope of our recent agreement with the Khans? Otherwise what means can you suggest for co ordinating British and Russian policy in Bakhtiaristan? Repeated to Petrograd No.2635.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. W.

Dear Mr. OlipHant:- I enclose copy of a letter received from Dr. Young By the mail last in the contents of v/hich will, I think, interest you. Yours, etc. , (Signed) 0. Greenway. Lancelot Oliphant, Esq., Foreign Office.MAIDAN-I-NAPHTUN, [ 30th September, 1916. Dear oir:- D/0 POLITICAL . In continuation of my letter of the 4th instant, I am glad to he able to report the result of the Khans T action against the Germans in Chahar Mahal. It will he remembered that instead of leaving that part t * of the country, as they had set out to do, the Germans and their followers took up fresh quarters at Deh-Kurd with the view of attaching Isfahan. The attach on the town was planned to emanate from three directions, hut the Germans had not much time for preparation, because Muhtashem was following them to Deh-Kurd with about two thousand men. So they fled into Isfahan territory. The Bahhtiari force reached the Chahar Mahal boundary, . and there tooh up a position in order to prevent a retreat by the enemy into Bahhtiari country. However, this did not deter the Germans from their planned attach on Isfahan. It failed completely. The Russian force in the town tooh them on, scattering them in all directions and tahing some prisoners with whom they i dealt in their own fashion. From all accounts, unless &gt; the Turhs come to their aid, I do not thinh that many of the Junior Khans will tahe up with glee any future attach on Isfahan. Where the rebels went I do not know, but they certainly did not get bach to Bahhtiari country. The General Manager, Messrs*. Strich Scott &amp; Company, Mohammerah.country. 6irdar Muhtashem has confiscated all the properties of the Junior Khans and others who joined the enemy. This was an excellent step and it passed off without incident. At present, 200 sov/ars still remain at Deh-Kurd to prevent the return of any of the defeated -uakhtiaris. The Isfahan road is now open, and, as far as I am aware, safe for traffic. Although we have not heen told so officially, it v/ould appear that the Turks did move a long distance out of Ramadan, to meet the opposing Russians. The latter were reinforced and we know now that they have repulsed the Turks v/ho have retreated 40 miles. The Russians are nov; 20 miles N.W. of Ramadan. As I hear that another Russian force is moving from Tabriz towards Sana, v/hich is about 50 miles North of Kermanshah, I do not think it will be long before we shall see the last of the Turkish column near Ramadan. With the Russians threatening Kermanshah from the North, the Turks must retreat or their line of communication will be cut. Bakhtiari Khans v. Kill . These two parties are traditional enemies, and although I do not believe that they will ever become friends, it v/ould be a great blessing if some working arrangement could be made between them. The Illkhani and Illbegi complain bitterly that no opportunity is lost by the Russians of 'getting at them', and they blame the Kill’s sons for provocation as the latter have the upper hand now. Accusations about robberies, interference v/ith taxation in disputed districts, etc., are matters which lead to continual friction. We may be sure of one thing. The Senior Khans, v/hatever their faults, steer clear of acts v/hich are likely to bring them into conflict with the Russians, for obvious reasons. In any case, it wouldwould tie difficult to substantiate cases of aggression which are perpetrated by robbers who have worried the Bakhtiaris themselves for years. These matters could, I think, be adjusted between the Russian Authorities in Isfahan and the Illkhani and Illbegi. If we could influence the Russians in this direction it would go a long way towards the removal of unnecessary friction, if not, as I surmise, actually tov/ards a lasting reconcilia tion. IflCAL . There is no news here. All is well and in the matter of safety, even as regards petty thefts on the Fields, we could not wish for a better summer. Dohrab Khan, our Head of Guards, has proved himself well able to deal with such matters, and Muhtashem T s influence over him has produced its good results. In his last letter to me Captain Noel writes: 'Muhtashem has been playing up splendidly. Mujahid’s behaviour has been what one might expect”. This speaks for itself. Yours faithfully, (Signed) M. Y. Young.Under Se Previous Under Se Secretary Commit ft &gt; MinuFrom Viceroy, Secret. Your telegram of the 20th instant, Bakhtiaris. For our general appreciation of the situation please see our telegram of the 20th instajat. We deprecate permanent location of a small regular force in Chahar Mahal as such small isolated forces are always potential source ofl&amp;isaster involving possible extension of operations for their extraction or punishment of assailants. We consider it important not to run suebrisks at present. Addressed to S. of S.,repeated to Tehran,Sykes and Cox.From \ iceroy, Foreign Department, 2()th September 1910. (Addressed 'reheran, Cox and Sykes.) Secret. Persia. Reference to Marling’s telegram to Foreign OiKce 612 F. of 16th September, our appreciation of position is as follows 1 concur the present danger in Persia is pressure on Ispahan by pro- German Bakhtiaris possibly reinforced by Turkish guns or troops. Fnemy success would imperil oil-helds and enibarass force T).” On other hand Shiraz is again becoming German rallying point ; but we have no colony there, and mischief will be local so long as Bakhtiaris are kept quiet. We think, therefore, Sykes should remain at Ispahan for the present. It is important, however, that he should avoid getting involved and suffering reverse. At same time hostility oi pro-British Bakhtiaris to Russians complicates situation, and makes it undesirable that Russians should enter Bakhtiari country with Sykes If he goes at all he should go alone. Moreover, it should if necessary politely be made clear to Russians that Sykes is not under Baratoff, as this might result in his being drawn north wards. Sykes’ true object, viz., to raise South Persia Rifles affords good reason. If foregoing views are accepted, we think that Gough and larman Farma should return to Ispahan at once. It is useless for Gough to remain exposed to danger at Abadeh. At the same time Kawam and Soulet should be made to understand that they will be held responsible for situation at Shiraz.From Sir P. Cox, Basra, 21st September 191G. (Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India.) (R.) 4823. Following from Noel, No. 436, dated 19th, received 21st:— “So far chief lever for keeping Bakhtiaris up to criterion has been • »ertrp+e that their good behaviour might make it possible for us to make things easier for them at Ispahan wit h Russians. After they had resi sted ternptataon~tolutack Ispahan and occasionyjeven take/action/which materially - upset German plan, and clearly showed that tribe as a whole had held strictly aloof from offensive movement, they and I had hopes that Russians might be ready to reconsider their attitude. “ As a result of conversation with Russian authorities here, I find that far from being prepared to relax their attitude, they are determined to increase its uncompromising severity. It is obvious that they are using the Zil-es- Sultan to put screw on Bakhtiaris, and keep it on. They have placed blockade on Bakhtiari, resulting in considerable financial loss to tribe, and they are oidy too ready to fall in with any scheme of Governor’s calculated to harry and exasperate them further. “ Russian Consul informed Grahame and me that after Azizabad fight question of punitive action against tribe had been raised, and Russian com mandant stated to me that it was only exhaustion of his horses and difficulty of moving his guns which deterred him from trailing his infantry through the heart of Chahar Mahal. “ Russians are either unwilling or unable to see Bakhtiari situation from our point of view. They do not realise that general Bakhtiari offensive on Ispahan, if it materialise, will probably lead to our having to protect oilfields. From Russian point of view of course Bakhtiari attack on Ispahan is of no great consequence, as its failure is foregone conclusion. “ As it seems impossible to get Russian authorities here to adopt reasonable attitude towards Bakhtiaris, I would again draw attention to remedy I have continuously suggested since arrival in July, viz., posting of small regular force in Chahar Mahal, so as to prevent repetition of such incidents as the march (of) German Charge d’Affaires'following on Ispahan, and thus control Bakhtiari relations with Russia. “ With this consideration in view, I trust proposal mentioned in Sykes’s j telegram No. 632 C. will be adopted, but at the same time I would point out that what is required is a permanent force in Chahar Mahal. “ Addressed to Tehran, repeated to Basra, Ispahan, and Sykes. ’ JfjIndia Office, Whitehall.

German plan appears to have comprised comoined operation between band under Kardof and force of Chiragh AXi Khan noted brigand who was in German pay last year and a contingent supplied by sisuer of Samsan~es~Sultaneh but plan seems to have failed for the present owing to destruction of Chiragh s band by Russians at place 5 or 6 miles outside Ispahan and to Captain Noe^s successful influence with Ilkhani. But considerable forces are reported to be moving in the neighbourhood of Ispahan. Noel mistrusts Ilbegi and I think as soon as 1 situation clears sufficiently Amir IviUjahid must be i replaced by Amir Jang Sirdar Assad's second son. I have some reason to suspect that party of Zil~es~Sultan in Ispahan is endeavouring to implicate Khans in Teheran with hostile movement but with possiole exception of Sams an-es-Suitaneh who is capable of any foolish vagary I think Khans here are too cautious tohave taken any action that might commit them so long as the two Legations remain in Teheran,. As usual they profess great friendship hut they are much per turbed undoubtedly tit prospect of return of Zil-es- Sultan to Ispahan or rather pretend to be so as they like everyone else here recognize that H.

Captain Noel is with ruling Khans at summer quarters near Ispahan, and his telegrams up to 25th August show that so far Said Khans and friendly element in tribe have remained reasonably staunch ( ? ) Noel feels confident of being able to maintain strong pro-British element’ provided ruling Khans are supported with munitions of war and money. Location of small regular force in Chahar Mahal is also advocated by him if these oil fields general situation being as above actual despatch of a force to oil fields does not appear necessary at present. On the other hand, friendly natives are no doubt pursuing an up-hill task and may not be able to maintain present position if they do not receive support from us, I understand that His Majesty’s Minister also favours this. In order, therefore, to meet joint requirements of both cases it is proposed to inform Noel that we are arranging to send up a consignment of 500 rifles with 100 rounds per rifle, and that he can have any funds which may be necessary for greasing wheels and enabling Khans to keep their adherents together. We should also inform him that garrison at Ahwaz is being reinforced in order that we may be prepared for eventualities, but that no further action as regards movements of troops is at present contemplated.

Government of India’s telegram 269 S. to Secretary of State for India seems to be based on misconception of state of affairs in Kerman and Shiraz.4 £ I y All my mform^on as regards Kerman goes to show German e£fort is spent and that so tar as security goes condition of province is not far from normal so that arrival of Sykes with even a small force of gendarmes and bis own escort should establish authority of Government on a better footing than for some years past.

At assmuss alone remains at liberty and I can see no trace of him retaining any influence un ess perhaps in refusal of rebellious Khans to releaso prisoneis. If m Shiraz itself matters have not improved so far as could be wished -fT 6 l he f, W f- I 0 Governor or ^Pity Governor with sufficient authority to control local intrigues and jealousies hut even so I have been able to secure re-arrest of the prisoners released by Soulet’s influence which shows that Government authority exists while since the arrival three days ago of P(arman) F(arma) s Deputy there is a change for the better though he came alone and without any kind of armed force. Even now I believe that British officers could travel with a very modest escort from Kerman to Shiraz bv a more direct route than that suggested by Government of India or even from Bunder Abbas without any serious danger. It would be unnecessary for them to take money with them as I hope to see Imperial Bank of Persia reopon at Shiraz by time they could arrive. F(arman) i'(arma) is quite confident that within two months of his arrival he will have province well in hand and I can (see ?) no reason to doubt it but he will have done it by usual undesirable Persian methods. Credit and prestige would be his and there would be no opportunity of military opera tions which the Government of India count upon to restore our prestige. Under the circumstances it seems to me that the risks forseen (by ?) Government of India are small and as compared with advantages to be gained may properly be taken. &amp; 8 Addressed to Foreign Office; repeated to Sir P.

No effective action seems to have been taken by Persian Government, and our detention seems likely to continue indefinitely unless Your Excellency can devise some means for our release. Majority of people here are heartily sick of whole business and will welcome settlement. I venture to suggest that, if Persian Government are not in position to despatch actual force to effect our release, they should at least depute Mamur to represent either Central Government or Soulet. Arrival of such individual here would produce great effect and matters could certainly be arranged after few days’ negotiations probably on basis of simple exchange of prisoners. Failing this and assuming that Indian Government are not in position to employ force themselves, I suggest that matter should be treated as simple case of brigandage, and that we should be ransomed out of hands of brigands as has frequently had to be done in cases of British subjects held to ransom in other countries. Such course, howevery undesirable from some points of view, would surely be preferable to our indefinite detention here. As long as we are here this district remains focus for unrest and intrigue which infects all Southern Persia and it affords place of refuge for murderers and rebels; and continued detention of British Cousul and other British subjects by petty Khans actually within sight and hearing of Bushire must be increasingly prejudicial to our prestige. Once we are released these two Khans lose all fictitious importance whiclf they have derived from rebel movements in south, and can be easily dealt with in exemplary manner at any time later on when it suits us. ” Ends, Addressed Minister; repeated Basrah.5 Enclosure No. 2.

I presume Earman Earma’s Deputy could send Mamur; if so, as O’Connor thinks, he might be useful perhaps you would arrange. There is no doubt inaction of our force here has a very bad effect, but in view of decision of Government there appears to be no help for it.

The Shaikh having pressed me to meet Ilkhani and Ilbegi with him and they themselves having expressed wish for meeting I agreed, subject to condi tion that agreement had first been signed at Fields and Saiyid Isa handed over at Ahwaz. As regards agreement, Muhtasham was ready to comply forthwith ; JMujahid haggled for a bit on ground that situation had been altered by Russian occupation of Ispahan but eventually complied. Great difficulty was ex perienced in getting Khans to make good their undertakings regarding Saiyid Isa, but he was eventually brought down in motor car by Noel and Shaikh Hanzal and handed over to Shaikh of Mohammerah’s custody. Shaikh proceeded to Band-i-Kir and brought them to Ahwaz where gathering took place on 23rd and 24th, the Ilkhani and Ilbegi and junior Khans, Shaikh and Haji Rais, Consular Officers and self and Dr. Young being present. Relations between Ilkhani and Ilbegi had recently been very bad and up to the time of their arrival at Ahwaz they had spent most of their time in recriminations and intrigues against each other and threats of resignation, but when we met they had benefitted by their preliminary conversations with Shaikh and become more amenable. I insisted that having been appointed Ilkhani and Ilbegi through our recommendation and support and having just made a specific bargain with us for value received, it was ridiculous that they should thus be sparring among themselves and talking of resignation. It was their bounden duty to cease recrimination, sink differences and work in complete accord publicly and privately for the effective performance of their functions and the fulfilment of their obligations to us. Two days’ friendly gathering did much to clear the air and create good feeling and they eventually gave me joint writing in which each gives his word to abide by above injunctions and cease all talk of resignation; to refer any obstinate personal difficulty to friendly arbitration of British representative, and to work steadfastly on above lines so long as they have reasonable support from us.

The particular forms of support which they ask for are— Firstly, that Vice-Consul with his sowars should join them in Chahar Mahal forthwith. Secondly, that you send them an open letter or telegram setting forth that they have been appointed Ilkhani and Ilbegi with our support and approval; that it is incumbent on the other Khans to support their authority and that any Khan opposing or intriguing against them will be regarded by us as disloyal to Central Government and hostile to British interests and will incur our active displeasure. Thirdly : They believe that if they have our active support as above they will be able to hold their own and the other Khans will gradually come to reason. They also believe that they would then be strong enough to capture or expel any remnants of German parties remaining or taking refuge in Bakhtiari country. They state however that should the Turks by any chance give the Russians a set-back on the Kermanshah line and re-enter Persia, acute dis affection among Bakhtiaris might'recrudesce and in latter case it would be essential that they should be supplied by us with arms and ammunition without which they would be unable to maintain their position and the interests of the Central Government and ourselves. I have told them that in my opinion the forms and conditions of support which they ask for as above described are reasonable and that I am communicating them to you with my support. Further they beg me to remind you that, in view of the hereditary feud I which exists between the Bakhtiari tribe and the Zil-es-Sultan, it cannot be expected that the return to the Government of Ispahan of a member of the Zil’s family as a permanency will be willingly accepted by the tribe. They know they have themselves to thank for what has happened and for some time to come they cannot and do not hope for more than the appointment of a neutral official to the Governorship. But they beg me to recall to you your remark in your telegram to Muhtashara, dated 23rd March, that Ispahan was lost to them “ for a while ” and to express their earnest hope that you will use your influence as soon as opportunity offers to secure the appointment of a neutral official. As regards first item, Noel is available and in circumstances I would propose to send him forthwith. As regards second item, as far as I can see the issue of such a communi cation is expedient and unobjectionable, and if you concur I tiust you will see fit to send letter to Grahame for delivery to them and send them a brief telegram to Ahvvaz to say you are doing so. As regards item three, the contingency is, I hope, improbable, but in event of its occurring practical assistance of the kind would be feasible and necessary and I trust you can give them an encouraging reply. As regards item four, I can only observe that the effect of the permanent appointment oka son of the Zil w r ouid no doubt be in the direction they indi cate and if it is possible to confirm the suggestion that the present arrangement is only temporary, it would no doubt have a soothing efi'ect on the Bakhtiari situation. _8 The Khans also reiterated their protest against Amir Mufakham’s action communicated to you m my telegram 2381 and begged me to move you to take up the matter strongly with Central Government and Sardar Jang and get peremptory orders sent to Mufakham to desist. In view of the assurances given me by the two Khans that they will act solidly and loyally together in our interests I think we should do our best to pupport them in this matter and get Mufakham suppressed. I should be grateful for an early telegram before Khans leave Ahwaz intimating, if possible, your general readiness to afford support in the direc- tions above indicated.

It was also necessary in our military interests to clear position and arrive at some definite working understanding with therm Having regard therefore to views expressed in your telegram above quoted action was taken on tbe following lines. ^ o I took a writing from the Khans in which they undertake to recognise authonty of Deputy Governor at Dizful and Shushter appointed by the Central Government and disclaim any title or aspiration on their own part to hll those posts except it he in circumstances where such a course had our approval. At the same time as between themselves and us they remind me that they have tor years supplied a detachment of sowars for the maintenance of cider and support of Government’s authority ; their salaries being paid by Finance Department from local revenues.

At our interview on the subject of Bakhtiari and Behbehan matters we gave you a verbal promise that the friction and misunderstanding which existed between us bad been removed and that in future we would undertake to work together loyally and wholeheartedly. We now repeat to you in writing that, in accordance with the agreement which has just been signed, we give you a definite and solemn promise that in future we will carry out our duties in complete unison and harmony and we will abstain from all intrigue to the prejudice of good order. As long as we enjoy the support of the British Government and its officials, we will not resign our appointments but will continue our work with vigour. If in future disputes or differences of opinion should arise, we will have them settled by the nearest representative of the British Government so that they may be arranged with amity and unity. We trust that this agreement will not be broken in any way. This has been written for your information. We take this opportunity to renew the expression of our friendly senti ments. (Seal.) Yusuf.

Cox, His Majesty's Resident and Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, dated the 23rd May 1916. Jfter compliments .—Your Honour is doubtless aware of the position as regards Bakhtiari interests at Shushter and Dizful which has obtained up to the present. In the light of recent happenings in these parts it has rather seemed to us that your representative was inclined to act in a way calculated to prejudice those interests. We have recently discussed this matter with Captain Noel and from what he says it would seem that if, in fact, your representative has been acting in the way suggested, the reason for his so doing was solely attributable to the fact that some of the Bakhtiari Khans and their dependents had joined and were assisting our enemies, and that in consequence the British authorities were suspicious of the attitude of the Bakhtiari. Khans in Shushter and Dizful are uncertain whether they intended to co-operate with and oppose them. But now with the agreement between us and the British Legation freshly signed there can remain no doubt in your mind as to our sitcerity and friendship. You will doubtless agree with us that our interests at Shushter and Dizful should be protected since those interests are common to yourselves, we therefore take this opportunity to request that the former position as regards Shushter and Dizful may be restored. The position to which we refer is as follows. We, the Khans, recognise the authority of the Deputy Governor appointed either direct by the Persian Government or by the Governor-General, Arabistan, with the Persian Government’s approval. We ourselves lay no claim to the government of those places except it be with the approval of the representative of the British Government. As Your Honour is aware however we have up to now been in the habit of furnishing a detachment of sowars for the mainten ance of law and order and the support of the Government, and the wages of these sowars have been met from the revenues of Dizful and Shushter and collected through the Finance Department. We now trust that the represent atives of the British Government and yourself will accept and approve this arrangement.We undertake that our representatives, and sowars in addition to the performance of the duties they owe to the Persian Government, will afford ;all possible help and assistance to the British authorities in their business such for example as the purchase of mules, the collection of supplies and labour. Further, we undertake that we will make the appointment of the Head of the sowars in consultation with the British authorities and if he should prove unsatisfactory to agree to replace him. In return we hope that we shall enjoy your support and good offices in recovering regularly and without delay from the local authorities the wages of the sowars. [Seal.] Ghttlam Husain.

Polio wing has been received from Doctor Young (?) dated 9th December and telegraphed on December 13th from oil-fields:— Begins. Addressed to Ahwaz, Tehran, Basrah and Kut-al-Amarah. I have concluded agreement with Illkhani and Illbegi, countersigned by Amir Jang Murtaza Kule Khan. Junior Khans assented to it. Summary of paper is as follows :— Begins. “Illkhani and Illbegi, in the event of war with Persia, guarantee to safeguard Company’s interests with all power at their command and in accordance with former contract between them and the Company. Company shall have right to continue working as before subject to fortnight’s notice with safe conduct to Ahwaz should Khans no longer have power to protect Company’s interests. Ilikhani and Illbesri so long as Persian Government remains neutral undertake to prohibit entry into Bakhtiari country of any European or their representatives whose object is to cause mischief and intrigue. Should any of them come unexpectedly under any pretext they will be expelled from Bakhtiari country by force.” Bnds. Paper as originally presented by me was accepted by Muhtasham but refused by Mujahid who objected to mention of Germans in last paragraph substituting word Europeans. Otherwise meaning is clear. Owing to un certainty of the Persian Government’s action later Khans could not guarantee expulsion of Germans after declaration of War without a previous undertak ing with the British Government regarding Bakhtiari neutrality. On this point they were prepared to negotiate. I have arranged in view of situation in province for immediate appoint ment of two Junior Khans to remain here to prevent and any (any ?) movement south, in absence of Illkhani. In consideration of foregoing I have given Illkhani 1,500 and Illbegi 1,000 am uncertain of the latter.

' As to minor events nearer Tehran there is some evidence of a skirmish near Saveh. At Hasanabad Gendarmerie are drilling daily and practising musketry under Erick.

From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Addressed to Foreign Office. Sent to India and Petrograd.) Persian Cabinet has decided to retain office and to endeavour to conciliate public opinion with a statement (that ?) an offensive alliance against Turkey is not contemplated. I do (?) not think their efforts will do anything to improve situation, which depends on success of operations of Russian General Officer Commanding. Government is quite powerless. They cannot send message central and southern provinces, telegraphs being in hands of Germans. Even if they could their instructions are not obeyed. Germans have a very considerable force of local levies of little or no military value compared with their numbers, but by their means they control all Persia south of Yezd, Kum, Sultanabad, Kermanshah line. Even north of this line dcmocrats(?) are so active in German interests that Government’s authority is very slender, while south of it and in Kerman whole population is cut off from all but German news as to events in and out of Persia. This news is dressed up to suit German interests, and population is wholly under German influence in consequence. It is to be assumed therefore that German levies will be increased largely (I know indeed for a fact a considerable force, including even Bakhtiari, has started for Kum from Ispahan) so that it is probable enemy force may soon reach a figure too great to be crushed at once by Russian General Officer Com- maudinff’s kroons which have to operate over a very wide front and against —- SJ I* c a • * ' * •» ^ •In any further communication on the subject, please quote n„.

Orders had also been sent to me to destroy Cypher Code rc P In event of a similar crisis recurring and developing unfavourably the Officer Commanding column and I have no clear orders as to what we should do. The Baluch Sardars of Sistan are, I believe, inimical to the present Governor Shaukat-ul-Mulk and thoroughly disloyal to the Persian Government. If they were assured that they would not be punished at the termination of the war or if we announced our intention of annexing the province they will side with us ; Though really preferring British rule to that of either Afghanistan or Persia they would desert us if Afghanistan also entered the war on the side of our enemies. If Baluch Sardars join us and Afghanistan remains neutral lour position here would be secure until Germans and Turks arrive in force, but if jehad is taken up at once by the Afghans we should, I think, have to make as quickly as possible for British territory hardly waiting for the contingent at Birjand who perhaps would do better to go to Meshed and join the Bussians. Telegraphic communication would presumably be cut on or even before the outbreak of hostilities.

His surrender was demanded by the Acting Karguzar, but I replied to the effect that so long as the presence of British and Russian troops was required in Persia for the maintenance of peace and to prevent our enemies’ Agents from obtaining access into Afghanistan I declined even by one man to reinforce our enemies.

Reference my telegram immediately preceding. Minis ter of Education called last night about 9-30 and stayed till 1-20 a.m. He said he had been sent by Cabinet to obtain answers on two points {a) on what terms we would withdraw troops to Kasvin and (5) on what terms were we prepared to negotiate for Persia’s benevolent neutrality on terms communi cated by Minister for Foreign Affairs to us. There was, I said, little to add as regards («) to what Russian Minister and I had already told Minister for Foreign Affairs, that is that it did not lie (? with) us. It seemed to me as if hint thrown out by Minister for Foreign- Affairs about Government retiring to Ispahan was nothing but a threat ( ? that) if we did not agree to Persia’s requirements in return for her bene volent neutrality, Persia would throw in her lot with Germany. I was not much impressed by threat as I was convinced Shah would not care to take left seat in Prince Reuss carriage and I knew Cabinet did not wush to see Persia involved in war which could only have results for ber which would be disastrous. If in its profess (ions ?) towards us Government was sincere it should have the courage to declare its policy openly and let the world know that it frankly accepted our assurances (that) the troops had been moved merely to insure safety of Legation, etc , and had no purpose of an unfriendly kind. We had by according moratorium already given proof of our friendliness and we must have some corresponding sign from Persia. His Excellency said that the approach of troops might have disastrous effects in provinces. I retort (ed ?) that position of our Consuls could hardly be worse than it is if there is any objection to entirely passive attitude of Government and gendarmerie’s open hostility. As to {h) whole thing looked like blackmail but we were now in a position of defence ? ? I replied ? ? and to ask us to abandon that advantage was ridiculous. If troops now withdrew to Kasvin I should pro bably be in same plight myself as Consul, Shiraz, who has not been able to leave his garden for two months. That position I declined to accept. Nearer troops came the better I should be pleased. As to substance of Persian proposals the more I thought of them the less I understood spirit in which they had been framed. To accept them in principle as he suggested sounded well but any acceptance at all as regards two of them was fully impossible (?) I would communicate them to you and report your reply to Persian Government. It was significant that Minister said little or nothing about departure to Ispahan and so long as we stand fast and allow troops to move nearer situation may be saved. If we show weakness it certainly will be lost.

This morning Russian Minister and I met Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs by appointment. Ministers dilated at great length on necessity for conciliating public opinion and upon recall of troops to Kasvin. They said, that as soon as that was done, and two Governments had agreed to discuss terms on which Persia would adopt benevolent neutrality, Persian Government would declare their determination to put an end to German intrigues, etc., publicly. We said that movement of troops was not under our control and that situation here in any case did not warrant their withdrawal. Persian Government had promised to remove Austrian prisoners and take other mea sures but had done absolutely nothing but provide few guards armed with unserviceable rifles for defence of Legation. Orders to troops could not be modified in these circumstances. Meanwhile as to proposed negotiations we might expect instructions from our Governments. By accepting moratorium Persian Government had practically pledge^ themselves to benevolent neutra lity and had no cause whatever to regard presence of troops as unfriendly. If Government was sincere in their professions they would at once make this clear to public and our Governments. Minister said that they could not take such a step in face of public opinion. We parted with an understanding that so long as Mujahidin are not dis armed troops would not move back. Persian Government say that until after 10th Moharrem, November 18th, this cannot be safely done. 80 mules left town last night it is believed for Hamadan and I can in form that all German officers here did the same.It would seem certain mules were utilized to carry to Hamadanarms, etc., mentioned in my immediately preceding telegram and if this is so Govern ment had already connived at this move. German Minister has left his Legation and lives in house adjoining United States Legation. To-day attitude of Minister was entirely unsatisfactory and (?) I think troops should without delay move nearer to Tehran. Sent to India, Petrograd, addressed to Poreign Office. 36 Telegram P., No/84-D.

Please refer to your telegram 245 of the 8th November. I fail to under stand the advantage of diversion suggested. The Germans it appears are making for Afghanistan in two parties from Nain and Kerman respectively and I suspect that they may have with them northern party and a wireless apparatus brought from Baghdad via Ispahan. They cannot with tribesmen alone make much impression against either Kacha or Sistan and to weaken our line between Kain and Sistan would seem to be play(ing) (the) German game. I have an idea that the most important party of enemy will come through Naiband and the lesser party will make for Neh. They will probably try to amalgamate eventually, in which case the northern party will I think pass south of Birjand. Our Sistan and Birjand detachments have a most difficult task to intercept these two parties owing to the fact that the Germans travel so fast and that it is almost^ impossible to get adequate notice of movement of the more northern parties. Wh rely chiefly as regards lesser party upon news through you from Bavar and Khabis but we have also got scouts at Deh Salm and are sending others to Khabis^ Until he is joined by some Germans with machine guns, Jehind cannot, I think, help our enemies beyond wrecking telegraph line and office(s) at Dehaneh Baghit and Bam. - - ~ -- —-12 39 Telegram P., dated (and received) the 12th November 1915.

A report has been received by the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, from the Inspector working between Bushire and Shiraz that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and the Manager of the Bank at Shiraz have been made prisoners by gendarmerie acting on orders from Tehran and (taken ?) towards Bushire. Orders have issued to the Kawam and Soulet to attack Bushire. The Swedish gendarmerie officer was not at Shiraz.

(Addressed Foreign Office, London, repeated to Petrograd, Basrah and Bushire.) With reference to my immediately preceding telegram, I have heard from Minister for Foreign Affairs who denies all knowledge of any such occur rences at Shiraz. The story it is just possible is a German invention made up with the object of influencing events at the capital. A story of very much the same kind was circulated here regarding Hamadan which proved entirely without foundation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked in the most friendly way and asked whether Russian Minister and I mistrusted the present Cabinet. If we did so a Cabinet could easily be formed that would enjoy our confidence. The Shah, he declar ed, had no intention of leaving the capital. The Persian Government seems to be on the point of coming over to us. The German Agents are still moving from Tehran and their flight has naturally shaken the belief in them. There is also an exodus of their adherents. 41 Telegram P., No. R.-339, dated the 12th (received 13th) November 1915.

The great importance of preventing as long as possible the news from becoming public in the event of a rupture with Persia, is again urged by the Consul, Mohammerah,—in order to give the Sheikh time to assemble the heads of tribes. In the cases of other friendly elements the same considerations apply. It would appear that the only effective means of securing this would be to seize the Persian telegraph offices at Tehran as early as possible. Can Director make any suggestions as to particular measures which could be taken in the provinces.

Please see your telegram 284-C. An informer of mine who has had confidential talk with Daood Ali and another Indian who is addressed by them as Professor, reports having decided against trying to get through in small parties (of) six ; they mean to make the next attempt in force : that Jehind has promised them assistance: the route through Deh Salm is that selected : and Zugmeyer will join them from here. This person was some time among the Baluchis. It appears from the reports from Yezd that all the Germans are collected there. My opinion is that they will come on by Zarand Pass north cf here either to Khabis or a point near it where they trust to meet the Baluchis: while Zugmeyer with 100 to 150 Persians will probably join on as they pass. Special sowars have been posted by me at the road due north of here and I will try to send you information of exact route taken as early as possible. Further an arrangement has been made by me for an attack on Jehind’s home by his enemies in the customary course and I thought that you might perhaps to able to take similar action in the north in order to draw him back to his own country. 45 Telegram P., dated the 12th (received 18th) November 1915.

S. of the 8th November. I fear it may not later on be practicable to get Sardars on our side if ground is no now thoroughly prepared. Ten days ago at my request Sardar Khudad-ad Khan sent one hundred and fifty camels to Nushki but he was cautioned against doing this and threatened by both Deputy Governor and late Revenue Director. Several other Baluch notables have offered to supply me with sowars and riflemen to oppose Germans. They do not at present take Germans seriously but news is beginning to filter in about Jehind joining Germans and large number of Bakhtiaris on Germans side. Consequently Sistan Sardars may begin to think official policy (of) neutrality more politic and unless we haven previously bound them whole heartedly by liberal treatment to our side if their country eventually is dragged into war they will have to follow. May I commence entertaining sowars and riflemen up to two hundred from tribes which I consider most trustworthy and inform their Sardars at once that British liovernment will safeguard them and levies whom they supply to us from Persian Government’s anger ? As latter are permitting Germans freely to entertain Persians against us it does not seem that Persian Government can object though local authorities may do so.

Knowledge that our friends will stand by us and that we are acquiring new friend(s) will on the contrary influence Persian Government more favourably towards us. Germans are making great effort(s) to bring about movement in many parts of the country in their favour but until Persian Government has taken a decision here any great success in that manner is doubtful.

Box’s telegram No. 1082 B. In respect of those of a general character and referring to protection of British interests it would not I think be impossible to obtain from Khans here Witten assurances without giving any special under taking in return on our part but with such under taking Khans would always find pretexts for evading fulfilment of their assurances if tney should deem it advantageous. Same observations apply also as regards a pledge from them to libe on good terms with i the Sheikh of Po hammer ah. Question of Liravi is different. Khans ambitions in that direction are v/ell known and only two days ago they sounded me as to acquiring it by purchase. I question v/hether inducements His Majesty ’ s Government arc now prepared to hold out to ohern ’would suffice r PERSIA . POLITICAL . Decyphrr Mr. Marling (Teheran) October 7thA guarantee of internal autonomy v/ould be valueless in the eyes of the Khans as notion of any interference in tribal administration is a contingency quite unthinkable to them. Ue might however succeed in representing guarantee of their territory as advantageous although it is possible that Khans might see in it a limitation of their future expansion especially when taken in con junction with our stipulation respecting Lipavi. Contemplated promise of assistance to them to obtain Governorships might prove embarrassing to us in the future for when neutral zone disappears only available provinces in our gift will be Yezd and Kerman. The one solid attraction for ine Khans in Sir P. • Cox's original suggestion was guarantee of Governor ships of Ispahan and that being now ruled out small residue would give compact little value in their eyes. Moreover question of Ispahan is of such import ance to tnem it would inevitably come up in the course of negotiations and no evasion on our part would avail bo present Khans from deducing from our refusal to give gaa^antee respecting Governorship the con clusion that Ispahan is to fall definitely under hussian influence. Effect on our relations with them would be disastro£ 3. Consul General Graham' could not conduct neg otiations witn ilkhani and ilbeggi for reasons given in- (? your telegram). Negotiations would have to be initiated in Teheran where tne two most important Khans now are and mere they will very soon be joined by Sirdav Jang, I think it will be impossible to negotiate with Tribe without letting them and all Persia see too far in to our hand and that we can probably get assurances on somesome of the points suggested by Sir P. Cox without running above risk though I do not attach much value to such assurances even if obtained, I would suggest as a more practical and less dangerous course that Pr. Graham and Dr. Young in Bakhtiaristan (? and I) in Teheran endeavour to keep tribe lo$pl by Secret Service inducements. Khans are showing a more satisfactory disposition here than for sometime past.

In these circumstances it would ob viously be undesirable to commit ourselves in promises which might be inconsistent with rights o ’ Russian Gov ernment in Russian sphere and governorship of Ispahan must not therefore be promised though His Majesty’s Government might and probably would use good offices on behalf of Khans.

September 23rd Dr 9 pri'/ir, September 23rd 193iD Kc 12 noon September 24 t}i 1915 P NOr 358, Sir Pr Cox's telegram to Government of India Nor 2068 br repeated to Secretary of State P Sir P P Cox is of course in a far better position to judge of expediency of proposed compact with Bakhti-^ri from a military point of view than I am, and as regards political aspect I quite concur thrt aiiy agreement that caji bind tribe more closely to our interests would be of great value. I feel however grave doubts whether it would be possible to negotiate such a compact within any useful time and I am inclined to think that in urging that pres ent moment is an opportune one Sir p r Cox has not before him all the facts in the present situation. In the first place he assumes that the Anir Jang has been appointed Illbegi, This is not so; he is merely acting temporarily as such and definite appointment is still under discussion. Still even if definite appoint ment were made Illkhani and Illbegi would not have nower t .... j. to negotiate compact of this kind; in practice their authority is limited to internal affairs of the tribe and pact of kind suggested would have to be submitted to the other senior Khans and their assent obtained. Khans are scattered and much time would be lost in discussions between them. SamsanSamsam and Baliadur (latter practically acta for hir, fa.st failLig father Sirdar Asaad) who represent one of the cnief branches of *ohe tribe are now here and '/hen tentatively sounded as to possibility of closer relations with us gave very guarded reply and I think it extremely unlikely although their attitude has bee r L more satisfac tory for the lant for/ days that they will abandon their deternina.tion to do nothing in their relations with us without knowledge and approval of Government. They are indeed nervously anxious not to be looked on as actively pro-British ^so much so that they have actually refused uo accept from ne money required to pay forces for which Government have asked then to (?desp*tch to)Teheran and Ispanan and have preferred to fiiid it themselves, rely ing on my re-imbursing tjiem later ( and then only in the shape of a loan through Lmperial Bank of Persia) if Government cannot do so. So long^ ?s these two Khans a re In this fra me of ni nd it seems to ne to be hopeless to expect that they would agree to a pact proposed stipulations ol wliich could not be approved by Govern ment r There is even less to be hoped from Khans at Ispa han r Though I scarcely believe they would take active steps against us, they would be even less willing than Samsar and Bahadur to declare themselves openly with us which they would have of course to do by entering into negotiations with us, tlie fact could not be kept secret. They are very much under the Impression of Germ an boasts of victory, of (group undecipherable ?tneir being) invi^icible, and of local Influence which Gerr anGerman display of force and contempt for Persian auth ority has achieved at Ispahan hut they, like their relatives,here, axe still awaiting course of events and a decisive suc cess on our sid e would bring them over at once to us r Like the rest of Persia they want to be on the winning side. Sir p f Cox's prpppsal appears to me to offer very slender hopes of success and I think a safer course will be to endeavour to secure Khans loyaltv bv wifts and promises of more gifts and by guaranteeing a.i^ expenditure they may incur at request, or v^ith assent, of Persian Cfoverniient, and I think by this means we may succeed in securing something more than their beie- volent neutrality without assuming obligations that might prove inconvenient later.

Giving assurance to new Ilkani and Ilbegi that they will be retained in their appointments for five years, we should stipulate, of course, for good conduct and loyalty, and add that if through no fault of theirs they are ousted from appointments we will compensate them accordingly.Military Secret. 274 From General Nixon, Amara, 19th September, 1015.

From the military point of view 1 regard the intelligence therein contained with the ntmost satisfaction, affecting as it does the question of protection of oil fields and the general security (?) and of Bakhtiari border. If the Ilkhani and )egi make good their promise of pro-British co-operation, and if recently arranged&gt;4awi subsidy secures the result anticipated, there appears every reason to hope that safety of oil fields will be permanently assured without need for any further call for reinforcements on that side. I therefore give strongest possible support to Sir I\ Cox’s suggestion that the situation ca s for a prompt reply from flis Majesty’s Government, conveying assurances to Ilkhani and Ilbegi, and I urge that no time be lost in sanctioning the action he advocates.—«■ From Sir P.

In regard to last-named telegram however, as anticipated in my b Hu*. telegram T. 13 dated 22nd May, I would point out that events have shown clearly that cash payments do not serve purpose and that Bakhtiari require, as I think is natural, something more substantial and enduring. I trust, therefore, that 1 may be authorised, whilst omitting all reference to their obtaining access to Persian Gulf littoral, to negotiate with them on lines above suggested. Preliminary communications could conveniently be exchanged through the Sheikh of Mohammerah through whom Khans have approached me. , As regards promise of assistance in obtaining Governois^ the only essential is Ispahan, which is in their sphere and on which they have in practice an undoubted lien, and in regard to which they are 1 think entitled to claim our assistance, especially as there is some reason to hope Ispahan will eventually be recognised as part of our sphere.

(2040 11 ?.) This morning [ discussed situation in Arabistan with Sheikh of Mohammera with particular reference to proceedings of German parties and the attitude of the Bakhtiari Khans. As regards his personal relations with his tribesmen, viz. : Bani/Turuf, Uhab, Baud, Muhaisin, he felt that his general position was more favourable and satisfactory at the present moment than it had been for live years past. Referring to the attitude of Bakhtiari, he showed me the following telegram from Samsam/' Teheran, to IIkhani and lllbegi^ iointly assuring them that by (cordial ?; consent of Khans as a whole they were assured of undisturbed enjoyment of their appointments for at least five years to come, and were given full power to take necessary steps to control Bakhtiari and Kuhgalu under their jurisdiction, giving them stringent orders and explicit instructions to proceed south as soon as possible and made arrangements for maintenance of order and security in their boundaries. Second telegram was a lengthy joint message in cypner from llkhani their appointment, incils of the tribes, and then going on to assure Sheikh of their readi ness t o co-operate with ^ him in their joint affairs and to join him in^to obtain assurances from us L ”V- that they would be retained in their appointments for five years. In connection with above can any prompt reply by telegraph be conveyed on unAt Ac /] behalf of IBs Majesty’s Government either by Minister or myself in the ^ AtcLj above sense ? I trust it may be possible. As regards activities of Germans, Sheikh expressed the view that such small parties as these could not move openly with hostile intentions without an escort of Bakhtiari sowars, and having regard to the attitude of the llkhani and Illbegi above mentioned, lie was of opinion all they would get would be a few adherents of the Sirdar dang to whom friendly Bakhtiari woidd be opposed. Sheikh considered that most tlmy could do would be to break up into twos or threes and disguise themselves and endeavour to incite sympathisers to isolated acts of lawlessness. He agreed that party of brigands needed watching and would assist to that end,—but did not consider that these scattered Germans were good for more than that.

(Addressed Foreign, repealed to India Office, Minister and Hnshire.) (M.) F. 13. Please see series of telegrams beginning with my No. 1081, and comments of the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at 1 eh ran thereupon. 1 hey are doubtless in a position to appraise situation from a longer and more detached standpoint than I can, but I respectfully submit following further observations. Past autumn when we were expecting wai with 1 uikey, and when military authorities in India expressed opinion that our resources were fully occupied and that troops could not be spared for Persian Gulf, we did not hesitate to discount lacts by making reassuring announcements to Arab potentates of the Gulf, and by offering inducements to Koweit, Mohammerah, and Basra notables in order to make sure of their co-operation or benevolent neutrality. Position seems to me to be much the same now in case of Persia. Prana facie we have no troops to spare where with to support our friends or protect our interests. I submit, therefore, that natural alternative is to offer practical inducements to elements which are now friendly in order to ensure their benevolent neutrality, and if possible obtain their co-operation, and thus discount hostility of doubtful elements, disbursement of periodical secret service doles and other alter native propositions by Government of India will not, I fear, be either practicable or sufficient for the purpose. Our friends can look after themselves and prevenr spread of hostilities provided they receive sufficient inducement to repay them for risk and odium entailed. If we take no action on lines suggested, we must face possibility of these friendly elements leaving us, and consequently create much more serious situation, necessitating military dispositions on a proportionately larger scale than those contemplated by Government of India.(Addrei Foreign 1083 B, of K Until a r friendly repr* ollicers and c&lt; can he encou already authc If unforti should leave liave troops , commit ourse in a mesh of i arise, Soulet ; in the event and he prom is services herea outbreak of \ de facto rule] ourselves.

FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS From Sir P. Cox, l Oth May 1915. (Addressed foreign, repeated Tehran, Bushire, Ispahan, and India Office.) IOSl* R Reference to Minister, Tehran, I6J to Foreign Office. Following- i~ : out look as regards Baklitiaris. Sirdar Jang and Bahadur are at Dizful. ( have exchanged friendly letters with them regarding Arabistan affairs an i i )yer s murder, but representative thev sent down to see me was not plenipotentiary, and neither Sheikh of Alohammerah nor 1 felt able to discuss any secret or important matters with him. I am awaiting opportunity to meet them at Ramuz very soon. -Sii dar Jang &gt; attitude, however, m regard to incursion of Turkish troops, fanatical n„s&gt;ag in Shuster, safe conduct of Wassmuss, and rising in Arabistan has been most equivocal, and even his staunch adherent, Dr. Young', wired, on -?7th Apiil that Sirdars present attitude excited his grave suspicion. Sheikh of Mohammerah reminds me Bakhtiaris are not a one great body nit a main -neaded monstei | that their interests are now no longer limited to Rikhtiari country, but that they have stretched their tentacles all over 1 ei-^ia, and though he thinks trom self-interest they will not enter seriously into war, he is not confident of their being ready to enter into any compact with him and us. As be lore stated, however, he is prepared in our joint interests to enter into mailimonial project il it proves likely to promote an agreement. In view ol Sirdar Jangs recent attitude it is possible he may seek to avoid open meeting with me or my representative; in that case 1 would propose to semi Haji Rais to represent me as well as Sheikh of Mohammerah. W e could hardly have a better emissiary for the purpose in view. Altei pointing out what Bakhtiaris stand to lose by joining in hostilities agaiu&gt;t us. and what they may gain by peaceful co-operation with Sheikh and us, we should state following requirements. Jhe^ must jrefuse to take up arms against us, and must do their utmost t &gt; discourage ji^ad generally, and vigorous suppression of it within their til a I teim )i\. 1 hey must maintain internal order and secure escort in sphen o( oil company, also on Ahwaz-Ispahan road and at Ispahan itself, where their representative must protect all subjects of Great Britain and ner Allies and must maintain security of road and telegraph lines up to Kars boundary, They must cope to a permanent friendly understanding with Sheikh of Mohaumierah add give him all necessary co-operation in Arabistan by refusing to harbour refugees from his territory and by maintaining peace on border. Fheir representative at Behbehan must likewise suppress fanaticism and maintain order there and refrain from all interference with Lirawi or with Sheikh if Mohammerah’s tribes in that vicinity. Any Bakhtiari being a Ppvuricial Gorenjor in Southern Persia at time of outbreak of war must do his best to prpteef British subjects and interests, suppress fanaticism and keep [ ■ Bakhtian] quiet and neutral. In return for this we should undertake on conclusion of war to preserve t&gt;akhtiari country with its present limits for liibe anrl give Khans local Autonomy to deal with their own tribesmen in ow i way undor our should agree to keep Bakhtiari Governor guidance and be prepared lo consider Bukhtiari-cambc ,o - other governorships in sphere controlhHi by u&gt;. We should be prepared a r °n to consider sympathetically any workable proposal thc\ might put for obtaining access to ports on Persian Gulf. ■&gt;?. ^.g| On receiving undertaking to the effect required bon, revognised repre sentatives of two families we would pay eficTTbrancii each now and 10,000L each at end of war if they carry out died part of tpc Un-gam. effectively.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000223_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/652</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000223</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/652</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 469/1917 Pt 1 'Persia: Bakhtiari affairs'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1915/1920</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-06-20T22:23:13</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (260 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 469 (Persia: Bakhtiari affairs) consists of two volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/652-653.
