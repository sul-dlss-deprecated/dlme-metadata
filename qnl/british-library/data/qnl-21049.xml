NO -S c v 5 IK' //a The Residency , Bus hire , 20th September 1/23 • Lighting and Buoying of the Persian G-ulf. Jhj &amp;&amp;&amp; In order to give effect to what they call -the 'recognised principle that services rendered to navigation should 'be self-supporting' the Government of India are considering the possibility of levying dues from all shipp ing traversing the Persian Gulf and benefiting by the lighting and 'buoying services at present freely given to navigation in those waters by His Majesty's Government and the Government of Ind ia. -2-, the purposes of general navigation there are at present in Persian Gulf wafcers three lighthouses , vis . on the juoin island , on Tamb islam and at Muscat • one lightship off the Coast of Kais island ; a light vessel and lighted buoy at the Shatt-el-iirab Bar ; and two light ed buoys at both Bushire and Bahrain. Government's pro posal is to treat all these lights as forming one group , and to charge a flat rate for the service as a whole which will , it is thought, most conveniently take the form of dues from all ships entering the Gulf. In calculating how much they are likely to coll ect in this way , the Government of India (who l^ave lately addressed the political Resident pti this subject; observe that the anticipated revenue is exclusive of possible receipts from sailing craft' ; and they have enquired as levying to the possibility of SwojsMr dues »an such otatt, the ports Maj or C . K. Da ly , political Agent , Bahrain .( ports at which the levy if feasible should be made, and the rates which should be charged . as the legal position and locus s tan di of His Majesty's Government and the Gov ernment of India are doubtful it is not possible at this stage to take the Arab rulers concerned into consultation. But the -Political Resident would be glad to have your opin ion whether the Shaikh of Bahrairywould consent to such a levy at what ports its imposition would be practicable , and what rate of fees would be suitable having regard to the cost of the service( which may be taken to be about four lacs a yeary and th e proportion of benefit derived from it by sailing craft. Colonel Knox, I am to say, does not think that there is the smallest chance that Arab rulers would agree to any such levy; but the Government of India consider it desirable that it should be introduced if possible . Another matter on which the Government of India desire information is the possibility of recovering d^ es for the use of port lights at Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait. Will you please consult the Shaikh of Bahrain^onfidentially as to this proposal , and if he is agitable , let Colonel Knox know what rates you would consider suitable 1 in con— 1 sultation wi'ttL the ruler.

Department memor~ andurn Ho. 40C~M dated 24th August 192^ (received 6th Sept ember 1923) on the above subject. As regards Port lights at (a) Muscat (b) Bahrain and (C) Kuwait. (a) The Lighthouse at Muscat has not yet functioned and in any case Dhows rarely if ev o r make Muscat harbour at night so no light dues c^n be expected from them. (b) The buoye at Bahrain mark the channel for steamers; other channels exist which are used by nearly all Dhows except the largest ocean going , and in any ca^e Dnows do not often attempt to make Bahrain at night. (c) The steamer light maintained as a leading light on the agency flagstaff is of more use to steamers than to KM&amp; Dhows . The Shaikh maintaina two lights which are of greater use to local navigation via. on his house at Ras Ajuzah ard on the island of Maskan to the north-west of Pailakan (mia- -spelt imshjan or Mesdjani on the maps). all sailing boats entering Kuwait are liable for fee of Ha 2/- harbour dues, known as 1 Sukkan 1 or rudder money out of which the Maskau iignt is maintained but not the light on the Shaikh 1 o house which His excellency maintains himself as he does not favour2 favour any increase in the jort dues . as regarde the cluestion of a general levy on native craft for light dues I have referred the matter to the Pol it -ical Agents on the ^rab aide and they all no Id ti* opinion, with which I concur, that the Arab rulers will never volunt arily agree to such a levy. It must £&gt;e remenibered that ^rab native craft, have plied in the 0ulf from tlrce immeinorial without lightfc or buoys* and that the owners and nakhudas of such craft have n*v«r evinced the slightest desire to have lights and buoys , and that as in point of fact aa they feel tjeir way along the Coast such lights and buoys are of very little use to them. Apart from this the question arises if the ^reb rulers consented to the levy of light dues and imposed them on Arab craft, what would happen in the caoe of Persian craft of which th&amp;re are very large numbers ? Tne Persian (lovernment would n^ver agree to the levy of dues from Persian craft for th® benefit of anybody but themselves, and it would be highly invidious if ^rab sailing craft had to pay light dues while Persian sailing craft did not. For the above reasons X deprecate raiding the question with the Arab rulers at all and suggest that the idea of levying light dues on native craft may be drppped. The delay in replying is due first to the absence of a Political Agent at Muscat when the memorandum under reply was received and secondly to the illness of that officer almost immediately after his arrival.

Port Lighting. / In further reference to my letter herein, of 15th March, (23rd Ramdhaan)last, I would report that I have had a further opportunity of discussing this question with navigating officers, and I would amend my letter as follows: A. The approach to the Port. A stone beacon having recently been erected on the Fesht al Djebal, if a permanent light were affixed upon this beacon, with a range of at least twentymiles, there would be no need to remove the present outer buoy light, as suggested. It will be remembered that the danger in navigating this port lies in the approach to the Outer Buoy, owing to the reefs and submerged rocks in that approach. After the Outer Buoy is found, all danger is past; and the purpose of a light on the Fesht al Djebal is to warn mariners of the situa tion of the Fesht, and to assist them in avoiding the Fesht and find^the Outer Buoy light. It is essential that the light should have a range of at least twenty miles, to te effective. Such a fixed light would eliminate the necessity for a bright anchored light, which is liable to the risk of^drifty B. The Lighting of the Port . In proceeding to anchorage, (after having passed the Outer Buoy) steamers proceed upon a course laid upon the Jebbal Lukkan and the Western Minaret of the Mosque of the Suq al Khamis. A reasonably bright light placed upon this western minaret, which is high, would render a light upon the Portuguese Fort unnecessary, and a steamer, after sunset, could proceed along its usual course to anchorage with safety, which at present it is unable to do. This light, with the Customs Light and the Maharaq light would meet the requirements of Uavigators desiring to make the port at night; and the three lights would form the 'triangle' which I recommend. In general, I would report that navigators regard this port in view of its importance, as the worst-lighted in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour'to be.
