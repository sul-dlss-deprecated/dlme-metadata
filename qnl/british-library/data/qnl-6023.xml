At the same time they asked for a ruling on the extent of Kuwait territorial waters. The question of concessions outside territorial waters obviously must be decided in the light of the more general decision on the continental shelf question, but it occurs to us that we shoiild now try to settle the more limited question raised, namely the extent of Kuwait's territorial waters. At the time this question was discussed by departments the Admiralty in their letter of the 12th June, 194C, L.05357/40 suggested a solution, but did not wish the questions raised by the Company to be f rther discussed curing the war period. The point at issue in the discussion of the extent of territorial waters was whether Kuwait Bay would be regarded as an historic bay; there were no awkward questions involving boundary disputes with other Etates. It should, therefore, be comparatively simple to settle this question and it must obviously first be settled before we can go on to discuss allocations of extra territorial waters to Kuwait. ^ I would be glad, therefore, if you would consider the possibility of resuscitating this particular question and obtaining a firm decision.

(2) As regards the question whether Kuwait Bay can be regarded as a territorial inlet (or 'Historic Bay'), the view of the Admiralty expressed in paragraph 4 of their letter of 12th June, 1940, was that such a claim would be unlikely to be challenged in an international court. I am not sure whether in the circumstances you and the Admiralty will consider it necessary, before definitely accepting this view of the status of Kuwait Bay on behalf of His ^ajesty's Government, for us to refer to the Political Aesident for evidence of the longstand ing exercise by Kuwait of jurisdiction over the waters of Kuwait Bay. If it is thought desirable for us to refer to the Political Resident, he will need some guidance as to the precise kind of evidence which it is desirable to obtain and we should like to know 7 what we are to say to him. V*e should be grateful for your views. If it is agreed t regard Kuwait Bay as a territorial inlet, then subject to the views of the Political Resident, we can see no objection to acceptin 0 the base line describee on paragraph 5 of the ^dmiralty letter of 12.th June 1940.

I am replying to your letter to Cls.rke of the 26th August last about status of the waters of Koweit Bay. Since the question was last discussed in 1940, the question of the exploitation of dll deposits situated outside territorial waters, but in close proximity to the coast, has been the subject of considerable discussion, and the tendency now is to regard it as relat ed rather to the ownership of the sea bed than to that of the waters above, which questions are governed in international law by widely different principles. It is possible therefore that the right to exploit oil in Koweit Bay may be determined independently of the status of the waters of the Bay, but this matter is still awaiting decision, and in the meantime it would be well to assemble - all available evidence in support of the view that Koweit Bay is a territorial inlet belonging to Koweit. The kind of evidence required is broadly indi ated in paragraph 4 of the Admiralty letter of the 12th June 1940, in which they say that the claim to regard Koweit Bay as a territorial inlet would rest not only on configuration but also on the grounds that territorial rights are necessary for defence and neutrality and that the Bay is secluded from normal traffic routes. The Admiralty seemed to assume that there would be no difficulty in establishing the territorial status of the Bay on these grounds. It would be very helpful nevertheless if concrete evidence of the long standing exercise of jurisdiction over the waters of the Bay could be”produced' in the shape of laws for the control of navigation over the whole,bay, within the limits indicated in tne Admiralty letter, such as laws and regulations regarding customs, lighting, buoying, harbour and other dues, fisheries, etc., especially if these''have been applied without protest to foreign vessels using the Bay.

There are various things the Sheikh of Koweit could do to affirm the national status of the bay, namely (1) enact a law saying that the bay is Koweit national v/aters, (2) to take more definite action, without enacting ary law, indicating that the Sheikh does claim the bay as his national waters e.g. by issuing notices or regulations indicating that certain provisions of existing laws, and so forth, which apply to Koweit territory apply to this bay, (3) to issue a regulation about fishing in Koweit Bay, reserving it, if that is what is always done, to Koweit nationals. Any law issued under (1) should make it clear that it is merely declaratory of the position as it always has been. The above list is not, ox course, exhaustive. One thing the Sheikh can do, without bringing the 'continental shelf 11 question into it, is to tell the concessionary company that his territory does extend to the mouth of the Bay# and give his definition of the bay. I am sending copies of this letter to Dodds at the Admiralty and Farrell at the Ministry of Fuel and Power. Yours &amp;o., S, P. Do *rdLdson, E sq. , C.M.G. , India Office. (Sd) R. Dunbar,KJL. CONFIDENTIAL. The Iblitical Agency,T- Kuwait. J).0, No.C/294. Dated the 13th April, 1947. Subject:- Status of Kuwait Bay y dear Colonel, Please refer to your printed letter No.516-3 dated the 28th March, 1947. 2. The second suggestion in Dunbar’s letter to Donaldson is not practicable as there are no suitable existing laws in Kuwait. The first suggestion could, in theory, be carried out but in practice it would be difficult as the Shaikh has never yet enacted a law of this nature. In fact there is really no established process in Kuwait for enacting laws : and a statement signed by the Shaikh and displayed to the public to the effect that Kuwait Bay was territorial waters would be quite unprecedented and would cause a great deal of comment. i 3. The third suggestion is more practicable, but, again, such a regulation would cause comment. Since the Shaikh has in the past successfully prevented non-Kuwaitis from fishing in the bey in spite of the fact that no regulations about it existed, where, it would be asked, is the necessity for suddenly producing a regulation now ? 4. There is, of course, no objection to the suggestion in the penultimate paragraph of Dunbar’s letter. 5. I am averse to making any suggestion to the Shaikh that he should depart from established custom in the issuing (or non-issuing) of laws and regulations, and I am sure that he himself would be most reluctant to do so. Any claim founded on such laws or regulations would be regarded (by neighbouring oriental countries at any rate) as obviously prompted and engineered by us. The Shaikh would if necessary be able to prove by oral evidence that he has denied to non-Kuwaitis on several occasions in the past the right to fish in Kuwait bay, and this would, in my opinion, be the only evidence worth producing in support of a claim based on configuration and other grounds Yours sincerely, The Hon’ble LT-Colonel, W.R.

Please refer to your deal official letter No. Ext.461/47, dated the 12th March, 1947. 2. I am not in favour of the first two suggestions in Dunbar's letter. There is no established process in Kuwait for enacting laws and if the Shaikh were to take the present opportunity for establishing such a practice ouch undesirable publicity and coausent would be likely to ensue, kith regard to the third suggestion alans or notices have been issued by Shaikhs in the past cf. Shaikh Mubarak's alans published as Kos. 3B and 3C in the collection of Treaties and Engagements in force between the British Government and the Bulers of Kuwait, 1841 • 1913. * ven so, 1 consider that for the Shaikh to publish such an alan in the present case out of the blue and not as a result of any specific Incident might again cause undesirable comment. If, however, it is considered essential that the shaikh should publish something In writing to establish Kuwait's claim to the bay this is the best course to recommend to him. 3. 1 see no objection to the proposal In the third paragraph of Dunbar's letter and I recommend that we should inform the Kuwait Oil Company in writing that his territory Includes the whole of the Bey up to its mouth which should be defined as in paragraph 8 of Admiralty letter No. M.06357, dated the 12th June, 194D, a copy of which was enclosed with Peel's demi official letter to Prior Mo.

A letter from the Shaikh to the Company would appear to fom better evidence than one from the Political • Agent to the Company. On the other hand, local relations between the Company and the Shaikh should, except in routine matters, be conducted through the Political Agent. The best course therefore would be for the Shaikh’s letter to be sent to the Company through the Political Agent. This will also enable you to check that the boundary of the Bay is correctly defined. if you see no objection please arrange for action to be taken accordingly. Copies of the correspondence should be sent to this office for trans mission to the India Office. 3. I agree with the India Office that the issue of alans in respect of the Bay would be a useful means of cons'ol i d at in g the position, and should be glad if you would impress on the shaikh the desirability of seizing the earliest suitable opportunity of issuing one. 7 Major M.P.

After some discussion it was agreed that it was necessary to decide now the principles on which His Majesty's Government consider that the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf should be divided, if it became necessary to resort to a division. The Gtate Department should then be consulted. The newt o fca^e would be to inform the rulers under our control and tneir neighbours Iraq and fcaudi Arabia, of our views. x hen f whenever it became necessary or desirable to make an actual division of the sea-bed between different states and rulers, we should endeavour to spply ad hoc the principles which we had formulated, in the case of the Arab shaitf-hdoms under our control we should warn the rulers that if they received applications for oil concessions in respect of the sea-bed outside their territorial! waters, it would be necessary for them, if they wished to grant concessions, to take steps by a formal d eclarat ion to acquire jurisdiction and control over the portions of the sea-bed which would fall to them under our proposals. it was agreed that the territorial waters of the states on the s.'7. shore of the Gulf should be considered as extending to a limit of three nautical miles from high-water mark. it was agreed that the principles to be applied should bo ‘Lore of 1 resident Truman’s Proclamation regarding the Continental oh elf. As regards the north east/south west division of tne sea-bed a median line should be drawn between the Horth-Eastern and south-Western shores of the Gulf. Home difficulty would be experienced in drawing the median line at the extreme northern end of the Gulf owing to Persian claims m respect of the mouth of the ^hatt-el-Arab. Consideration was given to the possibility that it might oe advisable at the outset to limit claims on the Arab side ax ihx to a limit within the median line, for example a ten or twenty fathom line. it was however agreed that this suggestion was open to many objections and it was decided not to proceed with it. As regards the transversal division of the sea-bed on the Gouth-western side of the median line the aim might he to extend the iPand frontiers from the coast to meet the median line. This would certainly involve practical difficulties since there are disputes about some of these frontiers and even where the frontier is not disputed there is doubt as to the angle at which the frontier intersects the coast line, it was noted that the interest of the oil companies was likely to be concentrated in the first place on the sea-bed between the mouth of the ?&gt;hu11-el-Arab and Bahrain and that this would involve not only the portions of the sea-bed affected by one disputed land frontier, i.e. that between Iraq and Kuwait, but also that attributable to the Kuwait .Neutral none territory. it was agreed that if a general application of the above principles of equitable d ivision co uld be agreed on, it would be useful in settling disputes between the various rulersx* involved on the Arab side of the dull'. The recent decision on the division of the waters between Bahrain and Qatar was an example of the application of these principles, it was agreed that before taking any action with the Americans it was desirable to take legal opinion on the Interpretat ion of provisions of existing concessions in respect of rights over the sea-bed of territorial and extra-territorial waters, which the territorial Sovereigns might be held to have already conceded thereunder. The Ministry of i?‘uel and Power representations undertook to draw up a memorandum, for consideration by their hegal Advisers and the foreign office Legal Advisers. It was also agreed that the Ministry of fuel and Power would send an interim reply to the Bhell Company’s enquiry and would explain to them orally the lines on which we were thinking of proceeding.CChTIDEKTlAL N*.2271-S (U6) The H©n ! ble the Pelitical Resiaent, Persian Gulf, Bahrain presents his compliments t©:- The Political Agent, KUWAIT The Political Agent, and has the honour to transmit to them the under- mentioned document(s) for inf^rmatipn.,,.^, ^ , Vt/,hi PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BABB.AIN f ! No d the 30th December 1947 REFERENCE TO nREVIGUS CORRESPONDENCE Description cf Encl©sure N ame and Date Subject Commonwealth Relations Office endorsement N©.nxt.2715/47 dated the , 23rd December, 1947, 11 H DIVISION OF PETROL- l EUM RIGHTS UNDER N PERSIAN •LB'cone under the control of Iraq, Kuwait, the Kuwait-Saudi-Arabia Neutral .one, Sandi-Arabla, Bahrein, uatar, and the Trucial States. In each of these petroleum rights are already held under concession contracts by oil companies, the sole exception being the Kuwait share of the Neutral Zone, for which several companies are now bidding. I am, however, not in a position to advise you as to how these contracts may affect tenitcrial or extra-territorial waters. As reg rds the Sheikhdoms (as distinct from the Kingdoms of S&amp;udi-Arabia and Iraq), which are under an obligation not to grant any oil concessions in their territories without the agreem fit of H.M.G., it is thought that it would be advantageous to the companies to make any approach with the co-operation of the local British political authorities. Ve would, however, prefer that any such approach should wait until we have concrete proposals to make to the rulers on the subject of the ownership of submarine petroleum rights. In the case of the Trucial States the situ tion is particularly fluid; thire are 6 States involved, none of which have as yet any defined bound ries, and it is doubtful whether it would be worthwhile (even if practicable to allot in any map separate strips of the sea-bed to individual states. In any case, it would oeem unlikely that any advantage would oe gained by being the first to make an approach to the rulers as they would certainly consider all offers on a competitive basis. In the case of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, which differ from the others in not being under our protection, it is for the company to decide If and when they desire to approach the ruler, but we would like advance notice of any such intention. Finally, we must point out th t the Treasury will undoubtedly scrutinize in considerable detail applications for authority to do more than make preliminary soundings, particularly in the light of the present outlook for steel supplies and as regards any payments or oblig tions to pay in the equivalent of gold. They will also have to be satisfied that there is no legal doubt as to the right of the particular ruler to the areas in question.CONFIDENTIAL memorandum No. 1548-S dated 26th August, 1947 regarding the flying of local national flags by merchant vessels visiting the Gulf Shaikhdoms. 2. The matter has been further considered in consultation with His Majesty's Government. -The position seems to be that a ship always flies (e.g. at its stern) the flag of the State where it is registered or that of the State of which its crew are nation als and may sometimes also fly the flag of the State of which the Charterers are nationals. As an act of courtesy a ship may in addition fly at the foremast the flag of the country of destinat ion when coming into one of the latter's ports or anchorages. This it is understood is often done as a gesture of courtesy to the local sovereign or Ruler. \ 3. So far as the Gulf Shaikhdoms are concerned His Majesty's Government feel that there should be no objection to the local flags being flown at -the forem^ast of incoming ships as an act of courtesy but it would be better for this to be done only when ships are approaching and entering ports or anchorages and not in territ- crial waters as such. There is no objection to your informing the Shaikh of Kuwait at your discretion as well as Gray, Mackenzie and'any other shipping companies of His Majesty's Government's views as outlined above. 7 V. jor M.P.
