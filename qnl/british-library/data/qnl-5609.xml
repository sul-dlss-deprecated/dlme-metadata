Gastrell, Esq., British Consulate General, Bushire, Persian Gulf.D.O. 8 9 c/o Lloyds Bank Ltd., 6 * Pall Iviall) S^W.l. 19th August, 1934. My dear Burchall, Reference Fletcher’s letter of 7th June to the Bushire Residency, a copy of which has been forwarded to me on leave, with regard to your Station Superintendent, Shargah, - Janes - having his wife to stay with him. As you will see from the previous correspondence I did not think it advisable to give permission for a lady to live at Shargah, but said that I would give a final decision before the Autumn. 2, I have now once again carefully considered the question, and am afraid that my decision must be in the negative. Since the Air Port was opened at Shargah things have gone very smoothly there - far more so than I had anticipated, and I am very loath to do anything which would in any way increase (a) the risks of any incident occurring, or (b) augment the complications when any incident had occurred. 3 . With regard to (b). If at any time there was serious trouble at Shargah the fact that a woman was in residence, who might for instance have to be evacuated, would undoubtedly augment the difficulties of the situation. With regard to (a). I cannot guarantee that some unpleasant incident would not arise in regard to Mrs. Janes, such as her being insulted by some uncouth Bedouin from the interior or by an impertinent townsman. Any incident of this kind would involve retributory action of some kind, and consequent bad relations with the/2 the Shaikh and so forth, I do not think either of these contingencies likely, especially (b), but one has to take them into consideration, 4. It is true that women passengers in the Company’s liners pass through Shargah, but normally they arrive late one evening and depart the next morning, and passengers do not - or should not - enter the town, (On this point some time ago I addressed the Sheikh, and also wrote to the Company). Anyhow should there be any risks attendant on women passengers passing through Shargah they are unavoidable if there is to be an air service at all on the Arab Coast. This argument does not of course apply to Mrs. Janes going to Shargah, and the fact that she would live there permanently alters the problem considerably. 5. You will appreciate the fact that the responsibility for allowing Mrs. Janes to go to Shargah would be entirely mine. It certainly would not be that of the Company, and though the Sheikh has - to the best of my recollection - stated to Janes that he has no objection to Mrs. Janes living at Shargah, this would help very little in the event of an incident. 6 . I quite appreciate the desire of the Company to make your Shargah representative happier, and as a married man myself I think it distinctly hard that Janes should be separated for long periods from his wife. The remedy, however, appears to be in the Company* s hands. They can either send a bachelor to Shargah, or - for married men - make it as a short service post. I am sending this, together with a copy of Fletcher’s letter, to you through Laithwaite at the India Office, and am asking him if he will be so kind as to send copies to Bushire and the Government of India, and keep copies for himself.

The threatened arrival of Mrs.Howard-Clitty has created no little concern to the Rulers and the Political Agents of Bahrain and Kuwait. At the former place Mrs.Howard-Clitty proposes to stay with Mr.Yusuf Kanoo, whom she had met casually for a few hours when she travelled in the Gulf some years ago. Mr. Yusuf Kanoo by no means relished the prospect, and of course it was most undesirable that a European lady - Mrs.Howard-Clitty is apparently an American subject - should stay with an Arab, though Mr.Yusuf Kanoo himself is a most respectable citizen and a recipient of the C.I.E. 3. At Kuwait Mrs.Howard-Clitty proposes to stay with one Kohamed Yatim, Major Holmes’ Agent, who has an unenviable reputation in the Gulf of being a notorious drunhard and evil liver, and in Kuwait actually resides in the prostitutes’ quarter. 4. Mrs.Howard-Clitty, who now apparently proposes visiting Kuwait first, has been informed by the Political Agent, Kuwait♦ © 17, M 2 . Kuwait, with my full approval, that if she visits there, she must arrange with the American Mission to take her in, or reside there in circumstances which he - the Political Agent - approves of. 5.

Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th March, bringing to notice one or two incidents that have occurred on the shores of the Persian Gulf in which personnel or passengers of my Company have been involved. I note that the slight accidental injury to a local inhabitant through one of our staff shooting at Gwadar was satisfactorily settled at the time, and the steps you wouLi wish us to take to avoid the possibility of any such furtner incident. T am, therefore, issuing the necessary instructions to our employees in the Gulf and I have pleasure in enclosing herewith a copy of them. I very much regret to hear that our passengers have been visiting Shargah and that one woman passenger did so clad in beach pyjamas. We have already given specific instructions that neither our staff nor our passengers are to leave the precincts of the fort, but the instructions appear to have been disobeyed. I am 5.n consequence emphasising the importance of insisting upon the passengers remaining at the fort and not going into the town and of our own staff exercising the utmost discretion in dealing with the local people. I gather from weekly reports that we receive from our Station Superintendent at Shargah that his relationship with the Shaikh is very cordial and indeed the people at Shargah seem to have accepted the Company and its aircraft, staff and passengers in a much more amiable way than might have been expected.

The correspondence speals for itself. It is obviously quite undesirable that European ladies should wander about Shargah in beach pyjamas and it is to be hoped that the Residents letter to the Sheikh of 30 th March and his representations to Imperial Airways will secure that passengers shall not be allowed to enter the town. This is incidentally desirable from quite another point of view, for it will help us to keep a check on the activities of concession hunters, etc. We have just heard that the Iraq Petroleum Company have applied for visas for the Trucial Coast for a representative and, while these have been refused, communication between passing passengers and the Sheikh such as appears to have been taking place since the opening of the air station would obviously make it much more difficult for us to exercise the control which we desire*CONFIDENTIAL; No. 725. p. z 71 ?515 1933 Zi /w % ..

The papers record that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle) intervened with both Imperial Airways and Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar [Sultan bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī], Ruler of Sharjah to ensure that passengers, especially women, were prevented from entering Sharjah without permission. British officials felt that European women in particular were at risk of being insulted or molested by members of the local population, with attendant political consequences for relations with the ruler.Folios 13-18 concern the proposed temporary residence of a British woman, Mrs Winifred J Howard-Clitty in Bahrain and Kuwait. The papers record that the Political Resident asked British Government officials to ensure that in future he should be consulted first before visas were issued to women travellers to the Gulf, particularly if they intended to reside in any of the Arab shaikhdoms. The Foreign Office and the Passport Office agreed to the proposal.Folios 2-12 concern a request from Imperial Airways that the Station Superintendent at Sharjah be allowed to have his wife live with him in Sharjah during the winter. The Political Resident vetoed the request because of similar concerns to those previously expressed in folios 19-32, and to avoid setting a precedent for such action in other parts of the Gulf that were as yet considered unsuitable for European women to live in.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
