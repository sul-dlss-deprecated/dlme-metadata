Long, rather narrow triangular blade of bronze with straight sides, which sets the piece apart from its type, slightly blunted tip and on either face a flat, low but pronounced rather broad midrib, narrowing to tip and running down into it. Bronze handle, oblong, with indented sides and deeply indented ends, the horn of one of which enclose the shoulders of the blade, while the horns of the other overlap the opposing horns of the pommel, which is of ivory, crescent-shaped, with a median tongue meeting a tongue from the handle, so that on either side an oval hole is left, for passing through a thong. The handle is covered on both faces alike with three thin strips of ebony laid on longitudinal shallow grooves and fastened with large nails, their heads underlaid with small leather \u201cGoodyear\u201d rosettes: two on either side, four on the long median board. The handle is fastened to the blade with three smaller nails, forming an equilateral triangle, on either face. Excellent example of well-known type.\r\nCondition: Good. Edges of blade jagged.

In the Middle Kingdom, toolsmiths developed a more effective weapon that had a long blade with convex sides narrowing to a curved edge. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost daggers, which resembled short swords, had double-edged blades riveted to ivory or bone handles and reinforced by a vertical rib. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bow and arrow remained an Egyptian&rsquo;s most effective weapon. (Unfortunately, the Brooklyn Museum does not have a complete example.) Archers shot from a stationary position or from the cab of a moving chariot as a skilled driver spurred on the horses.
