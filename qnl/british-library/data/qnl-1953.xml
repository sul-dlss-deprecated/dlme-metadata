The ' spirited' active policy adopted by the British Government in the maintenance of their interests in the Persian Gulf during the first five years of Lord Curzon's administration has perhaps recently undergone a change to that of passive vigilance, as appears from the following telegram (dated 28th February 1905) of the Secretary of State to the Viceroy in connection with the proposed agreement with the Chief of Katar (Secret E., March 1905, Nos. 795.800):— ' At the present time when a general sense of insecurity and suspicion prevails in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, His Majesty's Government are unwilling to raise any question touching the status quo in this quarter. They propose to refer for examination by the Defence Committee the whole question of our policy on this region.' 29th January 1906. [C645FD] J. A. SALDANHA.LIST OF CONTENTS. CHAPTER I.

I should be glad, therefore, to know whether Her Majesty's Government would have any objection to concession being granted to a Russian, provided a large proportion of the capital were English. From a commercial point of view, the proposed railway would be advantageous to England, and would greatly help in the development of Persia. No. 3. Telegram P., No. 30, dated the 25th April 1893. From —Marquis op Salisbury, London, To— Sir F. Lascellss, Tehran. I have received your telegram No. 59 of the 18th instant in regard to a proposal to construct a railway from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. If British capital and British management had a leading share, I should not, in princi ple, have any objection to a bond fide undertaking of the kind. I should wish to be assured that this would be the case before I express an opinion on any individual proposal, and I should like also to be certain that the British capital would be subscribed, as otherwise the concession might prove to be nothing else than a lever for political intrigue, or the railwav after being constructed from the Caspian as far as Tehran, might take a direction which would be injurious to British interests, or might never get beyond the capital, 10.

Dr Marc in 1807 occupied himself visiting Bandar Abbas, from whence he was in the habit O' despatching official reports to his Government, and where he maenani- mously treated all patients free of charge. His medical pursuits at this place were assisted by a third Russian, named Adamoff, who appears to have been an artillery officer, and subsequently visited Bushire and Basrah. In 1898 two other Russian doctors, named Rodzewitz and Kornajevski, appeared upon the scene and visited Basra Bush.re and Bandar Abbas. In December 1808 a fifth Rus sian doctor, named Poschkowski, arrived in the Gulf, and did not fail to pay the- 'IX) | regulation visit to Bandar Abbas; while he displayed a considerable professional activity during the outbreak of plague at Bushire, where he announced that, upon his approaching return to Russia, he was to be replaced by two com patriots. In connection with this medical propaganda, it has to be mentioned that when the first rumours were circulated of plague at Bushire, the Russian Lagation at Tehran at once announced their intention of sending doctors, with Cossack escorts, to Bushire as well as Shiraz, in order to establish a plague cordon for the protection of those places from the Indian pestilences and then Russian doctors took up their quarters both at Shiraz and Kerman. 13.

It was re- uyi 99, 03. 3 5 3 7- ported, however, that though the Russian Embassy at Constantinople supported the scheme, the Russian Ambassador did not actively interest himself in the affair. It was believed that M. Witte preferred a railway from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf instead of one from Tripoli, which would be impossible to carry out without English capital. 14. From reports received in April 1899, it was found that Count Kapnist c . r- c . ^ o xt « had informed the Porte that he had ceased becret e., September 1899, Nos. i8-i9. , • • i . t i to have any connection with the scheme, and that M. Rechnitzir was the real applicant for the concession. The terms of the draft convention were carefully examined at the Ministry of Public Works and certain modifications were agreed to. The head of the line was to be Alexandretta, not Tripoli, as originally proposed. The line was to proceed to Aleppo, Deir, Baghdad, Basrah and a terminus on the Persian Gulf, with a branch line from Baghdad to Najaf via Kerbella. A line from Koniah via Adana has to join the main line between Aleppo and Alexandretta. 15. In February and March 1899 three Russians proceeded to Koweit Russians visit Knweit, i S q O. from Basrah, furnished with letters of Secret E., September 1899, Nos. 140-180. introduction from the Wali. 16.

A merchant arrived at Bushire about this time and informed the Resident that three Russians had come to Bandar Abbas and that there were rumours that the place was to be leased to Russia. The visitors were not however Russians but a German by name Toeppen, a convert to Mohamedanism and his companions. 17. Prince Dabija proceeded Ahwaz by way of Mohammerah. The Russian Prince talked to the Sheikh of Mohammerah N0 ' 1 of his and Sheikh Mubarak being under British control, of the Russian desire to have a port in the Persian Gulf, and of the British being in the way, etc. 18.

Commercial intercourse between Russian firms and the south of Persia was also to be strongly encouraged by the Russian Government. Reuter recently telegraphed that the first vessel of the new Russian line of steamers was to have left Odessa on the 14th February to trade in the Persian Gulf. 27. M.

The vessel arrived at Maskat on the 7th March. Movements of the Belgian vessel 'Selika' {at On the following day, JVT. Ottavi, the present the Persian' Muzaffan,' 1901).

Ottavi said that the leader was a French Government official who was sent on Natural History Research. They asked for permission to call at Sohar, from whence the ship intended to proceed to the various Pirate Coast ports. Colonel Kemball tele graphed on the 2nd April that he had good grounds for believing that the Selika had come to the Persian Gulf to prospect pearl fishery ground. She arrived at Bahrein on the i ith April 1901, and next day a party from the vessel called On the Sheikh. They made enquiries after the trade of the place and secured samples of cloth, sugar and glassware. Lieutenant Asterrieth, one of the party, asked the Sheikh whether Belgian subjects would be prohibited from trading in Bahrein. On being informed that there was no restriction, he asked the Chief for a written undertaking which was refused. The Selika left on the 20th April and arrived at Bushire on the 23rd April. She left on the 25th April for Maskat via Lingah and Abu Thabi. 29. His Britannic Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at St. Petersburgh reported Russian Commercial Expedition to Persia. December 1900 that a Russian expedi tion had been organised to investigate certain commercial questions in Persia. The members of this expedition arrived in Tehran about January 1900. Count Olsonfieff travelled to Ispahan and after a short stay returned to Tehran. Two other gentlemen belonging to the Mission went together to Kermanshah. They also returned after a few days' visit. 30 The clerk in charge of the Indo-European Telegraph Office at Charbar , - „ . . „ , D . reported that two Russians, by name Movements of Russians m Eastern Persia, -.t. 1 , 0 , . , i n t • -i i f r IS'icolas blekcheevitch and Michael Haerms, accompanied by a Russian servant and a Persian, arrived at Charbar on 24th, that they had travelled from Bathkooba via Asterabad, Meshed, Seistan, Sara- wan, Dizak and Dashtyari, which they had been surveying, and that they left for Bampur via Geh on 28th March, taking plans and photographs of that country and natural history specimens.— {Extract from the t)iary of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the week ending the 8th April jgoi.) 31. Two Russians, MM. Leontieff and Ermtere, arrived at Maskat by the Visit of Russians to Maskat, S.S. Kurdistan on the 9th March Secret E., July 1901, Nos. 126-155. 1901. They came on shore directly the vessel anchored, and visited the French Consul. They subsequently interviewed the Sultan and asked for a written permit to start operations in the arms and ammunition business. The Sultan replied that there was no necessity for a written permit, as the import of arms was free to all. In taking leave of the Sultan, they said that they would return in a month's time. Captain Cox [W645FD]6 mentioned in a report, dated the 4th April, that a letter had been received at Maskat addressed to the ' Russian Vice-Consul at Maskat'. On the 15th June 1901, the Political Agent, Maskat, reported that^ repeated mention was made in French and Arabic newspapers of the intention of the Russian Government to appoint a Consular official to Maskat [see para. 45 below.] 32. Prince Dabija, the Russian Consul-General, visited Bushire on the 4th Visit of the Russian Consul-General at Ispahan to March I9OJ. He^ told Colonel Kemball Bushire. that his visit was in connection with the Secret^E., May 1901, Nos. 51-65. arrival, which was shortly expected, of the Russian merchant steamer. The Acting French Vice-Consul has, it has been said, been approached by Prince Dabija, with reference to the purchase of his house for the use of the Russian Consulate which was to be established at Bushire. 33. The Russian merchant steamer Korniloff, the first of the new Russian Commercial enterprise in the Persian Gulf&gt; Russian line Of Steamers to the Persian Secret e., May 1901, Nos. 51 -65. Gulf, arrived in Bushire on the 21st March 1901 from Odessa, having called at Maskat, Jask, Bandar Abbas and Lingah. At Maskat the Commander, accompanied by the French Consul, called on the Sultan. ^ She appears to have been heavily laden with cargo, as on first arrival at Bushire she was unable to enter the inner harbour until she had discharged 12,500 packages. This cargo, which was landed in Bushire, consisted of 7,500 cases of kerosene oil, and the remainder of sugar, cotton and silk piece-goods, crockery and other commodities. At Bandar Abbas she landed 600 bags of sugar. The cargo for Bushire did not appear to have been consigned to any particular merchants, but two Russians who came by the ship, and who were, it is understood, representatives of a Moscow firm, landed in Bushire and did their best to dispose of the goods. 34. There were about ten passengers in the Korniloff, consisting of Russians and Frenchmen and including Mr. Moesman, the Bushire representative of the firm of Messrs. Hotz and Son, a Dutch firm enjoying British protection which recently declared their intention of placing themselves under Russian protection. The latter came in the ship from Odessa and acted as agent for her in Bushire. The Captain of the Korniloff is, it is believed, a Russian Naval Officer, and the ship carries two small guns, from which a salute was fired when Prince Daibija paid a visit to the ship. She returned to Bushire on the 22nd April and left on the 22nd for Odessa via Lingah. She was said to have taken 250 tons of cargo from Basrah and 200 bales of cotton purchased by the Russian mer chants in Bushire, also 140 bags of tobacco belonging to Messrs, J. C. P.

M. Naus, the Director of Persian Customs, however, assured the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia that there was then no question of a fresh foreign loan. On the 29th July, a further report was received to the effect that an agree ment for a new Russian loan of over a million had been actually concluded, and that the Zil-es-Sultan had announced it as a fact. 41. Captain Schneider reported on the 2nd April 1901 that, while travel- R^sianraiiva, schemes in p „ s ia .Hng from Tehran to Europe, he met a Russian bngineer named Roskovsky who said that he had been sent by his Government to survey for a line of railway in Persia. From the photographs he shewed and from what he said. Captain Schneider gathered that the line was to run from Elizabepol in Russian territory to Julfa, Tabriz, thence to Tehran, Ispahan, Yezd and on to a port in the Persian Gulf. M. de Roskovsky declined to say anything as to the date or the time when the line was commenced. 42. In conversation with the British Consul-General at Ispahan, the Zil-es- Secret E, July 190., No. M . Sultan mentioned on the 13th April 1901 that some Russian Engineers had told him that they had a concession from the Sadr Azam to build railways in the south of Persia, and that one was for a line from Julfa to Tabriz through Hamadan to Ispahan, via Shiraz to Bandar Abbas or Bushire. 43. Mr. Swift, the English tutor to the sons of the Zil-es-Sultan, in a con versation with Sir A.

The Government of India submitted the point to the Secretary of State with the following observations (Despatch No. Ha-Secret—External, dated 8th August 1901) '8 u The circumstances connected with the appointment of a French Vice-Consul at » Vide letter from the India Office to the Maskat are known to His Majesty's Government.

But the present situation is hardly analogous. Russia has na treaty which binds Sultan to receive a Russian Consular representative ; and we have reason to believe that Kis Highness would far from welcome any such appointment. We therefore propose, with Your Lordship's permission, to cause the Sultan to be advised, if His Highness consults Captain Cox in the matter, that he should politely decline either to receive or to recognise a Russian Consul, cn the ground that Russian trade with Maskat does not justify such an appointment. The value of Russian imports to Maskat for the year 1900-01, as Your Lordship will see from the latest Administration Report of the Persian Gulf Political Residency and Maskat Political Agency, amounted to $ 10,000 only.'

He, however, found that the prices were too high, and consequently was only able to invest a little over Rs. 3,000 in pearls, and went away much disappointed with no intention of trying a similar venture again. He also said that the owners of the Selika had given up the idea of doing business in the Persian Gulf diary for week ending nth Gulf. He had also visited Maskat in November .90.. _ October 1901, and was inquisitive with regard to Gulf politics. 50.

The Sigrid was not apparently in receipt of the same concessions from the Russian Government as the Korniloff, but it was stated that her Suez Canal dues were paid by the Government, and that there was some arrangement that the Company should not be losers, if the trip turned out to be a failure financially. 52. The Korniloff again visited ^Maskat and the Gulf in the spring of 1902. She arrived at Maskat on the 23rd February 1902, and left the same day.

Her cargo for Bushire consisted of kerosene oil, flour, piece-goods and glassware ; she also brough to Bushire the flag staff for the Russian Consulate. She then left for Basrah. 53. Another Russian merchant steamer, the Trouver, visited the Gulf latter in the year.

The Varyag left Bushire on the 21st Decem ber, after her captain had exchanged visits with the local Persian officials and the foreign Consuls. She also visited Koweit, Bandar Abbas and Lingah, and then left the Gulf for the Far East. 55. It may be mentioned in connection with the Russian cruiser's move ments that the French cruiser Cat in at visited Maskat on the 24th January 1902, and her Commander, with his staff and the French Consul, called on the Sultan who returned the visit. She left Maskat on the 7th February, and arrived at Bandar Abbas on the 8th, and while there, her officers visited Hormuz Persian Gulf diaries for .he weeks ending and took photographs of the fort and 10th, 17th and 24th February, 3rd, 17th and vicinity.

He made careful enquiries regarding the doings of the English in Kerman, and visited the principal Visit to Kerman of the Russian Consul m Seis- merchants and shops. It is believed that Secret f., January 1902, Nos. 238-262. M. Miller's journey to Kerman had for its object the placing of a Russian Consul at that centre.

An annual subsidy of 200,000 roubles was promised to the Company for ten years in consideration of four sailings in the year. In 1903 the Company pro posed to utilize the Korniioff and Jrowver for the four sailings from Odessa. 76. The Russian Ministry of Finance took several other measures, for encouraging the exchange of merchandise by sea between Russia and Persia ; invited Russian manufacturers and merchants to send their agents to the Gulf, etc. The Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company decided also to hold permanent exhibitions of Russian industries. 77. According to a telegram that appeared In the Novoe Vremya of the 34th „ . „ October 1903, the above named Company ecret pn 1904, o. 23 . decided to establish an independent regular service from Odessa to the Persian Gulf and that special steamers were to be acquired by the Company for the purpose. 78. With a view to encourage this company, it appears that the Russian Gov- _ L „ , , _. ernment allows certain classes of English Secret E., July 1905, Nos. 394-395. , . 1 1 « ,• • 1 1 1 goods, notably Indian teas, carried by the Company's vessels from the Gulf to Batoum in the Black Sea, to be carried across the Caucasus free of transit duties to Baku and thence by the Caspian Sea to Persia. This would have also the effect of competing with the caravan routes in Southern Persia. 79. In h is letter No. 44, dated 30th January 1905, Major Grey reported p . . , . , # ,« n • ^ , that Sayyid Mahomed bin Said, son of Repotted intention of the Russian Government . o 1 &gt; 1 \\y • 1 1 r 1 • to place an agent in charge of the customs tnG oUltcin S lclt0 VVclZir, DrOUgnt lOF ulS P erusal a letter received from a Persian known as Sadid-us-Sultaneh, the Agent at Lingah, stating that the Russian Government intended to place an agent of their own in charge of the Customs at Gwadur and asked for information regarding the following points :— {a) The name of the present farmer and the price paid by him to the Sultan. {b) The total yearly receipts. (c) Differential treatment (if any). (d) Other particulars. 80. Under instructions from Major Grey, in order to avoid raising suspicion in the mind of the Russian Agent, Sayyid Mahomed replied giving the necessary information and further development was awaited. 80-A. In his letter No. 102, dated 21st February 1905, Major Grey reported that a reply was received from the Russian Agent expressing thanks for the information supplied, and stating that the representatives of the Russian Govern ment would move in the matter of the Gwadur Customs when they had com pleted their history of Maskat. Major Grey could form no idea of what was referred to. 80-B. When the Russian cruiser Gilyak arrived at Bandar Abbas on the 14th Russian coal at Bandar Abbas. February 1900, it was met there by a collier with 300 tons of coal. A portion of this coal her captain intended to leave at Bandar Abbas to be called for on her return journey. The Deputy Governor, however, refused to allow him to store the coal at the place, and the captain thereupon put on board as much as he could stow away and left Bandar Abbas, relinquishing two boatloads containing about 16 tons. The owners of the boats applied to the Deputy Governor, who ultimately consented to store this coal in a godown at the time belonging to a Persian sub ject now residing at Lingah.I) 13 The godown Is on the west side of the Court yard of the ' Kulla Feringhi' the upper floor of which is the official residence of the Deputy Governor, while the ground floor is used for offices and godowns by the Customs Department. Nearly all the neighbouring godowns are used by the Customs Department, and they were naturally anxious to get coal removed from the godown in which it is stored. It appears that all these godowns have been actually acquired by the Customs Department without any compensation, and the owner of the godown in question, who was formerly claiming rent for its use, has now ceased to take any interest in the matter. 81. During a visit, which the Russian Consul-General paid to Bandar Abbas in 1904, he is reported to have walked round and looked at the godown, but did not have it opened nor made any remarks on the subject. 82. Colonel Kemball was of opinion that we should not interfere in the Secret E„ November .so* No ..7, (N 0 * S'. dated the 26th February 1904). Lieutenant bhakespeare also depre cated any active steps being taken in the matter, as such would likely be to bring the question of ownership into prominence, and also revive any interest that the Secret e „ March .903. Nos. 566-567. ^ ussian Consular Agent might still take on the matter (No. 426 of 1904). 83.

To In Persia»5 induce them to call oftener, he tried to secure cargo by booking it at lower freight than that charged by the British India Agents (Messrs. Towell &amp; Co.), who in turn were obliged to reduce their rates. This competition was maintained for some time without^ any advan tage to the Bombay and Peisia Steam Navigation Company, which after a year s trial gave up sending their steamers so often to Muscat M. Chapui ultimately lost the Agency some time in 1886, having failed to remit the freight collected to the extent of fi, 800, which at the time he was supposed to have misappropriated. M. Chapui's opposition to the British India Agents annoyed Mr. Maquire, the proprietor of the firm of. Messrs. Towell &amp; Co. and Consular Agent for trance, and through his influence the Sultan gave notice to M. Chapui to vacate the Custom House. When the notice was served M. Chapui claimed R 1,600 as compensation for repairs but the matter was • ••••• compromised for S 800. This was early in 1884 and after that M. Chapui engaged another house. To revenge himself he began intriguing with the French Consul at Bombay, and supplanted Mr. Maquire as French Consular Agent in 1885, though he did not exercise the functions nor hoist the French flag as he was not permanently located in Muscat. The Consular seals which he received from Mr. Maquire were entrusted to his clerk and ulti mately returned to Bombay in 1886, when M. Chapui himself, after a stay of six years in the Gulf, returned to France. In 1884 a French line of steamers subsidised by the French Government began to run direct between England and the Gulf; M. Chapui gave out that he was the promoter of the undertaking, and the establishment of the line was attributed in the press to the efforts of an enterprising Frenchmen to push French trade in the Gulf. Having spent the funds with which he came out to Muscat M. Chapui was greatly hampered. He did not do any appreciable business either in Bunder Abbas or Muscat, but occasionally managed to ship on a small scale sulphur and ochre from Hormuz and dates, from Muscat, though, as he possessed no credit, he had great difficulty in obtaining funds. To do so he mortgaged the bills of lading with the French Bank in Bombay and then drew against it by drafts which he sold at a heavy discount. He was never for more than two months together either at Bunder Abbas or Muscat, and kept on travelling from one place to the other with the ostensible object of attending to business. To persons who were acquainted with the state of his affairs in the Gulf, and who asked him why he was constantly travelling with no settled purpose, he at one time alleged domestic troubles, and at others insinuated that he was a Russian spy. There is no doubt that during his stay in the Gulf he used to supply information to his Government regarding the commerce of Oman and the Gulf, and several other subjects, but it was not known whether he was paid for it or not. His correspondence was extensive and he received several letters by every mail. M. Chapui returned to France at the end of 1886 and returned to Muscat at the begin ning of 1887. On his arrival he opened a liquor shop at Jask : he had once before tried this in Muscat but had failed. In the present attempt he wished partly to give employment to his clerk, and partly to compete with Messrs. Durate &amp; Co. at Jask against one of the members of which firm, employed by Messrs. Towell &amp; Co. at Muscat, he had a grudge. Accordingly M. Chapui's clerk took with him some cases of wine and liquor worth about K 500 to &amp; Jask. The house selected for the shop was within the telegraph limits ; and when the cases were landed they were attached for want of a license until eventually the Director permitted the opening of the shop, which however was closed four months later. M. Chapui was suspected of having aroused the fears of the Persian Government about the importance of the Telegraph colony at Jask, and took to himself the credit of having ousted the telegraph guard there when it was withdrawn in 1887. As he had found employment for his clerk at Jask he finally left Muscat and went to Bandar Abbas in the middle of 1887. On his return from France he had brought samples of merchandise of every d escription, and now began to import goods on orders. But his chief object was to export salt, and accordingly he came to an arrangement with the chief of Kishm : he also entered into partnership with some merchants in Calcutta who sent a charter ed steamer from there to take away the salt; but just before the arrival of the steamer the greater portion of the amount collected was washed away by the rain, and out of 3,000 tons only 800 were save i. M. Chapui did all he could to get the steamer full cargo, but failed for want of funds. The Chief of Kishm who had a large quantity of salt declined to part with it except for ready money, so finally the steamer returned to Calcutta with only 800 tons. This took place in February 1888, and M. Chapui was now in great difficulties. Apart from the loss he had sustained both by the destruction of the salt and the expense of the charter, he had a debt of about R 800 to pay in the Bunder Abbas. His creditors began to dun him and at last he has to sell his furniture and a greater portion of his personal property to satisfy some of them. He then went to Karachi and Bombay, and returned with money to B mdar Abbas to pay the rest. /i6 His losses in Bunder Abbas compelled him to give up trading for the time, and he joined the Persian Government Gunboat Persepolis as second officer some time in May 1888. He served in her until the middle of 1889, when he was dismissed on account of his bad behaviour and insubordination. He then proceeded to Basrah and took the command of the river steamer plying between Mohammerah and Ahwaz ; but after being six monrhs in command he was dismissed from the Iran also on account of his ill-treatment of the passengers and crew. Early in 1890 he returned to Bushire, and after a stay of five months proceeded a second time to France. About seven months ago he returned to Bunder Abbas accompanied by M. Pierrepont, who, he said, was his partner in business and pearl fishing, but after some time they quarrelled and separated, M. Pierrepont then came to Bushire : at the request of the French Consulate he was given letters to the Agents at Bahrein and Shargah, where he said he was going to buy mother-of-pearl, requesting them to offer their good offices in case of need. In their visits to the Arab Coast they spoke disparagingly of each other. M. Pierrepont fell ill with fever and returned to France in August last. M. Chapui has now settled in Bunder Abbas : he has an interpreter, a Christian from Baghdad, and a Portuguese clerk, to each of whom he pays R. 120 per mensem besides their messing. He gets cash from Bombay by every mail as he cannot obtain in locally. His expenses exceed his profits, and as he had no money before his last visit to France, it is supposed that he is being backed up in his present doings. He receives illustrated newspapers which he distributes amongst the people and sends news of these parts to his country. He is about 53 years of age, of an average stature and very active ; but drinks very hard. Telegram, dated the 15th October 1891. From—Foreign Secretary, Simla, To—Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Demi-official. Your demi-official letter of 24th September, Trucial Chiefs. Please submit your proposals officially with form of agreement you would propose to conclude. 93. During his visits to Umm-ul-Kowein, M. Chapuy gave some valu able presents to the Chief and became very intimate with him. The Chief seems to have been deeply impressed with the power of France, inability of the British to interfere with dhows carrying French colours, and practical impunity with winch the Sur boats, about 30 in number, carried slaves under the protection of the French flag. He seems to have welcomed with gratification proposals— evidently made by the French visitors—for a return to s/ato ante quo, when his subjects carried on slave trade with so much profit, but which had been put a stop by the British. He went so far as to undertake to write a letter to the French Government through the two Frenchmen, stating that any one coming to his country from the French Republic would be gladly welcomed. ^ • f 4 ' W ^ en Major Talbot, Officiating Resident, heard of these proceed, ings from the British Agent at Shargah, he directed him to invite the Chief's attenticin to the term 3 of his (the Chief's) letter of the 16th December 18^7 and the S'are Trade engagement of iStf. He afterwards obtained under orders j Government of India fresh agreements from, the Trucial Chiefs which provided that they would not entCT into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Government, that they would not assent to the residence withm their territory of an agent of any other Government and would not alienate any part of their territory save to the British Government 95.

A statement, they said, had been made by the French Vice-Consul, M. Bryois, to the effect that it was the intention of the French Government to establish a line of steamers and to open up French commerce with the Gulf leading to the Upper Karun. 100. In connection with this, Colonel Meade mentioned that the recent trip up the Karun by the French Vice-Consul had undoubtedly undertaken with the object of promoting French trade in the Province of Arabistan and on the Karun. 101. The French Vice-Consulate at Bushire was re-established in 1897 (vt'de French vice-Consulate at Bushire. para. 91 above.) M. Ferrand, who had been Page 6 of the Administration Report of the appointed Vice-Consul, arrived in June Persian G*w for 1897-98. *897. He remained till the end of October 1897. He was succeeded by M.

The French flag which he hoisted on shore was pulled down by order of the Persian Admiral, but was re-hoisted a few days later under a salute from the Persian battery. 103. In September 1898, the Zil-es-Sultan informed the British Legation French designs on Arabistan, that he had good evidence that the visit Nos. s8 and 28 A. of Secret e., December 1898, ^ Comte D Arlot, French Charge Nos. 12-29. d'Affaires, to Ispahan was not one for pleasure or travel, but was a political one. The French intended to get conces sions from the Persian Government in and about the districts of Mohammerah, Shuster and Dizful, in order that they might have a footing there. The French were supposed to be working for the benefit of the Russians. 104. In November 1898, Sir Mortimer Durand reported that a French French gcientific party under M. deMorgan in Scientific party Under the charge of M.

He opened with the Chief's permission two tombs at Ali, but was refused leave to remove inscriptions from the ruined mosque two miles out of Manama, which he was anxious to carry away. 109, Another Frenchman we find busy in the Gulf in 1903 was Mons. Jouanin, connected with the Depeche Coloniale and General Secretary of an influential French Society of Commerce run by the Colonial Party and issuing a periodical le Bulleim du Comte de CAsie Francaise, whose Gulf correspondent is M. Goguyer. M. Jouanin proceeded to Maskat and ports in the Gulf with samples of French goods and examined markets for openings. He visited Bahrein in September 1903 and approached the Chief with a project for opening a Bank at Bahrein, but was told by the Chief (who consulted Mr. Gaskin) that no need was felt for a Bank at the place.

His Highness alluded in this connection to the important part recently played by the United States in maintaining the independence of China, and indicated a hope that the creation and development of American commercial interests in Persia might similarly lead the American Government to watch with, greater attention the political future of this country.

The Residency was first established at Bushire probably for political reasons, and because it was not then safe to establish it on the opposite Arab shore, which was, more over, reputed of deadly climate, 6. That Bushire was not geographically considered by any means the most convenient point for effecting the objects which its establishment had in view, is shown from a glance at the map; for it is plain that, as the series of buccaneers to be overawed were settled along the lower western coast line of the Gulf between Khuteef, Bahrein, and Cape Mns- sundoom, any point along that shore would have had advantages over Bushire, provided the climate and political status had admitted of such an establishment* 7. That Bushire was not a well-selected point, viewed from a naval point of view, is implied in the fact that the squadron had to find a Head Quarter Station elsewhere, apart from the Political Resident. Bassadore, on the unhealthy Island of Kishin, was selected, and has since remained the Naval Head Quarters, although we have, I believe, no title to it other than the verbal permission of the Imaum of Muscat, who, by a Treaty subsequently entered into with Persia in 1856, has resigned his own pretensions to sovereignty over Kishin, and consented to farm it from the Shah for a term of years ; and to hold this farm under certain Treaty conditions, which may any day bring our occupation of Bassadore into question. Again, that Bushire roads are not convenient for shipping is equally obvious from the facts that the anchorage is confined, shallow, and exposed, as from the facts that communication with the shore by beat is slow, hazar dous, sometimes impracticable, for days together : the distance of the anchorage from the shore is nearly four miles. 8. That Bushire was not well selected for the prevention of the slave trade is shown from a glance at the map; the strategic point for throttling this trade, if by force it can be suppressed, being obviously the narrow Strait between Capes Jask and Mus- sundoom, at the entrance of the Gulf. One steam-vessel lying there, with her boats out as flanking parties, might visit every craft entering the Gulf more effectually than could a dozen such vessels cruizing in the Gulf after craft which having once entered it, would hug shallow dangerous shores, with slave ports always at hand. g. Viewed from a war point of view, a Station at Cape Mussundoom would, in res pect to the naval command of the Gulf, have possessed as many advantages over Bushire as does, in respect to the command of the Mediterranean, Gibraltar possess over an anchorage like that of Algiers of Tunis. 10. That the element of a telegraphic communication is now introduced, and that it would be convenient to have the main Station, or the one from which, in the contingency of breakage in the line on either side, communication could be most readily supplied by steam, at the same point w r ith the Residency and Coal Depot. 11. That a Coal Depot is an element which must now be considered on an increased and an increasing scale ; and that it would be advisable to have this depot at the entrance of the Gull for the following reasons :—That the colliers would thereby be saved the risk, delay, and cost of working up the Gulf against its prevailing wind, a nor'-wester ; that coal taken in at the mouth of the Gulf would be sufficient in every steamer (even when well laded) to run her up to her extreme possible terminus of Busreh or Koonah and back ; that the entrance of the Gulf is the point first reached by a steamer coming in from a distant port, and liable therefore to be short of coal; that the entrance of the Gulf is conveniently situate half way between Western India and Busreh ; that the great diffi culty ships coming to the Gulf trade experience is not arrival at the entrance, but the sailing up and down it ; and that, consequently, it maybe expected that, as trade developes, it might become convenient for it to be carried by sailing craft to Cape Mussundoom, and thence to be distributed round the Gulf and up the Tigris line by steamers, which, in like manner, would collect goods along the Gulf shores, and bring them to the central entrepot at Mussundoom. 12. That even political consideration, Persian territory is not so convenient for our purposes of a Residency, a Telegraph Station, a Coal Dep6t, and a free port of trade, as might be some other point in the Gulf. The Persians have some good qualities, but they are jealous and small-minded beyond any people I ever came across in the course of twenty-two years' travel Almost any Government in the world affords pri vileges of wholesome lodging to foreign representatives, but what is the fact at Bushire ? They would not allow the Resident to build a house, although such a house was essential to his health I When the question was referred to England, the Resident was reluctantly allowed to build a house of the dimensions of his tent! The Physician in charge of the Residency venturing to do the same, his house was pulled down by the order of the Persian Government and in contempt of the Resident : I give these facts simply in illustration of our political relations with Persia after forty years' diplomacy and great expenditure. The simple truth is, if I may be allowed to judge from my experience in the Legation at Teheran and here in the Residency, there will never be real political confidence on the part of Persia towards England so long as we attack her when she24 aggresses east\vard 3 and so long as we decline a defensive Treaty with her to the west« ward. So situate, our relations with Persia may be disturbed suddenly and overawed by Russia, or, from her own jealous temperament, Persia might interrupt our eastern communi cation via the Gulf in her jurisdiction before force or diplomacy could intervene to save them. 13. That at the present moment, and while all our relations with the Gulf are under reconsideration, it would, perhaps, be worthy the time of Government to solve permanently the following problem To find a point somewhere in the Persian Gulf which shall offer the following advan tages :— ist.—Centrality, as a free port, where trade may concentrate, where re-shipment may take place, and where goods transhipped may be most conveniently distributed. and.—Which shall possess centrality as a Telegraphic Station, and most readily afford means of maintaining on either hand communication by steamer in the event of accident to the cable. jrc?.—Which should be the most central and convenient point for a Coal Depot. Which should be the most dominating point for keeping the Sea-Police along the Pirate Coast, and for settling or preventing quarrels among the mari time Arabs with the least possible delay, with the minimum cost of fuel, and without taking the Resident to any great distance from his Head Quarters. 5M.—Which sould enable the Resident of the Gulf to manage, without embarrass ment, the relations in the Muscat as well as those in the Gulf, for the territories of Muscat are so mixed up with those of Persia and the Arabs, and its political relations are so interwoven with the politics of the Gulf, that it would be obviously, and a part even from reasons of finance, it would be very desirable that they should be under one and the same superintendence. Which might become a colony, or rather the inoculation, with an atom of civilized life, in the body of barbarism along the Arab coast, tending to expel that diseased barbarism by the wholesome, healthful, and slow, but natural, means of introduced civilization. I think you would find such means more permanent, and in the long run more successful, both towards suppressing piracy and slavery, than you will even find ships of war or menaces, etc., and visits of state from your Resident. 7M.—Which shall be as secure as practicable from political difficulties. 5/^.-—Which may afford us an indisputable title to the ground we occupy. gth. —Which may be sufficiently healthy, possess good water, and means of supply. /oM.—•Which may afford calm and sufficient anchorage. //tfA.—Which, in the event of war, should show us with the key of the Gulf in our bands. My opinion is, that some point near Cape Mussundoom, under the Sultan of our ally of Muscat, is the spot which all considerations indicate as that which should be our Port, our Political Residence, our Central Telegraph Station, our main Gulf Coal Depot, our Anti-slavery Station, and our fulcrum of general influence over the Gulf, ov ~ r . '' ra ^ e Coast, over Western Mekran, and over the Muscat coast, climate being sufficiently favorable. Lieutenant Stiff, I.N., just arrived at Bushire, assures me that such a point is hndable just west ot Mussundoom; that a few weeks ago, when on telegraphic duty. e visited a heaoland called, I think, Ras Sheikh, which slopes up in tongue-like shape to the height of feet, with good water and some cultivable ground at its base, with ample and land-locked anchorage, leading to a narrow neck of land some 400 yards wide, on the other side of which is a second inlet looking east of Mussundoom. I consider sueh a position, if sufficiently healthy, would be the best possible for your Gulf and Muscat Residency, and that the political business of both might thence be more efficiently managed than either can be separately from Bushire and Muscat. At al events, in the present conjuncture of your Persian Gulf affairs, it would be well, I think, for Government to go to some little trouble and expense to test accurately I am pe ^ 1 us ^ n ^ 00m dunn g th e approaching hot season ; and I am sure 1 ready to aid personally it, the experiment. thepIan ''W, pointed at be adopted, I should consider we did not lose much at Bushire; commercially, and when the Gulf Tigris line shall be fully developed,25 Bushire should not drain much trade beyond the arronHissement of Shiraz ; politically it forms part of the charge of Her Majesty s Mission at Tehran, and I do not think that Government in the least gains much by having the Residency in the town of Bushire, where there is little of real importance to transact, and where subordinates gossip, and have likings and dislikings, and these come to injure the Government business in the long run. The Residency at Bushire might be sold or disposed of as Government please : all that would be lost would be some little personal conveniences to the Resident and his Establish ment, and the possibility of retreat to the neighbouring hills. The immediate gains are, I think, obvious on reading the scheme map in hand : what the future gains might be would become more manliest should a crisis ever occur in our Red Sea line of communications. (Sd.) Lewis Pelly, Lieut.-Col., Acting PoltU Resident, Persian Gulf. No. 36, dated the 2nd February 1863. From —Lieutenant-Colonel Lewis Pelly, Acting Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Chief Secretary to Government in the Political Department, Bombay. I have the honor to request that you will favor me by causing the letter with appended memorandum, which I submitted on the 13th January 1863, without number, to be numbered in your office No. i-A. I now submit a second letter on the same subject, No. 2-A. No. a-A., dated Bushire, the 1st February 1863. From —liiutenant -CoLONBL Lewis Pbllt, Acting Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To—The Hon'ble Henry Lacon Anderson, Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay. In a memorandum appended to my letter, No. 1 A., of the 13th January 1886, I suggested the concentration of this Political Residency, Main Telegraph Station, and Coal dep6t at some spot near Cape Mussundoom, where a free port and depot might be devel oped at a point central between the Slave Channel at the entrance of the Gulf and the Pirate coast. 2. Some of the principal arguments recurring to me in favor of the scheme were summed up in the memorandum itself; and subsequent reflection tends to strengthen my conviction that it is possible for Government to create, supposing climate to be sufficiently bearable, near Cape Mussundoom, a settlement, which, from its geographical position, under a free rule. Would, before many years should elapse, become of considrable import ance, and lend to our interests and to our status, whether commercial or political, in the Persian Gulf, a character and a development which they do not at present possess, and which, perhaps, thej would not readily attain unless under some arrangement such as that proposed. 3. I believe that in a settlement of the nature suggested would be found the best means practicable for preventing slaves entering the Gulf ; of preventing piracy and dis turbance in the Gulf itself; of civilizing the maritime Arabs; of extending a healthful influ ence into Arabia on the one hand and into Western Mekran on the other: of offering to many Indian and other merchants now scattered round the shores of the Gulf an un molested refuge for the free prosecution of commerce; and finally, of giving to the ports of the Gulf in general an impetus and an example which, it might be expected, would in the end iuduce or compel the Governments of these ports either to imitate our system or risk the loss of their trade. 4. If Government should approve the proposal, among matters of detail to come under consideration would be the following jst.—'A. clear and valid written title should be obtained from the Sultan of Muscat for the land; and the conduct of this preliminary measure should, I think, be entrusted to cool and experienced hands : so conducted, it would probably be easily arranged ; but if any eccentricity were committed in this part of the business, much delay might ensue, i 2nd.~~T\ie neighbourhood of Mussundoom should be carefully examined, in view to selecting a spot suitable to the objects we have in view, in respect of water, extent of ground, non-command of position, calm and land-locked harbourage, &amp;c. C645FD26 yrd^Tht ground should be laid out with forethought, to meet possible distant fulure requirements ; the public stores and offices should be as compact as possible, and their site uncommanded whether by land or sea. Cuttings or seeds from trees found indigenous in the neighbourhood should, without loss of time, be planted along the proposed roads and in groups near the watering places and landing points. Emancipated slaves, at present agented by a Rupees 30 Moonshee at Bassidore, might aid in the public works as free men. 4th. —The old scantling of our camp houses at Bushire, still available / am told at Bombay, might be sent up for use. 5th. — Moving buoys should be laid down in the anchorage for the general con venience of shipping; the moorings for Her Majesty's ships being a little apart from the others. practicable, a serviceable road * should be made from the settlement along the coast line to the so-called Pirate towns and forts. A good caravanserai should be erected at the settlement terminus of this line for the convenience of all travellers, and 1 believe that the free, frequent, friendly, and beneficial interchange of visits which would then ensue, as between the maritime Arabs and the settlement, would do more to civilize the former and to open up Arabia to commerce and pro gress, than would do all the menaces that a Resident might fulminate from Bushire, and than all the annual visits of State that could be made before the year 1900: a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, and strong heal thy life expels disease by its very nature, Jth.—Notification should be made of the freedom of the port, and all people should be invited to settle there without any other condition than that of paying rent or purchase-money for the ground they might secure, and of becoming subject to any municipal rules which the community might impose on itself. r 8ih.~~No Turkish wall, no works with plunging fire would be required ; persons entering the settlement must come unarmed, and if any outrage occurred, punishment, severe but prompt, should be administered, and no further altercaiion or retaliation dreamed of. p^.—The Officer entrusted with the charge of the settlement should have full powers until all was settled; he could never have a fair chance of success if subordinates, whether afloat or ashore, were allowed to cavil or offer the vts inert tag. The Naval Force should consist of two handy screw steamers. Vessels on the more recent plan as to engines would be most efficient and cheapest in the long run. The title of Commodore or Senior Naval Officer (which in practice is only another name for Commodore, with the extra incon venience of the Officer by reason of his real want of rank being more than commodorely jealous of his dignity) should have no place in this little armament The vessel should be attached to the Chief of the settlement, and should be wholly at his disposal whether for anti-slave work, telegraph commumcatmn, suppression of piracy, conveyance of the Chief to other points of the Gulf, and for miscellaneous cruising and maintenance of peace along the Pearl Bank. As a general rule, one vessel should be on the move, the other in harbur ready to relieve or to meet accidents. functions of Government and the actions ot Government servants in the nanre !

The proposed settlement would flourish, I think, under any officer who would use common sense on its administration, and leave commerce and people in general to manage their own business. Perhaps, however, an officer who had been trained in a good school for general administration would be perferable to a mere diplomatist or a pure soldier, for the former is, perhaps, a little too prone to fancy work done when he has given the last polish to his despatch; and the latter, perhaps, occasionally forgets that Martial Law and the Habeas Corpus Act cannot co-exist in one and the same juris diction. P' S' Since writing this letter I have received and am transmitting Mr. Eastwick's despatch, No. 7, of 18th December 1862, advocating the establishment of a Vice-Admiralty Court for the Persian Gulf, &amp;c. It is, I believe, questionable whether we have a right to establish such a Court on foreign soil ; but the natural point for such a Court would be the settlement at Mussundoom. In brief, wherever I turn, I find reasons for selecting that as our fulcrum of influence in the Gulf, provided always that the climate he suffi ciently bearable. The whole drift, indeed, in Mr. Eastwick's despatch is to show the embarrassments which surrounded the administration of justice towards British subjects on Persian soil. I really cannot difine what my magisterial powers are as a Resident at Bushire ; nor do I perceive in what way I could punish a criminal. So far as my personal obser vation in Persia goes, I am disposed to think that our relations with this Government in regard to judicial matters are on a vague and unsatisfactory footing ; and that the obtain- ment of justice for a British subject depends more upon the personal influence which British representatives may possess with the Persian authorities, than upon the real merits of the plaintiffs case. AH this (in so far as the precincts of the Gulf are concerned) would be obviated by having our own port and settlement in the Gulf. I do not lay much stress on oaths as Mr, Eastwick seems to do. In my opinion, a law of perjury operates much like a law of usury. Since writing the foregoing I have received reliable intelligence of a point on the southern entrance of Elphinstone Inlet, which seems well suited to the requirement above enumerated. No. 6 -A,, dated Bushire, the 16th February 1863. From— Likutenant-Colonel Lewis Pelly, Acting Political Resident, Persian G»If, To— The Hon'ble Henry I-acon Anderson, Chief Secretary to Government, Bombay. I think the accompanying map* may illustrate • I beg the favor of the return of this map to to Government some of the points noticed in me - my letters No. i-A. and No. 3-A. Government will observe that for a Resident at Bushire, the nearest point of his .. , . . *1 general work is Bahrein over the water; the Nearly two hundred miles of sea distant. &amp; , , .. . map now sent shows that distance as the radius of the black circle. Were the Resident centered at Cassab, on the Mussundoom Promontory, not only M'ould he hold there his Residency, the Tele- Ras-al-Khyma, Amulgavme, Ejman, Debaye, graph, and Coal Depot, but the same radius of Aboothabee, all armme ra s. distance would embrace the districts of all the Arab Chiefs now enumerated, and would find them on the same shore with the Resident. It would further embrace our Agencies at Lingah and Bassadore ; our commercial interests at Bunder Abass ; our political influence in Western Mekran. It would comprehend finally the command of the Gulf entrance for trade and anti-slavery purposes during peace ; for military purposes in war. I have reliable ground for supposing that a point near Cassab, at the outer entrance of the Elphinstone Inlet, near Cape Mussundoom, is suitable to our object. I respectfully add a few disconnected results of thought bearing upon the question of the Persion Gulf trade and line of communication. When it was decided that the Imaumship of Muscat should henceforth be the two independent Sultanuts of Zanzibar and Muscat, that State, which had previously been a first- rate Asiatic Maritime Power, declined at such. While the Imaum held his richest territories in Africa, it was essential to maintain a fleet for political ends and to encourage traders. The genius of the Government as of the people was turned to seafaring. The Asian and African possessions mutually supplied and enriched each other ; they formed the web and woof of the home trade: now that these possessions are severed, and that, in28 the severance, jeslousy has been created, that Naval Force has been dividedj dismantled j the trade has declined ; and the conviction in the minds of the Arabs that trade between Zanzibar and Arabia is no longer profitable or safe, owing to the^ proceedings of our anti-slavery squadron, has yet further contributed towards that decline. A tendency of these circumstances is to confine the Muscat shipping to an Asiatic carrying trade • and bunder Abbas, which the Viz., Eastern Persia, Herat, etc. Sultan farms from Persia under a lease of which fruTtfuL 011 '^ ^ ^ ^ AbbaS iS some '3 years have yet to run, is its principal entrepot, and the natural port, perhaps, for goods entering or leaving a large portion of Southern Central Asia.

The only point which would be less dominated by the proposed arrangement at Cassab would be Bushire itself ; and this port de!..:hta.B 0 :S. t,ep ' P ray right ' 0a Resi - might, perhaps, be more properly watched by . _ . . a vice-Consul under the Legation at Tehran, since the port of Bushire and its containing Province are directly under the Shah's Govern ment. The Vice-Consul could communicate with the Resident upon matters affecting our Gulf interests. &amp; As to the trade of Bushire,^ the imaginative mind of Persia, embellishing all it touches, attributes to this the principal and almost sole seaport of the Persian Empire an incomparable commerce; but the common-place sense of an Englishman weighs upon the fact that a Government not celebrated for generosity compounds with its Governor for the Import and Export dues of Bushire at about Tomans 16,000 per annum. Suppose that, independently of indirect emoluments, the Governor clears Tomans 4,000 on the contrac 1, this gives a total of Tomans 20,000, which, at a 5 per cent, duty of the most favored nation, infers a total of exports and imports of Tomans 400,000 per annum. Equal to nearly half a million sterling. Double this total to prevent under-statement and , 1 , r . &amp; add half original total for contingency, and you have—a grand total of one million Tomans a Bagatelle. • A ? n K c,rcums 5 ance tliat tends to mislead in a trade like that of Persia is its being car- ^ X eastS 0 ! b '[ den - A , caravan trade s/iows large ; but there may be a good deal of beL tinkling under the mules necks, without much wool or cotton on their backs.

It is also, I hear, doubtful if the cable could be stretched over the breadth of soft mud belting the Delta sea line. Koweit is healthy, easily approached, and on the direct road for Kornah, at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. Koweit is, perhaps, the natural terminus for your sea-going steamers : as compared with Busreh it would save 70 miles of river navigation, and a long shallow entrance chan nel, and a bar. Busreh is very unhealthy moreover. Koweit is greatly more convenient for colliers and a coal depot. A boat canal might readily connect Koweit and kornah, or any other point on the Shaat-ul-Arab. The canal cutting would itself tend to regene rate the once fruitful soil along its banks. Koweit was the entrepot of the commerce of the east and west from the most ancient times of which we have record : it may be I believe during the Babylonian Empire or even ar gued that modern circumstances are different; before that time; mde accounts of Chaldsea and &gt; ^ -r --.i r n .i .• but if you will carefully examine the question, you may be struck with the fact that, taking the trade of the east and west in its large sense, from China to Western Europe, and explor ing its ramifications during a succession of centuries between those meridians, there is a marked tendency in trade to retrace its old lines under improved means of transit. Is it possible so to arrange as that vour line of trade, telegraph, and coal depots and political residencies along the entire GuH line may be coincident, and so preclude neces sity for change as the line becomes thoroughly developed? Perhaps this might be accom plished by selecting Cassab, A1 Mussundoom, as your point of entrance. The square- rigged ocean trade should then concentre there at a free port. Goods could be distributed round the Gulf in native craft or small steamers, tug or otherwise. Koweit would be the spot where the trade would take to river boats or caravans ; and where your last Sea Coal Depot and your first land Telegraph Station would be established. In providing for this line and reconsidering our position in the Persian Gulf, we might not be content with contemplating the present condition of affairs alone ; we might throw a forward glance over fifteen years or so, and reflect whether, during that period, the Turkish question must not pass through a crisis affecting our eastern interests ; whether, during that period, the reforms going on in Russia may not give to that free nation an impetus of expansion eastward, more rapid, more permanent, and more powerful, than any that we have yet had to apprehend from the arms of Russian serfs; whether countries, like Italy, now awakening to fresh industrial life, may not within that time claim to partake with us of Asiatic sources of wealth ; whether the molecular movements perceptible everywhere, in Southern Central Asia itself, may not give those countries an unprecedented importance for evil or for good ; whether it is possible, lastly, that Persia, now padded by Turkey, can be laid bare to the probe of European civilization, in her western side, and remain what she now is ? Are all these shadows, or are they giants coming in the distance, whom we must be prepared to meet? Be they what they may, as discerned from the political horizon, their arrival could scarcely be otherwise than beneficial to the trade, and, let us hope, to the people of Southern Central Asia; and it is from this trade point of view alone that I presume to cast a passing glance into a future, which Government must foresee from a far higher induction of causes than I can pretend to be informed of.

Lewis Pelly, Lieut.'Colonel, Acting Political Resident. C645FDResolution by the Hon 1 hie Board i dated the 13th May 1863, RESOLVED.— -These letters, like everything that proceeds from Colonel Felly's hands, have a merit apart from their immediate purpose. The Government may or may not be able to act on the Resident's suggestions, but the letters will constitute a valuable contri bution to our knowledge of the Gulf, and will supply facts and considerations which may hereafter exercise an unexpected influence in discussions connected with Persian or Arabian complications. The Hon'ble the Governor in Council concurs generally in the views submitted by the Resident as to the superiority of some place on the south-western shore of the Gulf to Bushire as the position of the Residency, but other considerations besides those of con venience or even appropriateness to the objects which the British Government contemplates in its policy in the Gulf must enter into the discussion. The removal of the Residency from Bushire to a Muscat port would excite the jealousy of Persia, which regards with an evil eye the operations of the Mekran Telegraph. On the other hand, any attempt to acquire a territorial possession in Arabia, however small, might lead to contingencies at present entirely unforeseen ; it would probably be regarded as the thin end of the wedge, and, notwithstanding all moderation and disinterestedness on our side, might involve the Government in antagonisms which it would be questionable policy to evoke. The Hon'ble the Governor in Council does not then deem it expedient to take action in any way on Colonel Felly's suggestions; but in justice to that intelligent and able officer he will forward copies of his communications for the consideration of the Government of India, accompanying those communications with a brief expression of the views contained in the present Resolution. 127. The Governinent of India do not seem to have passed any orders on the subject.3i CHAPTER III. Suggestions for improving British interests in Persia and the Persian Gulf t 1885-1886. 128. In December 1885 Mr. George S. Mackenzie made certain suggestions Secret e., Seprember 1886, Nqj. 409 412. to the India Office for improving British interests in Persia and the Persian Gulf. The questions raised by him were the following:— I*~~^ ur interests, both political and commercial, demand an improvement in our repre sentations in Persia. II-—-The country was formerly divided into provinces, each ruled over by an uncle of the Shah. ^ Since His Majesty's sons have come to power the southern provinces, where alone our interests lie, are ruled over by the Zil-es-Sultan, living at Ispahan and appointing Governors to the minor towns. III-y—The Governor of Bushire, where we have a Consul-General, ' with a large and ostentatious staff, ' is a native merchant. At Ispahan, the centre of Government, we are represented by an Armenian news-writer without weight either with Europeans or natives. I^**''lt i s evident that a fresh disposition of our political establishments in the Gulf is much needed. At present they are identical with those of the East India Company, only more costly. V.—Mr. Mackenzie is accordingly of opinion that our Consul-General should reside at Ispahan. He would there be in direct contact with the Zil-f s-Sultan ; who rules over Luristan, Arabistan, Fars, and Kirman, i e., the whole of Southern Persia. VI.—-Wherever he resides our Consul-General should have non-trading Consuls or Vice-Consuls under him, one residing in Kirman Shah, one at Shiraz, and another at Seyd or Kirman. J VII.-—Bushire, being only of importance as a shipping port, might well be represented by a Vice-Consul or Native Agent under the Consul at Basra, who with Vice-Consuls at Muscat and Bahrein could control the whole Arab Coast and Persian Gulf proper. VIII —When the present establishments were opened there were neither steamers nor telegraphs in the Gulf. Now that there are both, the necessity for expensive gun-boats no longer exists. IX»—The existing arrangements are in fact out of date and answer no purpose pro portionate to the cost of maintaining them. X.—The new arrangements proposed would not perhaps effect a saving, but would certainly be more efficient in regaining the security we have been of late so steadily losing and would tend to the development of British trade and interests in Southern Persia. 129. The following were the observations made by Colonel Ross on Mr. Secret E., October .886, No. 388. Mackenzie's suggestions (letter dated 12th September 1886) Before commenting on Mr. Mackenzie's special proposals, it is necessary to suggest qualification of some of his statements. With reference to the position of the Zil-es-Sultan, it is not quite accurate to say that the whole south of Persia is now governed by him. The towns and districts of Bunder Abbas and Lingah are not under His Royal Highness at all, and Bunder Abbas is about the most rising seaport in the Gulf and may before long become a point of great importance in other ways. It is also to be borne in mind that the Zil-es-Sultan's residence at Ispahan is not necessarily permanent. Indeed within the last year there was twice some chance of hi&lt;? going to other posts. By the time Mr. Mackenzie's Consul-General reaches Ispahan there may be no Prince Zil-es-Sultan there to influence. It is not at present the case that the Governor of Bushire is a merchant. The present Governor was in that position when the British occupied Bushire in 1856, and was carried prisoner to Bombay. But this is an unimportant detail, and the merchant alluded to was Governor for some time. I do not think it is correct to say that the political establishments in the Persian Gulf are identical with what they were originally in the days of the East India Company. On the contrary the residents were originally commercial agents and the present political establishments have grown with the requirements of the times, lam not aware that to everybody who has resided in the country it is evident that a fresh disposition is much needed. I am at least an exception. The scheme proposed by Mr. Mackenzie is, that the Persian Gulf Residency and Muscat Political Agency should be abolished, and that a Consul-General should be placedat Ispahan with subordinate Consuls and Vice -Consuls, and Native Agents at Karmanshah, Shiraz Yezd or Kerman, and Bushire, whilst the control of the Persian Gulf and Arab Coast including Muscat should be placed under the Consul at Busrah. who should have a Vice-Consul or Native Agent under him at Bushire, with Vice-Consuls at Bahrain and Muscat. No reasons are given in Mr. Mackenzie's first letter for transferring the Persian Gulf and Littoral and the Arab Coast and Muscat to the Consul at Busrah, but in a subse- quent letter he explains that the questions arising on the Arab Coast appertaining almost exclusively to Turkey would be more directly treated through the Busrah Consulate and the Governor-General of that province. Is it intended that the Consul at Busrah should also obtain the co-operation of the Turkish Naval Force in maintaining the maritime peace, as the disappearance of the British Navy from the scene is recommended. The proposal is based on an obviously erroneous assertion./ The suggestion of the withdrawal of our Navy from the Gulf is supported by a reason, ?/&gt;., that ' formerly there were neither steamers nor telegraphs in the Gulf, now there are both, ' therefore, it is argued, the pre sence of our Navy is unnecessary. I cannot say that experience has warranted this con clusion, and the general proposition that, when there are steamers and telegraphs, naval force is unnecessary will scarcely command assent. The maintenance of the Persian Gulf Residency is, I hold, a matter of some importance to India in a political sense apart from commercial considerations. A position and prestige has been built up in that region which should not lightly be abandoned. I recollect reading in a memorandum written by Sir Owen Burne on Lord Mayo's administration that our policy in the Gulf and its results were subjects of unmixed satisfaction. It is certainly regarded by the peoples of those parts as of importance, and by foreigners with some envy. Thousands of natives of India pass up the Gulf yearly and carry back to thousands cf homes in India their impressions of the widespread power and influence of England. A withdrawal such as advocated by Mr. Mackenzie would with reason be regarded as an evidence of our decline and failing strength. I have hitherto treated of the expediency or advisability of the suggestions, but I have to add that I consider them in some ways impracticahle. I do not think that the Foreign Office would ever consent to put a rival authority to that of the Legation in Central Persia, and even if they tntertain the proposal,.! do not think the Persian Government would easily agree to it. They would probably urge that such a startling change would lead to Russia demanding corresponding privileges in Persia, and would certainly rouse attention and activity in her diplomacy. I had some suspicions when in the Gulf that Russia might develop shortly an interest in the direction of Bander Abbas. Neither the motives nor the signs were entirely wanting. The effacement of our prestige in the Persian Gulf recommended by Mr. Mack enzie might be considered a favorable opportunity for other powers to replace us there, and indeed I have no doubt his scheme, so far as the Gulf is concerned, would be heartily applauded both by Russia and Turkey. ,, 129-A. No action was taken on this correspondence. . I 3 a 1887-88 projects were under consideration for strengthening our 1 un nCe ' n ^ &gt;ers ^ a ' especially by way of the Karun river. As to these schemes, the Persian Arabistan Precis will have to be read (see Chapters IV et seq).2.Z) ) 33 CHAPTER IV. General Policy in the Gulf, 1899-1903. (0 Lord Curzon's Despatches on the foreign activity in the Persian Gulf and measures to be taken to maintain our interests. 131. We have enumerated above the several evidences of Foreign activity in the Persian Gulf, of which we find increasing number at the advent of Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India, and which threatened our old interests in many quarters in the Persian Gulf and Oman. With the intimate knowledge His Excellency came equipped with the forces in operation in the Gulf, there was no chance of our interests being neglected in that quarter. The energetic measures taken to thwart French intrigues in Oman and German and Turkish intrigues at Koweit, and to strengthen our position in Bahrein form the subjects of separate precis. Apart from this Lord Curzon's Government set to take a comprehensive review of the situation in the Gulf and Persia and suggest the remedies, and their views and suggestions were set forth in an elaborate despatch which marks an epoch in history of the Persian and Persian Gulf politics. 132. This is the Despatch No. 175-Sec.—Ext., dated 21st September 1899. c .,, ». q „ m Adequate reason for it was found in the Secret E., November 1899, Nos. IO-I I. r ~ tact that the Secretary of State in his Despatch No. 10-Sec., dated 30th June 1899, invited the opinion of the Govern ment of India on a despatch from Sir M. Durand, dated 12th February 1899, in which be expressed his opinion on certain suggestions for the appointment of Consular Officers in Persia and submitted his own proposals for maintaining our interests in Persia and the Persian Gulf. Independently of this the Govern ment of India felt bound to address the Secretary of State on the subject. 133. The Despatch of September 1899 began by pointing out that there was o no clear definition of the principles upon Lord Curzon s Despatch of 21 st September j 899. .. . .. i tV - • i r ^ which our policy towards Persia is based, of the objects which it should keep in view, and of the scope and limits of the respective shares of responsibility, political and financial, which should be assumed by the two partners, vzz^, Her Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India, who are jointly concerned in the defence of Anglo-Indian interests in the dominions of the Shah. The need for such a discussion as to how British interests should be definitely safeguarded in the future, and how the necessary outlay should be shared between Great Britain and India was made imperative by the existence of signs that the dissolution of Persia is drawing near. The rule of the present Shah is weaker than that of his predecessor, the encroachments of Russian power are less veiled by any pretence of concealment, and other Governments and nationalities are being attracted to the scene. 134. Anglo-Indian Interests in Persia, the despatch continued, are commer cial, political, strategical, and telegraphic. The total annual value of British trade with Persia has been cautiously estimated at three-and-a-half millions sterling, of which the south and eastern portion belongs to India, the north and western more peculiarly to the British Isles. 135. The political interests of Great Britain In Persia, though in the main Indian in inception, and still largely Indian in character, are also Imperial, now that Persia has been drawn into the vortex of European politics. Equally is Persia in its strategical aspect not only an Indian but an Imperial con cern, when the boundaries of Afghanistan, guaranteed by Great Britain, march for many hundreds of miles with Persia, when Persian territory is coterminous with Baluchistan, and when pressing upon Persia is the ever-growing power of the Russian Empire. The telegraphic interests of Great Britain in Persia are evenly divided between the mother-country and India, the line from Tehran to the North-West Frontier being in the hands of a London company, while from Tehran onwards to the Gulf the undertaking is conducted by an establish ment recruited and paid for by the Government of India, although 30 per cent, of the total traffic consists of messages between Great Britain and the colonies C645FD34 beyond India.® The position was thus established that Persia is emphatically an Imperial interest of Great Britain, and that the latter should be prepared to exert her full strength for the defence of that interest. There was no desire to add to the political or territorial responsibilities of India or to disturb the status quo in Persia ; for the present, our objects were merely to secure the interests already built up. 136. The despatch then proceeded to draw a picture of the present state of British interests and to examine the dangers by which they are threatened. It pointed out that the political destinies of Persia are determined by her geogra phical position in relation to her neighbours, and while there is a curious correspondence, there are also notable differences between the positions of Russia and Great Britain vis-a-vis with Persia, which must give Russia in the north a power of persuasion and menace greater than that possessed by Great Britain in the south. It is not surprising, therefore, that the supremacy of Russia in the north should be increasing, and it follows that though we should try to preserve what remains of our trade in Northern Persia and to assert British influence in Tehran as much as possible, our energies will be best directed to the preservation of our interests in the centre and south. 137. The despatch then defined the de facto and de jure position in the Persian Gulf to be as follows The de jure position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag of all nations the northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia while its western and southern coasts are partially owned and partially claimed hv Turkey or are in the occupation of Arab tribes, who have entered into treaty relationship of varying character, constituting a sort of veiled Protectorate, with Great'Britain. The islands in the Gulf are owned either by Persia, or by Arab Chiefs (in the case of Bahrein under British protection) ; but upon one of the Persian Islands, via., Kishm, Great Britain possesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Maskat, to which the ishnd once belonged. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included in the same politi cal system are, on the northern shore of the Arabian Sea,!the coasts of Persian Baluchistan, along which the overland wires of the Indo-European Telegraph Company run as far as Jask where a leserve of English territory exists under an agreement concluded in i887 between the British and Persian Governments, where a detachment of Indian Troops, who had previously been stationed therebetween the years iSjgand 1887, was replaced in January 1898, in consequence of a murder of a British telegraph official and the disturbed state of Persian Baluchistan. A larger detachment was at the same time despatched to Charbar near the eastern units ot the same province. On the southern and western coasts is the still independent kingdom or Sultanate of Oman (Maskat). The de/acto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a early vears 1 ^ ^e DreTenf r rnl t ianCe th^ an i P^ cedin g P a ^ P h might indicate. In the early years of the piesent century, the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of nfe * 1°^ stogie with the Ar.b pirates who e.ted its southern coastb Ihisconflct which was conducted entirely by British Agency treaty relation's \vith the P t 0n ! the P 'sian Government, resulted in the establishment of treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which thev bound them - B sHre ^ 311 di ^ teS to Brtfish R^sidSrat tained isthe l«uenft ,l?

In the bame three years, out of a total of 2,161 steamers which entered and cleared from the Gulf ports, 2,039 were British, and their tonnage repre sented 84 per cent, of the total tonnage. If the returns of Persian ports alone be required, the figures are total trade, £11,172,000, of which local trade £2,169,400 and external trade £9 ,002 ,600, the British proportion of the latter being £7,494,200, or 83 per cent. To these totals in either case there should, in our opinion, certainly be added those of Basra, which amounted in the same triennial period to £2,157 ,300. Unfortunately the manner ^in which these have been prepared, do not admit of our distinguishing the countnes ol origin or destination. 1 he proportion, however, that should properly be assigned to Anglo-Indian commerce may be inferred from the British percentage of shipping, that entered or cleared from that port in the three years referred to. It amounted to no less than 93 per cent, both of the number and tonnage of the steamers engaged. During the last thirty years the maintenance of the submarine cables of the Indo- European Telegraph Company from Fao to Jask, and of the land lines fiom that plact. to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Government, and has tended to increase an already preponderant influence over both the waters and the shores of this sea. Latterly there has been a deliberate but necessary consolidation ot our influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremiiy of the Gulf, we have, under instructions from Her Majesty's Government, entered _ into engage ments with the still independent Sheikh of Koweit, by which he has bound himself and his successors not to receive the representative of any oilier Power and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power—a proceeding which was dieted by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority and by the incipien. intrigues of other Powers. Similar machinations are known to be in progress^ at Bahrein and will require to be counteracted bv a more strict enforcement of the condition to which the Sheikh is by treaty bound. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included within the sphere of its political influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo-Indian hands, and its ruler has not merely for years been subsidised by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered into an Agreement with us, under the orders of Her Majesty s Government, not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838 to 1842, and again in 1856-57. Bushire was held during the latter years as also were Muhammara and Ahwaz upon the Karun, '1 he occupation of these piaces was an illustration of the vigour with which in past years our ascendancy has been main tained. Their abandonment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been dis played to emphasise or to perpetuate these responsibilities. The latter, however, no less than the British position in Southern Persia in general, are now threatened by aa external competition, to the evidences of which we next turn. 138. The despatch detailted the vorious ways in which Russia, France and Germany had been displaying an ever-increasing interest in the Persian Gulf and Oman. It was shown how there was more than a mere coincidence in the simul taneous movements in these regions. 1 on. Referring to Germany, it was explained that her interest has been the historical, and perhaps the natural, sequel of a commercial policy that has for some time aimed at securing the control of the principal railways m the 1 urkish dominions in Asia Minor, and of a political ambition that more recently still, would appear to aim at the protection of the Ottoman Empire, alike m liurope and Asia. The obvious corollary to a system of German railways m Asia Minor would be similar rail-roads to the Persian border and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf. Prolongation of the Turko-German railways to Baghdad and to the Persiah Gulf had been and were still being freely discussed ; and the German Government were endeavouring to procure an interest in the overland i urkish Telegraph Fao. 14.0. While the Government of India regarded these symptoms of increas ing German interest in the Persian Gulf as emphasising the international aspect which the Persian question appeared more and more destined to assume, and therefore as adding to the complexities of an already sufficiently^ difficult s^tua- tion they would not question the bond fide commercial enterprise which was carrying German trade there, as to so many other open seas and ports in the world, and it was conceivable that we might even find, in the existence of36 German political Interests, an occasionally or safeguard for our own. German interests, however, had a tendency to grow with some rapidity, and by steps which are not always acceptable to their neighbours. Hence the need for an early decision upon the future policy to be adopted by Her Majesty s Govern ment was not diminished, but was enhanced, by the appearance of so active a competitor upon the scene. 141. These symptoms of external interest in Persia and the Gulf collectively indicate the polic}' and ambitions of foreign Powers, and impress the fact that in an area, by land and by sea, which Great Britain regards with good reason as falling within her sphere of influence, that influence is being directly and increasingly challenged by other nations, who, in proportion as their foothold becomes more securely established, will resist any preferential claims upon whatever foundation in history or on fact they may rest, and will claim for themselves an equality of right which in theory it may be difficult to contest. With regard to the advance of Russia, the despatch continued : ' we desire deliberately to say to Your Lordship, with a full consciousness of our responsibility in so saying, that difficult as we find it in existing circumstances to meet the financial and military strain imposed upon us by the ever-increasing proximity of Russian Power upon the northern and north-western frontiers of India from the Pamirs to Herat, we could not contemplate without dismay * the prospect of Russian neighbourhood in Eastern or Southern Persia, the inevitable consequence of which must be a great increase of our burdens ; while the maritime defensibility of India would require to be altogether reconsidered, were the dangers of a land invasion to be supplemented by the appearance of a possible antagonist as a naval power in waters contiguous to Indian shores.' It should be a cardinal axiom of British policy that His Majesty's Government will not acquiesce in any European Power, and more especially Russia, overrunning Central and Southern Persia, and so reaching the Gulf, or acquiring naval facilities in the latter even without such territorial connections. 142. Such being the existing situation and the principles of His Majesty's Government, the despatch proceeded to discuss the manner in which those principles should be translated into action, and the steps which should be taken for the protection of the common interests of Great Britain and the Indian Empire. 143. Explicit assurances concerning the integrity and independence of Persia have been exchanged and repeated between the Governments of Great Britain and Russia, beginning with the assurance entered into by Lord Palmerston and Count Nesselrode in 1834, and ending with the confirmation of the same by M. de Giers in 1888. But such pledges are in themselves quite insufficient to arrest the centripetal progress of Russian influence in Persia, or to save either the Persian Kingdom, or British interests in it, from the erosive agencies described. It is therefore necessary to examine the alternative policies. The first of these is the policy of a regeneration of Persia by Anglo-Russian means, but such friendly co-operation is out of the question, because Russia is interested, not in the reform of Persia but in its decay, an illustration of which is seen in the renewal in 1899 of the agreement entered upon in 1889, by which Persia bound herself not to grant any railway concessions to any other Power than Russia except with the consent of the latter for a period of ten years. 144' The question is then discussed whether though it be impossible to con clude an agreement with Russia for the joint patronage and development of Persia, it might not be possible to arrange for a recognition of British and Russian spheres of interest in the dominions of the Shah, on lines analogous to the agreement concluded between England and Russia as to spheres of interest in relation to railways in China. Such an agreement might be equally extended to mines, roads, and other industrial or economic undertakings, and wou to a certain degree extend to political influence also, even though not express y mentioned, as in eastern countries it is in the wake of railways and trade that political influence is most apt to follow. The line across Persia would have to be drawn so as to include Kashan and Seistan in the British37 sphere, and it would be manifestly difficult to arrive at an engagement that no political influence should be exercised by either party on the opposite side of the line, since it would be out of the question to remove the British representa tives, either at Tehran, Tabriz or Meshed, while corresponding objection would no doubt be felt by the Russian Government, But even an engagement limited to railway and commercial exploitation would have considerable value. The following difficulties and drawbacks in the case of such an un derstanding were then discussed. The line proposed is not altogether assisted by geographical conditions, Seistan being physically and administratively a part of the province of Khorasan, and it is doubtful whether Russia would forego her designs upon Seistan and a port on the eastern extremity of the Persian Gulf. A more serious drawback, however, is the fact that the capital of Persia would lie in the Russian sphere, and the pressure exercised by the Russian Government would become overwhelming, the Shah would tend more and more to become a Russian puppet, and Northern Persia a Russian procon sulate. The fate of such institutions as the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Indo-European Telegraph Department would be more than doubtful, the weight and influence of Russia throughout Central Asia would be increased and the ultimate result might be the permanent break-up of the Persian king' dom. Nor would this policy prevent Russia from approaching the Persian Gulf via Baghdad, or other countries from attempting to acquire the position in Southern Persia from which Russia had debarred herself. But, while not sanguine of success, the Government of Lord Curzon expressed themselves of opinion^ that the experiment was worthy of being made, in the interest both of Persia itself, and still more harmony between the two great Powers, upon whose relations the peace of Asia depends. Such a contract, even if not of perpetual duration, would be of immense value in the respite afforded from the strain of an otherwise ceaseless rivalry and in the opportunity presented for a peaceful consolidation of existing interests. 145. Should, however, the endeavour to arrive at an understanding with Russia fail, then it would still be possible to fall back upon the alternative policy recommended by Sir M. Durand, which was that we should plainly intimate that any Russian encroachments in Northern Persia will provoke corresponding measures for the protection of British interests in the south. 146. The despatch then turned to the increase of the Consular establish ments in Persia and the principle on which the cost should be met by Great Britain or India. 147. On examination of the cost of the various establishments maintained by the British Government in Persia, it was shown that the Imperial Government spent ^15,460 and the Government of India ^61,052 per annum, or, if Turkish Arabia were included in the calculation, the totals amounted to Great Britain 5)597) India ^71,056, contributions which did not at all fairly represent the respective proportions of Imperial and of Indian interests in Persia and its sur roundings. Two principles might with advantage be borne in mind in distri buting such charges between Great Britain and India, either that the entire charges might be added together and might be divided in certain proportions between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, or that the spheres in Persia of special concern either to Her Majesty's Government or to the Government of India might be determined, and the charges incurred for them debited against the revenues respectively of the United Kingdom and of India. This was the solution which the Government of India would prefer. ■48. The real line of distinction, the despatch continued, should be that, whereas the commercial interests of Her Majesty's Indian subjects, outside of India, are in the main the concern of the Imperial Government, yet in cases where the political importance of a place or district exceeds the commercial, and where that political importance is Indian rather than English in character, the Gov ernment of India may legitimately be called upon to defray sometimes a large proportion, sometimes the whole of the cost. The despatch then proceeded to apply these principles to a consideration of certain suggestions of Sir M. Durand and certain proposals of the Government of India concerning the increase of Consular establishments in Persia. The changes and additions which have in consequence been made during Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty will be separately mentioned below.* • As regards Consular appointments and escorts see Persian Coast and Islands fVecis, i 854- I 90 S i Sections XXXIII —XXXVIII. Bahrein Precis, Chapters LVil-LXI. Arabittan Precis, Chapter VU, C645FD149- On 16th March 1900, His Excellency the Viceroy followed up this despatch with a telegram to the Secretary Secret E .July 19C0, Nos. 146-147. of for p oint i ng ou t that it Was six months since the Government of India addressed Her Majesty's Government with regard to the position in Persia, to Russian designs upon that country, and to the steps that should be taken for the protection of British interests^ notably in the centre and south, and in the Persian Gulf. No reply had been received from Her Majesty's Government:— ' In the interval, the Russian attitude towards Persia and towards British interests in that country has been more clearly defined by the negotiation of a loan which is tantamount to Russian control over the greater part of Persia, including several of those provinces that appertain to the British sphere of interest and trade; by the appointment of a Russian Consul to Seistan ; by the well authenticated reports of Russian railway schemes in different parts of the country ; and by the appearance in the Persian Gulf of a Russian gun-boat, whose com mander, in defiance of the assurances given by the Russian Government, is believed to have entered into negotiations with the local authorities for a coaling station at Bander Abbas.' 150. Now that the strain of the war in South Africa was to some extent relieved, the Government of India desired most urgently to represent that the situation in Persia was one that could not be indefinitely ignored, and they submitted the desirability of making some clear announcement to the Persian Government concerning the nature and extent of the interests of Great Britain and India in Southern Persia, presuming it was intended that they should be maintained :— ' Repeated but cautious statements of British concern in those quarters have been authorised at lehran. But they do not appear to have been couched in a form sufficiently definite to secure their object, or to have obtained from the Persian Government the respect to which they are entitled.

We think that the extent to which she is permitted to do so still depends even more upon the action of Her Majesty's Government than it does upon her own. Neither do we recognise any reflection of our own views or utterances in the remark that it c?n hardly be maintained that in view of foreign competition, civilised powers can be permanently denied the benefit of access to the ports of Persia^ because their admission will infringe upon a monopoly which we have hitherto enjoyed/ ' If the reference is to access by sea, clearly such approach never has been or would ever be likely to be denied by Great Britain. If the reference is to access by land, we have never said anything to deprecate the connection of the Persian ports by railway with the interior, and the free use of such ports by the subjects or merchandise of Foreign Powers. What we have all along deprecated and must continue to deprecate is that any such railways, leading to ports within a sphere in which British interests are unquestionably predominant, and in which it cannot be alleged that any Foreign Power possesses any interest comparable with our own,-—should be constructed as the instruments of political or military ambition, an should terminate in maritime exits, which might before long be converted into the coaling stations or the naval bases of foreign fleets. We have no objection whatever to he cons truction of railways in the south or in any other part of Persia, though we entertain the liveliest doubt as to whether in a country as backward and so mountainous they would ever repay the expense of construction. All that we maintain is that, if Persia decides to con struct railways in the south, she should not do so except with our consent, and &gt; lf P ossl with our co-operation ; and that the so-called development of the country should not be made an excuse for open and flagrant detriment to British interests. ' We rejoice to think that on this point we share the views that are apparently held by Her Maiesty's Government. At least this is the inference that we draw from the intimation that was authorised by the Marquis of Salisbury to the Persian Government 0 ' th e 4 h P^ last in which the present Shah was reminded of the promise of his father, the late S , &lt; that no southern railway concession shall be granted to any foreign companv without consultation with Her Majesty's Government.' We confess, however ' f 0 a ^ckde the general character or the particular terms of this pledge are such the Persian Government from entering into engagements, even with regard to railway matters in Southern Persia., with a Foreign Power or Powels ' even while observing the letter of the late Shah s promise, and which might be extremely fnTurls to the intefests which it is our duty to defend.

Russian ambition to construct a Railway line through Persia and acquire a part in the Persian Gulf, 1901. 153.

Secretary of State fo r India another Secret e., november igoi, No. 61. despatch on the general question of Per sian affairs especially Russian ambition to construct a railway through Persia and acquire a part in the Persian Gulf:— ' In our despatches of aist September 1899 and 6th September 1900, we have already fully acquainted Your Lordship and His Majesty's Government with the views which are entertained by us with regard to British interests and British policy in Persia. Subsequent events have more than confirmed the forecasts that were contained in our earlier letter, and have lent additional weight to our appeal for a clear and emphatic enunciation of British policy in regard to that country. The negotiations for a further Russian loan to the Persian Government, and for a new Commercial Treaty, designed in the interests of Russian and to the detriment of British trade ; the apparently imminent construction of a Russian railway from Ashkabad to Meshed, the capital of Khorasan ; the activity of Russian representatives and agents in Seistan and the regions contiguous to the Baluch border ; the obstacles placed in the way of the Nushki-Seistan trade route by Russian influence, both in respect of customs arrangements and of quarantine ; the appearance of Russian Consular Agents and of a mercantile service subsidised by the Russian Government in the Persian Gulf—all of these circumstances illustrate the rapidity with which the weakness of Persia is being turned to account by her powerful neighbour ; while they also testify to the unswerving purpose with which the police of the Russian Government is directed to an obvious and unmistakable gold» ^We have so recently submitted to Your Lordship our views of the imperative necessity of making up our minds as to the point to which these ambitions may safely be pursued without coming into direct collision with British and Indian interests, and of shaping our future action, both diplomatic and commercial, accordingly, that we do not propose upon the present occasion to trouble Your Lordship with any repetition of opinions with which you are already familiar. It is sufficient to say that the events of the past two years have but strengthened the unanimity and force of the conviction to which we have previously given expression ; and that, in our judgment, the question of Persia and the Persian Gulf is on the verge of becoming the most critical issue of Central Asian politics /hat these views are not substantially dissented from His Majesty's Government is apparent trom the telegraphic information which has reached us from Your Lordship since the above paragraph was written—to the effect that the British representative at St Peters burg has been authorised to speak frankly to the Russian Foreign Minister concerning he respective parts that should be played by Great Britain and Russia in the future main tenance and development of the Persian Kingdom. 2, T ? n i h f preSei l-. occ £ as [ on wr a f dress Yo ^ Lordship with another though correlative object. The determination of the attitude which is to be adopted by the British Government dirbrJf the conditionswhich we have described, while to a large extent dependent upon declarations or pledges already made, and upon the traditional history of British policv in those regions, must also be greatly affected by a consideration of the practical effect likely to be produced upon Br itish interests in the future by a continuance of, or an abrupt departure from, those traditions. We take it to have been a common-place of British statesmanshin throughout the past century that in Southern Persia and the Persia Gulf British influence should remain supreme ; W while at no time could the commercial competition of Powers be reasonably resented or legitimately opposed yet the creation of TiS C0Ul ir 0t be t R ermitted &gt; seriously co m p/amising tfie interests of India and therefore of Great Britain We know of no Indian Adminis- MoreTecenthfwe State5me ( n &gt; ^ ^ ^ bssx s - ~s..i sS —*•« 5 as&amp;z ss; ts Government, due weight will be attached to thla'prea.' 1 '' ^ tak&lt;:n by H ' S MajCSty ' S Maie2'sw' V „ e ment re /r! , ,.. d h eCi&lt;ied t0 Send t0 YoUr Lordshi P for communication to His aspect of the case which has been written by His' Etc eUenc™ tlu'rc'''' a M ', nut ® 011 , t . bi ® ^hil! : e t!,e e re t0 is r TO 0 nbj 0 ection'o^he gran'tb.r'f ^ endorse t . h ® v ' ew expounded by hinUhat, by Persian ^^0^ wis! to r LJ tl,e P « s «n Gulf, mercantile necessities or the expandin' mtuire^ents'of ' Fore 'S' l J ower, as their own tion of political interests or rights by the Russian ma ^ dema nd, the acquisi- fraught with positive danger to the security of the T Jf in ™ ent . ln those quarters would be such idea or proposal may continue in the future as it hTs 1 ^ We h0pe that any the strenuous opposition of His Majesty's Government'' in the past, to meet with1Q] 41 Minute by His Excellency the Viceroy on Russian ambitions in Eastern Persia and the Persian Gulf. It may be safely assumed that the great activity now being shown by the Russian Gov ernment and by Russian agents in the direction of Khorasan, Seistan, Sarhad, and Eastern Persia in general, arises, partly from alarm at the success that is attending the Indian trade route to Seistan and the marked revival of British interest in that part of Indian frontier, still more from a desire, while Great Britain is otherwise engaged, to accelerate that solution of the Central Asian question to which, ever since the apocryphal will of Peter the Great, Russian ambitions have been fondly turned, vis., the absorption of Persia, the connection of Russian territories by railway with the Indian Ocean, and the acquisi tion of a fortified naval base in the Persian Gulf. I propose to examine how far the realisation of these ambitions would be injurious to British interests ; a conclusion upon which point is a necessary preliminary to the decision how far they should either be tacitly acquiesced in or openly opposed. 3. The argument that Russia can safely be permitted to secure a maritime outlet for herself in the Persian Gulf, and that it is desirable that Great Britain should assist, or at least not withstand, her in that consummation rests upon a fundamental confusion of ideas. Those who employ it fail altogether to discriminate between commercial pleas and political ambitions. It may be urged that, whereas Russian manufacturers, in their attempt to gain access to Eastern markets, are at present compelled to make the long and circuitous journey by the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea, before they can reach the Indian Ocean, it would be an advantage could they be transported by rail roads either from the Caucasus, or from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf; although the apparent value of such a gain would probably be a good deal discounted in practice by the comparatively limited trade of Russia (which, however, may admit of a considerable deve lopment in the future), still more by the superior cost of land carriage over sea carriage. In so far as these are the ambitions of Russia, it is not probable that any one would seri ously resist their satisfaction. They can be accomplished—provided the money be forth coming—by amicable arrangements with Persia and with Great Britain. I am not myself a believer in the paying capacities of a trans-Persian line for many years to come. The country itself is poor, and cannot furnish either the capital or the traffic. Were the line, however, an open line, it might conceivably attract the Russian trade from one end, and the Indian trade from the other, which would enable it to subsist. It is also conceivable that capitalists might be willing to come forward and construct it, though were I a capitalist, I should not be found among their number—and arrangements might be made by which, while the line remained Persian property, the construction and maintenance of the northern portion might be entrusted to Russia, and those of the southern portion to Great Britain, a joint guarantee of the three Governments being applied to the whole. This railway might terminate on tin Gulf in a Persian port, open to the commerce of all nations, but subject to the import and export dues prescribed by the Persian tariff. I should myself regard such a venture as premature and as speculative in the highest degree ; but I do not see any thing in it that need necessarily arouse political jealousy or international complications. 3. This, however, though the sentimental advocates of handing over Persia to Russian influence do not, as a rule, see it, is not in the least what Russia wants. What she desires is a railway built exclusively by Russian capital, managed and officered entirely by Russian agents, constructed not for commercial^ but for political and strategical objects, and terminating in a Russian, as distinct from, a Persian, port that would presently be converted, not merely into a coaling station, but into a fortified naval base on the Indian Ocean. Such of the advocates to whom I have alluded to at all realise this conception defend it upon the following grounds. 4. It is said that ports do not give sea-power, and that a Russian port in the Persian Gulf would in no wise add to her strength, because she has no fleet adequate to defend it. This might be true as long as Russia consented to remain solely or mainly a land-power. But the answer is clear that Russia has no fleet (or little to speak of) only because she has few ports; and that as soon as her maritime outlets are secured and fortified, the fleet will follow with no delay and in proportionate strength. If we project our gaze for only a short distance into the future, and contemplate the time when Russia will have secured the free passage of the Bosphorus and the Dardanalles, when she will have obtained a naval station somewhere in the Red Sea, when a coaling station will have been conceded to her in Siamese waters, when her position in Manchuria has been firmly established, and when its maritime outlets at Talienwan and Port Arthur, if not in a Korean harbour or island as well, have been fully developed i'none of these bring far-fetched or extravagant hypotheses)'—still more if a naval base in the Persian Gulf be added to their number—can any one doubt that the fleet would promptly be forthcoming, or that Russia would emerge as one of the great naval powers of the future ? 5. Secondly, it is contended that a Russian port and trade in the Indian Ocean would be absolutely at the mercy of the British fleet. This of course depends in the main upon the strength of our naval resources in Eastern waters as compared with those which Russia would maintain. The balance is at present entirely in one direction. That it would long remain C645FD ■ \ ■1 r I I42 so is open to grave doubt. But this plea rests upon a further double misconception which in spite, or perhaps in consequence of its extraordinary popularity, it is necessary to expose. It postulates that the naval base, once secured, would he left unfortified and open to attack. The precedent of Port Arthur does not encourage this amiable illusion. Just as by the expenditure of millions of roubles that naval station has, in a surprisingly short time, been rendered practically invulnerable to maritime attack (the same might be said at an earlier stage of Batoum and Vladivostok), so would a naval base in the Persian Gulf be similarly treated. 6. Next, the argument under examination entirely ignores what will happen in the long years of peace, and assumes only what may happen on the rare occasion of war. It is easy to say that were Russia to acquire a Gulf port, and to create a mercantile navy and a fighting fleet, all three would be at our mercy, should war be declared. But supposing there were no war, what then ? In ten years of peace there would most unquestionably have been built up a position by land and sea which would be immune from any attack that we might direct against it: and we should no more direct our energies against Hussia in the Persian Gulf than, if war were declared to -morrow, we should try to bombard Cronstadt or to effect a landing at Vladivostok, 7. Thirdly, the familiar plea is urged that if only we were to come to terms with Russia about Persia—by which is meant the complete surrender to Russian aims—there would be an end to Anglo-Russian rivalry in Asia, and that the two nations might sit down too-ether to work out the reclamation of the East. I regret to confess that this plea appears to me equally untenable. The plan has been too often tried and found wanting. It used to be said that, if Russia were allowed her way at Constantinople, she would cease to be a menace to Great Britain in Central Asia. Will any one now contend that if Constantinople were given to her to-morrow, she would tear up her Kushk railway, or surrender her ambitions as regards Herat and Kasbgar? Only a few years ago the same plea was urged in China ,r Let Russia but have a port in ice-free waters, and we shall hear no more of Russian rivalry at Peking.' I doubt if any one who has passed through the recent Chinese war will now endorse that theory. The cession of Port Arthur to Russia was the infallible prelude to the absorption of Manchuria; and it renders absolutely inevitable the ultimate Russian control over the northern provinces and the capital. 8. As a student of Russian aspirations and methods for fifteen years, I assert with con fidence what I do not think that any one of her own statesmen would deny—that her ultimate ambition is the dominion of Asia. She conceives herself to be fitted for it by temperament by history, and by tradition. It is a proud and a not ignoble aim, and is well worthy of the supreme moral and material efforts of a vigorous nation. But it is not to be satisfied by piecemeal concession, neither is it capable of being gratified save at our expense. Acquies cence in the aims of Russia at Tehran and Meshed will not .save Seistan. Acquiescence in Seistan will not turn her eyes from the Gulf. Acquiescence in the Gulf will not prevent intrigue and trouble in Baluchistan. Acquiescence at Herat and in Afghan Turkistan will not secure Kabul. Acquiescence in the Pamirs will not save Kashgar. Acquiescence at Kashagar will not divert Russian eyes from Tibet. Each morsel but whets the appetite for more and inflames the passion for a pan-Asiatic dominion. If Russia is entitled to these ambitions, still more is Great Britain entitled, nay compelled, to defend that which she has won, and to resist the minor encroachments which are only a part of the larger plan. Like wk n P robIem ' 1 have often pondered at each stage from Korea to the Bosphorus, whether we could not, by a friendly agreement with Russia, arrive at such a demarcation of our respeehve interests as would enable us to eschew rivalry and I have found^thaT-n ^ 0peratIOn, if a( ? tUal al,ianCe, in the future - At each stage 1 have found that in such an agreement the giving would be all on our side and the receiving on the other. . he satisfaction of Russian interests could not be attained except uL's;fn 0 d wtv S e aC n r :t C h e ^ ^ 0Wn - ^ultaneously my inclinations have been met or have e ' Coura ,S ed ^ a stud y ° f tl&gt;e manner in which similar efforts ^o be for Great Britain nt w m h \ pa .

But it may be said, why not let Persia be swallowed up as the Central Asian Khanates have successively been? What is Persia to Great Britain or to India? A suffi cient answer might probably be found in the history of the past 100 years. It is inconceivable that a succession of Indian Governments and of British statesmen for a century can all have been sobliad as to have expended the efforts of a ceaseless diplomacy and millions of money upon an object which after all was of little value or concern. Even, however, if we brush aside this consensus of authority, and if we assume that Great Britain may in the past have ip placed her money on the wrong horse in Asia as well as in Europe, let us see what there is in the present situation to help us to an indipendent reply. ttaciHji,' . I2 ' The subject is two-fold—commercial and political. By the efforts of our tradeis Kussiaj; during the past century we have built up a commerce (in the main from India) with the ardCtcj; ports of the Persian Gulf and with the cities of Southern and Central and even of Northern Persia, which possesses an annual value of several millions sterling, it is not too much to say that we have created this market, and that in the southern zone we still monopolise it. The political absorption of Persia by Russia means the certain proscription and the ultimate extinction of this trade—at least in every article in which Russia can compete with India or Great Britain. Where now is the Indian or the British trade with Tiflis, Bokhara, and Samarkand? Persia would follow suit; and a system of carefully differentiated tariffs would, in a short time, deprive India of one of her best and most lucrative markets. 13. These considerations are sufficiently serious. The political ones are more so. The Russian railway to Kushk (where the materials are stored for the 70 miles prolongation to Herat) already places that fortress within the grasp of Russia, should she at any time care to run the risk of a casus belli with Great Britain. But the Russian railway about to be con structed to Meshed if prolonged, as is the intention, to Seistan, and ultimately to the Gulf, will dispense Russia from the necessity of crossing the Afghan frontier on the Herat side. From Persian territory she will menace the entire western flank of Afghanistan. She will command the Herat-Kandahar road and will render insecure any future British occupation of Kandahar. Lower down, in the unsettled tracts of Baluchistan and Makran, which we have at present only imprefectly brought under our control, there would be limitless scope for frontier disturbance and local intrigue. We should be compelled, at the cost of a great expenditure of money and of a serious addition to our responsibilities, to invest our authority over those regions with a more concrete character, and to maintain posts and garrisons to guard what would then have become a vulnerable, though it is now a negligeable, section of the Indian border. 14. The minute which I wrote on 4th September 1899, and sent home to the India Office with the Government of India's despatch of 21st September 1899, sufficiently indicated the extreme strategical importance to India of Seistan. The success that has attended the efforts which we have since made to develop the trade route from India to that part of Persia—the value of the trade having risen in two years from 71 to 15 lakhs—has tended to increase both our interest and our influence in that portion of the Shah's dominions, and has encouraged us to project the early construction of a railway from Quetta to Nushki, i e , over the first 90 miles of the route, A Russian railway through Seistan to the Gulf—followed as it must be by ihe political absorption of Seistan—would not merely kill this promising enter prise, and close the one remaining overland trade route (that to Yarkand and Kashgar is already nearly dead) that still remains open to Indian commerce, but it would have the following further and even more serious consequences. It would place Russia in control of a district ethnographically connected with Baluchistan, would profoundly affect our prestige both with Afghan and Baluch, and would greatly enhance the difficulties that we experience in managing the cognate tribes on the Indian side of the border. If Great Bntain is ever called upon to advance to Kandahar, as she will probably one day be compelled to do, an intolerable state of friction would arise between the Powers that would then control the upper and the lower waters of the Helmand. Moreover, while Seistan, if it ever fell under British influence, could, owing to the protecting floods upon the north, be easily defended agaist Russian attack from the direction of Meshed, our present frontier (should Seistan pass into the hands of Russia), being entirely exposed, would enjoy no similar immunity. I might easily enlarge at greater length upon the strategical importance to India of Seistan. But as I believe it to be now generally recognised both here and in England, it will be sufficient to say that a Russian railway through Eastern Persia to the Persian Gulf means neither more nor less than the final loss to Great Britain of Seistan ; and that the recent declarations of the British Government afe to our interests in that quarter forbid me to believe that they would acquiesce in any such calamity. For my own part, if Persia were to hypothecate to Russia the revenues of Seistan (a move whieh has recently been under contemplation, but which I should regard as not less insulting to ourselves than would be to Russia the hypothecation of the revenues of Meshed to Great Britain), or to cede to Russia a com manding political position on that section of the border, 1 should not hesitate to advise that the Persian Government be compelled to cancel the arrangement. Such a peril can.44 (/ however, be more opportunely averted by a plain declaration of our views and intentions in advance, than by threats or mil tary movements afterwards. 15. Should a Russian naval port be constructed in the Gulf and should a Russian fleet (most likely in connection with the French) be called into existence in the Indian Ocean, it is impossible, either for the protection of our trade or for the safety of our own shores that we could remain content with the existing strength of the East India squadron. We should have to place the ports on the eastern coasts of India in a state of more finished defence than is at present the case. Our military and naval responsibilities would be more than doubled in that direction. 16. The question would next arise how far Russia would find it compatible with her newly acquired political ascendency, that the main lines of telegraphic communication between Great Britain and India should run through Persian territory or beneath the waters of the Persian Gulf. Even if she were ready to leave them intact, should we be prepared to acquiesce in the control, at a time of emergency, of these lines by a foreign and probably a hostile power? 17. It has been argued that, if Russia cannot in prudence be allowed a port at the south-east end of the Persian Gulf, owing to its close proximity to Indian shores, and its patentcliallenge to Indian interests, we need entertain no such scruples about a port nearer to the upper end. As I have previously argued, a commercial port, as the terminus of a commercial railway, may be rendered equally innocuous anywhere in the Gulf. But if it is to be a political port, and the terminus of a political railway, then it is equally objectionable wherever it be placed, and the mere geographical distance of a few hundred miles or one or two days'steam, makes no difference in the situation. Political control over Southern Persia can equally be disseminated from lines terminating at Mohammerah, Bushire Bunder Abbas, or Chahbar. Whichever be the naval base, the ships that lie there can equally menace Indian commerce, Indian shipping, and Indian interests. Moreover, while at the near end of the Gulf, a Russian railway to the sea would have the drawbacks already mentioned of invading the British sphere of interest in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan, of destroying British influence in those regions and of directly menacing the British- protected territories of the Khan of Kalat—a Russian railway to the upper end, e.g., to Mohammerah on the Karun. would similarly traverse a region (that inhabited by the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes) in which British influence hcis hitherto remained uncontested, and where British enterprise has established an advenlurcus ^nd sucressful foothold, and would terminate in a port which is owned by an Arab Sheikh whose femily has been uniformly friendly to the British Power, and which commands the main channel of the Shat-el-Arab or combined estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates. To concede such a position to Russia would place the approach to Baghdad within her power, and would extinguish the influence of Great Britain in Turkish Arabia. 18. The international aspect of the acquisition by Russia of a port at either end of the Persian Gulf cannot be ignored. Such an accident could not possibly stand alone. Under instructions from the Home Government, we have recently submitted to them plans for counteraction in such a contingency, involving the seizure of certain Persian islands or harbours, in self-protection and retaliation, by ourselves. But neither would the action be confined to Russia and Great Britain. France and Germany would unquestionably appear upon the scene. The disastrous contagion of Kiao-chow would be reproduced ; and the Persian Gulf for 100 years, so far as political predominance is concerned, a British lake—would become a second Gulf of Pechili, to be quarrelled over and parcelled out by the greed of rival Powers. This is no fanciful picture of the imagination. It is an indisputable deduction from the circumstances of the case. 19. Finally, let me contemplate the effect that would be produced by the concession of a Persian railway and a Persian port to Russia upon the general problem of Indian defence. A glance at the map will show that India would then be surrounded in a rinc fence by Russian and her ally. Following this line from West to East I have already shown the position, o.t which Russia aims, as threatening the entire western borders of Baluchistan and Afghanistan from the Persian Gulf to Herat. Herat itself could be taken by the Russians in less than three weeks. From Herat to the Oxus, the Afghan frontier is at the mercy of the Russian forces. The course of the Oxus from Charjui to the Pamirs is now under their control. They can cross it at any point at any time without our know ledge and without the possibility of interruption. We are obliged even now to keep a close watch upon the northern passes of the Hindu Kush East of the Pamirs, the Russians have already taken up a position in the Taghdumbash-Pamir, which will presently make their frontier adjacent to our own on the Mustagh Range. The fall of Kashgar and . Turklstan 15 absolutely certain and cannot very much longer be delayed. Tibet will still intervene between Russian territory and our own on the north; but already rumours of a Russian Protectorate have been heard, and a mission from Lhasa has been receive y ^ e sar. On the extieme east of British territory in Burma, we encounter the rival ambuions and expanding influence of France, whose aspirations do not fall short of the complete absorption of the kingdom of Siam. It is far from improbable that within twenty, perhaps within twelve years from the present time, the metaphor employed will have been justified, and the Indian Empire, along the complete length of its land frontieis,45 will be coterminous with the territories, and confronted with the ambitions of Powers whose interest are on the whole inimical to its own. In such a case, and it is no idle dream of fancy, as the futurewill show, we shall not be able to move, to strike, to advance in any port of the world where French or Russian interests are involved, because of the menace that will stand perpetually at our Indian doors. Of the strain upon Indian finances, I do not at present speak: but it would be altogether in excess of our means. In this ringr fence there are at present three gaps: the still independent kingdom of Siam on the east, the portion of whose territories lying nearest to the Indian frontier has been guaranteed by a convention between Great Britain and France ; on the north the upland wilds of Tibet as yet impervious to alien intrusion ; and on the west the dominions of the Shah. These are the sole remaining buffers that separate the Asiatic possessions of Great Britain from her European rivals. It rests with British statesmanship to retain all three intact. But it will sacrifice the importance of their number if it knowingly concedes to Russia that gratification of her ambition in Eastern Persia, the consequences of which to the British Empire it has been the object of this Minute to expose. (iii) Important pronouncements and declarations of policy by the Marquess of Lansdowne, 1902-03. &lt; 154. The remarkable success which the manoeuvres of Russia in Persia had attained to in the year 1901, and which gave force to the insistent and vivifying influence of Lord Curzon 's advice, bore fruit in some important pronouncements of policy on the part of His Majesty 's Government. On the 6th of January 1902 Secret e., March 1902 Nos, 877 -521 (Nos. 50^,) Marquess of Lansdowne addressed to Sir A. Hardinge a comprehensive pro nouncement to be communicated to the Persian Government explaining our policy in regard to Persian affairs, which is quoted at length below : 1902 The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir A. Hardinge ,—No. a, dated the 6th January , ' The policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to the various Persian questions which most interest this country has from time to time been clearly indicated on the occasions when those questions have come under discussions. It may, however, be useful to recapitulate the salient features of that policy in statement, which you may at your discretion place before the Grand Vizier and other Ministers, ot tne Shah, or even before His Majesty himself, if a suitable opportunity should present itself. 'The Persian Government must be well aware, from the experience of 100 years, that Great Britain has no designs upon the sovereignty of the Shah or the indepedence' of his State It has, on the contrary, been one of our principal objects to encourage and strengthen the States lying outside the frontier of our Indian Empire, with the hope that we should find in them an intervening zone sufficient to prevent direct contact between the dominions of Great Britain and those of other great military powers. We could not, however, maintain this policy if in any particular instance we should find that one of these intervening States was being crushed out of national existence, and falling practically under the complete domination of another power. It would be necessary in that case, before the intervening State had virtually disappeared, to consider what alternative course our interests might demand now that the object to which our efforts had hitherto been directed was no longer attainable. 'Applying these principles to Persia, we have long recognized the superior interests of Russia in the northern portion of the Shah's dominions, which must naturally result from the long extent of her coterminous frontier. Whatever steps we may have taken to maintain our position in Northern Persia have therefore been taken as ^much in the interests of Persia herself and of her national independence as in our own, which are not directly threatened by Persian superiority in those regions, except in so far as it might affect the Persian capital and seat ot Government. In the south, on the other hand, for fully a century our efforts have been success fully devoted to building up a substantial and pre-eminent mercantile position, with the result that we have acquired an altogether exceptional interest in that part of Persia. ' Persia herself has benefitted immensely by these labours. We have cleared the waters adjoining her coasts of pirates, and have kept them constantly policed. It may be stated without exaggeration that the development of the whole southern trade of Persia is due to British enterprise, and that it is by this agency that Bushire and Bandar Abbas have been converted into flourishing ports. ' The system of telegraphs which has been introduced by the British Indian Telegraph Administration , with the permission and assistance of the Persian Government has tended, not merely to industrial and commercial progress, but also in a remarkable' degree to the consolidation of the Shah's authority over the centre and south of the country. C645FD46 I 'It cannot reasonably be supposed that Great Britain would abandon a position attained by so many years of constant effort, or would acquiesce in attempts on the part of other powers to acquire political predominance in the south of Persia. Although, therefore, His Majesty's Government have no desire to obstruct in any way the efforts of Russia to find a commercial entrance for her trade in the Persian Gulf, or to oppose any obstacle to the passage of her commerce from the north for export from Persian ports, they could not admit that such commercial facilities should form the pretext for the occupation by Russia of points possessing strategical importance or for the establishment of such an ascendancy in the south as she already enjoys in the north. 'The Persian Government should therefore distinctly understand and bear in mind that Great Britian could not consent to the acquisition by Russia of a military or naval station in the Persian Gulf, for the reason that such a station must be regarded as a challenge to Great Britain and a menace to her Indian Empire. ' If the Persian Government were at any time to make such a concession to Russia, it would be necessary for His Majesty's Government ^ to take in the Persian Gulf such measures as they might consider necessary for the protection of British interest: measures which in view of their naval strength in those waters would be attended with no serious difficulty. ' Nor, again, could His Majesty's Government acquiesce in the concession to Russia of any preferential political rights or advantages, or any commercial monopoly or exclusive privilege in the southern or south-eastern districts of Persia, including Seistan. British interests must inevitably suffer by such concessions, and the Persian Government have themselves recognized and acquiesced in this view on more than one occasion. They gave in October 1897 a written promise to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran that the customs of Southern Persia should never be placed under foreign control and supervision. When in 1900 the customs revenues were pledged as security for the loan obtained from the Russian Banque des Prets, a special exception was made of the revenues and ports of Southern Persia, and when Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires in April igoo called the attention of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the interest which the British Government had in the ports of Mohammerah, Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and othei ports of the Persian Gulf, and insisted on the right of Her Majesty's Government to be consist ed before any change was made in the administration of the customs at Mohammerah or in the position of the Sheikh, His Excellency replied that 'not only in Mohammerah, but in every part of Persia where British interests were concerned, the Persian Government, before taking any steps of importance, would consult the British Government.' His Majesty's Government have taken note of this assurance with satisfaction, and have only to add that a hypothecation, of the integral revenues of any of the southern or south eastern provinces of Persia as security for a foreign loan would be even more detrimental to Persian interests, and not less objectionable from a British point of view than that of the customs of the southern ports.' 155. The Shah's autograph reply, which was subsequently embodied as Secret e., July 1902, Nos. 344-306. Enclosure, an official document, contained a general Proceedings No. 279. assurance that his Government would never come to an understanding with any foreign power against Great Britain, did not intend alienatirig any portion of Persian territory to a foreign power for a military station, and would not pledge any of its internal revenues.' Copy of the above despatch was sent to the Government of India Secret e., May 1902, Ho. 7. wlth the Secretary of State's despatch . . . , . , y ^ S-- ecr et, dated 14th March 1902, with reference to their despatch No. 183, dated 7^ November 1901, as indicating the position taken up by His Majesty's Government. The Secretary of State at the same time observed^ 'Without entering into controversy or expressing my concurrence in all of the pro positions enunciated jn these papers, I have to assnre. Your Government that it is the earnest desire of His Majesty s Government to maintain alike the integrity of Persia, and the interests, political and commercial, which this country has claimed and supported by its continuous course of action in the past.' 11 j ,5 I' 0 ' l 7 th ( January 1902, in the House of Commons, Viscount Cranborne, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, said; ***♦**## affairtl h fYh^^rL Ch r n | ein r, theattit - ude ™ aint . ainedb - v . the British Government in the politicallv was rme nf U ' position in the Persian Gulf, both commercially and always considered^ that ch f r i cter ' and Hi s Majesty's Government had ascendancy of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf was the of fact Our trade inte ^J; T* ^ Tl ? a ( l uestion of ^eory, it was a statement ot tact.

(Extract from the Times of January 18th, 1902.)47 157- Again in the House of Commons on 22nd January 1902, Lord Cranborne said:— ******* * 'Our policy is the integrity of Persia. That unselfishness is not due to anv elaborate moral motive, because it is our interest that Persia should remain in its present territorial condition. But, when I state that I ought to add that there are limits to that policy, that policy cannot be pursued independently of the action of other powers We are anxious for the integrity of Persia, but we are anxious far more for the balance of power (hear, hear) ; and it would be impossible for us, whatever the cause, to abandon what we look upon as our rightful position in Persia. Especially is that true in regard to the Persian Gulf. as I had the honour to state to the House a few days ago. It is true not only of the Persian Gulf, but of the southern provinces of Persia, and those provinces which border on our Indian Empire. Our rights there, and our position of ascendancy, we cannot abandon. In the Gulf itself, as I ventured to state on the previous occasion, our ascendancy is not merely a question of theory, but a question of fact. Our position of ascendancy is assured by the existence of our maritime supremacy ; and I may say in answer to the remark of the hon. baronet that it is a far solider guarantee than any paper rights to which he pointed.' ******** 158. At an interview with the Shah in London on August 21st, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, in reply to a question from His Imperial Majesty, said:— ' that the recognition of the independence of Persia had always been a cardinal point Secret E., March 1903, Nos. 361-338. Proceed- in our policy. We adhered as strongly as ever ing No. »86. to that policy, which we had repeatedly affirmed. Our special concern was, of course, with the southern part of Persia and the Persian Gulf, and we should, if occasion arose, put forth the whole of our strength in order to prevent encroachments by other powers in these regions.' 159. On 5th May 1903 the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords made the following speech, dealing with British interests In the Persian Gulf {vide the Times of 6th May 1003) ;— ' I now pass to the closelv-connected subject of the Persian Gulf I feel sure that the noble lord's interest in the Baghdad railway scheme was because he felt it did closeiy affect our interest in the Persian Gulf. I do not yield to the noble lord in the interest which I take in the Persian Gulf, or in the feeling that this country stands with regard to the navigation of the Persian Gulf in a position different from that of any other power. The noble lord told your lordships with absolute truth it was owing to British enterprise, to the expen diture of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigra- tion of the world. It was our ships that cleared those waters of pirates; it was we who put down the slave trade; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those intricate waters. Well, at this moment, out of a total trade in the Gulf ports of ^3,600,000—the figures are those for 1901 ; we have none later—,£2,300 000 represents the commerce of this country ; so that it is clear that, up to the present at all events, we have succeeded m preserving a liberal share of that commerce. But there is no doubt that in the Gulf, as in other parts of Persia, we are feeling very keenly the competition of other powers. That, I am afraid, is our fate not only in Persian waters ; nor can we expect, because we have been in the development of commerce throughout the world the pioneers of that form of civilization, that we shall always be able to maintain the position of superiority which we at first enjoyed. The noble lord asked me for a statement of our policy with regard to the Persian Gulf. I think I can give him one in a few simple words. JLt seems to me that our policy should be directed, in the first place, to protect and promote British trade in those waters. In the next place, 1 do not think that he suggests, or that we should suggest, that those efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legitimate trade of other powers. (Hear, hear.) In the third place — I sr .y it without hesitation—we should regard the establishment of a vaval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. (Cheers.) I say that in no minato-'y spirit, because, so far as I am aware, no proposals are on foot for the establishment of a foreign naval base in the Persian Gulf. I at least have heard of none; and I cannot help thinking that the noble lord waxed almost unnecessarily warm at the idea of such a foreign intrusion, with which, so far as I am aware, we are not at present threatened. Well, the noble lord then touched upon a series of points connected with our commercial interests in the Gulf. 'I will take the navigation of the Karun river. That was opened in 1888. I was in India at the time, and I well remember the satisfaction with which Mr Drummond Wolff's achievement on that occasion in procuring the opening of the river to navigation was regarded both in India and at home. The trade of the Karun, although it has not increased perhaps as much as might have been anticipated, has increased considerably; and the lion's share of it is ours. I see that in 1897 the trade was only £26,000, whereas in 1900 it had risen to over £1 000,000. The noble lord .(Lamington) spoke of the difficulties encountered by our traders owing to the customs arrangements on the Karun. I do not know whether 1 quite followed what he said on the subject, but, I may tell your lordships, that the position is this. We were originally led by the Persian Government to expectthat three custom-houses would be maintained on the Karun, one at Mohammerah, the second at Ahwaz, and the third at Shuster. It appears that lately the Persian customs authorities determined to do away with inland custom-houses, and consequently two of these were threatened with suppression. Well, persons interested in foreign trade naturally protested. It was a great inconvenience to them that goods destined for one of the upper ports should have to be taken out of the ship's hold at Mohammerah and there examined. Representations were made to the Persian Government; and I am glad to say that the result has been that temporary arrangements have been made, or are about to be made, under which our traders will be given customs facilities at these three ports as was originally intended. - ' 160. This speech formed the subject of conversation between Lord Secret, joiy 1903, Nos 286-287, Proceeding Ltinsdownc and the Russian Ambassador No - 287 - _ _ in which the former again asserted the special interests of Great Britain in the Gulf, the south ports, and also in Seistan .*— The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir C. Scott. No. 112. Foreign Office, 6th May igoj. ' The Russian Ambassador observed to me to-day that he had read with interest the statement which I had made in the House of Lords last night on the subject of British interest in Persia. He saw nothing in that statement to which exception could be taken. His Excellency said that 1 had not mentioned Russia, although I probably had Russia in my miud: that power, however, had no idea of establishing a naval base in the Persian Gulf. ,r I replied that I was under the impression that my speech did not contain much that was new, and that I bad merely reaffirmed propositions which had on previous occasions been made or implied on behalf of the British Government. I had certainly never heard that Russia or any other power contemplated the acquisition of a naval base m the Gulf, but, as His Excellency was aware, there were many people who could not be persuaded that she had not such designs. ' His Excellency went on to say that, in his opinion, things were hardly ripe for a discussion between our two Governments as to affairs in Persia. It would be difficult to draw a hard-and-fast Hoe between British and Russian interests without raising questions which might give trouble. His instructions were to the effect that Russia accepted free commercial competition in Persia, and that was all. '' I realised the difficultr of laying down spheres of influence, but that I thought it would not be amiss that His Eicellency and I should, if not to-day, perhaps on srime Other occasion, consider whether it would not be possible to arrive at a'n understand- &amp; upon certain points concerning the policy of the two countries in Persia. 'l W V n i his C f U ^ try rec ^ nized the Preponderance of Russia in North Persia On the other hand, we had special interest in the Gulf, in the south ports, and a'so in Seistan lth re » ar d to the latter, I said that we should certainlv regard with serious aporehension thlhnT 91 0 f D i r part 0 u R o s 1 sia l t0 construct a railway from the north, so as to threaten the trontiers ot India on the Baluchistan side. /' His Excellency said that he fully understood our feelings on the enK^rfc n, ^ u would be glad to discuss the id with m'e unofficially XneveflUed 1 „ ll he expressed the opinion that it was iBcst unlikeir that ^way sSLe of^e kTnd wM^ I bad described would be undertaken by the Russian Government i6i.

I went on to say that whilst these were our feelings with regard to the commercial exits in the Gn\i, vt?. entertained the strongest objection to, and should certainly oppose, any attempt on the part of other Powers to create strategical bases or for tified har bours in those 'waters. The necessity for taking every precaution against such an event had been strikingly illustrated by the example of Batoum, with which His Excellency was, of course, perfectly familiar. His Excellency having referred to ourmefiance ' of Russia in those regions, I said that it had been my earnest wish to arrive at an amicable understanding with Russia in regard to Persian as well as Chinese affairs, and that I had made a ' tentative ' in that direction, but unfortunately without success. The above conversation, on both sides, was quite informal} but it is as well that I should report the substance of it to Your Excellency. C64SFD5° CHAPTER V. 1903. Lord Curzon's Tour in the Persian Gulf, November—December 162. One of the most important events in the history of the Persian Gulf during the last seven years has been Secret e ., February 1904, Nos. 33 -i07' the tour of Lord Curzon in those waters in November-December IQ03. The pur pose of the tour, as described in His Excellency the Viceroy's despatch , m No . 42 . N o . 148 Secret-External, dated the i 7 th September 1903, was (1) to inspect the establishments that are maintained in those parts, {2j to visit the Arab Sheikhs who are in treaty relation with the British Government and to testify to the paramount politcal and commercial ascendancy that is exercised by Great Britain in those waters. 163. Mr. Brodrick in conveying the formal sanction of His Majesty's Gov- lhidy No n8&lt; ernment to the proposed tour, observed that they had no doubt that the Viceroy's visit to the Persian Gulf was calculated to strengthen British interests in that quarter, at the same time attention was drawn to the disadvantages which mi^ht result from any impression that it indicated an intention on the part of the British Government to alter the status quo in the Gulf and at Maskat, as defined by international engagements, although His Excellency had assured the Secretary of State that in no part of the journey would any but conventional declarations or assuiances be required. His Excellency was warned that his position both at Maskat and Koweit would be one of special difficulty (despatch No. 34 Secret dated the 6th November 1903). ' 164. An account of the tour is given in Lord Curzon's despatch to the Ihid, No. 119. Secretary of State, No. 156, dated 17th 1-1 _ ti. t j i. 1 • ^ )ecei P^ er 'QOS? which is summarized below.

Here^t^PV a ? 1 ross to bandar Abbas, which was reached and was received on behalf of the Shahh^H^ff 61 ® fficiall y b y S5r A - Hardinge Governor of Gulf Ports The Aln ^ a t7 ^ xce ^ en cy the Salar-i-Moazzam, lhe Ala * ud *L ) owleh, Governor-General of Ears, was5 1 originally to have met His Excellency at Bandar Abbas, and in view of subse quent events, it is to be regretted that this part of the programme was departed from at the instance of the Persian Government. Courtesies were exchanged between the Salar-i-Moazzam and Lord Curzon. His Excellency also received an address from the Indian traders, his reply to which is printer below. Lord Curzon s speech pictures vividly the intimate connection that has always existed from the most ancient times between this coast of Iran and India and our large long-vested commercial interests on the Gulf:— ' Gentlemen^ in thanking you for your address, let me express my pleasure at meeting here a community of British Indian subjects of His Majesty the King Emperor enjoying the hospitality of a foreign and friendly land, and engaged in a trade which is equally beneficial to this country and to yourselves. I am glad that Persia returns the compliment by sending a large number of her own gifted and intelligent subjects to trade in the ports of British India; for these relations are merely the continuance in modern times of a connec tion between Iran and India that has lasted for centuries, and that is based not merely upon geographical proximity, but upon original affinities of civilisation, language, and race. Bandar Abbas, both under its present name and under its former title of Gombrun, has also been intimately bound up with the history of British mercantile enterprise in Persia and the Persian Gulf, and I suppose that there is hardly a scene in the world that has witnessed more struggles for commercial supremacy, or has experienced more startling vicissitudes of political fortune, than the waters and islands that we can see from this very spot. Should anyone enquire why the Viceroy of India, while in the discharge of the duties of his office, should visit this place, the answer may be found in the facts which I have already mentioned, namely, in the uninterrupted historical connection which has existed between this locality and India for hundreds of years, and in the residence here of a flourish ing colony of British Indian traders and trade. But the explanation goes much further than that; both in its local and in its general application ; for here we are at the mouth of a sea which has been one of the main and most beneficent areas of British exertion in the con tinent of Asia. The great maritime highway of the Persian Gulf has never failed to attract those nations who held, or aspired to hold, the ports of India; and having embarked upon the Indian enterprise in which they ultimately outdistanced all other competitors, it fell naturally to the British to pursue their successful activity in this direction, and thus gradu ally to acquire an ascendancy of trade and interest in the Persian Gulf which has never wavered until the present day, and which has been so far from selfish in its operation that it has brought wealth and security to the States and communities that are to be found upon these shores, has smoothed the path of every ship that navigates these waters and has won for us the friendship and gratitude of the principal Governments, such as that of His Majesty the Shah, with whom we have been brought in contact. The ascendancy of which I have spoken is demonstrated by the fact that out of a total value of trade in the Gulf—including under that designation the ports on the Arab as well as on the Persian coast, and embracing Mohammara in the latter, but not including Basra— amounting to nearly 6^ millions sterling in the last recorded year, 1901, close upon 5 millions of which was external trade, that is, trade with ports outside the Gulf, the British percentage of this external trade was 77, and the corresponding percentage of British steamers leaving and entering the Gulf ports was 97. If we restrict our observations to the Persian ports alone, we find that the total volume of trade in 1901 was close upon 4! millions sterling, of which ^ 4,232,000 was external, and that of the latter the British propor tion was 66 per cent., and of the shipping by which it was carried 97 per cent. These figures show that, even in the much more acute competition that now prevails, the commer cial superiority so long enjoyed by Great Britain in these seas still exists, if not unchal lenged, at least unimpaired. On the other hand there are circumstances in the trade and position of Bunder Abbas which shew that the keenest efforts will be required to retain for this port the advantages which it has hitherto enjoyed. You have called attention to other symptoms of Indian interest in Bundar Abbas. My Government is represented here by an officer, appointed for the first time since I came to India, to safeguard the interests of British Indian trade in this place, and I am glad to learn from you that his arrival has been followed by an extension in certain aspects of your business, and that you have already derived benefit from his labours. It is to be remem bered that Bunder Abbas though it has been shorn of much of its ancient fame, is the starting point from which almost immemorial caravan routes penetrate far into the interior, carrying what are for the most part British and Indian goods to the great towns of Central Persia on the north and west, and to the bazaars of Khorasan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia on the north-east and east. This is a very important outpost, therefore, of Indian trade. Again, let it be remembered that India is no remote country which is here busying itself at a great distance from its base. On the contrary, we are the nearest neighbours of Persia along her entire eastern frontier, firstly in the territories of Baluchistan, and52 next in those of the Afghan ruler, whose foreign relations are in our hands. Countries and powers which are thus placed in relation to each other can hardly fail to develop, and ought to encourage the closest connections j and the more that those who are responsible for their administration see of each other and learn of each other's views and needs, the better must it be for both. I think that I have said enough, therefore, to show that if it is a novel thing, it i s yet no unnatural thing, that the Viceroy of India should some here to pay you a visit, and to see how Indian interests and Indian subjects are faring in this allies and adjacent country. Perhaps in my own case the justification is not weakened by the fact that I have for many years taken a deep interest in Persia, and have always entertained the warmest desire that the ancient friendship between the British Government and the illustrious Sovereign of this country should be strengthened and deepened as time goes on. Gentlemen, I concur with you in thinking that it would be a great advantage to you to be connected by telegraph with the outer world; and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be instrumental, with the good offices of the Persian Government, in bringing about such a consummation. In conclusion let me offer you my best wishes for your continued and increasing pros perity in the future.' i6 - 8 While at Bandar Abbas His Excellency landed upon the islands of Hormuz and Kishm, and discussed with the Admiral the question of naval defence and strategy at the mouth of the Gulf. 169. After leaving Bandar Abbas the Hardinge skirted the southern shores of the island of Kishm and halted in the Straits at Henjam, in order to enable the Admiral and the Viceroy to form an opinion upon the question of re-opening the telegraph station at that place. They formed a very definite conclusion in its favour, in preference to Bassiduh or Bassidore at the western extremely of Kishm, where the British flag is kept flying and where a small Arab and Persian population has formed a colony under its protection. A visit was also paid to this place. The possession of this territory is invaluable because of the hold that it gives to us over Kishm : but owing to the tortuous and shallow nature of the channels, it does not seem likely that we shall again require to use it as a naval station, or that it could advantageously be turned into a naval base. While anchored off the neighbouring Persian Port of Lingah, the Viceroy enter tained the Salar-i-Mooazzam to a dinner on board the Hardifige, Nothing could exceed the cordiality of the relations that prevailed on the occasion. 169-A. From Lingah the Viceroy again crossed to the Arab Coast of the Gulf, where he spent two days in the harbour of Bahrein. The Chief of these islands, who has now ruled for a period of over 36 years, owes his position, his immunity from attack^ and from the warfare and bloodshed of earlier days, and the increasing prosperity of Bahrein (which appears to be capable of very considerable further development) exclusively to the British Protectorate. The atter as on many occasions been asserted by His Majesty's Government and a rrnts o no dispute. It is the main, if not the sole, guarantee for the commer cial expansion of which the place seems to be undoubtedly susceptible. It has een urt er emphasized in recent years by the recognition in 1899 by the Government of ndia with the sanction of the Secretary of State of the Shaikh's % eldest s on. Shaikh Hamed, as his successor designate to the Chiefship of the e ' , 0 , himself is of a conservative disposition, and he would gladly see no changes made in anything in his time, and be left to die in peace, in T^/^.Lord Curzon accorded to him. one or two local to thp r ^ ere 1SL ' ss f 1 J' pursuance of the authority more than once given Dressed nnnr.r' 1 ^ by - the Secretar y ^ State' His Excellency then If this Kp n f ,1 i' ' 1 an improwment in the administration of his customs, rassetf hv 3 ? before long, the State wou'd become seriously embar- Shafk'h that .) ► P e f rsonal '? deb ledness of its head.

While at Bahrein it was thought likely that the Viceroy might receive a visit from Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katar about whom there had been correspondence with the Secretary of State. The Shaikh, however, did not receive Colonel Kemball's invitation in time to attend. 169-C. On the 28th November, the squadron arrived at Koweit, and Lord Curzon spent two days at this interesting place. Shaikh Mubarak was unaffectedly flattered and rejoiced at the Viceroy's visit, and he exerted himself to receive His Excellency with all the limited resources of which his people and town were capable. Lord Curzon's entry into Koweit in a carriage with the 1,JC11[ andShaikh (the only vehicle in the place) surrounded by a galloping and shout- ^goesof i n &amp; cavalcade of Arab horsemen and coachmen, between lines of thousands of the inhabitants, and groups of women uttering shrill cries, was one of the most picturesque incidents of the tour. In his despatch of 6th November, Mr. Brodrick expressed the opinion that it was inevitable that the Shaikh should be anxious to receive from him assur ances of support in excess of those already given to him. Lord Curzon himself had entertained some such apprehension. But here, as at Maskat, His Excel lency found that the visit itself, quite apart from any fresh promises or engage ments, was regarded by the ruler as finally binding him to our cause, and as setting the seal upon the protection and overlordship of the British Power. The Viceroy was accordingly relieved from the position, anticipated by the Secretary of State as one of special difficulty, of either having to listen to embarrassing questions or to give embarrassing answers. It is true that in his private conver sation with the Viceroy the Shaikh, after stating explicitly that he had severed all connection with the Turks, and that he repudiated relations with any other Power than the British, asked that he mignt receive from us a title or decoration or an allowance. But these favours were evidently sought as ratification of a ^ rela tionship regarded by the Shaikh as already in existence rather than as the initial steps in a new and more defined regime : and they were merely the corollary of his action at the official reception at the previous day, when, upon receiving a sword at the Viceroy's hands as his Khi I at or gift, he asked for a belt with which to gird it on, as he had now become 'a military officer of the British Empire.' The Government of India instructed Colonel Kemball to report upon the exact nature and application of the Shaikh's requests : but the Shaikh was expressly warned that it might not be found possible to grant them, in accordance with a telegram received from the Secretary of State on the morning of the Viceroy's arrival at Koweit, the Shaikh was further warned against entanglements in the interior in which he could neither expect nor receive our support, and he promised implicit compliance with this advice. This, it was expected, would be the more easy if, as reported by him, the Wahhabi can didate for the Chiefship of Nejd, Abdur Rahman bin-Feysal, who is his ally, had been generally successful and had vanquished his opponent Ibn Rashid. It may be added that Shaikh Mubarak, though now an elderly man, is by far the most masculine and vigorous personality whom the Viceroy encountered in the Gulf. He seemed to possess a very acute intelligence, and a character which justified his general reputation for cunning, and explained the fratricidal steps by which be had attained to his present position. Wis protestations of loyalty and friendship were, however, in the Viceroy's opinion, sincere. He showed to the officers of all British ships, and to English travellers arriving at Koweit, exceptional hospitality and consideration. j «q. The question of the Baghdad Railway has called special attention in recent years to the ports or harbours of the upper end of the Persian Gulf, and t\ Lord Curzon accordingly utilised his visit to Koweit, to inspect these in company with the Admiral. W hile lyiriS Koweit an exainination was made of Kad* hama Bay to the west of the town. Leaving the fleet Their Excellencies then made a tour of two days in the Law piloted by Commander Kemp in the Sphtnx. in the course of which they fully explored Khor Ahdulla (the probable maritime terminus of a railway from Baghdad) up to the Turkish post recently planted at Um Kasr. Passing to the Persian shores o the Gulf, beyond the estuary of the Shat-el-Arab, similar exploration was then made of Khor C645FD than ^54 Musa, the considerable deep water inlet, leading to excellent and well protected anchorages, which might some day oe made the port of a railway descending from the interior of Persia to the sea. 171. The Viceroy and the squadron arrived at Bushire on the morning of the 2nd December. Extensive preparations had been made by the local author ities and by the British residents for a reception, but unfortunately the form of ceremonial originally arranged between the Persian Government and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran was subsequently modified by the former in certain particulars before the Viceroy's arrival at Bushire. The desire and intention expressed by His Majesty the Shah of showing courtesy and hospitality to the Viceroy was unhappily frustrated owing to the arrangements locally made, and ^ See Secret E-, February i9o4&gt; Nos. 128-144, His Excellency was unable to land.* On and Secret e. ( August 1904, Nos. 113 -143. the afternoon of the 3rd December, Lord Curzon received on board the Hardinge a large deputation of British subjects and residents in Bushire, who presented an address of welcome. The address referred to the increasing stress of foreign commercial competition which might have occasioned uneasiness, but for the separate commercial agreement recently concluded with Persia, and for the visit of the Commercial Mission. The acceleration of mails recently arranged by the Indian Government was thankfully acknowledged, but attention was drawn to the want of labour facilities the inadequate arrangements for landing and delivery of cargo, and the great necessity for the improvement of caravan communication with the interior. The dilatoriness of the Persian Courts was also mentioned. Lord Curzon's visit would be taken as a signal proof that His Excellency's interest in Persia remained unabated, and the mercantile community would be encouraged by it in their endeavours to maintain the precedence of British trade. 172. The Viceroy's reply is printed below : A Viceroy of India coming to Bushire in the year 1903, though he be the first occupant of that position to visit these waters during his term of office, is irresistibly reminded of his precursors a century gone by. He is, indeed, the logical as well as the histo rical successor of Sir John Malcolm, who came here more than once just a hundred years ago; and he is the latest link in an unbroken sequence of political officers wko have been deputed from India to represent British and Indian political interests, and to protect their correspending commercial interests in this neighbourhood since the appointment o the first Political Agent as far back as 1812 Even then British interests had been represented here for as much as half a contury; since it was in 1763 that the East India ompany first opened a factory at Bushire. At that time one vessel a year from India was sufficient to accommodate the whole of British trade. In 1902, 136 steamers entered this port, and of these 133 were British. In the last twenty years the imports have increased from 135 lakhs, of which 117^ lakhs were from Great Britain and India, to aoif lakhs in 1901 of which 152^ lakhs were British and Indian. In the same period the imports of tea from India have risen from a value of Rs. 65,000 to a value of close upon 10 lakhs. Ihese figures do not leave much doubt as to where the preponderance of trade lies. This history of 140 years is without a parallel in the connection of any other foreign nation with these coasts. Under it have grown up connections with the Local Govern ments and peoples of close friendship and confidence; it is a chapter of history upon which we have every right to look back with pride ; and it imposes upon us obligations which is impossible that we should overlook, and which no Government either of Great Britain or India, is likely to ignore.

This development is the more remarkable because, as you have pointed out, no one could contend that trade is conducted here under favourable conditions; on the conirary there are few, if any, of the conditions that naturally mark out a place as an emporium or channel of commerce. ******** Altogether, Gentlemen, I think it may be said that in Pushire you receive an amount of attention that is not always extended in similar measure to places so remote from head quarters, while the fact that a British Resident lives in your midst and is able personally to look after your concerns, which I am glad to learn from your address that he does entirely to your satisfaction, is a further guarantee for their protection. I hope that the position which British interests thus enjoy, and which is neither artificial in origin nor recent in growth, since it is the result of nearly a century and a half of patient and laborious effort both by Government and by private enterprise, may long be maintained, and that Bushire may continue in the future, as it has done in the past, to be the centre from which this benign and peaceful influence radiates throughout Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf.' &amp; 173. At Bushire Sir A. Hardinge parted company with Lord Curzon, and there the squadron dispersed. Leaving Bushire, the Hardinge carried back the Viceroy to the Indian waters, touching only at Jask for telegraphic messages and halting for a day at Pasni. Opportunity was taken to hold a darbar at the latter place of all the chiefs and Sardars of Western and Southern Baluchistan. The Hardinge arrived at Karachi on 7th December. 174. The question had been raised whether the Viceroy should make an attempt to see the Sheikh of Mohammarah. As, however, His Excellency did not propose to ascend the Shatt-al-Arab, as an invitation to the Sheikh to meet the Viceroy elsewhere than in his own territory might, in view of his peculiar and rather delicate relations with the Persian Government, have given offence to the latter, and as Sir A. Hardinge himself intended to visit him a little later, it seemed that the idea had better not be pursued. The Sheikh sent the Viceroy a very courteous letter by the hand of Major Burton, our Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, and to this His Excellency replied in a similar tone.S 6 CHAPTER VI. ~ , L- f , v,..cU in thp Persian Gulf. Question of control 6 ^nc?jurisdiction over the coast from Kbor Kalba on the Batinah coast to Tibbat near Khor-as-Shem.* (i) Movements of the Russian cruiser Gilyak in the Persian Gulf, 1900, 175 In February 1900, the Russian cruiser visited the Persain Gulf. She arrived at Aden about ist February. The captain told the Resident there that she was going to proceed to Far East via Colombo. But the Resident found soon afterwards from telegrams passing between the captain and the Russian Consul at Suez, that the Gilyak was to go to Bandar Abbas, and that the British Steamer Waddon to carry coal for her to Bandar Abbas (telegram from the Resident at Aden repeated on 7th February I goo by the Bombay Government to the Government of India). 176. On hearing this news, arrangements were made through the naval author ities that the British Government should be represented as strongly as possible in the Persian Gulf during the Russian visit and that wherever the Russian ship went, we should be present in superior force. The Pomone was ordered from Bushire to Bandar Abbas, the Lawrence was recalled from Shat-el-Arab to be ready at the Resident's disposal and the Sphinx was told off to Jask to keep up com munications. ill. The Gilyak arrived at Bandar Abbas on 14th February, and it was reported that its captain made overtures to the Persian Governor for a coaling station there, which request the latter declined to comply with in the absence of instructions from his Government. 178. On the 14th February the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy : — ' The Admiralty are being asked to instruct the Senior Naval Officer on the spot as f ollows If the Russians should appear to contemplate hoisting flag at Bandar Abbas or land a force there or attempt to occupy or control the port, he is to protest m manner indicated in his instructions ; then if in spite of such protest the Russian flag snould be hoisted at Bandar Abbas&gt; he is to hoist the British flag on Hormuz, or Henjam or Kishm, or whatever island is considered by naval authorities as offering the best advan tage for a naval base in that neighbourhood. Lord Salisbury particularly desires extreme precautions for secrecy and discreet execution of these instructions only under condition stated ? ' 179. On the 23rd February 1900, the Secretary of State telegraphed to the Viceroy in reply to telegram dated 17th February reporting about the overtures made by the captain of the Gilyak for a coaling station :— ' Muravieff positively declares that Russian Government has not the slightest desire or intention to acquire coaling on other stations on Persian Gulf, and commander of the Gilyak was distinctly ordered not to entertain any such idea.' 180. The Gilyak after this visited Basrah, Koweit, and Bushire, making as much display as possible of her broadsides and her equipment. She left Bushire for Colombo on 21st March. After her leaving Bandar Abbas, orders had been given that our ships should not follow her any longer, as that would cause much annoyance to the Russian Government. 181. In connection with the recent visit of the Gilyak to the Persian Gulf and her overtures for a coaling station in the Gulf, Her Majesty's Government ordered the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies station to arrange that captains of Her Majesty's ships visit the ports and islands and report on their harbour accommodation, capacity for defence and other natural suitability for coaling pui poses and for the control of the Gulf (Foreign Office to the India Office, dated 1 ith April 1900). . 1 * ^ s r ';g ar d s the , P r evi ous correspondence on the Mussandira peninsula, Khur Fakan, Fajeira, etc., see the Trucial Chiefs Preas, 1854—190$. r ' ' J57 * (ii) Question of control of the entrance of the Persian Gulf.

Referring to these letters the Secretary of State forwarded (Despatch No. 30-Secret, dated 23rd November 1900) to us copy of correspondence between the India Office, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty and pointed out that these reports showed that the most suitable places for a naval base in these waters were the islands of Henjam, Kishm and Hormuz, and that it might be advisable under certain conditions to occupy more than one of these islands. The Secretary of State therefore wished that further information should be collected regarding the climate, water-supply, etc., of these islands, and enquired what steps it would be desirable to take, in certain contingencies, with a view to preparing the way for further action, if the necessity arose. 183. The Political Resident, who was consulted, sent us a report by Lieutenant o . cm m . o / m « Hunt, who had been till lately Vice-Consul Secret E., May igoi, Nos. lo-l8 (No. 16). ^ r» i aii t- tt , r i at Bandar Abbas. Lieutenant Hunt found Kishm under the government of Sheikh Hassan, who was a Kalantar under the nominal control of the Naib Governor of Bandar Abbas. Henjam had for years been leased to Moin-ut-Tujjar. Its salt mines, from which some 5,000 to 7,000 tons of salt were then exported to Calcutta, provided the Sheikh of Kishm with a profit of rateable tax on these exports, no portion of which went to Moin-ut -Tujjar's agent, as it ought, unless the latter happened to be strong enough to enforce compliance. The island of Hormuz, like Henjam, Larak and Bostana, was leased to Moin-ut-Tujjar. 184. Tn forwarding these reports to the Secretary of State, the Government Secret E., May 1901, Nos. 10-18 (No. 18). of India observed (No. 66-Secret External, dated 2nd May 1901):— We are strongly of opinion that, in the event of the Russians occupying Bandar Ab bas or any other Persian harbour near the entrance of the Gulf, or acquiring political or naval privileges there, such as would constitute a violation of the understanding of 1834, our Naval Officer Commanding in the Gulf should have instructions at once to plant the British flags upon the three islands of Hormuz, Henjam and Kishm. We would occupy Hor muz, not with the idea of making it our principal naval station, but in order to prevent its being taken by Russia, and because its possession would give us command of Bandar Ab bas. Henjam and Kishm in our opinion must necessarily be taken together. The smaller island is required because the best available harbour in this part of the Gulf appears to be that which lies between it and Kishm, and Kishm is necessary to us because we already possess a plot of British territory upon it at Bassidore, and because it would be indispen sable as a base of supplies for Henjam. Your Lordship is aware of the conditions under which we hold possession of Bassidore. Though we no longer use the place as a coaling depot, we keep an Agent there, who flies the British flag, which seems for the present to be all that is required, as an assertion of our proprietary rights. There are no independent local chiefs or authorities in the islands with whom we could enter into relations. With the exception of the tract in our possession at Bassidore, the islands are under Persian authority, and since Lieutenant Hunt's visit, the Kalantar of Kishm, Sheikh Hasan, is said to have been superseded at the instance of the Director-General of Customs in Southern Persia by another official. nt. | - The harbour of Khor-ash-Shem or Elphinstone's Inlet upon the western side of the Musandim promontory possesses many advantages, but we consider it less suitable for our ulti mate naval station at the mouth of the Gulf, because of its distance from the main tract of steamers and from the Persian Coast, its total lack of supplies, and the uncivilised charac ter of the aboriginal inhabitants of Musandim. We should, however, see no objection, in the contingency contemplated, to the simultaneous hoisting of the British flag on the isthmus of Maklab, between Khor-ash-Shem and Ghubbeh Ghazireh, not necessarily with the view of ulterior occupation, but in order to anticipate seizure by any other power. The isthmus might, we think, be annexed without seeking permission either from the Sultan of Maskat or from the Arab tribes, in the same manner as it was occupied by the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1869. C64SFDS8 185. In reply to our Despatch No. 66 (Secret), dated 2nd May 1901, the Secretary of State wished to have more Secret e ., November 190., No 9 . 74-83. information about the Sheikh of Kishm's relations to the Persian Government, and the authority of Maskat over the isthmus of Maklab. v 186. Colonel Kemball reported that, while there was reason to believe that the office of Kalantar of Kishm was hereditary and might therefore be regarded as in some degrees free from Persian control, his position was not of sufficient practi cal independence to make an arrangement with him possible or politically advis able. 187. Colonel Kemball also expressed his inability to make any suggestions as to the meaisures of preparation which might quickly be taken in anticipation of the contingencies referred to in the Secretary of States' Despatch No. 30, dated 23rd November 1900. 188. Then as regards the Mussandim peninsula—at an interview which Cap* Captain Cox', letter No. 1S5. dated 23rd July t/', 11 C OX had With the Sultan of Maskat in 1901. July 1901, the latter informed him that the Secret E., November 190., Noa. n .S Z . chiet members of the commun i ty at Khor Fakan had several times made overtures to him, with a view to this port being •brought under Maskat jurisdiction. Captain Cox recorded the following land^ marks in history of this strip of the coast. 1808.—Seyyed Said-bin Sultan, Imam of Maskat, assisted by his uncle, Kais, besieged and reduced the port which the Joasmis had converted into a rendezvous and depdt in connection with their piratical enterprises in the Gulf. 1808 to 1832.—Khor Fakan ruled by the Joasmi chief, Sultan bin Sagar, in fief for the Imam of Maskat. Captain Brucks, R.N., in his ' Memoir of the Navigation of the Gulf ' issued in 1827, writes ' It belongs to the Imam of Maskat, whose nominal revenue from it is about 3,000 German crowns.'v 1832.—Sultan bin Sagar, taking advantage of the disturbed state of the Imam, Sand bin Sultan's affairs, assimilated Khor Fakan and other adjacent ports and held them for himself. 1850-1851. After 1832 the Imam and the Joasmi chief seem to have made up their differences, and the latter returned to his allegiance to Seyyed Said's successor, Seyyed Thoweyni (uncle of Seyyed Feysal), for it appears that in 1850, when Kais bin Azzan attacked and captured Khor Fakan from Sultan bin Sagar, the latter appealed to the Sultan of Maskat, Seyyed Thoweyni bin Said, for assistance. The Sultan, however, informed his vassal that he was too busily employed elsewhere to make any diversion in his favour, and that he. Sultan bin oagar, must manage the business himself. The Joasmi thereupon determined to a 7 u 5 . one ' an ^ was successful in recovering Khor Fakan from Kais. Although Seyyed Thoweyni's inability to come to the Joasmi's assistance in his hour ot need became the cause of temporary estrangement between them, they soon became reconciled, but Seyyed Thoweyni did not apparently trouble him- se f after this with the affairs of the northern Batineh ports, and from that period Sheikhs 6 ^ reSen ^ ^ ave rema ined under the domination of the Joasmi • Captain Cox thought, could not be expected to view with equanimity any attempt on the part of the Ruler of Maskat tore- !!'

In conclusion, if I may presume to do so, I would respectfully express the opinion that, as regards the Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets on either side of Maklab and the promon tory of Ras Musandim, the exercise of the Sultan of Maskat's authority over there is of such a conveniently uncertain character that it would seem possible for His Majesty's Gov ernment to treat the question of its existence according to the political exigencies of the moment. If we require a base there, it might be possible to explain to the Sultan that his claim to assert his authority there or power to make it effective is of such an unsubstantial nature that His Majesty's Governmentare unable to recognize it, but regard the Shihooh (including the Kumazereh) as independent tribes. 191. Colonel Kemball» in submitting Captain Cox's report, referred to the correspondence of 1864* and stated that • See Trudai chiefs Precis, 1854-1905. since then His Highness the Sultan had es tablished a Wali at Khasab situated on the Elphinstone Inlet, and further north the Sultan's authority with regard to Kumzar near Ras Mussandim was now apparently not contested by the Joasmi Chief, as pointed out by Captain Cox. It seemed to him, therefore, that from our point of view, as we are hardly likely to require Khor-ash-Shem as a naval base, it would be more convenient to recognise the tract as within the territories of the Sultan of Maskat. It would be perhaps advisable that the Slultan should be induced in the manner indicated by Captain Cox to make his influence more apparent in the locality in question. 192. Ihe Government of India asked for a further report from Captain Cox, after visiting the coast at an early date and ascertaining the actual political situation at the various places (No. 1863-E.A., dated 31st October 1901). 193. Captain Cox's further report No. 290, dated 2nd July 1902, and Colonel Kemball's views thereon (letter No. 15- Secret E, No.ember .902, No,. 7-«. s ^ 20th j uly , g02) are summed up and discussed in the despatch of the Government of India, No. 192, dated 23rd October 1902, and Lord Curzon's Minute accompanying it, which are printed below :— 'With reference to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship's Secret despatch No. 33, dated the 30th May 1902, on the subject of the selection of a naval base in the Persian Gulf, we have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship's consideration, copies of the papers noted in the enclosed list. . Your Lordship will recollect that in November last we invited attention to a sugges tion made by our local officers than the jurisdic- • Ftrfe our Secret despatch No. 180 (External), ^j on 0 f t j ie gultan of Maskat should be extended dated the 7th November 1901. an( j consolidated along the Batineh coast: and we intimated that, before expressing an opinion on this suggestion, we proposed to await a further report from our Political Agent at Maskat. The conclusions at which Major Cox has arrived, after a tour along the coast, are summarised in the 13th paragraph of his report No. 290, dated the 2nd July 1903, which forms the second enclosure to this despatch. 2. It will be observed that, as regards the Maklab isthmus and the promontory of Musandim, Major Cox is of opinion that the Sultan's jurisdiction is of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would be open to His Majesty's Government either to 1 i recognise or to ignore its existence, as might be found most convenient; and he suggests that, in view of the possibility of the Elphinstone Inlet being required for naval or strate gical purposes, the old telegraph quarters on the Inlet should now be re-occupied by the posting there a Native Agent in charge of a British flag, as at Bassidore. Major Cox proposes that to carry out this measure, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should visit the locality in the telegraph ship Patrick Stewart, without previous reference to the Sultan of Maskat, who could be informed, if necessary, that the step is necessitatedin connection with a contemplated extension of the Maskat-Jask cab.5 to Bonder Abbas, As an alternative to this proposal, Major Cox suggests that the Su tan should be pressed to assert his authority in that neighbourhood by appointing V\ alis at Dibba, Lima, Bokha and Kum2ar. Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball, on the other hand, considers that the inde* finite position of affairs on this strip of coast may safely be allowed to continue, and he proposes that matters should be left as they are. 3. The above proposals relate to the portion of the coast from Dibba round the Musandim promontory as far as Tibba on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. Apart from this, there is a strip of coast between Khor Kalba and Dibba which is subject to the influence of the Jowasmi Chief of Shargah, one of the Trucial Chiefs with whom, as Your Lordship is aware, agreements exist precluding them from ceding, selling, mortgaging or otherwise giving for occupation any part of their territories, save to the British Govern ment On this strip of coast affairs are at present in a somewhat unsettled state, the Sheikh of Fujeira, who is nominally subordinate to the Chief of Shargah, desiring to be come independent of his Chief, who appears to have shown himself unable or unwilling to accord adequate protection to his feudatory. Both the Sheikh of Fujeira and the Sbeikb of Khor Fakan have recently appealed to the Sultan of Maskat to take them under bis protection and to save them from Jowasmi oppression. Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball is endeavouring to effect a settlement between the Sheikh of Fujeira and the Chief of Shargah, and he considers that if the behaviour of the latter proves reasonable, we are bound to support him and to prevent the Fujeira Sheikh from asserting his independence. If, however, his endeavours to effect a settlement prove abortive Lieutenant-Colonel Kem ball thinks that it may be desirable to terminate the authority of the Jowasmi Chief on the Batineh coast, and to hand over the strip in question to the Sultan of Maskat. 4. The questions at issue, as stated in the foregoing paragraphs, are of no small difficulty, and have been fully discussed in the Minute by His Excellency the Viceroy which accompanies this despatch, and with which we desire to express our entire concurrence. The proposals which we would invite Your Lordship to approve are, first, that our Political Resident at Bushire should be authorised at a suitable opportunity to proceed to the Elphinstone Inlet on the isthmus of Maklab, and to effect a re-occupation of the old tele graph buildings there in the manner suggested by Major Cox; and, secondly, that the strip of coast between Khor Kalba and Dibba, which is under Jowasmi influence, should con tinue to be regarded as part of the territory of the Chief of Shargah, with whom we have treaty relations. It would be easy to explain the suggested action in the Elphinstone Inlet, cither to the ^Uitan of Maskat or to any other enquirer, as connected with possible develop ments of our system of telegraphic communications in the Gulf. 5- We trust that these proposals, which are directed to preventing the acquisition by any Foreign Power of a commanding position at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, will meet with the approval of His Majesty's Government.' MINUTE BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY. 'This is one of the most difficult questions with which I have been called upon to deal. The rival considerations, whether thev relate to the elucidation of political facts, or to the determination of a course of action based partly upon political, partlv upon strate- grcal, considerations are so evenly balanced that one may well hesitate to decide between them. Moreover, the political future, against which our action, whatever form it may take, is intended as a safeguard, is itself so shrouded in obscurity and so little admits of confident forecast, that it is exceedingly difficult to adjust the means that we are now called upon to adopt to the end that we have in view. That end may be described both in a negative and in a positive aspect. Negatively we des;re to exclude from the Musandim promontory in particular, and from the Batineh coast in general, the ships or forces of any foreign Power. Now the onlv foreicm Powers who require at present to be considered in such a context are France and'Russia.

If port or harbour is occupied for purely ourselves did in fh^rf^u 5, P 0 ' 1 '' 1 ,™«'d'ations arc waived. Thb is esactiy what we ei a \ e1 ' Requiring the place, solely for the above-Damed6i i reasons, we hastened to Germany (who had never consulted us about Kiao hau) Cand ) pledged ourselves not to push in to the interior nor to build a railway. It is clear therefore that isolated naval bases are not uncommonly acquired without reference to l land communications. Experience, however, shows, that the base once occupied, territorial acquisitions tends to follow. Thus the seizure of Aden has gradually been followed by the extension of a protectorate over the hinterland, that now stretches inland for a breadth of ^ go miles. Similarly the possession of Singapore has been followed not only by the absorp tion of the island but of all the adjacent States on the Malay Peninsula ; and the occupation of Hong-Kong has led to the gradual acquisition of a big slice of Kowloon. Should the French or the Russians therefore ever desire, on grounds of policy or strategy, to establish themselves on the Musandim Peninsula or in its neghbourhood, I do not think ^ that the remoteness or detachment of the situation would deter them from the step. Neither do I think that they would be deterred by the climate. Bunder Abbas is now represented as one of the most detestable places on the face of the globe. But that did not prevent Ormuz, which is separated from it onlv by a few miles, from becoming the seat of Portuguese sovereignty, and one of the greatest emporia of Asiatic trade. 4 Besides, the occupation of a naval base does not necessarily involve a large permanent European garrison, or colonisation on a large scale. Even if the occupation were tempo rary only, and were undertaken for the purposes of a particular campaign, with no inten- 2 tion of being ultimately persevered in, it might not, on that account, be less disagreeable or less dangerous to us. Supposing, therefore, that at a time of crisis France and Russia in combination, or either Power singly, contemplate seizing a harbour on that part of the Arabian coast, what is there (apart from the risk of hostilities with Great Britain) to deter them ? The ascedancy of Maskat over the littoral in question is so indeterminate that our own officer, Major Cox, advises us that we can either recognise or ignore it as we please. There is therefore no question of established or admitted right of sovereignty, to which we could appeal. Even if we ourselves were now to recognise the authority of the Sultan over those regions and to induce him to take steps to assert it, the French Government would not hold itself bound by our act. If it is open to Major Cox to urge the independence of Musandim, equally would it be open to the French. Their admission that the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 debars either Power from acquiring, either by lease or by cession, any part of Maskat territory, would not be held by them to apply to ports and harbours which they preferred to regard as independent. Indeed they would at once point to our own action in 1864 in establishing a telegraph station on the Maklab isthmus, without reference either to the Sultan of Maskat or to any other authority. Even if, in the interim, the Sultan had to some extent reasserted his power, they would still argue that this fell short of sovereignty, since the maximum assertion or that authority that Major Cox recommends or that the Sultan is at all likely to undertake is the planting in a few of the coast-ports of Walis (probably local men) who would in all probability be obliged to content themselves, as does the Wali at Khasab, with collecting such dues as would pay for their own maintenance without remitting anything in the form either of revenue or of tribute to Maskat. Still more certain is it that France would take this line in the event of seizure of a port or base by Russia. In no circumstances would she be likely to interpret the Anglo- French Declaration in a sense unfavourable to her ally. Indeed she might even, while admitting the restriction or disability imposed upon herself, decline absolutely to join hands with us in enforcing it against any third party. Next, if we turn to the positive aspect of the case—not only is it desirable that any foreign Power should be prevented from acquiring a base on the Musandim promontory, but, if Admiral Bosanquet's views are sound,, and if, as he says, that promontory is for naval purposes the most important strategical position in the Gulf, then it would appear to follow that, if we are to prevent our rivals from establishing themselves upon it, the only alternative is to anticipate them by anterior action ourselves. This brings me to the various recommendations put forward by our advisers. In the event of our deciding not to re-introduce the Sultan of Maskat upon the scene. Major Cox recommends that we should again plant a Native Agent at our old telegraph quarters near Khasab. Colonel Kemball, on the other hand, in what seems to me a somewhat hesitating letter, advises up to do nothing. If, he says, we re-occupy the Elphinstone Inlet, we may offend the Sultan. If we bring in the Sultan, then we shall debar ourselves in the future, and shall bring him into undesirable relations with the Trucial Chiefs. I may say a word about both alternatives. The risk of offending the Sultan is, in my opinion, infinitesimal, and is clearly disregarded by Major Cox, who is in a much better position to know what the mind of that potentate is. We have merely to point out to him. if be enquires, that the measure is one of precaution, directed against the chance of a move ment by some foreign Power which would be certain in the end to compromise his inde pendence, in order to remove any reasonable objections or suspicions on his part. The resumption of our position and rights at Maklab need not interfere with the limited amount of jurisdiction that his solitary Wali exercises in that neighbourhood, nor need it be C-645FD62 regarded as any more cxtraodinary than our corresponding pos tioa at Bassidore. Our rights at Bassidore, even though not actively exercised, will probably be sufficient to keep the Russians away from Kishm, unless of course they mean figh ing, an a similarly the re-insiitution of a'British post in the Elphinstone Inlet would operate as a deterrent, except at a similar risk, to any other Power, contemplating a landing in that neighbourhood. The weak point of Colonel Kemball's second atlernative is that, in attemoting to exclude others (as I have shown a probably quite illusory endeavour), we shall exclude ourselves. As for the Sultan being brought into contact with the Trucial Chiefs, since this state of affairs has already existed for more than half a century on the Batineh coast, without any detriment to cither party or to ourselves, it seems to me that it may be disregarded. The last sentence brings me to a parenthetical examination of the strip of coast bet ween Mureyr and Khor Fakan, which is under the direct control of descendants or depend ents of the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah. They fly his flag and they offer no recognition of any kind to Maskat. From Khor Fakan northwards to Dibba there is a further mari time belt, the Sharkiyeen inhabitants of which are under Jowasmi, as distinct from Maskat influence. Now it appears that in Colonel Ross' time we held this entire strip of coast from Mureyr to Dibba to be subject to the Maritime Truce—in other words, we recognised it as being a dependency of the Chief of Shargah. I cannot see why we should change this policy. We are much safer oS if we can reasonably apply to this maritime belt the conditions of the Maritime Truce, under which the Trucial Chiefs are prohibited from ced ing or selling any portion of their territory save to the British Government, than we should be if we persuaded the Sultan to establish his authority over it. For in that case the French would say that the Sultan's action was a belated political move instigated by us, which could not be allowed to supersede or cancel the presumption of the preceding half century ; and, as we ourselves should have thrown over the claims of the Jowasmi Sheikh, we could not afterwards appeal to them for protection. In our ingenious attempt then, to bring in the Sultan, and to shelter the entire Musandum peninsula under the provisions of the Anglo-French Declaration, we might find that we had overreached ourselves, and sacri ficed even the small positive amount of security that we now enjoy, I am inclined therefore to think that we should state the case as above to the Secre tary of State, and should tell him that in our opinion the balance of advantage is in favour of reasserting British claims to the Maklab isthmus rather than of advocating and emphasis ing the authority of Maskat We might take advantage of the opportunity to point out that there is no Sheikh of Musandim, as the Foreign Office suppose : although their argu ment that, supposing there to be such an individual, it is preferable to treat him as independ ent, rather than as subject to Maskat, is in principle identical with the view that we have espoused. ,, The 6tk October tgo2, ' CURZON. (iii) Political and Strategical valua of Kishm and Horrauz. Question of Telegraphic connection with Bassidore.—1902. 194. In his letter dated 14th February 1903, Rear-Adrairal Bosanquet drew stc-et e., may 1903, n&lt;», 1-6. attention to the strategical position of , Kishm, and the excellent protection afford- ed (better than any other anchorage on the Gulf except Koweit and Bas sidore) by the anchorage in Clarence Strait and off the town of Kishm. He observed:— ' The town of Kishm is the most favourable point for watchin? and controlling the traffic m arms which has been carried on by the Bandar Abbas caravans, being exactly opposite oandar Abbas and a better anchorage, its occupation would be a complete answer to any foreign design for the occupation of Bandar Abbas. ♦ * * H J' CO , n advantages of the respective anchoracres of!

In forwarding Admiral Bosanquet's report to the Secretary of State with Despatch No. 55, Secret External, dated 27th March 1902, the Government of India recurred to their recommendation made in their previous despatch No. 66, dated 2nd May 1901 (para. 184 above), that in certain eventualities the naval officer commanding in the Persian Gulf should have instructions to occupy the island of Kishm. They also recommended that as a measure of preparation a branch telegraph line should be laid at the cost of the Imperial Government to connect Bassidore with the submarine cable which passes to the southward of the island of Kishm. „ „ T , „ a 106. Lord Lansdowne expressed the Secret E., July 190a, Nos. 513-518. - „ y . . r /c , following opinion on this matter (r oreign Office to the India Office, dated 13th May 1902):— 'In February 1900* the Senior Naval Officer received instructions that if Russians •Para i 8 above should appear to contemplate hoisting their ' flag at Bandar Abbas or landing a force there, or should attempt to occupy or control that port, he was to make a formal protest^ and if in spite of that protest the Russian flag should be hoisted, he was to hoist British flag on Hormuz or Henjam or Kishm, or whatever island is considered by the Naval authorities as offering the best advantages for a naval base in that neighbourhood. It appears to Lord Lansdowne that these instructions are sufficient, or at all events that they require only some modification in points of detail. It is not desirable that the Senior Naval Officer should of his own initiative make protest, still less take action, except in case of actual territorial encroachments, and even in that case, unless the matter be clearly urgent, it would be better that he should, if possible, obtain instructions by telegraph.' Sir George Hamilton expressed concurrence in this opinion (despatch No. 33, Secret, dated 30th May 1902.) (iv) Re -occupation of the old telegraph buildings at Elphinstone inlet and erection of flagstaffs at certain points near Ras Mussandim. ^ ji 197. Reverting to correspondence about the proposed re-occupation of the Elphinstone inlet, ending with the Govern- Secret E., July 1903, Nos. 192-314 (No. 196), ment of India Despatch No. 1 92, dated 23rd October 1902 (see para. 139 above), the Secretary of State forwarded to them copy of correspondence between the India Office and Foreign Office, from which it appeared that His Majesty's Government regarded the moment as being inopportune for any exhibition of unusual activity in the Persian Gulf, in view of the then existing complication on the Aden frontier. But they agreed that steps might be taken, when an opportunity occurred of acting without attracting special attention, to reoccupy the old telegraph buildings at Elphinstone inlet. They also concurred in the proposal to regard the strip of coast between Khor Kalba and Dibba as part of the territory of the Sheikh of Shargah (Despatch No. 4 Secret, dated 27th February 1903). 198. Lord Curzon's cruise in the Persian Gulf in company with Rear Admiral Atkinson-VVilles in November and Dec- Secret E., June 1904, Nos. 300-483. ember 1903 was useful n focussing together much valuable information and discussing the suitability of the various harbours for the purpose of naval bases, coal depots, etc. A report was sub mitted by the Naval Commander-in-Chief to the Admiralty, No. 209-1171, dated December 1903, containing a descrip- ibid, No. 325. tion of the various places visited by Their Excellencies. 199. In their Despatch No. 16, Secret External, dated 21st January 190.1, the Government of India observed that the question of the position to be assumed by Great Britain at the entrance of the Persian Gulf either in the event of hostilities with a Foreign power, or—which is perhaps more important—with a view to pre venting the acquisition of coaling stations and harbours by such powers in time of peace,* 3 resolves itself into a decision as to the best stations to be occupied on the northern and southern sides of the entrance. Stations outside the Gulf or inside it at any distance from the mouth will not, in the Government of India's opinion, enable a fleet to operate with nearly so much rapidity or ad vantage ; while the configuration of the entrance, the two sides of which are rin siffht of one another, is such as to give a naval power, suitably established on either coast, a command of the interior waters so absolute as to enable it to dispense with stations further up the Gulf and to exercise a commanding control over the movements of a power possessing any such bases. _ For this purpose the anchorage at the eastern end of Ivishm^ Island, which is forrn6d by the islands of Kishm, Larak and Hormuz, being enclosed between them and the mainland, appeared to the Government of India to afford an almost ideal position on the northern side. On the opposite side the bays about the Mussandim promontory, Khor Kavi, Kubbat Ghazira (Malcolm's Inlet), and Khor-ash Shem (Elphinstone Inlet) afford very good anchorages. The naval Commander-in-Chief advocated establishing a lien as a coaling station on the anchorage of Khor Kavi. At the same time if would be desirable to take steps to prevent the occupation by Foreign powers of the two other Khors. These harbours are not required by us, because there are superior positions elsewhere, and because of their torrid and insupportable climate during summer. At the same, time it would be undesirable that any Foreign flag should be planted on either of them, or that any question save of British ownership should arise. To prevent such a contingency, the Government of India recommended that in pursuance of the permission received in Lord George Hamiltion's Despatch No. 4 Secret, dated 27th February 1903 (para. 197 above), the old Telegraph station on a small island on the Elphinstone Inlet should be occupied by erecting a flag staff, and also that flagstaffs should be planted on the Isthmus of Maklab, across which the old cable passed, and on Sheep Island on Khor Kavi. 200. The Government of India further pointed out in their despatch the desirability of placing a lighthouse on some suitable site at the extremity of the peninsula, both in the interests of navigation, which is compelled to avoid the neighbouring channels except by day-light, and in order still further to emphasise our hold over the Mussandim harbours and islands. This light might be placed either orrthe rocky point of Cape Mussandim or one of the three islands, called the Quoins, that are situated at a little distance from it in the open sea. The Government of India believed that, for nautical purposes, the latter might be slightly the superior position : but the political advantages of placing the light upon a point of the Mussandim Peninsula were deserving of serious consideration, and would probably incline them to select this locality. The matter was one upon which they wished to consult the authorities interested. In the event of a light house being built, the Government of India thought that the cost might properly be charged to Indian revenues. 201. The proposal of the Government of India about erecting flagstaffs on the Secret E., March 1905. Nos. 707-794 (No. 709). P^ ces mentioned was approved of by ... ^ ls Majesty's Government, on the under standing that care would betaken to erect them in the manner best calculated to avoid arousing undue attention (Secretary of State's telegram dated 24th ugust 1904). Hie Sphinx lelt on November 18th with Lieutenant Shakespear and returned on 24th, having erected flagstaffs on the positions in question. £0 hitch occurred whatever (Major Grey's telegram dated 24th November 1904). but the action was found open to the objection that it would not confer Secret e., August 1905, No». 388-307. upon us any special rights in the places 1 - -c 1 • e selected, unless it were accompanied by a specific proclamation of protectorate or annexation. On the other hand an pen assertion of our claims to these places might excite the jealousy of other of enauiri« mil'T po } ltlc . al ^plications. Moreover it was clear as a result we conl nL ^ I n' ^ (S ? e , hlS note dated 22nd MarcU '90S), 'hat of the Suhfn TlTf y Wlth h,St0nCaI 0ractual facts and 'ghts, ignore the fact t ' e bultan of Maskat s sovereignty over Mussandim. which the^-Itish t0 t h ese considerations and in view of the grounds upon Her Maiestv's Gov^nTT 6 ' 1 P rote / ted a g a i^ the cession of Binder Gisseh, w . ; L 111011 - preferred to rely on the declaration made by Lord base of'a foSd fort iTi^PerTJ GuifTy Jr ans fl downe „ 0 n 5th May 1903, and remove rnt«BsK r a p ^ wera ^ a M ryRrea . t3nenace toBritis h ; ^staffs from Sheep Island and the means at our dfspoia?

The views of the Government of India were invited on the question of Secret E., August 1905, No. 297. maintaining the flagstaff on Telegraph Island &gt; (Secretary of State's Despatch No. 16 Secret, ^ dated 19th May 1905). Major Cox, who was consulted, telegraphed on the 14th 1? July I 9 0 5) that Major Grey was of the opinion that, in the circumstances, there was no advantage in maintaining a flagstaff, and considered that it might be aban doned with the other two ; but that, if for any reason it was thought necessary to retain it, he could arrange it with the Sultan. It appeared to Major Cox that, if Henjam were turned into a sanitary station, Great Britain would want some other place at the entrance to the Persian Gulf for a war signal station, and Elphinstone Inlet might have been useful for the purpose, instead of Khor Kawi; but if the reoccupation of Telegraph Island would constitute a parallel to the Bundar Gisseh incident, he saw no alternative but to abandon the flagstaff for the present, and trust to seizing the locality when necessity for it actually arises. In his opinion, our claims to the island on telegraph grounds would be as good ten years hence as they are at the present moment. After considering the views of the local officers, the Secretary of State was informed by telegraph, on the 22nd July, that it was proposed to defer, until the declaration of the Maskat Arbitration Award, the actual removal of the staffs on the Isthmus and Sheep Islands. Their presence had hitherto attracted the notice neither of the French nor of the Sultan, and their removal now, or their consignment to the Sultan's care, might result in the Tribunal's attention being drawn to our previous action. There might be some advantage in the retention of the Telegraph Island flag staff, as evidence that our right to reoccupy was not affected by any assertion of the Sultan's sovereignty subsequent to original occupation. But the Gov ernment of India were of the opinion that the question might be discussed, after the declaration of the award, with the Sultan. There did not seem to be any parallel between the possible revival of the British claim to Telegraph Island and the Bundar Gisseh incident. The former would resemble the revival of the claim to the station of Henjam. 204. The Secretary of State telegraphed on 16th August that he had no _ ^ x, objection to the proposal made by the Gov- Secret E., January of 1906, Nos. 451-73. ■' , r t i- 1 r -11 11 ernment of India to defer until the declar ation of the Maskat Arbitration Award, the actual removal of the flagstaffs on the Isthmus and Sheep Islands, but that the question of the Telegraph Island would require further consideration before any communication is made to the Sultan. 205. When the Maskat Arbibration Award was given, the Director, Indo- European Telegraphs, Persian Gulf, was requested to arrange for the removal of the flagstaffs on the Maklab Isthmus and Sheep Island, by proceeding on the Patrick Stewart) without attracting notice, after consultation with the British Consul at Bandar Abbas, who, however, was not to be present. The latter reported on 26th October the removal of the flag staffs from the stations on the 18th idem. (v) The Fajeira Dispute. 206. It has been a part of our policy to regard the strip of the coast from Dibba to Khor Kalba as part of territory of the Joasmi chief. Recently, however, the Sheikh of Fajeira had been endeavouring to shake off the authority of the Joasmi chief. In his letter No. 158-A., dated 20th July 1902, Colonel. Kemball suggested that, in the event of the Chief of Shargah being unreasonable in the treatment of his feudatory, and being unable to give him adequate protection, it might become necessary to consider whether the Joasmi jurisdiction should not cease to exist on this coast and whether the strip should not be handed over to the Sultan of Maskat. We have seen what view was taken by the Government of India in their despatch* to the Secretary of State, No. 192, dated 23rd . October 1903. In a subsequent report Secret E..

In paragraph 5 ^ ! a iiuded to the dispute which was in progress be- ZZ^cLf of Shargah and the'headman of Fujeyrah I have now the honour to submit, te the information of the Government of India, a deta.led report regard,ng th.s d.spute, „ Tlip main features of the Fuieyrah question, as regards the history and political status'o^Fui^rah| were explained ii 'the letter No. 9?. dated the 2 6th May .88. from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of Indiau the Foreign Department. It will be seen that Colonel Ross stated the opinion that the Chief of Shargah is in his right in exacting sobmission and tribute m the strip of countr, referred to, that is to say, the Sea Coast of the Batineh m which Fujeyrah ,s s.tuated. In other words, the Sheikh of Fnjeyrahwas considered to be a feudatory of the Joasmi ruler of Shar- gah. -5 The Ion&lt;r standing quarrel between Shargah and Fujeyrah was settled in 1881, and the settlement was reported to the Government of India in Lieutenant-Colonel Ross s letter No. 204, dated the 14th October 1881. This settlement was brought about by the good offices of the Political Resident, the offered arbitration of the Chief of Ras-el Kheimah being taken as the basis of negotiations. It was not, however, in any way guaranteed by British authority, and a note to this effect was recorded at the time by Colonel Ross. 4. In 1883 Sheikh Sakar-bin-Khalid. the present Chief of Shargah, deposed his uncle Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan with whom the settlement referred to in the preceding paragraph was made. The agreement between Sheikh Salim and Hamid-bm-Abdulla of Fujeyrah did not long remain in force, and, in the year 1884. it appears that this same Hainid-bin- Abdulla, who, in his position as Sheikh of Fujeyrah, had made the arrangement in 1881 with Sheikh Salim-bin-Sultan, then Chief of Shargah, seized the forts of Gherefah and Bathna from Sheikh Salim's representative. Sheikh Salim appealed to the Resident, but Colonel Ross declined to discuss the matter with him, apparently on the grounds that the places concerned, Gherefah, Bathna and Fujeyrah, were dependencies of the Ruling Chief of Shargah and that Sheikh Salim having been ousted from the Chiefship of Shargah, had no further concern in affairs of the Batineh Coast. So far as I have been able to ascertain, though I do not find the facts officially recorded, Hamid-bin-Abdulla, the Sheikh ofFujeyrah, was actually persuaded by Shiekh Sakar to break the agreement of 1881, and he did so with the hope that Sheikh Sakar would make over the control of these two places, Bathna and Gherefah, to him. Bathna is, I understand, situated at the entrance of a narrow valley which is the only accessible land approach to Kalba and the adjoining villages including Fujeyrah, and since all hostile movements by sea are forbidden, Bathna became the key of the district, and the person in possession of it has practically that part of the Joasmi territory at his mercy. Hamid-bin Abdulla of Fujeyrah, with a view to maintain his hold on Bathna, entered into relations with the Chief of Ras-el-Kheimah, and Sheikh Sakar, wishing to avoid any disagreement with his relative, the Chief of Ras-el-Kheimah, did not take any steps to obtain control of Bathna. 5. In 1900, the Chief of Ras-el-Kheimah died and Sheikh Sakar assumed the Chiefship of Ras-el-Kheimah. The position of Hamid-bin-Abdulla of Fujeyrah consequently assumed an altered aspect, as he again become subject to the direct control of Sheikh Sakar. ihis apparently did not suit his policy, as he feared that he would lose his control over Bathna^ and he began to look about for a cause to throw off his allegiance to the Chief of Shargah. 6. The actual Joasmi representative, resident on the part of the coast line which in cludes Fujeyrah, is Hamid-bin-Majid-bin-Sultan, a cousin of Sheikh Sakar. He resides at Ghalat Kalbah, and the revenue which he draws from the places under his control, amounts, according to the information furnished to me by the Residency Agent at Shargah, to 2,000 dollars annually. The Sheikh of Fujeyrah, so I am informed, pays him an annual tribute of 150 skins of dates, about 12 cwt. of wheat and 10 dollars in cash. During the life-time of the late Sheikh of Ras-el-Kheimah, Hamid-bin-Majid, being on intimate terms with the Ras-el-Kheimah Chief, had no fear regarding the continuance of the tribute which was paid to him by Hamid-bin-Abdulla of Fujeyrah. On the death, however, of the Chief of Ras-el- Kheimah, Hamid-bin-Majid, being a Joasmi, could only look to Sheikh Sakar for assistance in time of trouble, and Sheikh Sakar, therefore, would naturally, on a convenient opportu nity occurring, have no option but to take Bathna at any rate, and, probably, also Gherefah, out of the hands of the Sheikh of Fujeyrah, so as to be in the position to succour Kalbeh should the Fujeyrah Sheikh march against it. The Fujeyrah Sheikh foresaw this, and he availed himself of a disagreement occurring between Shargah, Debai and Ajman, to find a pretext for severing his connection with Shargah while Bathna was still in his possession. 7. When I visited the Arab Coast in January 1902, I received the first intimation re« garcing the trouble which was brewing between Fujeyrah and Shargah. The Chief 0 Shargah, Sheikh Sakar, informed me that the Chief of Debaye was interfering in the affairs 01 the Sheikh of Fujeyrah. I directed the Residency Agent to write to the Chief 01f A miraltuti i inclurt 67 Debaj'e and tell him to refrain from interference in matters which concerned the Chief of Shargah and bis leudatory at Fujeyrah. The Chief of Debaye submitted the following explanation, that the Sheikh of Fujeyrah, being in trouble, had appealed to him for protec tion against the raids of Bedouins from which the Chief of Shargah was unable to protect him, that he, the Chiet of Debaye, asked Sheikh Sakar if he had any objection to his inter ference, and, no objection being made, he took the necessary steps to keep the Bedouins back and recovered from them the property which had been taken. Subsequently the Mazaria tribe, subject to the Chief of Shargah committed raids on some subjects of Fuje yrah. Communications again passed between the Chiefs of Shargah and Debaye, and it was agreed that hostilities were to cease pending a settlement of the dispute accoraingto Shera law. The Residency Agent at Shargah, in a letter to me, dated the 3rd February 1902, confirmed the explanation given by the Chief of Debaye, and further stated that, while the two Chiefs of Shargah and Debaye were in communication, the Mazaria again raided subjects of Fujeyrah and the Chief of Debaye demanded redress from the Chief of Shargah, who deputed his uncle Sheikh Salim, the ex-ruler of Shargah, to discuss the matter with the Chief of Debaye. It was then agreed that the two Chiefs should send agents to the parties who were at feud ordering them to suspend hostilities and inviting them to Debaye for the purpose of settling their disputes according to Shera. The invitation, however, does not appear to have been accepted. On receipt of the explanation gtven by the Chief of Debaye, I wrote to the Chief of Shargah informing him that the Chief of Debaye had, it seemed, only interfered in the interstsof peace, and I enjoined on him, his obligation to do justice and give protection to his feudatory at Fujevrah. I advised him to settle his diffi culties with the Chief of Debaye and the Sheikh of Fujeyrah in an amicable manner, and I informed him that he could count upon the good offices of the Residency Agent at Shargah in the matter. 8. Early in April, I received a report from the Agent at Shargah that the Chief of Shargah had collected a force of about 150 Bedouins with the intention of marching against Fujeyrah and other places in that neighbourhood, which had come to an agreement with the Sheikh of Fujeyrah and had renounced the authority of the Joasmis. The Chiefs of Debaye and Aj man were determined to oppose this movement on the part of the Shargah Chief who had therefore sent a messenger to the Chief of Abu Dhabi for the purpose, it appears, of entring into an alliance with that Chief. The Chiefs of Shargah and Abu Dhabi had been on bad terms for some years past, but the Shargah messenger succeeded in bringing about a friendly understanding between them. The Chief of Shargah agreed to remove his objection to the settlement, by the Chief f Abu Dhabi, of the Sudan tribe at Zaora, and an offensive and defensive alliance between Shargah and Abu Dhabi was entered into. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi then sent his son to endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the Chief of Shargah and the Chiefs of Ajman, Debaye, and Um-el-Kowein but without success. g. Soon after this Major Cox, Political Agent at Maskat, visited me at Bushire,and informed me that Hamad-bin-Abdulla of Fujeyrah was at Maskat and had asked the Sultan to help him and to appoint a Wali at Fujeyrah. The Sultan, so Major Cox said, was apparently under the impression that Fujeyrah was independent. I accordingly wrote to His Highness the Sultan on the subject, and copies of my letter and of the Sultan's reply _ , .. , „ are herewith forwarded for the information of Enclosures N oj» 1 and 3. ^ uovernment. lo. As Major Cox intended to visit the Batineh Coast in H. M. S. Redbreast, I asked him to call in at Fujeyrah. A copy of Major Enclosure No. 3. Cox's report to me regarding his visit to Fujeyrah is herewith forwarded. Meanwhile, shortly after my arrival at Shiraz, I received informa tion from Bushire, which led me to think that the alliance which had been entered into between Shargah and Abu Dhabi, consequent on the removal of the former's objection with regard to Zaora, might be the cause of trouble on the Arab Coast. 1 consequently sent the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to visit the Arab i^oast and to report on the state of affairs Mr. Gaskin visited the Arba Coast, in the end of May, and in his report to me, dated the 2nd June, he informed me that the Chief of Shragah had entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with the Chief of Abu Dhabi, and had consequently remorved his obiection regarding Zaora. It was evident, however, that the Shargah Chief was well aware of and. indeed, counted upon the fact that the settlement of Zaora by the Abu Dhabi Chief would not be allowed by the Political Resident. With regard to Fujeyrah, the Chief of Shargah explained that he had done all in his power to conciliate the Sheikh, and had done his best to recover the property raided by Bedouins from Fujeyrah people, but his control over the Bedouins was weak. He said that the Joasmi Sheikhs greatly resented the Deoaye Chief's interference in the matter, and that the action of the Chief of Debaye in attempting to crain influence over Sheikhs subordinate of Shargah was a serious menace to him and mieht result in his deposal from his position of Chief of Shargah. He was, he said, quite willing to meet the Sheikh of Fujeyrah in a friendly spirit and overlook his recent behaviour . Mr Gaskin then proceeded to Debaye and told the Chief that it was my wish that he should cease to interfere in the affairs of Fujeyrah. The Chief explained that he had only acted in accordance with Arab usage, and that it would be difficult for him to withdraw now as he would thereby lose the confidence of the Arabs. He. however, gave Mr. Gaskin a letter to me in which he agreed to follow my advice and to abstain from interference in Fujeyrah matters, but asked me to induce the Chief of Shargah to arrange a settlement of tae Fujeyrah Sheikh's claims. t68 n On receipt of Mr. Gaskin 's report, I directed the Residency Agent to use his good offices to brine about a setlement of the dispute between Fujeyrah and Shargah. It was not entirely clear what grievances the Sheikh of Fujeyrah had against the Chief of Shargah, and it was important that these should be ascertained. It would be better, therefore, that a Majlis should be held and the case fully heard. I instructed the Residency Agent to obtain a safe conduct from the Chief of Shargah in behalf of the Sheikh of Fujeyrah, and also an agreement from the Chief of Shargah that he would abide by my decision after the full facts of the case had been elicited and the recommendations of the Majlis and been submit ted to me. The Chief readily gave the safe conduct and agreement alluded to. The Agent then wrote to the Sheikh of Fnjeyrah, and asked him to come to Shargah, so that his case might be enquired into and a settlement arrived at. The Sheikh, however, declined to come, and it was evident from his replies that he bad no intention of coming to any agreement with the Chief of Shargah. The Agent reported that the reason for his refusal to come to terms was that he had received assurance of assistance from the Sultan s Wali at Sohar and the Shihoohs residing at Baiya who are subject to Maskat. 12. Early in October, I received a report from the Residency Agent that a certain headman of the Shihooh, or Shahieen, was giving overt support to the Sheikh of Fujeyrah. , o I accordingly addressed the Political Agent. Enclosures Nos.4to8. * - , . u- ». n • r i ^ 5 . Maskatj on the subject. Copies of my letter with enclosure to the Political Agent and of the latter's reply are herewith forwarded. 13. In the month of November, I visited the Arab Coast. At Debaye, which was the first*place visited, I learat that the Chief of Shargah had, a short time previously, been responsible for the murder of two people from Fujeyrah, men of some position in their country, who had been on a visit to Ajman and were on their way back to Fujeyrah. The Chief of Shargah, having heard that these two men were leaving Ajman for Fujeyrah, sent after them and had them killed. When I visited Shargah, I questioned the Chief on the subject., and he informed me that the information was correct, and he justified his action as being a reprisal for similar outrages on his subjects by people of Fujeyrah. I remonstrated with the Chief and told him that, in my opinion, he had acted very wrongly, and that such action on his part must; necessarily make a settlement of the Fujeyrah question more difficult. The Chief, who appeard to be in a very anxious state of mind, appealed to me to assist him to arrange matters with Fujeyrah. I told him that I had done all that I considered 1 was in any way called upon to do, on his behalf. I had directed the Chief of Debaye to refrain from interference in the matter, and I had also communicated with His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, whose letters to Zed-el-Helali and other Shihoohs I showed to the Chief, and then delivered to the Residency Agent to be forwarded to their destination. After further conversation, I agreed to do what I could in order to bring about a settlement between the Chief and the Fujeyrah Sheikh, but I told the Chief that he must put a stop to further murderous outrages on the part of his subjects. The Chief promised that he would order his dependents to observe a truce for the present and I directed the Agent to write to Fujey rah and tell the Sheikh to do the same. I then proceeded to Ajman and Um-el-Kowein, where I learned that an expedition was on the point of starting against Ras-el-Kheimah. It appeared that the Chief of Um-el-Kowein had a grievance against Ras-el-Kheimah, and not being able to get satisfaction from the Chief of Shargah, who is also ruler of Ras-el- Kheimah, had determined to march against Ras«el-Kheimah. I succeeded in inducing the Chief of Um-el-Kowein, to postpone hostilities, and I told the Residency Agent to inform he Chief of Shargah that he should arrange at once to satisfy the Chief of Um-el-Kowein, those complaint again st Ras-el-Kheimah appeared to be just, and meanwhile to holdback the letters from the Sultan of Maskat to the Shihoohs of the Batineh. 14. Towards the end of December, I directed the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to proceed to Fujeyrah in the Lawrence taking the Chief of Shargah and the Residency Agent with him, as I hoped that, if a meeting between Sheikh Sakarand the Chief of Fujeyrah could be ananged, a mode of settlement of the trouble could be brought about. I regret, however, to have to report that this final endeavour to settle the matter has not been successful. A copy of the report submitted by the Assistant Political Agent is herewith forwarded. From it, it will be seen that the Sheikh of Fujeyrah was not willing to listen to any reasonable Enclosure No. q. proposals. The probability is that Sheikh Sakar , ' has given the Sheikh of Fujeyrah just cause for grievance, and there is little doubt that there is right and wrong on both sides. It is evident, however, that the Sheikh of Fujeyrah, by his unreasonable attitude on the occasion o m) rst em eayour to bring about a settlement [vide paragraph 11 of this letter), and also on the occasion of Mr, Gaskin's visit in the Lawrence, had fully made up his mind to end- eavour to sever his connection with the Shargah Chief. In paragraphs 5 and 6 above, I have alluaed to the reasons for this determination on the Chief's part. The matter now stands, si have reported, and the Chief of Shargah has been informed by me that I regretted fnl esvours o ring about a pea.ceable solution of the dispute have been unsuccess- but thai-r ITvi a 1 ert y to ^ wn measures to bring his feudatory to reason, Sakar will h 0 ' 6 m ° vement sea ^ or this purpose would be permitted. Whether Sheikh ^om himiel^tK^c 688 i^^ n r ot 11 remains . to be^ seen. He has succeded in alienating of the Chief of Ah''nT k * 68 u ^ ^ ^' e ^ s on ^ Arab Coast, with the exception, perhaps not likdv to^em^K ' ^wever, from what he told me when I met him recently, is ably therefore ha i* nof 18 ® . or the purpose of coercing the Shiekh of Fujevrah,, prob ably therefore he ,s not in a position, at any rate at presenl, to take any active step a g ai 0 stX % 'CIJ.. iMi •lio0 69 Fujeyrah but it is not at all likely (hat he will desist from his endeavours to reduce the She'kh of that place to submission. Shiekh bakar himself gets no revenue from the Batineh^ but as Chief of the Joasmi tribe^ it is of great importance to his prestige to maintain his supremacy in that part. From our point of view, it does not seem to me that it is of much importance whether the Shiekh of Fujeyrah succeeds in throwing off his allegiance to the Chief of Shargah, or whether the latter succeeds in reducing Fujeyrah to subjection. In the inter est of peace, I considered it advisable to endeavour to bring about an amicable settlement between the parties, and also, as it had already been decided that the Joasmi ruler had certain rights over Fujeyrah, to discourage the interference of outside parties in a matter which concerned the Chief of Shargah and his feudatory. General sympathy appears to be with the Sheikh of Fujeyrah, but it does not follow from this that the Sheikh has right on his side but rather it appears to be due the general dislike to the Joasmis and to the present Chief of Shargah in particular. Nothing more can be done at present, and it only remains to watch the progress of the quarrel. 15. I have thought it as well to report at length on this matter, as the question of the extinction of Joasmi influence on this part of the Batineh Coast may be under consideration. The Political Agent at Maskat, in paragraph 14 of hia letter No. 290, dated the 2nd July 1902, threw out the suggestion that the Sultan of Maskat might be permitted to resume jurisdiction over that part of theC^ast now dominated by the Joasmis. The result, however, of my enquiries leads me to think that such an arrangement would not be practicable. The detachment of the Joasmis on the Batineh Coast from the overlordship of the Shargah Chief would practically mean the division of the Joasmis, and would, I feel sure, not be agreed to by the Chief of Shargah and the other Joasmis, Neither do I think that at present, a* any rate, we could countenance such a proposal, as, thereby, distrust in our good faith might be created. The break in the continuity of Maskat rule, owing to this strip of the Batineh Coast being subject to Joasmi sway, is, I admit, to a certain extent, inconvenient, and, moreover, it certainly appears that the Joasmi rule is ineffective, whereas the Sultan of Maskat would probably maintain better order in the region. On the other hand, the district is of no particular importance, and it cannot be said that much inconvenience has resulted owing to the weakness of the Joasmi rule, neither do I think that much credit need be given to the stories of Joasmi oppression. Since the date of the settlement between Sheikh Salim and the Sheikh of Fujeyrah, little has been heard of this part of the world, and since the year 1884 when Sheikh Salem apparently abandoned all hopes of recovering his power, I can find hardly any mention of Fujeyrah in the records of this Residency. The Fujeyrah Sheikh who, even in 1881, was considered to be somewhat of a turbulent character, had matters, it would seem, his own way, and it was only owing to the altered condition of affairs consquent on the death of the Chief of Ras-el-Kheimah that the question has again been brought into prominence. The Chief of Shargah has I think, a right to expect that outside influence should not be brought to bear to encourage the Sheikh of Fujeyrah in his defiant attitude, and this, as I have stated above, I have endeavoured to ensure. Later on, if only the Sheikh of Fujeyrah can be made to see that he cannot expect assistance from Maskat or Debaye, it may be possible to effect a settlement. 207. The Government of India expressed the following views in the matter (No. 821-E., dated 31st April 1903):— « The Government of India entirely accept your later view that no interference by Sultan of Maskat should be allowed in this tract, which has long been regarded as subordinate to the Jowasmi Chiefs. From the accompanying copies of correspondence it will be seen that this view has been accepted by His Majesty's Secretary of State. The Govern ment of India trust that your good offices may be able to effect a settlement which will be satisfactory to both parties, but they have no wish to interfere authoritatively in the internal disputes of these parts, provided that it is _ . , j- . clearly understood that, as held by them so far back as .88., the portion of the coast of Oman in the Persian Oulf, No. 149, dated the aist July between Dibba and Khor Kalba is subject to the 1881. maritime truce, and that the'Sheikh in power is bound by the terms of the agreements entered into from time to time with the British Government.'' 208. In June 1903, it was reported that the chief of Shargah and Ras-ul- Khima has marched against the headman of Fajeira. After some opposition, in which he was assisted by some Shihiyins of Beya, the Shiekh was obliged to sue for peace and on his admitting himself to be a vassal of the Joasmi chief, a provisional agreement was made between the parties. In the Gulf Administra tion Report for 1903-04 it was stated that the terms of this arrangement have not, however, been fulfilled and the matter is still under consideration.' , the Despatch from the Government of India, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, No. 192, dated the a3fd October 190a.

In submitting these reports to the Secretary of State, the Government of India (Despatch No, 54, Secret—External, dated 3rd May 1900), expressed the opinion that time had arrived when the provision for telegraphic communication both with Maskat and Bandar Abbas had become of importance. 210. The schemes which had been suggested were that the existing cable from Karachi to Jask should be diverted and taken from Karachi to Maskat and thence to Jask, or that a second cable should be laid between Karachi and Jask, touching at Maskat; and, in either case, that one of the existing cabJes between Jask and Bushire should be looped into Bandar Abbas, or the land-line extended to that place from Jask. 211. The Secretary of State in reply forwarded with his Despatch No. 97, dated External a ., Februarj .90., No.. 3,-39, 6 ' h ^ e P t . emb ' 1 9°°, correspondence with the Jhoreign Office, which showed that the project was generally approved by Her Majesty's Government, but asked the views of the Government of India on two suggestions, ist that a cable between Jask and Bandar Abbas, or at all events a temporary connection with the latter by means of T-pieces would be preferable to a land line, and, secondly, that the whole scheme should be postponed to a more favourable mo ment. 1 he Secretary of State subsequently telegraphed on 24th October enquir® ing whether provision for the supply of cables should be made in the Budget of 1901-02 and the Viceroy replied on 18th November that, on the understanding that Her Majesty s Government would consent to bear half the cost, provision might be made for a cable to Maskat and for a cable or land line from Bandar Abbas to Jask. 212. The Government of India replied to the Secretary of State's Despatch No. 97, dated 6th September, as follows (No. 20-External, dated 31st January 1901):— ♦I,. ''^® arest [ on g 1 yj n u favo i u . r of early action, and we gather from Sir A. Godley's letter of the 18th December last that thi s v'ew is shared by Your Lordship.

A con venient way of settling the question of a cable to Bandar Abbas occurred to the Government of India, that is by re-establishment of our telegraph station at Hen- jam by which we could easily connect Bandar Abbas with the Persian Gulf tele graphs. The proposal was explained in the following despatch (No. 56, Secret- External, dated 7th May 1903) to the Secretary of State ' We have the honour to invite Your Lordship's attention to the correspondence ending with the Viceroys telegram, dated the 20th March 1901, regarding a proposal for the connection of Bandar Abbas with the Indo-European telegraph system. The reasons which at that time led His Majesty's Government to consider the opportunity unfavourable for the execution of the project have since passed away, and we now again desire^ to put forward the scheme, modified in certain respects as the result of further investigation of the entire question of telegraphic communication in the Persian Gulf. 2. Your Lordship is doubtless aware that, previous to 1881, one of the telegraph cables which now pass through the Straits of Ormuz to the south of Henjam, lay in the channel to the north of that island, on which, from 1869 to 1881, there was a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The idea having occurred to us that the re-establishment of this post might provide the easiest means of connecting Bandar Abbas with the telegraph system, we ascertained from the Director of the Persian Gulf Telegraphs that either of the cables could again be landed on the island without difficulty, and we subsequently asked him to furnish an estimate of the cost of such diversion, and of a connection from Henjam to Bandar Abbas. A copy of our letter and of his reply are enclosed with this despatch. It will be seen that four varying estimates of cost are given— (1) Taking (a) the larger estimate for the diversion to Henjam, and (3) connection between Henjam and Bandar Abbas by cable all the way ... ... Rs. 2,78,096, or ^18,539 (a)/ Taking (a) the smaller estimate for the diversion to Henjam, and {b) connection between Henjam, and Bandar Abbas, as in (i), I.*., by cable only ... ... Ra. 2,29,7961 or ^15,319 (3) Taking (a) the larger estimate for the diversion to Henjam, and (3) connection beteen Henjam and Bandar Abbas partly by sea and partly by land across Kishm ... Rs. 2,25,830 or ^15,055 (4) Taking (a) the smaller estimate for the diversion to Henjam, and (3) connection between Henjam and Bandar Abbas as in (3), f.tf., partly by sea and partly by land ... ... ... Rs. *»77 i 530| o«* j£ '1835 As regards the alternative means of connecting Henjam and Bandar Abbas, we incline to the overland line via Kishm. We do not anticipate any risk of interruption on the sparsely inhabited island of Kishm : and we think that any steps will be of value that may tend to strengthen our influence in that island, where we already possess the station of Bassidore, which might also, if necessary, be similarly connected with the station at Henjana. If, however, His Majesty's Government entertain a strong preference for a cable, we have no wish to press the point, and consider that the small increase in cost is immaterial; 3. It will be seen that in its initial cost the most expensive of the two projects which we favour is only half that of the formerly suggested line from Bandar Abbas to Jask, which was calculated to cost ^30,500. The expense of maintenance will be slightly greater, inasmuch as, in addition to an office at Bandar Abbas, it will be necessary to maintain one at Henjam also. The existence of a station at this place will, however, apart from any considerations of political advantage arising out of a reoccupation of the island, be in itself a distinct gain as affording a point in the fair way up the Gulf in termediate between Maskat and Bushire, at which communication can be made with His Majesty's ships of war. With the object of providing improved facilities in this respect, the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station proposed early in 1902 the location of a telegraph station in the mouth of the Gulf-—the place then suggested by him being Bassidore—and the advantage which would arise from the possession of such means of communication in the event of trouble at any point in the Persian Gulf is manifest. 4. Prior to the occupation of the island for telegraphic purposes in 1869, considerable discussion took place as to the ownership of Henjam. Rival claims were urged on behalf'iM m ;i' ■^1 72 of the Sultan of Maskat on the one hand, and the Persian Government on the other. The Government of India of that day, however, held that the claims of the Shah must prevail, and that his consent must be sought. The necessary permission to occupy the island was ciulv accorded in the marginally noted Minute of the Persian Government, a copy of which aDDears to have been communicated to Lord Stanley by Sir Charlrs Alison, then Minister at Tehran in his letter No. 42, dated the 31st March 1868. Our abandonment of the station does not seem to have formed the subject of any formal communication to the Persian Government, and the authority granted has, so far as we are aware, never been cancelled or withdrawn. We consider, therefore, that the permission still holds good and would require no express renewal; and we would propose merely to communicate to the Persian Government, through the Indo-Telegraph Department, our intention to land the cable again for purposes of telegraphic convenience at llenjam and to re-open our former station there. It might at the same time be pointed out to the Persian Gov ernment that the proposal is one that will benefit them no less than ourselves, by linking up one of their most important Gulf ports with the system of electric telegraph which has already lent so great support to the Shah's authority in outlying parts of his dominions. If, however, objections should be raised at Tehran, it might be pointed out that, in the event of obstacles being placed in the way of our re-occupation of Henjam, we shall merely substitute a station at Bassidore, where we have land of our own, in which case Persia would lose the advantage of connection with Bandar Abbas. 5. As regards the incidence of the cost of the proposal, we may point out that telegraphic connection with Maskat has now been effected at the sole charge of the Indian Gov- ernment, and w r e feel sanguine, therefore, that His Majesty's Government will not object to bear half the cost of the present project, the advantages of which are no less Imperial than Indian. From reports received from our Resident in the Persian Gulf we learn that the Russian Consul-General at Bushire, in company with the Persian Passport Officer of the Gulf Ports, has made recent excursions to the islands of Larak, Ormuz and Kishm. What may be the object of these visits we do not know, but we think it very desirable that no time should be lost in taking advantage of the superior position which the facts that we have narrated give us on the island of Kishm, and we are forwarding a copy of this despatch direct to His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, in order that Sir Arthur Hardinge may be in a position to place his views on the subject before His Majesty's Government at the earliest possible date. A copy is also being furnished to His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief on the East Indies Station with a similar object. ai6. With reference to the above despatch. Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to Secret E., June .9.4, n m . 300-388 (No.300). f he Government of India on 26th June, that it would be simpler simultaneously with the opening of the station at Henjam to announce to the Persian Government that difficulties of communication with our Consulate at Bandar Abbas had led us to avail ourselves once more of the Shah's permission which was given us in 1868, there being, we hoped, no doubt that the Persian Government would authorize a further extension of the line for 50 miles from Henjam to Bandar Abbas itself. The Persians, Sir A. Hardinge thought, would not dispute our right once we con fronted them with an accomplished fact; but if we notified our intention before hand, they might create difficulties, as their suspicion would certainly be aroused. The chief of the Indo-European Department thought that, unless there was urgent reason for immediate action, the re-opening of the station had better be deferred till September at the earliest on account of the heat. Sir A. Hardinge's telegram was followed by a despatch to the Governrnent Secret E. t June 1904, Nos. 300-388. of India, dated 27th June, sending his . . , despatch dated 26th Tune, to the Foreign Omce, explanatory of the telegram. Ibid, No. 306. State s— 217. On 4th August 1903 the Viceroy telegraphed as follows to the Secretary of Cnmm IT hpr t0 7 t l 1 May.

Hardlnge telegraphed to the Foreign Office that he was unable to discover in the archives of the Legation at Tehran the original permission to occupy Henjam, and he intimated that unless further search was successful the procedure suggested in his Secret despatch dated 16th June, must be modified. 219. In the Secretary of State's telegram dated 28th October for 1903, inti mation was conveyed to us that the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty agreed that Bassidore would be preferable to Henjam for cable station for naval and general purposes. 220. The Government then consulted Rear Admiral Atkinson Willes, Naval ^ N Commander-in-Chief, on the question ' ' 0 ' 322 * of selecting a place for a cable station for naval purposes. It was pointed out that this question should he kept distinct from the question of a naval basis or anchorage and establishment (letter No. 73-C., dated 2nd December 1903, Viceroy's Camp). 221. His Excellency the Rear Admiral replied on 3rd December stating that after visiting Henjam and Bassidore he /iid. No. 333. no i n pronouncing in favour of the former for a telegraph and signal station ; it is more easy of approach from either side of the strait and although not a place which can be transformed into a naval station it is better fitted for a naval signal station in certain contingencies. 222. The question was threshed out during His Excellency Lord Curzon's tour* in the Persian Gulf in company with /4»d, No. 326. the Naval Commander-in-Chief and in their despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 16 Secret External, dated 21st June 1904, the Government of India pointed out that the earlier discussions particularly by 'the naval authorities appear to have missed the mark by mixing up the question of naval station and cable station. The reinstitution of the former cable station was not proposed in order to create a naval port or station there, but in order to provide for our ships a place of telegraphic call or signal station at no great distance from the entrance of the Gulf and to strengthen our hold upon the island of Kishm, where we already possessed a British settlement at the western extremity, and to which the smaller island of Henjam physically belongs. Fqr these purposes the Viceroy and the Naval Commander-in-Chief concurred in the conclusion that Henjam was a greatly superior locality to Bassidore, which had previously been considered by the admiralty to offer greater advantages. The despatch then turned to a consideration of the method by which further action should be taken. There were three alternatives. Either we might address the Pe¥sian Government and solicit their permission to re-establish our former telegraph station at Henjam ; or we might inform them that we propose to take this^step in the exercise of right of possession, which, though not utilised for iyears had never been surrendered; or we might simply send a telegraph ship there'and might resume possession of the former site, informing the Persian Government^of the accomplished fact and explaining that we had decided to restore to our old station on the original terms, which included freedom from customs interference, for the convenience of our ships and Commanders in the Gulf. The site was quite unmistakeable ; the plinth upon which the British Tele graph Station stood from 1869 to 1881 was still in a good state, and the trench in which the cable was laid to the sea was clearly visible. The Mahk-ut-Tujjar, who held a lease of the Kishm salt-mines, had erected a flag-pole on this foundation some twelve years ago, but it did not appear that a flag was ever hoisted upon it, or that any representations of the Persian Government were now upon the island. In either case the Persian Government might be conciliated by the proposal to carry on the telegraph wire, either by land or by sea, from Henjam to Bandar Abbas. In the event of His Majesty's Government accepting these proposals, the Government of India trusted that they would consent to bear at least one half of the cost of the arrangements. The telegraph was asked for in the main in the ~ *See Chapter V. [c645fd] ! I 1 »74 interests of the naval squadron which is maintained In the Persian Gulf by His Majesty's Government, and also on political grounds, which are divided in even proportions between the Imperial Government and the Government of India. 223. His Majesty's Government approved of this proposal, and in his telegram, dated 8th March 1904, the Secretary /htd, No. 334. of State informed the Viceroy that Sir A. Hardinge proposed in the first instance to inform the Persian Government of our intention tore-establish Henjam station and to ask for permission to extend the cable to Bandar Abbas. 234. On the 17th March 1904 Sir A. Hardinge wired ' The Prime Minister whom I sounded about Bandar Abbas line, without mentioninw Henjam, said he would gladly discuss the question. I shall send in my note in a few day's time, letting Viceroy know exactly when 1 do so. Ship should meanwhile be ready, at a moment's notice to start.' 225. Some difficulty was experienced in getting up material for cable and for shipping it in time to Henjam. It was therefore proposed by the Director of Gulf Telegraphs Department to land the present cable on the southern or south-eastern coast ot the island of Henjam, but the Viceroy insisted that the Henjam connection should be made forthwith and not on the southern or south-eastern coast because we had only right to the old site given us by the Persian Government on the north. This accordingly must be re-occupied and connection established with it without further delay (Telegram to Mr. Whitby Smith, dated 1st April). 226. A party accordingly sailed from Karachi in the Patrick Stewart on 9th Secret E., June 1904, No. 300 388 (No. 353-) J i neCeSSar y materials and established cable communication with Henjam on the old site on 19th April 1904. 227. Sir A. Hardinge sent on 30th March, a copy of a note which he Secret e., December .904, No,. .. 3 s. w f? addressing the Musbir-ed-DewIah, in which he informed him that the Govern- ment of India had been sensible for some time past, especially now that a Bri tish Consul resides at Bandar Abbas, of the desirability of opening telegraphic com- munication between that port and Bushire urged by the British Indian residents of the place in their address to the Viceroy during his visit there, and they had accordingly instructed him to enter into negotiations with the Persian Govern- ment with a view to an extension of the present submarine cable from Heniam to Bandar Abbas ; and that in the meanwhile pending of the conclusion of the arrangements for this purpose, the Government of India had decided to land the cable and re-open the &lt; Indo-European Telegraph Department station on the island of Henjam, which had existed from 1869 to 1881 and was abandoned in the latter year. 22S. In reply to this note Mushir-ed-Dowlah stated that the Shah would construct the line h.mself, but that the work would not be done immediately, which is a ersian way of saying never, and that in the meanwhile a postal service between the two places would be organized. Sir A. Hardinge politely pointed out he absurdity of adopting this proposal which in the long r?n would be more costly than a telegraph line. He also proposed to the Government of India the lines on which an agreement would be made with the Shah's Government the GoverZemof India ) Pr0P0Sed (TeleSram ' dated ^ May ,904, t0 Government ^ ,5t ! 1 to the Secretary of State, the Government of India urged that the Indo-European TeWranh Demrtmpnt fffiTe arBunderltb^TV P arts of ^elr system.

In July 1904, a report was received at Tehran from the Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports that our telegraph Secret e ., December 1904, Nos. 1 -36 (Nos. 11-14). people at Henjam had removed the Persian flag and hoisted the British flag. In tele graphing about this report to the Resident, Sir A. Hardinge observed that there was evidently some misapprehension on the matter, but if the Persian flag had been removed for building purposes, it should be rehoisted elsewhere. He had no recollection of seeing the British flagon any inland telegraph station, and he wished that it should not be hoisted at Henjam, unless it was customary to do so at telegraph stations in other parts of the Gulf. 232. On enquiries being made, it was found that the report was most un- ibid No. 11. founded. The old Persian flagstaff was still standing on our plinth and no British flag had been hoisted. All our telegraph stations at Bushire, Gwadur and jask have regular official flagstaffs with signalling yards and are entitled to fly a flag. The same prescribed rights would presumably be assumed in the case of Henjam, but nothing had hitherto been done or suggested in that direction (Major Cox to Sir A Hardinge dated 1st July 1904). 233. On 2nd July 1904, Sir A. Hardinge forwarded to the Mushir-ed-Dowlah translation of a telegram he had received from the Resident at Bushire and observed ;— I understand that there has never been a Persian flag on Henjam, but only a pole on a plinth over the British station which was erected sonce years ago by the Malik-ut- Tujjar after an unsuccessful attempt to raise it on the south coast of the island. The erection of this flag and pole was resisted at the time by the local Arabs on the ground that Henjam belongs to the Shaikh of Dabat, one of the six Arab Chiefs on the south coast of the Persian Gulf, who are under the protection of the Government of India. There is no intention on the part oj the Government of India to support any such claim on the part of the Shaikh of Dahaior to repudiate the authority oi the Persian Government over Henjam, Should it, therefore, as probably will be the case, be necessary to remove the pole in order to complete the building, such removal need in no way be regarded as having any political significance, more especially as it would not be the flag, but merely a flagless pole, which would betaken away for necessary building purposes, and which could, if indeed, be reerected elsewhere. Should a flag be eventually flown at Henjam, it will 'be similar to those which have been flown for many years pant with the consent of the Persian Government at other telegraph stations on the coast, such as Jask, Gwadur and Bushire y and which, I may mention parenthetically, are necessary for signalling purposes, and cannot be regarded as having a political object, I trust that these explanations may prove satisfactory to Your Excellency. I need scarcely add that His Britannic Majesty's Government has never denied the sovereignty of Persia over Henjam, as is shown by the fact that our occupation is derived by the concession granted to us by His Majesty the late Shah. (iii) Extension of the line to Bandar Abbas. 234. On a6th March 1905, Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to us that the Persian ^ ^ c v Government had officially notified its Secret e ., juna 1905, Nos. 759-77 (0.7 0. willingness to construct the Henjam Bandar Abbas line via Kishm with English Engineers and materials and to employ no foreigners in it, and that Mushir-ed-Dowlah was ready to sign an agreement defining conditions of employment of our engineers. 235. The following is the agreement that was finally signed on 13th May Ibid, Nos. 771-773 and Secret E., August 1905, Nos.416-417. I905: ■ AGREEMENT. His Excellency the Mashir-ed-Dowleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs of His Imperial _ , r. -vr Maiesty the Shah of Persia and Sir Arthur Enclosure Pro. No. 410. ur j- t? u- t&gt; u - \k • l &gt; Haidmge, K. C. 13., His iintannic Majesty s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, representing the Indo- European Telegraph Department of the Government of India, on the other part, duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments have concluded the following agreement, 1. The Persian Government having resolved to construct a line of telegraph to con nect the Indo-European Telegraph Station at Henjam with Bunder Abbas across Kishm and His Majesty's Government having authorised the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment to provide the Engineers and materials necessary for the construction, it is agreed that two European engineers with the necessary employes and labourers shall be temporarily placed by the Department for the purpose at the disposal of the* Persian Government, and that the telegraph s.hip belonging to the Department shall, as soon as the season permits, lay the two submarine ends between Henjam and Bunder Abbas, respectively, and after completing the work they shall return.76 2 As soon as the line is complete and the cost of materials and charges of the engineer and telegraph ship have been paid, the line shall be handed over to the Persian Ministry of Telegraphs. The Persian Government shall also have a telegraph office built at Henjam at their own cost and appoint Persian telegraphists. The Bunder Abbas line shall be connected with the Persian telegraph office atHenjam and ail messages for abroad which are received from Bunder Abbas and which are to be communicated by the English tele- graph office at Henjam shall be received by the Persian t elegraph office and immediately transmitted to the English telegraph office. 3. The charges 1 to be made by the' Indo-European Department for the services of the engineers and telegraph ship shall not exceed 75,000 rupees and the payment of the above sum is guaranteed by the Persian Government. 4. The declaration of the Persian Government that it will not employ foreign, ie., non-Persian subjects in the working of the line shall not be held to preduae it from employing at the usual charges such subjects in the service of the Indo-European Tele graph Department for any repairs to the submarine cables or other works which may be necessary in connection with the maintenance and upkeep of the line, nor from allowing at the Bunder Abbas office a British signaller to deal with State messages sent on behalf of the British Government to and from its Consulate at Bunder Abbas should the British Government desire it. Done in duplicate at Tehran on the 13th day of May in the year 1905, equivalent to the 8th day of Rebbi-ul-Avvel in the year 1323 A. H. Seal. (Sd.) A. H ardinge. 235. It will be noted that the agreement provides for a Persian Telegraph Office being built at Henjam at the cost of the Persian Government and worked by Persian telegraphists. Sir A. Hardinge pointed out to the Shah's Govern ment the unnecessary waste of money involved in this, but the Shah, it appears, persisted in inserting the clause. 236. Captain Trevor reported on 4th November 1905 that the cable portions of the line had been successfully laid up to Bandar Abbas. The Governor objected— pending receipt of instructions from Tehran—to allow the cable to land there • and it seems the Belgian customs authorities urged him to this course. When it was, however, explained that the delay of the telegraph ship would cost the Persian Government Rs. 700 a day, which he might have to pay, the cable was allowed to be landed, (iv). Encroachment of Persian customs officials on telegraph st ation ground at Henjam. Erection of Persian and customs flag staffs on the island. 237. The Persian Government suspecting that the British Government had ulterior aims in establishing themselves at Henjam, have been making them- selves as obstructive as possible at the telegraph station. From the records of the Residency it would appear that the old telegraph station extended from the northern end of the island back to the cliff line on the southern side of the valley. Within this space the Persian Government have erected two flagstaffs, and established a Customs Mirza, who for fear of the Arabs rising against him resides in a hut close to the telegraph station and under the shelte? afforded by the presence of the Telegraph Superintendent. 238. The position of the flag staffs and customs hut, etc., is explained by Major Secret E., September 1905, Nos. 68-104 (No. 94). ^' ox ^ his report l\o. 242, dated 2nd June I9 0 5j an d a sketch map accompanying it J' 4 ' J now have the honour to record the present position in regard to one or two matters of detad and to request consideration of them and such action as may be deemed necessary. J 1. FlatsUffs.-~Ki present we have no flagstafls anywhere on the telegraph station; whereas the Persians rejoice in two, vide sketch map attached ; one which 1 will call J 200 yards to the east of our building and the other (J), about 400 yaids to the west of it and known as the Customs Flagstaff. From both of these the Persian flag is now flowi though up to our return to the Island last year no Persian flag had ever been hoisted on it. The erection of (.1) in its present position was reported in Residency telegram, dated i^-S 1° dNT'.sfi ,90S ' ^ 3rd. January .905, and His Excellency the that he was suggesting to the Persian Goyernment'thlt somVf.TaT.gl^e ^^hould' te' Tome flown from it on 14th October ,go!

Customs //«/.—For position, see sketch map. This was also a point with regard to which His Excellency the Minister in his telegram of 14th January suggested that an arrangement should be come to between our telegraph clerk and the local officials, but no local official appeared at Henjam to consult our Telegraph Superintendent, and the Bel gian Customs Administration had the hut erected where it pleased them, without reference to him. The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, objects to its present position. 3. Quite recently, preparatory to his visit to Henjam, His Excellency the Darya Begi had two mat shelters run up at the landing place for his own use, and this spot is now suggested as the probable site which the Persian authorit ies have their eyes upon for a per manent building. It does not appear to me however to be in any way a suitable site tor any building, and there is in any case no tangible evidence at present to support the above surmise. 4. On the other hand, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas reports on good authority that the Director of Customs has invited tenders for the erection of a substantial building on Henjam, and that one well-known merchant gave a tender for 5 ,000 Tomans. This figure was considered too high and the Director is said to be anxious to get it done for 2,5000 Tomans. It is not known for what purpose such a building is contemplated ; whether for cus toms premises or for a telegraph office. 5. Having recorded the foregoing items of factor information, I respectfully invite a scrutiny of the accompanying sketch map. The first thing to be done before any questions of site can be satisfactorily considered seems to be for us to decide what limits we are ia a position to claim for the ' British Telegraph Station.' I submit that on our old record we could claim from the northern shore of the island back to the cliff-line on the southern side of the valley containing our cultivation, and along that boundary east and west from sea to sea, as shewn by the red line in the sketch map. In the time of our former occupation we seem to have held this much undisputedly, furthermore a considerable amount of British money was spent on the maintenance and erection of the numerous rain water reservoirs ou the rocky ground north on the valley and round the plinth, and in the valley itself and industrious British community excavated numerous wells and thereby kept under cultivation a considerable tract of ground. This cultivation has been re-started and the tract supplies its own evidence of our previous ' Uo 29 in Secret E., December 1934, Nos 1-36. OCCupatioa. The present Superintendent of Telegraphs has done a good deal in the direction of clearing out wells, making bunds and planting date palms. A small crop of grain has even been sown and gathered this season under his direction. It seems important therefore if we are going to maintain the station at Henjam that we should not forego our claim to this cultivated tract, if only to give a little distraction and interest in liie to our Telegraph Staff. 6. The next point for consideration seems to be this— Supposing we are in a position to claim for the British Telegraph Station the limits indicated above, what does the substantiation of that claim involve? How far can we pre vent the Persian Government from taking up sites within those limits without our con currence ? and within what limits can we speak of K encroachment on our ground vide Minister's telegram of 14th January 1905. In this connection I understand it to be the viewt of the Director of Persian Gulf t No. 1529 in Secret E., Februarj i9 0 S&gt; Nos. Telegraphs from a departmental standpoint that 15331536. in any case no structures, buildings or flagstaffs should be allowed to the north of a line passing east and west through the village shewn on the sketch map. I presume we shall at least endeavour to secure this. 7. Then as to the present and future position of the Persian flagstaffs; in the first place it seems unnecessary and gratuitous that there should be two flagstaffs perched one on each side of our new Telegraph building under construction. One should be elimin ited. If {a) is to remain, there seems no particular objection to its present site, for a flag staff only, but i£ it is intended to mark a site for Customs quarters as is said to be the case i a ^ree with the Assistant Superintendent in thinking that the site is open to objec tion, as apart from the fact that it looks down on our building the drainage from it would run down a gully to one of the newly repaired water reservoirs and would befoul it. 8v I may mention that the 'village' shewn on the plan consists merely of four or five mud tenements and a few more thatched huts. Ordinarily 1 oelieve they areas often as not unoccupied. At present they are tenanted by labourers working on our telegraph build ing or menials of the Telegraph establishment. The building shewn as the Moin -ut-Tujjar's godown is merely a mud tenement built and used by the^Moin's agent or farmer when there is any export of salt going on. There are still some heaps of earthy salt lying on the shore as shewn in the plan, said to belong to the Moin's man. C6^5FDr 78 0, I trust that the foregoing observations, read by the light of the plan, will make the actual position clear, and will enable the Government of India and His Majesty's Legation to come to a definite decision as to what line it is expedient for us to adopt both with regard to the limits of our telegraph station and other points dealt with in the foregoing. 239. The establishment of the Persian Customs at Henjam created great ex- citement among the Arabs. It was clear to them that the customs was established for no revenue purposes, but for a political purpose, that is, in order to assert the Persian sovereignty over the island. The Arabs, who belong to the same tribe as those of Debai, were in no mood to tolerate this exercise of sovereignty, and were very much inclined to attack the Customs Mirza. The latter, however, established himself close to the telegraph station and depended for his water on oar tanks. The Arabs who looked up to the British for protection, like their brethren at Debai, did not evidently look favourably upon the protection afforded to the customs Mirza thereby. The Arab Sheikh spoke to Lieutenant Shakespear in February 1905 of his determination never to acknowledge Persian sovereignty, but was told by the Assistant Resident not to create any trouble or disturbance until he wrote to him or came personally to see him after receiving an answer to the reference of his case to the Resident. Some definite statement of our policy or attitude had soon to be made to the Arab Sheikh, to tell him that he is a subject of Persia and that we have nothing to do with him and at the same time to let the Persian Mirza reside within the shelter of the telegraph station was calculated to impair our relations with the Arabs and also to endanger the safety of our telegraph station. There was no reason moreover why we should assume any responsibility for the subsistence or safety of an official, who, except as a spy upon ourselves, had no raison d'etre on the island. In these circumstances the Viceroy asked Sir A. Hardinge whether it would not be advisable to inform the Persian Government that they must either remove the Mirza without delay from the neighbourhood of the station (which would be tantamount to withdrawal from the island) or permit us to post Indian guard for the protection of our men. 240. The proposal for sending a guard to Henjam had been made by Sir A. o „ Q , c Hardinge when on 24 th December 1004 Secret E.| March 1905, Nos. 805 Sia. , t i , . ,. , , ? ~ he notmed the establishment of customs post there. He, however, subsequently asked that the despatch of the guard might be postponed, as it would probably suggest the idea that the telegraph station was a cloak to military occupation and be detrimental to the settlement of the question of the Henjam-Bandar Abbas extension. 241. In the circumstances reported in April 1905, the Government preferred Secret E„ September .905, No,. 68..04. (So, 75). ' insis , t on th e Customs Mirza being remov- ed, as that would mean return to status quo, recovering our prestige with the Arabs and dispensing with the cost of a guard (Telegram from the Viceroy to Sir A. Hardinge, dated 6th May 1905). ibid, No. 77. 2 4 2 - Sir A. Hardinge replied on 7th May 1905 ;— If we ask for removal of the Mirza or establishment of an Indian guard to protect our station, the Persian Government will undoubtedly reply with an offer to send Persian troops for the security of both. Ihis will not improve matters. Perhaps the Customs Mirza would leave the island without waiting for instructions from M. Naus, if the Arabs were to threaten to kill him. I his has happened on the Trans-Caspian Frontier, Do we think we need go out of our way to protect the Mirza? We can always send an Indian guaid tor ourselves once the telegraph agreement is signed/' Secret e., September 1905, Nos. 68.-04. ^ 0 ^ 0w ' n g measures were then taken to protect our position at Henjam :— I. British men-of-war were ordered whenever passing up and down ibid, No. 80. the Gulf to call at Henjam , D , ., [ an d occasionally at Lingah and Bandar Abbas]—see telegram from Naval Commander-in- May 1905 nt l n dia, Marine Department, dated 13th II. Major Cox was told to inform the Customs Mirza, as suggested by ibid, No. 85. that the water-supply at u . , Henjam was low and that he } f ™ ted ^ raw ^ rom our tanks any longer (Tele gram dated 19th May 1905).79 ^datei if ter-^P When Major Cox visited Henjam in June &lt;905, he found a third incumbent in the customs post. He had made arrangements to get water from Deristan. III.—Sir A. Hardinge thought that as to the Sheikh of Henjam it was best for Major Cox to tell him, in case he again raised the question of the presence of Persian officers on the island, that His Majesty's Government have recognized Persian sove reignty over Henjam (but not over Tamb). During the visit of Major Cox to Henjam above referred to the Arabs were busy preparing for pearl fishing and their Sheikh did not come to meet him. Major Cox left a note for the Sheikh saying that ' I was sorry to have missed him, but that in any case, I was confident that until he had an opportunity of meeting (myself) or His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas, he would as heretofore abide by the advice of the Telegraph Superinten dent.' 244. As a result of his visit to and inspection of our station at Henjam (report of which has been quoted in para. 238 above), Major Cox suggested to Sir A. Hardinge that he might notify to the Persian Government that we must be con sulted as to the site for a building which they seem to have contemplated erecting and for which tenders had been invited and as to the final position of their flagstaff (Telegram dated 1st June 1905). 245. Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed to Major Cox on 2nd June;— 'I think that we can hardly dictate to the Persian Government as to where it shall put its flagstaff on Henjam, unless its hoisting is consequently inconvenient to our office for telegraph purposes, and I think we should be careful to avoid suggesting that we regard with unfriendly eye Persian sovereignty over the island. The building for which tender is invited is perhaps the Persian telegraph office on which Shah inserted a condition of extension of telegraph line to Bunder Abbas^ but erection of which I regard as somewhat problematical.' 246. Major Cox telegraphed to Sir Arthur Hardinge on the 28th June, repeating a report from the Superintendent of Telegraphs, Henjam, that the male population of the Arab village of that island being away at the pearl-fisheries, the Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas proceeded to Henjam on the 25th June in the Customs steamer, and visited the Arab village, where only a few men remained in charge of the women. 247. He invited a Persian of Kishm, who is dwelling among the Arabs, to become the Persian Customs Mirza of the village on a salary of krans 2,000 a year. The Director promised to erect a house and flagstaff for him similar to that erected on the north side of the island. He added that there was no intention to farm the Customs, but that the measures proposed were necessary in order to prevent Englishmen from claiming the island later on. Informants signed a statement as to what took place at the Custom Director's visit and also a state ment attested by all persons who were present at the conversation that they were to the same effect as the original report. Major Cox reported that the Arab Sheikh of the village was expected in a few days from the Pirate coast, and asked what line should be taken if the Sheikh referred to H. M.'s Consul at Bandar Abbas, or to himself. 248. On the 29th June, Sir Arthur Hardinge telegraphed that he had addressed a strong protest to the Minister of Customs, against the language used by the Director of Customs, into which, he said, he should hold an enquiry, and that he had requested an explanation. 249. Sir Arthur Hardinge's view was that we must recognise such consequences of Persian sovereignty as the presence of flags and a Customs officer on Henjam, but that if the Persian actually oppressed the Arabs and if any of the h^ter came to the telegraph station for sanctuary, he would take the matter up at Tehran and protect them. But in the meantime, he informed Major Cox, the Arab Sheikh should be warned that we recognise Henjam as part of Persia, and that, if his people attack the Telegraph or Customs officials, British and Persian soldiers would probably be sent to Henjam. r1* So 350. Sir Arthur Hardinge informed Major Cox on the 28ih June, in reply to the latter's representations regarding the evident purpose of the Persian Govern ment to surround the telegraph office on Henjam with Persian buildings, that, generally speaking, he believed the course most advantageous to the interests of our station on Henjam, would be to endeavour^ to settle all questions, as far as possible on the spot, in a spirit of friendliness and co-operation with the Persian authorities. 251. In the meantime, the Superintendent of the Telegraph Station on Henjam telegraphed on the 20th August that the Customs Mirza on Henjam was taking advantage of the fact that he and his men were practically in sanctuary in our Telegraph precincts (which the Arabs have some fear of violating) to behave in a truculent manner towards the natives. 25a. Major Cox forwarded a copy of this telegram to the Government of India on the 20th August, and explained that His Majesty's Minister at Tehran did not in his instructions (para. 250 above) appear to differentiate at all between British telegraph station on Henjam and the rest of that island. 253. On the 8th September, Major Cox telegraphed that, according to a report from the Telegraph Superintendent, a Customs contractor had arrived at Henjam with workmen and building material, and had marked out and enclosed building site in the vicinity of the telegraph office. The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, objected to the proximity of the proposed building to our own office, as being unnecessary, insanitary, and as likely to interfere with signalling operations. 254. On the 27th September 1905, the Government of India telegraphed to Mr. Grant Duff (Sir Arthur Hardinge having left Tehran) that the situation on Henjam, which was both undignified and inconvenient, did not seem to admit of local settlement on the basis of allowing the erection of Persian buildings and flag staffs in close and undesirable proximity to the British telegraph buildings The main object of our resumption of former rights would thereby be nullified. An agreement should be concluded with the Persian Government defining the area of the British telegraph station in the same manner as in the agreement concluded in 1887 in regard to the area of the telegraph station at Jask. and within these limits no Persian buildings or flagstaffs should, of course, be erected. Outside they might be erected in any numbers, or anywhere. In return for such an agreement conceding a reasonable area of ground, we should be willing to convey to the Arabs oui formal recognition of Persian sovereignty over Henjam, to use our influence to tranquillise the Arabs, and to abstain from sending a military guard to the island, unless Persia did the same. If the agreement proposed above were declined, we might say that the despatch of a guard was necessary for the protection of our telegraph station, and that the requirements of thesignal- ^ al:ion n ^ cess ^ a ^ e ^ ^he removal of all other flagstaffs from its vicinity. . r * ar ^ Duff was asked whether an arrangement on these lines would be fea- si e, and it was suggested that further reason for requesting the removal of the Persian flagstaffs might be found in the needs of our signalling station. The re- su t 0 the arrangement suggested would be a British enclave on a Persian island. a ^55- On the 28th September, Mr, Grant Duff telegraphed that he was confi dent thePersian Government would oppose the establishment of a British enclave , e ^ am J aj&gt; proposed in the Government of India telegram of the 27th K v C ^ a ^ u est P ° lic y at Present, he considered, was that recommended C J . l , * aruin .?e.

Mr. Grant Puff note to the Persian Government in the sense of this telegram.8i ^ % ' ' (1 357. On the nth October, the Government of India telegraphed to the Sec retary of State, pointing out that a memorandum, dated 22nd August 1905, clearly demonstrated the objections to permitting further encroachments on our station. Hope was expressed that Mr. Grant Uuff would be authorized to effect a settle ment on the lines indicated in our telegram dated 2yth September to him, using, if necessary, the threat, which he believed would be effective, of despatching a guard to the island. 258. Captain Trevor (Assistant Political Resident, Bushire), telegraphed on ttflj the 5th November that M. Stas (Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas) visited the island on the 28th October, and appeared to agree that the present site of the proposed Persian building was unsuitable, and telegraphed to Tehran for instructions. Since then building operations have been suspended. Captain Trevor suggested that Messrs. Stas and Shakespeare (H. M.'s Consul at Bandar Abbas) should be authorised to go together, and, if possible, fix upon a suitable site. On the same date Captain Trevor forwarded a letter from Lieutenant Shakespeare which gave an account of a private interview between himself and the Sheikh of the Arabs on Henjam. The latter was evidently growing restless at receiving no answer to his question as to whether he and his people were to be under British protection or Persian subjects. Lieutenant Shakespeare informed him that the matter was still under discussion, and counselled him to have patience. He pointed out, however, that the temper of the Arabs was not by any means the same as in February or April last. He anticipates an outbreak of violence when the Arabs would be informed that they could hope for nothing from the British Government, but considered that this risk would be minimised if the Persian Customs Mirza could be removed from his position in the close vicini ty of the Telegraph Office where the Arabs consider he was practically under British protection. 258-A. Captain Trevor also forwarded a second letter on the 5th November from Mr. R.Campbell, Officiating Director, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section, in which he, too, dwelt upon the excitable state of the Arabs on Henjam. He also stated his views in regard to the encroachments of the Persian on the Telegraph area, and considered that they its might be permitted to erect a Telegraph Office, and if they so desired, a (b: Customs Office within the Telegraph area ; but that these buildings should be 1 sei erected at a considerable distance 'rom our Telegraph Office, and that, for sanitary to®: reasons, the Persian employes should be limited to a small number. But the 1,1! flagstaff which had been erected to the east of the Telegraph Office should be aij removed, as materially affecting efficient signalling when the station is made p a Lloyd's signalling station. 259. On the 9th November, the Secretary of State for India telegraphed, in reply to the Government of India telegram of the nth October, to the eli'ect that any arrangement which would tend to create British enclave on Henjam would certainly be opposed by the Persian Government; and further that His Majesty's Government were of opinion that a show of force, even if effectual, would be of doubtful expediency. They therefore considered that further efforts should be made to settle the matter locally at Bushire, but added that, if the amenities of the telegraph station on Henjam were seriously affected by Persian encroachments, instructions to protest would be sent to His Majesty's Charge d 5 Affaires, Tehran. This telegram was repeated to Major Cox on the 1st December for his guidance, and he was further informed that, if the amenities of the telegraph station were seriously affected by Persian encroachments, he would no doubt point it out. 259A. On the 26th November Major Cox reported to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, that although the Persian building operations on Henjam had been suspended, the Customs authorities had now officially intimated their intention to commence building the Imperial Customs house forthwith and had selected for the purpose a site in our telegraph station. He asked that the Persian Government should be again pressed to suspend all building operations until the question had been settled between the two Govern ments. 260. With reference to the language stated to have been used by M. Stas at Henjam, Mr. Grant Duff in a despatch, dated the 10th October, stated that M. Naus had expressed a hope that the matter might be allowed to drop. It C645FD83 aopears that M. Stas not only denied having used the language imputed to him, but could bring witnesses to prove that the British telegraph clerk stationed at Heniam had told him that Persian Customs officials had no business on the island. In conclusion Mr. Grant Duff hoped that he miglu consider the inci- dent closed. The Government of India also considered that it was unnecessary to go further into the credibility of M. Stas. (v) Persian Customs interference with Henjam mail bags, 1904-05. 261. In August 1904, a weekly boat service was established by the Belgian Customs Officer at Bandar Abbas ostensibly secret e., march 1905, nos 330-339' to facilitate the delivery of telegrams to the Bandar Abbas community. The clerk in charge of the telegraph station, Henjam, telegraphed on the 17th September 1904 to Major Cox that the Director of Customs had informed the Postmaster, Bandar Abbas, that he had observed bags of letters arriving for his post office from Henjam, and that as this was contrary to the Postal Union Convention, which disallows the carrying of letters between Persian ports except by the Persian Post Office, he desired that the practice should be stopped. The clerk added that the mail bags were now arriving open, both inwards and outwards, were examined by the Persian authorities and were not allowed to be sealed, A detailed report was also forwarded, describing the stopping of the Henjam mail bag carrier by a Customs official on the 12th September and the opening of the mail bag by the postmaster under compulsion by the Director of Customs. On the 15th September, the Director of Customs ordered the postmaster at Bandar Abbas to send the bag to him for inspection before despatch to Henjam. The bag was inspected , and the Kossid informed that all mails, to and from the island, were to be shown to the Director of Customs for inspection. The matter was referred by Major Cox to the Minister. Major Cox telegraphed on 14th January 1905 that the Customs authorities had officially intimated the inauguration of a post office and customs post at Henjam. 262. On the night of the 5th January 1905, the Henjam mail bag from the telegraph station, when brought to Bandar Abbas by the Kossid was again seized by the Customs authorities, who retained it until noon of the following day and only returned it on the representation of the British Consulate after the bag had been opened and the contents inspected. The matter was reported to the Government of India and His Majesty's Legation at Tehran. I he latter replied that orders were being issued for discontinuance of the interference. 263. Sir A. Hardinge telegraphed on 14th February that the Persian Govern ment were inclined to conclude an agreement on the following lines (1) that the post bags containing letters should be separated from those^ containing parcels, which latter would be examined by the Customs authorities in accordance with article 27 of the Reglement Legal; (2) that a special arrangement should be made to regulate the exchange of postal correspondence between India and Persia. 264. The Persian Government pointed out that Persia had now a parcel postal service of her ow'n, and that it could never have been intended that parcels containing dutiable articles should enter the country through our post offices without payment of duty*. CHAPTER. VIII. Our position at Bassidore. (i) Alleged intention of the Russians to take possession of Kishm : our position at Bassidore. secret e., May 1899, nos. 160-65. 2 ^5- On 15th March 1899 the Secretary ^ tate telegraphed to the Viceroy and Islands Prec^^8$4-igos 6 pU3tal drran Sement3 on the Persian Cuast ports is dealt with in the Persian Coast 'chapter 180f ' l8 53 paras. 336-239, and Persian Coast and Islandsf\ *■ 83 Telegram P., dated the 15th March 1899, From—Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To— His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. O'Conor transmits an extract from Constantinople paper reporting intention of Russia to take possession of Kishm at the entrance of Persian Gulf. Are the barracks at Bassidore still in charge of British officials, and under what title was Kishm occupied by us ? 265-A. The reply was :— Telegram, P., No. 4^6-E.A., dated the 18th March 1899. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Please refer to your Foreign Secret telegram, 15th March. Our occupation of Kishm appears to have begun in 1820 under verbal* grant from Sultan Saiyid Saeed o£ Maskat, to whom island then belonged, vide my Persia, Volume II, page 423. This was confirmed by agreement with his son and successor Sultan Thoweynee in 1864, see Aitchison, Volume XI, page 75, in spite of fact that Kishm had been taken in 1852 by Per sia and leased in 1855 to Maskat, see Aitchison^ Volume X, page 100, and Appendix 45. The Persians took no exception to our occupation either when they leased Kishm to Maskat in 1855 and again in 1 868, or when they forcibly terminated lease in latter year, see our Foreign Office Proceedings, Political A., August 1880, No. 112, and onwards. The Government buildings at Bassidore are in charge of a coal agent who is a paid British Indian servant, and has remained continuously in Bassidore since troops were withdrawn in 1883. Concerning alleged Russian designs upon Kishm, please refer to my Persia, Volume II, page 413, fifteenth line. Count Mouravieff contradicted the report declaring that Russia did not intend to add lo the burden of outlying stations or ports. The Sadr Azam also denied the report. (ii) Question of farther repairs to the Government buildings and improving the Rifle Range at Bassidore. 266. In 1892 Rs. 42-14-4 were spent for repairs of the buildings at Bassidore. The question of repairing these buildings was raised by the Resident again in 1900. The Government of India asked External a., August 1900, N03.63-66. him to report on the existing state of the buildings and to state whether, in his opinion, it was desirable, on political grounds, to prevent them from falling entirely into ruin and as to whether this could be done at a small outlay. 267. The following was the report sub mitted by the Resident:— External B,, March 1890, Nos. 14-16. Secret E., Aiigust igoi, Nos, 34-4 3 « No. 41, dated Bushire, the 23rd February 190X. From-LiEUTBNANT.CoLONEi.C. A. K bmball, Officiating Political Residsnt in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to invite a reference to your letter No. 1268-E.A., dated 19th June 1900, regarding the Government buildings at Bassidore. 2. Lieutenant Hunt has recently visited Bassidore and has forwarded to me the following information on the subject • The Government buildings at Bassidore are as follows (1) Dwelling -house by pier, two storied with verandahs. This house is known as Maior Smith's house. It is in a somewhat better condition than the other buildings at Bassidore but two of the verandahs have fallen, and the north wail is partly ruined and is rapidly giving way. The beams ol the ceiling of the lower floor are rotting and some have given way. Lieutenant Hunt states it as his opinion that this house could be repaired, but owing to the noor Quality ol the original construction and owing to the site which is on a sma cli some 15 o q r 20 feet above die sea being threatened by the sea which is gradually under mining the cliff, he thinks that repairs to this house should not be undertaken. (2) Workshop. The walls are standing, but the roof has completely fallen m. It contains an old turning lathe and the remain s of a forge. Gulf Precis, ,80,-*853, paragraph. ^39.84 (3) Bungalow of same plan as Major Smith's house, situated about i of a mile south west of it. This house is in ruins and is not worth repairing. The flagstaff is placed near this house and is in good condition. {4) House formerly occupied by the Assistant Surgeon is completely ruined. (5) House and store rooms formerly occupied by the late Khudadad, the old contrac tor, in ruins, with the exception of two small store-rooms. (6) A small barrack for the native guard, in a bad state of decay, roofs fallen in and walls going. (7) A serai with five rooms and a kitchen. This has been put in good repairs by the Agent for travellers; it consists of 5 small rooms and verandah and has a kitchen attached. It is only suitable for natives. (8) Three or reservoirs for rain water. These measure about 60'long by 8' broad and are 10 deep. They are in good repair and were full at the time of Lieutenant Hunt's visit. Lieutenant Hunt's opinion is that onlv one of the Government'buildings above describ ed is at all capable of repair, namely, tbe house known as Major Smith's house. The buildings were originally of very poor construction, being of stone set in mud. The Agent and the puttawala live in their own quarters which do not belong to Govern ment, about ^ mile from the flagstaff and from the pier. 3. With reference to your request for an expression of my opinion as to whether it is desirable on political grounds to prevent the buildings from falling entirely into ruin, I have the honour to observe that, in my opinion, such political rights as we may have at Bassidore are sufficiently maintained by the presence of our Native Agent at the place with a flagstaff which is standing and in good repair. I can see no object in keeping in repair buildings which have not been occupied for many rears, and which are not likely ever to be occupied again, and in any case the state of the buildings, as described by Lieut enant Hunt, appears to be such that it will be hardly worth while to repair them. 268. The Government of India agreed with the Resident that in the circum stances for the time being, no steps need be taken to repair the buildings (No. 671-E. A., dated 29th April 1901). 269. It was reported by the Resident that the Coal Agent used to fly the Secret E., August 1901, Nos. 34-43. British flag at Bassidore on Sundays and holidays and also on the arrival of any ship. The Government of India ordered that the British flag should be flown at Bas sidore every day from sunrise to sunset (Telegraph dated 14th June 1901). 270. With reference to some proposals put forward by Commander Phillipps Secret e ., July 1503, Nos. 42-48. ^ t ^ e Sp' 1 ™* in March 1901, for improving A 1 . 1 T5 . ,,0, naval rifle range at Bassidore, Rear Admiral Bosanquet instructed the Senior Naval Officer : . ? lt is not considered advisable at present for political reasons to take any new action in this respect or to undertake any new work which would seem to indicate anv special activity on our part, but you should take care as far as possible to unobstrusively main- tain and renew all .he old and customary signs of our connection with and usage of, Bas- a f in 0r ! er f at our n bts and title there ma y no t at any future time be challenged. Any stores therefore which are necessary to maintain the range on its present footing should if possible be provided by the ships using it as has hitherto been the case. ' (iii) Limits of the Bassidore Station. 271. The Government of India addressed the following instructions to the Ibid, No. 43. Resident as to the intended residence of guese settlement at Bassidore PerSian 0fficialS What is Ca ' ed the PortU ' No. 1112.E.A., dated Simla, the 9th July igoi. From J. B. Wood, Esq., Under Secretary to the Government of India, Foriegn Department, lo—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Persian representative oF on . tbe *7^ june iqoi , you mention that a paid two visits to Bassidore ind ih M ^ I ? ,nistl , atl ° n of Persian customs has recently t ' v0v,sits t0 Bassidore, and that he informed the Coal Agent there that his object was8S merely to see the place, and to station a man in old Bassidore, with a view to the seizure of arms and ammumt.on which might be landed there from native vessels, a. It is assumed that by the expression ' old Bassidore ' is meant the ruins of the For- * Vidt Curzon 's Persia, Volume II, page 412. tuguese Settlement^* which once existed upon .... j . north-western extremity of the island of Kishm and near which are located the existing buildings that belong to the Government of India. 1 he records of the Government of India do not indicate the exact limits of the tract at Bassidore which was granted to the British Government by the Sultan of Maskat in 1820, but obviously the grant must have included the old Portuguese Settlement at Bassidore, for at that time no other place was known by that name. You should therefore let it be known that no official of the Persian Government can be permitted to reside in any part of the station without the express consent of the British Government. 272. The Resident was unable to ascertain from the records of the Residency that the limits of the tract at Bassidore, considered to be British territory, had ever been exactly defined. From enquiries, which he made, it appears that old Bassidore is a village situated in close proximity to the old Portuguese fort, and that this village of ' old Bassidore, ' together with another village called ' Singow ' or ' Bandar Sing ' situated also in close proximity to the Portuguese fort, were, in former days, considered to be within the limits of our station of which they are in the immediate vicinity. It appears, however, that more recently we have considered these places to be without our jurisdiction and within that of the Shaikh of Kishm. In 1864, a case occurred in which a slave was enticed from the Bassidore station and taken to Singow, where he was ill-treated. In the correspondence which ensued, the Slave Agent was reproved by the Acting Resident for having interfered in the case and was told that Singow was beyond the limits of British jurisdiction. This appears to have been in accordance with a ruling by Colonel Pelly, the Resident at the time. 273. In 1874 a letter was addressed by Assistant Surgeon A. R. Hakim, then in charge of the Bassidore station, to Colonel Ross, recommending the headman of the Bassidore village (presumably the same as old Bassidore) for compensation on account of the loss of his boat while employed in coaling. The Bassidore village is alluded to in his letter as being without our jurisdiction. 274. It appeared then, so far as the Resident was able to find out from the records, and from inquiries made by him from our Coal Agent at Bassidore that, for many years past, the villages in the immediate proximity of the Bassidore station had not been considered to be within our jurisdiction, which only included the actual site occupied by our buildings. This, however, does not show that they were not within the limits of the tract originally granted to the British Government by the Sultan of Maskat in 1820, and the Resident was inclined to think that they should now be considered to form apart of the British settlement, notwithstanding the fact that the jurisdiction over them for many years past of the Chief of Kishm has not been disputed by us. (Resident's report No. 171, dated 31st September 1901.) The Government of India expressed the following opinion on this report [No. 1858 -E. A., dated the 29th October 1901 (Con fidential) ] :— u It is understood that, while Persian officials have exercised jurisdiction over old Bassidore for some time past, the settlement at Singow has hitherto remained indepen dent of Persian control. In the circumstances the Government of India consider that whatever may have been the original limits of the tract which was granted to the British Government in 1820—-as to which there appears to be no information readily available—they are debarred from asserting a claim to jurisdiction over old Bassidore by the prescrip tion of many years. The site of the abandoned settlement at Singow may, however, be regarded as included within the limits of the British station,' 275. With his letter No. 38, dated 23rd February 1902, Colonel Kemball forwarded two tracings taken from the Secret E., July 1902, Nos. 513-5*4- chart of the station and its surroundings. (iy) Proposed ecnigration of Bu Snisit tribe from Lingah to Bassidore, i8q7'I90I- 276. In March 1897 certain members of the Bu Smeit tribe emigrated from Lingah to Bassidore on account of some quar- Secret E„ jane 190!, Nos. ai.aa. re j Persian authorities at Lingah, C645FD86 and from Bassidore addressed a letter to the resident asking to be allowed to live there and to be taken under British protection. No reply was sent to their letter and they apparently returned to Lmgah In '9 00 a ar g e number of the tribe wished to emigrate to Bassidore and got the Chief of Bahrein to write to the Res.- dent on the iubject. Colonel Kemball thought that it would be inadvisable to offer the tribe any encouragement to come to Bassidore. He therefore decided not to reply to the Chief, but if he referred to the matter again the Resident pro- posed to reply that the fact of this tribe emigrating to Bassidore would not make any change in their nationality. 277 From a report, dated 12th January 190 1, of the Resident it appears that the A1 Bu Smelt originally inhabited a place called Tinbit in the vicinity of Khor Shagig in Katar and in the latter part of the eighteenth century they joined the A! Khali- fah faction of the Allubis at Zobara where they resided until about 1810, m which ^|-j0y removed to Jou in Bahrein, About 20 years later, in consecjuence of a blood -feud arising between them and the Niaim tribe of Bahrein, they emigrated to Damam, a place about 10 miles below Katif. At Damam they appear to have remained about seven years and then returned to Bahrein for a short period, and subsequently emigrated in about 1840 to Lingah where they have been residing to this day. 278. The tribe rendered assistance to Sheikh Muhammad bin Khalifah against the Persians in February 1899 when Lingah was re-taken by the Darya Begi. After the capture of Lingah the Darya Begi, it appears, inflicted a heavy fine on the tribe for their participation in the rebellion, and the tribe decided to emigrate to the Arab coast, as they feared the Persians would increase the annual tax payable by them on their pearling boats. The Darya Begi hearing of their intentions, he gave their chief Yousef bin Ahmad assurances to the effect that the tax would not be raised and they would not be further interfered with. 279. The Lingah authorities appear to have waived the assurances given by the Darya Begi in 1899, and either levied or demanded a heavier tax than the tribe had been accustomed to pay, and for this reason they desired to emigrate to Bassidore where they hoped to be out of the reach of Persian exactions. (v) Desire of Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdullah bin Mether of Jezirat Sheikh Shuaib to emigrate to Bassidore, 1902. 280. In November 1901 this Chief addressed a letter to the Assistant Political , . „ L „ Agent. Bahrein, stating that the ancestors External A., March iq02, Nos. 21 *32. r &amp; 1 . ' 111 1 ••11 of his tribe had been once domiciled at Shargah, but had emigrated about 50 years ago to the island of Jezirat Sheikh and that they now wished to settle at Bassidore under British protection, appoint ing an agent to look after this property at the island. His kinsmen numbered about 15 persons. 281. Colonel Kemball was of opinion that the emigration at that juncture of a large number of Persian subjects to Bassidore might give rise to undesirable complications without any corresponding advantage trom our point of view. He therefore instructed the Assistant Political Agent to inform Sheikh Ahmed, if he referred to the matter again, that the facts of his emigrating to Bassidore would not affect his status as a Persian subject so far as his properties situated within the Persian territories was concerned, and desired that no encouragement whatever should be offered to the Sheikh. (vi) Proposed British trading settlement at Bassidore, 1902. 282. In March 1902 Colonel Kemball reported that two Baniahs had asked Secret e., July 1902, Nos. 42-48. permission to land 10,000 bags of rice at Bassidore and build a godown near the landing place. He had previously instructed the Coal*Agent that he was not to prevent any British subjects from settling there if they wished to do so, and he now proposed to write to him that he must inform any settlers there that they must understand that any buildings which they might erect must be of a tempo rary nature, and if thev wished to settle at the place they must inform the Resident of their wishes and requirements, so that steps might be taken to allot sites to them.r 87 282-A. The Government of India approved of these instructions on the as sumption that they applied to British subjects (letter No. 926-E.A,, dated 7th May 1902). (vii) Immigration of Persian subjects to Bassidore, 1905. 283. In his letter No. 169, dated 7th April 1905, Major Cox pointed out that „ „ _ T the instructions which were issued by Colo- Secret E.% May 1905, Nos. S7 6 -579. i t /' u n • ft A nel Kemball in 1902 (referred to in the Foreign Department letter No. 926-E.A., dated 7th May 1902) were intended to apply to subjects of any nationality, not merely to British subjects. Major Cox found on a visit to Bassidore on 6th April 1905, besides our own Seedi com munity, several Persians living in huts on the sea-shore within our limits. The Coal Agent informed him that there was a natural inclination on the part of poor Persians wishing to avoid oppression from their own officials to emigrate to the British settlement at Bassidore and that it was difficult for him to keep them away. Major Cox proposed to issue instructions to our Agent at Bassi dore to discourage non-British immigrants as far as possible, and to report to the Residency the arrival of any new settlers, British or foreign, who erect huts or appear to be more than passing visitors. 283-A. The Government of India approved of Major Cox's proposal (No. 1739-E., dated 9th May 1905). (viii) Refusal of the Moin-ut-Tujjar's request to be allowed to store red ochre at Bassidore, 1905. 284. Moin-ut-Tujjar is a leading Persian merchant, working mainly on the interests of the Persian Government who So^vut'p.'»'• 403-4'6, and whose ancestors have been playing of -Persian Coasts and Islands Precis, 1854 1905. an important r6le in the artairS OI the Paragraph 85 -B, ante. Persian Gulf. Recently he made a request for permission to store red ochre at our station in Bassidore. The corres pondence on the subject, throwing as it does much light on the doings of this man and our policy with reference to Bassidore, is printed below: No. 295, dated Bushire, the 25th June (reed. 3rd July) 1905). From-MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E ., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 1 o -S. M. Fraser , Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour toreferto Foreign Department letter No. 1739^ dated 9th May f No. 577 in ,905, regarding immigration into British Bassidore, and to enclose copies of correspondence Secret E..^ which has passed between His Majesty s Minister and myself on the subject of a reques Nos . S76 . 5;9 . by the Moin-et-Tujjar to store red ochre in our station. I trust the Government of India will generally concur in the views which I have expressed. I feel convinced that neither the Moin-et-Tujiar nor his^ red ochre (which the wind assists to envelope everything within range with its crimson dust) can conveniently be admitted to the hospitality of our small colony at Bassidore. . , , The Goyernment of India are probably familiar with the general history and character of the Moin ; but should this not be the case I shall feel happy to furnish a note on the subject.

I visited the station in due course on 6th April, and found that in the meanwhile some of the community of manumitted Africans who live in peace at Bassidore under the aegis of our flag having threatened to cut his throat, the Customs official had discontinued his unwelcome visits. I had therefore simply to give our Agent instructions for the future and did so in the sense of my draft above mentioned. In the course of my visit to the station I found a number of poor Persians living in huts at Singao within our limits and was informed by the Agent that they had migrated from old Bassidore or other parts of Kishm owing to the oppression of the Customs officials on the Island. Seeing objection to an influx of Persians into our station, both on account of the narrow limits of it, as well as because their taking refuge there was likely to bring us into collision with the Persian Customs, I addressed the Government of India on the subject and attach copies of my communication and of their reply (lately received).

This was the position when I received Your Excellency's telegram No. 40 of 35th April, and at the moment I was naturally somewhat on the qui vive regarding Bassidore affairs. Referring to the question of storage of red ochre by the Moin, on its superficial merits, I would mention that the last application of the kind was one from Sheikh Hassan of Kishm in March 1902, in connection with the storage of salt. My predecessor, Colonel Kemball, did not consider that he was in a position to forbid him to land his salt on our station, but directed our Agent to ' inform Sheikh Hassan in a friendly manner that as a Persian subject and moreover as a Persian official he is likely to give offence to his superiors ******** ♦ * * and it seems against interests to act as he proposes and he would be well advised not to do so.' Before the communication reached Sheikh Hassan, hovever, he had already landed some salt on our station. Regarding this salt, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bandar Abbas, writing to Colonel Kemball a year later, stated that although Sheikh Hassan had already paid duty on this salt, before it left the salt mine, the Director of Customs, Bandar Abbas, was trying to get another lot of duty out of him, on the grounds that Bassidore was Persian territory. Considering the facts that I had before me, I trust Your Excellency will understand my chariness to agree to the Moin landing his red ochre on British Bassidore. Since receipt of Your Excellency's last telegram No. 46 of 4th May, I have received a further communication from our Coal Agent dated 1st June forwarding for information a copy of letter addressed to him by Sheikh Hassan of Agent, Kishm. I attach a copy of the latter, and of llth my reply to the Coal Agent. Apart from the general reasons mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, the personality of the Moin-et- Tujjar also entered to some extent into my calculations when replying to Your Excellency's inquiry. _ The ubiquitous vested interests which he has systematically created in these regions during the past few years, either in his own name or that of the Malek-et-Tujjar, whose henchman he was, must be well known to Your Excellency, and their existence has been inconveniently in evidence of late in connection with more than one question affecting our interests. For instance : (1) At Ahwaz he has recently claimed rights over the site which we were trying to lease from the Sheikh of Mohammerah for the erection of a Consulate. (2) At Henjam he has a heap of salt and a hut in our limits, of which we shall probably hear more. He is also responsible for the erection of the old flagstaff on our plinth which has been the cause of so much correspondence. (3) It is he, I imagine, who is the cause of the protraction of the case of the date gardens of the Shargah family at Lingah. In fact, wherever he obtains a footing he seems to stay and to encroach. Just now he apparently holds an abnormally stcong position both with the Customs and with the Darya Begi, and I am informed that he possesses good deal of influence at Tehran. He is the landlord of the Bushire Customs, and this no doubt brings him into close tmch with them, but apart from that, according to my information he is verv strongly backed by the Department from Monsieur Naus downwards, and I am told that the suuordinates have explicit orders to give his Agents and his operations all possible From Sheikh Hassan of Kishm to Coal Bassidore, dated 17th May 1905. From Resident to Coal Agent, dated June 1905. Tov ''pi 89 assistance. Again the Darya Begi who used to be his bitter enemy is believed to have come to an understanding with hun and to be working in his interests. It is in fact a matter of common report here that it was the Moin who undertook to bring about the Darya Begis return to Bushire as Governor on condition that the latter furthered the Moin's business and designs within his province. My information concerning him may not be accurate in all particulars, but I think t ere is^ no doubt or the fact that both the Customs and Darya Begi are doing their utmost to keep in his good books. Whether this is with the idea of placating a potential enemy or in execution of any particular line of Persian policy, of which the Moin is the instru- mentj I am unable to say and shall be grateful if Your Excellency can enlighten me, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Excelleney's most obedient, humble servant, P.

Persian subjects have hitherto been dis couraged by us from using our Bassidore station in this way, and it seemed that the Moin especially was a person to whom it was desirable our narrow limits should not afford a footing. During a recent visit to Bassidore I noticed that the Persian subjects were inclined to take^efuge from Customs oppression within our limits. I addressed Govern, ment of India on' 3 the question, and before making any new departure, should prefer to wait until they have considered it. In the event, however, of Your Excellency considering the present matter important or urgent, I would refer it to the Government of India for an expression of their views. C645FD90 Telegram P.

From—The Coal Agent, Bassidore, To—The Resident, Bushire. On 18th and 20th Dil Hijjah Seyyid Eraz Dashti accompanied by 7 men arrived at Old Bi s;idore and urged upon the Katkhuda of that place to act according to the orders of the man who had been stationed there by the Customs Mudir (of Lingah or Bunker Abbas ?) and that he should proclaim on Fridays in the mosques to the villagers that they should land at Old Bassidore any cargoes which they may bring for British Bassidore. Their object is that if we bring any provisions from Debai they should be landed at Old Bassidore, so that they may do as they wish with them and cause us inconvenience. I have several times urged on the man appointed to Bassidore by the ^ Mudir not to intrude in the territory of the British Government, but he does not give up his habit. The conduct of these men this year is prompted by the wish to cut communication between British Bassidore and Lingah. Under these circumstances it will be difficult if the Government pay no attention to us. Bassidore is not so important that a Mudir should be appointed, every boat should take her cargo to its proper destination (not to Old Bassidore). Draft reply dated i6th June 1905. Your letter of 28th February 1905 has been received. The Customs man has no right to stop vessels and people who may wish to visit British Bassidore.

The Agent assures me that he has no intention of building godowns, etc. On pressing Vim for a reason it appeared that he hopes to evade all the vexatious formalities and stamp fees of the Customs post at Hormuz, which must be heavy indeed to make it worth his while to transport the red oxide of iron (on which there is no export duty) from Hormuz to Bassidore and then ship it thence. I save the Agent no hope of his request being granted, as to my mind further diffi culties would certainly arise in the near future with the Customs Department, perhaps similar to those at Henjam, apart from the fact that we do not desire to be parties to an obvious fraud on the Persian Government, nor to give any grounds for a possible question being raised regarding thenature of our rights at Bassidore. I propose therefore inform- ing the Agent that this request cannot be granted. ■^Tn^Torrespondence with Coal Agent ' Bassidore » always-' British bassidore •' as noosed to old Bassidote.

The Government of India then gave orders to the Director of the Royal Indian Marine to make arrangements to carry out the survey of the Persian Gulf during cold weather of 1901-02. A chart of the Bahrein waters was made by the R.I.M.S. Investigator in 1902. 287. In December 1901 Colonel Kemball suggested that a survey should External P. April . 5 o., Ko.. .38-,45.

On 9th January 1902, the Secretary of State, however, telegraphed that it was desirable to postpone the survey, as in the circumstances then existing, the measure might give rise to fresh rumours as to our intentions. 288. The question of the acceleration of the mail steamer service in the Secret E., June 1903. Nos, 387-291. Gulf being under consideration. Colonel Kemball suggested in September 1902 the survey of the Clarence Strait (in the hope that it might shorten the route to Lingah), Bassidore and Bushire. His Excellency Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Drury did not think the survey of the Clarence Strait and Bassidore necessary, as the former was not deep enough for vessels drawing more than 18 feet at low water and could not be used without being buoyed and lighted, and the latter would require dredging a channel 11 miles long to make it available for vessels of large draught ; he approved of the suggestion for surveying the Bushire harbour. 289. While the question of surveying the Bushire harbour was under consi- -WiV, No. 289. deration, the Resident in February 1903 c ... , 1 . , , . reported that the Commander of the sphinx had raised the question of survey of the Koweit harbour. 290. The Government of India then submitted both the proposals to the Secretary of State, and requested that the Shah's permission might be obtained as regards Bushire, and as our intentions towards Koweit had now been declared the Resident might be authorized to obtain Sheikh Mubarak's consent as to Koweit. The Secretaty of State sanctioned both the proposals. 290. The Persian Government asked and were given an assurance that the ^Seoret E., February 1905. Nos. 753-802 (No. proposed survey of the Bushire foirbour /t? • would not entail any project for deepeningf the same (Foreign Department telegram, dated 13th October 1904).

Lord Curzon and Rear-Admiral Atkinson Willes had examined this Khor during their visit to Koweit, the -result of which was the despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 25, dated 4th February 1904, in (see Kowett Precis, Chapter XXXV). Our ships had also on several occasions recently visited the Khor, and in August 1904 Commander Kemp had for- ibid, No. 759, warded sketches showing the result of the . observations taken by the Sphinx in the Khor during a recent visit. The Government of India considered the survey very desirable and asked the Secretary of State to know whether there were any serious objections to the proposal. The survey would be conducted without unnecessary parade and would stop several miles short of the Turkish port at Umkasr, and as we claim an equal right of access to the Khor as the Turks, the Government of India did not think that Turkish objections need prevent the work being undertaken (Viceroy's telegram to the Secretary of State, dated 19th August i904)» 294* Sir N. O'Conor thought that much could not be gained by abstaining Secret E,, February 1905, Nos. 1491-1523 (No. from surveying the Khor Abdulla and the ,494 ^ Bubyan island channel out of a compla cency to Turkey, while on the other hand having in mind the disputed owner ship of the island, we should, if anything, gain something by making evident to the Turks our views in regard to that question (Despatch, dated 19th September 1904). 395. Thehowever, returned in December 1904 to Bombay without making a survey of the Koweit Harbour, owing to the outbreak of beri-beri among the crew. 296. It was sent again in March 1905. In the first instance under instruc tions from the Government of India, Marine Department, the officer in charge of the Marine Survey of India submitted in April 1905 a report on the position and requirements of a protected boat harbour at Koweit, which concludes with the opinion that the necessity for a protected boat harbour available at all times of tide does not appear to be so pressing as when Commander Kemp made his suggestions. A shelter fulfilling these requirements would entail the extension of the existing boat harbours 400 yards seaward, and improving the construction of the walls which would make them costly in comparison to the trade of the Port. A well sheltered harbour already exists at a distance if a or 3 miles from Koweit which could be used by boats and, if properly marked, by ships of moderate draught. A survey of the Koweit harbour bay was made in the months of March and April. A number of flags had to be planted Secret E., December 1905, Nos. 271-259. j ..u u r u* i Secret e.] January 1906.

The British Ambassador ex plained the real purpose of planting the flags. (ii) Survey of KhorKaliya. 297. The Government of India also thought it necessary that a survey should e 0 be made of KhorKaliya, a lagoon to the Secret E„ Febmay 1905, Nos. 759-808. southward of the Muharrak island, which from a note of Mr. J. G. Lorimer, dated 10th August 1904, appeared to possess, possibilities of a good harbour. The Redbreast was accordingly ordered by the Naval Commander-in- Secret E., February 1905, Nos. 1491*1522.

In a report submitted by Commander Somervllle, dated 1st February 1905, he sums up the advantages and dis- Secret e ., December ,905. no s . 271-299. advantages of Khor Kaliya as follows ;— I.—Advantages— (a) Entry defended. (b) Secure from torpedo attack. (c) Perfectly sheltered. II.—D isad vantages— (^z) Very costly to dredge (even if possible). (^) Difficult entrance. (c) Poor holding ground. The latter appear to preponderate, and unless no other port were available, Khor Kaliya is little fitted for any larger establishment than a torpedo station on account of the expense it would entail. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief holds also that Khor Kaliya will not be of use as a naval base (No. 1462, dated 2nd March 1905). The only results of the survey of the Khor, was the conversion of the cavin erected as a mark for navigators during the survey, into a permanent beacon. (iii) Report on Khor Musa. 299.

The India Office and Foreign Office concurred in this proposal. [We have referred to already to the harbours indenting into the Mussandtm peninsula (see Chapter ) Khor Kaliya and Khor Abdulla.] 300. Attention has been drawn to the advantages, which Khor Musa possesses for a naval basis.

Assuming an attempt by Russia to acquire a maritime post towards the upper end of the Gulf, it was feared that her attention might not improbably be called to Khor Musa. She might find here that outlet to the sea for a railway descending from the high lands in the interior of Persia which is understood to be one of the objects of her ambition, and a harbour so constructed would certainly be well sheltered from marine attack. No doubt these advantages would be largely neutralised by a British occupation, as already recommended by the Government of India, of the Hormuz-Kishm position at the entrance to the Gulf ; and one of their main reasons for so strongly insisting upon the importance of that position is the effect that we should thereby be able to exercise upon the movements of a Power seek ing an interior rather than an exterior base in Persian waters. 302. It is also conceivable that in certain conditions Khor Musa might be useful to ourselves. Should it be thought necessary at any time to occupy or support Mohammerah, and should the ascent of the Shat-el-Arab for any reasons be found inconvenient, a base for advance might be found here, the strategic value of which would be enhanced by the proximity of the mountain country of the Lur and Bakhtiari tribes, to which we have always looked to oppose a barrier to Rusaian advance from the north or north-east. There is yet another contin gency in which Khor Musa might play a part in the political developments of the future. Though it does not seem likely at present that these will include the „ , , _ construction of a British railway in the Secret Ju y 1904, 05.420-432. south-west corner of the Persian dominions, it is worth while to know that a possible maritime outlet for such a project exists, which may be worthy of more detailed consideration in circumstances that cannot at present be foreseen. For all these reasons the Government of India com mended to the attention of His Majesty's Government the features of a place that seems to us to possess strategic and possibly commercial capabilities of no mean order. (Despatch No. 71, dated 24th March 1904). 303. The Secretary of State expressed concurrence with the Government of India in their estimate of the importance Secret E., July 1904, Nos.420-432.

If there is anything more than another that is attractive in the Persian Gulf, it is its pearl fisheries. It is for this reason more than perhaps than any other apart from its importance as a high way of commerce, that the Persian Gulf has been one of the most coveted regions of the earth, As guardians of the Maritime peace of the Gulf for more than a century and protectors of the Arab tribes on the Pirate Coast and of the Chief of Bahrein, there have devolved upon us obligations to protect their rights in the pearl fisheries, such as they are usage against foreign encroachments.* 305. The first agreement for truce signed in 1835 ky the Pirate Chiefs was Section XLiu oi the Persian Guff freds (i8oi- for the period of the pearl fishing season. i8 53)« They agreed that from 21st May 1835 to 21 st November 1835 there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between their subjects and dependents and an inviolable truce should be established during which the Chiefs' claims upon one another should rest in abeyance. The advantages of this truce were found to be so great, that it was renewed every year. The periodical truce was soon converted into an annual one and ultimately in 1853 into a Treaty of Perpetual Peace. 306. But the truces could not be enforced without the vigilance of the East India Company's navy and our officers in the Gulf. In fact the maritime peace on the Arab Coast, was maintained at immense sacrifice by the British Govern ment, for which their only reward was the security of trade in the Gulf and especially of the diving operations during the pearl fishing seascn, the benefit of which has mainly accrued to the Arab divers and boatmen and the Indian Baniahs who have been financing the industry. That the Arabs should continue to enjoy their benefits is of the highest importance: we have forced them from piratical enterprises into peaceful avocations among which the most important is that of pearl fishing. 1 hey enjoy a practical monopoly of this industry; to deprive them of it, would entail on them direct impoverishment and misery. 1 his accounts for the care with which we have been guarding their interests from foreign encroachments. 307.

J. and W, v\ atson Oi Bombay requested to be informed if British subjects could by right or sufferance, engage in pearl fishing in common with the subjects of the maritime chiefs of the Persian Gulf. . 3°^* opinion of Commander Felix Jones, who was consulted on the subject, was as follows (letter dated 16th June 1857) With reference to the subject of your letter No. 2003, and its enclosure, I have the honour to state, for the information of the Right Hon'ble His Lordship in Council, that I do not conceive British subjects have any right to fish for pearls on the fishing grounds of the maritime tribes in the Persian Gulf. By sufferance they might indeed be permitted to do so. It would, however, I think, necessitate stipulations and agreements between parties which, on the Arab part, would e roken at all times, unless indeed the British Government is prepared to maintain a permanent force on the fishing grounds in the event of the project being carried out on an extended scale. I am of opinion, too, that British capitalists would not be able to compc e t e Banyas, and other native traders now monopolizing the fisheries in eir OWI ^ an s, an it is certain that plunder, if not bloodshed, would result to inex perience par ics a e outset of operations in the sea.

In the year 1862 a private company comprising among its members Political A., July 51863, Nos. 40-41. British and Native Indian subjects, suddenly AUr^r* n „A • sc v • , C0mmence ^ diving operations, with trained divers and scientific appliances, in the Pearl Banks near Bahrein without any reference to Government or the Residency. The^ organizer of these operations was ne Mr, Plunkett and an Arab Baghla belonging to a Turkish Arabian sub- gct was made use .of by the divers. Captain Disbrowe, Officiating Political esident in the Persian Gulf, at once took steps to stop the operation. He also wrote to Cdonel A. B. Kemball, Resident at Baghdad, proposing to convey in custody the Turkish boat to Basrah. r r j 311. The Resident at Baghdad was of opinion that he could take no action in regard to the Baghla, which the Ottoman authorities would have regarded as pursuing a lawful occupation. He expressed the opinion that the only way to save the Arab tribes, who were mainly dependent for subsistence upon pearl fishing, from foreign aggression was for the Supreme Government to regard the Persian Gulf as a more clausum for purposes of pearl diving to all parties coming from ports or coasts situated beyond its limits and to refuse protection by proclamation accordingly to such parties, whatever their nationality. 312. The Government of Bombay, approved of Captain Disbrowe's proceed ings and observed that the view taken by Colonel Kemball as to our general rights and liabilities and the best course to be followed, should Mr. Plunkett's experi ment be repeated, would be the correct one, and that while we are bound to use our influence to prevent lawlessness and bloodshed arising out if fishing disputes, we must be very careful not to involve ourselves in responsibilities for the- protection of the fishery which might lead to the infringement of the rights either of the Arab tribes or of other nations. 313. They wished to have a report as to the extent of the fishing grounds, their boundaries and rights, the method of settling disputes, etc. At the same time it should be made to clear to the Arab tribes that our object is to protect them from any unauthorized unfringement of their rights by British subjects and not to extend our authority over them. (Letter to Colonel Pelly, dated 8th December 1862.) 314. Colonel Pelly, however, deprecated any enquiry into these questions, especially since where written law does not obtain and where all rights and boundaries are determined by an appeal to custom, to rough occupancy or to arms, the definition of rights and boundaries in the sense in which we understand definition must be a delicate proceeding. He summed up as follows :— ' On the whole, and practically the best course we can follow for the present is, perhaps, to keep quiet: the fisheries are probably in the hands of those who can make them pay best; if they be not, sooner or later competition will appear; meantime we have done all we can, and have done a great deal, in checking outrage by sea, in softening the Arab vengeance, and in excluding our own subjects from perilous enterprise. ,, 315. The Bombay Government then suggested that the enquiry might be entered upon as a matter of history, without exciting any surprise or alarm on the part of those interested in the pearl banks. 316. Colonel Kemball also wrote to the Government of Bombay discussing Political a„ January 1864, Nos. 1 -3. the ^tion, and wrote as regards the extent and ownership of the banks ' Strictly speaking, no boundaries, as comprising or defining territorial rights, can be assigned to the pearl banks : these banks, distinguished only as deep and shallow, have with one exception been confessedly open to all the tribes.' C645FD9 8 ,,7. The exception referred to was that of Karrak and Kargo which were considered by the Sheikh of Bushire, the old feudal tnbutary of the Shah as his immediate property and the deep sea fishery around which he mamta.ned as an entire monopoly in his hands. Colonel Kembd at the same t.me seemed to agree with Colonel Pelly that no advantage would be gained by the proposed enquiry, and suggested that any measures we took for the protection of the Arab rights should be on national lines (Colonel Kemball s letter dated 25th July I9O3). The Bombay Government concurred in in the opinion expressed by Colonel Pelly and Colonel Kemball (letter No. 3901, dated 3rd December 1863). ■318 In 1872 the Wali of Baghdad brought out an expert English diver for 0 employment on the pearl banks.

Smith and Co.) proposed to exploit the fisheries. The matter was referred Political a., January 1874. Nds. 333-341. t0 the Government of India by the Secre tary of State for India. The Sheikh of Bahrein refused to grant the firm any concession and declined even to entertain relations with parties unauthorised by the English Government. The firm's representative accordingly abandoned the scheme. 320. While the matter was under consideration Colonel Pelly (then Agent to the Governor-General, Rajputana) was con- Poiiticai A., January 1874, Nos. 333-4t. suited and discussed the question in an interesting letter No, u, dated the 12th December 1873. 321.

The party was not successful and returned to Bombay. 322.

The London Foreign Office informed Mr. Streeter that they were unable to comply with his application for support. 323.

In 1899* it was alleged that a concession for pearl-fishing in the • secret e., june 1899, Nos. 187 -151. Persian Gulf had been granted by the t Secret e., july igoo, Nos. 178-192. Persian Government to Messrs. Raphael Secret e., august ■goo. No. s o 4 . and Auguste Hagens in March of 1898, and later f it was reported to have been renewed by Russian influence in the name of Monsieur Sunye. The Persian Government were informed by the Legation at Tehran that no contract could be recognised which would have the effect of interfering with the rights exercised by Chiefs under British protection, 325. In 1901, in connection with a project which was under the consideration Secret E., January 1901, Nos. i6-3is. ^ the Porte to tax pearl fishers m the it n n r • •• Persian Gulf, Sir Nicolas O'Conor acquaint ed iewfik Pasha with the British Government's objections to the grant of any99 concession for pearl fishers in the Persian Gulf, which would interfere with the prescriptive rights of protected tribes. 326. In the same year a Hindu trader residing at Maskat obtained the per- _ „ . mission of Sheikh Zaid-bin-Kalifah, Chief Secret E., February 1901, Nos. 151-153. r a 1 i-i 1 • . v r i u U of Abu 1 habi, to dive for pearls on a bank situated within the Sheikh's jurisdiction and engaged a member of the Beni Yas tribe to conduct the party to the point. The venture was, however, a failure. In connection with this case the Chief of Bahrein and other Trucial Chiefs expressed the opinion that no Chief had the right to give any such permission as the pearling banks were the common property of the Coast Arabs. 327. In 1902 a British Indian subject desired to lease the Abu Thabi cus toms and obtained a concession for pearl Secret E, August ,90.. Nc S . fishing in Abu Thabi waters: ^ Xhe Ass i st . ant Political Agent at Bahrein pointed out to this man that, since pearling banks were regarded as the common property of the Arab divers, no Chief could grant a concession to any individual to employ modern diving apparatus in pearling operations off the Arabian Coast of the Gulf. 328. Early in 1903 Colonel Kemball reported that two Frenchmen named Dumas and Castelin had arrived at Bahrein with the intention, it was suspected, of prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief however refused to entertain any proposals on the subject. Subsequently Monsieur Dumas' Assist ant proceeded to Marseilles. It was supposed that he had gone to engage a diver. The last report received was to the effect that Mons. Dumas had left Bahrein for Baghdad on account of the plague, but it was presumed that he would return later on. 329. The Government of India entirely approved of the Sheikh's action in the matter and advised that in the event of either of these parties re -appeanng at Bahrein, the Chief should refuse to render the assistance of any description. Colonel Kemball was to advice the other Chiefs also, who might be similarly approached, to return a similar response (letter No. 778-E.-A., dated 9th March 1904). 330. The following despatch (No. 63, dated 10th March 1904) was then addressed to the Secretary of State:-— tf In the course of our recent examinations of problems connected with the Persian Gulf, the question of tbe pea l-fisheries that have so long existed there has come under our notice Important questions, both of policy and international law, are involved; and althcucrh none of these has fortunately hitherto assumed an acute shape it seems to us desirable that the matter should be considered now, in order that we may know how to act should any sudden or unexpected development occur. W e therefore address you on the subject. 2 The approximate limits of the pearling grounds in the neighbourhood of the Arab littoral are indicated on the enclosed copy of a chart of the Gulf in addit.on to those marked ; there are also shoals in the neighbourhood of Kharak Island and at other po.nts along the Persian Coast, which are regularly exploited and frequently^ yield considirable returns. We are immediately concerned, however, only with those lying on the Arabian side of the Gulf, Along this coast lie the territories of the several 1 rue, a I Ch .efs, the peninsula of El Katr, the island of Bahrein, the 1 urkish province of El Hassa, and the domains of the Sheikh of Koweit. The pearl banks appear from time .mmcmorial to have been open, without distinction, to the Arabs of the entire bttoral ; and though there are no definite inter tribal limits, the external boundaries of the fisheries are well known In trusion s rescented; the principal Chiefs have in past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property, and that no Chief has, therefore, the right to grant any con cession to outside parties; and believing as they do that the shallower waters are depend- cession to ouisia p , ^ ^ells, their objections relate not only to interference on the Ihoals which are habitually fished by their dependents, but also to the exploitation of tbe deeper waters beyond. 1 His Maiesty's Government are aware of the close relations which exist between the Arabsof his coast and the Indian Government, b.nce 1843 we have held from he Trucfal Chiefs agreements to rafrain from any breach of the peace at sea, and in .892 the Sheikhs concluded fresh compacts binding themselves not to enter into and agreement or sneiKns conciuu p j ther t i ian the Br tish Government; not to consent, except ^rnment, to the residence within their territories of100 the Agent of any other State; and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give occupa tion of any portion of their territories, save to the British Government. In respect of El Katr we have at present no formal Conventions. We have declined, however, to recog nize Turkish pretensions on the peninsula, and the leading Chief has on mor.e fChan oiTe occasion approached our officers in the Gulf with a request that he may be admited to closer relations with the Indian Government. Bahrein has for long been, to all intents and purposes, a British protectorate ; while in the case of Koweit, though the iurks have laid claim certain ill-defined rights of sovereignty, we have always asserted that the Sheikh ^enjoys a large measure of practical independence, and His Majesty's Government have ■promised him their good officers. The maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gulf is an object which for more than a century past we have steadily kept in view in all our dealings with the Arab tribes. To secure object we have prohjbited the use of armed boats by the Chiefs, iand have taken upon ourselves the duty of policing all these waters. A necessary corollary of .this policy is that the Chiefs cannot themselves adopt forcible measures for the preservation of their monopoly in connection with the pearl -fisheries. It is clear, therefore, that we on our part owe to them an obligation to defend their rights sc far as they can reasonably be substantiated. This duty carries with it incidentally the advantage that, if our right to police the pearl banks is recognised, a large area of the Gulf becomes at once practically British waters. 4.. Inthe past we have on more than one occasion intervened to prevent the intrusion of foreigners, in 1863 a British steamer appeared in the Gulf with trained divers and scientific appliances, but the steps which were at once taken by the .Resident, •witli the approval of the Bombay Government, sufficed to frustrate the attempted enrraachment In 1874, and again m 1890, His Majesty's Government, on the advice of the Government of India, declined to countenance proposals made by British companies to exploit the fisheries. In 1894 support was refused to an application by a British subject to the Per sian Government for pearling concessions in the Gulf, In ^99, in connection with the a 5 e P Pu ant &lt; ^ ta,n F'^ 168 ^ 10 t w 0 'Europeans by the Persian .Government, Mushir- ed-Dowleh was informed by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran that no contract couW be recognised which would have the effect of interfering with the rights exercised by Chiefs under Bntish protection. In 1901 Sir Nicolas O'Conor, hearing of a project which was nK ^ ^ co^i^^tion of the ,port^to tax the fisheries,,acquainted Tewfik Pasha with the objections which Her late Majesty s Government saw to any action which would interfere with the prescriptive rights of our protected tribes. In 1902 our local officers declined to countenance the project of a British Indian subject, who proposed to obtain fadlUies for pearling in Abu Dhabi waters. Finally, 1903, Colonel KembaH rennrfS Iw two Frenchmen, named Dumas and Castelin, had arrived in Bahrein with the intention of prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief refused to entertain tS nro- ■nay be similarly approached should return a sim7ar resnonse 'and tLT °' her r Chlef who of India should at once be informed of any renewal of the p?o'ec t ir of any i k e attemB^Te enclose, for your .nformat.on, a copy of the recent correspondence on this subject.

In the pearl-fisheries of Ceylon we S101 jurisdiction beyond the 3-m.ile limit under the Colonial Act of 1811, which authorises the seizute and condemnation of any boat found within the limits of, or hovering near, the pearl banks extending from 6 or 21 miles from the coast, and it may be observed that, in the recent Behring Sea Arbitration, the United States of America cited the Ceylon precedent as justifying their exercise of possession in, and control over, seal-fisheries beyond the zone of territorial waters as ordinarily recognised by international law. It is also worth nothing that the above contention is supported bv the authority of the Swiss publicist, Vettel, who in bis ' Droit des Gens ' remarked, in discussing the question as far back as the eighteenth century, ' Qui doutera que less pecheries de perles de Behrein et de Ceylon ne puissent le^itimement tomber en properiete? ' We believe, therefore, that our claim to exclude all foreign pearling vessels from the limits of the fisheries at present worked by the tribes within our protectorate might, if challenged, be defended with a reasonable chance of success. 6. There remains, however, the case of foreign exploitation of deep waters outside the sphere in which we believe that it may be shown that immemorial usage and occu pation have conferred prescriptive rights. In this still wider area we doubt whether we possess claims in support of which could appeal to any law or international practice, and we fear that possible detriment to the pearl banks in which we hold prescriptive rights would furnish no valid ground for objecting to legitimate foreign enterprise outside the sphere of Arab occupation ; but by authorising the Chiefs to abstain from all intercourse wiih such interlopers and to utilise the powers which they possess of interdict ing the importation foreign diving appliances, of refusing to. lend any assistance in men, boats or in any other form, or, if necessary in the last resort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories, we might succeed in putting such serious impediments in the way of such enterptises as would discourage outsiders from engaging in them. 7. The question is fortunately not one in which we are at present called upon to decide as to the exact nature of the rights or the precise limits of jurisdiction which the several Chiefs possess, and which we, as the paramount Power, are bound to assert and maintain on their behalf; but in view of the possibility of further attempt, whether by British companies or by foreign capitalists, we think it advisable to be prepared in advance. We shall, therefore, be glad to know whether His Majesty's Government concur in the views above set forth and to receive any instructions which it may be deemed advisable to issue for the guidance of our local officers in the event of renewed adventures of a more determined character. 331. The Secretary of State after consulting the Legal Adviser of the India Office forwarded the case to the Foreign ecrct e, iv arch 1905, os. i-io. Office for taking the advice of the Law Officers of the Crown, with a clear statement of the points. 333. The Law Officers of the Crown have doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as may justly be Secret e., May 1905, Nos. 528 530. considered territorial. Outside territorial warters, they are inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their Exclusive possession is capable oj historical proof, but they consider that the point is not free from doubt. In regard to the deeper waters, they are of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. The Law Officers in the circumstances conclude that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks outside the territorial limits. The object in view may probably be attained by indirect methods. 333. The Secretary of State concurs in the general conclusion of the Law Officers (Despatch No. S^SeC., dated 31st March I9 0 5)' G.
