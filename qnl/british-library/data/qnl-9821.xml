                           Bullfinch's forthcoming departure and asking for clarification on the phrase 'British Protection of the Pearl Banks' which is mentioned in instructions he has received as he is concerned both over the Turks' recent interest in them and that the boats from Katif [Al-Qatif] and Ojair [Uqayr] have been flying the Turkish flag.The letter goes on to discuss the hot weather he expects Pelly will encounter at Muskat [Muscat] and his hopes that it will not bring any fever and his own recent illness.The letter concludes by reporting that all is quiet in Bahrein [Bahrain] and that a messenger from Saood [Sa‘ūd] has arrived for the Chief [Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī, Āl Khalīfah] but that he is as yet unaware of the message that has been brought and giving his own personal opinion of the Chief.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024376733.0x000029#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
