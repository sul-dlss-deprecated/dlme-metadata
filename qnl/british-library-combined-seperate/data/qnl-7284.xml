The papers discuss the inability of the Iraqi police to use newly obtained stocks of American tear gas without proper instruction from trained officers. The need for tear gas had been made apparent to law enforcement agencies in Iraq after protests and disturbances against the continuing British military and political presence in the country during January of 1948.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner to Pakistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Tear Gas</topic></subject><subject><topic>Political demonstrations</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy in Iraq, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Police</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00034b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
