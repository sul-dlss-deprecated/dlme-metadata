Treaty of Alliance between the Honourable East India Company and His Highness Maharajah Mirza Rao Shree Dessuljee, his heirs and successors, concluded by Captain James Macmurdo, on the part of the Honourable Company, and by Jharejas Prutherajjee Vijerajjee, Meramunjee, Pragjee, Pragjee Mokajee, Allyajee, Nonghunjee, Bhanjee, and Jeymuljee, by virtue of full'powers from their respective Governments. Whereas a Treaty of Alliance, consisting of thirteen Articles, was concluded on the 16th January 1816, with two supplementary Articles, under date 18th'June 1816, between the Honourable East India Company and the Maharaj Rao Bhar- muljee and his successors. In consequence, however, of the hostile conduct of the said Rao towards the Honourable Company, and his tyranny and oppression to his Bhayad, it has become necessary for the stability of the alliance between the contracting parties to make certain alterations in the above-mentioned treaty. Article 1. It is hereby declared that all Articles of the aforesaid treaty which are not modified or superseded by any of the Articles in the present treaty shall be considered good and valid. Article 2. Agreeably to the desire of the Jhareja Bhayad, the Honourable Company agrees in declaring Bharmuljee to have forfeited all claims to the guddee of Kutch, and he is accordingly solemnly deposed. The said Bharmuljee shall reside in Bhooj as a State prisoner, under a guard of British troops, subject, however, to be removed to a place of further security in the event of his being implicated in any intrigue, the Kutch Government agreeing to pay annually the sum of 36,000 corries through the Honourable Company for the subsistence of the said Bhar muljee. Article 3. The infant son of the late Rao Bharmuljee having been unanimously elected by the Jhareja Chiefs to succeed to the vacant throne, he and his legitimate off spring are accordingly acknowledged by the Honourable Company as the lawful sovereigns of Kutch, under the name and title of Maharajah Mirza Rao Dessuljee. Article 4. In consequence of the minority of the present Rao Dessul, the Jhareja Bhayad, with the Honourable Company's advice, determine that a Regency shall be formed with full powers to transact the affairs of the government. The following are chosen as the members: Jhareja Vijerajjee, of Somri Roha, Jhareja Prutherajjee, of Naugercha, Rajgoor Odhowjee Hirbhoy, Mehta Luckmidas Wullubjee, Khuttri Ruttonsi Jettani, and the British Resident for the time being. These six persons are entrusted with the executive management of the Government of Kutch ; and in order that they may perform the service of the State with effect, the Honourable Company agree to afford the regency their guarantee, until the Rao completes his twentieth year, when the minority ceases.4 Article 5. The Honourable Company engages to guarantee the power of His Highness the Rao Dessul, his heirs and successors, and the integrity of his dominions, from foreign or domestic enemies, Article 6. The Honourable Company, at the desire of Rao Shree Dessul and the Jhareja Bhayad for the security of the Government of Kutch, agrees to leave a British force in its service. For the payment of this force, Rao Shree Dessuljee and the Jhareja Bhayad agree that funds shall be appropriated from the revenues of Kutch. The Honourable Company retains to itself the option of reducing or entirely with- drawing its troops (and relieving Kutch from the expense) whenever, in the opinion of Government, the efficiency and strength of the Rao's authority may admit of its being done with safety. Article 7. The money stipulated for in the -preceding Article is to be paid in instalments, each of four months, and it is further engaged that the Regency appointed in the 4th Article shall enter into a separate responsibility for the regular payments of the above kists. Article 8. The Kutch Government engages not to allow any Arabs, Seedees, or other foreign mercenaries to remain in its territories, nor generally to entertain any soldiers, not natives of Kutch, without the consent of the Honourable Company's Government. Article 9. The Kutch Government agrees that no foreign vessels, American, European, or Asiatic, shall be allowed to import into the territories of Kutch arms or military stores.' The Honourable Company engages to supply the wants of the Kutch Government in these articles at a fair valuation. Article 10. The Honourable Company engages to exercise no authority over the domestic concerns of the Rao or those of any of the Jhareja Chieftains of the country j that the Rao, his heirs and successors, shall be absolute masters of their territory; and that the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the British Government shall not be introduced therein. Article 11. It is clearly understood that the views of the British Government are limited to the reform and organization of the military establishment of the Kutch Govern ment, to the correction of any abuses which may operate oppressively on the inhabitants, and to the limitation of the general expenses of the State within its resources. Article 12. The Rao, his heirs and successors, engage not to enter into negotiations with any Chief or State without the sanction of the British Government, but their customary amicable correspondence with friends and relations shall continue. Article 13. The Rao, his heirs and successors, engage not to commit aggressions on any Chief or State, and if any disputes with such Chief or State accidentally arise, they are to be submitted for adjustment to the arbitration of the Honourable Company. Article 14. The Rao, his heirs and successors, engage to afford what military force they may possess to the aid of the Honourable Company's Government upon its requi sition. This Article, however, is not to be understood as imposing any duties on the Jhareja Bhayad contrary to their established customs.5 Article 15. The Kutch ports shall be open to all British vessels, in like manner as British ports shall be free to all vessels of Kutch, in order that the most friendly inter course may be carried on between the Governments. Article 16. The British Government, with the approbation of that of Kutch, engages to guarantee by separate deeds the Jhareja Chiefs of the Bhayad, and generally all Rajpoot Chiefs in Kutch and Wagur, in full enjoyment of their possessions, and further to extend the same protection to Mehta Luckmidas Wullubjee, who, for the welfare of the Kutch Durbar, has acted in concert with the Jharejas, and with great zeal and sincerity. Article 17. His Highness the Rao, his heirs and successors, at the particular instance of the Honourable Company, engage to abolish in their own family the practice of infanticide; they also engage to join heartily with the Honourable Company in abolishing the custom generally through the Bhayads of Kutch. Article 18. Previously to the execution of the deed of guarantee in favour of the Jhareja Bhayad, according to the tenor of the 16th Article, a written engagement shall be entered into by them to abstain from the practice of infanticide, and specifying that in case any of them do practise it, the guilty person shall submit to a punish ment of any kind that may be determined by the Honourable Company's Govern ment and the Kutch Durbar, Article 19. The British Resident or his Assistant shall reside in Bhooj, and be treated with appropriate respect by the Government of Kutch. Article 20. All supplies bond fide for the use of the Honourable Company's troops shall pass through the Rao's territories free of Rahdarree duties. Article 21. It being contrary to the religious principles of the Jharejas and people of Kutch, that cows, bullocks, and peacocks should be killed, the Honourable Company agree not to permit these animals to be killed in the territory of Kutch, or to permit in any way the religion of the natives to be obstructed. These twenty-one Articles are binding to the Rao, his heirs and successors, for ever, and to the Honourable Company. Done at Bhooj, on the thirteenth day of October A.D. 1819.

B6 Extract from Bombay Selection, No. XV., page 67, In 1836, His Highness the Rao issued the following proclamation, prohibiting the importation of slaves, and since then slavery may be said to have been discoun tenanced and discontinued in Kutch ; at the same time there is a class of household servants in the houses of the Chiefs and others in a position of modified slavery— slaves they are not, for, if so disposed, they can seek their livelihood elsewhere, still so long as they remain in their present employment, they are looked on as slaves though treated with the consideration due to junior members of the family. ' Proclamation. ' Be it known to the principal merchants of Mandvee, and every other merchant as well as trader in Kutch, whether belonging to it or only trading thereto, to all navigators of vessels,, to the inhabitants of Kutch generally, that if any slaves negroes or Abyssinians, shall be brought for sale to any seaport in Kutch after the middle of July next, the vessel conveying them shall be confiscated, and its cargo shall become the property of this Government (Durbar). No petition for its restoration shall be listened to; and, further, the offenders shall be brought to condign punishment, whether they belong to Kutch or another country. There will be no departure from this resolution. A vessel which brings slaves shall be seized, and summary punishment inflicted on those who navigate her. ' The British Government have made arrangements to suppress the trade in slaves throughout the adjacent countries, and it has instructed the officers com manding its ships to seize and retain all vessels bringing slaves. I therefore strictly prohibit, after the date before-mentioned, any more slaves being brought to this country; let all my subjects discontinue this custom, and take heed of this proclamation, and look to their interests and welfare by attending to it.' Extract Secret Letter from Bombay to the Secretary of State for India, dated 23d May (No. 21) 1860. 1. As connected with the subject of the slave trade at Zanzibar and on the north-east coast of Africa, we have the honour to forward copies of two reports from Lieutenant-Colonel C. P. Rigby, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent at Zanzibar, relative to his proceedings in connexion with the liberation of a large number of male and female slaves illegally held by British subjects at that place. 2. It affords this Government great gratification to bring Lieutenant-Colonel Rigby's meritorious labours to the favourable notice of Her Majesty's Government, characterized as they are by great judgment and resolution. 3. We have intimated to that officer an approval of his proceedings. * * * *. * * No. 10 of 1860. Political Department. Lieutenant-Colonel C. P. Rigby , Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, Zanzibar, to H. L. Anderson , Esq., Secretary to Government, Bombay. Sir, Zanzibar, 11th February 1860. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Right Hon. the Governor in Council,, the accompanying copy of depositions made before me by several male and female slaves who were in possession of a Banian, by name Kanoo Munjee, who has resided for many years at Zanzibar, and has extensive dealings with Arabs and others, at various places on the coast of Africa.ton 2. Having heard that Kanoo Munjee had been much engaged in slave dealing, and that he had been imprisoned by the late Lieutenant-Colonel Hamerton for slave transactions, I have frequently warned him of the heavy penalties he would incur if he ever again engaged in the purchase or sale of slaves. 3. A few days ago I visited a plantation belonging to Kanoo Munjee, situated about six miles from the town of Zanzibar, and having now acquired the African language spoken by the slaves here (the Kisnaheli), I entered into conversation with several Africans I met, and discovered that they were slaves of Kanoo Munjee, two of them having been purchased by him only two months ago from an Arab, who had just brought them to Zanzibar, and seven slaves, viz., three females, three males, and one young boy, having been brought to Zanzibar from the coast of Africa by Kanoo Munjee about eight months ago ; and others had been purchased in their own country in the interior of Africa by an agent for the purpose by Kanoo Munjee. 4. On my return home, I caused Kanoo Munjee to be arrested, and the slaves found in his possession brought to the British Consulate. I discovered that he had 69 slaves, of whom 38 were females and 31 males, many of both sexes are young children, recently brought from their own country. 5. I have procured every slave the legal certificate of emancipation, from the Cazee, sealed and countersigned by myself; I have also made Kanoo Munjee pay a sum of ten dollars to each slave for his present support, and he has also assigned, for a period of ten years, in proper legal form, two small plantations, each of about 600 dollars value, for the support of the young children who are not old enough to gain their own living. 6. Thus, in addition to the loss of the price of the 69 slaves, Kanoo Munjee has had to pay a considerable sum for their support, and as fees to the Cazee for their certificates of freedom, and I have, besides, confined him in the fort, and informed him that be will be sent out of the Zanzibar dominions by the first buggalow leaving for India. 7. ^s I find that, in spite of all warnings and threats. Banians and other natives of India residing here persist in buying and selling slaves, I have issued a notice, copy of which is annexed, warning all British subjects that if any slaves are found in their possession after the expiration of one month, they will be proceeded against as the law directs; I have also sent a copy of this notice to the Banians at Keelwa, which is the chief slave mart on the east coast of Africa. 8. There is abundant free labour procurable at Zanzibar j the European and American merchants generally have several hundred labourers in their employ, cleaning gum copal, cowries, curing hides, &amp;c., and hundreds of Arabs from the coast of Hadramant come here, who work as porters, loading and unloading ships, &amp;c. 9. I find that in the year 1843 His Highness the late Imaum, at the request of the Right Hon. the Governor General of India,, issued a proclamation, warning all his subjects against selling slaves to any native of India, and also forbidding them to buy slaves from any native of India, and at my request His Highness the Sultan Syed Majid has issued a similar proclamation, and also given strict orders to all the slave brokers never to sell a slave to any native of India, nor receive a slave for sale from them. His Highness has also included in this prohibition all persons of whatever country except his own subjects^ 10. I believe that when the purchase of slaves is confined to the subjects of the Zanzibar dominions the demand for them will be much diminished, and that the slave dealers will find it more profitable to bring articles of commerce from the interior. Nearly all the slaves imported into Zanzibar belong to the great African tribes of M'Nyassa, Miyaw, and Magindo, whose country is situated to the south west, near the great Lake Nyassa; they are all brought to the port of Keelwa, for shipment. No slaves are brought from the coast north of Zanzibar, as the tribes which inhabit the interior, being chiefly Massai, Gallas, and Somalis, are too warlike and fierce to be hunted. 11. During the last few years the cultivation of sesamun and rice on the opposite coast has much increased, and these articles are now exported from Mombass and Samoo to the amount of about two lacs of rupees annually. Ther8 sesamun is all exported to Marseilles. The increase of cultivation is entirely owing to the stoppage of the export of slaves to Arabia and the north. 12. After the expiration of one month I will report for the information of Go vernment the number of slaves who have been emancipated by British subjects residing in the Zanzibar dominions, pursuant to the notice I have issued to them. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) C. P. Rigby , Lieutenant-Colonel, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, British Consulate, Zanzibar, Zanzibar. 11th February 1860. Notice. To all British subjects residing in the Zanzibar Dominions. Whereas by a proclamation issued seventeen years ago, His Highness the late Sultan Syed Said bin Sultan expressly forbid all his subjects to sell any slaves to any natives of India, and also to buy any slaves from any natives of India residing in any part of his dominions. And whereas the purchase or sale of slaves by British subjects in any part of the world has been forbidden by the British Government under the severest penalties. Nevertheless, Banians and other natives of India residing in the Zanzibar do minions have continued to buy and sell slaves up to the present time. I do hereby give notice, that if any slaves are found in the possession of any native of India, after the expiration of one month from the present date, he will be dealt with as the law directs. All natives of India who now possess slaves are hereby directed to take them before the Cazee and procure the legal certificate of emancipation. Any native of India who shall bring a slave to Zanzibar from the coast of Africa, or from any other country, or who shall in any way assist in the traffic in slaves, by advancing money to slave dealers, or by conveying slaves in their boats or buggalows, or by receiving slaves in pawn or pledge, will be fined one hundred dollars for each offence, and sent as a prisoner to Bombay.

Resolution of the Government of Bombay, dated 30th April 1860. Resolved, That the Agent's proceedings be fully approved. That copies of this letter, without the depositions, be forwarded to the Govern ment of India * and to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India. (Signed) H. W. Reeves, W. E. Frere. No. 13 of 1860. Political Department. Lieutenant-Colonel C. P. Rigby , Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, Zanzibar, to H. L. Anderson , Esq., Secretary to Government, Bombay. ^ , Zanzibar, 21st March 1860. n.u 1^ reference to my letter to your addresss, No. 10 of 1860, dated the 11th ultimo, Political Depa rtment, informing you that I had issued a notice to all * Forwarded to that authority.,oe&gt; the British subjects residing in the Zanzibar dominions, directing them to take all slaves in their possession before the Cazee, and procure them the legal certificate of emancipation within one month from the date of the notice, I have the honour to report, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, that pursuant to the above notice three thousand two hundred and eighty-seven (3,287) slaves of both sexes have been emancipated, of these about 1,200 were employed as domestic slaves in the town of Zanzibar, and the remainder were kept as field labourers on plantations in the interior of the island. The above number does not include 133 slaves previously liberated from slavery by me. 2. 1 directed the owners of all these slaves to first take them before the Cazee, and procure for each the legal Certificate of emancipation, they then brought them before me, I then numbered each certificate and wrote the name of each in English, and then signed and sealed them, and entered them in a register with the number, date of emancipation, name, age, and tribe of each slave, together with the name of the person from whom redeemed, and I then explained to each slave personally, that he was in future a free subject of the Sultan, that his or her children could never be made slaves, and that they were at liberty to go where soever they pleased. 3. As the slaves who had been employed in plantations might have found great difficulty in procuring a living if upwards of two thousand were suddenly cast out to shift for themselves, I have in nearly every case succeeded in making an arrangement between the emancipated slaves and their former masters, whereby the latter agree to give up to the former part of each plantation for their own use, in return for which the negroes agree to work four days in each week for the owner of the estate, having the other three days to cultivate their own portion, and they all clearly understand that they are free to quit the estate when they please, that they cannot be sold or transferred, and that the owner has no longer the power of chaining them up, or of punishing them in any way. At the same time I have given notice to all the owners of estates, that in case they transfer their land to Arabs, or any other than British subjects they will have to make provision for these labourers and their families, as they had illegally held them in slavery. 4 In every case where the slaves complained of having been treated with cruelty, or where they appeared to me to have been starved or neglected, I made the former master pav them a sum of from ten to twenty dollars each to enable them to procure proper food and clothing. The masters have absolute power over their slaves, and all slave owners keep chains and iron rings for the neck, leg irons, &amp;c., and they chain up and imprison their slaves at will I think that thl natives of India generally treated their slaves W1 u th ^ndness, but some cases of gross cruelty to them have been discovered. In the house of a Mahommedan of the Khojeh tribe, a poor girl, about twelve years of age, was found chained by the neck with thick iron rings, fastened with a heavy lock and attached to a chain of great weight, the iron cutting into the flesh of the neck I therefore caused this man to be publicly flogged, and have imprisoned him in the fort until the dhows sail for India, when he will be sent out of the Zanzibar dominion. 5. The emancipation of sq many slaves caused considerable excitement here, and the owners endeavoured to evade compliance with the order m every way. For some days they threatened to stop all trade if their slaves were emancipated, some denied they were British subjects, others disguised themselves as Arabs, the slaves were frightened by being told that, after their names were written down at the Consulate, they would be seized and sent away in ships ; but, atter a tew da} s, finding that they were treated kindly, and that I insisted on their masters pro curing them all decent clothing before they brought them to be registered, they gained confidence, and have come of their own accord from the most distant parts of the island, and from the coast of Africa, to ask for their certificates of freedom. 6 All the slaves in the island of Zanzibar, belonging to natives of India, whether British subjects or natives of protected States, have now been emancipated, excepting such as are too ill to attend or whose masters are absent. Theie aie still however, between two and three thousand slaves at places on the opposite mainland, held by natives of India resident there, and at my request His Highness the Sultan has sent orders to all his Authorities, directing that these slaves be at 11532. C10 cnce emancipated by the Cazees, and that no slaves are in future to be sold to any natives of India, and I have directed all the certificates of emancipation to be sent to me for registry. 7. Having thus been engaged with these slaves from morning till night during the last six weeks, I have gained more knowledge of the manner in which the slave trade is carried on than would have been possible in any other way. I soon observed that most of the older slaves belonged to tribes which inhabit the Marima or coast districts opposite Zanzibar, whilst most of those which have been brought here during the last few years belong to the great tribes of Mujan and M'Nyassa, whose country is situated to the south, far inland, near the great Lake Nyassa, It appears that the tribes near the coast have been seized and sold to such an extent that the supply is exhausted; the M'do tribe, which some years ago fur nished most of the slaves brought to Zanzibar, is said to be quite extinct. The slave trade is every year being carried further into the interior, amongst tribes where it had previously been unknown. The great Mujan tribe, which occupied a vast extent of rich country, producing cotton abundantly, is now nearly exhausted, and districts which a few years ago were populous and productive, are now entirely destitute of inhabitants. The slave traffic is now carried on even beyond the Lake of Nyassa, and is depopulating the rich valleys inhabited by the Manganga tribe, where cotton is so abundant that it might soon become a great article of export, were the Portuguese to put a stop to the slave trade which is carried on to so great an extent at their ports on the east coast. 8. Natives of India who have resided many years at Keelwa, the chief slave mart in the Zanzibar territories on the coast, state that it is only within the last ten or twelve years that Arab slave dealers go into the interior with large numbers of armed followers on purpose to procure slaves, and that whole districts are systematically hunted to procure them, the cupidity of the native Chiefs being excited by the muskets, gunpowder, and cotton cloth they receive from the Arabs in payment for them. They also state that districts near Keelwa, extending to ten or twelve days' journey, which a few years ago were thickly populated are now entirely uninhabited, and an Arab who has recently returned here from Lake Nyassa informs me that he travelled for 17 days through a country covered with ruined towns and villages, which a few years ago were inhabited by the M'Nyassa and Mujan tribes, and where now no living soul is seen. 9. In registering these 3,000 emancipated slaves, I have remarked the extra ordinary paucity of childen amongst them, certainly less than five per cent, of the adult females bear children. I have questioned the slaves particularly as to whether they can assign any cause for a state so opposed to nature, they all give the same answer, that being slaves, and liable to be deprived of their children at the will of their masters, they do not care to be at the trouble of rearing children, and there fore the family tie is almost unknown amongst them. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) C. P. Rigby , Lieutenant-Colonel, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, British Consulate, Zanzibar, Zanzibar. 21st March 1860.

Sir, Zanzibar, 28th March 1860. 1 have the honour to report, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, that, during the north-east monsoon just past, a very unusual number of boats and buttelas, belonging to the piratical tribes of the coast of Oman and the Persian Gulf, have visited Zanzibar and the ports on the east coast of Africa. 2. At the port of Mombass, Arabs of these pirate tribes commenced stealing the slaves and children of the inhabitants to such an extent that the latter rose and attacked them, and several lives were lost. 3. At Chak Chak, the port of the island of Pemba, about 15 large boats filled with Sooree and Joasmee pirates remained for several days plundering the country, and were only deterred from plundering the town of Chak Chak by the timely arrival of one of His Highness's ships of war. 4. On the 23d ultimo, the Nakhoda of a buggalow reported to me, that, whilst on his passage from Bombay under English colours, soon after leaving Mombass, his buggalow was chased by six pirate boats belonging to the Joasmee Arabs, and that in endeavouring to evade them, his buggalow was run on the Waseen rocks and lost, together with most of the crew and passengers. 5. I immediately informed His Highness of this circumstance, and he at once despatched his ship 44 City of Poona ' to Waseen, with 200 soldiers ; it was the fortunate arrival of this vessel at Chak Chak, which prevented that place being plundered. 6. These pirate boats leave their own coast just at the commencement of the north-east monsoon, and arrive at Zanzibar during the months of December, January, and February; they leave the coast of Africa to return north with the commencement of the south-west monsoon about the middle of March j each boat is crowded with armed men, they bring nothing for sale, and they take no cargo back, in fact, the boats are so filled with men that they could not possibly carry any cargo. Their sole object in coming to this coast is to procure slaves, either by kidnapping or by clandestine sale. 7. During the time these northern Arabs are here, Zanzibar resembles a city with a hostile army encamped in its neighbourhood, every person who is able to do so sends his children and young slaves into the interior of the island for security, people are afraid to stir out of their house after dark, reports are daily made of children and slaves kidnapped, and in the suburbs of the town they even enter the houses and take the children away by force. 8. Last month an African boy, who had been emancipated from slavery by me, was stolen from the house of a German merchant adjoining the British Consulate, and the little daughter of the havildar of peons at the Consulate was also stolen. Sooree Arabs have been found carrying kidnapped children through the public streets in large baskets during the day, their mouths being gagged to prevent their crying out. So little dependence can be placed on any of the Sultan's officials to stop this atrocious system, that I have been informed that a confidential Turkish Jemadar, who was placed in charge of a body of soldiers to patrol the sea-shore at night, actually himself sold 62 children to the northern Arabs, whilst thus employed. 9. I have repeatedly urged His Highness to take measures to put a stop to the outrages of these northern Arabs, by directing his soldiers to patrol the streets and sea-shore at night, and by ordering the Commanders of his ships of war to search boats and dhows in the harbour; I have myself frequently discovered slaves on board northern boats, and on reporting it to His Highness he has at once ordered them to be re-landed. On one occasion it was discovered that 40 slaves were in a dhow about to sail, and it was ascertained that they had been secretly 1 t is12 sold by the slave brokers, in consequence of wbich His Highness arrested the brokers and caused them to be publicly flogged. in A frw davs aeo, I discovered aMacullabuggalow about to sail north, having under his own flag *nd owne^l by his own subjects, to part of his 0^^ all his ports on the coast to give on board an/boats whatsoever, except those belonging to his own subjects. 11 I believe that, in spite of all that His Highness can do, and of orders ^he^oat^^^l^^^^atT^^es^fro^^^e^shOTes^A^rabia SnuTto' come on rar mSreffect in cheXng them. Their boats being of light draught, and most of teTKttoSdT unsafe'for'ships to cruiLTantif ctS'bj a s^'oTw.-, they S no more of throwing the' slaves overboard than if they were brute animals. 12 I am of opinion, that this cruel system might be easily stopped were a steam eunboat of light draught stationed at Zanzibar during the months of January, loWnarv nnf March The knowledge that a vessel was here purposely to watch them ^o'ul ^alol^e deter many from Imbarking slaves, and probably after one or two seasons the pirate boats would cease to visit the east coast of Africa, and their owners would gradually find some more profitable and safe occupation. At present I believe, that these tribes look to the kidnapping of slaves from these coasts as their chief means of support throughout the year, and they come here because piracy in the Persian Gulf is no longer profitable or sate. 13 One drawback to steam vessels visiting Zanzibar was the want of coal, but His Highness the Sultan has ordered a supply from England, and one of the German mercantile firms here has also ordered out a supply, on purpose for the use of ships of war visiting this port.

I have the honour to report, for the information of His Excellency the Honourable the Governor in Council, that, in consequence of a great number of plantations on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba being mortgaged, together with the slaves attached to such plantations, by the Arab proprietors to British sub jects, I have issued a notice addressed to all British subjects residing in the Zanzibar dominions, directing that, whenever a mortgaged plantation is taken possession of by the mortgagee, he must immediately bring all the slaves on such plantation to the British Consulate, to be emancipated and registered. 2. In a notice which I issued to the British subjects at Zanzibar, dated 10th February 1860, warning them of the penalties of trafficking in slaves, they are likewise forbidden to receive slaves in pawn or pledge, and since that date, there fore, they have discontinued including the slaves in mortgages of plantations. 3. Probably three-fourths of the immoveable property on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba are either already in the possession of British subjects or mortgaged to them. The Arabs are all wasting their substance in drunkenness and debauchery, the degraded victims of the system of slavery, by which they regard any kind of honest industry as beneath an Arab, and only befitting negro slaves.

Extract Letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Felly , Acting Consul and Agent at Zanzibar, to the Bombay Government, dated 1st February (No. 113) 1862. The value of landed property came to be estimated by the amount of slave, labour on the estate; the value of house property depended of course upon the demand, and this upon the thriving condition or otherwise of commerce. When we emancipated the slaves of our British Indian subjects, nearly all the estates held by them were held in mortgage for value advanced to Arab proprietors at a time when these estates were valuable on account of their slaves. But when these slaves were emancipated, the value of the estates fell proportionately; heavy loss was sustained by our subjects; credit was shaken ; no person but apprehended that the past emancipation was but the prelude of a general abolition throughout the State, and hence no man would advance on security of any landed estate. The circulation of money was checked in the source; commerce in general became affected; the value of all property, house or landed, fell, and seemed likely, under 11532. D14 , , i.,. .

L The following information is given by a Bhatia trader, who was at different places on the East Coast of Africa from 1859 to 1866. 2. There are natives of India at the following places 1. Lamu. 2. Mombaz. 3. Zanzibar. 4. Kiloa. 5. Viboo. 6. Mozambique. 7. Quilimani. 8. Sofala. 9. Juhambani. 10. Komoro. 11. Mazota. 12. Western Coast of Madagascar. 13. Mauritius. 14.

Parsees; believed to be from Dm and Damaon. Woras ; from Kutch, Kattywar, and Bombay. Miscellaneous castes, such as Brahmins, barbers, tailors, silversmiths, masons, and other craftsmen. 4.

Perhaps I ought not to say anything about Mauritius at all, because not only it has no connexion with the slave trade, but my informant knows very little about that island. 6. My informant lived at Zanzibar, Viboo, and Mozambique. He also visited the following places on the coast:—Mombaz, Mungonee, Meggijima (two small islands near Zanzibar), Kiloa, Mungao, Pemba, Chunga, and Luri. He has a brother and other relations at Vibu. He gives the above figures as a rough estimate, and by no means as accurate. 7. With the exception of Brahmins and others shown above as miscellaneous castes, the Indians are traders and their employes. They carry on trade with Bombay, Kutch, Kurrachee, and the Portuguese possessions on the western coast of India. 8. They export to India ivory, chundroas (gum copal), specie, tortoiseshell, amber, cloves, rhinoceros skins, timber, cocoa-nuts, horns, shells, and one or two kinds of corn (mug, Indian corn, jowar, &amp;c.). 9. They import from India piece goods, metals, wheat, spices, rice, sugar, molasses, beads, and dates. 10. There is no slave trade with India. 11 In the port of Zanzibar itself, Indian traders are not concerned in the slave trade' or do not own slaves. They employ negroes in domestic and other works, but pay for their services. There may be a few negroes once owned as slaves by Bhatias and Khojas, but they are no longer slaves now. The negroes know this well, although, owing to good treatment, they do not leave their masters. 12. The same is to be said of Lamu and Mombaz. 13. In Kiloa, it is believed, that the slave trade is secretly carried on. Whether any Indian traders are concerned in it my informant is unable to say. U He suspects that in other, and more out of the way places, in the province of Zanzibar such as Toonghee, Musimba, Funghari, Looraba, Than S® e ' ^ a '^' r! i iu fflc. ^nianp-a it is carried on by the natives. He does not think that ^^In'dtan^ra^ers are' concenied tn it, although they visit all these places for purposes of trade. l ^ Rut traffic in human beings exists more or less on the coast to the south o Zaiizibar^ and hi^ the adjoining iifands. It receives little or no check from the local authorities. ir The number of slaves exported from these parts is, however, small com- 16 ; PtL rXr bought and sold to supply local demand.

None of the Hindoos on the African coast (except, I believe, barbers) have their wives with them. Some do not return to their homes for long periods. A few of these buy or engage female negroes who, with their children, if any, are invariably left behind when their masters return to India. 20. With regard to the subjects of Kutch, the Durbar has no control over those who live on the African coast. There is no slave trade with, or slavery in, Kutch itself. There is a direct trade between that country and the eastern coast of Africa carried on by boats belonging to Manday. 21. Before 1836 slavery existed in Kutch. The slaves were imported directly from the African and the Arabian coasts. In that year His Highness the late Rao issued a proclamation* {vide p. 310 of Government Selections on Kutch) prohibiting the trade under heavy penalties. I do not know whether there were any cases in which it was necessary to inflict these penalties, but it is a fact that the slave trade has not existed for many years, and does not now exist in Kutch. 22. Last year another proclamation was issued by His Highness to the same effect. It was published in the Bombay Government Gazette. Being at the time absent from Kutch, I do not know exactly the object of the said proclama tion. I believe that the words ' Kutch subjects,' made use of in a paragraph which appeared in a Bombay paper, led to the issue of the proclamation. Other wise there was no necessity whatever for it.

Churchill , Esq., C .B., Political Agent and Her Majesty's Consul, Zanzibar, to C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Sj r&gt; 22d December 1867. In a Despatch addressed by the Right Hon. Lord Stanley to Dr. Seward, of which I beg leave to transmit to you a copy, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, I am requested to inform Her Majesty's Government ' whether any of Her Majesty's Indian subjects in Zanzibar are in the, ' habit of holding slaves,' and am told that ' it would be satisfactory to know that « the steps taken by Colonel Rigby, in releasing a large number of slaves held in ' bondage by British Indian subjects, have proved effective, to prevent a con- « tinuance of the abuse by Her Majesty's Indian subjects of British laws for the ' suppression of the slave trade.' 2. Already, on my arrival at Zanzibar, I had learnt, with no little concern, the fact that, although Colonel Rigby had succeeded in emancipating all the slaves in the possession of the natives of India established in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, upwards of one thousand two hundred slaves were still held in bondage by natives of that country, and that they enjoyed this privilege because they were under the protection of His Highness Seyd Majid. It struck me as being a circumstance worthy of notice that the Sultan should call himself the best friend of the British Government, and yet assist natives of India, by the protection he extended to them, in frustrating the efforts of the British Govern ment to put a stop to the slave trade, and I did not fail to draw His Highness's attention to this anomaly. I told His Highness that it was a matter of much importance that the existence of this state of things should cease, and that I should soon do myself the honour to speak to him seriously on the subject; but, from His Highness's evasive reply, I felt that he was not over anxious to discuss the question with me, and as I was desirous, on my part, to read up the instructions, and see how far I should be borne out by Government in pro moting the liberation of the said slaves, I was not sorry to put off, for a while, the discussion. 3. I learnt, from an attentive perusal of the instructions,— 1st. That, up to Colonel Rigby's departure from Zanzibar, no native of India had dared to possess a slave, after the sweeping emancipation pro secuted by that energetic Officer. 2d. That Colonel Rigby had received the approval of Government in all his proceedings with regard to the slave trade and the emancipation of the slaves above alluded to. 3d. That it was after Colonel Rigby's departure that natives of India were allowed to plaCe themselves under the Sultan's protection. From other sources I ascertained that the natives of India under the Sultan's protection, in whose country domestic slavery had ceased to exist for a con- 11532. E18 siderable time had, within the last five or six years, purchased many slaves, and werekiducin^'their countrymen under British protection to reap the advantages of slave labour through their instrumentality, and several cases in which Banyans under British protection were accused, in Her Majesty s Consular Court, of holding 1 slaves had to be dismissed, from the simple assertion that the slaves did not befong to the accused individual, but to his brother or his uncle, who were under the Sultan's protection; and as this plea proved to be a sufficient one, for it was invariably well supported by evidence, it soon became obviously fruitless for the poor slaves to come to the Consulate, and complain that they were held in bondage by British subjects. 4. But my predecessor's resolution to protect no subjects of the protected Indian States who had not applied for such protection, was ^'y o b . 0 X r ''wn no instructions of the Honourable the Bombay Government; and had there been no later instructions than those of the ^th'july 1863 No. 2341 - I sho^d have hesitated to take any steps in the matter. In a letter, Q h , ow F e ^ Secretary to the Government of India, No. 104^ of the 3d Februa ^ addressed to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, it is rul ed that the ' subjects of any Native State bound, as Kutch is, to have no relations with ' foreign Powers, are morally entitled to be admitted m foreign territory to all « the privileges which natives of British India enjoy m the same locality, and as « the Sultan of Muscat and the subjects of Kutch resident in his dominions seem, ' from the passages marginally quoted, neither of them to entertain any doubt on « this point, His Excellency in Council conceives that there can be no obstacle « to the Political Agent at Muscat exercising the same authority m respect to « Kutchees as in respect to British subjects. The Political Agent should be ' authorized to act in accordance with this opinion.' 5. It is obvions that the above quoted resolution of His Excellency the Governor General in Council is meant for Zanzibar as well as for Muscat, and His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, like the ruler of Muscat, has never doubted the right of the British Government to exercise jurisdiction over the natives of Kutch or any other protected State in India, but since the abandonment by my predecessors of the right of protecting such of these natives of India who did not seek our protection, His Highness assumes that we have no further right to jurisdiction over them. 6 While weighing these considerations, I received the Right Honourable the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs' Despatch enclosed herewith, expressing a hope that the steps taken by Colonel Rigby had proved effective to prevent a continuance of the abuse by Her Majesty's Indian subjects of British laws for the suppression of the slave trade. 7 Now as ninety-nine out of a hundred of the slaves liberated by Colonel Rigby were the property of Kutchees, the Secretary of State evidently referred to the subjects of British protected States of ludia residing in the dominions of Sultan Mai id, including all those who have since sought the protection of His Highness Seyd Majid. And I hesitated no longer m addressing the Sultan two letters which I beg to enclose in translation, the first claiming at his hands fpr trial a native of Kutch under His Highness's protection, who had committed a misdemeanor, and the second attacking the whole question of jurisdiction. 8. His Highness may be said to have tacitly admitted my right to exercise consular jurisdiction over the natives of India under his protection by having sent me without any comment the accused person, and by having allowed me without protest to try him and sentence him to imprisonment in His Highness s own tort; but he may also be said to have done so out of courtesy, and this I believe to have been the case. My second letter appears to have alarmed him, and he immediately expressed a wish to call on me and explain matters. 9. In the interview that ensued, His Highness argued that, had not my pre decessors allowed it, no native of India would this day be holding slaves in his dominions, but that having been told that Kutchees and subjects of other pro tected States of India might be looked on as His Highness's Arab subjects, His * Note. Not separately reported from India, Bombay, or Zanzibar, and not entered in the Consultations.i \li J/' 19 Highness had allowed them to purchase slaves, and that it was not fair now to punish them for what they had done innocently, believing that they were doing no wrong. This argument I thought a fair one, for although I have never seen the document by which either Colonel Pelly, or Colonel Playfair authorized the natives of India under the Sultan's protection to possess slaves, they may, by the policy of non-intervention adopted by these Officers, have led them and the Sultan to infer that Her Majesty's Consul would not take cognizance of anything they did ; and bearing in view the general and more important question of the slave trade, and the policy of humouring His Highness in matters of comparatively minor importance, I made known to Seyd Majid my readiness to refer the matter to His Excellency the Governor in Council. 10. I have the honour to transmit to you, in translation, Seyd Majid's letter in reply to mine on this subject. 11. I have reason to believe that His Highness would be satisfied if the Kutchees who had become slave-owners through his instrumentality were in demnified on being deprived of their slaves. 12. Under any circumstances, it will be necessary for me, before the receipt of your reply, to ascertain the exact number of slaves held by these people, as I apprehend an increase or a decrease in the number of the said slaves, according to the chance they have of being indemnified or not. 13. Their craftiness is something beyond conception, nor would they hesitate to get free men to swear that they were their slaves, if they had a chance of getting paid for them.

Edwin Seward, Esq.20 Hfnry A. Churchill , Esq., C.B., Her Majesty's Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar, to His Highness Majid bin Saeed , Sultan of Zanzibar, dated 10th December 1867. After compliments. For some months past theft has been rife in Zanzibar, and, notwithstanding the exertions of your officers entrusted with the police of the town, houses and shops are being broken into, or opened with false keys, and property is stolen. Within the last few days it has been discovered that a native of Kutch, Jairam Waljee by name, was at the head of a gang of thieves, whom he furnished with information and with the necessary implements to penetrate into the premises containing valuable property. Certain depositions having been made at the Consular Court by British subjects, with reference to a quantity of stolen goods found in the possession of Jairam Waljee, it becomes my imperative duty to cause this individual to be apprehended and tried for his misdeeds, and, although he has forfeited the protection of Her Majesty's Government by not inscribing his name in the register of British pro tected subjects, and has placed himself under Your Highness's protection, I do not consider that he has, in so doing, deprived me of the power I have of exercising jurisdiction over all British subjects, and British protected subjects, in Your Highness's dominions. As the said person is under Your Highness's protection, however, I shall feel diffident in causing him to be arrested by my own men, and I have, therefore, the honour to request that Your Highness will issue such orders as will ensure his appearance before Her Majesty's Criminal Court as soon as possible. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H. A. Churchill. Henry Churchill , Esq., C.B., Her Majesty's Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar, to His Highness Seyd Majid , Sultan of Zanzibar, dated 16th December 1867. After compliments. I have, on several occasions, had the honour to draw Your Highness's attention to the fact that, notwithstanding the Proclamation of the late Seyd Saeed and Your Highness's own, issued soon after your father's death, that no slaves be sold to natives of India; and, notwithstanding the stringent measures taken by Colonel Rigby to emancipate the slaves held at Zanzibar by natives of India, there are still in the possession of the latter many slaves which it was incumbent on me to liberate. In my first conversation with Your Highness on this important subject, I am afraid that I failed to make clear to Your Highness the difference existing between protection and jurisdiction. It will be my task in this communication to explain that difference. In Colonel Hamerton and Colonel Rigby's time, as your Highness is well aware, all natives of India at Zanzibar were under British protection, and thence it is that no particular mention is made of the subjects of the Rao of Kutch. It is only of late years that natives of India have been allowed to place themselves under your Highness's protection, and this because they had been deprived of British protection in consequence of their not having inscribed their names in the registers of Her Majesty's Consulate. But these individuals enjoy Your Highness's protection in the same way that all foreigners in Your Highness's service enjoy it, and in an equal degree with your Highness's subjects who may be in the service of Europeans at Zanzibar, who enjoy the protection of the Sovereign of whom their meters are the subjects. If, for instance, one of your Highness's subjects, in the service of a European at Zanzibar, were to commit a crime punishable by your laws, would not your Highness claim the culprit of the protective Consul of that European, and would not that Consul, on being convinced of the culpability of the accused person, cause him to be given up to your Highness ? The mode of proceeding would be in strict accordance with the treaties, and it is but just that your Highness should21 punish your own subjects, and that Her Majesty's Government should punish theirs and those of Chiefs under their protection. The act of buying, selling, and possessing slaves is, according to the criminal laws of India, a crime punishable in a manner less severe than murder, but more so than theft, and it is a crime that it behoves me to punish whenever it is com mitted by a British subject in your Highness's dominions. The subjects of the Rao of Kutch, who have forfeited British protection in Zanzibar, are, in my opinion, as much under the jurisdiction of Her Majesty's Consul as all other British subjects who may not have inscribed their names in the register of the Consulate, and, if I have not hitherto acted up to this principle, it is out of defe rence to your Highness that I have not done so, but now that I have explained to you the difference between protection and jurisdiction, I deem it to be my duty definitely to put a stop to the holding of slaves by natives of India in your Highness's dominions. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H. A. Churchill. Translation. His Highness Syud Majid , Sultan of Zanzibar, to H. A. Churchill , Esq., C .B., Political Agent, Her Majesty's Consul, Zanzibar, 23d Shaban 1284 (21st December 1867). I have received your honoured letter, and have understood its meaning. Let it not be hidden from your honour that, in the days of our late father, Syud Saeed, Colonel Hamerton asked him, in the name of the British Govern ment, to issue an order requiring all natives of India in his dominions to free their slaves, and our father replied that he would do so, but asked for the natives of India two years' time, and this on account of friendship. This request was complied with, but before the expiration of the two years both my father and Colonel Hamerton had died, and Colonel Rigby arrived, and, acting up to what had been agreed between my late father and Colonel Hamerton, he liberated all the slaves belonging to the natives of India. On Colonel Rigby's departure from Zanzibar, Colonel Felly came and made known to me, in writing, his wish that all British subjects in our dominions present themselves before him and inscribe their names in a register, and they accordingly presented themselves before him. Then came Colonel Playfair, and sent us a register containing the names of all British subjects residing in our dominions, and wrote to explain to us that the names of all British protected subjects were in that register, and that, with the exception of British subjects born on British soil, none others, whose names were not in the register, should enjoy British protection. A few days subsequently our good father, Suleiman bin Ahmed, issued a notice which did not meet with Colonel Playfair's approval, and the latter wrote to us a a letter stating that all sfich as had not yet entered their names in the Consular register that he had sent us, should be considered as Arabs, and that those alone who had caused their names to be written in the book were under British protection. We have agreed to this decision, for Colonel Playfair had brought us a letter from the Honourable the Governor of Bombay requesting us to accept, without hesitation, all Colonel Playfair's suggestions in matters connected with the British Government, adding, that the British Government, reposing full con fidence in that Officer's discretion, capacity, and experience, had sent him to Zanzibar. We therefore abided by what had been done by Colonel Playfair, and con- sidered the status of all such as had not entered their names in the Consular register as assimilated to that of the Arabs in reference to jurisdiction, and at liberty to buy slaves, &amp;c. Colonel Playfair knows this very well and will not deny it. This continued during Dr. Seward's tenure of office, and until your arrival. Such, Sir, is the true state of the case, but now we perceive the advent of a different policy, viz., that slaves shall not be held by natives of any 11532. F22 j - f : nn w hether thev have registered their names or not, and that, although they are not under your protection, they continue nevertheless to be '' tm / v I c V oVthe 5 case is at variance with that entertained by your predecessors in Zanzibar! Those who have not entered their names in the Consular register have committed no crime in possessing slaves, for we gave them permission to do so Their status, having been assimilated by Colonel Playfair, in his letter to us, to that of the Arabs, having been abandoned to our junsdictioiu We urgently request Your Honour to represent this to the Government and to await their reply. There are, moreover, many natives of India in our service whom we consider as being under our protection, and as Arabs so long as they remain in our service. Many of these, although of Indian parentage are born m this country, some of them as far back as 50 years ago, and we look upon these nnfl their children as our subjects the Arabs. We expect a reply from Government on these matters, and may peace be with you ' (Signed) Seyd Majid bin Saeed bin Sultan. No. 2147. No. 73 of 1868. Political Department. C.

It is proposed now to say to them, though you have not our protection, either by right of birth or by force of registration, you are yet subject to our jurisdiction, and are amenable to us for doing that which is no crime either in the country in which you reside, or that from which you come. 4. It appears to the Right Honourable the Governor General in Council that the British Government have no right to interfere. 5. If it is expedient to interfere, the Governor in Council thinks that he can only do it by an understanding with the Rao, in virtue of which his subjects will be legally, as well as morally, entitled to our protection, and, in return, liable to our jurisdiction, and in that case, if the slaves now held by Kutchees are to be liberated. His Excellency in Council concludes, under the circumstances, they will be entitled to compensation, which the British taxpayer, and not the Indian, will have to pay, as it may be almost certainly taken for granted that the Rao will not.

No. 48. No. 42/159, dated 14th August 1868. Henry A. Churchill , Esq., C.B., Political Agent and Her Majesty's Consul, Zanzibar, to C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to Government, Bombay. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two communications, the one, JNo. 879, of the 31st of March, transmitting me the copy of your letter. No 73 to the Foreign Secretary at Calcutta, with reference to the subject matter of myDespatch, No. 399/84 of 1867, and the other, No. 1256, of the 9th May last, con- veying to me a copy of Sir R. Temple's letter, No. 418, regarding the interference of the British Government with the Kutchees established in Zanzibar, in the matter of offences against British law; and I am requested to reply to the fol lowing questions, viz., whether the Kutchees referred to merely own and hold slaves, or whether they deal in, and make contracts regarding slaves, involving transactions tantamount to slave-dealing, and if their case resembles in any way that of Messrs. H. A. Fraser and Co., at Zanzibar, which was held to involve such an approach to slave-dealing as to come under the prohibition of English law. In reply to these questions, I have the honour to state, that the Kutchees referred to in my letter. No. 399/841, namely, those who have elected Syud Majid's pro tection to that of Her Majesty's Political Agent, do not merely own and hold slaves by inheritance or otherwise, but they trade in slaves, purchasing and selling them, bartering, transferring, and removing them from place to place. In point of fact, they are regular slave-dealers. The Sultan's pretensions are that Her Majesty's Consulate having declined to protect the individuals (British subjects as well as Kutchees), whose names were not registered in the books of the Consulate, they are at liberty to act in his dominion as they may please, so long as they do not do anything against the laws of his country, and so far his claims cannot be contested ; but he goes a step further, and says, 'having declined to protect these ' subjects of yours and these natives of India whose country is under your pro- ' tection, you have thereby lost all jurisdiction over them ; they may do as the « Arabs do. They may buy slaves at Kilwa, and convey them to Zanzibar or « elsewhere in my dominions, and sell them by auction in the public market. ' Thev may employ their slaves on their estates; they may transfer them to ' whomsoever they please; they may hire them out at so much a day. When ' the Northern Arabs come down from Muscat and the Persian Gulf, and the «• value of slaves rises in the market, they may sell their slaves (provided they do « not sell them to the Northern Arabs, who succeed in getting them nevertheless), « and with the profit they may have made they may invest in more slaves.' Nay, they may even send kidnapping expeditions to the Nyassa, and, at a loss of life that I shudder to think of, they may bring down, or cause to be brought, to the coast a fresh supply of these wretched creatures. The Sultan's laws do not prohibit these acts, and Her Majesty's Indian subjects and the Kutchees who are not protected by the Consulate, having been assimilated, to all intents and pur poses, (says Syud Majid) to his own subjects, cannot be punished for acts that are not prohibited in his dominions. . . r The question at issue, therefore, appears to me to be, whether it is expedient tor the British Government, desirous as they are of suppressing the slave trade on this coast of Africa, having effectually suppressed it on the west coast, to relinquish their hold on the Kutchees who form the wealthiest class of the trading population of Zanzibar. The question as to whether that of the Kutchees resembles that of Messrs H A. Fraser &amp; Co. requires no special answer after what has been said. It may be asked, then, why, in the face of such a state of things, the whole of the subiects of the Rao of Kutch, established in the Sultan's territory, and they amount to about 3,000, have not long since gone over to the Sultan of Zanzibar. The suddenness of the measures adopted by Colonel Rigby m emancipating the slaves of the Kutchees, without exception, some years ago and the suspense m which they have been held as to the ultimate result of this question may to a certain extent account for their being satisfied with the protection under which they found themselves; but I venture to say, that so soon as it will become known that they may engage in the slave trade by taking their names off the books of the Consulate, the majority of the men of capital now under our protection and control will go over to the Sultan, solely to enjoy the privileges that the laws of Zanzibar afford them with regard to the slave trade. I he demand for slaves would thus increase by at least one third, and the horrors of slavery would acquire a fresh impulse. It is, moreover, well to be prepared for a claim for compen sation when the Kutchees realize the fact that Colonel Rigby, the British Political Agent at Zanzibar, had no right to deprive them of an article of trade, the pos session of which was no crime, neither in the country which they had elected as a residence, nor that from which they had come. 11532. G26 No. 49. No. 1298, dated 6th November 1868. W. S. Seton-Karr , Esq., Secretary to Government of India, Foreign Depart ment, with Governor General, to C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to Government of Bombay. I am directed by His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter, No. 239, dated the 9th of October last, relative to the question of the natives of Kutch who traffic in slaves at Zanzibar, and to their amenability to British law and authority. 2. His Excellency in Council observes that the question of our right to inter fere with the subjects of the Rao of Kutch, who were said to be connected with the slave trade, was, by the letter from this Office of the 22d of April last, left mainly dependent on the nature of the transactions in which these persons engaged, and on their not merely owning and retaining slaves, but on their taking an active part in slave-dealing, 3. The questions suggested in Sir R. Temple's letter just alluded to, have now received a very full answer by the enclosures forwarded with your letter under acknowledgment, and it is quite clear that the subjects of the Rao of Kutch are actively engaged in this traffic in its most revolting form, and that little is wanting on their part but increased facilities to promote this commerce throughout all the west coast of Africa and in the interior. 4. His Excellency in Council has given his most attentive and earnest con sideration to this whole subject, but whatever may be the difficulties of putting down the slave trade when carried on by the Sultan of Zanzibar or his natural- born subjects, His Excellency in Council can have no doubt that it is our bounden duty to interfere with a high hand, and authoritatively to put down slave- dealing when carried on by the subjects of a Native State with whom we have a Treaty, where we have an accredited representative, and which is bound to be guided by the advice and influence of the paramount Power in matters so intimately connected with the very first principles of public morality and justice. 5. In this view, His Excellency in Council desires that you will at once address the Political Agent in Kutch on the subject. The Agent should point out to the Rao the iniquity and cruelty of this traffic, and * See p. 67, Records of the Bombay he should inform him that the British Govern- Govemment, No. XV. ment, which, by the proclamation* issued by the Rao in 1836, had evidently used its authority to prevent the importation of slaves into that principality, will by no means permit any of his subjects, when resident or domiciled in foreign parts, to engage in the slave trade, on the pretence that they have acquired a right to do so either by residing at Zanzibar, or by neglecting or refusing to register themselves before the British Consul at that place. All traders or others, subjects of the Rao, who who are proceeding to Zanzibar, or who are actually residing there, should be warned that, though mere domestic slavery by Kutchees may be tolerated for the present, the British Government will take steps to interfere with any prosecution of the traffic in human beings, and that no claims for loss or compensation, in the event of the release of any number of captives, sold or being hurried into slavery will be listened to for a moment. ™ 6, 1 ®T ba y G o vern ment is further requested similarly to address Mr. Churchill, the Consul and Agent at Zanzibar, to the same effect, and to authorize him to interfere actively and authoritatively, and by all the means at his disposal, to put down slave-dealing when carried on or attempted by Kutchees His Excellency in Council observes that the result of the offer to the subjects of Kutch to register themselves before the British Consul, though undoubtedly well meant, appears to have been unfortunate; as it would seem that the Kutchees, not registered, have conceived the notion that they are emancipated from all control or interference, and that the Sultan himself favours these pretensions. Mr. Churchill should be instructed to inform the Sultan that the Government ofin 27 India by no means recognizes any such claims, and the traders from Kutch should be plainly told that, though the retention by them of domestic slaves in their households may, for a time, be tolerated, all attempts at purchasing, selling, or trafficking in slaves, will be summarily put down, and that this Government will not entertain any claims for redress or compensation. 7. His Excellency in Council is also constrained to say that he can by no means endorse the opinion given by the Bombay Government in the 3d paragraph of your letter dated 31 st of March last, viz., that slavery is no crime either in the country in which these Kutchees reside or in that from which they come. It may unhappily be no crime against the laws of Zanzibar, but it would certainly be a crime if committed in the territories of the Rao of Kutch, and it would be one which, if it occurred on the coast of India, or in any part of the dominions of any of its Chiefs or Princes, would assuredly be dealt with effectively and summarily by the paramount Power. 8. His Excellency in Council further observes that this correspondence raises the question, which has already been discussed, and has been pressed on the con sideration of the Right Honourable the Secretary of State, whether it would not be convenient that the Agent at Zanzibar should be altogether under the Indian Government. The present correspondence will be at once forwarded to Her Majesty's Home Government, and the question will again be pressed on its notice. 9. It is, however, unnecessary to wait for any decision on this latter question before taking active steps with regard to the class of persons now referred to. In the interests of humanity, by the spirit, if not by the actual letter of our treaties, and by the policy which has always guided the Government of India in dealing with these important questions, prompt action and interference are necessary and justifiable, and the Government of Bombay may rely on receiving the most hearty support from His Excellency in Council in all its endeavours to put down a practice which inflicts incalculable misery on a weak and helpless population, and the existence of which is, at the same time, not creditable to the British power and name. % Foreign (Political) Letter from India, dated 21st January (No. 29) 1869.

' I have received and laid before His Excellency the Governor General in Council your Letter, dated 31st ultimo, No. 73, regarding the right of the British Government to interfere with the subjects of the Rao of Kutch, established in Zanzibar, in the matter of offences against British laws for the suppression of the slave trade. 2. It appears to the Governor General in Council that the decision of the question raised, turns on the following issues: I Do the Kutch subjects in question merely own and hold slaves ? II. Or do they deal in and make contracts regarding slaves, involving trans- actions tantamount to slave-dealing P „ ^ . r, -i, III. Does their case resemble that of Messrs. H. A. Fraser &amp; Co., at Zanzibar, which case was held to involve such an approach to slave-dealing as to come under the prohibitions of English statute law ? 3 It may be assumed that the Kutchees are not British subjects in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and that they are in much the same position towards the British Government as the people of Kattiawar. 4 But if the transactions of the Kutchees are found to amount to slave-dealing, then a question will arise as to whether these transactions can be stopped in the same manner as the transactions of Messrs. Fraser &amp; Co., m Zanzibar, weie stopped, the Messrs. Fraser being British subjects. And this question turns on another viz., can the people of Kutch be in this particular respect put on the footing of quasi British subjects ; that is to say, m matters m which the British Government is concerned, as it is in the question of slave-dealing, can that Government, as the Lord Paramount of the State to which their immediate allegiance is due, exercise a check over them in transactions beyond the boundaries of India. 5 The last point will obviously demand legal consideration. But this might well be deferred till the questions of fact have been taken up, and ^ h^s been decided whether the Kutchees are engaged m slave-dealing w not. It the y are merely slave holders, then there would seem to be no sufficient legal warrant for interfering with them. ^ ^ . 6 I am therefore to request that information on the issues of fact above mentioned may be furnished to the Government of India I have, &amp;c., (Signed) R.

This has been pointed out to Mr. Churchill, but, looking to the reason given by him for issuing the order, the Governor in Council will await his turther report. No. 5/26, dated Zanzibar, the 22d January H A Churosill , Esq., C .B., Her Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, Zanzibar, to C. Gonne , Esq., Acting Chief Secretary to the Government ot of Bombay. I received your Despatch, No. 3406, of the 7th ultimo, relative to the possession of slaves by the Kutchees residing at Zanzibar, on the 4th instant, and, although I took an early opportunity of communicating the decision of the Indian Government to His Highness the Sultan, who was on the coast of Africa, at Dar Selam, spend ing the Rammadan, I thought it better to wait until the Sultan's return to Zanzibar, as the delay incurred by this means would have the effect of reconciling His Highness with the stringent measures I purposed taking with regard to the natives of India under his protection. I trust that my having allowed the Indians this short respite, as a mark of deference to His Highness the Sultan, will not be disapproved by the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, although it was, as I am aware, my duty to have acted upon the orders I had received without the least delay. . ,. . . , On the day after the Sultan's return to Zanzibar, and immediately after the ides of Rammadan, I drew up a notice informing the natives of India, who had placed themselves Under His Highness's protection, that they would no longer be allowed to purchase or sell slaves, and that they had to present themselves at the33 Consulate, in order to enable me to determine whether the slaves in their possession were in domestic slavery or otherwise, It will, I fear, be a difficult matter to distinguish between domestic slavery and the real slave trade, as the former may assume the character of the latter at any time, if domestic slavery be kept within certain bounds. Taking my stand, there fore, on the spirit, if not the letter, of His Excellency the Governor General's opinion in this matter, I have decided that no Kutchee slave owner should be allowed to hold more than a very limited number of domestic slaves, say two or three, according to his circumstances. I beg leave to forward, for the information of His Excellency the Governor in Council, a copy of my letter to Seyd Majid on this subject, together with two notices affixed at the Custom House and at the Consulate, that I have addressed to the Kutchees under the Sultan's protection, with reference to the carrying on of the slave trade by them. I shall avail myself of the first opportunity to proceed along the coast, in order to carry out more effectually the wishes of the Indian Government. The total absence at present of any British man-of-war renders my doing so just now impossible, and I doubt whether any of Her Majesty's ships would be available for this purpose, as they come with special instructions from the Commodore. I, therefore, strongly beg to suggest the expediency of sending to Zanzibar a small vessel of the Indian Navy, to be placed at the disposal of the Political Agent. There are many occasions on which a vessel of this kind would be invaluable at Zanzibar, and it would render the Right Honourable the Governor's Agent much less dependent on the Sultan's good will in carrying out the orders of Govern ment. A steam ship would be preferable to a sailing ship, but the latter would be better than none at all, and I urgently venture to press the matter on the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in CounciL No. 20, dated Zanzibar, the 20th January 1869. H. A. Churchill , Esq., C.B., Her Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, Zanzibar, to His Highness Seyd Majid , Sultan of Zanzibar. With reference to Your Highness's letter of the 23d Shaban 1284,* relative to the natives of India under Your Highness's protection being amenable to British law, I have the honour to inform Your Highness in writing, as I have already done verballv, that the Government of India by no means recognize the claim set up by certain'Kutchees and other subjects of the protected States in India, to be eman cipated from all control over them by this Political Agency, on the ground that they have neglected to inscribe their names in the Consular Registers, and I am enjoined to interfere authoritatively, and by all the means at my disposal, to put down slave-dealing when carried on by such persons. The majority of the Kutchees engaged in this illicit trade having placed them selves under Your Highness's protection, it is necessary to inform you that I have, by a public notice posted up at the Custom House and at the Consulate, ordered all Kutchees, and other natives of India residing in Your Highness's dominions who may possess slaves, to present themselves at this Consulate without loss or time, under pain of severe punishment, in order that I may be enabled to carry out the orders of the Government of India. , , v I have the honour to forward to you a copy of this notice, and trust that Your Highness will, on this occasion, as you have always done in other matters of a similar importance, afford me your valuable cooperation in preventing the natives of India, domiciled in your dominions, from continuing a practice which inflicts incalculable misery on a weak and helpless population, and the existence of which is the source of so much pain to Her Majesty's Government. 11532. * Note, . 21st December 1867, Letter given at pp. 21, 22. I34 Notice to all Natives of India in the Dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar. The Government of India having taken into their serious consideration the subject of the possession of slaves, and the carrying on of the slave trade by Kutchees, and other natives of India, in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have deemed it urgent to issue orders to the effect that, although domestic slavery may for a time be tolerated to a certain extent amongst those already possessing slaves, all attempts at purchasing, selling, or trafficking in slaves shall be summarily put down, and the Indian Government will not entertain any claims for redress or compensation on this head. In consequence of the issue of these orders, I, the undersigned. Her Majesty^s Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar, do hereby command all natives of India, who possess slaves in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, to present themselves to the Political Agency, either in person or by deputy, within a limited period of time from this date, namely, within 14 days for the inhabitants of the town of Zanzibar, one month for those inhabiting the island of Zanzibar, and two months for those residing out of the said island, with a list of the slaves in their possession, describing therein the age, sex, and name of each of their slaves, in order that they may be dealt with in accordance with the commands of the Government of India. After the lapse of time allowed to each individual according to his location, unless a good and sufficient excuse be afforded for non-appearance, all slaves found in the possession of natives of India shall be forthwith set free, and the owners thereof shall further be subjected to imprisonment, or to a fine of not less ^10 for each slave so found, or both.

Churchill , Esq:, C .B., Political Agent and Her Majesty's Consul at Zanzibar, to the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. Referring to the natives of India holding slaves in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, I had the honour, in my Despatch, No. 5/26, of the 21st January last, to report the steps that I had taken with a view to put a stop to the trafficking in slaves by the said individuals within the jurisdiction of this Political Agency. I was aware that I could not count upon the cooperation of Syud Majid in carrying out my instructions ; but, however much I required that cooperation, 1 was deter mined to do without it if His Highness withheld it. Soon after the publication of my notices (annexed to my Despatch of the 21st January), a native of Kutch was reported to me as having put up one of his slaves for sale in the market place. The man was one of those protected by the Sultan. I caused him to be arrested and brought to trial. He did not deny the fact, but laughingly declared that he ignored my power to punish him. I sentenced him to a fine of &gt;^500 and to imprisonment in the fort until I could send him out of the C0 Thisdecisive step, which I was prepared to follow up by others of the same nature brought the Kutchees to their senses, and after a serious consu tation among' themselves, many of them, the powerful men, came to the Consulate to declare the slaves they held, while the Sultan, careless of showing his vexation, addressed me a letter couched in very plain words, such as he is not m the habit86 of writing to this Political Agency, in which he protests with energy against my proceedings and threatened to report me. I replied to His Highness on the same day expressing my regret at the line of policy he had been pleased to adopt m this matter, but showing him that I could not abandon the position I had assumed. I took an early opportunity of waiting upon His Highness in person to impress upon his mind the futility of opposing the fulfilment of my instructions. As in the course of this interview. His Highness urged the dissatisfaction of his subiects with himself and this Agency, and his distrust of the maintenance of the public peace if I persisted, I requested the Commander of Her Majesty s ship ' Nymphe ' to remain at Zanzibar until further orders. Matters were in this position, and I had made every preparation to arrest the possibility of the Kutchees in Zanzibar engaging in the slave trade, by depriving them of the slaves in their possession over and above a certain number, when, on the 13th February, I received your letter, No. 146, of the 16th January, by which I am informed that it is unnecessary to interfere with any existing arrangements by which domestic slaves are now actually possessed by Kutchees at Zanzibar for household purposes. From the tenor of this resolution, I concluded that I had misinterpreted the sense of the Governor General's letter to the Bombay Govern ment, No. 1298, of the 6th November, and was going too far in compassing the freedom of any of the slaves holden by the Kutchees, although the possession of more than a certain number of slaves would offer facilities to the trafficking in slaves, which I could not control otherwise than by reducing the number of domestic slaves in the possession of each individual to a maximum, and getting a correct list and description of the slaves thus held. I therefore called the Sultan's Secretary, and, without letting him know that I had overstepped the limits of my powers, I requested him to convey to the Sultan my wish to conciliate matters, and my readiness, considering the assistance we had always received at his hands in putting down the slave trade, to abstain from interference with^ the slaves already in the possession of Kutchees under his protection, provided His Highness would afford me his cooperation in punishing them if they sold or bought slaves in his dominions. His Highness appeared to be gratified at this concession, and on the 20th February I embodied my conditions in a letter to the above effect, to which His Highness has replied by accepting my conditions provisionally, pending reference to the Government of Bombay. I have the honour to forward, herewith enclosed, copies of the correspondence above mentioned. „ , ,, , i. As matters stand, I do not interfere with the slaves actually held by Kutchees protected by Syud Majid, though I have established my right to jurisdiction over them in the event of their engaging in the slave trade. I have offered to press upon the consideration of His Excellency the Governor in Council our non-inter ference with them, if His Highness will punish them himself whenever they purchase or sell slaves. I have reserved to this Agency the right of interference in the event of His Highness being remiss in carrying out his engagement. 1 have further, in accordance with the views expressed by His Excellency the Governor General, closed the door upon future arrivals from India being protected by the Sultan. f , The latter clause is the one most objected to by the Sultan s Government, for it will have the effect of restoring to the British Political Agency the influence and power it formerly possessed, and which was beginning to diminish in consequence of our gradually losing the hold we formerly had over the Indian element of the population, which is considerable in Zanzibar. On the reply that His Excellency will give to the Sultan's deputy, will depend the question whether this influence is to be increased or totally annulled in the course of time. Translation. Dated Zanzibar, 17th Shawal 1285 (the Ist February 1869). From Syud Majid , Sultan of Zanzibar, to Her Majesty's Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar. You addressed us some time since with reference to the Indians under our pro tection, and it was our intention to have answered you, when we learned that you37 had put up a notice at the Custom House without waiting our reply, and now we are informed that you have imprisoned one of the Indians in question. Now, let it be known to you that we protest against this measure, and shall not assist you in compelling our subjects and those under our protection to free their slaves* and, in the event of your forcing them to do so, it will be against our will, and we shall be constrained to address a complaint of such proceedings to Her Majesty's Government. Be this known to you. No. 49, dated Zanzibar, the 1st February 1869. H. A. Churchill , Esq., C.B., Political Agent and Her Majesty's Consul, Zanzibar, to the Sultan of Zanzibar. I have had the honour to receive your Highness's letter of the 17th Shewal, relative to the measures that I have been instructed by the Government of India to take, with a view to putting down the trade in slaves, which, I lament to say, is carried on in your Highness's dominions by certain natives of India under your protection. Your Highness has been pleased therein to protest against the adoption of such measures, and I am informed that I am not to expect any cooperation from you in carrying out my instructions, but that, on the contrary, you will be compelled to complain against me, if I persist in freeing the slaves of the natives of India under your protection. Your Highness will allow me, in the first place, to express my deep regret that ten days should have been allowed to pass without my being informed whether or no I could count upon your Highness's assistance in fulfilling the instructions of Government; and I now see, with much pain, that that assistance which you promised me when the question of the possession of slaves by the natives of India in Zanzibar was first mooted, is now withheld. I would now fain bring to your Highness's recollection the agreement that was then made, namely, that the question should be referred to the Government of India for their decision, promising me your aid in carrying out the wishes of Government, in the event of their being in conformity with my view of the question, and with this result in contemplation, Your Highness was pleased to put up a notice forbidding all natives of India under vour protection from selling their slaves, or otherwise getting rid of them before a reply came, and a list of the slaves of the said Indians was drawn up by your orders to serve as a check against their selling them. If now, after these promises I do not receive at your hands that amount of assistance that is due to the Agent of the British Government, to enable him to carry out his instructions in a proper manner, I shall be under the painful necessity of bringing the circumstance to the serious notice of Her Majesty's Government, who it is needless for me to tell you, will be greatly pained to witness the attitude of your Highness in thi^matter. ^ ^ ^ the least wish to interfere with your Highness's subiects, but the natives of India who, in order to carry on the slave trade, have placed themselves under your protection, are not your subjects, and they cannot be admitted as such. With regard to the individual whom I caused to be arrested for an attempt to sell one of his slaves, he is a native of India, and amenable to British law; and it having been proved before the British Consular Court in his own presence, and' furthermore admitted by himself, that he purposed selling hls slav e ^ the public slave market, by virtue of the powers vested m me by Her Majesty s Government, I have sentenced him to a fine of $500, and to imprisonment until a suitable opportunity offers to send him to India. Should your Highness object to keep the man in the fort, you will be pleased to tell me so. I3&gt; 11532,38 No. 70, dated Zanzibar, the 20th February 1869. H. A. Churchill , Esq., C.B.. Political Agent and Her Majesty's Consul, Zanzibar, to the Sultan of Zanzibar. I have already conveyed to your Highness verbally, through your Secretary, Sulliman-bin-Ali, the course I propose to follow with reference to the Kutchees and other natives of India holding slaves in your dominions; and I now have the honour to inform you in writing that, taking into your consideration your Highness's good will, with regard to the ultimate abolition of the slave trade on this coast, I am anxious to carry out the instructions of the Bombay Gouernment in a manner agreeable to your Highness. With this object in view, I will not object to allow the Kutchees under your protection the possession of the slaves they now hold, as shown in the register kept by Sulliman-bin-Ali, provided they do not buy any more or sell those they have. This concession will have the effect of covering your Highness's amour propre, for so long as the Kutchees under your protection do not traffic in slaves, I shall not interfere with them ; but in order to keep a check over them, I should wish your Highness to order them to give you the names and description of their slaves. Any Kutchee under your protection purchasing a slave, or selling on3, shall be deemed to have committed a heinous crime, and shall be amenable to British jurisdiction; but if your Highness will pledge yourself to punish such individuals condignly, I will gladly suggest to the Bombay Government our non-interfereftce. All future arrivals from India shall be deemed amenable to British law in every way, and there shall be no excuse for their purchasing or holding slaves in your Highness's dominions. I shall also suggest, in compliance with your wishes, that natives of Zanzibar born of Indian parents may be allowed to elect their nationality after coming of age, and that the Kutchees settled in Zanzibar before 1836, the date of the Rao's proclamation regarding the slave trnde, may be permitted to enjoy all the privileges of your Highness's subjects. Translation. Syud Majid , Sultan of Zanzibar, to the Political Agent and Her Majesty's Consul, Zanzibar, dated Zanzibar, 26th February 1869. Your letter has reached us, and its contents have been understood. Our friend Sulliman conveyed to us your verbal message, and it was in exact accordance with the purport of your letter, namely, that you will allow the natives of Kutch to keep what slaves they had, as a mark of deference towards us. We have to express to you our sincere thanks for this. We believe that you are well disposed towards us, and we earnestly trust that the friendship happily existing between us will increase daily ; but the correspondence that passed between our Government and Colonels Pelly and Playfair some time back acknowledges our right to protect all natives of Kutch whose names are not inscribed in the Consular register books kept in Zanzibar, and to consider them as our own subjects in every way. You, however, latterly wished to pursue a different course^ and it was then agreed to refer the matter to the Indian Government. When, a few days ago, you insisted on taking active measures in the matter, Ave purposed sending some one to the Government of India to represent our case. You further state that, in future, all new arrivals from India shall be amenable to British law. We can easily understand that the natives of Bombay and Surat, and other parts of India subjugated by Great Britain, should be subject to your jurisdiction, but that those who came from States that have not been conquered should be amenable to British law is at variance with the explanations previously given by Colonels Pelly and Playfair, namely, that if they have not elected the protection of the British Consulate, by writing their names in the Consular register, their status shall be that of the Arabs, our subjects. Now, however, with a view to the maintenance of the friendly relation between us, we arewilling to accept the position assumed by you, as explained in your letter under present acknowledgment, until such time as our envoy may return from India, when we trust that the most perfect understanding will be arrived at on this subject between us.

Slave Trade Draft, India Office. gi r) Foreign Office, April 5th, 1869. I am directed by the Earl of Clarendon to transmit to you, to be laid before His Grace the Duke of Argyll, the accompanying copies of a Despatch and its enclosures from Mr, Churchill, Her Majesty s Political Agent and Consul at Zanzibar, reporting the steps taken by him for giving effect to the orders of the Governor General of India in regard to the suppression of slave-dealing, as carried on by the Kutchees, or by the subjects of other protected Indian States residing at Zanzibar. . . I am to state that Lord Clarendon is not aware of the precise nature ot the instructions on this subject which Mr. Churchill has received from the Govern ment of India, but it would appear from the tenor of Mr. Churchill's Despatch and its inclosures that it is proposed to tolerate, if not to recognize and allow, the holding of domestic slaves by Kutchees and other protected Indian subjects. His Lordship desires me to observe that, after having once manumitted all the slaves held by protected Indian subjects at Zanzibar, as was done a few years since by Colonel Rigby, to tolerate now the holding of slaves by any Indian sub- iects protected or otherwise, would be a material concession on our part towards slavery, likely to encourage the slave trade, and calculated to place us in a false position towards the Sultan of Zanzibar, whom we have been urging for some time past to adopt stringent measures for putting a stop to the slave tramc in his d0 Lord Clarendon would suggest, therefore, unless there are any Indi an interests involved which would prevent the adoption of such a course, whether a notice might not be issued prohibiting entirely the holding of domestic slaves by Indian subjects, or by the subjects of any Indian State under British protection, allowing them, however, should it be thought advisable to do so, a reasonable period for ffettinff rid of the slaves that may be in their possession. , - g I am further directed to state that, if the Duke of Argyll has the means of furnishinff it Lord Clarendon would request to be supplied with a copy of such part of the Indian Penal Code as prohibits the holding or trafficking in slaves by Indian subjects. The Under Secretary of State for India.40 Copy of Judicial Letter to the Foreign Office. India Office, Si rj 30th July 1869. I am instructed by the Duke of Argyll to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter of the 5th April, relative to the practice by Kutchees of slave-holding at Zanzibar. 2. I am directed to state, that His Grace will willingly cooperate with Lord Clarendon for the discouragement and prevention of slave-holding at Zanzibar, by those who are, directly or constructively, British subjects. There is, however, some difficulty as to the means of dealing with the evil, as the Indian Penal Code, to which allusion is made in your letter, has no operation at Zanzibar; and its provisions, therefore, cannot be made applicable to the acts of the Kutchees resident at that place. 3. The Duke of Argyll inclines to the opinion that the evil can only be con trolled by the influence exercised by Her Majesty's Consul over the Sultan. That Officer should endeavour to prevail on the Sultan to issue a proclamation pro hibitory of slave-holding in his dominions by natives of India, whether they be or be not registered as British subjects. When once such a proclamation has been issued, it will be comparatively easy to enforce its provisions. I am, &amp;c., (Signed) J. C. Melvill. The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

But this traffic having been forbidden by the will of Government, a Proclamation to the effect that if any slaves —negroes or Abyssinians—shall be brought (to Kutch) by any one for sale, the vessel con- veying them with its cargo will be confiscated, was issued by my late father, under date the Maha Vide 5th Sumvut 1892. Notwithstanding this, I am now informed through Major Shortt, the Political Agent at this place, by the Political Agent at Zanzibar, at the direction of Government, that the subjects of Kutch residing at Zanzibar are now engaged in the slave trade. From this it appears that you have not yet abandoned this trade. It is, therefore, hereby ordered that if you persist in the traffic in slaves, the Government will, by virtue of my aforesaid permission, treating you (who reside at Zanzibar) as its own subjects, liberate all slaves from your possession, and will not, however large the number of slaves so liberated, award any compensation whatever, nor entertain any claim in regard thereto; and besides, the perpetrators will be punished there, according to the law there prevailing, and you will also be considered as criminals, liable to punishment here (in my domain). Note this well, and take warning. Given in His Hignness's presence, this 13th day of the 1st Vaisak Sood Sumvut 1925 of the Vikram era. 11532. L42 No. 959, dated Simla, 13th July 1869.

I do myself the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Government Reso lutions noted in the margin*, on the subject * No. 3406, dated 7th December 1868. 0 f t ^ e traffic in slaves, which it appears has : IS: :SjanW 1869. ^tely been carried on by natives of Kutch and others at Zanzibar, and to state that I have laid the whole subject before the Durbar.43 2. His Highness the Rao informs me that he is prepared to adopt any measures in his power that may appear to Government likely to be effective in the sup pression of this odious traffic. 3. He does not seem to have been aware of the circumstances which the cor respondence forwarded to me brings to light. So far as his jurisdiction extends, he has hitherto maintained his engagements * Fide Government Resolutions, No. 3231, on this subject, as, for instance, on a late dated 29th October 1866, and No. 1511, occasion, when an attempt to introduce dated 29th Apnl 1867. some slaves was made by an Aden-Kutchee merchant, they were detained and placed at once at my disposal,* 4. He has, of course, no jurisdiction over theKutchees while living in Zanzibar and, properly speaking, no jurisdiction over them for acts done there, although I doubt not that, if required, unfettered by law as he is, he would proceed against any Kutch subject, accused of this traffic, on coming within his jurisdiction, or revisiting Kutch, but this process would be so cumbrous, from the difficulty ot getting satisfactory proof, as to render it inoperative. 5. Should it meet with the approval of Government, I would suggest that His Highness should write to his subjects in Zanzibar, to be forwarded, through Government, to the Consul, informing them that this trade is forbidden by th laws of Kutch, and that any one engaged in it will, so far as hl s juri 8 dict on extends be subiect to penalties, and in no case will any claim for compensation be entertained on account of loss sustained from the liberation of slaves, or any other cause. 6 But it appears tome that the real difficulty lies at Zanzibar, and that it will not be removed till Government resumes its authority as Paramount Power over the subjects of its tributaries, who never scruple to claim its protection when in difficulty. 7 In my Letter, No. 63, dated 21st July 1865 I stated my opinion ^ regard to the British Consular iurisdiction over His Highness s subjects living at Muscat, (Signed) A.

Suggests also that Government resume its authority as Paramount Power over the subjects of its tributaries, who never scruple to claim its protection when in difficulty, and states that the Opinion expressed in Letter No. 63 of 1865, in regard to the British Consular jurisdiction over His Highness's subjects living at Muscat is generally applicable to Zanzibar.

Resolution. —The orders of the Government of India permit the Kutchees of Zanzibar to retain the domestic slaves now in their possession, while forbidding them to purchase new slaves for the future. The Political Agent's proceedings, in calling for a list of the slaves possessed by each Kutchee, with a view to determining whether they are held as domestic slaves or for the purposes of slave traffic, seem to be in pursuance of the orders of the Government of India, but the order limiting the number of domestic slaves which each Kutchee is permitted to retain goes beyond those orders. This should be pointed out to the Political Agent, but, looking to the reason giyen by him for issuing the order, his further report will be awaited. Copy of this report should be sent to the Government of India. Copy should also be sent to the Political Agent in Kutch for his information, and with the intimation that it would be desirable that the suggestion made in para. 5 of his Letter, No. 13, of the 1st February last, should be addressed to His Highness the Rao.

In the course of a conversation I had with Seyd Majid soon after the arrival here of Her Majesty's ship ' Nymphe,' His Highness having, with reference to the manner in which I proposed to carry out my instructions relative to the Kutchees under the Sultan's protection possessing slaves, expressed in strong terms his misgivings as to the friendly feelings of his subjects towards himself and the Europeans, because of the prevailing belief that Her Majesty's Government would sooner or later end in forcing His Highness to sanction the abolition of domestic slavery in his dominions, an event which would, said the Sultan, bring about the total ruin of the country, I deemed it advisable to request Commander Meara, of the « Nymphe,' to postpone his course south until 1 would see my way through the difficulty. Finding, however, after a lapse of ten days, that His Highness's fears were groundless, inasmuch as the Arabs were quite indifferent if the natives of Kutch held slaves or not in Zanzibar, and that His Highness had only wished to throw difficulties in my way, I authorized Commander Meara to proceed on his cruising I availed myself of his passing by Johanna to request him to grant a passage to Seyd All, the brother of the King of Johanna, who was desirous, with his cousin to return to his native island. I have the honour to transmit to you copies of the letters I addressed to Com mander Meara on this subject, and I trust that my having detained the ' Nymphe ' under the peculiar circumstances described, will meet the approval of Hi's Excellency the Governor in Council.

He then issued a notification to the effect that every one who was a subject of the British Government should appear (before him) and have his name entered in the records of the British Government, and that all those who were subjects of Syud Majid should have their names entered in the records of Syud Majid. This was done accordingly, and each knew who was his subject. This state of things continued until Colonel Pelly left Zanzibar. When Colonel Play- fair arrived, he again had similar entries made in the records, and this state of things continued until his departure. Dr. Seward, who succeeded Colonel Play- fair, also did what his predecessors had done. Afterwards, Mr. Churchill came as Consul to Zanzibar. After a long time he claimed the Hindoos and Banyans as British subjects, and made demands contrary to the proceedings of his prede cessors. He wished that they all should be the subjects of the British Govern ment. The matter now rests in this state, pending a representation from Syud Majid to the British Government as to whether the proceedings of the former Consuls are to be upheld, or whether what Mr. Churchill proposes to do should be done. Syud Majid hopes that the British Government will favour him with replies on these two points. (Signed) Venayek Wassoodew, Oriental Translator to Government. No. 2281 of 1869. Political Department.

Bombay Castle, 28th July 1869. His Excellency the Governor in Council has had under consideration the * Letter dated 23d June last, in which you have stated the objects of your deputa tion by His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar. ***** In the second place, you intimate that His Highness Syud Majid wishes that His Excellency should consider whether the proceedings of the Consul, Mr. Churchill, should be upheld, in that, departing from the practice of his pre decessors, he has declined to recognize any distinction between the Hindoos and Banyans, who have registered themselves as claimants of the protection of the British Government, and those who have not done so, and has treated them all as liable to the laws affecting British subjects. His Excellency in Council understands that the persons to whom you allude are subjects of His Highness the Rao of Kutch, an Indian State under the pro tection of the paramount power of the British Government, and the particular mattfer in respect of which the liability of those persons to the British law has been called in question is the slave trade. I am now directed to inform you that the Rao of Kutch entirely sympathizes with the British Government in their desire that no Indian subject should take part in the slave trade, and His Highness has issued a proclamation, dated 24th April last, which has been published in Kutch and Bombay, and which has also been sent to Zanzibar for communication to the Kutchees of that place, announcing that participation in the slave trade is contrary to the laws of Kutch, 11532. N50 and that all Kutchees so offending, whether at home or abroad, will, with the assent of His Highness the Rao, be liable to punishment in the same manner as British subjects. It is understood that a copy of this proclamation had not been received in Zanzibar at the time when you left, and I am now directed to furnish one for your information. I am finally to request that you will communicate the answers of His Excel lency in Council to His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar. His Highness Syud Majid bin Stud Saeed , Sultan of Zanzibar. My esteemed and honoured Friend, I have received your Highness's friendly letter, dated the 29th April last, informing me that you had deputed two noblemen of your Court, viz., Hamed bin Soleyman and Shaik Mahomed bin Abdulla to confer with me agreeably to instructions communicated to them by your Highness. 2. I had the pleasure of receiving these Envoys on the 22d June last. 3. After attentively listening to their representations, I requested them to be good enough to reduce them to writing, and I now beg to enclose a copy of the answer which I directed to be conveyed to them. 4.

The letter of Mr. Churchill, No. 19/89, dated the 26th February 1869, quoted in Dr. Kirk's 6th paragraph, was communicated to the Government of India with my Letter, No. 143, dated 17th April last. 13 y No. 86/315, dated 16th August 1869. John Kirk , Esq., Acting Political Agent, Zanzibar, to C. Gonne , Esq., Secretary to Government of Bombay. 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in the Political Department, No. 1763, of the 1st June, in which I am instructed to publish in Zanzibar the proclamation lately issued by His Highness the Rao of Kutch for the better government of his subjects and the suppression of the slave trade. 2 I have now the honour to report, for the information of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council, that I took an early opportunity to lay a copy of this Notification before His Highness Syed Majid. 3 His Highness at once perceived its full bearing, and felt that his plans for ffainino- over the Indian community of Zanzibar to himself had failed. While the natives of Kutch established in Zanzibar were under our sole pro- tection and jurisdiction, we held the most wealthy and enterprising among the mercantile community, and our influence was in all matters paramount. Afterwards as a settlement of certain vexed questions connected with the slave trade each Kutchee was allowed to elect his protecting State, and ^s aghness, bv ho'ldinff forward the Arab privilege of buying and selling slaves to all who -is —f s '.-'s registrations at the British Agency have become almost unknown. 11532.4. His Excellency will thus understand that I was quite prepared to find the Rao's proclamation extremely distasteful to Syed Majid, nor was I altogether surprised to receive a very strong letter in reply. This document, however, His Highness laid before me privately, that he might ascertain what effect it was likely to have, before affixing his official seal. In this letter His Highness denied the right of the Rao of Kutch to issue any proclamation whatever to residents in Zanzibar, on the assumed ground that no treaty existed between the two States. He then set forth that the terms of the proclamation could not be conceded, and that, notwithstanding, he would recognize only such Kutchees as registered their names at the British Agensy to be subject to our jurisdiction. 5. In a conversation that ensued, I pointed out to the Wuzeer the fallacies of His Highness's position. I showed him that the Rao was bound by treaty with Great Britain to have no diplomatic relations abroad, and could not possibly enter into independent treaties with foreign powers. In most respectful, yet decided, language, I showed His Highness how very foolish it would be to take up a position which he would be forced to abandon with loss of credit in the eyes of his subjects; that, if His Highness placed this document in my hands officially, I was prepared to bring matters to a crisis, by asserting at once the full powers given me under the Rao's proclamation ; that, besides, he would stand in open antagonism to the will of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay. 6. This remonstrance, I am happy to say, had its due effect. The letter has been withdrawn, or, rather, never officially communicated, and in its stead I have now the honour to enclose a copy, in translation, of the reply received. Herein His Highness simply acknowledges the receipt of the proclamation, without questioning its force, and asks that the minor questions regarding our jurisdiction over the limited number of Kutchees who formerly enrolled their names as under Arab protection may be considered. These questions have been fully explained in Mr. Churchill's letter. No. 19/89, of 26th February, to which I have the honour to refer. 7. The proclamation of His Highness the Rao of Kutch has been accordingly published in town, and copies will be sent, in Arabic and Guzeratee, to the various coast stations where Kutchees are established. 8. I shall, pending further instructions, adopt, but not officially recognize, the spirit of Mr. Churchill's letter above referred to, and retain a neutrality in the case of Kutchees formerly registered under Syed Majid, in all cases not involving slave-dealing. 9. I beg, in conclusion, to state that your former instructions have been care fully noted, and that the state of existing domestic slaves now held by Kutchees will not be interfered with, but that I shall in all cases apply the law whenever any native of Kutch shall be convicted of either buying or selling slaves.

Now we perceive that the Right Honourable the Governor of Bombay in Council has given you orders to lay before us the proclamation of the Rao of Kutch, and this we have also understood.

You are requested to desire Dr. Kirk to communicate the views of the Viceroy and Governor General m Council to the Sultan at a befitting opportunity. rrl . • j 18tb January 1870. . . papers transmitted to me by your Lordship's directions for my perusal and opinion show that, in consequence of the instructions received at various times from the Government of Bombay by the Agency at Zanzibar, an under- standing has been arrived at with the Sultan, to the effect that all trafficking in slaves by Kutchees and other natives of India in His Highness's dominions shall henceforward be put a stop to; that Her Majesty's Agency shall not interfere with the slaves held by the Kutchees under the Sultan's protection, provided the said Kutchees do not engage in the slave trade; and that the Sultan shall take upon himself to punish such persons engaging in the slave trade in his dominions, failing which Her Majesty's Agency shall be entitled to interfere. Further, the Rao or Ruler of Kutch, by a proclamation recently issued, has declared to his subjects residing abroad that they are to consider themselves as being under the jurisdiction of Her Majesty's Government, and the Rao's subjects have been informed that they are amenable to British law. The correspondence relating to the Kutchees possessing slaves in Zanzibar offers, it will be readily admitted, a striking instance of the inconvenience arisino- from the duplex authority under which the affairs of Zanzibar have hitherto been placed. In the time of Colonel Rigby, in compliance with the general tenor of the instructions received by that Officer, the whole of the Kutchees and other natives of India established in the Sultan's African territories were deprived of their slaves, and Colonel Rigby's proceedings received the approval of Her Maiestv's Government. Later, the Sultan was allowed to take under his protection those natives of Kutch who did not seek British protection, and, since that permission was granted, few Kutchees have applied for British protection, preferring the Sultan's rule under which they can buy slaves. The Order in Council of the 9th August 1866 seemed, moreover, to confirm this arrangement, by declaring all natives of India and others to have forfeited their right to British' protection who had not entered their names in the Consular register. It is undoubtedly on official decla rations that the Sultan and the Kutchees base the right of the latter to buy and sell slaves. Soon after my arrival in Zanzibar, taking my stand on the broad views suo-- gested in the instructions from the Foreign Office, I called on the Sultan to cause all the slaves beld by the Kutchees under his protection to be emancipated, but His Highness Seyd Majid demurred at my request, and urged me to* refer the matter to the Government of Bombay. The instructions received from Bombay by the Agency led to the understanding referred to in the early part of this Despatch, whence it will be observed that, while all trafficking in slaves has been strictly prohibited, the holding of slaves for domestic purposes has been sanctioned by the Government of India, and in one of the latest communications from Bombay64 C4th August 1869) the Political Agent is enjoined to avoid, as much as possible, the expression of opinions as to purely domestic or household slavery when practised in Zanzibar by Kutchees or others. „ I look upon this question as one of great importance. It is a question of con sistency from two different points of view, namely, whether, while Her Majesty s Government is calling on the Sultan of Zanzibar to put a stop to the slave trade, thev can allow natives of protected States of India to hold slaves in His High- ness's dominions or elsewhere, and whether, not having checked these proceedings from the commencement, but, rather having tolerated them, Her Majesty s Government can now come forward and prevent Kutchees from holding slaves. And if thev allow them to hold slaves, the next question that arises is as to how far Her Maiesty's Government would be justified in preventing the said individuals from buying and selling slaves, or, in other terms, from engaging in the slave trade, in the Sultan's dominions. ' , ^ In my humble opinion, the less we countenance the holding of slaves by the Kutchees the better, but the difficulty will be to reconcile this view with that already taken by the Government of India, and communicated to the feultan by theirAgent - I have, &amp;c., (Signed) H.
