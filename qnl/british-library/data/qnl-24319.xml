In this connection I enclose a cony of the receipt for the rent actually paid, namely, Rs. 44/- for the period as stated in the receipt.

May I suggest that the tax, if any, due for the remaining portion of the month of Dul 'adah should not be recovered from me out the person who occupied the house or from the landlord, as the case may be. Frr your information, may I add that I have entered into a contract with my landlord to oay rent according to the English calendar month.
