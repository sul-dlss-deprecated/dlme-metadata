Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th Dtcembtr 1jo5. From: - To:- Li ut&lt; n nt-Colonel Gordon, joe ., C.I.. •, Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bu^ir&lt; . l!r* Muhaarnvd Ishao. Overseer r Public :or^3 I(.DLrtment * Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the bad work by the Overseer of the Public Works par tin nt, Mr. Ifuhaiiraad Ish?q, about some of which I spoke to t^t Assistant Inglneer when 1&gt;€ parsed tnrough Bahrain recently. In May 13?5 a v ooden stairway was made leading from tue ground floor of the Agency to the Confidential Oft ice. I attach (A) i note about a long and dt. j. defect of ary rot wuicn has come to light. T ;re is no « oubt \ natever eit .er (a) t .at the Overse- r was guilty of gross carelessness in neglecting to inspc ct the wood to be used, or (b) t :.t ^ did In: . ect it ana still allowet it to be used calculating that the paint would loo it. I send a box o; £o&lt; cin.Lns of the vood. ?. I enclose a comparison (B) between an estimate lor painting a room in the Victoria Memorial uospital as submitted by the Overseer and the cost as carried out under loctor ^olmes 1 supervision. The comparison is Rs.SO/ll/- to its. 1-/IS/-. work was perfectly simple painting end should not nave been so over-estimated. I should explain t at this was part of a large estimate so which appeared/ridiculously high tUat I Cet( rmined to c d the /work2- vork by local err&amp;ngenent• 4, I enclose a copy (C) of noting shoving carelessness In keeping three plywood boug it for lining the offices. I *ave specific orders in vriting for the stacking of this v.ooci on t it d is in Court room. It v.as actually pi^ea off tat a:-is and in a corner so that two sides of the pile were toac^in^ v.alls which v.'ere running vith damp, rust from the ironite v.ith which the v.alls had been treated and corrupting ^aint. T. ere is no excuse for this carelessness. 5* I enclose a copy (D) of noting about a vork in the Agency shoving that the Overseer either did not know the elementary fact titat three plyv ood warps if it is .a in ted and is not laid flat or that he die knov it and cid not, though lie states that ne inspected the v .ood after it was paintec, have them laid flat (although he alleges in his note of the 1st December that he had given orders for the wood to be laid on the ground)• 6. The Overseer takes no trouble to see that the carpenters co their vork. On a work which included some Venetian shutterir * I found that the work v .as so bad that I had myself to direct the Overseer to dismiss the carpenter, he should either nave insisted on better vork or should have brought this inferior vork to notice. On another occasion I found that the next carpenter engaged was vasting his time trying to saw v .ith a completely blunt saw. I summoned the Overseer and had the sav sharpened and set. These are petty enough matters, but arc the kind of points that any good overseer would see to. ,7. The Overseer will no doubt say that good carpenters are difficult to get. This is true, but docs not excuse his '/&lt;: HomingailovIng Inferior vork to be done vithout reporting it • i e has at present (pending section to various ropo:»&amp;ls novt be fore the vovcrnm'.nt of India) little or no V;ork to do, so that there is no excuse for his Cc-reiessness# 8# The vorks Thich have been dont; recently arc of an easy and petty nature, but^ I should be cost um.i.iing to entrust to him any of the proposed v-orks, such as the new ving of the / ncy, t/i Indian Assistant's Court or the servants' uarters. J# In 11 the circumst mces, I be' that Mr^Muramm c. Isnaq ma: be removed at once from F? firain and t:-at he ma^ ik-ver be sent back. 10. I understand that ti e Assistant i-nginei r is , r ^area, if you have no objection, to replace him by another Overseer short .y returning from lei.ve#Enclosure r A n , I should like nn ex lanatlon by Mr. j4inc.mnk~u Isi aq vhy rotten vood v.as used for the handrail of the stair Iea( ing up to the Confidential Office. The v.ood is so rotten as to be povdery and the fault extends for some couple of feet at intervals. It s deep and obviously T.as visible when the vood was put in as in places there Is oni^ the jaint over it, 10/1 736. A.P.A to see. G .A.C.-10/12. Mr. Muhammad Ishaq# P.A. c I beg to explain that the stair case leading up to the Confidential Office vas completed in May last and I can only assure you that there vas no sign of any defect whit soever in the vood used for the handrail when it vas put in. If the defect in the wood v-as visible during the progress of the work I would never have allowed this v.ood to be used as it was a matter of about Rs«3/- only. It appears that trie wood was rotten from inside and no one noticed the fault till the recent visit of Sir Andrew Ryan when big wooden cases were carried up through this stair case so carelessly which damaged the hand rail and the next morning the rotten wood vas noticed* M. Ishe i i C Q . y 10/1S/1935. I cannot accept this explanation* had the slightest care been taken in choosing the wood, this defect must have been noticed. The pieces which I have removed show that the rotten (it is dry rot) state of the wood must have bten visible. g.i ,.- le/is/iass. ■I MM .

T v e fact that emerges from this is tinat either the Overset r did not know that plyvood vill warp v.hen painted and should be kept flat or that he did know this elementary fact and did not carry out his over -3e&lt; ing duties projerly* 2/12/Zb.Confldentlf1 , r.o.iioic/7-?/n.

Mr. Muhammad lahaqm Overseer, Public V/orks Department j,mm v, lth reference to my letter No:C/615-3/ll dated the 17th December 1938 and to my conversation ^ith the honourable the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf during his recent visit to Bahrain, I have the honour to inform you that the late Overseer, Mr. Muhammad Ishaq, vas in charge of making a Venetian shuttered enclosure on the roof of the kitchen of the Bahrain Agency. £• As reported in paragrr h Noi6 of my letter the shuttering was very badly made and the slats so fixed that it ^as ^osslbxe to see in from beloT; for a long distance round, ^t is true that I wanted the slrts slopping down on the outside so that rain would flov. away, but this merely necessitated their being ilxea at a different angle, ^his wes got over by reversing the shutter. 3. I warned the Overseer that the enclosure needed anchoring, but he informed me that it was quite strong enough to withstand even a strong shamal. I insisted upon having anchoring, '^he enclosure was blown down and I recorded the following note to the Assistant Political Agent at the time;- /'Ihe2. n The Overseer was found and 1 told him to reiort to you tonrarrovi' morning. I told him yesterday or tne day before that the shuttering needed anchoring or the first real slu mal would blow it dov.n# iiis excuse is that they were going to fix it this erternoonj -'ut the wind was too hi^h. The crass stupidity Un vie* of this strong wind) of leaving the shuttering unfixed instead of laying it flat on the roof does not seem to have struck him. Incidentally the fall of one 01 ^ the shatters from the roof has destroyed the electric cab .e connection of the (I think) S.P. Ill's house. Had my servants been passing below v,and they are continually passing to and fro as the roof is that of the kitchen,), one might easily have been hurt or even killed. This and any further note that you may make .should be submitted to me on my return, with the p*p. n 4. It ?;ill be seen from the note that, apart from his ignorance in thinking that a shutter/,of this kind would stand unahchored, he was guilty of gross neglect in leaving it standing in such a high wind. 5. The Overseer was also ordered in writ Ing at once to arrange for the repair of an electric line which hac been broken by the fa 1 of the enclosure. He states that he telephoned to Mr. Steele's office (which was, of course, shut at the time, 18.?0 hours) end that he went to get a v.ireman, who said that he could not vork without orders from ^r. Steele, ^he verseer made no attempt to report this to me or to the Assistant Political Agent (of office) so that we could comirunicate with Mr. Steele.

' i\S QopTlcLentlal N0.626-S. British Besidency and Oonsulate -Greneral, Bushire, 2nd June 1942. From - The Hon^le Lieut,-Colonel V.R. Hay, O.I.B., Politioal Resident in the Persian G-ulf, To - The Secretary to the Government of India, Bxternal Affairs Department, New Delhi, Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram liro.411-Bf dated the 13th May, and to say that tne antecedents of the Danish engineer referred to have not yet 'been verified 'by His Majesty's Legation, Tehran, 'but that I do not in any case consider him as a suitalDle candidate in all respects as he is a mechanical rather than a constructional engineer. I there fore propose that for the duration of the war the Persian Oulf Independent suh-division of the Public Works Department should 'be closed and its funds for minor works and special repairs placed under my direct control as a contract grant, such of the T . W. D. staff as it is necessary to retain 'beir^ amalgamated for the time 'being into the Residency office staff and 'brought on to the Persian Gulf cadre. These posts are noted in the attached Proposition Statement. 2. This proposal has 'been prompted largely 'by the difficulty experienced in finding a suitable Assistant Engineer. The present incumbent, Mr. Murtaza, wishes to volunteer for mili tary service and asked to 'be relieved in the autumn of 1940, since when all efforts to find a properly qualified successor have completely failed. It is most undesirable that icr. Murtaza should 'be retained in the Gulf any longer against his will. 3. It is also considered that in war time when for lack of material and other reasons construction and repairs are reduced to a minimum it is uneconomical to retain the present rather top heavy P.W.D. staff. Lack of transport also makes inspection difficult and greatly reduced the value of an inspecting officer. As shown 'below my proposals will effect a saving of Es.24,320 on establishment alone. 4. The Proposals will throw a certain amount of extra responsibility on political Agents and other executive officers * but it is considered that in present circumstances petty repairs can probably be carried out more expeditiously and economicall; ' under their direct control than through the intervention of the P.W.D. 5. The only original works of Importance in view at preserr are the re-construction of the Khorramshahr Consulate and the building of a hospital at Dubai. If the proposal to re construct the Consulate is proceeded with, which seems at present unlikely, some special local arrangement nill have to be made. It is proposed to place an overseer in charge of the work on the Dubai hospital, and I am of opinion that the Politioal Agent, Bahrain, and the Residency Agent, Sharjah, will be able to exercise the necessary Mount of supervision. 6. My detailed proposals are as followss- (i) The abolition of the post of Assistant Ingineer, Persian Gulf Independent sub-division. The pay of the present incumbent of the post is K s .690 plus allowances of fc.170. Saving of Rs.10,320 per annum. / Ui) ym'1 - 2 - (n) The a do 11 tl on of the poet ocf Acoountant at present provided by the Accountant General, Central Eevenues. (This post will Decome unnecessary, as the special repairs and other grants will 'be administered as contract grants 'by the Hesident. The pay of the present incumhent of this post is Rs.200 plus /A allowaooes of 8s. 150. Saving of Es.4,200 per annum. It is suggested that in order to simplify accounts procedure, after the abolition of this post, the grants - if any - for original works should 'be managed as a contract grant under my own supervision, (ill) The amalgamation of the P.W.D. office with the' Besidency office. In detail, this involves (a) The transfer of Messrs. Nawazish Ali (P.W.D. accounts clerk) and Mukhtar Yasain (P.W.D. clerk) to the Persian G -ulf clerical cadre. Their present pay is Rs.150 plus allcwranoes of 1^.75, and it is proposed that they should 'be brought in as Lower Division clerks at the level of L.160 plus the standard Lower Division allowaaces of gs.65. Subsequently, they nay 'be promoted in the Persian Oulf cadre in the same way as other clerks, subject to their satisfying the Hesident of their capabilities • This would necessitate the provision of two Upper Jb (initially Lower) Blvision posts on the Persian Gulf Beaidency cadre, in place of the two present posts on the cadre of theP.V.D. Tinancial effect, nil. (h) The abolition of the P .V.D. travelling allowance grant of fis.7,500 per annum, and Increase of the Hesidency travelling allowance grant 'by Es.5,000 per annum (cf. paragraph 9 below), producing a saving of Es.2,500 per annum. x (c) The abolition of the P,¥.!)• contingent allowa ice of Ro.^,700 and. of the P.W.JD. office and petty estab lishment grant of R s .11,500 and the increase of the Besidencv Office Allowance by Js .6,000 producing a nett saving of Rs.8,200* (ir) The transfer of the present Assistant Engineer^ house from the P.W.D. to the Residency. The provision of a house for the Vioe-Oonsul, Bushire, has been due for some years, since the post was taken over from the Foreign Office; and the present Assistant Engineer's house would be adequate. No financial adjustment between the departiuents concerned need, it is suggested, be made, as the rental value of the house will be covered many times over by the cos ted value of the services randered by the officers of the Bxternal Affairs Department in the administration of P .W.D., funds. Also the house can, if necessary, reveff-t to the Assistant Bngineer if the appoint ment i9 rerlved after the war. No rent is at present paid by the Assistant Engineer for the occupation of the house and the financial result of the transaction will be nil. (v) The post of Superviaor, Bushire, should, it is suggested, by made a selection post, and should carry an additional allowance of Rs.75 as in the absence of an' Assistant Enrineer its incumbent will have increased responsibilities, and will be primarily responsible for giving technical advice to the Resident and Secretary. The post is at present suitably filled. ' i i'f t- H . . , (ri) The current expenses and income of the electric A light plants at Bushire and Muscat, and of the water supply organisation at Bushire as well as the income occasionally derived from letting quarters in the Consulate building at Bush ire, the rsnt of the pout office at iiuooat, and the tennis co^ntIP - 3 - court at Kuwait, should 'be aooounted for up to the end of the present financial year under Special Kepalrs, and thereafter In a separate profit and loss account, Eeplace- ments (when necessary / may 'be governed 'by the same considera tions as those governing repladements of launches, motor cars or other machinery maintained 'by contract grants. 7. The nett financial effect of the proposals given alsove is a saving of 8s^4,320 per annum, vide the proposition statement attached. 8, One post of overseer on iis.120-5-150 plus allowances of •^•60 -oer mensem and the post of draftsman on 1530-5•200 plus allowances of Ss.85 have 'been vacant since March 1939 and Mav 1941 respectively* In order that the new scheme proposed may T&gt;e a success it Is most desirable that these posts should De filled as soon as possible and I would seie-ei- solicit the assistance of the Government of India in finding suitable candidates. 9, If It Is at all possible I should 'be very grateful if the aovprnment of India could depute from time to time, say once a year if possible, an Sxecutive or Assistant Xnglneer ;o Inspect the various buildings and report on their condition and generally to offer advice onT.T.D. matters to the Political Resident and his subordinate officers. The object of retaining as large a sum m Ss # 5 f 000 from the P.W.D. travelling allowance grant - vide paragraph 6(iii)(b). is to make provision for the travelling expenses of such an officer. 10. If these proposals are approved in principle I request that I may kindly be informed accordingly by telegram so that I can release Mr. Murtaza, fide paragraph 2. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant. Sd.W.R.Hay.
