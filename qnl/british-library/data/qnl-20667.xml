Po 1 11 i c a 1 ( E xter-aal) D ep, It (N.B. Fliis is ini ongmal message, sent Fy air mail to save telegraphic expense, but intended to be treated on receipt with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed. It has been drafted as if it were so despatched.) From Secretary of State. Kuwait Oil Company have stated in strict •onfidence that in the course of drilling evidence of sulphur deposits has been found sufficient to warrant further investigation with a view to commercial development. The American interests in the Company are thinking of seeking a concession from the Sheikh for the exploitation of the sulphur. Its existence has not yet been reported to His Highness as required under Article 15(A) of the Company’s agreement, but it is proposed that Rhoades, a Director of the Company, should take this step on his approaching visit to Koweit and endeavour to negotiate a concession. 2* In reply to an enquiry the Company have been informed that, although the Sheikh has no specific undertaking with His Majesty’s Government regarding sulphur, it would be in accordance with the general tenor of his agreements to seek our advice and approval before granting a concession, and that we should expect that he would do so. keep the Political Agent informed of the course of the negotiations. They are specially anxious that nothing should be said to the Sheikh on the subject until it has been broached with him by Rhoades. You should therefore treat the information in paragraph 1 above as secret for the time being. But in the meantime I should be glad of your Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Government of India, External Affairs xternal Affairs Department and Political Agent, Koweit. xersian Gulf, repeated to Dated 27th January, 1940. Political Ag No. P.Z. 64/40. The Company have been advised to ask Mr* Rhoades to preliminary/2. preliminary views and those of the Government of India on the question of granting a concession for the production of sulphur in Koweit hy the Kuweit Oil Company, or the American partners therein, if applied for. Question whether we should seek to prescribe any conditions (e.g. as to the disposal of the products) may also require consideration in due course. I should also 'be glad of your views and those of the Government of India as to v/hether when the Sheikh has been approached by Rhoades we should take steps to bring His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in the matter, as stated in paragraph 2, to the notice of His Highness at a convenient opportunity. 4. Subject to any views the Government of India may wish to express on this letter, and on the assumption that it should not be difficult to arrange that any sulphur produced is offered for marketing in India, it does not seem necessary to endeavour to negotiate a pre-emption agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company in respect of sulphur, as is generally done in respect of oil. It is understood that sulphur is a material of considerable importance, directly and indirectly, in the prosecution of the War; and as most of the supplies are drawn from foreign sources, at the cost of foreign exchange, it seems desirable that production within British or British-protected territories should be increased. It may be? therefore, that the Sheikh and the Company should be given encouragement towards the successful negotiation of a concession and the early exploitation of the mineral in question. The issue of the above has been duly authorised.86 / Telegram From To No.T/122. Dated the Q. Political iiesident, in Nearchus.

The fact that Rhoades has coroe to Kuwait to negotiate on behalf of an American concern should convey to Shaikh an impression of acquiesence of His Majesty’s Govern ment. 1 think we should imagine surely this is so for Shaikh is probably secretly pleased (in view of preponderance of local opinion of superiority of American Oil Companies over British) at arrival of an American and we should make it plain that this is only at His Majesty’s Government's acquiesence for Shaikh should not be allowed to think for a moment that His Majesty’s Government do not take full interest in Kuwait. 4. In view of slowing up of Kuwait Oil Company’s operations Shaikh proposes to demand speedy exploitation which from what i have gathered from Rhoades the tfulf Company are not contemplating.

If we do not now inform Shaikh that Rhoades' visit is with approval of His Majesty's Government the Shaikh may think His Majesty's Government are not insisting on general tenor of agreements and are allowing him to negotiate with whom he will, which I think would be unfortunate especially in view of his attitude (see paragraph 2 of my telegram No.C/57 of ^ .

Rhoades has now submitted drafts of the Agreements he hopes to make with the Shaikh for the exploitation of sulphur in Kuwait. The first is an optional Agreement for a period of two years to he followed by a working agreement for a period of seventy five years. 3. The Agreements are drafted on the lines of the Kuwait Oil Company’s Agreements and the general clauses are identical. Points of interest now are: (a) The Company propose to pay the Shaikh Rs. 50,000 on signature of the Option. In the working agreement (b) A total royalty of twelve annas a ton of sulphur mined is to be paid to the Shaikh. (c) There is no clause for minimum yearly payment, c.f. article 3 of Kuwait Oil Company’s Agreement. (d) Drilling programme is the same as the Kuwait Oil {Signature) Company’s/ (Designation) S. 44. MFP—985 S&amp;P —(M-1597)—27-11-36—10,000.-2 Company’s programme - c.f. article 2 of their Agreement. My comments are on (a) The Shaikh will prohahly demand a larger sum. (t&gt;) This sum is, I believe, very low. (c) Shaikh will probably suggest a figure and Bhoades does not expect draft to stand in this respect in its present form. (d) Number of feet to be drilled is the same as agreed upon for the Kuwait Oil Company but result will be roughly four times as many wells since sulphur is expected at 1,000 feet whereas the oil is at 4,000 feet. 4. I should be grateful if possible if I could be given some guide as to what sum Shaikh mighu reasonably be expected to be paid in respect oi royalty. 0 ^^ Political Agent, Kuwait.* Hr GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

My views in regard to the points raised in the Express Letter are as follows. (a) In view of the fact that the Shaikh has given no specific undertaking to His Majesty's Government in regard to sulphur, and as he has spontaneously informed the Political Agent th&amp;t he will seek our advice, I do not think it necessary to bring to his notice the attitude of His Majesty's Government as stated in paragraph 2 of (Signature) / your (Designation) S. 44.

There is, however, little hope of persuading the Shaikh to insist on this because (a) the British interests in the Kuwait Oil Company have shown no interest and (b} the Shaikh thinks that British Companies, unlike American, are inclined to procrastinate. The most we can hope for is to prevail on the Shaikh to insist that the Company should be registered in the British Empire, e.g. Canada. Possibly the main advantage of such a provision would be that it would seem in some way to indicate His Majesty's Government’s interest in the profitable development of Kuwait, and to underline their dominant position. (c) As regards the imposition of any conditions regulating the disposal of the Company's products, this is a matter which depends on market conditions varying from time to time, and one on which it seems to me the Company would be very reluctant to bind itself. The simplest solution would appear to be the negotiation, if possible, of a pre-emption agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. (d) In view of the importance of sulphur in connection with the war, 1 agree that the Shaikh and the American interests in the Company should be given every encouragement towards the negotiation of a concession and its early exploitation. Political Agent reports that he understood from Rhoades that his principals did not contemplate early / exploitation* 0 exploitation, and as the Shaikh is particularly anxious for this he will welcome the support of His Majesty’s Government on this point. sd.

(b) Shaikh’s desire to avoid signing an Agreement which does not provide for commercial production within a specified period.

Tith regard to (a) and (h) it is possible that a redraft of the relevant clauses may ensure commercial prod uction at an early specified date. Holmes, at the Shaikh’s request is already considering this point, though Bhoades* attitude to this proposal is not yet known. Meanwhile it is suggested that His Majesty’s Government might con sider whether they could take any steps to encourage the Company to exploit with a view to early commercial pro duction. b. r ith regard to (c), I am not aware of the conditions j. expecting the disposal of the sulphur which His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India may have in mind. Should His Majesty’s Government eventually decide to con clude a pre-emption agreement with the Company, it will he of little value to tnem in the prosecution of the war unless commercial production is ensured by some method or other. b&lt;n s' r 6. ,ith regard to (d), please see paragraph 3(e) of my telegram Ho.100 of 9th March 1940. is the appointment of a Chief Local Representative for the Kuwait Oil Company has not, in my opinion, proved useful, I consider that no provision is necessary in the new Igreement. 7.

The Shaikh of Kuwait has asked the Political Agent for the advice of Hie Majesty’s Government on the draft agreement, particularly as to the adequacy of the royalty proposed. He is anxious to receive this advice as soon as possible in order that he may not lose rental through delay in concluding the agreement. The Company, it is under stood, wish to conclude the agreement by the end of this mojith. 3. My comments on the draft are as follows *- KIRST SQHLDULS . Preamble. It is understood from Rhoades that the Eastern Gulf Company has not yet been formed but that this will be done by the end of this month, and that it is to be registered in London. This is satisfactory, vide paragraph 3 (b) of my Express Letter Mo.0/198, dated the 7th March 1940. Article 1 .

C/198 and C/210, dated 7th and 10th March 1940 respectively. The military authorities in India are greatly interested in an adequate supply of sulphur being available and this is also essential for general trade requirements. No sulphur is produced in India, as supplies hitherto have been obtained mainly from Italy, Japan and the United States of America. It is understood there are also large deposits in Java, 2. In these circumstances we consider that the Sheikh of Kuwait should be advised to give every encouragement towards the successful development and exploitation of sulphur in his territories. 3. The Political Resident states that the British interests in the Kuwait Oil Company are not interested in the exploitation of sulphur. In order to retain some control he suggests grant of concession to American Company registered in Canada, a solution which would probably commend itself to American interests, and on these terms we see advantage in the proposal. We have not yet received a**’ y£&gt; % Priori final views on the subject of desirability of pre-emption agreement and we will telegraph further on this point when we receive them.4 Reference paragraph 2 of your Express letter We understand that Shaikh has already asked the Political Agent for advice as regards acceptance of sulphur agreement and judging by deposits already known in Kalat State $ Afghanis tan and Iran, would very likely prove to be of very low grade, in which case there is little hope of commercial development while supplies of better quality are available from elsewhere.

The views expressed hy the Government of India are in direct opposition to those held hy Hhoades. I have not, of course, discussed sulphur with Hhoades in connection with the above paragraph, hut can defi nitely say that he does expect to find what he calls w free sulphurand in definitely marketable quantities. He has mentioned to me that sulphur deposits in Persia, Bahrain and, much near home, in Saudi Arabia are not a proposition, hut from what has been discovered during examinations of Kuwait oil-well cores he is as hopeful as any one could he of good commercial results here.

Kuwait sulphur. 2. Subject to what follows there is no objection to grant for concession on the lines'proposed with Government yf * A of India (letter dated March 27th) that Shaikh should be advised to give every encouragement towards successful and early development and exploration sulphur in Kuwait. The Company’s representatives should be informed that His Majesty’s Government as well as Shaihh are anxious that sulphur deposits should be investigated and exploited as soon as possible. They think therefore that the Company should be pressed to reduce materially the option period of two years or at any rate to press on them investigations with a view to deciding as early as possible whether to take up concession and in modification of Article 2 (a)(i) of second schedule to undertake an obligation to drill 4000 feet in one year. If agreement is modified in these two respects His Majesty’s Government have no objection to grant of concession on the understanding that Company would be willing to enter into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government to cover such points as might be considered necessary in order to safeguard the latter’s interests such as the points (including preemption) covered by Political Agreement relating to oil concession mentioned in para 5 of your Express Letter of March 20th No;C/268. — ft *a, 3. Witk reference to comment in your express letter of March 20th on Article 3 second schedule it is difficult to advise. Demi official letter from Ministry of Supply states that American producers in Texas pay a State tax of 2 dollars hut that meets obviously more than could be expected in Kuwait and tentatively suggest Shaikh might try for a higher rate than that in draft agreement say in the neighbourhood of two shillings six pence. Shaikh will be in best position to judge how far he can safely press matter and would presumably not wish to do so to the point of causing Company to break off negotiations.

I have discussed matter v/ith Rhoades who will undertake to reduce option period to one and a half rfe F eat one and a half years from date of signature. Rhoades explains that this is the very minimum in which he can obtain definite information as to exploitability of sulphur deposit which is a twofold question (a) concentration of deposits and (b) bringing sulphur to surface. (a) ie to be determined by drilling and ib) by installation of plant for 'RRASH* process of extraction by hot water, in present circumstances as it will be a problem to get any equipment on the ground within nine months Rhoades states he cannot possibly make any further reduction. 3. As for Article 2 la) commencement of drilling obligatory. Rhoades will now undertake to drill first 4000 feet before third anniversary but cannot undertake to drill any given amount in any one year as drilling is the only one estimable?in campaign. The programme now suggested seems to me should meet His Majesty’s Governments purpose for it will serve ncjuseful purpose to push on with drilling unless necessary plant under (h) is also in operation and Rhoades / v/illSP^ - 2 - TsilX want to drill 2000-30C0 feet in his initial investiga tions, results of which if satisfactory will leave him with halance to drill under second schedule. ^This will mean that e*&amp;^STphur will continue at same rate which Rhoades states cannot be increased without duplication of equipment which cannot be justified until results are known and also no margin would be left in case of emergencies such as breakdown. 4. Rhoades will be willing to enter into agreement with His Majesty's Government as mentioned in India Office telegram No.2021 and beyond obviously necessary modifications e.g. Article 2 wishes to discuss Article 3. ihis allows employment of United States of America nationals but he would it like/to be more specific in this respect* - Political.

D.O. /13. 3rd February My dear Galloway, I enclose herewith Bass* report in connec tion with the Sulphur at Burgan, from \^hich it may be seen that though the surface phenomena may be considered to indicate favourable conditions for the occurrence of sulphur, its existence cannot be predicted from this source. The discovery was made fortuitously from the well samples and I believe I am right in saying that most of the discoveries made in the U.S.A have occurred in a similar manner. ’Whilst traces of sulphur have occurred in all our wells, those in Mo. 8 and Mo. 6 wells have been very meagre and, as Bass mentions, it has not been possible to correlate them from one well to another, thus little can be deduced at the present time, as to the extent of the deposits. Since these lie in porous and fissured water-logged lime stone, they could not be mined and are only producable by t the ifrasch process. Tours sincerely, Sd. L.D. Scott. 1941. Major A.0. Galloway, OBE., Political Agent, Kuwait.\fagwa, Kuwait. January 31st, 1941. Mr. L.D. Scott Kuwait. Below at your request I have very 'briefly summarized for the Government of India the information re: sulphur that the Kuwait Oil Co. Ltd has incidentally noted while searching for oil in Kuwait State: Kuwait State is entirely covered with a thick series of gatchy sands and gravels which completely blanket all oldei geologic formations. Therefore surface evidences as to what might be found re: sulphur at depth are entirely limited to evidences of hydrogen sulfide gas. Emanations of this gas are well known in the vicinity of Kadaniyat, and result in effloresences of sulphur on occasional gatchy surface rocks in the area. Bocks with similar effloresences are found in the Burgan Kills and perhaps elsewhere in the State, finally, at Ain al Abd in the Neutral Ibne just south of Kuwait State, there are large springs of sulphur water (water with nydrogen sulfide) which arise to the surface and flow down to tne Persian Gulf. In addition to these evidences of hydrogen sulfide gas, the Kuwait Oil Company has obtained direct information re sulphur itself from study of the •ditch samples' which we collect as regular routine at five foot intervals during me drilling of our oil wells. Tiny 'cits ot bright yello_« crystalline sulphur have shorn up in these ditcn saaples in Qmoi i nprcenta&amp;es along witn other rocks in all six oi ^ Ss SfeHo date louth of Kuwait Bay in the Burgan area. occurrences are mostly limited to the uppermost 1500 feet of Sti^aphic section, which interval is dominantly rocene limestone cut horizontally through the midnla ^y J- br-d of anhydrite 300 feet thick. These limestones occasional- if carry somehitumen, and in the Burgan area they invariably clrrylarle quantities of very salty sulphur water The individual horizans in which sulphur has been ^ tllick: -nrominent from the ditch samples are some 15 to 80 feet iuick:. ^b^'prominent* we mean that sulphur has iogged as nnnaM tutiniS some 5 to 20 nercent by volume of uhe entire consuituting : richest ’•show* to date suggests that at Si looS'H in on. of oor .. on -pnot horizon which might average some 70% soluble +. or\af fflui-nhur^ and some 10 ^ shale and bitumen. ?i^ nf a th^lhSls' in other wells are of a smaller nature - All oi the snows riph These other wells average thinner, ^^3003 in which sulphur has been noted as ■prominent' goes do™ to ,s low as five percent. r.f Vif K^rU^tS S”Se miJh luck in correlating sulphur shows between sells.

Will you please report investigated for our to have ths Tbe monthly returns of exports to Saudi Arabia from Koweit and Bahrein are proving most useful to us, while Wanchoo’s weekly 'Persian Gulf War Trade Summaries' are a constant joy to us. At the same time we still feel lamentably ignorant about trade in the Persian Gulf and particularly about the peculiar habits of dhows. It has been suggested for instance that the imposition of import licences for goods carried by dhow to Persia or Iraq would merely mean that the dhows would stop carrying goods to these territories Our difficulty in understanding this thesis is that we cannot see where else the dhows can trade, as throughout your own kingdom we understand you now have quite a rigid export control and we irnagii® that merchant dhow owners would soon tire # of carrying poods the comparatively restricted markets of ^aiire**^ Dub el, oiiirjah, muscat and so on with little chance of ever landing goods in either Persia or Iraq except through Linga and Bunder Abbas. We should greatly appreciate an opinion from you on this very tangled question. ■ . ' mV Secret. D.O.Hg^Q/928 Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Canip, Bahrain.

The second and third paragraphs cf your letter, with deal with different matters will be answered separately. 2. The only sulphur deposits in the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms believed to have possibilities of commercial exploitation are those in Kuwait, for which the Shaikh granted an exclusive concession to the Sastern Gulf Oil Company, Ltd., on 20th ITovember 1941. The Company has, however, not yet commenced f |$operations* Its capital is American, but it is registered in Great Britain with offices at 3, London wall Buildings, London S.C.2. A copy of a letter io.D.0./l3, dated the 3rd February, 1941, from the General Manager, Kuwait Oil Company, to the Political Agent, Kuwait, and of its enclosure, giving some information regarding the nature of the sulphur deposits is enclosed. Mr. Sass, the writer of the report, was a geologist in the Kuwait Oil company. 3 , On the Persian aide sulphur mines have been profitably worked in the past, i.e. more than thirty years ago, at Khamir and Bustaneh near Lingeh. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company will probably be able to furnish data regarding sulphur deposits at '4ishm and other areas in South Persia where they have carried out geological exploration. 0 ic Major M.J.Smith, Middle Bast Supply Centre, General Headquarters, Middle Bast, Cairo.

Bhoadas of the ^ ^ J lilted at the tgency on j the 19th of June, 1943. / /A Preliminary , Mr * -^oadea accompanied hy Mr. I.D. Scott, -%o., the General Superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company limited arrived from Abadan in an Anglo-lranian Oil Company aircraft on the 16th of June. They paid a courtesy call on His Highness on the same day and later called at the Agency. No business was discussed with His Highness or with the Political Agent. ir. dioales stated that he had come to ^await for two purposes Aich /ere (a) to approach the Chaikh with regard to acquiring his rights in the Neutral :ione, and (b) to prepare for certain preliminary operations in connection with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company limited'a Sulphur Concession. ifith regard to the Neutral lone 'fr. Bhoades expressed surprise that the Shaikh had obtained such early information of the purpose of his visit. He ^ould undoubtedly have been interested to Isam the source of His Highness* information but care ms taken not to satisfy his not unnatural curiosity. 2. ?£r. dhoades stated that he had been informed of the Shaikh*s attitude by the India Office when he was in London, but that the instructions he had received from his principals were clear and he had no option but to make an approach to His Highness. vi I informed T/r, Bhoades that His Highness had made it plain to me that he was not prepared to discuss this question with him or with any other individual at the present time. Mr. Bhoades said he guite realised the position but he must carry out his instructions. If however the -halien informed him that he would not discuss the matter then there would be no more to be said for the time being. He does not propose to raise the question with His Highness for three or four weeks. 3. Mr. Bhoades indicated that his Company (the Eastern Gulf Oil Oqnrpany limited) had had preliminary discussions with the California irabia Standard Oil Company, who have already acquiredXto Saul’s rights in the Neutral £one, and that there &amp; T as reason to Relieve that in the event of these negotiations with His Highness heing successfully concluded the two companies would he able to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement for the development of the area* 4. Hr* i\hoa&amp;es stated that he would keep Hr, G.H, Jackson (who will act as Political kgent when I am in India) fully informed of the progress of the negotiations and that he proposed to utilise the services of Abdulla Holla Saleh, His Highness* Secretary, as interpreter when he discussed matters with the Shaikh, With regard to the Sulphur Concession Hr, -ihoades 1 stated that it had 'been indicated to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company limited by the appropriate Department of the United States Government that personnel and equipment not required by the Defence Services could be made available for the preliminary investigation which was necessary to determine accurately if the Kuwait sulphur deposits were sufficiently concentrated to make development on a commercial scale practicable. If the result of this investigation was satisfactory then Hr, Bhoades understood that material for the immediate development of the field and the erection of the necessary refinery would be made available from the United Gtates. (He anticipated that within two years production would be possible), Hhoades proposes to examine the equipment remaining here belonging to the Kuwait Oil Company Limited and to draw up lists of further equipment that will have to be sent from America for the preliminary work and he expects that this will take him three or four weeks. He will then return to the United States after visiting the California rabia otsndard Oil Company's installation at Dharan and the Anglo-Tranian Oil Company's at Abadan. 3. the preliminary work will consist of sinking a numberI -3- Q of shafts in close proximity to each other to a depth of 1,500 feet in the neighbourhood of the Tuwait Oil Company’s No* 1 well and examining the resulting cores. %r v. Rhoades thought that the equipment necessary for the operations would arrive from the United States in tine for woric to be commenced in October. He considered that the work would take from four to five months and that some six to ten drillers etc, presumably from the United States, would be employed. 4. 1 understood from Mr. Shoades that the production of sulnhur was very necessary for war purposes especially in ^ part of the world and it was for this reason that the necessary equipment would be made availaole. 5. Mr. ahoades proposed to inform the Ih&amp;iich of his intention tomorrow and assured me that he would keep Mr. Jackson who was present throughout the interview in touch with all developments. 1 'k\86/13 &amp; 86/28* Telegram From To Ho+479* Dated 5th 8* Political Agent* Kuwait* Political Resident* at Bahrain* received 7th July 194 3* Khwait telegram Ro*422 June 18th. 2* Rhoades has made his approach to Shaikh regarding the neutral Zone.

P.R . The points on which India Office seek your views are (a) Should we encourage the granting of a concession to the K.O.C* or the American interests therein. (b) Should any conditions e.g. as to disposal of products, be imposed. (c) Should the Shaikh be informed that H.M.G.expect him to seek their adtice and approval before granting a concession. U) Should a pre-emption agreement between H.M.G. and the Company be negotiated. Comment . (a) it appears from JP.A. f s telegram that the concession is being sought only by the American interests in the K.O.C. While, for the reasons given in the latter half of para.4 of PUC it is desirable to encourage the grant of a concession, /itit would seem desirable to ensure some British participation and that the Company formed shall British,i*e.registered in the British Empire even if its capital^is American* (b) The above partly answers (a)* As regards conditions relating to disposal of products thi I is a matter which depends on varying market conditions and the Company would be very reluctant to bind itself. The simplest solution would appear to be a pre-emption agreement, which would act as a check on the Company’s marketing activities* (c) This would appear desirable. (d) The negotiation of a pre-emption agreement would appear preferable to the imposition of conditions regarding marketing. 21.2.4C. be tfazLy ( ; £&gt;-} /Li r - u (Z~CU nycUy* cf',- ^4U^U h/. ho £- *7 o( . 13 -s • 5 ' p/t' A typA* &lt; - Ujrtu ^ — ^ sgives it every encouragement and the Company has presumably realised by now that both H.M.G. and the Shaikh are anxious that there should be early exploitation.* ’ &lt;/ith regard to the instructions that the Company should be pressed to reduce the period of the tv/o years' e option please see the last sentence of P.R.*s comments on Article i at p.65.

The India Office suggested something in th&lt;| neighbourhood of Sh.2/6). 2. Dril ling. Art.2(a) of the second schedule. H.' .G. suggested drilling 4,000 feet in one year (p.8l). The Company undertook to drill 4,000 feet before the third anniversary (p.85). H.M.G.agreed to these modified conditions (p.87)• 3. “Article 6a to (a) H . This appears to be an error and should presumably read “Article 6a.(a)“.

Re.(a): This is as P.A.says local politics. We are not concerned. Re: (b). (i). Local labour . The first paragraph of Art.SB deals with the employment of labour under the supervision of the Company’s skilled employees and lays down that the Company “shall be the sole judge of the fitness and, capability of workmen it may wish to employ”. The representa tive of the Shaikh shall, however, “have the right to check from time to time the rolls of employees recruited in the State of Kuwait to ensure that each person is a Kuwait sub ject and of good reputation”.

The second sentence of the second sub-para, of Art.SB says The Company shall have the right to import skilled and technical employees*. The skilled and technical employees of the Company will therefore be the only foreigners, with whom we are concerned. If, therefore, it is made clear to the Shaikh that his representative’s pov/ers as regards labour are as laid down in the first para, of this article, and do not include '’foreigners* as defined in the Kuwait Order in Council, no objection need be taken.

Control of local market rates is clearly a matter for the local officials. 6.
