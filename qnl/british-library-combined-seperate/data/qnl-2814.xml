Each report reflects the expertise and mission of the Division, with sections (not all present in every report) on public health, labour, agriculture, forestry and soil conservation, animal husbandry, entomology (mostly anti-locust operations), and statistics. Each report opens with a general note on recent activities.The following reports are present within the file:on the inception of the Division and the work of October 1946 (folios 8-12);November-December 1946 (folios 25-30);first quarter of 1947 (folios 32-35);second quarter of 1947 (folios 37-45);third quarter of 1947 (folios 47-57);third quarter of 1948 (folios 62-68).The file also contains, as enclosures, the directive on the functions of the British Middle East Office (folios 59-61) and a transcript from a parliamentary question on the same subject (folio 70).On folio 71 are internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00015e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
