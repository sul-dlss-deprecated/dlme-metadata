The main issues covered are: refugees, the fate of the rebel leaders, and negotiations over a settlement.In addition to India Office correspondence and memoranda, the volume includes correspondence from: the High Commissioner for Iraq; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Vincent Biscoe); the Colonial Office; the Foreign Office; HM Chargé d’Affaires, Jeddah; and Ibn Saud.The papers include: intelligence reports concerning the movements of rebel tribes and the activities of their leaders; the role of the Royal Air Force (aeroplanes and armoured cars) in reconnaissance and defence; the policy on the Awazim tribe, who had been allowed to enter Kuwait; the policy on refugees from the rebel tribes who attempted to enter Iraq, Kuwait, and Transjordan; the return of property stolen by the rebels; measures to prevent rebels crossing into Iraq and Transjordan; discussion of the policy on the rebels' women and children; the activities of Faisal al Dawish [Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh], including his unconditional surrender in January 1930; the British Government's policy on the bombing of rebel refugees, the objective of which was said to be to intimidate, rather than cause casualties (folio 326); the activities of the Hejazi Government official Hafiz Wahba; the question of whether to hand over rebel leaders to Ibn Saud; Colonial Office instructions to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning his negotiations with Ibn Saud (folios 247-258); the progress of Biscoe's negotiations; Ibn Saud's attitude to rebel leaders (e.g. folio 79); proposals for a meeting between King Faisal [Fayṣal I] of Iraq, and Ibn Saud; a petition from persons claiming to represent various Hejazi political parties in Egypt, expressing opposition to the Hejaz Government (folios 65-66); letters from Fayṣal bin Sulṭān al-Dawīsh to Ibn Saud (folios 46-48); and the successful outcome of Biscoe's negotiations with Ibn Saud.The volume also contains a minute dated 1934 concerning a rumour that two of the rebel chiefs had been executed on the orders of Ibn Saud (folio 3).The file includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained by year.
