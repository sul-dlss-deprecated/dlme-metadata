These remarks were repeated to Campbell by Izzat Jaffer and Campbell discussed them with me. Apparent ly he had previously suggested to Jordan that the Sheilch should be invited to see the township and Jetty and Jordan had not adopted the suggestion. 2. Capmbell and I agreed that he ( Campbell ) should mention it to Jordan again and that, if he did nothing about it, I should mention it to him officially. Yours ever, H.S. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIB.,CSI., Political Resident Persian Gulf Bahrain.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000122_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/271</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000122</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/271</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File C 5/19 General Manager KOC (Mr. L.
