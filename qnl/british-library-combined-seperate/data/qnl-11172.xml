The report provides details of the precise location of the area, and the mining rights which the Syndicate wishes to secure.The report goes on to refer to a counter-draft to the Syndicate's own draft proposal, which has been put forward by the Persian Government, and which makes various demands including certain exceptions to the Syndicate's mining rights, Persian control over building plans, and restrictions to each working area.The report also discusses an intervention, made by the Russian Government in June 1913, on behalf of the Société d'Etude (the international syndicate which was created to examine the Trans-Persian railway project), which suggested that there be an equal division of interest in the concession, a far as the neutral zone was concerned.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Railways Syndicate</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kerman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000165#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
