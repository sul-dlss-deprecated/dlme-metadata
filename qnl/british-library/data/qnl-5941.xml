At the time stated a Persian warship came to us, and the officers ordered us to lower our jolly boat and go to them. Ee accordingly did this, but when we approached their ship, we found fully ar'ied seamen with rifles posted on the gangway. Some of the jolly boats crew tried to climb up the ships side by means of the gangway but the armed men pushed them down. The sun was very hot owing to the dead calm and the fact that it was mid-day. The crews only idea was to take rest and shelter from the sun on board the varship. The officers next ordered the 'Nakhuda* to come up alone.I,the Bekhuda at once boarded ths ship, upon which they sent four persons to our Chow to inspect and examine her. They were taken there in our jolly ooat and I was left on the ship alone. As our jolly boat left the ships side for the Dhow, they loaded and trained a gun on my ship. After the above persons had made a thorough inspection of our boat, they came back to the v &gt; rship. I then asked them to note on the manifest that my ship had been examined, so that it would no in any other warship, but they refused to do so. After muchmuch asking they wrote as desired. -astly we returned to our ship and raised anchor. The above I submit for ]jfour Sxcellenoy’s information. USUAL Ending.

From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Diokson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ; u s h 1 r e . Seizure of Kuwait Dhow by Persian Warship ' iff Hen jam ^ Sir With reference to your No.732-S, dated the 27th June 1933, I have the honour to # inform you that I was lucky enough to get hold of the master of the Kuwait n Indianman n this morning. He had been away in Basrah for some time, and had just returned. 2 . I was not only able to get the information you required about the dhows position etc., when she was first held up, but I was also able to ascertain the depth of the water, when she was finally forced to anchor, which from our point of view is ver as satisfactory as it might have been, but I had to rely entirely on the Sheikhs reports, which being in the nature of second hand evidence missed the point in some respects. 4. I found the master of the rt Fath ul Khair rt , Salim bin Mubarak, a sensible and quiet sailorman of about 45 years of age. He not only produced his ships charjl, which was quite up io date but also showed that he thoroughly 3. I regret that understood itr\ - 2 - 5 # Tlie evidence lie gave me, relative to the incident w&amp;s as follows (a) He entered the Persian Gulf, test of the Quoin Li^ht (Balanah we Banatiha) and made direct for Fenjam harbour in order to repair his large sail which had been torn in half during the stormy weather he had encountered outside the &lt;’ulf# ^6 was using a small 'storm' sail. (b) A strong Bhamal was blowing as he approached Henjam Island. (c) When about 8 miles from Henjam and 10 from Qjsm Island, he sighted the iersian Warship 'Babr? Bhe was moving in an easterly direction, ^he was then due South of Hen jam Island and some way of it. (d) When the 'Babr' saw him she altered course and came up with his ship, when he was at a point just south of the 'J n in the word HENJAM (See Admiralty Chart, Persian Gulf, Eastern Section)* -- heavy sea was running. (e) The captain of the Babr then hailed him ordered him to heave to and send a boat. This quite impossible in the sea that was running, and with wind and tide against him, he (the master oi the dhow) replied that the operation was not feasible and begged to be allowed to anchor when he got under the lea of Henjam, where the water was shallow. (f) This answer appeared to enrage the Persian Commander, who repeatedly ordered him to stop ana anchor else he would ram him. (g) All this time the Dhow was making progress and as soon as she reached a point just north of the 'H' of Henjam, and it was found by sounding3 sounding^ thfct there were 17 I’fithons of we ter, t&gt;e meyarfer anclored. iven here he (the laster) would not have considered it safe to carry out the opera tion, but was forced to do so by the abr cutting in close ahead of him and forcing him to lower his sail for fear of a collision. (h) The M Babr’ T then came alongside in spite of his (the dhow master’s)protests and clumsily crashed into the bow o’ his ship, doing some is.400/- damage. This was an entirely uncalled for operation as any sailor could have told that to attempt to ccme along side was courting disaster with the sea that was running. L | 6 .

In reply to (Sir R.Hoars 9 s) esteemed note No. 260 (Of May 19th 1965 • Ordiheheaht 29th 1312) regarding the captuz'e of the ship 'Fath-ul-Khair* of Kuwait while she was sailing near Henjam. I hare the honour to state that enquiries have 'been made in the matter from the concerned quarters. Now the Ministry of War. on the report they have received from the competent authorities, state that the ship of the Imperial Government, in the month of Esfand of the last year (February-Mareh 1933) met with a suspected ship in the neighbourhood of Henjam island. Owing to the inclemency of the weather any inspection of cargo in the sea was impossible and the boat in question was taken to Bandar Abbas with a view to investigating the documents and examining the cargo of same and the matter was referred to the Head of the local Customs. When It was proved, on investigation, that the ship was not carrying smuggled goods, she was relsased. In vlsw of the fact that most of the ships carrying smuggled goods with s view to avoiding any pursuit or capture prepare forged (false) way-bills and licenses which they produee to the ships on investigation, if necessary precautions and examination are not made in such cases, it would be impossible, in principle, to prevent contraband traffic and to prosecute smugglers.

From what he told me it seems quite clear that the Nakhoda’s position at the time his ship was boarded was exactly as stated originally in my despatch No.116 of the 4th June to you, namely 10 miles North West by West of the old Portuguese Fort, and well out to sea, in other words he was Just about 10 miles away and TrafrfrxTBMjtKligTwni almost due west of that prominent feature. 4 # The Nakhoda’s position as given by me there- fore does not differ much from what he the Nakhoda actually stated in his original written statement to the Shaikh. In this statement he gave his position as T, ten miles to the north west of old Bus hire and in a North Westerly direction from Has Halaila'. 5 . For the benefit of the uninitiated old Bushire is the name given to the old ruined town which liesI lies on the coast to the south of the Residency and some % miles west of the Tillage of Hillailah, and between that place and Reshire. t * 10 light of this knowledge, therefore, the Nakhoda’s statement fits in with the Shaikh’s report to me and my report to you although in his latest interview with me he the Nakhoda is now inclined to make his posi tion 15 miles North West by West of Old Bushiro. He certainly maintains that he was fully 10 miles from the nearest shore. • • Clearly in the ,f Hote on the position of the Kuwait i dhow ; sent asan enclosure to Tehran’s despatch o.95 of the 15th July to Bushire the writer is unaware of the true position of Old Bushire .and believes the old Portuguese Port to be north of Reshire, when in reality it is south of that point. He has quite excusably there- lore been somewhat mystified by the four separate reports on the position of the dhow when held up. kaster of the rath al Khair, and as a result of the cross- questioning that I put him through, I can say with confi dence that the position of the dhow when boarded by the Persians was just about 10 miles due West of Reshire landing stage, and so was well outside Persian territorial waters.

The sum of four hundred rupees was stated In my second note to be due in respect of the first oollialont no sum was mentioned In respast of the second collision. 3. The use of the term •‘near Heajam* conveniently ignores the fact that the uhow was four mile a from the eoaat when first hailed by the 'Babr”.

It was too dark to notice if she was carrying a flag, but presumably not, it being night. The Iranian boat was not showing limits. They used a torch on coming alongside. The Kuwaiti boat was showing her lights. One of those on board, a member of the crew of the Iranian boat spoke with the accent of Basra in Iraq, the others spoke Persian. It was very dark (the 23rd of the lunar month of Safax) and it was not noticed if those on board the Iranian boat were in uniform or not. No member of the Iranian boat came aboard nor did they see the wounded men. The three wounded men are SA*AD al Omani now attending American Hospital in Kuwait for his wound in thigh and shoulder. aLI Mehri whose wound has healed. It was a graze on his forehead. MU3A ibn^jLiy a who had a elicit wound in the chest which has healed. The Kuwaiti dhow after leaving Yas Island sailed for Kuwait direct, the long time tak - 27 days - being due to contrary (North) winds. They arrived in Kuwait on the 13th June and reported the matter on the 15th (after unloading on Hie 14th). The Ruler sent them to me on the 17th June. I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Captain, Politi cal Agent, KuwaitTranslation of a letter No.R-5/112, dated the 27th Rabi’Auwal 1355, corresponding to the 17th June 1936, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. ^ After compliments, Regarding the Kuwaiti dhow whose case with the Iranian Govermient 1 s launch I have reported to you verbally- The dhow is of the 'Bum' type, named 'auhail', numbered 273 and owned by Kuhaimnad ath-Thunaiyan. Her nakhuda is named Ibrahim bin Shayi*, and she was coming from Zanzibar with a cargo of wood trunks for Kuwait. The wind was moderate Bhamal (North), and the dhow was tacking under one sail opposite to Has Biwan near ling a. *hen they thought they were near enough to land, they turned into a seaward angle, and just as the dhow took her course the launch appeared to them at a distance. Thinking it was a small fishing boat, the nakhuda ordered the steerer to turn a little to the starboard for fear of the dhow colliding vdth it. But as they dame nearer to it, a running fire was opened at them without warning. Then they knew that it was the Iranian Government’s launch. Therefore, the nakhuda at once ordered the sail to be brought dam. During the process, however, fire increased, and the man on the sails was shot. He let go the rope saying that he was wounded, and the sail descended in disorder, for the other crew hid themselves on account of heavy firing. The rope in its rushing flow pushed with it a piece of coir matting which was entangled in the big pulley fixed to the deck. The sail stopped at half-mast. All the while firing was going and two other crew got slight grazings: one on the forehead and the other on the chest, as for the first crew wounded, the bullet hit him on the thigh, pierced it, grazed his shoulder and passed on to the mast and stuck there. After great effort, however, the crew were able to release the sail rigging. The sail fell into the sea, because owiag to the heavy firing the crew dared not show themselves to colie ct it• The timeTli© time, when this occurred, was about 2 o'clock at night (Arabic time - 9.00 p.m.) on the w 23rd Safar 1355, corresponding to the 14th May 1936. uhen the sail had fallen into sea and the launch came close to the dhow, the nakhuda shouted to them and said, n What is the reason for all this heavy firing at a my dhow which is travelling on a safe sea? (-translators Note i.e. a sea where peace reigns or should do so) You have wounded three of my crew, one seriously'. The launch personnel replied, 'Why did you not bring down the sail?' The Nakhuda, 'You did not speak to us or make any signal neither about bringing the sail down nor about anything else, but directly opened fire at us without warning. Do you think that is right?' The launh personnel, 'You must now proceed to Linga'. The Nakhuda, 'All right, give us a cable'. The launch personnel, 'You set your sail on, and we will follow on with you'. This discourse took place while the launch was alongside the dhow. Then the launch personnel asked to see the 'declaration' (of nationality^ and the manifest. When the nakhuda wanted to hand these over to them, they threw a cable and touched the dhow. At this moment they lit an electric torch and looked at the dhow's stem. Seeing the dhow’s number, they said, 'Let go our cable, so as not to collide against the dhow'. This having been done, they asked, 'To what country do you belong, and ahee whose property is your dhow?' The Nakhuda replied, 'We belong to Kuwait, and our dhow is the property of Muhammad and Thunaiyan al Ghanim'. The launch personnel, 'You are permitted to go'. The nakhuda, '*hy you do such with us? You have wounded three of my crew for nothing, and at last you say we are permitted to go'. But the launch left them and went away. This is what exactly has befallen the dhow from the abovementioned launch. I have ordered the nakhuda, one of his steerers and the foreman to report at your office, as you might likelike to make furtbsr enquiries from them about the case. I consider the question to be an important one, for such an aggression of the Iranian launch in a safe sea is a matter 'which bodes ill. On her way the dhow called at W,ais island where th nakhuda made enquiries about the launch, but could not discover its name and number. Someone, however, told him that the captain of the launch was one from Bush ire named Mahmud . I beg you kindly to submit the case to the responsible authorities with a view to the maintenance, as it ought to be, of peace and security in the Gulf. Usual ending,I ft . CONFIDENTIAL.

Sir, ^ith reference to your letter ao.]?.3169/1359/91 of tne 7tn July, I am commanded by My lords Commissioners of tne Admiralty to state, for tne information of Viscount iialifax, tnat Tneir Lordships have nad under consideration tne memorandum dealing witn interference by Persian parsnips with Arab dnowa which was enclosed in -^.Seymour’s despatch No. 147 of the 2lst April last, together with the comments of the Political Resident on this memorandum whdch were contained in a semi-official letter to Hr Aubrey -ietcalfe dated 2lst May. 2. The main point raised in .'ir. Jeymour * s memorandum is wnetner or not force should in tne last resort be employed by on e of H.54.Ships to protect an Arab dncw against molestation by a f-ersian warship. They note that Ar.Seymour suggests that, al though force might properly be used in Arab territorial waters, it should not at present be authorised in cases occurr ing on the high seas. 3. Their Lordships suggest that tne necessity for the employ ment of force against a Persian warship in such an eventuality is very unlikely to arise. On the one occasion wnen a few years ago a British sloop came on tne scene wnen a Persian warship was interfering with an Arab dnow, tne Persian ship made off in great haste long before H.M.Ship came up with the dhow. 4. «y Lords nevertnedeos consider it to Be important tnat d. f.3nips snould nave clear autnority to use force if necessary, The Under Secretary of .'State, / Foreign Office, 3.T.I. / / , on /on the high seas aa well aa in Arab ten*itorial waters, they suggest, therefore, that the instructions should take the form that, in the event of an Arab dnow being interfered with in the presence of a British warship, the latter should contnunicate with the Persian warship, warn her that ane is committing an illegal act and, if necessary, taxe the dnow in tow and take such other steps as are necessary to ensure that she is not further interfered with. They would point out that unless the instructions are in the sense suggested above, tnere is always the possibility, however remote, that a Persian war veosel might persist in her interference in the presence of and in spite of remonstrances by a British warship. If in such circxostances no attempt were made to resist the illegal action of tne Persian warship the effect upon our prestige amongst the Arabs would be likely t o be serious. t&gt;. An additional reason for issuing instructions in tne sense proposed above is that (in spite of recent verbal communications by individual Persian officials) it seems likely that it will shortly be necessary to make a formal communication to tne rersian Government in the sense proposed in paragraph 6 of Mr. Seymour’s memorandum - namely tnat orders naze been given to H*H. mips to prevent any interference with Arab dnows on tne high seas. In this connection, ineir herds concur with the views expressed in paragraphs 4 and S of tne Political Resident's semi-official letter of tne 21at May. Any divergence between the language used at Tehran and tne instructions issued to M.a. Ships would clearly be open to objection. 6. Another suggestion contained in Mr.Seymour*s memorandum is that in waters claimed by Persia as territorial, but not admitted as such by His Jtojesty's Government, the same course should /should be adopted ag in Persian territorial waters proper - nataely that there should be no intervention by Hig Majesty’s .Ships, but that diplomatic protests should be mode and claims advanced if the vessels nave been arrested without reasonable cause* The reason he advances for making t is suggestion ig the desirability of avoiding risking a reference to an internat ional tribunal on the question of the limit of Persian teri- t or ial waters* 7. n heir Lordsnipa feel that arrangements on the lines proposed are unnecessarily complicated, and that the risk of an incident leading to recourse to an international tribunal on the question of the proper extent of territorial waters can be discounted. ^hey therefore suggest that the same instructions should cover the whole of the nigh seas, up to the limit admitted by us as Persian territorial water. 8* 4s regards possible interferences inside Arab territorial waters, Their Lordships would draw attention to the Muscat, ■Rahrain and Kuwait Proclamations made in 1898-1900 in connection with the arms traffic* 'lopies of these proclamations are appended for convenient reference* It will be seen that they all confer upon Persian vessels the right of search of Muacati, Bahraini and Kuwaiti dno.vs within the ruler’s own territorial waters. The question of the cancellation of these proclamations has recently been under consideration - see in this connection semi-official correspondence commencing witn Mr.Clauson’s letter P.Z. 2970 of the 11th *ay and foreign Office despatch jNo.204 to Tehran. Their Lordships consider that it is extremely unlikely that the Persian Oovtsrnment are aware of these provisions, and they feel tnat it is not necessary to take o^en steps to cancel them - wnicn, as pointed out in the corres pondence /-4- correspondence referred to above, might draw attention to tne Persian T? inafin of 1897. They .vould point out moreover tnat these proclamations only relate to the suppression of the arms trade, whereas the present activities of tne foreign warships seem to be mainly directed to the suppression of amuj ling. 9. In order to cover the point, rneir Lordonipo suggest that the instructions to Ji.n. mips should provide that if a Persian warship which is interfering with an \rafc dhow attempts to Justify her action to a British warship by alleging tn-t tne vessel is engaged in the arms traffic, tne Tfritign lormanding Officer should reply tnat, if tne allegation proves to be correct, ne will see tnat the offenders are properly dealt with according to the law to -which they are subject; and that ne should subsequently take tne necessary steps to ensure tnat tnis is done, acting in collaboration with tne political Resident and nis staff. It is understood that all tne Arab .States in treaty relations with H.s*.Government nave legislation prohibiting thei~ subjects from engaging in tne arms traffic. 10, Their Lordships nave noted tnat in tne political Resident's note dated 26th February suggesting tne cancellation of the proclamations, it is stated in paragraph 2 that under tne n us cat ..Proclamation Persian vessels nave rights of search of this interpretat ion is based upon tne notification dated I3tn notification as formally conveying powers of searon u .on tne unseat vessels on the nign seas. Tneir Lordships presume tnat January,1898, wnicn was apparently issued at the tne proclamation and wnicn states tnat 'in lutur he surae time as Lordships would suggest that it is unn eoessary to tr^at this nign /-b- nii$n ae&amp;8 # and tnat it can be regarded aa being no more tnan an intiTnation to tne lultan'a subject a tnat tney cannot expect tne support of tHeir ruler if tney indulge in forbidden activities, on the assumption, therefore, that no other document exists which confers these powers in a more formal and definite manner, Their Lordships suggest that tne matter would be adequately met if the instruction covering tne case where a Persian warship alleges that a dhow is engaged in tne arms traffic (see paragraph 9 above) were made applicable to any case of interference with an Arab dhow on tne nign seas as well as in Arab territorial wat e^s. 11. In reply to tne enquiry as to tne existing instructions in your letter of tne 7tn July, I am to state that i'neir Lord- snips nave been unable to trace that any specific instructions governing tne use of force nave been issued to ii.a. Snips in connection with Persian interferences witn Arab dhows, other than those issued in Admiralty letter m.01721/31 of trie 14tn October, 1931, (copies of wnicn were sent to foreign Office and India Office on tne same date) wnicn stated tnat H any interference outside Persian territorial waters witn Arab dnows suspected of smuggling would call for a strong protest. Tne action to be tpjcen would, nowever, nave to depend on tne cir cumstances of tne case**. As regards instruction or general application, Article 949 K.R. and A.I. provides tnat ^Titian ships (wnich would undoubtedly be interpreted as including snips under Sritisn protection) 'are only to be protected by force against actual and wrongful violence arid when remonstrance nas failed-.

Persian interference with Arab dhows •E 963/162/91 OTEICTS, 3.W.I. 30th March 1933. Sir, With reference to your letter 03427/37 of the 10th September 1937, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lord Commieioners of the Admiralty, the accompanying copiea of correspondence with His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in the course of which Mr. Seymour makes certain observations regarding the attitude to be adopted by the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s ships in case of Persian interference with Arab dhows. 2. As Their Lordships will see from paragraph 3 of i Mr. Seymours despatch, he considers that any incident involving one of His Majesty’s ships and an Iranian vessel, in waters rhich, although beyond the three mile limit, are claimed by the Iranian Oovernment as territorial, would give rise to great bitterness, and that it is therefore preferable to avoid the risk of any such incident occur ing. 3* Lord Halifax is aware that interference by a Persian ship with an Arab dhow is more likely to take place in waters near the Persian coast and an oral assurance has, moreover, already been given by the Persian Government that Persian warships will not molest Arab vessels in Arab territorial waters or on the high sees. At tne same time, while fully conscious of the ill-feeling which would result if one of His Majesty’s ships were to take measures involving a Persian /ves a el The secretary of the Admiraltyvessel within the six mile limit, His Lordship realises that the effect produced on the Rulers of the Arab coast if one of His Majesty’s ships failed to protect a dhow in waters which, as the Arab Rulers know perfectly well. His Majesty’s Government do not regard as Persian territorial waters, might be equally unfortunate. It is, moreover, probable that Persian susceptibilities would be outraged in whatever waters the incident occurred. 4. Lord Halifax is therefore of the opinion that the balance of advantage lies in including waters outside the but within the six mile limit, three mile limit,/in the scope of the proposed Admiralty instruct ions. o® His Lordship is, however, anxious that, in the issue of these instructions the following points should be omphasis ed: (a) fhat the instructions must be carried out (as he has no doubt Their Lordships intend) with utmost tact and discretion, and force be used only in the very last resort. (b) That in all cases, and not only in arms cases, His Majesty’s ships shall inform the Persian vessel thr.t they are themselves prepared to verify the flag and the papers of the dhow in question, to see, if the circumstances warrant it, that it proceeds to its alleged destination, and, if there is any jprima facie reason to suspect that an offence has been committed, to ensure that the offence is duly investigated and punished.6 . Lord Halifax is,however, moat anxious that every effort should be made, compatible with the proper performance of their duties by His Majesty’s ships, to avoid an incidence in any waters of tne .Persian Gulf, more especially in the present time of unsettled international relations and having regard to the importance of the oil supplies derived from Persian territory. 7. His Lordship therefore urges that the instructions issued to the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s ships should make this point abundantly clear and that the general Admiralty instructions should be accompanied by further (posaibly secret) instructions to the effect that His Majesty's Government are anxious to avoid an incident vithin six miles of the Persian coast even more than elsev/here on the high seas, “' a cna t although the same action iaust, if the necessity inevitably arises, be taken within those limits as in the reEt - tae ’tlf, commanders of ships should, if jossible, contrive to avoid situations arising in which their snips are li.cely to ce upon the scene when a dhow is stopped by a Persian vessel within the six mile limit. The simplest way of avoiding auch situation's not to enter the six mile limit, and it is presumably usually possible for His Majesty’s ships, except m one or two places where the main sea routes may pass near Persian islands, not to do bo at all except when going to ot* from Per si tin ports. ° # c ° t * y QI ~ 11113 better is being sen^/the India Office and to Tehran.

(12 7391/1339/91) Sir, tfith reference to your despatch No.295 (543/2/37) of the Slat July last regarding Persian Interference with Arab dhov/s f I transmit for your information the accompanying copies of correspondence with the Admiralty as t o the attitude t o be adopted in the event of such incidents recarring. The India Office concur in the vieva expressed by the Admiralty. 2. In vie,f of the oral assurancesfeiven to you by the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Persian -warships /i^ve been instructed not to molest s.re b vessels in future either in Arab territorial waters or bn the high seas, I agree that the question of a formal warning to be addressed to the Persian Government may be left in abeyance, to be re considered if a further incidence should occur. This does not, however, affect the main question of the principle arising out of your despatch No. 147 of the 21st April last, namely how far one of His Majesty’s ships ought, in fact, to go in order to protect an Arab dhow from interference. 3. as you will see, the Admiralty consider it important thPt in the Persian Gulf, as elsewhere, His Majesty’s ships should have clear authority to use force if this is necessary in order to prevent interference with any British or British protected vessel, not only as regards Arab territbrirl waters, /but also H.J. Peymour Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O., etc., etc., etc., Tehran.but also as regards the high scpb and waters claimed by Persia as Persian territorial waters, but not admitted as such by His Majesty’s Government; and they suggest the issue of new instructions to this effect, with the addition of certain provisions to cover the possioility that a Persian warship might attempt to justify its action by alleging thi t an Arab dhow was engaged in the arms traffic. 4. Subject to your further observations, I am disposed to consider that the Admiralty view of this problem is the correct one and to comcur in the issue of instructions on the lines which the Admiralty propose, on the following conditions:- (a) Thajk it shall be emplmsised (ae it may be srfely assumed that the Admiralty intend) that the instruct ions must be carried out with the utmost tact and discretions and force used only in the very last res ort • (b) That in all cases, and not only in arras cases, His Majesty’s ships shall inform the Persian vessel that they are tnemselves prepared to verify the flag and the papers of the dhow in question, to see, if the circumstances warrant it, that it proceeds to its alleged destination, and if there is any pnma faci e reason to suspect that an offence has been committed, to ensure that the offence is duly investigated and pun ished. 5. ffith regard to the particular point about the action to be taicen in waters claimed by the Persian Government as territorial waters, but not admitted as such by Hia Majesty’s Government, I am advised that in legal proceedings regarding a /clr im t o1 claim to territorial rights over patera more than three miles from the Persian coast it would in all probability be found that * (1) If His Majesty’s Government were plaintiffs before an international tribunal aoking for judgment to the effect that Persia is not entitled to excereise territorial right in waters more then three miles from the Persian coast. His Majesty’s Government would lose their case. (2) If the Persian Government were plaintiffs asking for judgment to the effect that His ifcijesty’s Govern ment must recognise a Persian claim to the excercise of territorial rights in waters more than three miles from the Persian cofst, the Persian Government would lose their case. The law is in fact uncertain and it is likely th£* t the litigant who had to prove his case would fail. In any proceedings arising out of the action of one of His Majesty’s ships in preventing Persian vessels from operating against Arab vessels in waters lying between three and six miles f]bom the Persian coast, Persia would be the plaintiff and Kie Majesty’s Government could probably regard the outcome of the proceedings with equanimity. 6. The Admiralty and the India Office agree, in :the light of the information contained in the despatch Ho.295 of the 31at July, and especially in view of the fact that the Persian Government seem to be unaware of'the provisions of the Muscat proclamation of 1398, that it would be inadvisable openly to cancel the proclamations of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and iCuwait and the Sultan of Muscat. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sd. lacy Bsggallay.

Sir, I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of trie Admiralty to acquaint you, for trie information of Lord Halifax, that they riave riad under consideration your letter 2 968/16^/91 of trie 30tri Uarori, 1938, concerning trie action to be taicen by Commanding ufficers of H.M. ariips in trie Persian uulf to protect Arab dno^s against interference by Persian snips. 2. My Lords note triat Lord Halifax considers triat the balance of advantage lies in including weters off the Iranian coast outside the triree-mile limit, but within trie six-mile limit, in trie scope of the proposed instructions autnorising Commanding Officers to use force in the last resort to prevent interference on trie high sees. Lord Halifax then suggests, however, that in order to reduce the risk of a serious incident within the six-mile limit, further, possibly secnet, instruct ions should be given to Commanding Officers that tney snould, so far as possible, contrive to avoid witnessing incidents which may occur within the six-mile limit. ^ Lords have given careful consideration to Lord Hal i fax * a suggestion, but regret tnat they are unable to agree that Commanding Officers* discretion should be limi- -ted by such secret instruct ions. They do not consider that it yvould be in fact practicable to instruct H.M. Ships not to enter/enter the alx-mile limit. It would not, for instance, be possible, without serious detriment to our prestige for H.M ships patrolling outside the six-mile limit either to ignore an incident which they may observe within the s ix- -mile limit, or tail to pursue, if necessary, an offending Persian vessel^ up to the limit of waters claimed by us as the high seas. The damage to our prestige would be all the more serious if, as would now be thee ase, it were public knowledge that we had authorised resistance to Persian interference outside Persian territorial waters. It would therefore seem necess&amp;ry, if the risk of incidents is to be avoided in the manner s^gested by Lord Halifax for H.M.Ships to be instructed to keep, not only outside tr.e six mile limit, but at a distance from it sufficient to ensure that they did not witness any incident occurring vithin the six miles, or likely to involve pursuit beyond that limit. My Lords do not, however, consider t hat any such instruction would be desirable in principle or practical; those suggested by Lord Halifax would, not, in fact, avoid the risk of incidents, and would, My Lords consider, merely introduce an undesirable element of doubt in Commanding Officers’ instructions which would make decision in particular cases difficult and embarassing* as explained in Admiralty letter M.03427/37 of the 10th Septemner, 1937, they do not consider that the risk of a serious incident arising is great, and, for the reasons explained above, they would be glad if Lord Halifax could agree to the issue of the instruc- -tions without the proposed reservation. 4 “ ^ Lords haTe als0 considered tde proposal that H.M.Ships should undertake to see that suspected vessels proceed/-3 proceed to their alleged destination, and that offences are investigated and punished. To be effective, this would involve escorting the dhow to its alleged destina- -tion. The actual destination of such dhows would presumably be generally within Persian waters; tne alleged destination might be anywhere, and an undertaking to escort suspected dhows would therefore be unacceptable for operational reasons. As regards the investigation # and punishment of offences, Tht#r Lordhhips consider that the proposal in paragraph 9 of Admiralty letter of 10th September, 1937, would be sufficient to cover cases of suspected arms running. It is ooserved, however, tnat the activities of Persian warships appear at present to be mainly directed towards the suppression of smuggling, and its would not seem possible for ar^ undertaking to be given that offences which are offences against Persian law will be investigated and punished elsewhere.

Irotection against interference by Iranian ships is to be afforded by H.B. Ships in the territorial waters of the Arab States under british protection and on the high seas up to the limit of Iranian territorial waters recognised by His Majesty’s Government. Notwithstanding, therefore, the claim advanced by the Iranian Government to a territorial belt six miles in v/idth protection is to be given up to the three mile limit off the Iranian Coast. 2. If the Commanding Officer of one of H.M.Ships observes an Iranian warship or customs vessel interfering with a protected -arab vessel in the waters described in 1 above, he is to communicate with the Iranian ship and warn her that she is committing an illegal act. 1 : {- 2 - release the Arab vessel, H.M.Ship is to take the latter irj tow, and adopt such measures as may be necessary to ensure that no further interference occurs* 4* if the Iranian ship opposes such action with force the Commanding Officer of H.I f *3hip is authorised to use such force as may be necessary to effect the release of the Arab vessel. 5. if the Iranian 'ship attempts to justify her action by alleging that the Arab vessel is engaged in the arms traffic, the Commanding Officer of h.&amp;.Chip should reply that if the allegation proves correct he will see that the offenders are properly dealt with in accordance with the lav/i to v/hich they are subject; and he is subsequently to take the necessary measures in collaboration with the lolitical Hesident and his staff to ensure that this promise is fulfilled. 6. if an incident occurs within the six mile limit but outside the three mile limit off the Iranian coast, and the Iranian ship justifies its action on the ground that these waters are Iranian territorial waters, the Commanding Officer of H.II.Ship is to reply that H.k. Govern.jent does not recognise such waters as territorial and that he cannot permit interference with Arab shipping outside the three mile limit. 7. The utmost tacfe and discretion are to be employed in dealing with any dispute which may airse, and every endeavour is to be made to obtain the release of the Arab vessel without the use of force, which should be employed only in the very last resort. OommandLing Officers I r _Officers must, however, decide on their own judgement whether a situation has arisen requiring forcible measures. BY aOMI.bUQ 0? TH£IB LORD SHU S Sd.

The sea was rough and we lowered the sails, but owing to the strong wind we were unable to approach her. She then steamed up towards us and struck our dhow delib- rately causing a hole in it, through which water entered into the craft. The Iranian vessel warned us saying that we must approach her, otherwise she would sink our craft. We were obliged .o svim to the Iran ian vessel with the documents belonging to our craft. In spite of going through our documents, they wanted to send some soldiers on board our craft, but they foiled in his due to the strong wind. They then left us to our f’ 3 te in nor boat. We .\ould have been drowned if it had not been for £od*s Mercy. The extent of the damage caused to our craft is estimated at Rs.3,000/-. As this ction is .against the rules obswT^d and respected, we are submitting our complaint to Your Hig ness, requesting you kindly to take such sr stepe that you consider fit for the protection of the sailing craft.from such aggression, so that there may not be a repition of it, and thus the lives of people and their goods will be saved.: .3.

The Kuwaiti vessels were returning to Kuwait from India and all concerned were unanimous that they were well outside territorial waters when stopped. These ocean going craft would in any case have no occasion to approach the Iranian shore except to refill water-tanics or to anchor in case of a storm.

J(Statement of Khalid Hussain Buqambar Master of Country craft 'NIMR n owned by Yusuf Ahmed al Ghanim.) n My craft was called upon to stop by an Iranian Naval vessel at about 5 p.m. on the 11th March, 1947 when at a point 30 miles north-west of Kharg Island. We were out of sight of the Island and of the mainland, which must have been more than 45 miles away. The Naval Vessel was painted grey, with 1 funnel, a gun forward, and machine-guns. The Officers and crew were in uniform and they flew the Iranian flag. We fley the Kuwait flag but were ordered to heave to and send a boat. We hove to but could not send a boat owing to the heavy sea running. The naval vessel then attempted to come along side in spite of the sea and collided with our craft making a hole through which water entered, and causing damage to the extent of Rs 3,000/-. They then threatened to sink our craft unless we sent our papers on board and finally some of our crew swam with the papers to the naval vessel. They endeavoured to send a boarding-party but could not on accourt of the heavy sea and finally left us to our fate in our sinking craft. It was only by strenuous efforts and good fortune that we escaped drowning.' I heard from the crew that the Iranian vessel had left Mohammerah that day and was southward bound. (Statment of Ahmed al Fahad Master of country craft MUTAIRAN'.) At 9 a.m. on the 18th March, 1947 my craft was 18 miles from the nearest point of the Iranian shore opposite Taheriya (South of Has Mataf) and flying the Kuwait flag when an Iranian naval vessel called upon us to he^ve to. She then came a long side very clumsily damaging our rudder, anchor, and fenders in doing so. We were then boarded by an armed party who searched the craft. When they broke open 2 boxes we remonstrated with them but they threatened us with their weapons. They confiscated the following;- 46 dozen reels of cotton thread. , 4 cartons matches (6 dozen in each carton.) 6 bundles head kercheifs (20 in a bundle.) 2 dozen cotton under-vests, and all the tea which we had for consumption on the voyage. They also asked us to hand over our arms and, when we showed them the Permit from the Political Agency, they said we had no right to carry the arms as although India, Yemen, and Africa were mentioned the Persian Gulf was not mentioned. They then towed us for 5 hours towards Lingeh. On the way we met Abdul Wahab At-Tura’s dhow which they stopped and searched and took in tow. They demanded Rs 1,000/- from each craft but we persuaded them to reduce this demand to Rs 50/- whichI * .: . ; ■ - 0 .0 . i . • I ■t whioh Abdul Wahab paid.

(Statement of Abdul Wahab At-Tura Master of country craft 'MUSAAD'. ) 'About 2 p.m. on the 13th March, 1947 I was more than 18 miles from the nearest point of the Iranian shore south of Taheriya when an Iranian Naval Vessel approached from the north towing Ahmed al Fahad’s dhow. They ordered me to heave to although I flew the Kuwait flag, and sent a boarding-party which searched my ' dhow and confiscated 10 pounds of tea, 16 pairs of shoes. They opened the sailor’s chests and took 5 dozen vests, 15 dozen reels of cotton thread, a wheel, and 24 glass chimneys. They demanded Rs 1,000/- from each dhow but were satisfied when I paid them Rs 50/-. The Iranian Naval Vessel was painted grey with a gun forward and machine-guns.

Persian naval interference with Arab dhows.I have the honour to direct the attention of Your Excellency to the increasingly frequent practice of interference by Iranian naval vessels with Koweiti and other Arab dhows, and to refer in particular to two recent cases of such interference which have been brought to the notice of His Majesty*s Government. 2. His Majesty*s Government are informed s (1) that on the 11th March one dhow was stopped at a point 30 miles North West of the island of Kh^arg by an Iranian naval vessel which caused serious damage in coming alongside. It appears that the boarding party failed to board the dhow owing to heavy seas; (2) that on the 18th March two dhows were stopped by an Iranian naval vessel 18 miles from the nearest point of the Iranian shore in the vicinity of Tahiri. Both these dhows were boarded and searched. A few articles were stolen and in each case a sum of Bs 1,000 was demanded, although the dhows were eventually released upon payment of a small levy. I am to point out to Your Excellency that the dhows concerned in these incidents, which were returning to Koweit from India, were flying the flag of Koweit and were stationed well outside Iranian territorial waters when they were intercepted. I am therefore to ask you to be so good as to arrange for the issue of instructions to Iranian naval vessels not to interfere with foreign dhows on the high seas. I am further to emphasize that this practice of stopping koweiti and other Arab dhows on the high seas is likely to lead only to constant friction which it is the earnest desire of His Majesty*s Government to avoid. 4* I shall be grateful to receive Y6ur Excellency*s assurance that adequate measures will be taken by the competent Imperial authority to prevent a recurrence of such interference. 5.

From:- Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (Third Political Department), TEHRAN. To:- No.2875 His Majesty's Ambassador, Tehran. Dated: 24th July, 1947. 1'Ambassadeur, In reply to Your Excellency's letter No.272 dated the 22nd May, 1947, in v/hich several points were raised regarding interference by Persian naval vessels with foreign dhows on the high seas, I have N the honour to offer the following observations:- According to the information which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have received from the competent authorities no Persian naval vessel stopped any dhow in the vicinity of Kharg Island on the 11th March of the current year. It is however reported that on the 21st Isfand (12th March, 1947) the Persian naval ship 'Simurgh' moved out of the Shatt-el-Arab, and about 8 miles outside the Shatt-el-Arab met a Persian motor dhow which was coming from Bushire with a cargo of fruit. As this motor dhow had no rear gear and as the sea was rough she collided with the 'Simurgh' and sustained slight damage. Concerning the second part of Your Excellency's letter I would point out that no description is given of the two dhows which you state were searched in the neighbourhood of Bandari Tahiri. Nevertheless according to the information which I have riceived from the competent authorities the officials of the Customs Department and the port officials warned all dhows which were in the port of Khorramshshr that the Masters of any dhows which . may have been searched on the date of your Excellency's letter should report to the official sent from Headquarters so that their representations and demands may be investigated. Only the crew of dhow No. 372 belonging to Abdul Vahab, son of Abdullah of Kankan who were taking a quantity of charcoal and firewood to Basrah have reported in the manner indicated. The Master of this show, named Isa, son of Jasim (identity card No. 2046 issued at Kankan) has stated that no harm was done to them and that money was paid for the goods purchased from the crev/ w r hich were on the dhow's cargo list and v/hich were purchased by some of the crew? of the Persian naval vessel and some customs officials, by agreement on both sides. For these purchases a sum of 2,280 Rials was paid and a receipt obtained. In making these facts known I request Your Excellency to give me the number and other particulars of any other dhow' which may have been involved in the incidents referred to in your letter so that further enquiries may be undertaken and a settle ment arranged. At the same time I should be glad if Your Excellency would cause instructions to be given that the dhows in question should also refer direct to the Persian Naval Headquarters at Khorramshahr so that their complaints may be investigated and the necessary action taken. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. Sgd/- Muhammed All Humayunjah s■ Translation of letter &gt; T o.

I am very appreciative of the Senior Naval Officer’s help and his obtaining the return of the arms. I should much like to agree to the sugges tion outlined in his telegram 221304Z to simplify Prooe u r*e, but feel that there are abjections. towards Kuwait and the former’s denial of the Sheiicn’s authority and our treaty rights might le.d to most undesirable complications if Kuwaitis gave evidence against Persian arwy officers; parti cularly if this were done in a Persian Military Court and unofficially.

With reference to despatch No. 36 of the 27th January from His Majesty^ Ambassador, Tehran, on the subject of interference by Persian naval vessels with Arab dhows, while I have no reason at present to doubt Admiral Zelli's sincerity, I regret that I still feel sceptical regarding the proposals under consideration for the reasons stated in my despatch No. 4 of the 13th January. 1 asked Colonel Galloway for his comments on the telegram from the Senior Naval Ifficer, Persian Gulf, enclosed with the Tehran despatch under reference and he has replied as follows:* tt The delicate nature of the Persian attitude towards Kuwait and the former’s denial of the Shaikh’s authority and our treaty rights might lead to most undesirable complications if Kuwaitis gave evidence against Persian army officers; parti cularly if this were done in a Persian Military Court and unofficially. Indeed, the fact that Kuwaitis were sent to Khorramshahr to obtain redress direct from a Persian Military Court might be used as an extremely undesirable precedent for the summoning of Kuwaitis to Persia. There is no guarantee that they would be permitted to return particularly as they cannot travel on regular pass ports”. / 2. I would suggest however that the proposals might be put into effect experimentally if a suitable case of inter ference offers itself, i.e. one in which there appears no reasonable doubt that the Persian authorities are at fault, and if the master of the arab dhow concerned is willing to go to Khorramshahr, which I consider unlikely (c.f. paragraph 2 of my despatch No.4), I should have no objection to a Political Agent in the Gulf corresponding direct with His Majesty’s Consul-General, *thwa£, about such a case once I had satisfied myself that it was suitable for treatment on the lines proposed. 3. I should ada that I very much appreciate the value to us of Captain Porter’s personal friendly relations with the Persian naval authorities and am very grateful to him for his success in recovering for us the three Kuwaiti rifles. 4.

No.99(0.160/15/49) BRITISH EMBASSY, TEHRAN. 16th March, 1949. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following comments on^correspondence resting with your ;espatch No.53 (E1561/ 1023/91) of the 5th March about the settlement of complaints rade by British protected dhows against the Persian autho rities. 2. It appears to me that the choice of methods and channels in this matter must depend on the objects which His Majesty’s Government have in view. If it is intended to secure redress for the owners of dhows whose property has been confiscated, or who have been otherwise maltreated, I am still of the opinion that this is more likely to be achieved by representations from His Majesty’s Consul-General or the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf to Admiral Zelli. If, on the other hand, as suggested by the Political Resident in paragraph 2 of his despatch No.4(31/6/49) of the 13th January, the main object is to convince the Persian authorities that we attach impor tance to the rights of dhow owners, representations should be made in Tehran. It is, however, unlikely that such repre sentations will secure redress for the complainants unless they are followed by up in Khorramshahr and substantiated by the oral testimony of the complainants themselves. 3. In view of the difficulties to which both you and Sir R. Hay have drawn attention, I agree that representations should only be made in cases in which the Political Resident considers this procedure appropriate and so long as masters of dhows are not required to appear at Khorramshahr against their will. 4. Subject to your instructions I propose to answer the Persian note, of which a translation was enclosed with my despatch No.408 of the 20th December last, to the effect’ that while there is no objection to masters who have business in Khorramshahr explaining their grievances to the Persian Naval authorities, His Majesty's Government cannot agree that this is a nece sary preliminary to the action called for in my note to the Under-Secretary of State dated the 28th October, last, of which I had the honour to send you a copy in my despatch No.350. 5. Owners of dhows might, I suggest, be told that if they have occasion to make complaints, they may - if they are in Khorramshahr or Basra - lay them before His Majesty's Consul- General, Ahwaz, who will then, if he sees fit, approach the Persian Naval authorities direct. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, and to His Majesty's Consul-rGeneral at Ahwaz. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sgd.) J.H. LE ROUGETEI. The Rt. Hon. Ernest Bevin, M.P. t tc., utc., ETc., Forei gn QiX ice, London.30PY (256/5/49) '1 QN?I J3NTIAL. British Embassy, Tehran. 10 th I'ay, 1949. Dear Department, There are two questions about Bahrain and Oulf Sheikh doms generally on which we should be grateful for guidance. Either through lack of continuity or because we have packed up a number^of files, we have been unable to find adequate precedents in our archives. . first concerns the protection of subjects of gulf Sheikhdoms vis-a-vis the Persian authorities while in Persia. r e -,t 0lltlcal ^£ enc y ati Kuwait recently asked the Consulate at rJiora-amshahr, at the request of the Sheikh of Kuwait to assist some of His Highness’s subjects who owned land in Khuzistan and who were being subjected to vexatious demands a official. In the last few days a representative oi the Kuwaitis in question has called at the Embassy and in reply to his requests for help, we have put him in touch with a suitable official at the I inistry of Justice, without specifying the nature of his business or actually arranging cn interview. ^s the Persian Covernment presumablv regard al' subjects of the Culf Sheikhdoms - and a 'ortiori those in j ersia ^- as iersian nationals, to take any official action on their behalf would, we think, be to court a rebuff and might possibly do more harm than good to the aggrieved partis The second question concerns the formalities to be observed^ oy .rersian nationals entering the territory of the ruli sheikhdoms. ^ A Persian official on anti-locust work recently arrived in Dubai from Bandar Abbas to establish contact with a Pakistani anti-locust party and asked whether tne^political Officer. Trucial Coast had any objection to his visiting on of the locust breeding areas. The Political Officer saw no objection but requested the Persian official to call at the Agency. On finding that his only travel document was one valid lor travel ’’from one port in Iran to another” he Iolitical Officer informed him that in view of his ’ ork* he wo ild be allowed to remain but that he must report a-ain before departure and that for any future visits he should have valid documents. The Persian Gulf Residency have asked us to take the matter up with the appropriate Ministry. Presumably no contravention of the immigration regulations of t j.x6 Sheikhdoms should be allowed to pass unchallenged particularly where acquiescence might imply derogation of the rights of ms Majesty's Government and of the Hulers. It may however, be necessary for the exact form of action to vary according to the circumstances. Thus traveller of no import ance might be deported; the master of the craft in which he traveiled might be.imprisoned or fined; while, as in the case of the .^ersian official referred to above, the offence mi.vht go unpunished provided that the offender was made to realise the nature of his offence. It seems to us an open question whet/her ofiicial action should be taken in Tehran after each offence. ^ In the present circumstances we see no reason why this should not be done. It is, however, highly improbable tuat such action would ever result in the Persians conforming to oar requirements since to do so woaid very seriously weaken their claims to the territories in question. The/ Eastern Department, foreign Office, London, SAY. 1.The principle involved in this question is likely to come up in a concrete form before long in the following way. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have arranged with Hunting Air Surveys Limited to carry out an aerial survey of the Dashtak-Sameh region of the Persian coast next winter, which will involve basing the aircraft at Sharjah. One of the conditions on which the Persian Government have agreed to the project is that the Persian Air Poree officer shall accompany every flight. The Political Pesident has informed us that he sees no objection, provided that the Persian Officer obtains a visa or it is made clear that he is visiting Sharjah with our consent. As we have said, it is most improbable that he will apply for a visa and presumably we shall have to devise some procedure which will save faces on both sides. ■Ve are sorry that we have to bother you to go over ground which must obviiosly have been fully explored before, but we see no alternative. !e ore sending a copy of this letter to Bahrain. Yours ever,No . C/209 (3/k ) THE POLITICAL AGENCY KUWAITj 20 th August, 1949 Please refer to your letter No.248/3/49 dated the 26th May, 1949* I have no comments to make on the second para of the Tehran Chancery letter. I have caused an extensive search to be made for any correspondence with the Residency about the question of Kuwaitis at Khorramshahr; but have not yet been able to find any. Perhaps the Consul at Khorramshahr could find it. 3. Most of the Persians who come here do so without any papers at all. They are allowed to land and to remain if security is given for them by a merchant of standing in Kuwait. Others carry Identity Certificates ( ) which are recognized here. H.E.

The file largely consists of correspondence between British officials regarding several specific incidents, including one case in which a Kuwaiti dhow was reportedly seized by a Persian warship (the
                           Babr) off Henjam [Henjān], and towed to Bandar Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās]. Much of the correspondence surrounding this case and others is concerned with establishing whether or not the incidents occurred within Persian territorial waters.The file discusses more generally the British perspective regarding the extent of Persia's territorial waters and the Persian Navy's right to stop and search foreign vessels in the Gulf. Also included are instructions from the Admiralty regarding the attitude that should be adopted by His Majesty's ships in the Gulf in response to incidents of interference by Persian vessels.The principal correspondents are the following:Political Agent, Kuwait;Political Resident in the Persian Gulf;British Minister, Tehran (later referred to as His Majesty's Ambassador, Tehran);British Chargé d'Affaires, Tehran;Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir As-Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ];Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs;Foreign Office;India Office;Admiralty;Persian [Iranian] Ministry of Foreign Affairs;Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.Some of the correspondence dating from after 1935 refers to 'Iranian' rather than 'Persian' vessels, presumably in response to the Iranian Government's request for the international community to refer to the state by its historical name.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00009b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
