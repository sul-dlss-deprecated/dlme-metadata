The letters are from friends, acquaintances and other correspondents, including a number of army officers, diplomats, writers and travellers with an interest in Persia.Many of the letters discuss the internal affairs of Persia and British policy regarding the country, mostly from the perspective of British officers and diplomats who are residing or have visited there. Also discussed are Russian interests in Persia.Reference is made to Curzon being informally known as the Member of Parliament for Persia, given his experience of travelling through the country; references are also made to Curzon's recent book,
                           Persia and the Persian Question(in one of several letters to Curzon, Percy Molesworth Sykes submits a short list of corrections for certain passages).Of particular note are a series of enclosures included in a letter from Albert Houtum-Schindler to Curzon, consisting of a translation of a proclamation from the Shah of Persia, as well as translations of a Persian Government concession and a convention between Persia and Russia on the subject of railways in Persia (ff 42-62). A copy of another Persian Government concession, which is written in French, is also included, as is a short list of additions to an existing list on the genealogy of the Qajar dynasty, which was originally included in an earlier letter from Houtum-Schindler to Curzon (see Mss Eur F111/60, ff 102-156).The French language material consists of the aforementioned concession and one item of correspondence.Other notable correspondents include the following: Charles Edward Yate, British Consul General, Meshed; Sir Henry Mortimer Durand; George Sutherland Mackenzie; Conyngham Greene; Benjamin W Stainton.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Albert Schindler</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Henry Mortimer Durand</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Benjamin W Stainton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>William Conyngham Greene</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Molesworth Sykes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002ac#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
