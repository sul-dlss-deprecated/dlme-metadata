OUTSTANDING DUES OWING TO M/S ON CONSIGNMENTS OF TEA, SUGAR, GRAY MACKENZIE RADIO &amp; CYCLES Reference your No. 3572-16/57-11 dated the scember 1948 , found by the undersigned while on a visit to this/ Consulate: 2. Despite a pencilled note from Mr Abdur Rahman to the then caretaker clerk of this/ Consulate, the late Mr Barduli, stating these bills (referred to in your letter under reference) had been paid, the present Agent of M/s Gray Mackenzies assured the undersigned quite definitely that no credit entries appeared in his books in respect to them. It may therefore be assumed that the report of the caretaker in his earlier letter No. 116 of the 15th November, 1948, to the effect that the bills had not been paid, was correct. The pencilled note referred to runs follows: 'Dear Mr Barduli, I have seen our r 'and find payments have been made 'these bills. 'Yours, 'Abdul Rahman. 7/3' 3- It seems fairly definite that payments had not been made, but if it is still desired to enquire from Mr Abdul Rahman why he made the above apparently incorrect statement, he is understood by at present working as Agent at Bushire, but due to return to Bandar Abbas in a month f s time. 4. Since this Consulate is now finally closing down, it is regretted that we are unable to help you any further. Any further correspondence should be with Colonel Alban personally (as these were personal bills) and/or Messrs Gray Mackenzie. • H. M. Vice-Consul, Shiraz, in Superintendence at H.M.
