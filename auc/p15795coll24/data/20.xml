Said was born in Qurna, and his father was a government employee in Aswan who he used to visit the family once a month. He tells of being raised by his mother, who despite being illiterate ensured that he and his siblings received an education. Said works for the Ministry of Education and his four brothers as government employees and three sisters as housewives.  He shares his memories of significant past events, such as the 1967 war and the death of President Gamal Abdel-Nasser. He discusses the displacement from Qurna and its negative impact on residentsâ€™ incomes as it had been a tourist destination. Said points to the advantages of the relocation, with better electric, gas, and sewage systems provided, but notes that in Old Qurna people had more interaction with each other.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
