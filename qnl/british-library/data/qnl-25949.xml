Prom the point of view of developing relations between India and Iraq the proposal seems admirable but from the point of view of the internal stability of Iraq is open to the objection that the Regent has already been absent from the country for a considerable time this year and that the affairs of the country might suffer if he went abroad again in the near future.

The Foreign Office ■whom we have consulted think that it would be as well to obtain the views of Ambassador, ^ Baghdad, before giving a final reply to the Viceroy regarding his proposal to invite the Regent of Iraq and NuriAaid to visit India. In informing the Ambassador of the proposal and requesting his views, the Foreign Office are commenting as follows: H Frotn the point of view of developing relations between India and Iraq the proposal seems admirable but from the point of view of the internal stability of Iraq it is open tof^ objection that the Regent has already been absent for a considerable period this year and that the affairs of the country might suffer if he went abroad again in the near future.

He thought that the proposal for the Regent of Iraq to visit India was quite a good idea, but was not so sure about Nuri Said. Although he is of course the foremost political figure in Iraq, he is not Prime Minister at the moment, and does not in fact I think hold any office. I said we would let them have a letter so that they could consider the matter before giving a definite opinion. A draft is attached accordingly.(ft) 24 OCT 1945 My Secretary of State has had a telegram from the Viceroy saying, that G-eneral Sir Arthur Smith has suggested to him tliat a visit to India by the Regent of Iraq vould be a good thing. The Government of India had already been considering an invitation to a small Iraqi Mission to visit India, partly to consolidate commercial relations and partly as an appreciation of the cordiality of the Iraqi Government towards Indian troops during the war. Lord Wavell feels however that a visit by the Regent, who might, he suggests, be accompanied by Nuri Said, would be a better idea.
