WHEREAS it is expedient to permit certain transactions in immovable property and to re-establish the Land Registry Oflices : It IS HEREBY ORDERED as follows : 1. This Ordinance applies to all immovable property the subject of the Land Law of 7 Ramadan 127L as well as to mulk land, all forms of wakf land and everv other other form of immovable property, and shall be substituted as far as it applies for the Proclamation of 18th November 1918 concerning immovable property. 2. The expression “ disposition ” in this Ordinance means a sale, mortgage, ^ift, dedication of wakf of every description and any other disposition of immovable property, and includes a transfer or other disposition of a mortgage and also a lease for a term of more than three years. 3. No disposition of immovable property will be valid until the provisions of this Ordinance have been complied with. 4. Any person wishing to make a disposition of immovable property must first obtain the written consent of the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. In order to obtain this consent, a petition must be presented to the Military Governor of the district in which the land is situated, setting out the terms of the agreement intended to be made and applying for his consent to a disposition in accordance with the agreement. The petition must contain an application for registration of a deed to be executed for the purpose of carrying into effect the terms of the agreement. \ he petition may also include a clause fixing the damages to be paid by either party who ref uses to complete the disposition if it is approved. 5. If the application for registration is made by an agent or nominee on behalf of a principal, the agent or nominee shall make full disclosure in his petition of the principal for whom he is acting, and the immovable property disposed of shall be registered in the name of the principal. li at any time it appears in a Judicial proceeding that immovable property has been registered under this Ordinance otherwise than in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Court shall inquire into the case and make a report to the Chief Administrator, who may impose upon any of the parties concerned such penalties by way of fine or forfeiture of the property in whole or in part as he may think fit. 6. Vv hen the person acquiring the immovable property is permanently resident in Palestine the consent of the Administration will be given through the Military Governor of the district in which the land is situated, provided that the disposition complies with both the following conditions :— (a) That the area of the immovable property does not exceed 200 donums. (b) That the value of the immovable property does not exceed £E. 1,000. 7. The Military Governor shall withhold his consent in* the case of agricultural land unless he is satisfied that the person acquiring the land intends himself to cultivate it. He shall also withhold his consent in the case of a disposition of any immovable property if he is of opinion that the person acquiring the immovable property is obtaining an excessive amount thereof in any particular neighbourhood. 8. Excepting the cases complying with the conditions set out in section 6 hereof, all dispositions shall be referred to the Chief Administrator for his consent, which he may give or withhold in his absolute discretion. 9. After the consent of the Administration has been obtained a deed shall be executed in the form prescribed by Rules made in accordance with section 15 hereof and the deed shall be registered in the Land Registry. 10. No mortgage shall be accepted for registration unless it complies with the terms of the Provisional Law for the mortgage of immovable property of 16 Rabia Tani 1331, and the amendments of the said law. 11. Every disposition to which the written consent of the Administration has not been obtained shall he null and void, provided that any person that has paido monoy in respect of a disposition which is null and void may recover the same by action in the Courts. 12 If any person is a party to any disposition of immovable property which has not received the consent of the Administration and either enters into possession or permits the other party to enter into possession ol the immovable property, whether bv himself or any person on his behalf, he shall be liable on conviction by a Court of First Instance to payment of a line not exceeding one-fourth of the value of the immovable property. 13. When any immovable property passes by operation of a will or by inheri tance, the legatees or heir, as the case may be, shall be jointly or severally responsible for the registration of the immovable property in the name of the legatees or heirs within a year of the death. The registration shall be made upon the certificate of a competent Court stating that the person or persons requiring registration are entitled as legatees or heirs or upon a certificate signed by the Mukhtar or Imam and two notables. . . . If registration does not take place within one year of the death, an additional registration fee of 5 per cent, of the value of the immovable property shall be levied by way of a fine for each year or part of a year during which there has been default. 14. The provisions of the Proclamation of 24th June 1918 preventing the Courts from giving a decision as to ownership of land and from oidering the sale of immovable property in execution of a judgment or in satisfaction of a mortgage shall be cancelled. The highest bidder for any immovable property so sold must apply for the consent of the Administration in manner laid down by this Ordinance, and the property shall not be registered in his name until that consent has been obtained. If the consent is withheld the Land Registry shall forthwith be notified and the property shall again be put up to auction 10 days after the notification. At this auction all bids shall be recorded and any bidder shall be deemed to have made an irrevocable offer to buy the property. The property shall be sold to the highest bidder who can obtain the consent of the Administration. 15. The Senior Judicial Officer may with the sanction of the Chief Administrator re-establish a Land Registry Office in such places as may seem desirable and may appoint such number of registrars and assistant registrars as may be necessary. The general superintendence and control over all Land Registry Offices shall be vested in the Senior Judicial Officer, who, with the sanction of the Chief Administrator, may from time to time make rules as to any of the following matters :— (a) The organisation, procedure and business of the Land Registration Offices. (b) The function and duties of the Registrar and other officials of the Land Registry Office. (c) The mode in which the Register is to be kept. (d) The forms to be used for deeds and documents. (c) The requirements for attestation and official verification of the execution of deeds. (/) The fees payable for or in connection with registration. icj) Any other matter or thing, whether similar or not to those above mentioned, in respect of which it may be expedient to make rules for the purpose of carrying this Ordinance into effect. This Ordinance shall be called “ The Transfer of Land Ordinance, 1919.” 2.—Note by Dr. Weizmaim, dated 6th September 1919. I have carefully considered the proposed Ordinance regulating sales and transactions of immovable property in Palestine, upon which you advised me in your letter of 18th August that Lord Curzon desired to have my views. Realising the inconveniences occasioned by the absolute prohibition of all transaction in land, the Zionist Organisation appreciates the need of a relaxation of the present restrictions. It also appreciates the intention of His Majesty’s Govern ment, as expressed in the proposed Ordinance, to prevent indiscriminate dealings in land for speculative purposes. I cannot but view with concern, however, the relaxation of the restrictions regarding the dedication of wakf and the transfer of property by way of gift. Tho3 economic life of the country does not require at the present moment the opening of the cadastres, either for the making of gifts or the dedication of wakfs. If the restrictions regarding the creation of new wakfs are removed, it is likely that a considerable part of the land of the country will be made wakf, not in order to promote charitable or religious purposes so much as to remove the land from the effective control of the Government and to frustrate needed reforms. You are aware that the dedication of property to wakf does not necessarily deprive the donor and his family of valuable interests therein. Whatever land policy may be adopted in the future, the situation should not certainly be prejudiced unnecessarily before the mandate is issued. The Ordinance ought, therefore, it is submitted, to be modified so as to expressly exclude the dedication of wakf and transfer by way of gift. I presume that under the proposed Ordinance no objection will be raised to the purchase of land for settlement purposes by Jewish bodies, such as the Jewish National Fund, the Jewish*Colonisation Association, the Palestine Land Development Company, and other bodies approved by the Zionist Organisation, of the public purposes and bona fides of which the Government is satisfied. In view of the possible issuance of the mandate within the next few months, and in order to avoid the accusation of surprise on the part of any elements of the community, it is suggested that the Ordinance be not made effective before 1st January 1920. C. H. Weizmann. 3.—Note by Mr. C. C. Garbett, C.I.E., I.C.S., dated 1st October 1919. 1. The draft Ordinance consists of two parts : the first, regulations regarding the disposition of immovable property ; the second, the establishment of Land Registration Offices. , It is proposed, apparently, to institute both pari passu. If Mesopotamian experience may be considered a guide, it would be wise to defer the regulations permitting land tranfers until it is certain that the Land Registration Offices are working well. It will probably be found in Palestine, as elsewhere in Turkey, that the best of title deeds contain inconsistencies and inaccuracies, that many title deeds are of doubtful validity, and that there are areas for which no proper deeds exist. If transfers such as are contemplated are to be permitted with the approval of the Administration, the Administration must take every precaution against being a party to fraudulent claims and fraudulent transfers, otherwise it will be laying up for the future inhabitants of Palestine an unlimited extent of disastrous litigation, and incurring for itself a very grave odium. 2. The way the problem was faced in the Baghdad Vilayet was that the Registration Offices were opened primarily for the registration of title in town properties only. The towns were divided into Mohallas, and the inhabitants of each Mohalla were invited to attend the Registration Offices at a specified time, bringing their original deeds together with copies. These copies they were invited to prepare on forms which were issued by the Administration ; or, if they chose, certified copies were made for them at a slight cost. These originals and copies were presented to a Committee at which the Mukhtar of their quarter and at least two notables sat. In this way the more obvious frauds were avoided. After registration had been completed, the public were allowed to make transfers. A similar system was to be extended gradually to the districts and agricultural land. It is to be remembered that the only final proof of title in Turkey are title deeds registered at the head office at Constantinople. During the war local offices suffered damage, and the head office was of course cut off. Transfers ip land were therefore deliberately reduced in Baghdad to a minimum until such time as the records at Constantinople would be available for the settlement of disputes. It is suggested, therefore, that if the Ordinance is to be promulgated, effect should be given first to that portion which deals with the opening of Registration Offices. % 3 __( a ) As to the text itself, it is observed that the restrictions regarding the sale of land to foreigners, which are enforced in Mesopotamia, find no place in this draft. Under the Turkish law of Jemadi-ul-awal of 1284 A.H., foreigners were permitted to acquire land in Turkey provided that they forewent all benefits otherwise accruing to them from capitulations or other treaties. In other, words a foreigner prepared to submit to Ottoman Law was permitted to acquire land. A 24 (b) Para. 4 of the Ordinance. , . . . . . , . . , It is suggested that petitions of the nature described should be signed by both parties and prefaced by a statement on oath that neither party knows of any impediment to the title of the translers. (c) Para. 8. It is suggested that some rules for the guidance of the Uhief Administrator should be drafted. Under the Oidmaiice as it stands, the Chief Administrator has apparently absolute authority to give or withhold sanction to sales or other dispositions of any land up to any extent, and it is understood that tnere aie lorn Chief Administrators. The provision restricting military Governors does not obtain in his case, and accordingly bodies such as the Jewish ^National .bund, the Jewish Colonisation Association, &amp;e., may hope to make purchases immediately. Not only is it suggested that rules for the guidance of the Chief Administrator should be drawn up, but in view of the large increase in work which publication of the Ordinance will probably involve, the Chief Administrator should perhaps have power to depute the function of giving sanction. This will be the more easy if rules for his guidance have previous authoritative approval. (d) Para. 15. The proposal that Land Registration Offices should be under the general supervision of the Senior Judicial Officer was at one time made in Mesopotamia also. But it was urged that, under Turkish Land Law, Tapu (i.e., registration) offices combined the function of registration with that of supervision over Government lands. The Tapu office is the custodian of Government rights, and it is through Tapu officials that suits to uphold these rights are brought, and squatters sued. It was, therefore, deemed inappropriate that the Tapu office should be under the Senior Judicial Officer, whose duty it was ultimately to decide such claims. The point may be worth consideration in Palestine. 4. Waqf. Broadly speaking two types of auqaf are recognised: the one religious, and the other secular. Secular auqaf would be described in English law as fees in tail with remainder to a charitable object. Property so dedicated was liable to a limited degree of supervision by the waqf department. In Mesopotamia it is subject to taxation in the same way as any other land, but, as Dr. Weizmann points out, the very slight sanctity such land acquires is not infrequently exploited for secular interests to the embarrassment of Government. The history of real property in England (and particularly the Statutes of Mortmain) show that both the dedication of estates to religious purposes and the limitations resulting from permanent entail are considered contrary to the interests of the community. The Ottoman Government passed in March 1014 an enactment the effect of which appears to have been to restrict the acquisition of reality by waqf. It would be retrograde to make such dedications easier under our administration. For these reasons 1 would subscribe to Dr. Weizmann’s suggestions that the Ordinance should not apply to dispositions of waqf land, a matter which could be deferred without hardship pending the establishment of the future Government of Palestine. C. C. Garrett. 4 - Note by Sir Edgar Bonham-Carter, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., Judicial Secretary, Baghdad, dated 5th January 1920. L I gather that the objects of the proposed Palestine Land Ordinance are— (a) 1 o check speculation in land and the formation of large estates and to enable the Government to prevent the acquisition of land by undesirable persons; (b) To provide for the reopening of the Land Registry Office. The proposed Ordinance appears to me suitable to effect these objects, though I have a lev amendments to suggest. But before discussing the provisions of the Ordinance it may be useful to deal with a few preliminary points. w. A legistry of land title lias been in existence in the Ottoman Empire for many years, the Land Registry Office being known as the Tapu Land Registry. ^registered sales and mortgages of land are invalid. The purchaser under an unregistered sale or agreement for sale cannot obtain specific performance of the contract or damages for non-fulfilment of the contract against a vendor who refuses to carry out the sale; he can, however, in the event of the sale being avoided, obtain tne return ot any purchase money paid by him.3. Although the Thirkish land registry system has considerable merits in practice it suffered from serious defects. The principal defects of the system as it operated in Mesopotamia, are the following:— (u) Notwithstanding the risks involved in non-registration, large numbers of properties, and specially of small house properties, are not registered. Waqf properties have rarely been registered. (6) As the land registry officials were neither honest nor accurate, and as no cadastrial maps existed, fraudulent deeds are not rare, and erroneous deeds are common. Generally speaking the boundaries and areas of agricultural lands shown in title deeds are of little value, if boundaries are disputed. (c) in modern systems of title registration, registration confers an absolute title except in case of fraud. A bond fide purchaser for value obtains by registration a good title against everyone. This is not so under the Turkish system, nor is it desirable that it should be so until the registers are much more accurate than at present. For instancy, if on the death of an owner some only of his heirs get registered as entitled to the whole property, and they subsequently by a registered deed sell the property to a purchaser, the excluded heirs can recover their shares from th.e purchaser though he was ignorant of the defects in his title. 1. In Mesopotamia the situation was further complicated by the destruction of the Turks on their retirement of most of the registers. 5. Before allowing dealings in land, it was necessary in Mesopotamia to reconstitute the land registers. The registration in towns was sufficiently accurate to enable the register to be reconstituted by means of the Turkish title deeds in the hands of the owners and photographic maps taken by aeroplane. But in agricultural districts the title deeds are very unreliable, and before dealings can be safely permitted a general demarcation and registration of properties must be undertaken. I understand that the land registers in Syria are much more reliable than in Mesopotamia. Hence the land registries can probably be reopened to dealings without the preliminary of a general re-registration. But before dealings in any particular property are permitted it will be necessary to hold a careful examination of the title of the property. To put the land registry in a satisfactory condition a cadastral survey, accompanied by the demarcation of all properties, and their re-registration, will, T imagine, eventually be necessary, but presumably the re-opening of the Land Registry Office need not await these measures. The need for some such measures were recognised by the Turks, and by the Provisional Law of 11 Rabi Awal, 1331, provision was made to demarcate and register all lands within the Ottoman Empire. The law, however, was not in fact carried iuto effect in Mesopotamia, nor, I understand, in Syria. 6. The proposed Ordinance vests in the Chief Administrator the power to refuse sanction to a dealing with land without giving any reason. Questions may arise as to whether this is in accordance with Turkish Law and Treaties. I am informed that the Turkish Government occasionally refused to allow transactions in land on the ground that the persons acquiring the land was unde sirable, though that might not be given as the ostensible reason. The law on the subject is not altogether clear, but I am advised that the Government had this power as regards “ miri ” land, but not as regards “ mulk ” land. The Law of 13 Sefer, 1284 (16th June 1867) granted to foreigners the same right of acquiring and holding lands as Ottoman subjects, on the condition that as regards such lands they were liable to the same laws and regulations as Ottoman subjects. This law was issued after negotiations with the Powers and received the assent of all the chief Powers. Hence the right of a foreigner to hold land in Turkey is secured by treaty. It follows that no greater restrictions can be placed on the acquisition of land by foreigners than is placed on the acquisition of land by Ottoman subjects. The proposed Ordinance rightly makes no distinction between foreigners and Ottoman subjects. 7. According to the Mohammedan Law of Pre-emption, if an owner of mulk land sells it the owners of contiguous properties have the right within a certain period to buy out the purchaser at the price he has agreed to with the original owner. *Siinilarly, if an owner of “ miri land ’ within a village alienates it to a stranger, the 1062 A 3c inhabitants of the village, subject to certain conditions, have the right to buy out the purchaser at the price he has agreed to. The proposed Ordinance makes no reference to pre-emption or to the analogous right with regard to mm land, although by means of them an owner may be able, by adding estate, to estate to defeat the object of the Ordinance. I presume it is intended not to interfere with the right. his I think, is wise. The right of pre-emption is extremely inconvenient and it would probably be to the advantage of the community to abolish it, 01 at least to restrict it. But the right is one derived from the religions law, and if one to which Mohammedans attach considerable importance, especially in the case of town property It would seem advisable not to interfere with pre-emption until it can be dealt with by a legislative body on which the inhabitants are represented. 8 Corporations are restricted under Ottoman Law from holding land. By the Provisional Law of the 22 Rabi al Awwal, 1331, uncommercial associations and Turkish commercial companies were authorised to hold land provided they were empowered to do so in their deeds of constitution as sanctioned by the Government. Charitable instituticgis and Ottoman communities were also authorised to hold town lands. Foreign companies and corporations are not authorised to hold land. Until the passing of the above law the custom was for companies and corporations who could not hold land in their own names to vest it in the name of a nominee ; but this arrangement is expressly prohibited by the 3rd section of the above-mentioned laW * The practice of registering land in the name of a nominee was also prohibited by the Provisional Law r of the 5th Jamad II. Awwal, 1331. The law as it stands, therefore, prevents a foreign company from holding land either in its own name or that of a nominee. Amendment is necessary. 9, Turning to the provisions of the proposed Ordinance, the only general criticism I have to make is on the question of penalties. It is always open to objection to penalise acts which are not themselves wrong. Under systems of registration with which I am acquainted the only penalty for non-registration of transactions is that the transaction is void, and this was the rule under Turkish Law. It is true, however, that in the past the fact that transactions carried out outside the Land Registry were void w r as not sufficient to prevent such transactions. And I agree, therefore, that under conditions existing in Palestine the penalties imposed by section 5 and section 12 are probably necessary, if it is desired strictly to enforce the policy laid down by the Proclaniation, leaving it to the authorities concerned to remit the penalties in cases w r hen non-registration is due to ignorance and the transaction is one to which consent wamld have been granted if applied for. The penalty imposed by section 13 on heirs and legatees who fail to register within a year appears to me undesirable, and I suggest its omission. The increased registration fee charged in case the devolution is not registered within a year will in some cases be unjust and will be unpopular. It must be remembered that in Mohammedan countries the class of landowners (including owmers of houses) is a very large one and includes the most ignorant and conservative classes, and that the majority are illiterate; also, under Mohammedan law, the heirs are usually nuinerou®, often very numerous, and the shares of individuals are* often very small. Heirs are often absent or minors or women. It will be impossible for them in many cases to apply within a year, and even when possible they often will not do so. It is also relevant that any form of taxation of successions is extremely unpopular iu Mohammedan countries. Any proposal for such taxation is always met by the argument that you are taxing the widow and the orphan. Popular feeling in Syria, unless it is different to what it is in Egypt and Mesopotamia, will be strongly opposed to this clause. 10. Going through the Ordinance section by section, I have the following observations to submit:— Section 2.—The definition of disposition would include a devise by will. 1 suggest that a devise should he excluded. Section 4.—While the first paragraph includes all disposition, the wording of the second paragraph is not applicable to a proposed gift nor to an endowment of waqf. A verbal amendment is required.t The title of the person who wishes to make the disposition must be examined either before consent is given to the transaction or that consent must be given subject to the title being in order. Some amendment of the Ordinance is necessary to make this clear. Section 5.—Tf a penalty is to be imposed on registration of land in the name of an agent for an undisclosed principal, it is not clear why the penalty is limited to the case when the fact of such registration has been disclosed in a judicial proceeding. The fact would ordinarily be detected by the Land Registry Office in connection with subsequent dealings with the land, and not in the course of a judicial proceeding. Section b and Section 9.—Some words are required to make it clear that consent to the transaction will only be given and the deed will only be registered if the title is in order. Section 10.—The effect of this section is to exclude the customary form of mortgage by “ bai al wafa.” This is the only form used in Mesopotamia and is probably the usual form in Syria. The form of mortgage authorised by the Provisional Law referred to in the section is more in accordance with modern ideas and is sounder economically. But the “bai al wafa” is more in accord with Mohammedan sentiment. One form of “ bai al wafa ” allows a mortgage without payment of interest, the mortgagee going into possession of the property and such possession taking the place of interest. This satisfies the Mohammedan objection against charging or paying interest, and should not, I consider, be prohibited, notwithstanding the objections to it on economic’grounds. Section 14.—Under the Provisional Law as to mortgages, when repayment of a mortgage debt is overdue the Land Registry Office, upon the application of the mortgagee, enforces the mortgage by sale by auction. No application to the Court is necessary. Some amendment of the section seems necessary to cover such a case. • Section 15.—I suggest adding after sub-paragraph (/), as an additional sub- paragraph, “the appointment of attorneys.” Under Turkish procedure, the parties must attend the Registry Office either personally or by duly appointed attorney, and sign the register. 15. With regard to Mr. Weizmann’s objections to the effect of the Ordinance on the creation of awqaf and gifts, it is to be remarked that under the provisions of the Ordinance waqfs can only he created and gifts can only be made after the consent of the Chief Administrator has been obtained. Mr. Weizmann’s fears that the Ordinance will lead to creation of avvqaf and gifts, with the intention of defeating its purpose, appear therefore to be unfounded. Having regard to the religious issues involved, the Ordinance, in nw opinion, goes as far as is advisable in restricting the creation of waqf and gifts. Indeed, unless there is real reason to apprehend that the removal of restrictions will lead to the creation of awqaf with the object of defeating the purpose of the Ordinance, it appears to me that it would be preferable at the present time to place no restriction on the creation of awqaf. According to the practice followed by the Courts in Mesopotamia, a waqf can only be created by declaration before a qadhi. If the same rule exists in Syria, the Administration can keep themselves informed of all awqaf created, and provisions to restrict the creating of awqaf might be postponed until it was proved that Mr. Weizmann’s fears are well founded. 16. With regard to the views expressed by Mr. Garbett and Colonel Howell that it is preferable for the Land Registry Office to be under the Chief Revenue Authority rather than the Chief Legal Authority, I will only say that, while under existing conditions I have no objection to the Land Registry Office in this country being under the Revenue authorities, I have seen no reason to alter the opinion which I have previously expressed, namely, that the business of a Register of 'Title is essentially legal and is most suitably placed under the supervision of a legal authority. E. Bonham Carter.8 5.—Note by Lieut-Col. E. B. Howell, C.S.I., C.I.E., I.C.S., dated 5th December 1919. The Secretary of State has asked for your views and those of Mr. Bonham Carter and other Mesopotamian experts on the draft Land Ordinance which the Palestine Administration has referred to him. Presumably comment is invited in the light of knowledge acquired by experience in Mesopotamia. The first point which I have to make is, therefore, that, to judge from the indications which the Ordinance and other enclosures to the Secretary of State’s letter afford, conditions here offer one feature of similarity to those obtaining in Palestine, but otherwise seem to be fundamentally different! The Turks themselves recognised the peculiarity of ’Iraq in respect of land tenures —vide the Circular from the Ministry of Tapu, dated 5th Safar 1310, a translation of which is given on page 12 of the Translation of Turkish Laws printed at Baghdad under No. 2363, dated 9th April 1919. The feature of similarity lies in the fact that both in ’Iraq and Palestine, as also no doubt elsewhere, the Turkish Government attempted, using the Tapu Department as its instrument, to maintain a complete and systematic registry of title, and to record all private rights in immovable property, without taking the trouble to provide the necessary safeguards in the shape of survey maps, well-ordered registers, records and reasonable departmental efficiency of routine. Here, moreover, except in Mosul, such record as existed was destroyed or thrown into confusion by the war, whereas in Palestine events, as in Mosul, seem to have moved too quickly to enable the Turks to add to our difficulties by the deliberate destruction or removal of their records. The Palestine Ordinance is*silent as to whether a would-be vendor of land has to produce his title-deeds or not, and there is no information on record here to show whether, at present, an owner of immovable property in Palestine who has lost his deeds can get new ones or not. If the production of deeds is a sine qua non, and no machinery exists for the issue of new deeds, the relaxation of restriction .which the Ordinance purports to effect may be more apparent than real. If production is not necessary there is clearly a wide opening for fraud and much trouble brewing for the future Registrar. If machinery for renewal does exist, it would be interesting to know how the procedure compares with that used by the Turks and the modifications of their system which we have introduced here. It is 'believed that in Palestine the efficiency of the Turkish Tapu Department was considerably more respectable than here. Nevertheless, in so far as there, too, it seems to have fallen short of a reasonable standard, and suffered to some extent by the war, the problems are the same. Here in Mesopotamia (except in Mosul) the administration set up by us met this difficulty at the beginning by prohibiting all transfers of immovable property, and then, as it evolved order out of chaos, by relaxing this prohibition in respect first of urban properties, and then of garden lands in suburban and certain riverain areas. Beyond this point we have not yet advanced, and transfer of agricultural lands still cannot be registered, although it is hoped that the inception of settlement operations in the Baghdad and Hillah Divisions will soon extend the activities of the Tapu Department to agricultural lands also in those areas. The same difficulty seems to have been met in the same obvious manner in Palestine. But clearly the difficulty there cannot have been so acute as here, or the way to the re-opening of transactions in immovable properties could not have been so speedily cleared. Curiously enough as it might seem, the closure of transfers of agricultural lands in this country, which has now lasted for more than four years in some parts, has caused practically no public inconvenience. The reason for this is the complete divorce that existed here between the actual and the theoretical position. A comparatively small portion of the country is even claimed by persons who take their stand upon legal documents (Tapu Sanads). Of these a fair proportion have never, or not for a long time, held actual possession. Even before our arrival they were already well accustomed merely to receive some sort of annual payment from the persons in actual possession, enough to keep them quiet, and make the best of that. Naturally there is no lively traffic in such precarious rights as these. Nevertheless, many landowners and occupants do exercise the usual rights of such persons. Such are usually prosperous, and by no means anxious to part with their lands. Land owners, and garden owners, and house owners alike, in defiance or oblivion of the law, have always been very careless about registration and the renewal of deeds. Registration was only theoretically compulsory under the Turks, and one of our chief difficulties here, even in urban areas, has been to get the people to produce their deeds for registration. This apathy seems due partly to a natural distrust engendered9 by the inefficiency of the Tapu Department in Turkish times, partly to the fact that registration and renewal involve the payment of a certain, if small, fee. The combination of doubtful benefit and certain expense makes no appeal to the Arab. In each of the three divisions of Mosul, Erbil and Kirkuk a reformed Tapu Office deals with urban properties. Outside the towns in Erbil and Kirkuk, there is little land registered in Tapu, and all that we are attempting to do is to keep an informal record of such transactions in non-urban land as are reported, with details of price, A:c., but without any guarantee. Difficulties such as those indicated above, which we are taking steps to meet in our own way, do not, I believe, confront the administration in Palestine. There the Turkish Tapu Department, though inefficient, did more or less maintain an actual record of marketable rights, and the administration has had to give way to the necessities of those who own land and desire or are constrained to sell it. It has, however, sets its face against the transfer of large properties, a transaction which is less likely to arise from necessity than the sale of small plots by the peasantry, and is especially eager to check speculative purchase. For these purposes the Ordinance seems well enough adapted, but I think Mr. Garbett’s advice sound. He urges the administration in Palestine to satisfy itself that the registration offices are really in working order before the attempt to work them is made. The point which Mr. Garbett deals with in para. 3 (d) of his note is, 1 think, of very great importance. There is no need to elaborate the argument as set forth there, but we can say. with the experience of four years behind us, that the system whereby the Tapu Department is supervised by the Chief Revenue Authority has worked well in Mesopotamia on the whole, and that there is now no serious demand that Tapu should be under the management of the Senior Judicial Officer. As to waqf lands, it may be inferred that in Palestine many Moslem landowners, through fear of the Zionist movement, would seek to protect themselves by making their lands “ dhurriyah ” or waqf in reversion. Here there is no such fear and no such tendency. Nor have we had any inconvenience here from bequests of immovable property to waqf, which w'e would desire to respect, but which we might be unable to register. No such bequests in respect of agricultural land or gardens have, as a matter of fact, come to notice. I attribute this partly to the fact that waqf here is very adequatel}' endowed already, partly to the supreme lack of confidence which that Department inspired in a country largely Shia’, where it was most partially administered for the benefit of Sunnis, and partly to the paucity of lands held in mulk right, which alone are capable of being made the subject of a bequest. * A few remarks as to the checking of speculative traffic in lands, and the acquisition of rights by foreigners, in Mesopotamia, may be offered. Presumably the Palestine administration considers that its powers to withhold sanction to proposed transfers will enable it to deal with both these. Probably this will be found adequate, and the omission of all attempt to fetter discretion is, at this stage, wise, though some general declaration of principle will before long, I think, be forced upon them. I consider that in respect of those two objects, our policy, declared in the Civil Commissioner’s Notification of the 20th November 1917, 24th February 1918, rnd the General Officer Commanding’s Proclamation of the 30th July 1919, has been completely successful. It may be noted that the measures referred to in the preceding paragraph restrict rights conferred by the Turkish law. If Mr. Weizmann’s views are to be carried out it will be necessary to widen certain provisions of the Turkish law. Formerly no private corporate body could hold real property as a body, and though the law of 16th February 1328 makes certain concessions in this respect, it restricted the owner ship of real property by agricultural companies to “ Ottoman companies the share holders in which are Ottoman subjects.” Unless, therefore, the shareholders in the various companies mentioned by Mr. Weizmann are all Ottoman subjects, it would appear that special legislation will be necessary to enable them to acquire agricultural land. % E.

Included with the ordinance are notes by the following individuals: Chaim Weizmann, President of the British Zionist Federation; Colin Campbell Garbett, Assistant Secretary for the India Office; Sir Edgar Bonham-Carter, Judicial Secretary, Baghdad, and Lieutenant-Colonel Evelyn Berkeley Howell, Revenue Secretary, Mesopotamia. Each party was invited to suggest amendments to the proposed ordinance and provide advice owing to their experiences with land ordinances and land registry in Mesopotamia with the exception of Weizmann who was invited to comment from the point of view of Palestinians.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>President</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Judicial Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Revenue Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Land use</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Palestine</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00032c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
