There is an index of cases, numbered 1 to 19, at the front of the file (folio 2). Each case has its own cover sheet, and there are office notes included either before or after each set of case correspondence.</extent><extent>Foliation: The file has been foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover, using circled numbers in the top-right corner of each recto page. The following foliation anomalies occur: 1, 1A, 2, 2A.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence related to twenty manumission applications made by slaves from Qatar, taken down by staff at the Political Agency in Bahrain. Many of the cases in the file feature only the slave's manumission statement, with little else in the way of correspondence.In the first case in the file, there is a British manumission certificate (folio 6), and an original, handwritten manumission certificate, given to a slave by his master (folio 5). Case 3 involves the manumission application of a female slave from Qatar, found embracing the flagstaff at the Political Agency in Bahrain. The woman also requests the retrieval of her children, who are in the custody of the Shaikh of Qatar. There are angry exchanges in letters between the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain Tom Hickinbotham) and Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī, over access to the children (folios 22-23, 25-26), with Shaikh ‘Abdullāh stating that he resents 'interference in matters about which agreements were concluded [in 1916] between me and H.E. Sir Percy Cox'. Office notes suggest that the mother lied about the ages of her children, resulting in the Agency having 'got into trouble with the Shaikh of Qatar' (folio 14).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000234#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000234#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000234#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
