Huskeljee and E. Kumroodeen, Bombay.Distinctive Features:Relief shown by hachures.Below the title note ‘Reduced in the Quarter Master Generals Office from an Original Map by Colonel T Dickinson, Chief Engineer. Signed Neil Campbell, Lieutenant-Colonel, Acting Quarter Master General'.A detailed explanation of the various surveys, expeditions and engraved charts used to compile the map from 1819 to 1839 is given along with descriptions of the various routes shown on the map, and others which were referred to in the compiling of this map. The description was compiled by the Chief Engineers Office, Bombay, 4 April 1843.
                           Inscriptions:Numerous annotations concerning the routes, topography of the regions and local tribes, with submarine telegraph cable and two circles based on Ras Musandam and Bushire, inserted in black ink and pencil.The verso of the map contains a report written by Lewis Pelly, to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, 17 February 1863 on the landscape of the Persian Gulf, tribal ownership of coastline areas and pearl banks, and regarding the area surrounding Bushire. The report starts by describing the area from Kuwait to Dhahran, which Pelly claims is known as Adân [Al ‘Adān]; the area from Katiffe [Al Qaţīf] to Ojair [Al ‘Uqayr], which he refers to as Hujar, and the area from Ojair to the ports of the Beni Yas [Banī Yās] which he describes as Qatar. Within the Qatar area Pelly refers to Zabareh [Zubārah] which he describes as a place of note and considerable population and trade some 40 years previously. Pelly then proceeds to describe the areas the Wahabees [Wahhabi] claim ownership to; to describe the village of Cassab [Khaşab]; and to describe the pearl banks of the Persian Gulf, including their shared ownership, fishing processes, where the pearls are sold too, and how they are managed and patrolled during the pearl season. Further points made in the report include a possible overland route to Aden; and descriptions of Bushire including its agricultural population, estimated trade, taxes paid by local families. The report concludes by laying out possible ways in which the British Government and its armies could access Persia via Bushire or Hallilah [Heleh?] should they wish to launch a military offensive, including accessibility of various routes and the best times to travel on them.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Neil Campbell</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">surveyor</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Thomas Malcolm Dickinson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">surveyor</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023514290.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
