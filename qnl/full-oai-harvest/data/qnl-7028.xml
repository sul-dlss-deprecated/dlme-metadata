The majority of the file contains correspondence regarding the decision to send a Doctor Pirdie and Colonel Findlay as representatives of the UK, and includes discussions of travel arrangements and dress code.   The main correspondents are as follows Sir John Helier Le Rougetel (HM Ambassador to Iran); the British Embassy, Cairo and the Government of India, External Affairs Department. The file also includes a telegram addressed to the Foreign Office from Le Routegel relaying information received from the French Embassy and the physician of the British Embassy in Iran, Tehran.  The telegram suggests that plans to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the opening of the Persian Pasteur Institute have been organised in order to jeopardise an inspection planned by the French Pasteur Institute and to prevent their plans to replace the current Persian head. The United States of America’s planned representation is discussed and concern over potential Russian involvement in the event of the United Kingdom’s failure to send a representative is also expressed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Health</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Pasteur Institute of Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Anniversary celebrations</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy, Cairo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Teheran</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00019f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
