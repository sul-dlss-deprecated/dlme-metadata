The list of common A series files, with their B series numbers (folios 2-5a) is arranged numerically by A series file number (1 through to 92). The index to the main headings (folios 6-12) is arranged alphabetically. The main headings (folios 15-241) are arranged by the heading number. Many of the main headings were allocated several folios to accommodate future expansion to the lists, the result being that there is often one or more blank folios included at the back of each list where the additional space was never required.</extent><extent>Foliation: The volume is foliated from the front cover to the inside back cover, using circled pencil numbers in the top-right corner of each folio. The following foliation anomalies occur: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 5a.Condition: There is a small amount of insect damage towards the front and back of the volume, in the form of small holes in the paper. This damage is not sufficient to impair the legibility of any of the volume’s contents.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume is an index of those files created by staff at the Persian Gulf Residency, that came under the general heading ‘B Series’. The B Series was created in 1945 from those A Series files (see the A Series index at Z/R/15/1/1) that remained open at this time. New B series files were opened until the closure of the Residency in 1947. The bulk of the volume is made up of lists of files, arranged under subject heading numbered from 1 through to 95. The file lists under each subject heading include a file number, file title, and original (A Series) file number. There is an explanatory introduction to the index on folios 13-14.The original lists in the volume are typewritten, with additional annotations in pen. The lists, including many of the handwritten additions, are a duplicate of those in IOR/Z/R/15/1/2. Comparison of the two volumes would suggest that this volume was copied at a later date from IOR/Z/R/15/1/2.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022598726.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
