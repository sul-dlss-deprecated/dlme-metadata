September 1903./ Discretionary power is given to officers, not below the position of Commanding Officers, of H.M. Ships, to communicate, in special cases, to other persons belonging to II.M. Service, any portion of the contents of this book, with which it may be absolutely necessary for them to ho acquainted in carrying out their duties. Ihe Officers exorcising this power will bo held responsible that such information is imparted with duo caution and reserve. This report is to be considered as the official standard of information for matters relating to defence only./ r 5 © N.B.—It is of the utmost importance that the information contained in this book should be verified and supplemented whenever an oppor tunity offers. REMARKS ON COLLECTING INFORMATION.* General. Any proceedings likely to offend foreign susceptibilities should be scrupulously avoided. It is most important to be exact, especially in figures. Any doubt as to the accuracy of information should be clearly expressed. It is important to state how and where an object reported on was observed. Vague relative terms such as “ right,” “ left,” &amp;c. should be avoided, unless such are accompanied by an explanatory note. Magnetic bearings should be used for direction as 'far as possible. Much useful work may be carried out with a pocket compass. As much use as possible should be made of good local maps, and the original or a tracing, should be attached to the report. The report, which should supplement the map, should be clear and concise. When a report is written amplifying information contained in this book, the same order of subjects should be adopted to facilitate comparison. This applies especially to corrections or additions to tabular forms. In the case of defence works the statement of armament should be clearly separated from the description. Names of places, &amp;c. should be given in block letters the first time they occur. When local spelling is found to differ to any extent from the Admiralty system, to be found in “ Sailing Directions,” both versions should be given to facilitate reference to foreign maps and charts. Defences. To a report on a fort or battery should be attached, where Forts &amp;c. practicable— (a) a plan showing the shape of the work, with a table of estimated measurements ; the number, calibre, position, bearing, arcs of fire, and height above the sea of the guns ; particulars as to search-lights and range-finders, and as much explanatory information as possible (without confu sion) both as to the work itself and the immediate * Portions of these remarks do not at present apply to the Persian Gulf but may do so at a future time and are retained in an^ case for the sake of uniformity with other similar reports.Defended Areas. Minefields, &amp;c. / r 6 surroundings. No detailed plans of works (with traverses, &amp;c. drawn to scale) should be attempted, unless the information is very certain, and can be obtained without waste of time ; (b) figured profiles of the parapets and ditches ; (Note. —The form and thickness of a parapet are often much more important than the actual shape of the work.) (c) a hand sketch, or, better still, a photograph, of the appearance of the work viewed from the front on a named bearing. All plans and sketches should be dated and signed, and all plans should bear the magnetic and true north points and scale. These remarks apply also to reports dealing with a system of defences with the following modifications :— ( 1 .) Where two or more batteries lie close together, they should, if possible, be shown on the same plan. ( 2 .) Hand sketches or photographs of a defended locality, showing the appearance when viewed (on named bearings) from a ship within reasonable range, are very valuable ; but small photographs, taken at great distances, are rarely of much use. The position and particulars of minefields should be given, where possible, noting the exact position of each observation station, and any information regarding boom defence, where such exists. Many of the above particulars can best be observed from a ship’s deck. Other Information. In addition to descriptions of defences, information on any of the following points is very desirable :— 1 . Dockyards. —Capabilities, with plans. 2. .Shipyards. —Number and size of building slips, cranes, &amp;e., with plans. 3. Engineering Works. —Plans. 4. Fuel .—Stock maintained (Government and private), with description. 5 . Communications. —Railways, details of, including position of stations. Tramways. Roads. Inland waterways. Steamships. Telegraphs. Telephones. Wireless stations. Homing pigeon service. Submarine cables, showing on the plan where shore end is landed, and stating if protected or not by guns. 6 . Garrison. —Rank and position of commandant. Number and composition. Means of reinforcing. 7. Water Supply. —Position of reservoirs and pipe lines.y r r 7 Ordnance. The particular type of mounting should be reported whenever possible. The form of the carriage and such details as com pressors, loading derricks, &amp;c. should be described, as a gun may often be identified by them. Detailed technical descriptions of artillery and mining materiel employed should be sent in whenever practicable, and should be in the shape of separate reports. Under-water Defences. Ascertain, if possible, what description of mines are used in the various minefields, and what numbers of each type of mine are available for the purpose. Information as to the number and position of torpedo batteries and the number of torpedoes, type, &amp;c. supplied should be sought for.List of Maps and Plates accompanying this Report.

RESOURCES AND COAST DEFENCES, 1903. INTRODUCTORY NOTE. Information extracted from the “ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898, forms the groundwork of this Report, especially as regards geographical details, supplies of food, &amp;c. . As far as existing information allows, all places of special interest on the coast line of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman 1 i&lt;ly 6 been noticed, but as portions of the coast are very little known, it is possible that further points of interest may be dis closed by surveys now (1903) in progress. T he Report embodies a great deal of the available information tending to throw light on the naval, military, and political value of the various places described, but it will be observed that in many cases our local knowledge is very incomplete; indeed, one of the chief objects of the Report is to draw attention to this fact, in order that the deficiency may be remedied. Roth in the course of the Report and in the Historical Notes of the Appendix, some record has been made of the more important British operations by land and sea in this region. British authority has been supreme in the Persian Gulf lince the end of the 18th century, and previous to the Persian War of 1856-57 there were several small expeditions besides that of 1819-20, but from want of detailed information it has not been possible 5 to describe them. MASKAT (MUSCAT). (See Admiralty Charts, 2869, 10c, 38, and 2837a.) Maskat is situated near the E. point of Arabia. It is the capital of the Sultanate of Oman, and an important trading port. The government has treaties with Great Britain. France’, and the United States.12 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Passage distances.

There is no exact infonnation beyond this, but it is understood that there are no important routes from Maskat direct to the interior. Steuwers.—There is a fortnightly mail service with India and the Persian Gulf, conducted by the British India Steam Naviga tion Company.

It aa ill be observed that the fort guards the gap between the S. end of Maskat Island and the mainland. It is not known if there are any guns in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). The Armament, armament of (o^) and (4) is stated to consist of old Portuguese guns, dated 1606, and of old S.B. guns presented many years ago by the Indian Government. Some of these guns Avere used during the entente in 1895, but the fire is stated to have been very ineffective. Existing Land Defences. The toAvn is surrounded by a Avail with gates. There is no information as to its condition. The Avails near Tuyan village are guarded by a toAver. In the mountain passes leading to the low ground on which the toAvn stands are various tovA'ers and Avails which are clearly shown on Chart 2869.14 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Remarks on Land Defence. It will be observed from the chart that— ( 1 ) The town and walls are commanded at close range by hills. ( 2 ) There are four passes and some valleys to be guarded. The main line of defence against land attack must therefore be on the hills commanding the approaches to the town. The smallest perimeter of such a line (extending from shore to shore) would apparently be about 4,600 yards. No doubt the existing towers, &amp;c.. are in the position which experience has shown to be most suitable in native warfare. The passes are stated to be very difficult. Native Forces. The Sultan has tw'o small steamers. It is understood that he is about to acquire a larger steamer. The army consists of a small regular force of Arabs, Makranis and Wahabis, who garrison the Sultan’s forts and other possessions. They are mostly armed with modern riHes ( Martini-Henry’s, &amp;c.). Information Required. General .—Any information supplementary to that in the text as to the naval and military value ot Maskat. As to additional sources of water supply.

Strength and disposition of the “ Army.” AL (EL) BATINA (or BATINEH) COAST. {See Admiralty Charts 2,837a and 752.) The coast between Maskat and the Ruus-al-Jebel Promontory is known as the A1 Batina coast. The greater portion belongs to the Sultanate of Oman (Maskat), but the section inhabited by Jowasmi Arabs between Khor Kalb a and the S. half of Hibba, inclusive, is recognised by the British Government as subject to the Sheikh of Sharjah, a “ Trucial Chief” on the Pirate Coast {see p. 18).DUIIAT HAFFA—MUSAXDAM—KHOK KAWI. 15 LUHAT HAFFA. {See Admiralty Charts 753 and 2,837 a.) Duhat Haifa is 175 miles N.W. of Maskat. This is a cove running in parallel to the coast for 2 | miles, and varying from half to a quarter of a mile in width. It is accessable to deep draught vessels. The narrow strip of land forming its E. side and terminating in Has Haifa quite masks this cove from seaward, and makes of it a land-locked harbour. 1 here are only a few fishermen here. The approximate distance of Duhat Haifa from Cape Jashk - - - is 77 miles. Khor-ash-Shem - 70 Kishm Town - - _ go MUSANDAM (MOSANDIM or MUSAN'DIM) PROMONTORY. The great promontory Kuus-al-Jebel, which marks the entrance ol the Persian Gulf, is generally referred to as the Musandam Promontory. The name Musandam, however, properly applies to an island olf the N. end of the promontory, the N point of the island being called lias Musanuam. 1 he N. portion ol this great tongue of land is very mountain ous and deeply indented by numerous inlets, two of which— Kubbat Ghazira and Khor-ash-Shem—on opposite side of the promontory at about 12 miles from the N. point, are only sepa rated bj the narrow isthmus ol Maklab (least width, three-ciuarters of a mile). H _ Of the many inlets those of chief naval interest areKhor Kawi, Khor-ash-Shem, and Khasab, all on the W. shore. KHOR KAWI. {See Admiralty Charts 753 and 2,837 a.) Khor Kawi is the strait between Jezirat-al-Ghanam and the W. shore of Musandam Promontory. (For distances see Khor- aah-Shem.) The length of the strait is 2 £ miles and the breadth at each end is f &gt;00 yards, widening within to 1,000 yards. There is deep water throughout. The island A1 Ghanam is about 1,500 yards broad, and is precipitous nearly all round. The highest Passage distances.16 PERSIAN GULF.— RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Supplies doubtful. Naval value.

Opposite the S. end of A1 Ghanam, on the mainland, is the small cove called Ghdrurn, at the head of which is a valley with date plantations. A little to the S. of Ghdrum cove is a village called Kabba. There is no information as to supplies of food or water. According to a special report made in 1900, Khor Kawi is not at all suitable as a harbour for the purpose of forming a naval and coaling station, but it would form a convenient shelter for small craft and torpedo boats using Khor-ash Sliem (9 miles S.) as a base. KHOR-ASH-SHEM (Elphinstone Inlet). {See Admiralty Charts 753 and 2837a.) Khor-ash-Shem is an extensive inlet on the W. side of Musandam Promontory, about 9 miles S. of Khor Kawi. The approximate distance of Khor-ash-Shem from— Bahrein Harbour - is 309 miles.

The following information is taken from a special report made in 1900 :— This is a splendid land-locked harbour, with a narrow winding entrance. It would take any number of large ships, the water being very deep. The best anchorage is in a bay S. of Telegraph Island. A plentiful supply of good water can be obtained by sinking artesian wells. { See the “ Pilot’’ for existing native wells.)KHOR-ASH-SHEM— K HAS AH. 17 / r IT Foi purposes of control of the Gulf entrance the position is Suitability very good. a8 naval The climate from July to September is very trying to Europeans. ( 1 he Eastern Telegraph Company had to abandon their station on Telegraph Island in 1869 ovving to the heat.) Apart from the climate, however, Khor-ash-Shem would make a very good naval and coaling station, if properly equipped with piers, sheds, lighters, &amp;c. The entrance could be defended by one or two forts or by Defence mines. AW.—The special report quoted above does not deal with the question of land defence. As far as it is possible to iudce fioin C hart ^53, it would not be difficult to cover the harbour and the isthmus of Maklab from an attack from the S. It is suggested, with reserve, that the main weakness of the harbour would be its liability to naval attack from the E., unless the deep inlets on that side were strongly defended. KHASAB. (Sec Admiralty Charts 753 and 2837 a.) Khasab Bay is about 3 miles W. of the entrance to Khor- ash-Shem. T he town of Khasab lies in the wide valley S. of the bay, a little distance from the shore. The population of the valley is about 600. A w&amp;li of the Sultan of Maskat resides here. He has little direct authority, his position being rather that of a consul than of a governor. For distances, see Khor-ash-Shem. Distances The bay lies between projecting headlands, which shelter it Anchorage from the prevailing winds ; it is about 1 mile wide, open to the N. The anchorage is good. The best landing place is at the W. end of the sandy beach Landing which forms the S. shore of the buy. place. I 26291. B18 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Supplies. Defences. J Water .—Fresh water in good wells is plentiful. I he best well is close to the hills on the E. side, about 400 yards from the beach. Food .—The valley, OAving to the presence of water for irrigation, is well cultivated. Corn, dates, vegetables, &amp;c. are grown. There is a “ fort ” near the centre of the date grove in which the town lies ; it contains the Sheikh’s house. There are two towers on the sandy beach in front of the toAvn. On the Avestern rocky point, overlooking the bay, is a small square tower. Note .—Years ago it \?as suggested that Khasab, in British hands, might become an important trading centre. It is stated that the heat is not felt so severely here as in Khor-ash-Shem. THE “PIRATE COAST.” The so-called “ Pirate Coast ” may be said to extend from Pas Sheikh Masud (close W. of Khasab) to A1 Wakra on the E. side of A1 Katr promontory, Avhich is the S. limit of Turkish influence. From S. of Bokha* to Abu Thabi (both on the W. side of the great tongue of land which terminates in the Musandam Promontory) the coast is ruled by the JoAvasmi “ Trucial Chiefs,” Avho have been under treaty obligations to Great Britain since the suppression of piracy in this part of the Gulf’.f The coast from Abu Thabi to A1 Wakra has no permanent population, but is under the influence of the “ Trueial Chiefs.” It should he noted that that portion of the El Batineh coast between Khor Kalba and Dibba is recognised to he subject to the Sheikh of Sharjah, one of the “ Tvueial Chiefs ” (see p. 14). ° Ras-al-Khaima is, properly speaking, the N.E. limit of the Jowasmi tribes, but the Shihooh tribesmen in the villages betweeh Ras-al-Khaima and Bokha acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of the former place. The main body of the Shihooh tribe (to the N. and E. of Bokha) is subject to the Sultan of Oman. t The expedition of 1819 against the Jowasmi pirates resulted in the General treaty of 1820, by which the Arabs bound themselves to abandon piracy. This treaty was replaced by the “ Maritime Truce ” of 1835, by which the Arabs were precluded from engaging in hostilities at sea, on the understanding that Great Britain would not interfere Avith their wars by land. This truce, originally renewable every six months, was made perpetual in 1853. It is strictly enforced at the present day./ r EL WAKRA TO DUIIAT MUSALAMIYA. 19 CDAST FROM AL WAKRA TO DUHAT MUSALAMIYA.

No description available. Al Kntif. —A1 Katif is a large town* on the coast about miles N N.W. of Anich and about 35 miles N.W. of Bahrein Harbour. It appears to be the Turkish headquarters for this section of the Persian Gulf coast. Al Katif can be reached by boats drawing not more than 6 to 7 feet. There is plenty ot fresh water in the neighbourhood in springs, and supplies of vegetables, &amp;c., can be obtained. The defences are as follows :— (a) Laro-e fort in the town containing the residence of the sheikh and accommodation for the Turkish garrison. In the N.W. corner of the fort is a citadel said to have been built by the Portuguese. There is a minaret in the S. part of the fort. (5) Fort Tarut, on the K. side of Tarut Island, among the date trees. The high towers show above the trees, and are visible 10 to 11 miles. (c) Fort Darin, a square work at the S. point of Tarut Island. Tarut Island is about 3| miles in diameter. The strength of the garrison is not known. In the autumn of 1902 the Zufiaf brought 350f infantry and two small guns from Basra. The troops and guns were landed at the dilapidated fort of Anieh. One hundred of the infantry were sent to Al Ojatr, and the two guns were despatched to FI Hassa (about 70 miles to the S. of Al Katif). Twenty-five soldiers were to lie stationed on the island of Musalamiya and J anna, some 68 miles N.W. of Al Katif. Curzon’s map of 1891 shows a road to Koweit from Al Ivatif, and two roads to the Nejd district (but see Map 2 in Pocket). Janna and Musalamiya Islands. — These two islands, some 68 miles N.W. of Al Katif, are stated to bejunder the sheikh of Al Katif and, as mentioned above, were to iTe held by 25 Turkish soldiers detached from that place. The sheikh of Koweit asserts that Musalamiya belongs to his territory, but his claim is believed to be untenable. On the N. side of Janna Island is a small fort in which the Turkish garrison would probably be quartered. ° From 5.000 to 6.000 tons of dates are exported annually during the last quarter of the year from Al Katif and Al Ojair to Indian ports, t According to another account, 230 men.BAHREIN ISLANDS. 21 BAHREIN (or BAHRAIN) ISLANDS.

Bahrein Harbour lies between the icefs N.W. of A1 Manama — JMuharrak. The safe limit of draught for vessels using the harbour is stated by the “ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898, to be 19 feet. Landing at A1 Manama is inconvenient, except at high water, there being no wharves or piers.* Boats cannot get within a quarter of a mile of the beach at low-water. There is no information as to landing at Muharrak. No repairing No ironwork repairs can be effected. A large number of native craft belong to Bahrein, and material for ship-building is imported, so presumably wooden vessels can be repaired. Supplies. Coal. — No coal can be obtained. Water.- Water is plentiful and of good quality, there being numerous springs in the X. part of Bahrein Island. The sources mentioned as being in the vicinity of Bahrein Harbour are— (1.)

(See Admiralty Charts 22 , 3285,* 3293,* and 2837b ; also Map 2 in pocket.) T he town of Ivoiveit is the chief place of the territory subject to the Sheikh of Koweit on the N.W. shore of the Persian Gulf. It is situated on the S. side of Koweit Harbour (Avhich is also known as “ Grane ” or the Horn), and extends for about 1 mile along the shore. The toAvn is for the most part well built and presents a cleanly appearance, in great contrast to other Gulf ports. In 1902 the population Avas estimated to be about 12,000, but it is largely increased at times by visiting Bedawin tribes which form encampments outside the toAvn Avails. The district around Koweit is unproductive, but the toAvn has an extensive transit trade of Avhich no returns are available. The exports are chiefly dates and horses ; the imports timber, rice, and arms. In 1898, 130 vessels of from 20 to 300 tons belonged to the port and took a considerable share in the trade of the Gulf. The Sheikh of Koweit is nominally a Turkish subject, but is practically independent of Turkish control.Passage distances. Harbour. Natural basin. Repairing facilities for native craft.

The N. part of the entrance is barred by Failaka Island and extensive mud flats. The navigable channel, about 3 miles in Avidth, passes close to the S. shore. The harbour W. of Has Ascheirij is called Duhat Kathama. According to a special report made in 1900, the harbour is capable of accommodating a large number of ships draAving 24 feet, and “ is the only one in the N. part of the Gulf Avhere vessels of this size can get safe and sheltered anchorage.”* The best anchorage Avas stated to be in Duhat Kathama, Avhich is well sheltered from the Shamal. Consideiable interest attaches to the N. shore of Duhat Kathama as a proposed site of the terminus of the projected railway through Asia Minor to the Persian Gulf (see p. 75). If the terminus is placed here, it is considered that long and extensive piers Avill be necessary for loading and discharging cargo. Close to the S. shore, about 4 miles S.W. of the toAvn, is Bandar-ash-ShuAvaik, shoAvn on Chart 22 as “ basin Avhere native boats are laid up.” In 1901 this basin and the approach to it were carefully examined, and it was considered that the “ Sphinx ” could safely pass the channel any time above half-tide, and could lie in the basin at any tide. According to the “ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898, this basin is quite sheltered. Substantial breakAvaters of loose stone extend along the Avhole sea front of the town—over a mile in length. The space betAveen them and the shore can be conA r erted into docks by building up the various entrances through the breakAvaters, which is stated to be an operation of no great difficulty. In this manner it is understood that vessels of several hundred tons can be clocked and o\ T erhauled. Coal. —There is no coal. Water. —Water is obtained from the following sources :— (1.) Scattered Avells S.W. of the toAvn, and distant 4,000 to 5,000 yards E.N.E. from the natural basin called ° I n this connection note that Umkasr has great possibilities (see p. 29).KOWtflT. 25 Bandar-asli-Shuwaik.

The distance from Koweit to Basra is about four days’ march. Curzon’s map of 1891 shows a “road ” leading S. from Koweit town to A1 Ivatif [see p. 20), but it has not been mentioned in late reports {see, however, Map 2 in Pocket). There is no regular steamer communication, and no telegraph. Tn 1898 the town of Koweit was surrounded by alow wall with Defences, towers in a ruinous state; a report made in December 1901, however, described the town as unwalled. According to the “ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898, S.E. of the town, between Ras-al-Ajuza and Raa-al-Arz, were three small forts, near the coast. Beyond and in the neighbourhood of Ras-al-Arz there were in 1898 three “ forts,” as follows :— ( 1 .) About 1,300 yards S.W. of Ras-al-Arz. ( 2 .) About 3 miles S.W. of the point. (3.) About 5£ miles S.W. of the point. A small hill fort 180 feet above the sea. One of the above (it is not clear which) was pulled down in 1900 and a new one constructed in its place. It was visited in 1901 and was reported to be of no value for coast defence, as it could easily be destroyed by a ship’s heavy guns. It appeared to be intended mainly for defence against hostile Arabs. The work is quadrilateral in shape with a tower at each angle. The interior is divided into two parts by a wall. In 1901 no guns were mounted, but the Sheikh of Koweit stated that he hoped shortly to place there two machine guns which he had arranged to obtain. In 1898, there were the following small works : (1) at Fa- Coast naitis, 10 miles S. of Ras-al-Arz; (2) at Abu Halaifa. 3 miles “forts” S. of S. of Fanaitis; and (3) at Shiaiba, 5£ miles S. of Abu Halaifa ; Ras-al-Aiz. all (it is understood) in Koweit territory.Jehara fort. / 2C) PERSIAN GULF. -RESOURCES AND DEFENCES.

In any case, the works appear to be of no importance. The “fort” at Jehara, 17 miles W. of Koweit, is a square work with towers at the angles, and is stated to command the wells 1,900 yards N.W. of it. Between the fort and the wells are two large walled gardens. In 1901 no guns were mounted in the fort, but it was stated that two light guns might be placed here with advantage to cover the wells. Note on the Defence of Koweit. —A summary of a scheme for the defence of Koweit from land attack will be found in the Appendix (p. 78). Details of a project said to have been drawn up by the Turkish military authorities for the defence of Koweit and the Khor Abdalla will be found in the Appendix (p. 82). Note'on Koweit Affairs (see 2 in Pocket).—For several years past there have been intermittent hostilities between the Sheikh of Koweit and his powerful neighbour the Emir of Nejd, which have caused friction between the British and Turkish Governments. The following are the chief parties concerned :— Mularuk* Sheikh of Koweit, who acknowledges Turkish sovereignty, but is independent of Turkish control. Abdul Aziz Jbn (or es) Raschid (or Rcshid), Emir of Nejd (an extensive inland district, W. and S. of Koweit), who for his own purposes acknowledges Turkish sovereignty and control. The Emir is bitterly hostile to the Sheikh of Koweit, chiefly on account of the shelter afforded by the latter to the Emir’s rival, viz.:— Abdurrahman Feysal bin Saoad, relative and enemy of the Emir of Nejd and claimant to his territory—a friend of Mubaruk, who has given him shelter at Koweit. Abdul Aziz bin Abdurrahman ibn Saoud, son of the last- named ; finally, The Turkish Government, which desires to establish control over Koweit, and, therefore, favours the Emir of Nejd as a useful means to this end ; and The British Government, which, by reason of its interests in the Persian Gulf, is desirous of maintaining the status quo, and therefore has upheld the Sheikh of Koweit. * 1 he events of the last few years have shown that this astute chieftain is capable of doing anything to further his own interests, and that the utmost caution is necessary in dealing with him.KUWAIT— K HOR A BD ALL A H. 27 * Issued for Fleet purposes, 2 June 1902. (It may be noted that the international interest in Koweit arose from the fact that a site was chosen on the shore of Koweit Harbour for a terminus of the projected railway through Asia Mmor to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf Appendix? p. 75 ). Ibis interest has been lately somewhat diminished by the discovery that Umkasr (see p. 29) has greater natural advantages for such a terminus. It is, indeed, asserted by the Sheikh of Koweit that Umkasr lies within his territory, but the claim rests on doubtful evidence). A number of fights have taken place between the Koweit and JNejd forces with varying results. Koweit has several times been threatened with attacks, but, thanks to British support, nothing came of them, and the semi-independent status of the Sheikh of Koweit has been maintained. in May 1902, the town of Iliadh (capital of S. Nejd), was captured and the southern half of Nejd occupied by Abdul Aziz bin Abdurrahman, with disaffected Nejd tribesmen, on behalf of Ins father Abdurrahman Feysal bin Saoud, who then left Koweit with a considerable following and joined his son at Kiadh. 1 he situation there does not appear to have altered materially up to the present (March 1903). Probably, therefore, thehrmrot Nejd will be unable to devote much 'attention to Koweit for some time to come. KHOR ABDALLA (or ABDULLAH). (See Admiralty Charts 1,235, 3,293,* and 2,837b.) Khor Abdalla is a deep inlet, lying between Bubiyan Island and the mainland W. of the Shatt-el-Arab. ^ miles wide at the entrance between Ras-al-Geit (Bubiyan Island), and the promontory S. of Fao.

It is stated that a scheme has been drawn up by the Turkish military authorities for the defence of the Khor Abdalla. (h’ce Appendix, p. 82.) BUBIYAN (or BUBIAN) ISLAND. (See Admiralty Charts 3,293,* 1,235, and 2,837b.) Bubiyan Island, on the W. side of the Khor Abdalla, is about 25 miles long (N. and S.), by 12 miles broad. The narrow Khor Sabiya (see p. 30) separates the island from the mainland. Bubiyan is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, and it is stated that Koweit fishermen, who cultivate ground on the island for a part of the year, pay rent to Koweit merchants. There is no permanent population. At the beginning of 1902, a Turkish post was established on the narrow peninsula Ilas-al-Geit, on the E. coast of Bubiyan. In February 1902, 1 officer and 20 Turkish soldiers, detached from Umkasr (see p. 29), were in camp here, and it was under stood that the post was to be permanent. A brick house for stores, &amp;c., was being constructed. The detachment was reduced to 10 soldiers during the summer of 1902, probably for the duration of the hot season. Apparently there was no natural water supply in February 1902, and water as well as all other supplies had to be brought from Fao in two dhows. Note .-—The claim of the Sheikh of Koweit to Bubiyan being disputed by the Turks, it is possible that the detachment may only be intended to show Turkish occupation, and that Ras-al- Geit is the most convenient place for communication with Fao (about 30 miles by dhow), and for the withdrawal of the detach ment if attacked by Koweit tribesmen. It might, however, be supposed that a post on the N. shore, within reach of the garrison at Umkasr, would be preferable if it were merely desired to fly the Turkish flag.BUBIYAN CMKA8R AND ADJACENT WATERWAYS. 29 * It seems possible that Ilas-al-Geit may appear to the Turkish nuthonties a suitable site for one of the two heavy batteries vtuch, it is stated, have been proposed for the E. shore of .oiibiyan as part of the defences for the Khor Abdalla.

At the head of this deep inlet (and N. of Bubiyan Island) is Warba Island, which is 7 miles long, roughly N.E. and S.W. There are channels N. and S. of this island which were examined in February 1902. Channel N. of Warba Island, and Khor Umkasr. I he channel N. of Warba Island would be available for vessels of any draught but for an obstruction off the E. end of Warba Island over which the channel is narrow. At this point there is, however, at least 18 feet at high water and probably more, and in February 1902 it was considered that this shallow part might be dredged if necessary. At about 7 miles from the E. end of Warba Island the channel is joined by the Khor Umkasr. The lower part of the Khor Umkasr is a broad and deep waterway running roughly N.W. and S.E., and the shallow upper part is understood to extend into the interior at times nearly as far as Rafdieh, 6 miles short of Zobeir (about 30 miles N.W. of Umkasr). There is good accommodation for ships close to the shore near the point marked “good landing” on Chart 3,293f. Umkasr. Lmkasr is situated about 4 miles up the Khor Umkasr on the W. shore. For distances, see under Khor Abdalla. Distances. Apparently there is no town at present, and the site is only marked by the enclosure occupied by the Turkish garrison. Umkasr and the surrounding country are claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, on somewhat doubtful evidence. In February 1902 there was a camp of Koweit tribesmen 2 £ miles from the Turkish camp. The Turkish camp in February 1902 was about 2 miles N.W.

During the summer of 1902 the detach ment appears to have been slightly reduced, but the strength, no doubt, depends on the necessities of the moment. In February 1902 the water supply was stated to be good. In 1903 it was stated that brackish water could be found anywhere in the vicinity at a depth of 4 to 5 feet. There is no information as to other supplies. There is grazing ground for sheep but not for horses. Safwan (or Sefwan) is about 20 miles, and Zobeir about 30 miles, N.W. of Umkasr. From Zobeir to Basra the distance is about 10 miles. Keinforcements, &amp;c. for Umkasr come from Basra via Zobeir and Safwan, which are both held by Turkish garrisons. t'For strength, .sec under Basra p. 36.) The direct road or track joining Zobeir and Umkasr is smooth and firm. Caravans, however, prefer the W. route via Safwan owing to the numerous wells. Channel S. of Warba Island, and Khor Sabiya. The channel S. of Warba Island passes clear of the bar which limits the draught of vessels using the N. channel. It was found to have great natural advantages for a portf at a point off the S.W. end of Warba Island. For distances, see under Khor Abdalla. The deep water channel at this point is rather narrow, but has good anchorage for the largest ships, and is quite landlocked. If the channel were dredged on each side a very fine harbour might be made. It will be seen from Chart 3,293 that the narrow channel between Warba Island and the mainland, which connects this waterway with the Khor Umkasr, can only be used by boats. The continuation of the waterway to the 9. passes between Bubiyan Island and the mainland, and is known as the Khor Sabiya. In February 1902 the ‘‘Sphinx” proceeded down this channel to a point 6 miles N. of Sabiya village. Sabiya was found to consist of a few mud walls and date trees. It is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit, and in February 1902 was occupied temporarily by his tribesmen. Sabiya is about 10 hours’ march from Koweit. ° According to a report of 1903, this work has been abandoned, and the garrison is now quartered close by in a small rectangular enclosure surrounded by a loop-holed mud wall with a banquette. It is about a quarter of a mile from the edge of the creek. The creek at this point is not more than 3 or 4 feet deep at high water. | See note as to site for railway terminus, p. 31.UMKASR, ETC.—SHATT-AL-ARAB. 31 . , W ^ S r,,mou red in the summer of 1902 that the Turks w C&lt; J u occu Py Sabiya and Arafajiya,a village about 5 miles iN.

Has Sabiya, on the YV. side of the entrance, is one of the points mentioned in the rumoured Turkish Defence Scheme for Koweit and vicinity (see Appendix, p. 82). Noic on the Suitability of Umkasr as a Railway Terminus — It was originally proposed to place the terminus of the projected railway through Asia Minor to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf (see Appendix, p. 75) on the shores of Koweit Harbour. The acquisition of a site there presenting difficulties, Umkasr has been proposed as an alternative terminus. The examination of the waterways in the vicinity of Umkasr made by the “ Sphinx ” in February 1902 showed that there are two possible sites :— ( 1 ) on the W. shore of Khor Umkasr close to point marked “ good landing ” on Chart 3,293 ; ( 2 ) on the W. shore of the natural harbour off the S.W. end of Warba Island. The natural advantages of ( 2 ) were considered to make it far supei 101 to Koweit a.s a site for a railway terminus, and it is more accessible than ( 1 ). The selection of either ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) as a terminus would necessitate an accurate survey of the Khor Abdalla and the laying down of buoys in that inlet. SHATT-AL (EL or UL) -ARAB, (See Admiralty Charts 1,235 and 2,837b.) This large river flows into the Persian Gulf at its N.YV. extreme.

The two British steamers (belonging to Messrs. Lynch) running between Basra and Baghdad were in 1898 of the American river type with disconnecting engines. The larger one was 230 feet long by 45 feet broad across the paddle boxes. Native boats of about 30 tons with 15 hands take 30 to 40 days in tracking from Basra to Baghdad. Note .—The Shatt-al-Arab may become a trade route of the first importance. The Turkish confluents traverse fertile provinces which, only require cheap transport and good government for the proper development of their trade. At presents the channels are slowly silting up, so that nothing but shallow draught vessels can ply on the upper waters, and the Government only allows two foreign steamers (viz., those of Messrs. Lynch) to trade between Basra and Baghdad. The Persian confluent, the Karun River, which joins the Shatt-al-Arab near Mohammerah, gives access to some of the chief trading centres of West Persia. Great importance is attached to the development of this route for British trade, and there appears to be some prospect of progress. (See p. 41.)F AO. 33 FAQ. (See Admiralty Charts 1,235 and 2,837b.)

Fao Fort.* Fao Fort is situated on the W. bank of the Shatt-al-Arab just inside the entrance. It is about 4,600 yards from the “ inner bar buoy,” and 6,400 yards S.E. of the telegraph station. It is a closed work in the shape of a blunted redan (but nearly rectangular) facing approximately S.E. The fort had been partially constructed by 1888._ In 1889 it was reported that the S.E. face (about 180 jaids in length) consisted of a curtain, flanked by two bastions, and faced with white sandstone brought from Koweit; the whole showing some 15 feet above the bank which formed the counterscarp of the ditch. In the curtain were two open gun emplacements, to^ he protected by iron shields, separated by a central traverse. I he emplacements at the time were loosely bricked up. The bastions appeared to contain casemates, magazines, &lt;kc., judging by the ventilators visible above them. (Ihis face commands the bar of the river and its approach.) The N.E., or river face (about 160 yards in length), was of similar construction, but somewhat lighter, and the curtain and left bastion were some 4 feet lower than the S.E. lace, which, therefore, acted as a traverse to it from fire from seaward. There were three openings in the curtain, probably intended to be embrasures. (This face fires across the river, and vessels must pass within 3,000 yards of it.) The S.W. face was exactly similar to the river face. The gorge (about 250 yards long) consisted of a stone 1 curtain, containing casemate accommodation for the garrison, | with a gateway in the centre protected by a small caponnier. A shallow wet ditch, some 30 yards wide, surrounded the \ work, and was crossed by a bridge at the gorge. r A bank some 4 feet high and 6 ^ feet thick, formed the t counterscarp of the ditch on the three faces, but not on the side of the gorge. Its interior slope was revetted with brick. s There was a small group of mud huts or temporary barracks g outside the gorge of the work. On the river side was a small landing quay for material, &amp;c. A small creek ran at right angles to the river from 100 to v 300 feet in rear of the gorge, beyond which were date plan tations, which, together with some reclaimed ground S.W. and S. of the fort, were capable of being inundated at spring tides. No armament was mounted. ° Sec Plan, p. 74, of Plans and Sketches attached to Turkey Coast De- ^ fences, No. 458.

According to the “ Internationale Revue,” &amp;c., of July 1902, the Turks have drawn up a scheme for the defence of Ivoweit and vicinity, which concludes the reconstruction of the two existing batteries at Fao and the provision of outlying batteiies (see Appendix, p. 82). The existing garrison of 65 would be inprpnspd to three companies pf in-fant.rv and the necessary artillery for the guns. Note.

Exclusive of the river steamers above Rasra, 131 steamers entered and cleared from the port.* Rasra is the trade-gate of Mesopotamia, and (for the present) of a portion of West Persia. The construction of the proposed railway from Asia Minor via Rasra to the Persian Gulf.should cause a great increase of trade at Rasra, which, as the meeting point of*'fluvial and sea traftie, would presumably hold its own against any railway terminus near the mouth of the Shatt- al-Arab. &gt; .

Telegraph .—There are land lines ( 1 ) to the cable station at Fao, and ( 2 ) to Baghdad, &amp;c. (for the interior and Europe). According to the “ Levant Herald,” of 21 st February 1901, the Turkish Government had resolved to establish a telegraph line between Basra and the Nejd district.

Garrison. There are no modern defences at Basra. The town is partially walled in. The normal garrison consisted in 1896 of two battalions of # o infantry. During 1 the last few years large numbers of troops have been concentrated from time to time at Basra, in connection with the disturbances in the neighbourhood of Koweit. In March 1902, the following troops were stationed at Basra and outstations :— Basra and Zobeir (10 miles distant) : 1,500 infantry, 1 battery field artillery, 300 cavalry (on mules) ,100 Sappers, &amp;c. Detached from Zobeir to Safwan, Umkasr, and Bubiyan island (see pp. 28, 29, and 30) :— 350 infantry, 50 cavalry. At that time it was thought that the number of troops might be increased and two more posts established (presumably at Sabiya and Arafajiya) (see p. 31). During the summer of 1902 the garrisons at Safwan, Umkasr, and Bubiyan island, were reduced to 60 at the two former, and 10 at the latter. Note .—The Pashalik of Basra forms part of the Vilayet of Baghdad. Baghdad is the military centre and is the headquarters of the 11 th Division ( 6 th Urdu), which consists of 17 battalions, 15 squadrons, 16 batteries of field artillery, and 3 batteries of mountain artillery.IIA FAR CHANNEL—M OH A 31M ERA II. 39 PERSIAN TERRITORY. HAFAR CHANNEL. (See Admiralty Chart 1,235.) The entrance of the Hafar Channel is on the E. side of the Shatt-al-Arab, 45 miles above the bar. The channel forms the connecting link between the Shatt-al- Arab and the Kanin Kiver and for practical purposes is the mouth of the latter river.* The length of the channel is about 2 miles, and the width about 400 yards. The depth is stated to be from 3 to 4 fathoms. For further particulars see under Mohammerah. MOHAMMERAH (MUHAMMERA.) {See Admiralty Charts 1,235 with inset, and 2,837 b.) Mohammerah is situated in Persian territory on the N. bank of the Hafar channel, about 1 mile from the Shatt-al-Arab. The population in 1895 was about 5,600. In 1901, the value of the exports was 215,556/., of the imports 232,835/.; and 126 steamers entered the port.f The trade is increasing. The Sheikh of Mohammerah, as the head of the powerful neigh bouring tribes, is a personage of importance, which, in the case C of the present Sheikh, has been considerably enhanced politically by his marriage with a Persian royal princess. Nominally subject to the Persian Governor of Shuster, he is virtually independent of that official. He is the nominal head of the Customs at Mohammerah, under the Persian Government. A British Consul is stationed at Mohammerah. The approximate distance of Mohammerah from— The bar of the Shatt al-Arab - Fao Basra - - - - Ahwaz (Bunder-Nasri) Bund-i-Kir - - - Shuster - - - is 46 41 19 117 157 182 miles.

It is very shallow. f In 1902, 133 steamers (135,436 tons) and 130 sailing vessels (total tonnage unknown) entered the port. For this year the trade figures for Mohammerah and the Karun ports are grouped together:—Exports, 179,612/. ; imports, 123,458/. Trade was abnormally depressed.40 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Anchorage, &amp;c. No repairing facilities. Supplies. Communica tions. Old defences. Vessels can lie off the town in the Hafar channel, close to the bank, but, there being no room to swing, they generally anchor near the mouth of the channel. There is no information as to landing places. It is understood that there are no facilities for repairs. Coal .—There is no information as to coal. Water .— There is no information as to wells. The water in the Hafar channel, as in the Shatt-al-Arab, is fresh, and it is both cooler and purer than the water of the latter river. Food .—A few supplies can be obtained in the bazaar at Mo- hammerah. The surrounding country would appear to be capable of furnishing large food supplies if required. Hoads .—On Lord Curzon’s map of 1891, a road is shown run ning from Mohammerah to the E., connecting with a road which follows the E. bank of the Karun River to Ahwaz, Shuster, Dizful, Ac. Steamers .—Bucknall Bros, and the Anglo-Arabian Steam Navigation Co.’s steamers call regularly. A steamer of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Co. (Messrs. Lynch) plies fortnightly between Mohammerah and Ahwaz. Telegraph .—A telegraph line connects Mohammerah with Ahwaz, following roughly the W. bank of the Karun. It may be noted that the Turkish land line connecting Fao with Basra follows the W. bank of the Shatt-al-Arab* and passes close to Mohammerah. It is believed that there is no connection between the Persian and Turkish lines at present. There were originally three mud batteries at the mouth of the Hafar channel, viz., one on each of the points flanking the en trance and one on the N. shore, a few hundred yards higher up the channel, close to where the British Consulate now stands. The batteries were bombarded and reduced to ruins by the British in 1857, and at the present day only the remains of the south battery are visible, the site being used as a quarantine station. Saluting According to a press account in 1902 the Sheikh of Moham- battery. merah has four guns under a canopy at Feilieh, 1 mile up the Shatt-al-Arab (? identical with Fahliyah on Chart 1,235) which are used for saluting purposes, and always return the salutes of mail steamers.* The size of the guns is not known. Steamers, &lt; 6 c. According to the same press account the Sheikh has two river steamers, and also steam launches moored off “ Feilieh.” It is not stated whether these are armed. Armed According to the same account the “ Sheikh’s people ” are natives. plentitully supplied with Martinis—the tribes, mainly Arab, are very independent of Persian rule, and never more united than now ( 1902 ) under the Sheikh. 1 1 he same account states that the residence of the Sheikh is at Feilieh, whilst the residence of bis Persian princess, an imposing building, lies a little higher up the river.Mo HAMMER All—KARUN rflVER. 41 There is no information as to the barracks shown on Chart Barmri,. 1,2,15 C - of the 1 ,Jaranlln e station on the S. side of the channel k “' on^ 6 &lt; thMW?? 8 ? 7 r n WaS iTo arded a British madron on 20 th March 18o7 (during the Persian war), and captured by the troops of tlie expedition.

KARUN RIVER. (See Admiralty Chart 1,235.) 1 he Hafar ( hannel meets the Karun River about 1 mile E of Mohammerah. As already explained (footnote, p. 39 ) the Bah- rmshir River, which flows roughly parallel to the Shatt-al-Arab is supposed to be the lower course of the Karun River ; but bein^ very shallow, all traffic between the Karun River and the Persian Cult passes through the Hafar Channel and Shatt-al-Arab. From Mohammerah to Ahwaz (Bunder Nasri), a distance of Navigation lii miles, the Karun is navigable for vessels of about 24 feet draught from August to November, and 4 ^ to 5 feet draught when the river is high. &amp; 1 or this distance the river averages 400 yards in width the channel being tortuous. The strength of the current varies from 2 to 5 knots an hour, according to the season. A steamer of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch) plies fortnightly between Moham- merah and Ahwaz. Just below Ahwaz there are rapids for It miles, which obstruct navigation. Cargo is transported from steamers below the rapids to others above and vice versa. Above Ahwaz the river is navigable for 40 miles to Bund-i-kir which is at the junction of its three branches, the Diz, Shatail and Gergar. Hie chief traffic above Bund-i-kir is on the Shatail for about 18 miles, navigation ceasing at a point about 7 miles below Shuster. Between Ahwaz and this point goods, &amp;c., are carried by the steamer “ Shushan ” belonging to Messrs. Lynch. The “Shushan” can pass Ahwaz Rapids (last time reported, March 1902). In about 1842 Selby took Layard in the gunboat “Assvria” across Ahwaz rapids, and close up to Shuster. 1 he city of Dizful, on the Diz River, can be approached within 10 miles when the river is full in winter and spring.42 Passage distances. Resources. Communica tions. I PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Note. —Owing to the absence of railways in South Persia, and the prohibitive charges for transport on the caravan routes from the various ports, the greater part of the interior is almost inaccessible to British trade. In the west, however, the Karun, the sole navigable river of S. Persia, forms the approach to valuable provinces, and it is easy to understand the importance which is attached to the development of this river as a trade route. {See Appendix, p. 84.) AHWAZ AND BUNDER NASRI. {See Admiralty Charts 1,235 and 2,837 b.) Ahwaz is situated on the E. bank of the Karun River at the upper end of the rapids {see p. 41). It is stated to have about 7,000 inhabitants. Bunder Nasri is the new commercial village on the same bank just below the rapids, and is the terminus for the steamers on the lower river. In 1901 the value of the exports was 69,543/., of the imports 72,358/.* The approximate distance of Ahwaz from— Mohammerah (by river) is 117 miles. „ (by road) is about 85 miles.

The E. branch retains the name of Musa lor about 17 miles, when it in turn divides into two branches, viz., hhor Mashur and Khor Dorak. The W. branch is called Khor Bukhader, and extends to a point close to the course of the Karun River. The Khor Musa has only recently been explored, and as yet few details have been received * It appears, however, that a defensdile naval station could perfectly well be established on the Khor. Ihere is plenty of water, and the approach from the sea would be difficult to an enemy. The surrounding country is fertile and populous, and its generally level nature would facilitate railway construction. I he anchorages used by the “ Sphinx ” during a visit in 1903 are marked by anchors on Map 1. DILAM. (See Admiralty Chart 2,837b and Map 1 in Pocket.) According to a report of June 1903 the seaport of Dilam, situated about 58 miles E. of the entrance to Khor Musa, is in telegraphic communication with Bushire by an overland wire. Dilam lias about 1,000 inhabitants. Considerable quantities of grain are exported. KHARAG ISLAND. (See Admiralty Chart 2,837b, and inset.) Kharng Island is about 30 miles W.N.W. of Bushire, and is under the governor of that town. It is 4 miles long (N. and S.) by about 2 miles broad. The highest point is 284 feet above the sea. The only place of interest is the village at the N.E. point, which contains about 400 men, mostly fishermen. For distances sec under Bushire, p. 44.

BUSHIRE (ABU SHAHR or ABU SHEHR). {Sec Admiralty Charts 27 and 2,837n, with inset). Bushire is the principal sea-port of Persia and occupies the low N. end of an extensive peninsula. The town extends for half-a-mile from the point. The streets are narrow and dirty, and the houses poorly built of inferior stone. In 1898 the population was stated to be about 15,000 (chiefly Arabs and Persians).

In 1898, however (according to the “Persian Gulf Pilot”), there were no wharves or piers, but there was a landing place at the embankment on the E. side of the town. According to a press account (1902), a visitor stated that cargo can be brought alongside the Custom House (presumably on the embankment mentioned above), in boats in almost any weather, provided that the boats can get out to the steamers. It is understood that there are no facilities for repairs. Coal .—There is no coal for sale. The British Government keep a stock sufficient for 2 | years (average consumption) for the Koyal Navy. It is stored in sheds on the embankment of the creek, and is sent off to ships by lighters. According to a consular report for 1900, the lighterage for general purposes was very limited, and it was believed that the customs authorities were negotiating for the formation of a private steam barge company. No repairing facilities. Supplies. Water .—There is no water in the town. It has to be brought from wells outside. Water is found 12 feet down all over the plain S. of the town. Ships can obtain water from the well near the date trees, half-mile S. of lias ash Shaghab (a little over 4 miles S. of the town).

To avoid skirting the S. side of Bushire Harbour, passengers and goods for the interior are frequently shipped to Shif on°the N.E. side, opposite the N. end of Sheikh Saad Island. This saves a tedious journey by land of about 29 miles. The passage to Shif, however, appears to be not without disadvantages, as the following extract from a traveller’s letter (Press, October 1902), shows:— “ Ihe boat had to be dragged and pushed over a mile of semi-liquicl mud before we could land at Shif ; here we found the mules.” 1 he traffic between Bushire and Shif is carried on by the inhabitants of the village at the N. point of Sheikh Saad Island, who possess many large boats. RISHAHR (or RESHIREX {See Admiralty Charts 27 and 2,837b (with inset).) Kishahr Point is about 5 miles S. of Bushire. The old fort and the village of Kishahr (or Reshire) are about 1,200 yards E.S.E. of the point.

HALILA. (See Admiralty Chart 2,837b, (with inset).) Has Halila is about 6 miles S.S.E. of Rishahr Point and 11 miles from Busbire. Halila village, with a large square tower, is two-thirds of a mile N.N.W. of Has Halila, and contains about 100 men who carry on some cultivation. For distances. See under Busbire (p. 44). The best landing is presumably on the beach, mentioned by the “ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898, in connection with the position of the wells, 1 mile E. of Has Haiila. Good water can be obtained from wells about 1 mile E. of Has Halila and 80 yards from the beach. The water is only 3 feet from the surface, and is better than any procurable near Bushire for shipping. There are clumps of date trees close W. of the wells, extend ing across the peninsula. Note. —At the commencement of the Persian War of 1856-7, General Havelock landed with the British force at “ Halila Bay,” on 7 th December 1856. He moved N. along the coast, and, in conjunction with the fleet, attacked and took Reshire Fort after severe fighting on 8 th December. The advance was then continued to Bushire, which surrendered on 10 th December. LINGA(H). (See Admiralty Charts 753 and 2,837a.)

Kishm Island lies at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, close to the Persian shore. Its length is 60 miles roughly E. and W. The breadth varies from 6 to 19 miles. The surface ot the interior is very irregular. The island is separated from the Persian coast by Clarence Strait, which is from 1 to 7 miles wide. The chief places of interest on the island are Bassidu at the W. end, and Kishm Town at the E. end, both described later. Kishm Island, generally speaking, is fairly well oft for water. It is stated that naphtha is found on the island. Note. In 1852 Kishm Island was taken by Persia from the Sultan’of Oman (Maskat), but reverted to the latter again in 1855 on lease. . . i • • In 1868 the lease was forcibly terminated by 1 ersia, since which time the island has remained Persian territory. At present the government is administered by the Sheikh of Kishm (Town), under the nominal superintendence of the Persian Oovernor of Bunder Abbas (on the mainland). BASSIDU (BASIDU or BASSIDOREC (iS'f’c Admiralty Charts 35, 753, and 2,837 a.) Bassidu is the name of the British concession at the extreme N.W. point of Kishm Island. The land was originally granted to the British Government by the Sultan of Oman (Maskat) in 1820. During the various changes of Governmentf to which, since that time, the Island of Kishm has been subject, the British concession has held good. After the British expedition of 1819, the troops, at first stationed near Kishm Town, and afterwards at Salak Point (opposite Henjam Island), were transferred to Bassidu in 1821, and remained two years. A garrison was maintained at Bassidu up to 1883. Bassidu was a station for the Indian Marine up to 1879. At present British authority is represented by a native agent. The boundary of the British concession is not exactly defined. ° A report of June 1903 states that the anchorage off Laft Point in the centre of the Strait forms a good harbour for the largest ships, and is thoroughly well protected from all winds. It could easily be defended from attack. t See Note under Kishm Island.BASS I DU. 51 1 ending delimitation, British jurisdiction is provisionally restricted to the elevated ground, the S. boundary of which is faintly outhned on Admira'ty Chart 35, immediately S. of the word “ Bassidu.

It was falling into ruin in 1900, and was considered hardly worth repair, as the sea is undermining the cliff'on which it stands. (2.) A ruined bungalow similar in plan to “ Major Smith’s ” house is situated ± mile S.W. The flagstaff from which the British flag is habitually flown is close to this building. (3.) The workshop in 1900 was roofless. It contained only an old turning lathe and the remains of a forge. D 252 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Rifle range. Supplies. Communica tions. No defences.

It consists of five small rooms and a verandah with a kitchen attached. The native Agent lives in private quarters about £ mile from the flagstaff and jetty. There is a rifle range (length 600 yards) which is used by vessels of the East Indian Squadron employed in the Persian Gulf. Coal .—There is no coal supply at present. Water .—There are three Government birkas (reservoirs) for rain water, each measuring 60 feet by 8 feet and 16 feet deep. In 1902, according to a Press account, these reservoirs were in very good repair. The supply of good water is limited. When the reservoirs are empty water has to be brought from Nakhli- stan (Old Bassidore), nearly 2 miles distant, and in this case vessels are advised by the “Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898, that water is more quickly obtainable at Linga (Persian coast) or some other port. Food .—A few provisions and necessaries are procurable. There is no information as to roads, and at present there is neither steamer nor telegraphic communication. The nearest cable station is Jashk. It has been proposed to connect Bassidu by a T-pi ece with one of the cables Jashk-Bushire, and to prolong this through Clarence Strait to Bunder Abbas. (See also under Henjam Island, pp. 55 and 56, for another proposal.) There are no defences. Apparently no traces can be found of the former Portuguese fort which is supposed to have been at “ Kalat Haji Karim” (? Kalat Hajji Karitu), E. of the provisional boundary. According to a special report made in 1900, there is very good harbour accommodation at Bassidu for vessels drawing not more than 16 feet, and the anchorage is well sheltered by surrounding shoals. Bassidu would be unsuitable as a naval station except for small ships,* and it is inconveniently far from the entrance of the Gulf for purposes of observation and control. The place could be defended by forts built on the land side and on outlying shoals. Remarks .—Bassidu was the headquarters of the (troops and) ships after the expedition of 1819 and remained a station for the Indian Marine up to 1879. It is reasonable to infer from the continued use of Bassidu for 60 years that it was not without natural advantages as a naval station. T he discovery of the deeper approach to the anchorage would probably modify this opinion.KISHM TOWN. 53 KISHM TOWN. {Sec Admiralty Charts 2,837a (with inset) and 753.) Kishm Town is situated just N. of the E. point of Kishm Island. I he town is well-built* and extensive, the sea frontage being about 800 yards. The population was stated in 1901 to be about 6,000.

Also there are several domed reservoirs a short distance S. of the tOAvn (presumably at the point marked “ Tank ” on inset Chart 2 , 837 a, about 1,400 yards to the S.). c Nearly half the town has been destroyed during the last few years by earthquakes, notably that of 1896.54 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES.

For proposed telegraphic communication, see under Henjam Island, note, p. 56. There is an old Portuguese fort* close to the shore at the S. end of the town. It is very conspicuous from seaward. There is no information as to its present condition, but presumably it is useless against modern guns. As far as is known there are no other defences. It should be noted that the land VV. and S. of the town rises gradually from the sea, becoming precipitous and broken to the W. and N.W. The highest part is a tableland, 560 feet high, 3 miles W. of the town. It is believed that there are no native forces available for defence purposes. Note .—After the British expedition of 1819 several hundred British and Indian troops were stationed in the vicinity of Kishm Town in 1820, for the purpose of overawing the Jowasmi pirates. The troops suffered heavy losses from climate, and were transferred first to Salak Point (close to Henjam Island) and then to Bassidu. The roadstead between Kishm and Bunder Abbas, at the entrance of Clarence Strait, was the rendezvous for the British fleet and transports at the commencement of the Persian war of 1856-57. In 1902 the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, expressed a high opinion of the strategic importance of this roadstead. According to a Press report in 1902 Bussian emissaries tried to induce the Sheikh of Kishm to act as agent for vessels of the Kussian Volunteer Fleet, with what result it was not known. HENJAM ISLAND. {See Admiralty Charts 2,837a (with inset) and 753.) Henjam Island lies off the S coast of Kishm Island, and is separated^ from it by a strait about 1 mile broad, known as Henjam Sound. The island is about 5 miles long (N.N.E. and S.S.W.) by 2i miles broad, and is very hilly. It is^chiefly valuable' for its salt mines ; 5,000 to 7,000 tons of salt being exported yearly to Calcutta.

There are no repairing facilities, but light draught vessels can No repairing beach on the W. side of the spit running out from the N. point facilities, of the island. Coal. There is no coal. Supplies. Water .—After rain some water can be had from the ruined reservoirs at the N. end of the island, and there is a well of fairly good water near the village, about a quarter of a mile from the S.L. point (“ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898). According to a report made in 1901, there are tliree wells and reservoirs about 2 miles from the salt mines (? identical with ruined reservoirs mentioned by the “ Pilot”). 1 he water is said to be good, but it is customary for people who work at the mines to take water with them. If the reser voirs were repaired, there would probably be sufficient water for a small number of men. Referring to water supply at the anchorage, a report made in 1900 stated that this could only be assured by condensing water and storing it in reservoirs. Food .—A few provisions may be obtainable. Some goats are kept at the village near the S. point. There is no information as to roads or as to communication b}' Communica- water. • tions. It has been suggested that a wireless telegraphy station on the island, in touch with other points at the entrance of the Gulf, might be of great value for naval purposes. A proposal has been made to land one of the Cape Jashk- Bushire cables at Henjam, and re-establish the British cable station on the island, which was abandoned in 1881 (see note below). It has also been proposed to connect Henjam with Kishm ° The anchoiage and surroundings were carefully examined in June 1903. It was considered that to improve the harbour by means of engineering works would be difficult, and not worth the labour and expense./ Defence. 56 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Town, either by lan'I line or cable, and Ivishm 1 own with Bunder Abbas by cable ; also to connect Henjamwith the British station at Bassidu if necessary. (Compare proposal under Bassidu, p. 52.) According to the report made in 1900, already referred to the sugo-ested artificial harbour could be defended if strong forts were built on the island and on the Kishm shore opposite. The width of the navigable channel is about half a mile. Note .—Although the population of Henjam is now small, at one time the island was densely inhabited, as the extensive ruins prove. The two cables which now connect Cape Jashk with Bushire both pass through the Straits of Ormuz, S. of Ilenjam. Previous to 1885 there was only one cable, and up to 1881, this cable lay in the channel N. of Henjam Island, on which from 1869 to 1881 there was a station of the Indo-Europeon Telegraph Depai tment. An opinion was expressed in the report of 1900, already referred to, that Henjam Sound would make a good naval station if properly equipped with buildings, &amp;c., on shore, as it is within easv patrolling distance of the entrance of the Gulf and the adjacent harbours of Hormuz and Bunder Abbas * After the expedition of 1819, the troops originally quartered at Kishm Town were removed for a time to Salak Point on Kishm Island, about 6 miles W. of Henjam, previous to their transfer to Bassidu in 1821. LARAK ISLAND. (See Admiralty Chart 2,837a (with inset).) Larak Island is situated at the entrance of the Gulf, about 7 miles S.E. of Kishm Town. There is an anchorage off the old Dutch fort on the N. shore, but it is only sheltered from the Shamal. For tin's reason, the island appears to be of little value from a naval point of view, notwithstanding its commanding position. HORMUZ (or ORMUZ) ISLAND. (^e Admiralty Charts 2,837a (with inset), and 753.) The island lies on the N. side of the Persian Gulf entrance, about 10 miles N.N.E. of Kishm Town, and a little over 3 miles from the Persian coast. In shape, it is roughly circular, with a diameter of about 4 miles. 0 The report of Juue 1903 referred to in the footnote on pre'uous page considers that Henjam itself (apart from its strategic position) is not at all suitable for a defended naval establishment.HORMUZ ISLAND. 57 1 he surface is for the most part hilly, the highest point (690 feet), being near the centre of the island^ and very conspicuous. The island contains apparently considerable mineral wealth in salt, rock salt, red ochre, copper, and iron oxide ; the ochre is worked, and salt to a less extent, but the rock salt, of which most of the hills are composed, does not appear to be utilised. There is practically no cultivation. I here is only one village, at the N. end of the island, close to the old Portuguese fort. It contains from 150 to 200 huts and houses. The population is about 400 males. In former days, Hormuz was a point of great commercial importance. I he only trace of this now existing is the ruined city on the plain immediately S. of the old fort. At the present time there is some trade, chiefly in salt and salt fish, with Maskat and Bunder Abbas. The island is subject to the governor of Bunder Abbas, a guard of a dozen men being kept at the old fort. The distance of the N. point of Hormuz from— Distances. Bassidu - - - is 96 miles.

It is well sheltered, except from the Nashi, during which native craft move to the W. side of the fort. There are no repairing facilities. Coal. —There is no coal. Water. —According to a report made in 1901 there are six reservoirs and wells—the water being unfit to drink. There are many old reservoirs in the ruined city. No dependence can be placed on rain for water supply, as the surface drainage is saturated with brine from the salt hills. It might be possible to sink wells and protect them from drainage, but if not, condensers would be necessary. There is no information as to how the inhabitants of the ancient city overcame the difficulty. Food. —Apparently nothing hut salt fish can be obtained in any quantity. There is no information as to communications of any kind. Communica tions. No repairing facilities. Supplies.58 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Old fort. Humoured defences. The old fort was built by the Portuguese, and is situated on the N. point of the island, the highest point being 45 feet above the sea. According to a Press report the fort was damaged by an earthquake in 1902, but previous to that time it was in a very good state of preservation. The enceinte, enclosing about an acre, was entered through a massive sate studded with iron spikes and protected in front and flank by bastions. The inner work stood on a sharp rise, and contained a very fine reservoir. A number of ancient guns of small calibre still remained on the walls. The extent of the damage done by the earthquake has not been reported. The fort was captured by the British, in alliance with Shah Abbas, from the Portuguese, after a desperate resistance. In 1902, two 21 cm. and two 15 cm. modern guns were imported by the Persian Government, and in October of that year were lying in the Custom House at Bushire. It was rumoured that these guns were to be mounted on Hormuz Island. (See, however, under Bushire, p. 46.) Note .—According to the report made in 1900 (already referred to), provided the water difficulty were overcome, the N. point of Hormuz would be suitable for a naval and coaling station if properly equipped. Strong forts would be necessary to secure the anchorage from attack from eastward. The position commands the entrance of the Gulf and the port of Bunder Abbas. BUNDER (or BANDAR) ABBAS. (See Admiralty Charts 2,837a (with inset) and 753.) ^ Bunder Abbas lies on the N. shore of the Gulf entrance, due N. of Kishm Town. It is the centre of government of the district and adjaceur islands, and has considerable and increasing trade. The population during the cold weather is stated to be between 8,000 and 9,000. Ihe greater part migrates in the hot season to Minau and other places in the neighbourhood on higher ground, the heat in Bunder Abbas being almost insupportable. During the year 1901 the value of the imports was 422,735/., that of the exports, 154,613/. ; and 162 steamers entered the “ port.”* Ihe trade is chiefly in the hands of British subiects.

Cape Jashk, on the Persian coast, S.E. of the Gnlf entrance, is an important British cable station. Jashk itself, with its ruined fort, lies 6£ miles N. of the Cape and 1 mile inland ; it has a population of about 200 males, and does a little trade with Maskat. At Cape Jashk, in addition to the telegraph build ings, there is a village with a fortified residence for the Persian governor. The relative positions of the various buildings, &amp;c. are clearly shown on Plate 1. The native inhabitants are Baluchis. In January 1903 it was reported that good relations prevailed between the telegraph officials and the Persian authorities. There is very little trade. Dried fish is exported.

The best landing place on this side is on the sandy beach which extends for 1 mile between the cable house and the clifis E. of it. On the W r . side of the Cape there is an open anchorage for moderate draught vessels. Opposite this anchorage there is a good landing place a quarter of a mile N. of the main telegraph buildings and close to the residence of the Persian governor. There are no piers or built landing places. Landing is not possible in very heavy weather. Coal .—There is no coal. Firewood is abundant. Water .—The water supply is not very good, and great care and economy has to be exercised. No water is available for cultivation, &amp;c. The telegraph officials depend on rain-water for drinking and cooking, and on well water for other purposes. The sepoys of the native guard use well-water for everything. The wells and tanks are shown on Plate 1, and are as follows:— (1) Large and small wells about 1 mile N.E. of the telegraph station (shown as “ tank ” on Chart 2,862). The large well is lined with stone, and is connected with the small well, 20 yards away, by an underground passage.CAPE JASHK. 61 Close to the large well is an elevated covered cistern, filled from the well by a Persian wheel. AVater from this well is used by the sepoys for drinking and cooking, and is conveyed to their barracks on bullocks. The supply is fairly abundant at all seasons, and the water, though slightly brackish, is quite palatable. These wells are within the limits of the station, and are not used by natives from the village. (2) Well W. of the sepoy lines. Water used by sepoys for washing. Wells sunk round the lines and telegraph buildings supply only brackish water unfit to drink. (3) Small tank close E. of the telegraph office, supplied with water (for purposes other than drinking and cooking) from the main well (1). (4) ' West water tank,’ 5 lined with concrete and paved with stone ; capacity about 57,000 gallons. (5) “ East water tank,” lined with concrete; capacity about 77,000 gallons. Each of the tanks (4) and (5) is surrounded by a wall 3 feet high, and roofed over. Rain-water flows into them by cemented channels cut in the surrounding ground. In January 1903 the tanks were full and the supply was sufficient for 18 months’ consumption (allowing for 12 adults and three children). The tanks are entirely dependent on the rainfall, which some times fails for several successive years. The water has to be filtered before use. When the tanks fail water for drinking has to be brought from the main well (1). The water supply of the station could be increased by con structing additional rain-water tanks and by sinking more wells in the vicinity of the main well (1), where it is understood water of a similar quality can be relied on.

Sepoy lines. Hospital. Magazine. British garrison. Residence of Persian governor. Persian garrison. Defence. Cape Jashk is also the terminus of the land line which follows the coast from India. The “ Persian Gulf Pilot,” 1898 states that the telegraph buildings are in three blocks with flat roofs, the N. and S. blocks having conspicuous square towers. Plate 1, which is a copy of a plan made in January 1903, shows additional buildings, but it is not clear which are the original ones. The Sepoy Lines consist of four large detached barrack- rooms, each surrounded by a dwarf wall, together with small houses for the native officers. The barrack-rooms are understood to be of stone (walls 2 feet to 2 feet 6 inches thick), and have concrete floors and mud roofs. Each will accommodate 25 men. In January 1903 they were in good condition. The hospital is a building measuring about 60 feet by 30 feet. In January 1903 it was empty and had no furniture. In January 1903 the magazine ( 7 feet square inside) contained 24,000 rounds of rifle ammunition. The garrison in January 1903 consisted of 50 sepoys from an Indian regiment, with native officers. The lines would accommodate 100 men. In the village N.E. of the telegraph station and close to the shore is the “ fortified residence'’ of the Persian Governor of which no description has been received. * he Persian Governor has a guard of 40 Persian soldiers. The promontory on which the telegraph station is situated would appear to be easily defensible against a raid from the land side. The main wells (1 mile N.E. of the telegraph buildings) would, no doubt, if possible, be included within the outer defences, the natural position for which (judging merely by the Chart and assuming a_ sufficient garrison) appears to be a line a ong t le S. side of Jashk Creek and across the narrow strip between the creek and the E. shore. 1 The telegraph buildings suggest themselves asa reduit, except against artillery fire. ^ protected*** 1 tani&lt;S ^ buildin £ s '‘ ouId to be The fortified residence of the Persian Governor could also possibly be utilised.CHAHBAR. 63 CHAHBAR.

The best landing place at Chahbar is close to the fort on the sandy beach. A report of January 1903 stated that there is good landing opposite the telegraph station, and it was understood that men and stores could easily be landed except on very rare occasions.

The roof has a parapet about 2 feet high, and would be utilised for defence in case of necessity. Three stone barrack rooms (apparently in the main building) accommodate the native guard, and could hold 75 men. There are several mat huts outside the building.

Water for washing is pumped from here to a store tank in the compound, holding about 10 tons. The drinking water is carried to the compound on bullocks. The provision of another tank for drinking water appears to be desirable, as, at present, in case of attack, the water supply would probably be cut off. Wells sunk close to the sea are brackish.

E66 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. / APPENDIX. 1.—Official Statement of British Policy with regard to (1) the proposed Baghdad Railway ; and (2) Persia and the Persian Gulf generally. House of Lords. Tuesday, May 5, 1903.* Great Britain and the Persian Gulf. Lord Lamington asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Adairs for information (l) as to the negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the promoters of the Baghdad Railway Company ; (2) as to the policy of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the interests of this country in the Persian Gulf, and moved for papers. He said these questions were drafted before the withdrawal of the Baghdad scheme. With regard to the first question, therefore, he would only say that if there were any papers in reference to that scheme which the noble marquis could lay upon the table they would be read with interest by the public. As to the second question, for a hundred years Great Britain was supreme in the Persian Gulf, and we and our British Indian subjects were alone the real traders there. Our position in the Persian Gulf had been maintained by the expenditure of large sums of money, stated to be millions, and also at a great cost of life. His contention was that the Administration of India had held that the security of the Persian Gulf was necessary for the proper defence of the Indian Empire. Unluckily, while w^e maintained that position, we also allowed the Turkish suzerainty to survive, and supported the pretensions of Persia against other States, and particularly the State of Muscat. Only a year ago the noble lord the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs declared that it would be impossible tor us to abandon what we looked upon as our rights and position, not only in the Persian Gulf, but also in those provinces of Persia which bordered on the Indian Empire. They should next consider what had been done in the last 15 years, and in that period they had to remember the question of the Russian loan and Russia’s action with regard to the railways. He should like to have papers laid on the table with regard to this question. There was also the question of the bank, which was really and actually a branch of the Bank of 0 From the “Times” report, May 6th, 1903.v. 2 APPENDIX. G7 Russia. These matters and the question of the roads, surely, raised a question as to their trade with Persia. It was said that Russia must have an outlet in the southern sea, but Russia had no trade whatever in Southern Persia. The only object which she could have would be to form a naval base, and the only object of a naval base would be to threaten our trade with India. He believed that if they allowed any Power to come down into the Persian Gulf they would inflict a great injury on India, and enable that Power to strike them on the flank. They must not forget that they were now dealing with an important strategical position between this country, India, Australia, and South Africa—in fact, one of their most important bases. He recommended various reforms in our Consular system, which, complex as it was in pay and appointment, did not afford the support our commerce required. The strength of our position in the Persian Gulf and our influence there had sensibly lessened in the last 15 months, and from the facts it might be argued that further changes were contemplated. Anyone who read Lord Curzon’s book on Persia, and, among other publi cations, the series of articles in “ The Times,” must see how seriously at stake were our interests. There w r as danger that, irom drifting and neglect to face our responsibilities, we might get into a position from which war alone could extricate us ; and to avoid this he counselled a firm declaration of a well- considered policy. Lord Ellcnborough said that the establishment of a naval arsenal on the Persian Gulf w r ould be a menace to our trade not only with India and China but with Australia and New Zealand. He would sooner see Russia at Constantinople than a Great Power occupying a good harbour on the Persian Gulf. Since the Crimean War the equilibrium of Europe had changed, and many interests which were then thought vital to certain countries had ceased to be so. It was no longer a matter of primary interest to England and France v r ho should rule on the shores of the Bosporus or the Hellespont. If the Germans chose to build railways in Anatolia and Syria, he thought we might look on the proceeding in a friendly way ; but if they wished to extend the railway to the Persian Gulf, so as to menace our position there, that would be quite another matter. He was glad the noble lord had raised this question. The Marquis of Lansdowne *—The noble lord who introduced this subject explained to the House that, for reasons which he gave us, it was not his intention to deal at length with the earlier part of the notice which he had placed upon the paper. 1 shall follow his example, and take up very little of your lordships’ time in referring to it. I am, however, bound to make one or two remarks in consequence of what has fallen * Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs./ Baghdad Railway. 68 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. from the two noble lords; and before I do so I wish to point out to the noble lord who spoke first that he, like a good many- other people, is under a misapprehension when he conceives that negotiations have been passing between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the promoters of the Baghdad Railwav Company. There have been no negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the promoters of the Baghdad Railway Company, any more than there have been negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and any foreign Government on this subject. What has taken place is this. There were confidential communications—negotiations if you like to call them so— between His Majesty’s Government and certain representatives of the great financial houses in this country, with the object of ascertaining whether the conditions upon which this enterprise was being undertaken were of a kind which would permit His Majesty’s Government to offer it any encouragement whatever. J hose negotiations, as the noble lord told the House, are no longer in progress. The noble lord expressed a hope that I might be able to give to your lordships some papers relating to them. To that proposal I must give an unhesitating negative, lor that I will give your lordships reasons which, I think, you will consider sufficient. In the first place, as these communi cations are no longer proceeding, it is clearly not necessary that these papers should be supplied to the noble lord for any public purpose. It we had been, in his opinion, upon a dangerous incline, likely to lead us to any of those unfortunate results which he so eloquently described, if he had desired to arrest our progress by calling attention to the documents, there might be some reason for requiring their production ; but that is not the case. 1 here is another reason, which weighs even more strongly with me. Ihese communications were, as I said just uoav, of the most confidential character. Now, I am under the impression that the occasions upon which the British Govern ment finds itself in such confidential communication with the representatives of that great organism which we are in the habit of describing as the City, are of rare occurrence—probably much rarer in this country than in any other country in the world. But I (lo say that when those occasions arise, and when those confidential communications take place, it should be on the clearest possible understanding that the confidence which is given ;ind received is respected from beginning to end ; and I think we should ill requite the manner in which the gentlemen to whom I have referred have approached this question if we were to offer any encouragement to the idea that we should lay before 1 arliament or in any way give to the public the documents or the purport of the conversations that passed between us. 1 here is one other observation which I feel impelled to make on this subject. I make it in fairness to the persons to whom I have just now referred. It is this—that I am deeply convinced that throughout these discussions their object was not only to ascertain from us whether they could expect at our hands any encouragement for the project inAPPENDIX. 69 which they were interested, but also to ascertain from us whether anything which they were doing or leaving undone was detrimental to the interests of this country. (Hear, hear.) If both those considerations had been present to their minds, and they had had to choose between the two, I unhesitatinody express my view that they would have allowed the later consideration to prevail. VY ith regard to the enterprise to which reference was made by the two noble lords, I wish to say very little about it; but as this notice has been for some time on the paper, I can scarcely pass it over without any mention at all. Het me, in the tirst place, remind your lordships that this scheme for a railway to connect the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf is not a new idea by any means. I do not think I am wrong in saying that, for 60 years or more, the idea has been familiar to the people of this country. I happened to read the other day an account of a deputation received by Lord Palmerston on the subject. It may interest your Lordships to know that Lord Palmerston expressed himself as follows in regard to it. He said, “ The Government was “ fully alive to the importance of the Euphrates route. They “ had given it support, and would continue to support it ; blit “ he could not give an opinion as to a guarantee without “ reference to his colleagues.” Later there was a House of Commons Committee, presided over by Sir Stafford Northcote, which reported in favour of a scheme which apparently con templated an expenditure of 10 millions of British money upon it. In its report the Committee said that, amongst the advantages to be expected from the construction of the line, were the more rapid transmission of mails, the possession of an alternative and more rapid route for the conveyance of troops, and the great commercial advantage both to England and India which the opening up of the route would confer; and the Committee thought it worth the while of the British Govern- ment to make an effort to secure those advantages, considering the moderate pecuniary risk which they would incur. Viscount Goschcn .— What was the date of that ? The Marquis of Lansdowne. —1872. Now, my lords, far be it from me to suggest that because those views prevailed at that time therefore they should be received without question at this moment. But I do suggest that, considering the manner in which this Baghdad Railway project has been received in past years in this country, His Majesty’s Government could scarcely on this occasion have afforded to brush contemptuously on one side consideration of the proposals that were made. There was no moment, I believe, in the history of the question when the British public would have regarded it with feelings of indifference. Now, what was the situation with which His Majesty’s Govern ment found themselves confronted ? The noble lord towards the end of his interesting speech expressed the opinion that we had very nearly found ourselves with a German system established at/ 70 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Koweit. That shows how completely the noble lord has mis understood the position which llis Majesty’s Government assumed in regard to this question. What was the situation of tact witn which we had to deal ? There is in existence a Ger man railway -pure and simple, the Anatolian railway, stretching from a point not for from Constantinople to Konia. That was one jact. The other fact teas that a German company had been offered a concession under which it was open to them to extend this German railway from Konia to the Persian Gulf. Note, at no moment did we contemplate, did we ever discuss, the possibility of giving our adhesion or giving any support whatever to any project of that kind (hear, hear); and therefore, when the noble lord suggests that we contemplated the arrival of a German system at Koweit he entirely misapprehends the ideas that were present to our mind. What teas under our consideration was the possibility of obtaining the substitu tion for this purely German system of a line of an international, character, constructed under guarantees which would have secured permanently its international character and which would have secured for the commerce of all nations absolutely free and equal treatment from sea to sea. That was a very different proposal surely from the proposal to briny a German railway to the Persian Gulf ; and it was also part of the proposals which weie ventilated that this country should be given full equality with any other Power in respect to the construction of the line and in respect to its main tenance and control after it had been constructed. I therefore do not apologize for setting the noble lord right on a point with regard to wliich he, like many other critics, has, I think, fallen into a serious misapprehension. At any rate I suggest to your lord- ships that we might have been very severely taken to task if we had absolutely refused to discuss proposals of this nature, which at one time certainly seemed to point to a solution, which, I venture to think, might have been proved to be a prudent and states manlike solution of the difficulty. (Hear, hear.) I do not feel justified in taking up your lordships’ time further with regard to Fere’an Gulf the Baghdad Railway project. I now pass to the closely con nected subject of the Persian Gulf. I feel sure that the noble lord s interest in the Baghdad Railway scheme was because he felt it did closely affect our interests in the Persian Gulf. I do not yield to the noble lord in the interest which 1 take in the Persian Gulf, or in the feeling that this country stands with regard to the navigation of the Persian Gulf in a position different from that of any other Pow r er. I he noble lord told your lordships with abso lute truth that it was owing to British enterprise, to the expen diture of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf is at this moment open to the navigation of the world. It was our ships that cleared those waters of pirates ; it was we who put down the slave trade ; it was we who buoyed and beaconed those intricate waters. Well, at this moment out of a total trade in the Gulf ports of 3,600,000/.—the figures are those for 1901 ; we have none later—2,300,000/. represents the commerce of this country ; so that it is clear that, up to the present, at all events, we have succeeded in preserving a liberal share of that commerce. ButAPPENDIX. 71 there is no doubt that in the Gulf, as in other parts of Persia, we are feeling very keenly the competition of other Powers. That, I am afraid, is our fate not only in Persian waters ; nor can we expect, because we have been in the development of commerce throughout the world the pioneers of thatform of civilisation, that we shall always be able to maintain the position of superiority which we at first enjoyed. The noble lord asked me for a state ment of our policy with regard to the Persian Gulf. I think I can give him one in a few simple words. It seems to me that our policy should be directed in the first place to protect and promote British trade in those waters. In the next place I do not think that he suggests, or that we should suggest, that those efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legitimate trade oj other Powers. (Hear, hear.) In the third place—l say it without hesitation—we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. (Cheers.) I say that in no minatory spirit, because, so far as I am aware, no proposals are on foot for the establishment of a foreign naval base in the Persian Gulf. I at least have heard of none; aud I cannot help thinking that the noble lord waxed almost unnecessarily warm at the idea of such a foreign intrusion, with which, so far as I am aware, we are not at present threatened. Well, the noble lord then touched upon a series of points connected with our commercial interests in the Gulf. Lord Lamington .—As supporting our political position. The Marquis of Lansdowve .—It is impossible, to my mind, to dissociate our commercial and our political interests. Lord Lamington .—I agree. The Marquis of Lansdowne .— I will take the navigation of the Karun River. Karun River. That was opened in 1888. I was in India at the time, and I well remember the satisfaction with which Sir Drum mond Wolff’s achievement on that occasion in procuring the opening of the river to navigation was regarded both in India and at home. The trade of the Karun, although it has not increased perhaps as much as might have been anticipated, has increased considerably; and the lion’s share of it is ours. I sec that in 1897 the trade was only 26,000/., whereas in 1900 it had risen to over 1,000,000/. The noble lord spoke of the difficulties encountered by our traders owing to the Customs arrangements on the Karun. I do not know whether I quite followed what he said on the subject, but I may tell your lordships that the position is this. We were originally led by the Persian Government to expect that three Custom-houses would be maintained on the Karun, one at Mohammerah, the second at Ahwaz, and the third at Shuster. It appears that lately the Persian Customs authorities determined to do away with inland Custom-houses, and con sequently two of these were threatened with suppression. Well, persons interested in foreign trade naturally protested. It was a great inconvenience to them that goods destined for one of the72 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Persian Cus toms tariff. Railways in Persia. upper ports should have to be taken out of the ship’s hold at Mohammerah and there examined. Representations were made to the Persian Government ; and 1 am glad to say that the result has been that temporary arrangements have been made, or are about to be made, under which our traders will be given Customs facilities at these three ports as was originally intended. (Hear, hear ) The whole question of our commercial relations with Persia is at this moment engaging our most attentive considera tion, and particularly that question of the Customs tariff upon which the noble lord laid so much stress. The Customs tariff was, as your lordships will recollect, lately revised ; and I think the noble lord is justified in saying that that revision was not to the interest of British commerce. But I am inclined to think that the apprehensions which were felt on this point were some- Avhat exaggerated. I was relieved when I read the other day an account of the annual meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, at which a member of Parliament, Mr. Emmott, made the following statement:—“ The new tariff in regard to cotton “ goods had been carefully examined by Manchester merchants, “ who did not think it injured them. It was not preferential as “ regards Russia, and they do not believe the tariff would turn “ out to be any higher than previously.” That may be a san guine estimate; but it shows, at any rate, that some of the alarm felt was greater than the circumstances justified. The particular commodity which is most seriously affected by the new tariff is tea, and your lordships probably know that there is a large trade in tea between India and Persia. But here, again, I find that the Persian tea duties, when examined, are not very much larger than those which are imposed on tea in this country ; and, there fore, I am not sure that we can protest very loudly on that point. \Y here, I think, the noble lord has most right to com plain upon this question is as to this point. As matters now stand, all we can demand at the hands of the Persian Govern ment is most-favoured-nation treatment; and that, of course, we have got under the revised tariff. But we all know it is not very difficult so to adjust a tariff that, while it is in appearance equal in its operation with regard to all the Powers concerned, it really in effect discriminafes against some of them. And, therefore, I for one am not satisfied that this country should have to he content merely with most-favoured-nation treatment at the hands of Persia, dhat matter is the subject of negotia tion at this moment; and I have every hope that we shall be able to bring about an arrangement under which, instead of accepting tariff arrangements made between Persia and other 1 owers without reference to the effect of those arrangements upon us, we should be in a position to have arrangements of our own which will give us the right of insisting that, whenever 1 eisia again attempts to touch her tariff, British interests shall be specially considered. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord said a few words with regard to railways in Persia. I believe it is an open secret that a few years ago Persia undertook to defer the construction of any railways at all for a term of years. We wereAPPENDIX. 73 not parties to that arrangement, nor did we contract any obliga tions under it. The position in which we stand is this — that, whenever railway construction tahes place in Persia, we have a right to construct, or procure the construction of, railways in the southern part of that country. Persia will then he opened, not only to the capital and enterprise of other countries, hut to the capital and enterprise of this country as tvell; and, though that arrangement mm) not he recorded in any very formal inann r, we are satisfied that it is a binding engagement on the part of the Persian Govern ment, and we should certainly maintain that that is its character. Closely connected with the subject of railways is the subject of roads. As to that, there is a road between Teheran and Sultan- Roarls in abad which was built by the Imperial Bank of Persia—a British Persia, institution. There is also a caravan road between Ispahan and Ahwaz, which was built by Messrs. Lynch, a firm who have an honourable reputation for the enterprise they have exhibited in developing trade in Persia. Besides that, there are concessions for the extension of the Teheran-Sultanabad road to the Karun River, and also for joining Kom with Ispahan, and at this moment negotiations are in progress for the speedy construction of one of those two roads. This is a matter of considerable importance, because it will give road communication from the capital to a point on the Karun River, thus bringing Teheran into communication with the Karun navigation. In the matter of telegraphs, there is a convention, which was entered into last Telegraphs year, under which a British line is being constructed from ln 1 ersia - Teheran to the frontiers of India by the staff of the Indo- European Telegraphs Department under the Government of India. The line will be leased by the Persian Government to the Indo-European Telegraphs Department, it will be maintained by the British director and staff', and 140 miles of it have already been constructed under the conditions I have described. I have mentioned these points, which are points of comparative detail, to the House because I think they show that British interests have not entirely passed out of existence in Persia and that some progress has been made in maintaining them during the last few years. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord dwelt sadly upon the Russian loan to Persia. It is quite true that in 1900 Russian loan. the Persian Government secured a loan of about two millions sterling from the Russian Bank upon conditions of a somewhat onerous and inconvenient character. But I think the noble lord was in error when he said that that was due to the fact that we had refused to make any advance to the Persian Government. On the contrary, it was well known by the Persian Government at that time that we were willing to give them assistance; but for reasons of their own they preferred dealing with the Russian Government, with the result which we know. The only other point on which I need say a word is the question of the position of the Consular service in Persia. As to that, 1 am bound to say that my impression is that the Consular service has for some British Con- years past been undermanned in point of numbers, and also insufficiently equipped in point of that special knowledge which/ 74 PERSIAN GULF.— RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. members of the Consular service in remote countries like Persia should possess. Both of these aspects of the case have been dealt with, and I am able to tell the noble lord that a consider able number ot additional appointments have been made during the last two years. In 1900 a Vice-Consulate was created at Bandar Abbas. In the same year a Vice-Consulate was created at Seistan, and this post was raised to a Consulate last year. In 1900, again, we sent a Political Agent to reside at Bahrein. In 1902, a Consular Attache was appointed at Shiraz ; the Consulate at Ispahan was raised to a Consulate-General with an increased salary attached to it, and the salary of the Consul-General at Tabriz was also increased. Those are all improvements in the position of the Consular service; and we are at this moment in consultation with the Government of India as to a proposal to raise the Vice-Consulate at Mohammerah to a Consulate, to establish a Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz under Mohammerah, to raise the Native Agency at Kermanshah to a Vice-Consulate, and also to establish a Vice-Consulate at Shiraz. With regard to the other branch of the question—I mean the question of the training of these officers—two proposals are under examination. Cne is to the effect that a certain number of Persian studentships should be created to form part of the Levant Consular service. The alternative is that we should create a separate Consular service in Persia. Those proposals are being examined ; and I hope that before long I shall be able to announce to the noble lord that we have chosen one or other of these means for giving our Consular representatives in Persia that special knowledge which, under the present system, they have, perhaps, not sufficient opportunities of acquiring. I have said enough, I think, to show that we are not indifferent to the matters which tne noble lord has brought before the House. If there have been changes of late, I believe those changes have been, on the whole, in the direction of the assertion and the protection of British interests. As time goes on I hope that we may be able to make further progress in the same direction, and that, if the noble lord returns to the charge, as I daresay he will, at some future time, I may be able to report to him that we have been able to take still further means in the direction which he had so much at heart. (Cheers.) Lord Newton said the condition of the benches testified to the apathy with which this question was regarded. There were three ex-Viceroys of India who habitually sat on the benches opposite, but not one of them had thought it necessary to say a word on this subject. He congratulated his noble friend on having elicited from the Foreign Secretary a definite statement of great and almost historical importance. The Foreign Secre tary had put it on record that His Majesty’s Government would regard the acquisition of a naval port in the Persian Gulf as a grave menace to this country, and that such action would be resisted to the utmost of our power. He welcomed that state ment for the reason that we seldom made it clear what ourAPPENDIX. 75 interests were, and therefore it was not surprising that other couniries should be unaware of what we considered to be our interests. In this case, however, there could be no mistake. 2. —The Baghdad Railway Company. Notes on the Proposed Railway to connect Asia Minor with the Persian Gulf. (See Plate 2.) A concession to construct a railway in prolongation of the existing line of the German Anatolian Railway Company through Asia Minor to the Persian Gulf was secured by 'a German syndicate connected with that company in January 1902. The provisional terms of that concession are not given here as subsequent negotiations have modified the original plans and conditions. In March 1903 a convention was signed by which the Anatolian Railway Company agreed to establish a special “ Baghdad Railway Company,” with a share capital fixed provisionally at 15,000,000 francs (600,000/.) and to commence work as soon as possible on the new line, commencing at Konia, the B, terminus of the Anatolian Railway. In April and May 1903, an endeavour was made by the German promoters of the scheme to secure the co-operation of British, French, Austrian, and Swiss capital; the conditions, however, attaching to this participation left the effective control in German hands, and on these terms British capital could not be obtained. (See Appendix, p. 68, for the attitude of the British Government in the matter.) Notwithstanding this check, negotiations were continued with the other parties interested, and in June 1903 an agreement was drafted by which German and French Syndicates were to subscribe 40 per cent, of the capital each, whilst the remainder was to be left to Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Holland ; and the construction of the first section of the railway (Konia- Eregli) was to be commenced at once. To this agreement the French Government refused its sanction, and the German Company then decided to commence the first section (Konia-Eregli) without further delay. Construction was begun on 27th July 1903. Up to the present (September 1903) there is no further information as to the participation of international capital. The main line is to consist of 10 sections of about 200 km. The proposed (125 miles) each, the total length being about 2,000 km. (1,250 line, miles). This, however, does not include the projected branch lines. The following table shows the route of the existing railway from Haidar Pasha (opposite Constantinople) to Konia, and the route at present proposed for the extension to the Persian G ulf.76 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES.

The new railway is to be of the normal gauge of 1-44 metres (4-72 feet) with a single line, hut the construction is to be made with a view of the track being eventually doubled. 1 he weight of the rails is to be 37 kilos 240 grammes per metre (about 82 lbs. per yard). The rails are to be secured by chairs to steel sleepers.APPENDIX. 77 The maximum contemplated speed of trains is 90 km. (55*9 Speed, miles) per hour between stations, and 75 km. (46*6 miles) inclusive reekonirnr. It is desired that express trains may be able to cover the distance from Constantinople to Baghdad in 55 hours. On the original plans the concessionnaires estimated that passengers and mails could be conveyed from London to Bombay in 10 days 23£ hours, allowing for six hours delay at Constan tinople and at the Persian Gulf terminus. Taking the time of transit from London to Bombay via Suez at 14 days 16 hours, the concessionnaires claimed an advantage for their route of 3 days 16| hours. The company is to give the Turkish Government facilities for Telegraph, the construction of telegraph lines aloug the route. The company undertakes to construct terminal ports. At Terminal Haidar Pasha port works have been in progress for some P orts - time, and have reached a useful stage.* The site for the Persian Gulf terminus has not yet been determined, but Koweit and Umkasr have been proposed (see pp. 23 and 29). The concession to the new company is for 99 years from March Duration of 1903, and will run concurrently with that to the Anatolian Kail- concession, way Company, which has been renewed for the same term. It is understood that the railway must be completed and open for traffic within eight years, unless delays occur for which the company cannot be held responsible. The convention of March 1903 applied specially to the con- Financial struction of the first section, viz., that between Konia and conditions. Eregli, but it is understood that the financial conditions apply to the whole line. The Turkish Government guarantees to the company 11,000 francs (400/.) per kilometre, together with an additional 4,500 francs (180/.) per kilometre for working expenses. The Turkish Government obtains the money by the conversion of a 5 per cent, loan (understood to be the Fisheries Loan of 1888) into a new 4 per cent, loan on similar security, which it is stated will amount to 60,000,000 francs (2,400,000/.). The terms of the concession dealing with mining rights, taxes, division of profits, &amp;e., are not of sufficient interest to be given here. Note.—They existing line from Haidar Pasha to Konia taps country of great agricultural value. The country between Konia and Adana is particularly suited to wheat growing, and districts on either side of the Konia- Eregli section of the proposed line are already producing large quantities. ° The port was formally opened on 13th April 1903.78 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. To the E. of Aleppo the commercial prospects of the new line are at present somewhat vague. According to the original plan the main line was to pass through a number of important places which will now be served by branch lines only. The original route involved costly engineering work, especially among the foot-hills of the mountains between the Euphrates and Tigris, and those E. of the Tigris, whilst the shorter route now propor&gt;ed does not cross the latter river at all, anti keeps to the plains. This means that the line will pass through much unproductive country, and will leave the most valuable districts on one side ; but, in view of the heavy kilometric guarantee, it is to the advantage of the company to construct the railway as quickly and cheaply as possible, and to let the commercial future take care of itself. It may be noted that the conditions concerning the strength and gauge of the railway apply to the main line alone, so that the company will probably economise in the construction of the branch lines.* As the Turkish Government appears to be more interested in the strategical than in the commercial value of the railway, the shorter main route, with its advantages of quicker and cheaper construction, is equally acceptable to both parties to ihe concession. The proposed railway would confer on Turkey the strategic ad vantage of being able to transfer troops rapidly from European Turkey and Asia Minor to Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf, or vice versa, and would obviate the necessity for sea transport via Suez, which is the usual method of communication at present. 3.—Summary of Scheme for the Defence of Koweit. In September 1901 it was found necessary to devise a scheme for the defence of Koweit from attack by land. The following is an account of the conditions obtaining and of the measures proposed at that time. The scarcity of water in the district round Koweit, makes military movements depend very largely on the position of the wells. To the S. and W. of the line Koweit-Jehara, there is “ for many miles ” a desert stated to be Avaterless and understood to be on that account impracticable for a large hostile force. ° It is understood that the branches from the Tigris valley to Erbil, Kifri, and Hit are not likely to be constructed unless petroleum is found in paying quantities. The surface indications of petroleum in the vicinity of these places are favourable, but no development has taken place as yet.APPENDIX. 79 Possession of the wells at Jehara appears to be a necessity for a successful attack on Koweit town. Ihe easiest approach to Jehara is by the 13asra—Jehara roads which have wells at intervals. 1 he following shows the relative distances of places on these roads :— Alternative routes from Zoibeir to Jehara :— (o.) Via Sahwan —a slightly quicker route, but no water between Sahwan and Jehara. {h.) Via Omenaga —three watering places between Omenaga and Jehura, one of which is at Suweicheep, a little S. of Khutei. It is about four days march by either route from Basra to Koweit (This information was obtained from the Sheikh of Koweit.) The “road ” between Khutei and Jehara runs along the beach under the cliffs for several miles before approaching Jehara. General Idea governing the Scheme. Koweit town is threatened with attack by a large force of unknown strength and quality, which by reason of the nature of • Basra .

In the absence of information provision must be made against modern rifles and field guns. Kovveit is secure from attack by sea. Forces Available. The scheme mentions a body of 3,000 Arab riflemen (presum ably the “ mounted column ” referred toin another place), but does not state the total strength of the Koweit forces. There was unlimited labour for intrenching, &amp;c. The land forces were supported by the following vessels :— f&lt; Marathon,” “ Sphinx,” “ Lapwing,” and “Redbreast,” together with the shallow draught gunboats “ Assaye ” and “ RJassy ” and also the following dhows :— 6 fitted for 1—3-pr. Hotchkiss each. 2 „ 1—7-pr. R.M.L. „ 1 ., 1—9-pr. „ The dhows could be armed at one hour’s notice. The scheme proposed, if time allowed, to arm all the dhows with 9-prs. instead of the lighter guns, and to increase the number of dhows to 12. Field Guns required in addition to those Available. The scheme required 6—7-pr. field guns for use with the mounted columns; the guns were to be drawn by camels and served by Arabs (already well trained to the work with similar guns from the ships). Proposed Measures for Defence.* 1. Jehara Fort (commanding the wells 1,900 yards N.W. of it) to be held by trained Arabs with two Nordenfelt machine guns. The fort to be connected with the sea by a line of trenches (1£ miles in length) manned by 3,000 Arab riflemen. The “ mounted columns ” to be accompanied by 6—7-pr. field guns drawn by camels. The armed dhows and two shallow draught gunboats to lie in the Duhat Kathama, extended from a point as close as possible to Jehara, for several miles along the coast to the N.E. close in shore, with the object, (1) of commanding the beach road and denying it to a hostile advance, and (2) of supporting the Jehara trenches and fort with long range fire (distance 3,000 to 6,000 yards). (N.I.D. Note. —It was anticipated that holding the beach road would compel the enemy to advance via Sahwan. It is suggested with reserve that the enemy might have utilised the E. route and then crossed over to the desert route before coming within range of the ships’ guns). * It is Understood that no entrenchments and emplacements were actually constructed.APPENDIX. 81 2. It Jehara is forced, a retirement to be made on Koweit; the armed dhows to be towed over and their guns transferred to field carriages and mounted in emplacements already prepared outside The retreat of the land forces to be covered as long as possible by the gunboats in Duhat Kathama, and then by the “ Sphinx ” anchored in Bandar-ash-Shuwaik, and by a gunboat anchored in 3 fathoms N.N. W. of the S. end of the town (both vessels commanding the S. approach to Koweit with their fire). 3. Koweit to be defended by entrenchments and gun emplace ments previously prepared, supported by the fire of the “ Sphinx ” m Kandar-ash-Shuwaik, and the gunboat off the S. end of the town (the two positions indicated being the only ones which would be of use to ships defending the town). I he scattered wells E.N.E. of Bandar-ash-Shuwaik and S.W. of Koweit, to be defended by fire from the “ Sphinx” (directed from aloft) at 4,000 to 5,000 yards’ ran^e, crossing with that from the gunboat at 2,600 to 4,000 yards’ range. Other wells with abundance of water, about 3 miles S.S.E. of Koweit, which would be useful to an enemy, would have to be defended by the land forces, possibly assisted by a light draught vessel anchored in three fathoms to the E. of the wells, and°2i miles S.E. of Ras-al-Ajuza. 4. An entrenched camp to be prepared at the wells near Kas-a -Ajuza, to which the inhabitants of Koweit could be rapidly moved if it were necessary to abandon the town, it not being considered advisable, for political reasons, to remove them to ifailaka Island. I d he defence to be supported by fire from the gunboats pre viously in the Duhat Kathama—one anchored off Kas-al-Ajuza hve cables S.E. of Easht-eb Haduba, and the other in five fathoms K. of Kas-al-Ajuza. Ehe enemy to be shelled out of Koweit if they occupy it. . Wote- In December 1901, Koweit was again threatened, and it was proposed to defend it in the manner described above, except that two Maxims were to be mounted in Jehara in addition to the two Nordenfelts. The vessels then at Koweit were the “ box,” “ Perseus,” “ Sphinx,” and “ Redbreast.” A difficulty, however, arose with the Sheikh of Koweit, who (although he had approved of the original scheme) now insisted on making the chief defence at Jehara, which he stared was the trading centre for his tribesmen. He refused to retire on Koweit if Jehara were taken, as he preferred, in that event, to make terms with the enemy. Owing to the great range from navigable water to Jehara bort (6,000 yards), it was considered that fire from ships could not effectively support the defence, and that Jehara would inevitably be captured, unless the land forces of the Sheikh could be reinforced by troops with field guns. No further steps were taken in the matter, as the threatened danger was averted by other means. I 26291. r/ 82 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. 4.—Rumoured Turkish Scheme for the Defence of Kow£it and Khor Abdalla. Extract from “Internationale Revue,' &amp;'c.,for July 1902. The Turkish authorities are seriously considering the question of fortifying several strategically important points in the vicinity of Koweit, the projected terminus of the Baghdad Railway. A detailed project has been worked out and laid before the authorities by a Commission (specially convened for this purpose by the military administration) of which, since 1900, two German officers have been members. According to this scheme the two existing Turkish forts at Fao (mouth of Shatt-al-Arab) would be re-constructed and pro vided with modern outlying batteries. The garrison, which now consists of 65 men, would be increased to three companies of infantry together with the necessary artillery. Further, it was considered necessary to fortify the island of Bubiyan (S.W. of Fao) with at least two batteries each of two heavy guns on the E. shore. A similar battery would be placed on the promontory Ras Sabiya immediately opposite the S. end of Bubiyan Island. The two high promontories, Ras Ascheirij (W. of Koweit) and Ras al Arz (E. of Koweit), would also be fortified. No Turkish garrison is projected for the last two points, as the necessary men would be provided by the Sheikh of Koweit.* The Turkish Government would only furnish the armament. fy Note .—In February 1903 it was stated in the Russian press that orders had been given to commence building the works mentioned in the above scheme, but no confirmation of this has yet been received. The establishment of a Turkish post at Ras al Geit, on the E. shore of Bubiyan Island, may be in connection with the scheme. 5. Russian Influence in Persia and the Persian Gulf. Persia is bounded on the north by Russian territory and waters. Russian trade The principal roads in N. Persia have been constructed or in N. Persia, improved by Russian enterprise, supported by ihe Russian Government. The great length and difficulty of the routes connecting N. Persia with the Persian Gulf ports prevent the latter from sharing, to any large extent, in the transit foreign trade with ® This seems very improbable as long as the Sheikh maintains his present attitude.APPENDIX. 83 Russian trade in Central and South Persia. Railway con vention. that region. The foreign trade of N. Persia was originally built up by British merchants, working through Russian terri tory and encouraged by the Russian Authorities. The modern development of Russian industries led, however, to a change of policy, which, by means of preferential freights for Russian goods and political pressure on Persia, have practically driven British manufactures out of the N. Persian market. he great bulk of the trade at the present day is in Russian hands, and, under existing conditions, is likely to remain so. Russian cotton goods already have the upper hand in Central and bouth 1 ersia, and the Russian Government is making a determined endeavour to build up a commercial position in the 1 , ^ lth thl8 . view &gt; reduced railway and steamer freights have been established on yoods from the chief Russian towns by vvay of Odessa to Jidda, Aden, Jibuti, Maskat, Jashk, .bunder Abbas, Linga, Bushire, Basra, and Baghdad. The immediate object of this is, perhaps, political rather than com- mercial, but, to some extent, it may be intended to discount the effect on the trade of N. Persia by any non-Russian railway constructed in the future from a port on the Gulf coast. According to the so-called Secret Convention of 1890 between Kussia and 1 ersia, the latter (it is understood) “ engages neither t0 construct a railway in Persia nor permit others to do so, and will not grant any concession for the construction of railways in Persia to anyone.” This agreement expired in 1900, and was then renewed for a term of five years. The Persian Customs have recently been taken over by a Belgian administration, which appears to be efficient. It is ostensibly independent of Russian influence, but it may be noted that Belgium is politically sympathetic to France, and that -belgians have considerable financial interests in S. Russia. !t ,T he reliable portion of the Persian Army is the Cossack ^ cavalry brigade, which is commanded by a Russian officer, assisted by several Russian instructors. Under the cir cumstances, this small force Yvould doubtless play an important part in any internal crisis. “ t'T .1 la W e -.

By this agree- ment the Russian Government grants the Company an annual subsidv of fii i '• j roubles) for 12 years beginning in 1903.

British financiers having failed on account of the doubtful security offered.* It is obvious that Kussian financiers must have had the guarantee of their own Government, which, judging by the recently published Persian Customs Tariff, made a very sound political speculation. The foregoing is sufficient to show that Russia is an im portant factor in Persian politics, but only the chief sources of influence have been indicated. It appears to be safer to assume Russian influence in all Persian affairs until it is proved to be absent. 6. Karun River. Freights to Ahwaz and Transport hegond. In a circular issued in February 1903 by the concessionaires (Messrs. Lynch Brothers), it is stated that rates of freight bv the ocean steamers to Mohammerah are the same as to^Bushire, and the freight from Mohammerah to Ahwaz i 8 13 $. per ton on general cargo; further, that the distance to Isfahan from Ahwaz i S 270 miles, the journey occupying about 15 clays, against o30 miles from Bushire, whence the journey (via Shiraz ) occupies about 30 days. From Ahwaz there is a well- beaten track as far as Khm, and from Kum a carriage road to Teheran. Cost of land transport cannot be arranged on this side, owing to the rates varying so much according to season. It is stated, however, that when freight from Bushire to Isfahan costs 10/. per ton, the charges from Mohammerah, includhur river freight, would not exceed 8/. Insurance can be effected through from London to Isfahan or Teheran. The following hints are given as to the weight and dimensions oi packages, viz.:— t( As on all the caravan routes of Persia the weight and dimensions of packages are a most important factor, goods run the risk of being delayed should their bulk be excessive. his is a matter not likely to be lost sight of by yourself, but our experience is that shippers from Europe frequently trangress in over-estimating the carrying capacity of mules and camels; hence extra expense and delay. For mule transport no package or case should exceed cwt., or say 75 kilogs. Long-shaped cases are preferred They may be 3 ft. (m. 0-90), even 3A ft. m k ut should not exceed 2 ft. by 1A ft sils ter' s— ~ the length can be increased to 4 ft.

The See, however, Lord Lansdowne’s statement, p. 73.APPEXDIX. 85 weight should be about 2 cwt. (kilos. 100), in no case over cwt. (kilos. 120). We cannot, however, always count on securing camel transport.” 7.—Historical Notes from the Persian War of 1856-7.* (1) Operations in the Vicinity of Bushire in February 1857. (See Plate 3.) Bushire had been captured on 10th December 1856 by a British army under iVlajor-General Stalker, supported by a naval squadron under Kear-Admiral Sir H. Leeke. On the arrival of reinforcements from India on 30th January 1857, Lieutenant-General Sir J. Outram had assumed command of the whole expeditionary force. As intelligence had been received that the Persians were making extensive preparations for the recapture of Bushire, and that they had already assembled 800 cavalry, 5,100 infantry, 1,000 auxiliaries, and 18 guns, under the command of the Sooja Ool Moolk, in an entrenched position at Borasjoon (some 46 miles N.E. of Bushire), Sir J. Outram decided to attack this force before its numbers grew more formidable, d he flying column detailed for this purpose was commanded by Sir J. Outram in person, and consisted of the following troops :— Cavalry - 419 British infantry - 2,212 Native infantry 1 Details / - 2,022 Total 4,653 with 18 guns, Whilst there were left to guard the camp outside Bushire— European infantry - - - - 378 Native infantry - - - 1,466 One company European artillery and 14 guns.

British force attacked at once and completely defeated enemy, who retired in great disorder pursued by cavalry. Action ended by 10 a.m. Troops bivouacked. March resumed 8 p.m. in heavy rain (which continued for three days). Marched all night. February .—Bivouac 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. March resumed. Infantry reached Bushire before midnight. The Persian loss in the action at Kooshab was 700 dead, not including the loss in the pursuit. The British loss was 19 killed and 64 wounded, besides casualties among followers. The endurance of the British troops on this expedition was re markable. They marched from Bushire to Borasjoon, 46 miles, in 41 hours “ in the worst of weather.” On the return journey from near Borasjoon they marched 44 miles in 50 hours (the last 34 hours under incessant rain, which converted the country into a morass) and of this time 10 hours were occupied by the fighting at Kooshab. On the return of the expedition from Borasjoon the troops were occupied in throwing up five redoubts to cover the British position outside Bushire. Four of the redoubts were placed so as to sweep the isthmus to the south and the fifth in rear of these in order to secure communication with the town. All were armed with guns of position, and one contained two 68-pounders. (2) Expedition to Mohammerah (Mohumra), 1857—(See Plate 4 .) . After the successful operations in the vicinity of Bushire j 1 ^ e ^ )ruar y 1857 (described above) Lieutenant-General Sir J. Outram left General Jacob in command at Bushire, and Bailed on 18th March with an expedition to Mohammerah, v nek it was proposed to occupy with a view to further operationsr APPENDIX. 87 in the interior of Persia. The expedition was composed as follows:— Troops. Naval Squadron. Cavalry (392.) Two batteries of artillery. Two British infantry battalions. Two Native infantry battalions, and details. Total 4,887 of all ranks and 12 guns. Conveyed in eight transports. Steamers “ Feroze.” “ Semiramis.” “ Assaye.” “ Ajdaha.” “ Victoria.” Sloops “ Clive.” “ Falkland.” “ Berenice.” Under the command of Commodore Young, I.N. The Persian force holding Mohammerah was under the command of the Shahzada and consisted of about 13,000 men (of which about 7,000 were regular troops). The chief defences of Mohammerah were two batteries, one on each side of the entrance to the Hafar Channel from the Shatt-el-Arab (see Plate 4), together with several minor works further up that channel on the N. side. The large N. and S. batteries were powerful open earthworks with casemated embrasures. The exact armament is not stated.* The following is a brief summary of the British operations : — 24th March .—Steamers towing transports assembled after dark at rendezvous three miles below entrance to Hafar Channel. Batteries reconnoitred during night. Two islands (the “ Dubbees ” no longer existing in 1903) close to W. bank of Shatt-el- Arab, examined and found unsuitable for proposed mortar battery. 25th March .—Raft constructed and armed with 2 8-in. and 2 5^-in. mortars. Horses and guns of artillery, portion of cavalry and infantry transhipped into boats and small steamers in readi ness for landing. During the night mortar raft towed by the “Comet” into position under cover of Dubbee Island opposite the entrance of the Hafar Channel; being unobserved, movement not molested. 2&amp;th March .—Mortars on raft, manned by artillery, opened fire at dawn outhe N. and S. batteries; only the 8-in. mortars proved effective. “ Semiramis ” (with “ Clive ” in tow) and “ Ajdaha ” moved into W. channel to support mortar raft. On fire from forts slackening, remainder of squadron moved up H. channel of Shatt-el-Arab and also engaged forts. “ Semiramis,” “ Clive,” and “ Ajdaha ” then withdrew from W. channel and joined the other vessels in close attack on forts. Supposed position of * The sixteen 12, 9, and 6-pr. guns and one mortar found here when the Persians abandoned the works were probably supplemented by the field guns of the Persian army.88 PERSIAN GULF.—RESOURCES AND DEFENCES. Persian camp was also bombarded (afterwards discovered, with effect). At 7.45 a.m. batteries were only able to reply from three or four guns. Between 9 and 10 a.m transports, with about 1,400 troops and followers, were brought up the hi. channel past the scpiadron engaging the forts, fortunately without loss. Troops disembarked, covered by fire from “ Feroze ' and “ Ajdaha,” at a point on E. bank of Shatt-el-Arab about 2,000 yards above N. battery. Landing parties from “ Semiramis,” “ Clive,” “ Victoria,” and “ Falkland ” then drove the Persians from N. and S. batteries. Landing of troops completed by 1.30 p.m. Advance at once made on Persian entrenched camp. On approach of British force lersian army retreated precipitately, abandoning enormous quantities of stores. For want of sufficient cavalry British pursuit ineffective. Very few casualties among the troops, ■p aval casualties only 5 killed and 18 wounded. This slight loss due to the fact that all vessels engaged used trusses of compressed hay to give additional protection to the crews. Mohammerah was occupied by the British force until 15th May 1857.

The expedition consisted of :— 2 companies 64th Regiment. ^ 78th Highlanders.

Arabs reported that Ahvvaz itself was held by 500 infantry and 30 cavalry. The flotilla steamed to within 3,000 yards of the main Persian position, and captured a baggala containing a Persian 12-pr. g un - It being discovered that the Persians had only two small boats for communication between Ahwaz and the main army, it was decided to attack the town, and, if possible, to destroy the Persian supply depot there. The troops were accordingly landed between 10 and 11 a.m. at the point shown on Plate 5, where the jungle concealed the weakness of the force, and the advance on the town was made in widely extended formation, so as to give an impression of considerable strength. The left flank of the advancing troops was protected by two gunboats, which moved up the river and shelled the guns in the main Persian position, which, however, made no reply. The garrison of Ahwaz did not await the attack and retreated up the river. At noon, after an hour’s bombardment by the gunboats, the main Persian army commenced to retreat. At about 12.30 p.m. the sheikh surrendered the town, and working parties commenced the destruction of stores in the Persian magazines—the remainder of the troops being disposed under cover in case of fire from the Persian guns across the river. These still remained silent and presently retired. Directly the Persian rearguard had left the main position a detachment crossed the river in a gunboat, look possession of the camp and destroyed considerable quantities of abandoned stores. By 2 p.m. the Persian army had disappeared. The expedition remained unmolested at Ahwaz until 3rd April, and then returned to Mohammerah, which was reached next day. It subsequently transpired that the Persians took the expe dition to be the advanced guard of Sir J. Outrarn’s army, and as they had only seven mule-loads of musket ammunition left for their whole army, they considered resistance hopeless.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000912.0x000005_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/64</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x000005</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/64</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'PERSIAN GULF AND GULF OF OMAN.
