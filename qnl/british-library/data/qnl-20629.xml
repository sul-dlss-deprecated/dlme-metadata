I now enclose a copy of a second letter from Ballantyne, also dated 12th August, enclosing a suggested redraft of I assume we are all agreed that it is very much in the interest of the Sheikh and H.M.G. to secure that a refinery should be set up in Bahrein, and while it would have been preferable to secure this without any concession on our side, an arrangement on the basis of the Company’s ^&lt;proposal in regard to the extension of the period of $ validity of Article 3, especially in the light of tb explanation given by Ballantyne, seems one which in all the circumstances we could reasonably put to the Sheikh. As regards the proposed redraft of Article 3, you will see that it is of a very sweeping character. Ballantyne spoke at our interview about exemption from any Company tax or tax on iDrofits (it was a passing reference only and was not, I think, included in the record). That would seem reasonable, but the present redraft appears to cover even / / Article 3 of the Company’s lease. C. Starling Esq., Petroleum Department licences/ Mines Department, S.W. 1.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100025598323.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/681, f 15v</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025598323.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/681, f 15v</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'MAP SHOWING SELECTION BY THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED UNDER CONCESSION DATED DECEMBER 2ND 1925'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-08T10:43:20</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 map sheet</extent><extent>Materials: 1 parchment folioDimensions: 328 x 90 mm</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The second schedule to the lease dated 29 December 1934 made between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Bahrain Petroleum Company showing the area selected by the Bahrain Petroleum Company under their concession agreement with the Government of Bahrain signed 2 December 1925.
