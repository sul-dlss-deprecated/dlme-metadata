Cigarettes for Persian Gulf. 2 . Following are my comment* : - / I ^ Bahra in. Cigarettes from the Golden Tobacco Company have not been imported and those from the Maple Tobacco Company were not popular. Curtailment of Indian cigarettes to 3.2 millions per quarter from the Maple Tobacco Company only is recommended. Kuwait . Maple Tobacco Company products are unsaleable in Kuwait. Present allotment of Indian cigarettes may be reduced to 3 millions a quarter from the Golden Tobacco Company. Muscat . Maple and Golden Tobacco Companies are not now supplying cigarettes. (See Bushire express letter No. Ill - S dated the 23rd January, 1946.) Truclal Coast . As Imperial Tobacco Company, India, will now cease to supply cigarettes to the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms and as merchants on the Trucial Coast have no business connections with the United Kingdom it is suggested that the Maple Tobacco Company may be instructed to supply 1.20 millions a quarter to the Trucial Coast. No change. Total requirements of cigarettes from Maple and Golden Tobacco Companies will therefore be 8.16 millions a quarter against their present quota of 15.7. 3. It is not known how far the Persian Guf Sheikhdom** requirements from the United Kingdom of 53 tons and 4 cwt. during the second half of 1945 put forward in my telegram No. A/972 dated the 21st June, 1945, correspond to the allotment of 6,000,000 cigarettes per month. It is presumed that this quantity of cigarettes is within the tonnage allotment. This may v indly be confirmed. (Signature) / 4 . S. 44. (Designation)4* It is regretted that the Persian Gulf Ghaikhdoma do not appear to be prepared to order Indian cigarettes from the Maple and Golden Tobacco Companies up to their present quota of 15•7 millions per quarter as their products are considered to be of inferior quality and are found to deteriorate in the hot and moist climate of the Gulf. It seems that it would therefore be idle to fix a quota above the 8.15 millions suggested since the quota amounts would almost certainly not be taken up. = BRITAIN * The issue of the above has been authorised.
