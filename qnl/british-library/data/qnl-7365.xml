A HANDBOOK OF ARABIA Volume II ROUTES Prepared on behalf of the Admiralty and the War Office ADMIRALTY WAR STAFF INTELLIGENCE DIVISION (C.B. 405) MAY, 1917 — ' ' niuiijjppiJiiiii'P ' 'v?) Confidential. Attention is called to the penalties attaching to any infractionNOTE This volume of the Handbook of Arabia is devoted mainly to detailed routes, preceded by two chapters on methods of transport and lines of communication ; the facts with regard to the available suppiy of camels among the Bedouin tribes, incorporated in the first chapter, are from native information obtained since the outbreak of the war. The routes are arranged on a geographical basis, which follows, with some modifications, the arrangement of chapters in Vol. I. The Northern Routes are described first, as they form the inland lines of approach to Central Arabia from the Syrian Hamad and the Mesopotamian plain. The Eastern Routes to the centre, from the Shatt el- Arab and the Gulf Coast, naturally succeed those from the Euphrates Valley. The two trunk-routes through Central Arabia are next described, and then follow the Western Routes, beginning with the Hejaz Railway and with tracks into Central Arabia from intermediate stations on the line, from towns on the Red Sea littoral, and from Medina and Mecca. Erom this point the arrangement follows that of Chapters IV-VIII in Vol. I, the last route in the volume linking up the series of South-Western, Southern and South-Eastern Routes with the Eastern Routes already described. The authorities from which the routes have been compiled, together with notes on direction and distance, are given at the head of each ; descriptions of the character of a route and its supplies will be found in the corresponding section of the chapter on communica tions, to which a page-reference is added at the head of the route. The references which follow the names of towns in the body of a route refer to descriptions in Vol. I ; all other references are to the pages of the second volume. Wherever possible a route has been divided into stages of a day's march, the length of which is of course determined by local conditions and the occurrence of water , in little-known country, or where water is carried and6 [NOTE camping-places are optional, the stages are sometimes longer. The mileage is registered in two columns, of which the inner refers to the stage, the outer to the total distance traversed ; inset figures give the distance in miles from point to point. Measurements in kilo metres have been retained only for the Hejaz Railway, which is constructed on a kilometric basis ; and in routes over difficult country the time taken is sometimes added within parentheses. An attempt has been made throughout to decide between con flicting authorities, but where that is impossible the information of each is given. Where native information only is available, as in the group of Asir Routes, distances must be regarded as not more than approximately correct. Some idea of the varieties of country traversed by the routes may be gathered from the plates at the end of each volume. Chapters have been incorporated on Meteorological Observations, Hygiene and Disease, and Vocabularies. The most important languages for Arabia are naturally Arabic and, in a far less degree, Turkish ; for use in some of the towns and islands of the Persian Gulf, Persian vocabularies and phrases have also been included.?

The system of transliteration adopted is explained in greater detail in the Note on pp. 467 ff. Conventional spellings of names, when sanctioned by long tra dition, have been retained, e. g. Bedouins, Mecca, Mocha, &amp;c.; and in some well-known names accents have been omitted, as in Asir, Hejaz, and Oman. For a list of Conventional Spellings, with their correct equivalents, see p. 473.CHAPTER I METHODS OF TRANSPORT The Camel, the Horse, and the Ass txt ? 11 ? 1 gen ® ral a S ent of communication in Arabia is the camel Wheeled vehicles ply only in and near Aden and (rarely) in and ^ ( as f ar as Bo'an on the Hodeidah road, and Raudhah on the Khamir road) ; they are not used on the Jiddah-Mecca road but it is said to be possible to drive from Mecca to Ta'if by making a long detour northward via Seil. But for the ingrained conserva tism of the Arab, wheeled traffic might be extended in various directions over hard desert; a motor-car containing Turkish officers ^ 0 ^ e ni of the Ilashid family recently (1916) went from Ha'il to Mu adhdham in a single day. Doughty notes that carts might follow the Ha] j route between Damascus and Meda'in Salih, since the Turks annually send a field-piece on its carriage there and back with the relief expedition which meets the returning pilgrims, and he thinks that even the 'Aqabah would not be too difficult, ' For women, sick persons, or those who would travel at ease, litters were borne by camels and mules on the above route in 1876. The riding-camel {dhelul, plur. dhulul), is almost always a female • the burden-camel is usually male. The life of camels may extend to forty or fifty years ; they are trained to carry loads from the third year, but are not reckoned fit for regular work till the sixth (see p. 19) ; and though in regions where they are well treated, as m Nejd, they may work when about twenty-five years old, they are commonly worn out before reaching half that age. The fact that the cameHs incapable of attachment, and indifferent to the rider is emphasized by Palgrave, who describes it as ' from first to last an undomesticated and savage animal, rendered serviceable by stupidity alone, . . . never tame, though not wide awake enough to be exactly wild '. But those who travel in deserts, where one s life depends on the camel, usually do not so condemn it. Doughty, for example, speaks more kindly of the camel than Pal grave, and, while fully alive to its shortcomings, reflects Arab sentiment in the phrase, ' Yet is the camel more beautiful in our14 METHODS OF TRANSPORT eyes than th.G gazelles, because man sees in this creature his whole welfare, in the khala.' The great virtue of the species is patience. Though resenting the process of being laden, when once started camels will go on until they fall so utterly exhausted that it may be necessary to destroy them : it is cheaper to buy three new camels than to bring one exhausted beast round (Nolde). If well treated, they do not bite or kick. The driver makes the laden beast kneel by uttering a guttural cry like ikh-kh-kh ! ; if that fails, he strikes him with hand or driving-stick upon the neck ; if there is still resistance, he draws him down by the beard. If a couched camel is unruly, the Arab controls him by laying hold of the cartilage of his nose, whereupon he is at once amenable. The trot is the dromedary's easiest pace ; the walk, if long continued, has been described as back-breaking for the inex perienced. ' Camels at a descent are wooden riding ; the lumpish brutes ... let themselves plumb down with stiff joints to every lower step ' (Doughty). After rain, upon loamy or slippery soil, they are useless, slipping so badly that a halt must be made until the ground is dry. They differ greatly in size and strength in various'parts of Arabia. In the Mecca country they are feeble ; the largest and most powerful are those bred by the Anazah in the north ; the fastest come from Central Arabia and Oman, though the breed of the country behind Aden is locally renowned for speed. The pure-blooded camel does not flourish at too great a distance from his native region. The Turks have used thorough-bred Arabian dromedaries for carry ing dispatches in Mesopotamia and the Syrian desert; but it is said that N. of the 30th parallel they soon deteriorate, and cannot maintain their former speed (Nolde). Central Arabian camels are generally grey or white ; in the north a dun colour is preferred, while black is supposed to indicate an uncertain temper. The Bedouin camel picks up its food where it can, living on the roughest grazing, browsing on thorny acacia and tamarisk, and finding no small part of its sustenance in the rimth, a saline bush ' which is to camels as flesh-meat to man '. Where special effort is required, or grazing is insufficient, food is carried. The great Hajj camels do not browse, but are fed, as in Syria, on balls of boiled pulse, with addition of knot-grass forage {thurm). The 'Uqeil (Ageyl) usually carry a mixture of millet and coarse flour, called alej, which they make up every night into balls the size of a man's fist, giving five or six to each of their camels. In S. Nejd the Arabs roll dates into balls, stones and all, and these are reputed to be beneficial as medicine (Leachman). When the spring pasture begins, the camels increaseJO THE CAMEL, THE HORSE, AND THE ASS 15 in vigour and put on flesh. At this season they will go more than two months without drinking, the moisture in the succulent fresh plants sufficing for their needs. In winter they can pass a full week waterless without discomfort; in summer they must usually drink at intervals of three days, though a good dromedary, carrying only a rider, will subsist without water for two days longer. A well-bred dromedary will perform great feats of endurance. Leachman states that mail-carriers between Damascus and Baghdad have ridden 60 miles a day for 9 days in succession. Nolde tells of a dromedary given him by Ibn Rashid which accomplished 62| miles between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. ; it had already traversed nearly 30 miles during the previous day, and repeated this distance on the day following. He adds that Ibn Rashid was accustomed to send messengers from Ha'il to Basra (about 375 miles) in six days, and from Ha'il to Medina (about 250 miles) in three and a half days. Burckhardt relates that a hundred and fifteen miles were once covered in eleven hours ; with relays. Central Arabian camels carried a present sent by Nolde to the Emir of Nejd over the 400 odd miles from Basra to Riyadh in three days, an average of 135 miles a day. Performances such as these are of course exceptional. The usual speed of a caravan is not more than two and a half miles an hour for a day of about nine hours, so that twenty-five miles is a respectable day's journey. Where the going is good, and heavy loads are not carried, this rate may be exceeded by a quarter or a half mile an hour. Shakespear did three miles an hour over a great part of Route 9, his pace only dropping to two and a half miles over soft sand. But if camels graze as they go, as is usual on steppe, it seems that even two and a half miles is too high an average for ordinary caravans. The loads carried may rise to 400 lb., but naturally vary with the camel's size and strength, the nature of the country, and the length of the stages : on desert routes, 330 lb. have been given as an average burden, and exceptional animals will carry up to 600 lb. From the above facts it may be inferred that if camels were available in sufficient numbers they might, under favourable conditions, supply a considerable army. General Skobeleff told Nolde that with a million camels he could secure the transport of 150,000 men invading India. Horses in Arabia are ridden by Sheikhs and their relatives, and are especially valued for use in war, since over short distances they will outstrip or overtake even the fastest dhelul. For purposes of general transport, they are negligible, as they soon suffer from thirst and cannot stomach the coarse grazing which contents16 METHODS OF TRANSPORT the camel. According to Doughty, a horse in summer will drink one-third more than a camel, and the carriage of water for it on a l on g journey becomes a serious impediment. Food is hardly less troublesome, though with the nomad tribes the difficulty is over come by providing the Sheikh's mare with a foster-camel, on the milk of which she lives when other food is not to be obtained. For these reasons the horse is an expensive possession, and is not owned by poor men. Arab horses are entire, and mares are preferred for riding. As a rule, the Bedouin rides either bare-back, or on a pad with a slender girth, guiding his mount with a halter only ; the bit is unknown in the desert, and hoofs are commonly left unshod. But on the Syrian borders even Bedouin sheikhs will ride with a Damascus saddle and stirrups, using the sharp Syrian bit; they will also shoe their mares, purchasing their yearly provision of horseshoes in the Hajj market at Damascus. Even in the Sa'ud country, Doughty observed nomads' horses shod. More important for transport purposes is the ass, which is patient of thirst and need only be watered every second day. The Sulubba have no other beasts, yet cross with impunity waterless regions which the Bedouins with their dhulul do not lightly pass. Asses are said to stand the sharp stones of harrah desert better than camels, and for short routes of about forty miles may render useful service; a European traveller rode one between Hofuf and 'Oqair (see Route No. 11). In towns and villages donkeys are numerous and are commonly ridden in the large oases ; some kinds, such as the white breeds of Hasa and Mecca, have a more than local reputation. It has been stated, on exceptionally good local authority, that the good Mecca donkey can go from Jiddah to Mecca (50 miles at least) in from six to seven hours, whereas an envoy from Ruweis, mounted on a good dhelul, in 1916 took nine hours for practically the same distance, from Ruweis (4 miles N. of Jiddah) to Mecca. The mule is less frequently seen than the ass. Mules carried litters on the pilgrims route from Damascus in 1876, and were observed raising water on the same route, yoked to the duldb or well-machine. • The Camel Trade of Arabia The camel-breeding tribes in Arabia are as follows : In the North, the Ruweilah, Fed'an, 'Amarat, and Siba'. These tour Anazah tribes are by far the most famous breeders, and their nerds are larger than those of any other part of the desert. The Huweitat rear camels, but in smaller numbers.

Of these the most-renowned camel breeders are the Qahtan, though they cannot rival the Anazah. Some of the Harb, the sub-tribes of the Beni Salim, and the Beni 'Ali are camel owners. In Eastern Arabia, the Muteir, the 'Ajman, to a lesser extent the Dhafir and the Murrah. The Manasir, south of the Murrah on the edge of the great sand desert, have few camels and are seldom seen by the merchants of the QasTm. The camels of Oman, like those of Aden (see above, p, 14), are to a great extent absorbed by local requirements. The camel trade has its centre in Damascus, where almost all the capital is supplied. The principal merchants were, in 1914, Mohammed el-Bassam, a native of the Qasim, who held half the trade in his hands, Yasim edh-Dhiyab, Suwwah, Ibn Rawwaf, and 'Abdullah Haleisi. These bring yearly into Damascus 300-400 ra'iyahs, i. e. 24,000—32,000 camels. There are one or two dealers in Baghdad, such as 'Assafi and Da'ud ibn Juweili, but these handle a much smaller number of beasts. They buy from the tribes near the 'Iraq, chiefly from the Shammar and the 'Amarat, and sell in Damascus, where alone there is any market. About 300 camels are sold in Aleppo every Wednesday for six months in the year. These are mostly from the Siba' and Fed'an, but some come from the smaller people in the Jebel el-Hass and the Euphrates valley. Most of the beasts are driven from Aleppo straight over the Amanus into Asia Minor, but a few go south to Hamah for Damascus. The dealers of Damascus and Baghdad employ as buyers men of the 'Uqeil. In the days when the strong hand of Mohammed ibn Rashid kept the desert under control, a number of Damascenes used to go out and buy from the tribes ; but when he died. Central and Western Arabia became so turbulent that caravans could no longer pass through them with any degree of safety, and the well- known Ma'rawi family are now almost the only Damascenes em ployed as buyers. The 'Uqeil are all Nejd Arabs, townsfolk, or nomads chiefly from the Qasim, but always chosen from among tribes such as the settled Beni Tamim, who are not engaged in interminable blood-feuds with other tribal groups. They are the recognized guides and conductors of caravans in Arabia, an organi zation partaking of the nature of a club and a benefit society, with a president who is always a native of Boreidah and head-quarters at Baghdad. But though men of the Qasim carry on all the dealings with the tribes, they do it on behalf of the merchants of Damascus or Baghdad ; there is no one in the Qasim with sufficient capital arabia 11 -rIl ls METHODS OF TRANSPORT to set up indefinitely, nor would he be in touch with the foreign markets. In Central Arabia the trade is conducted from the Qasim. The ^Uqeil buy camels at the beginning of the summer, after the harvest, and towards the end of the summer when the Bedouins need money to provide themselves with clothes and provisions for autumn and winter. There is a complete cessation of the trade during the winter. The Arabs are not in need of money, for they have laid in their winter stock of clothes and provisions, and they prefer to reserve their camels for breeding and for milk. Moreover, there is no difficulty in feeding them after the first winter rains have fallen in November. The 'Uqeil go out to the Qahtan and the Ateibah, but they buy the Dawasir, Murrah, and Muteir camels in the Hasa. They bring in their purchases to the Qasim district and keep them out at pasture during the winter. In the early spring they drive them north to the springs of Hazil and across the Hamad, either by Jauf or by more direct lines over the desert. They take rafiqs (guides and sureties) from the great Sheikhs of the Anazah, from Ibn Hadhdhal, Ibn Sha'lan, Ibn Mijlad, Ibn Muheid, Ibn Dughmi, or Ibn Murshid, and cross the desert in complete security, travelling slowly and letting the camels pasture as they go. The journey to Damascus takes about two months. They bring the camels either to Damascus and so down into Egypt, or in small numbers across Sinai. The few Damascenes who buy from Central Arabia come down across the Nefud to the Shammar, the Wuld Suleiman, and the 'Abdah (these two last have not, however, many camels) and return by the same road, taking a Shammar rafiq with them. The largest number of camels come from the Anazah. Like the Nejd camels, they are bought in the summer when prices are lowest, and the same 'Uqeili who has come up from Nejd with his two or three ra'iyahs in the early summer, may be employed to buy from the Anazah in the neighbourhood of Damascus. He will go down to the Jaulan or to the Eastern Belqa near Qasr el-Azraq, where the Ruweilah are to be found, or to the pasturages round Homs and Hamah, to buy from the Hasanah and the Siba'. The Fed'an must be followed into the Jezirah, where they camp in summer in the Khabur valley ; the 'Amarat are mostly on the Euphrates near Museyyib at that season. The purchasing of camels is done through one of the Sheikhs ; the 'Uqeil buyer lives in his tent and the Sheikh sees that the animals are delivered at a fair price. In return for his help and protection he receives a riydl on every camel purchased. A Sheikh who attempts to raise his fee runs the risk of losing his custom, and unless he has sufficient authority with his people to16 Joreign am, The harvest, ed money tumn and Ming the 'Ve laid in prefer to r, there is ave fallen !

The Huweitat are in bad odour on this account. A Sheikh will not willingly sell to any but his own buyer, lest in a succeeding year he should lose his market. He prefers the man he knows and has harboured yearly. The price of camels has more than doubled during the last fifteen or twenty years. The average price is now £T8 a head, the expenses of the journey come to another £T1, and the camel is sold in Damascus for £T10, leaving a profit of £T1. The ultimate market is Egypt, which takes an average of 32,000 camels yearly. The Egyptian Government raises a duty on every camel entering the country, and the number of imported camels is therefore accurately registered. This figure represents the whole of the yearly camel trade with the exception of 7,000-8,000 beasts sent every year to Asia Minor, and a smaller demand both for food and for agricultural purposes from Syria, Mesopotamia, and Ara- bistan, which may be put at about 5,000 camels annually. There is no camel trade through the Hejaz ; the mountainous character of the country makes it unsuitable for camel traffic. The tribes between the Qahtan district and the Hejaz, Sebei', Shalawah, and Buqum, are sheep-breeders. The tribes along the coast, Juheinah, Billi, and 'Atiyah, do not rear camels ; they keep them only in sufficient quantities for their own transport purposes and for milk. Nor are the Harb on the coast camel-breeders. The Ahamda, one of their principal sub-tribes, are camel-drivers and carry on the transport trade between Mecca, Medina, and the sea. It would be impossible to arrive at an accurate estimate of the camels in Arabia, but a rough approximation based on Arab figures may be attempted. The herds of the Northern Anazah, who are the tribes richest in camels, may amount to as much as 300,000 head. This would include breeding-camels and those not yet fit for service. (A camel is not reckoned fit for full work until it is six years old, and its best years are from six to twelve.) The Shammar of Jebel Shammar may have about 80,000. The herds of the Emir himself do not number much more than 1,000. The Muteir have 60,000-70,000; the Dhafir 20,000-30,000 ; .but all authorities agree that the Qahtan are exceptionally rich in camels, and their herds may run to 100,000 head, or even more. The Emir Ibn Sa'ud, who draws his supplies chiefly from the Qahtan, Dawasir, Muteir, Sebei', and Sahul, is said to have 4,000 good riding-camels. The Ateibah are not so renowned as the Qahtan for camel-breeding, but their numbers cannot be much under 80,000. The Harb must be estimated at about 50,000 to 60,000, the Sukhur and the Huweitat at 20,000 and b 220 METHODS OF TRANSPORT 10,000 respectively. The 'Iraq yields no camels. The Munt.efiq and the tribes along the two rivers are cultivators ; few of them own camels even for agricultural purposes, their live-stock consisting ot sheep and goats. The Duleim are sheep-breeders and supply the Damascus market. The Shammar of the Jezirah are said not to have more than about 10,000 camels ; their Sheikhs remain fairly stationary within small areas, whereas the owner of great camel herds must be continuously on the move. The Kurdish tribes of the northern Jezirah rear flocks of sheep and are visited by the Damascene sheep buyers every spring ; but they are not camel owners. At this estimate the herds of the tribes, who are the prin cipal breeders, come to 720,000 head, and beyond this figure a margin must be allowed for the tribes who breed in small numbers, and contribute irregularly to the Syrian market. These figures can be checked by a calculation based on the number of camels which come annually into the market. It must be borne in mind that the Bedouins sell only their surplus. During the spring and early summer nomad Arabia lives principally on the milk of the camel, and it has no other means of transport. The best riding-camels, the dhulul, are always females, and are not allowed to breed. Thus Arabia exports annually : To Egypt 32,000 To Asia Minor .... 7,500 To Mesopotamia^ Arabistan • • • 5,000 Syria ) 44,500 Using the figures supplied by the Egyptian Government statistics on camel-breeding, an annual surplus of 44,500 camels implies a total of 750,000 head in the herds of Arabia. This figure corre sponds well with the figure given from native information, namely 720,000 plus the herds of the smaller tribes, and may be taken as a working basis for calculations relating to the possible supply of camels from Arabia. It would be exceedingly difficult for the Ottoman Government to alter materially the established course of the camel trade. For example, to purchase through Ibn Rashid any considerable number of camels would be almost impossible since the trade is in the hands of the 'Uqeil, and the Sheikhs would not willingly deal with other buyers. Even if Ibn Rashid were to sell Shammar camels to the Ottoman Government, Ibn Sha'lan, the paramount Sheikh of the great Ruweilah Confederation, would probably hold them up as they crossed the Hamad; and there is no other road by which they could be bro numbers via Aleppo, woul the difficulty is always sea tie camel bK unwillingness bordering on fetween Turl camels shoul kastily settle* tte centre of the Wadi Sirl last heard of, had penetrate The Turks co: Dhiyab, well- and purchase heartedly, at in the attack unsuitable fc them were advantage of short of read] that of ordin but, so far as the Turks me transport for f to Central Ara still holding I should be eneoTHE CAMEL TRADE OF ARABIA 21 could be brought into Syria. An attempt to take camels in large numbers via Diarbekr or even up the Euphrates, and so direct to Aleppo, would not meet with success. The journey is too long, and the difficulty of feeding the camels on the way too great. Pasturage is always scanty along frequented roads. The Ruweilah, who are the camel breeders nearest to the Syrian frontier, have shown great unwillingness to sell to the Turks. In common with other tribes bordering on Syria, their chief anxiety since the outbreak of war between Turkey and Great Britain seems to have been lest their camels should be commandeered for military purposes. They hastily settled their differences with one another and retired into the centre of the Hamad. The Sukhur and the Huweitat crossed the Wadi Sirhan and took refuge in Ibn Sha'lan's country. When last heard of, in 1915, they were east of 'Amud, in the Wadyan, and had penetrated as far east as Mat and Ibn Hadhdhal's pasturages. The Turks commissioned Mohammed Bassam, Ibn Rawwaf, and Ibn Dhiyab, well-known Damascene buyers, to send out to the Ruweilah and purchase from them, but the attempt was made very half heartedly, and the results were next to nothing. The camels used in the attack on the Canal, in 1915, were procured in Syria and were unsuitable for a desert campaign ; consequently the losses among them were heavy. At the present time it is possibly to the advantage of the Ottoman Government that the Bedouins must be short of ready money and that the surplus of camels must be double that of ordinary years, since there was no selling done in 1914 ; but, so far as our information goes, it points to the conclusion that the Turks met with no less difficulty in 1916 in providing camel transport for Sinai and sought vainly to meet the need by applying to Central Arabian Sheikhs. It seems likely that the Anazah are still holding back in their eastern pasturages, an attitude which should be encouraged.CHAPTER II COMMUNICATIONS There are no made roads, cut, embanked, metalled and bridged, in Arabia, except in the Aden district and on the line Hodeidah- San'a. The,great majority of the tracks of communication follow natural contours, picking the easiest way round or over rocks, sand-billows, ravines, &amp;c. Their course is determined by the situation of water, where this is accessible. Certain lines of com munication have been made feasible by provision of wells or cisterns. The latter were constructed in early times along all main pilgrim- tracks, but they have largely been allowed to go to ruin ; _ and it must always be borne in mind that wells and springs, in such a country as Arabia, are often found dry, choked, or fouled by the carelessness of the Bedouins in watering animals. Where lines of communication cross open steppe country, which, from the occurrence of hilly patches (such as the Harrahs) within it or on its edges, has ground-water at accessible depths, Bedouins will range widely and dig wells for camping centres all over the district. The communication tracks will then be multiple, not necessarily keeping to one direct line | and two different parties proceeding from one end of the route to the other may follow quite different tracks, or cross and recross each other's line, in progress from camp to camp of Bedouins at the pleasure or convenience of their guides or rajlqs. The route-schemes adopted are therefore subject to much variation in actual experience in such regions (e. g. on the Ateibah Steppes between Mecca and Qasim), and must be taken only as general guides of direction along possible tracks. The different main Routes are set out schematically in the following chapter. We shall deal with them here only generally and in groups, as they converge on certain centres, retaining the same order and describing their general character and the nature of their supplies. A. NORTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 1-7) These are all more or less desert-tracks, that is, they must cross at some stage or stages enough steppe or sheer desert to render itNORTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 1-7) 23 necessary, or at least prudent, to carry water for man and beast for more than a day's journey. But only one of them is rendered dangerously difficult by natural causes, namely No. 1 (Jauf to Hail via Jubbah), on which continuous deep nefudh sand, with no possibility of water, must be traversed from four to six days. Here a mistake of direction or a breakdown might easily involve a party in destruction. Curiously enough, however, this road is the one which has been followed most often by European travellers, the reason being that, up to about 1890, provision of water on the much easier route from Jauf, No. 2 (via Hayyaniyah), had not been secured. It was only after the Emir Mohammed of Ha'il had cleaned out, and fortified with a block-house, the Hayyaniyah wells, and at the same time curbed the tendency of the Anazah and Dhafir tribes to raid this part of the northern desert, that the eastern route, which nowhere encounters any very broad or deep sand-belt, came into favour. The quickest and easiest route from Syria to Central Arabia is, of course, by the Hejaz Railway to Qal'at el-Mu'adhdham (Route No. 20), or some point south of it. The Mu'adhdham route is that taken habitually by the couriers of the Emir of Ha'il, who cover the distance from the capital to the railway in three stages on their fast dromedaries. From Meda'in Salih, El-'Ala or Hadiyah (via Kheibar) Qasim can be reached almost as quickly. If this railway be not utilized, the points of departure are either Jau£ el-'Amr or a settlement in the lower Euphrates valley, prefer ably Nejef, Samawah, or Suq esh-Shuyukh, the last being least in favour owing to danger from the uncontrolled Dhafir and Muteir tribesmen. From no points lower down the valley or along the Shatt el-'Arab is there any but a very difficult direct track to Ha'il. Apart from the human dangers just mentioned, the south-eastern corner of the Northern Desert presents special difficulties of relief and intricate and irregular dune-formations. From these points the tracks converge on one or other of two urban centres in the Centre, Ha'il or Boreidah. The latter lies to the south east of the former, but caravans do not necessarily pass through Ha'il to reach it. All these routes are possible for the passage of regular armed forces of moderate size, if special arrangements have been made for their transport and supply on the way, except probably the Jauf- Jubbah-Ha'il route, which lies for four to six days through deep waterless nefud. For example, over the Darb es-Selman and Darb24 COMMUNICATIONS Zobeidah routes from Samawah and Nejef to Ha'il (see below, p. 26 f.) Turkish columns have twice marched comparatively recently (1903 and 1905). On the first occasion 2,000 men, and on the second six battalions got through to Ha'il and beyond. But it should be observed that, on each occasion, they had been invited by the Emir of Ha'il, who provided guidance and transport. Without these facilities (still more, had the Emir actively opposed) the result would, in all likelihood, have been different. The distance from Samawah to Ha'il was covered by Ahmed Feizi's force (late winter, 1905) in about three weeks. Supplies. It goes almost without saying that, under ordinary circumstances, supplies are unprocurable on every one of these routes, except at their starting and arrival points. As for food stuffs, animals for killing might be obtained from herdsmen near the tracks, if the passage were made in spring. Forage, except such as camels can eat, is equally non-existent. The only fuel is afforded by sparse and low bush vegetation in the desert hollows, and a comparatively small party would soon exhaust a considerable area round its camp. Water, except immediately after rain, when khabrahs (pools) might be met with, is everywhere scanty and diffi cult of access. The only intermediate wells yielding a sufficient supply for more than a small party are those at Jubbah, Hayyaniyah, Hazil, Shaqiq, L5qah, Leinah, and others within a radius of seventy miles from Ha'il. (i) Routes from Jauf In addition to those set out in detail, there is a direct track across the Nefud to Teima ; but since it crosses much heavy sand, has never been traversed by a European, and is, apparently, not much used, it is not described among our Routes. In common with Route No. 1, it is rendered unsafe at present by predatory Huteim during the only seasons when it could be travelled without great suffering. On the general character of Route No. 1 (from Jauf to Ha'il via Jubbah), see above. Its track lies mainly across the Nefud and is very trying and tedious owing to the constant ascents and descents of the billowy dunes and gigantic horse-hoof hollows, characteristic of this region, and to the long detours which have frequently to be made in avoiding the larger and sandier of them. The undulations for the most part are covered with deep and loose sand, in which the animals' feet often sink very low. These the Bedouins of the district call by the name felj, or felq, and qa'r, plurs. fuluj, fuluq, qu'ur (see also Vol. I, Chap. XII).11 (see 1%, C0ni paiatkel; ^ men^k ■ ail( l koi hUk ail dtra!i8jicit opp^j iifierent, if Ahmed Feia; fflfe oiiait 1 one of i® • As{or|((i. herdsmen® Foratji eip ■he only lid 3 desert kits t a considers liter rain, 4 icantyandi ling a sici; ihiHayyapt adiiofseraj rect track» heavy aiiik lently^otmi imonmtlilit f Huteim te t great sdti' NORTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 1-7) 25 Supplies. Wafer was formerly reported as sufficient at Jauf and Shaqiq and again onward from Jubbah, but in the long stage across the Nefud, between Shaqiq and Jubbah, it has always been unob tainable. Dried ' ghadha' and ' yerta' bush (the latter a kind of thickly-matted wild-vine) make excellent fuel and are abundant all the way across the Nefud. Fodder for camels and sheep is also very abundant and varied and includes a kind of grass known as ' nassi' and in particular a plant called ' 'adaron which it is said that sheep can feed for a month without water. At Jauf and Ha'il a certain amount of live-stock, poultry, and fruit would be available. Since it is now reported that the settlement in the Jubbah oasis, which alone rendered this line of approach practicable for caravans, has decayed and is abandoned (possibly owing to encroachment of sand), the route has probably passed almost out of use. On the other hand Route No. 2 (from Jauf to Hayyaniyah and so to Ha'il or Boreidah) is now constantly taken, and it appears, from Shakespear's account of his journey in 1914 from Hayyaniyah to Jauf, to be surprisingly free from deep or broad sand-belts. Between Jauf and Hayyaniyah it is necessary to carry water for three days, but to a well-equipped party the track threatens no danger. It keeps too far eastward for the Huteim to trouble it seriously, while it is too far westward for the Dhafir raiders. Since, however, Jauf has passed out of the hands of the Emir of Ha'il into those of theRuweilah chief, his hereditary foe, transit is less frequent and security less assured between Jauf and Ha'il than was the case before 1910. At Hayyaniyah, Nolde saw great numbers of Ruweilah; Shake- spear found the fort at the wells occupied by a small post of the Emir of Ha'il's men. It should be noted that the section from Hayyaniyah to Ha'il is described under Route No. 4, with the closing stages of which (from Hayyaniyah onwards) it corresponds. Route No. 2 is continued from Hayyanivah direct to Boreidah. The route skirts the E. side of the Nefud, crossing projecting tongues of it, as between Qasr el-Adhfa and Hayyaniyah, and series of sand-ridges, as at 20 miles beyond Bir Zerud. Except at the two last-named places, halts are optional, as there are no villages nor settlements between the neighbourhood of Jauf and that of Boreidah. For about 100 miles between Jauf and Qasr el-Adhfa, the way lies in or along an extensive wadi continuous with the Khubb Labbah ; it seems possible that this valley may be connected with the great26 COMMUNICATIONS Wadi el-Khar which runs into the Bahr en-Nejef, for Leachman was told that the Wadi el-Khar had its head ' near Lubbe in the Nefud near Janf At mile 260, some 63 miles beyond Hayyaniyah, the track crosses the Darb Zobeidah, and at mile 356 the route from Samawah to Boreidah. Nolde's route from Jauf to Hail took a more direct course across the Nefud. Supplies. There is no water between Howah (Hoa) or Shaqiq and the wells of Hazam el-Mai near the 110th mile. After this there is another long interval of about 90 miles before Hayyaniyah wells are reached ; this is followed by a third waterless tract between these wells and the Bir Zerud. 'After Zerud there are wells on or near the route at distances of about 40 miles or less. There is sufficient grazing for camels along the route, but no food-supplies. (ii) Routes from the Euphrates Valley {a) From Nejef or Samawah There are three recognized routes between Neje£ and Jebel Shammar. The best known, although no longer the most frequented, is the Darb Zobeidah (Route No. 3), which runs due south to Birkat ez- Zebalah (Zobalah), and thence slightly west to the wells of Sha'ibah, skirting the edge of the true Nefud, but crossing a few tongues of sand which extend eastwards from the main sand-bed. Here the track divides—south-eastwards to Boreidah, and westwards to Ha'il. Huber accomplished this journey in 35 days, but remarked that it could easily be done in 12 days. The Blunts took 22 days' actual travelling, but were much hindered by the Hajj, which they accompanied. There is a continuous series of tanks and wells, but in spite of this the route has fallen into disuse. Even in Huber's time (1884) he had to confess that the pilgrims were unable to make use of the route which had been especially constructed for them. The rains are not sufficient to fill the reservoirs, and therefore the more direct and safer track by L5qah and Hayyaniyah is the favourite one. Apart from the question of water, the Darb Zo beidah presents few physical difficulties for camel transport except at the Jal el-Batn and possibly along the sections where intermittent tongues of the Nefud have to be crossed. The line followed is subject to deviations according to the season and political circum stances. It should be added that there is an alternative route which diverges from the Darb Zobeidah about 40 miles S. of Nejef, and, running by the wells of Selman and Leinah, rejoins the Darb Zobeidah at Khadhra.g NORTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 1-7) 27 Supplies. For water, see above. In full summer and autumn all supplies must be carried from the starting-point; but fuel and fodder are generally found along the track in sufficient quantities for small caravans. Both the Hajj and the food-caravans bound for Ha'il now follow the track via Hayyaniyah (Route No. 4, from Nejef to Ha'il) in pre ference to the Darb Zobeidah, on account of its directness and greater safety from raiders. The line followed lies about 40 miles to the west of the Darb Zobeidah ; the total distance is about 357| miles. It runs through grazing grounds, which from mid-winter to early summer are occupied by the Shammar tribes ; while during spring and summer the half-settled Shiah tribes, who own cultivated land and mud villages on the Euphrates, descend to the desert to pasture their sheep and donkeys as far south as 120 miles from Nejef. Thus only the first stages from Nejef are sometimes insecure, while for travellers authorized by the Shammar it may be regarded as a safe road. The track lies over good hard desert, except for the 50-mile wide belt of Nefud, which is crossed during the last few stages. The average altitude is between 1,000 ft. and 2,000 ft. The country rises to 1,000 ft. above sea-level about 4 days to the south of Nejef ; half-way to Ha'il it is 2,000 ft., rising slowly to 2,500 ft. on the southern edge of the Nefud, and suddenly lifting to 3,500 ft. at Ha'il. As far as the Batn the country is a featureless region of stony flats and shallow ridges through which winds the Wadi Hisb. The stony desert of Hajarah, which follows, has an ill repute on account of loose sharp stones liable to lame camels ; but travellers do not always note this feature. The eastern part of Nefud which the route crosses is less difficult than the western half ; the sand is seldom deep, while the track is well marked. No part of the road is metalled, and, like other desert routes, it is impassable for camels after rain, except where it crosses sand. Lying between the Darb Zobeidah and the track via Bir Samit and Hazil, the route appears to be the most direct track between Nejef and Ha'il. Supplies. Water is not plentiful. Along the northern part of the route the presence of shepherds in the Batn and the Wadi Hisb suggests that accessible pools must lie off the route between the regular watering-places. At these, with the exception of L5qah, there is only sufficient water for quite small parties. Although the permanent wells along this route are very scanty, there are khabrahs, or rain-pools, varying in number and extent according to the season. Water lies in shallow bottoms on the southern edge of the28 COMMUNICATIONS Nefud, along the Wadi el-Khad and its tributaries, in certain muddy channels known as the Jawarid, about 50 miles north of the Batn, and in the Wadi Hisb. Such supplies as these are exhausted in summer. The permanent watering-places are -L/oqali, Hayya- niyah, Tayyim, and Jeithaniyah. In winter there is sufficient camel-grazing all along the route. In full summer all food-supphes must be carried from the starting-point; but in winter and spring fresh meat can be obtained from the herds. One other route has been followed between Nejef and Ha'il, namely that taken by Wallin in 1848. This track (Route No. 5) leads from Nejef direct to the wells of Hazil, more or less following the course of Wadi Hisb. Thence one passes to Ha'il, without touching at Hayyaniyah, the total journey taking 15-16 days. It is a desert route, and, after leaving the region of the Euphrates, crosses the stony Hajarah desert for many days, and afterwards the eastern side of the Nefud. Fixed points for camping are deter mined only by the rare wells, and intermediate halting-places are optional. In Wallin's time the route was supposed to be safer than the more easterly Darb Zobeidah, and to be used by peaceful caravans. Wallin noted the presence of Huteim at Bir Tayyim, in the summer ; and Leachman states that the 'Amarat clan of the Anazah frequent the wells of Hazil. The same traveller met, at Bir Samit, Madan Arabs from the Euphrates, who are apt to be better armed than Bedouins, and in so far may be a greater danger to caravans. In June 1912, Hazil was the scene of a successful attack on the Shammar by the Ruweilah Anazah, who killed 23 men. This route appears to be the Darb el-Ghazal, though according to Leachman no such name is now familiar to the Arabs. Supplies. There are long intervals between the wells, and except after rains, water cannot be relied upon between Bir Samit and Bir Hazil (111 miles), or between Bir Hazil and Bir 'Atwa (95 miles). Fuel and camel-grazing are obtainable in most places. Food-sup plies are not available between Nejef and Ha'il. The track from Samawah to Boreidah, which is known as the Darbes-Selman as far as Leinah, is here described as Route No. 6. This route presents few exceptional difficulties, but runs for the most part over different kinds of desert, passing no place with settled inhabitants throughout the 309 miles between Samawah and Quseibah. Bedouins may be encountered at Leinah, Zubiri, and Jufrah (Gofra), and probably at other wells ; and the closing stagehi iret ^ Eairi. vtut days, It lie Eupbte, BirTapj twa (9o riei iitnuta^ no plate fill feen San®^ NORTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 1-7) 29 from 'Ayun el-Qasim to Boreidah, which is traversed also by Route No. 15 (see p. 35), may be far from secure. The going is heavy for laden camels while crossing the sand-dunes in the first stage after Leinah, and again between Zubiri and Hubiiri. The loose stones on the Hajarah desert and the Teisiyah plain are likely to lame camels. Supplies. Water at the first and third stages is of indifferent quality, and at the second, fourth, and fifth stages the supply depends upon rain. Leachman believes the Hajarah desert as a whole to be well provided. At Leinah the water is so abundant that the wells are said by the Dhafir to yield enough for their whole tribe. There seem to be four waterless stages between Leinah and ZubTri, and two between that place and Hubiri, where the supply is again dependent upon recent rain. It is not till Quseibah that abundant wells are once more reached, after which there is no further difficulty. Fuel and camel- grazing are described as scarce in the early stages, but sufficient after Leinah. The Nefud tracts furnish abundance, as also the wadi beds in the Teisiyah plain. Provisions in any quantity are not obtainable between Samawah and 'Ayun (pop. 4,000). Transport animals other than camels are owned in numbers by the tribes about Samawah. All these last routes are subject to Dhafir and other raids, and are less safe in their early stages from the Euphrates valley than after the Shammar dira is reached. (6) From Silq esh-Shuyulch The track from Suq esh-Shuyukh to Ha'il, which is here described as Route No. 7, leaves the Euphrates at Suq esh-Shuyukh and, after traversing a gravelly desert through the dira of the Muntefiq and that of the Dhafir Arabs, reaches Leinah on the border of the Nefud. It then crosses a tongue of the Nefud to Bir Beleghbiyah, whence it follows the Darb Zobeidah, or Persian Pilgrim route, to Ha'il (Route No. 3). Supplies. The route is possible for camel transport. Water is obtainable except for four stages between Qasr Bir Shaghrah and Bir Arkamiyah, and for two stages between Bir Unsab and Bir Umm 'Amarah. Fuel and fodder are plentiful, especially between Bir Arkamiyah and Bir Beleghbiyah, though in summer the fodder is parched. General supplies are only obtainable at Suq esh-Shuyukh and at Ha'il.,30 COMMUNICATIONS B. EASTERN ROUTES (Nos. 8-14) Of those making for the Centre, one group starts from Zobeir (Basra) or Koweit, and goes to Boreidah, and by divergence to the right, near Zilfi, to Shaqrah or Riyadh. The other group starts from ports on the midway shore of the Persian Gulf. Qatif or 'Oqair, and troes in the first place to the Hasa Oasis, and thence to Riyadh. A direct route also connects Koweit and Riyadh, but, though followed by Pelly in 1865, it is not much used, owing to the length of the waterless stages to be covered and the lack of camps along its line. Further there are link-routes between Koweit, Hasa, and Qatif. The line Zobeir (or Koweit)-Boreidah is of great importance as a section of the chief trans-peninsula route, which starts from Mecca or Medina and traverses Qasim. For the passage both of trade and (in less degree) of pilgrims no other cross-Arabian track compares with it. The eastern section is rendered passable by the Batin depression—the lower course of Wadi Rummah—which offers a line of deep, but possible, wells for nearly 300 miles. In the first third of it, owing to the larger rainfall of the Gulf littoral, not only are these wells to be relied on, but also watering-plaees are scattered thickly over a wide area to the south of the Batin, and therefore cross-routes come into it, at such points as Riqa'i, Hafar, and Ajibbah. But, owing to the uncertainty of the wells along the line, stages have not been defined so precisely on Routes Nos. 8 and 9 as on other Arabian routes. (i) Routes from Zobeir and Koweit to the Centre These are all subject to raids by the Muteir, and if there is active war between this tribe and the Shammar of Ibn Rashid, they are very unsafe. In their latest stages they come within range also of the Ateibah, who are particularly to be feared in Sedeir. The tribes of the Gulf littoral (Beni Khalid, 'Ajman, &amp;c.) are seldom found in force so far north. Route No. 8, from Zobeir to Boreidah, joins that from Koweit to Boreidah (Route No. 9) at Riqa'i, and the section common to them both, from Riqa'i to Boreidah, is described under the latter route. It will suffice here to note that the section from Zobeir to Riqa'i, as a camel-track, presents no important physical obstacles. Halting- places are optional, since there are neither wells nor important camping-grounds. Supplies. There is no water between Zobeir and Riqa'i, at whichEASTERN ROUTES (Nos. 8-14) 31 place there is only a scanty supply after rain. There is enough camel-grazing for a small caravan ; fuel is scanty. There are no food supplies along the track. Route No. 9, from Koweit to Boreidah, presents no serious diffi culties. Shakespear maintained an average of about 3 m. an hour ; even when crossing Dahanah, he did not fall below 2f m. The course of the Batin is clearly defined, its breadth varying from 2 m. at Riqa'i to more than twice as much at Hafar ; its banks are highest between Burj esh-Sherif and Qulban Ibn Towala, where they resemble cliffs. After Ajibbah, the Batin is left for a straight track to Boreidah across nefiid, stony plain and desert. The route passes no places with settled inhabitants between Jahrah and 'Ain Ibn Faheid, running for about 300 m. through lonely country without obvious camping-grounds other than the best-known wells, such as Hafar or Thamamiyah. Halts are there fore optional over a great part of the route, and even before the Batin is reached camps cannot be indicated for every day. In the Batin, between Riqa i and Hafar, and in the long stretch between Hafar and Ajibbah, the convenience of the day's march decides the halting-place ; in this stretch, Shakespear camped six times. Supplies. After Jahrah, no food nor supplies are obtainable before the village of Ain Ibn Faheid, towards the end of the journey. Water is obtainable at frequent intervals, and it is seldom that a stage is passed without a well. After rain, pools form in many places, and remain for about a week ; in February 1910, Shake spear s progress along this route was twice delayed by heavy rain. Except over a few stretches, there is enough camel-grazing for a small caravan. Fuel is sufficient after Haleibah. In Route No. 10, from Koweit to Zilfi, there are no great physical obstacles, for where the Dahanah zone is crossed it is only about 15 m. wide. There is often no defined track, so that it is necessary to travel with a good Bedouin guide. The route passes no villages ; as wells are very few, the choice of camping-grounds is arbitrary, and it is difficult to indicate daily stages. Raunkiaer, travelling at about 2f m. an hour, occupied 107 hours, camping fifteen times between Koweit and Zilfi ; his total distance must be about 300 miles. As given by Lorimer and Indian Govt. Rd. Bk., the distance,via Subeihi- yah wells, is 283 m., but these authorities describe the Summan zone as crossed in one day's journey SW. of Safah, whereas Raunkiaer took more than twice as long. The route is considered comparatively safe, but Raunkiaer paid a tax to the Muteir at Koweit for the use ■32 COMMUNICATIONS of the wells, a representative of the tribe remaining with him as far as Jau ez-Zor. At Artawlyah a settlement of Bedouins is said to have been established within the last ten years, and Raunkiaer did not think it advisable to camp near the wells. Raunkiaer's mention of a cairn over a pilgrim's grave at Rejim shows that the route must have been used occasionally by pilgrims from Koweit to Mecca, by Boreidah. At Safah it is joined by tracks NW. to Hafar, and SW. to Mejma'. At about 15 m. SW. of Artawlyah, another track runsS. into Sedeir. Shakespear, travelling from Koweit in 1910, must have followed a course very near to that of Raunkiaer between the Shaqq valley and Safah. Supplies. After the first two stages from Koweit, water cannot be relied upon before Safah, a distance of more than 100 m., and an equally long interval without wells separates that place from Artawiyah ; it is therefore necessary to carry a supply sufficient for 4-5 days, though after rain various hollows collect water. Fuel is very scarce ; firewood should be carried while crossing the Qara waste, and after leaving Safah. Grazing is fair during the initial stages, but absent in Qara'. It is sufficient about Safah, and is found in hollows in the Summan zone, as also about Safiyah, Arta wiyah, and Sebillah. No regular food supplies are obtainable between Koweit and Zilfi, but Raunkiaer observed gazelles and numerous hares in the district of Qara', and truffles were abundant both here and in the Dibdibah. The same traveller notes that the Beni 'Abdullah drive their goats across the Dahanah zone into Summan. (ii) Routes from l Oqair and Qatlf to the Centre These afford the shortest and easiest passage into Nejd. Regular troops of Ibrahim Pasha traversed this stretch with guns in 1818-19, and irregular Nejdean forces have imitated them on several occasions. The country crossed, however, is, or was till lately, conspicuously unsafe. Not only are the notorious Beni Hajar to be feared between Qatif and Hofuf, but west of the Hasa the desert is ranged by several tribes whose diras and rights to wells are in great confusion and eternal dispute. Consequently rafiqs have to be continually changed, and it is difficult to know, and often quite uncertain, what rafiq is to be taken to secure a party from molestation. The 'Ajman from the north, the Ahl Murrah from the south, and parties of Dawasir from the south-west, are the chief disputants, and of these the two last are reputed not to observe over strictly the Bedouin code in regard to rafiqs. Nothing but the strong overlordship of the Emir of Riyadh can guarantee a caravan.EASTERN ROUTES (Nos. 8-14) 33 After leaving the coastal tracts and the oases, Route No. 11, from Oqair, or Qatif, to Riyadh, resembles in its essential features Route JNIo. 10, crossing the two waterless deserts of Summan and Dahanah * it passes no places with settled inhabitants between Hofuf and Nejd. As has been already stated, attacks may sometimes be expected from Bedouins ('Ajman, Ahl Murrah, Beni Haiar, and JJawasir), who also camp in the neighbourhood of the wells at Ajafiyah. The country near Hofuf is reputed to be unsafe, and caravans between that town and the coast go armed. Supplies. At Hofuf and Qatif, grain, rice, sugar, fruits, and qhi m small quantities ; nothing between these places and Riyadh. Water cannot be obtained in the Summan and Dahanah zones and it ^ necessary to carry a five days' supply. The wells to the E. of the desert area, Judah and 'Aweisah, are described as yielding water m abundance. The same is the case with Abu Jifan on the W. side ; but the supply at Ajafiyah is not always ample, and the pools at Jalta Sadeiri are said to be at times exhausted. Between the W. an(i Riyadh' th 6 wells on the main route at Tarabi and Miyahiyah afford a regular supply. On the section Qatif-Hofuf, water is sufficient, but not of good quality. Between 'Oqair and Hofuf there is no scarcity by the longer route, except at Shatar ; on the direct route followed by Raunkiaer there are no wells. Fuel and fodder are scanty in the desert zones, and between the Hasa oasis and Wadi Faruq. (iii) Linking Coastal Routes The two preceding groups of routes are linked up by tracks from Koweit, which, running parallel to the coast, terminate at Hofuf and Qatif respectively ; these are described in this subsection. A third route connects Zobeir with Koweit, an easv track leading from Basra to the wells of Zobeir, which lie in steppe 10 miles from the town. From Zobeir there is a choice of two or three tracks leading over low plateau country, with abundant ground-water at from 5 to 12 feet below the surface, to the Gulf coast at Khutai (80 miles). At Umm Qasr, about half-way, is a small outpost station of the Sultan of Koweit. The first village on the shore with good water (not salt) is Jahrah, 14 miles farther, where the Sultan of Koweit keeps an outpost force. Route No. 12, from Koweit to Hofuf, traverses the Koweit districts of Adan, Salu , Hazeim, and Sudah, then the Hasa tracts of Rada'if, Wadi el-Miyah, Habl, and Jauf. The route to Qatif ARABIA II ^34 COMMUNICATIONS branches off at Inqair. The travelling is good, the surface being for the most part level and increasing in firmness after Salu . Supplies. Wafer is obtainable throughout, and usually plentiful; in the Hasa oasis it is abundant. Fuel is plentiful in the villages of the first stage, but scarce between Shi'aibah and Salu'. At Mazharah and Nta' (Anta') it is abundant, but, after this, rare except in the form of ghadha bushes and brushwood. Fodder is generally good, especially in spring. At Hofuf, small quantities of ghi, sugar, rice, dates, figs, citrons, and Arab clothing are obtainable. At Nta' there is a little wheat and barley ; there are camels, don keys, and cattle both here and at Sarrar. General supplies must be taken from Koweit. Route No. 13, from Koweit to Qatif, coincides with Route No. 12 as far as Inqair, and then traverses the Hasa tracts of Rada'if, Huzum, and Biyadh. It is a little-frequented track obviously inferior in convenience to the maritime route. There are no physical difficulties, and the surface is generally good. Supplies. Water good at the first stages, at Nta', and through out Biyadh ; abundant in the Qatif oasis. Fuel is scarce in Salu', and from Tareifah to the Qatif oasis, where it becomes plentiful. Fodder is usually sufficient for a small caravan, though scanty between Shi'aibah and Salu', and between Inqair and Tareifah. Food supplies must be taken from Koweit. Though Route No. 14, from Koweit to Zobeir, follows an unmade track, it is usually practicable for wheeled transport all the way to Zobeir and beyond to Basra ; but the section crossing the Mutla' pass, 3 miles N. of Jahrah, would require to be made for the passage of any considerable force, and the loose sand before the pass covered with brushwood or other suitable material. The coast-route via Qasr es-Sabiyah and Umm Qasr is cooler, but less adapted to wheel traffic. Supplies. Water abundant at Jahrah ; none between that place and Qash'aniyah, a distance of 47 miles ; a good supply 1 mile from Safwan. On the coast-route water is more plentiful, but, except at Sabariyah and Bahrah, of inferior quality. Fuel is scarce on the main route except at Jahrah and Rafidhiyah; on the coast- route there is sufficient for a small force. On both routes there is fair camel-grazing. No food-supplies between Jahrah and Zobeir by either route ; but at the latter place provisions are obtainable in moderate quantities. In the district of Dirhamiyah, a few miles to the SE. of it, live-stock, rice, maize, dates, and melons.^ 6 camcl^ don. Bontel.Uu Rada'Oiii in %i« WBS i; ont' CENTRAL ROUTES (Nos. 15 and 16) 35 C. CENTRAL ROUTES (Nos. 15 and 16) The Northern Routes, after converging on Ha'il, are continued into Qasim and South Nejd by a trunk-route (Route No. 15, from Ha'il to Riyadh) down the central axis of the Peninsula. This has been traversed wholly or in part by regular soldiery with guns on more than one occasion, e.g. from Ha'il to Qasim by Ahmed Feizi Pasha's expeditionary force in 1905, and from Qasim to Riyadh and beyond by Ibrahim Pasha's army in 1818 ; also, continually, by irregular forces of the rival Emirs of Ha'il and Riyadh. It presents no serious difficulties, traversing no moun tainous nor even hilly country, and, except on one two-day stage between 'Ayun es-Sirr and Woshm ('Ain el-Jareifah to Shaqrah), being supplied with watering places at convenient intervals. It lies, however, across much lean steppe and some desert, especially in its early stages, between Ha'il and 'Ayun el-Qasim, and between Qasim and Shaqrah. The latter stages, like the medial ones in Qasim, lie in oasis country. It is not, however, a great caravan route, like the cross-Peninsular track from west to east, the towns at its two ends, Ha'il and Riyadh, not being commercial centres or connected with the outer world by commercial routes : nor is it a pilgrim road. European travellers have seen all of it, except the first two stages from Ha'il; but Palgrave and Huber made so slight a deviation upon this short stretch, that we can trust their narratives for the general character of the country through which it lies. This route is comparatively safe from Bedouin raids throughout, unless the Emirs of Ha'il and Riyadh are at war. The least secure stages are that from 'Ayun el-Qasim to the neighbourhood of Boreidah, where both Muteir and Ateibah are possibly to be met, and that from Mudhnib to the neighbourhood of Shaqrah, where the Ateibah (Berqah section) penetrate not infrequently. For European or other Christian travellers it has, however, the special disadvantage of lying wholly in Wahabite territory, and necessitating a visit to the peculiarly fanatical town of Boreidah. Supplies. Foodstuffs in any bulk could be obtained en route only at Boreidah, Aneizah, and Shaqrah, and there they would be limited to dates, ghi, cereals in small quantity, fruits in season and small quantity, and animals for slaughter, the latter nowhere abundant. Nor could any of these towns supply many transport animals. The camel-breeding nomads must be relied on for these. Forage for equine animals would be unobtainable except in Qasim. c 236 COMMUNICATIONS Fuel would be very scanty except in the latter district and in Wadi Heisiyah-Hanifah. Water, as has been said, is fairly abundant except for two stages before Shaqrah is reached. But it is brackish or saline between Qasim and Ayun es-Sirr , not good at Boreidah ; and often brackish between the latter and Ha'il. The alternative track from Boreidah to Riyadh, here described_as Route No. 16, encounters a heavy sand desert between Wadi Rummah and Zilfi; but it is of no great breadth and contains oases. For the rest of the way the going is hard, and water is never far away. But the political conditions in Sedeir are always uncertain, allegiance being divided between the rival Emirs, and not well assured to either. Moreover, the people are fanatical. Except between Zilfi and Mejma', Bedouins (Ateibah) are not to be feared. Supplies. Foodstuffs would be unobtainable between Boreidah and Zilfi, but fairly abundant (on a small scale) on the rest of the route. Forage and fuel as on Route No. 15. D. WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 17-39) The presence of the goals of pilgrimage in the western hinter land causes tracks to converge upon it from all quarters. It alone among Arabian districts can be reached by railway (see Hejaz Railway, Route No. 17) from the outside world, and except for the settled districts of the south-west and south-east of the Peninsula, it alone has roads defended by any effective system of blockhouses. The points towards which all main tracks are directed are Medina and Mecca, but account must be taken also of some routes which make inland from the coast to the Hejaz Railway north of Medina, and of coastal linking routes to Yambo' and Jiddah. The tracks come from the centre (Ha'il, Qasim, or Riyadh) ; from the north (Syria and Egypt); from the west coast and from the south (Asir and Yemen). None of these reaches Mecca or Medina without crossing some desert and more steppe, and, except between Jiddah and Mecca, and along the coast line, all encounter hilly country and some difficult mountain passes. It should be noted that the routes from the Centre are here reversed in accordance with the plan of the Handbook. In general, the western routes are among the least safe in Arabia from nomad attack.WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 17-39) 37 of tie (i) The Hejaz Railway and North-Western Routes Hejaz Railway, which is described from Ma'an to Medina as f-05 metees (3 ft a 5 S ^ ?n l' 6 ^ ' gaUge throu ghout of V tr ®t ( ' , 5 34 h an &lt;i is not provided with sufficient sidmgs.

It was customary to change engines, and leave an intermediate at each of these points. A relay of drivers was carried. There fore, on the peace system, to maintain a daily service of one train each way would need about 15 locomotives. However good the present management, it will be found hard to economize on the old figure, since, apart from the unreliability of the machines, there will be interruptions by Arab raids, which may even make running by night inadvisable. The gauge being 1-05 m., the carrying capacity of the railway was never great. It is now working on wood-fuel, which has to be carried down from Damascus. A single train, during the 2,610 km. of the round trip, will burn nearly 50 tons of wood, which is a serious item in the gross load of the line. The average length of train was 13 trucks : the sidings are capable of 20, but even under present exigencies this limit is not likely to be reached, as the experience of the Syrian railways on wood-fuel seems to have compelled the management to run light trains. It has been customary sometimes in summer to take four tank-wagons on the train, for the machines and passengers, and to supply the waterless guard-posts and stations along the line. If the threat of Arab raids necessitates increasing these local garrisons and patrols, the net delivery of the line at Medina will be still further reduced. Supplies. Water is obtainable at the stations, but at most it only suffices for the requirements of the railway ; it is fairly abundant at Ma'an, Dhat el-Hajj, Tebuk, Qal'at el-Akhdhar, and El-'Ala. The most suitable places for rest camps would be Ma'an, Tebuk, and El-'Ala; but supplies in any quantity are not available en route. Route No. 18, from Akaba to Jauf via Ma'an, is a portion of a supposed ancient trade route between Egypt and the Persian42 COMMUNICATIONS Gulf. For practical purposes, the route may be divided into two main sections, the first between Akaba and Ma'an, the station on the Hejaz Railway, the second between the latter place and Jauf el-'Amr. In the first section camping-places are optional. A short first stage is often made at Abul-Heirah, not far from the well 'Ain Ma'in. A second stage may be made near the mouth of Wadi el-Mudheifein ; in 1905 Turkish troops (see below) appear to have halted at Quweirah, where there is now a military post. Musil camped with Arabs to W. of the road, about 5 miles N. of this place. In the third stage, the route crosses the escarpment of Jebel Shera, close beyond which is the well 'Ain Fuweilah, where the third night may be passed. Three cross-tracks leaving the Wadi 'Arabah in the direction of Ma'an probably intersect this part of the route. The most southerly, starting up the Wadi Dharbah, should come in not far from Quweirah. The two others ascend the Wadi Umweilah and the Wadi Gharandel respectively, the latter apparently passing through Delaghah and 'Ain el-Beidha. The second is reported fit for laden camels. In the first section of the route there are no serious natural obstacles, though the heat in the rock-bound valley of Yitm may be almost unbearable in the middle of the day. The ascent from the mouth of Wadi Yitm to the summit of Naqb Shatar is not difficult ; the way up the pass follows the windings of an old Roman road, which, if improved, would be possible for wheeled traffic ; in 1905, some 15,000 Turkish troops were taken this way from Ma'an to Akaba, a force presumably including artillery. Up to the foot of the pass the slopes are never very steep. On the far side of Shera, the ground falls gradually to Ma'an. Throughout the whole section, the surface is generally hard, and the going fairly good ; Musil covered the distance on horseback in about 23 hours. In the valley of Yitm, the track follows the line of the main Roman road from Akaba to the E. of the Dead Sea, few traces of which now remain. It would probably be easy to vary the route between Hemeimah and the Wadi Mureighah by keeping on in a N. direction along the Roman road as far as Ta'san (about 11 miles), where there is a well, or even to Sadaqah (17 miles), and crossing Jebel Shera from these points. Since the beginning of the war, the Otto man Government is said to have begun a survey for a line connecting Ma'an with Akaba; it is to leave the Hejaz Railway at Qal'at el- Mudawwarah, about 70 miles S. of Ma'an. The Arabs met with in the first section of the route are 'Amran (Tmran) and 'Alawin, sub-tribes of the Huweitat, whom both Doughty and Musil found friendly;WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 17-39) 43 and the Ma'zi (Ma'azah) and other sub-tribes of the 'Atiyah, who, according to Musil, are liable to raid the Hisma plain; the 'Atiyah and Huweitat are, however, in close alliance (see Vol. I, p. 60). As for the second section of the route, the country between Ma'an and Weisit is, in the main, a level plateau over which the going is very good indeed ; there are no physical difficulties, but hot winds [simums) are prevaleht during the summer months. At Weisit, the route joins the much frequented mercantile road from the Hauran to Jauf and Central Arabia, and follows the broad Wadi Sirhan, the bed of which is sandy in parts and gravelly in others. The track here winds considerably to avoid sand-hills, but it is otherwise comparatively easy. Supplies. Over the first section, food-supplies for the whole distance must be carried from Akaba, though Musil received some hospitality from Bedouins on both sides of Jebel Shera, especially from the 'Alawln on the slopes of Jebel Muweilah ; Doughty was also entertained by these 'Alawm, and noted their cultivation of barley on the Hisma plain. Water can be easily obtained in sufficient quantities for small parties ; the wells mentioned in the route are never at such distances from one another as to necessitate the carrying of more than one day's supply, and there are said to be cisterns for rain-water at Abul Heirah, Quweirah, and Harabat el-'Abid ; in the last place, the water is well protected, and Musil's map indicates permanent water. For large bodies of men, special arrangements for storing water would have to be made. For the Turkish expedition of 1905, 1,500 camels were provided by the Huweitat sheikhs, and water was stored in barrels at Quweirah and Abul-Heirah. Fodder and fuel are scarce over the first section, though, on the evidence of photographs, there should be coarse camel-grazing in many parts. On the E. side of the Jebel Shera escarpment, grass pasture is reported by Musil in the hollows, but the country immediately W. of Ma'an is desert. In the second section, water is only obtainable between Ma'an and Weisit, at Ba'ir, where it is excellent ; beyond Weisit, along the Wadi Sirhan, possibly as far as Adhara', wells are frequent, but the water is mostly brackish ; the last 20 miles to Jauf are waterless. Sparse fodder is present when approaching Ba'ir, it is entirely absent between Ba'ir and Weisit, but is plentiful in Wadi Sirhan. Fuel is fairly plentiful throughout. No general food-supplies are procurable after Ma'an until Jauf is reached, except such things as may possibly be obtained at temporary encampments of Bedouins in Wadi Sirhan.44 COMMUNICATIONS Route No. 19, from Akaba to Teima, follows Route No. 18 as far as Ma'an. After leaving the latter place it traverses a vast limestone plain, the going being very good to Hausa, where it crosses a prominent limestone mountain range. Then there is a hilly stage, and after that good going to Fajar, where the ground is much broken with sandstone outcrops ; thenceforward the going is again good. ® Supplies. For the section from Akaba to Ma'an, see above, p. 43 On the rest of the route water is scanty except at Ma'an and Teima • between Mughairah and Teima there is no water that can be depended upon. Fuel is scarce between Hausa and Teima, but else where abundant. There is sufficient grazing for a small caravan to Fajar ; after that fodder is very scarce till Teima is reached. General supplies are obtainable only at Ma'an and Teima. (ii) Routes to the Centre These all pass in the main through fairly well-watered steppe country which admits of detours from the direct line in all direc tions.

Supplies. Water is abundant at Kheibar and Beidha Nethil, and elsewhere is plentiful after rain ; at any season the supply would probably suffice for small caravans. Fuel and fodder are not scarce, except in the harrah. The most travelled tracks in this section, the routes of the Persian Pilgrimage between Ha'il and Medina and Mecca respectively, are the least known to us, simply because, as Shiah Pilgrim tracks, they are not favourable avenues for Christian travellers. That between Ha'il and Medina (Route No. 22, from Medina to Ha'il) was followed by Wallin in 1845 ; but, beyond recording that he traversed it in 85 hours' fast marching, he has left no account of his journey. Like all the routes to the Centre, it encounters its main physical difficulties in its earlier stages, when it crosses the high harrah country which lies east of Hejaz. It is subject to Harb raids. It was attempted unsuccessfully in autumn, 1904, by a Turkish force bound for Ha'il, which had to turn back after much suffering from lack of sufficient water in the wells and the opposition of the Harb. The only point near its line where a force could halt and recruit is the oasis of Kheibar, about 70 miles N. of Medina. The direct road from Mecca to Ha'il (Route No. 23) has been seen by no European south of Mustajiddah (near to which point Doughty wandered in 1877), with the exception of a small section in the southern part traversed by Burton on his route from Medina to Mecca ; and, as of Route No. 22, nothing more can be said of it in particular than appears in the description on p. 152 ff. It also is much raided by the Harb. -Doughty says of it (ii. 52) : ' From Hayil to Mecca are five hundred miles at least, over vast deserts, which they pass in fifteen long marches, not all years journeying by the same landmarks, but according to that which is reported of the waterings (which are wells of the Aarab), and of the peace or dangers of the wilderness before them. Ibn Rashid's Haj have been known to go near by Kheybar, but they commonly hold a course from Mustajidda or the great watering of Semira, to pass east of the Harrat el-Kesshub, and from thence in other two days descend to the underlying Mecca country by Wady Laymun.' This would mean a detour somewhat to the east of a straight line drawn between Mecca and Ha'il.46 COMMUNICATIONS The tracks to Qasim from Medina and Mecca are in only little better case. That from Medina to Rass (Route No. 24), though traversed by several Europeans during the Wahabite war of 1817-19, has not been described in detail by any one. It has been covered by considerable regular forces more than once—by the Egyptian army in 1817-19, and by four Turkish battalions under Sidki Pasha in late winter, 1905. The remnants of these last straggled back from Qasim a year later stripped of arms, accoutrements, and shoes. / | | The track from Mecca to Qasim (Aneizah, Boreidah), given as Route No. 25, is known from Doughty's and Huber's journeys only, on alternative lines for most of the distance, the main pilgrimage line remaining unseen. Since, however, it is a section of the great trans-Peninsular route, and the alternative lines are almost as much in use as the main pilgrim road, it merits more particular mention here. As followed in the reverse direction from Mecca, it is a single route as far as 'Asheirah, where the Darb es- Sultani, the pilgrim road to Boreidah, diverges to the left. Farther on, at Umm el-Masha'ib, the route forks once more, the two branches (the left Doughty's, the right Huber's) uniting again at Shabibiyah, near Aneizah. There are thus three alternatives for part of the way. They traverse for the most part lava fields and desert steppe sloping generally very slightly to the NE., at a mean altitude, till they reach Qasim, of about 4,000 ft. The Darb es-Sultani is said to be well provided with water. Elsewhere watering-places are fairly numerous, but water is usually scanty and poor. There is not much, apparently, to choose in the matter of length : each of the first two appears to be just under 480 miles, and the third less than 20 miles longer. It is difficult to compare these routes : two of them have been adequately described by Huber and Doughty respectively ; the Darb es-Sultani seems not to be known by any European. This latter would appear to be the easiest of the three, having most permanent water and reaching inhabited places in the direction of Qasim sooner than do the others ; on the other hand, both Doughty's and Huber's parties were caravans of traders, not explorers, and therefore must have followed the 'line of least resistance. Perhaps they avoided the pilgrim route because it traverses the country of the predatory Harb ; but in so doing, they got into the country of the hardly less formidable Ateibah. With this tribe, however, the Sherif's safe- conduct is of more avail. Supplies.

Fuel, however, of the scrub kind is fairly abundant. Water, as has been said, is usually sufficient and sweet. Of Route No. 26, from Mecca to Riyadh, which coincides with the above for 300 miles, and again coincides with Route No. 15 in the last stages, no more need be said except that it is the Wahabite pilgrimage road and that its intermediate stages have been travelled by no European. They seem, however, to present no difficulties, fairly large and well-supplied settlements occurring all along the line through Woshm. (iii) Linking Routes between Medina and Mecca These are pilgrimage roads ; they are four in number, and known as the Darb es-Sultani, the Darb esh-Sharqi, the Wadi el-Qura route, and the Tariq el-Ghabir. The two first are described in detail in the following chapter. The Wadi el-Qura track is a favourite with dromedary caravans ; on this road are two or three small settlements and regular wells, and there is free passage through the territory of the Beni 'Amr. The Tariq el-Ghabir, a mountain path, is avoided by the great caravans on account of its rugged passes ; water is plentiful along the whole line, but there is not a single village, and it is liable to raids by the Subh, a Bedouin sub-tribe of the Harb. It should be remembered that not infrequently all roads between Medina and Mecca are closed by the action of the Harb tribe. Route No. 27 is the only one of the above routes protected at all points by block-houses and supplied with road-side markets and coffee-shops. It traverses rugged hill-country from Bir 'Ali to Hamra and beyond, but for the rest, it lies in the main in thin sandy waste until Wadi Fatimah is reached. Supplies. Only on this, of the four routes specified, can food stuffs be obtained in any quantity and, even here, not in abundance, the suqs of Hamra, Safrah, Rabugh, and Khalis being very small and poorly supplied. Honey is a special commodity of Safrah, and bananas, from the plantations of Wadi Khuwar, at Khalis. Forage is fairly plentiful in spring throughout the route, and fuel can be gathered from the bush-vegetation which is abundant. Water presents no difficulties.48 COMMUNICATIONS As it is often advisable to avoid the range of this or that clan of the Harb, who hold the country along at least two-thirds of the preceding route, it follows that, between Medina and Rabugh, the same line is not always followed. There are several alternative tracks, of which the three most important are described schemati cally under Route No. 28 ; they all traverse more or less hilly country. A fourth, the Ghair Route, described in the Indian Government Road Book, is so obviously erroneous that it is not included here. Supplies. All the alternatives appear to be well supplied with water, and fairly so with fodder and fuel. As to foodstuffs available, there is little information ; but they are probably not obtainable in any quantities, except perhaps at such settlements as Khalis and Beder, which have small bazaars. On or near the line of the Darb esh-Sharqi or inland track (Route No. 29) runs the projected extension of the Hejaz- Railway, whose construction the Harb tribesmen, abetted by the Grand Sherif, successfully frustrated. The Darb esh-Sharqi is a dangerous as well as a difficult route and appears to be but seldom used now for fear of the restless Harb and Ateibah tribes. From Medina to Suweirqiyah the track follows the low beds of sandy wadis ; from that point to Dharibah it crosses a succession of basins or depressions (known as ghadlr, pi. ghudrdn), in which water stagnates, the basins being separated by ridges or flats of basalt and greenstone averaging from 100 to 200 ft. in height. Beyond Dharibah, the track enters a region of water-courses or fiumaras, generally deep and narrow in character, tending W. and SW. The region traversed is intermittently volcanic and excep tionally barren, but rich in primary formations such as basalt, hornblende, greenstone, diorite, and pink and grey granites. Burton says : ' The landward (eastern) faces of the hills are disposed at a sloping angle, contrasting strongly with the perpendicularity of their seaward slopes.' Supplies. Foodstuffs are not obtainable en route, except perhaps at the stages of Suweirqiyah and Sufeinah, which have small but fairly well-supplied bazaars, and in Wadi Leimun and the stage beyond ; at one or two other points also dates and grain are culti vated. Wells are few, and water (obtained mainly by digging) is good when rain is fresh in the wadis, saltish in the plains, and bitter in the nitrous basins and depressions. Forage and fuel are very abundant in some stages of this route (the former only in spring); in other stages they are entirely absent, as noted under the route.WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 17-39) (iv) Routes in North Hejaz These are cross-routes running from the ports of Yambo', Wejh, and Muweilah to points on the Hejaz Railway. The only authority for the route from Muweilah to Tebuk (Route No. 30) is Wallin, who traversed it from the coast in 1847. It is a camel-track, and cara vans usually take four days for the journey. In climbing the coastal range the ravines are steep and rugged, but the descent on the east of the watershed is gentle ; there are no recognized halting-places. Supplies. Water, fuel, and fodder are abundant at Muweilah, and are apparently obtainable along the route. Of the two alternative tracks from Wejh to El-'Ala, which are given in Route No. 31 from reports by officers of the Egyptian army, the southern and shorter route is mentioned by Doughty as the one used by the rice and date carrying caravans. It is a route for camel transport, and was followed by the Egyptian Hajj in 1909-10 on the down journey ; it goes through mountainous country, as it crosses the Hejaz coastal range. The northern and longer route, which is there given as the first alternative, passes over similar country : it was followed by the Egyptian Hajj in 1909-10 on the up journey. The route given as a second alternative is that followed by Euting, in 1884, in the reverse direction. In the Wadi el-Hamm, one day's march from El-'Ala, he was attacked by a party of Juheinah, but succeeded in reaching a camp of the Billi us under whose protection he was travelling. He waited with them W two days and then resumed his journey, joining another caravan eifff at the point he had left the route. Euting did the journey from tall El-'Ala to Wejh in just under five days' actual marching, but he Me gives no detailed times and few indications of direction. Supplies. Springs yielding a tepid and brackish water are reported antjd to occur along the whole of this coast at a slight depth below the surface of the ground, but the presence of water along the actual Kflf route is uncertain ; along the first alternative track there are ulk wells at Kazaz and Beidha, and along the second alternative track Euting reports water at Dhureib, Meleihah, and in the reti Wadi esh-Shillul. Fuel and fodder are scarce and other supplies ^iii non-existent, ilte k ® The route from Wejh to Medina (Route No. 32) has not been rt): travelled by any European, and in the following chapter it is only jfillf possible to describe it schematically ; no details are available as to supplies along the route.it 50 COMMUNICATIONS The southernmost of this group of routes is the best known that from Yambo' to Medina (Route No. 33). It is much travelled, since owing to their insecurity, the direct tracks between Mecca and Medina are more shunned than used, and pilgrims arriving by the Hejaz Railway often prefer, and sometimes are obliged, to go down to Yambo' and continue their journey by sea to Jiddah. Similarly, after the Mecca visit, many who wish to see Medina also, reverse this process rather than risk a caravan journey between the towns. But even the Yambo'-Medina road is very far from safe, as well as ill-watered and arduous, owing to the broken, mountainous character of the country in the last half of it. For these reasons also there are many local variations in the line followed. The track most frequently used seems to be that by way of Safrah and Hamra. Supplies. In the first part of the journey water is abundant only after the spring rains ; there are good springs and streams through out the mountainous section. Some fuel and fodder are obtainable along the route, but other supplies, in any quantity, only at Yambo' and Medina. (v) Coast Routes in Hejaz The Egyptian Hajj route, from Akaba to Mecca, is described as Koute No. 84. It is a well-defined track along the coastal plain and keeps generally near the sea. Along the whole of its course it presents no difficulties for laden camels. Between Hanak and Hura t caravan has on several occasions been attacked by the J uheinah, while in the neighbourhood of Rabugh the Harb tribesmen render it far from secure. Supplies. Water is obtainable at most stages, but there is none between Wejh and Hura. Fuel and fodder apparently suffice in mos p aces for the Hajj caravans. Vegetables, dates, and sometimes o tier iruits are obtainable at certain points, but general supplies only at Yambo' and Mecca. 5 11 The coastal route from Jiddah to Yambo', which, with an alterna- tive track between Jiddah and Rabugh, is given schematically in the o ownig c apter as Route No. 35, crosses the sandy Tihamah, and „ there 1 t ^ e g oin g is very bad even for camels.

Yemen (from Jiddah to Hodeidah) is very ill-known, and has been traversed by no European ; a con siderable portion of the first part of it, as far as Qunfudah, was traversed by the Sherif s forces in 1911. It is not much in use, owing to the heat and barrenness of the tracts through which it passes and the predatory uncontrolled character of the North Asir tribes._ At present it is cut by Idrisi, who controls it in the Abu Arish district. It lies wholly in the coastal plain known as the Tihamah and runs mostly along the shore, following the tele graph line as far as Loheia. (From that point the telegraph con tinues to keep near the coast, while the route turns inland.) The track lies over sand, and is suitable for camels only; the going is very heavy in places, but there are no other physical difficulties. The section from Loheia to Hodeidah is constantly used by Turkish troops and convoys ; it is an easy route, across open desert country for most of the way. Supplies. Water is apparently limited over a great part of the route ; except for the meagre details given for a few of the stages, no information is available ; between Loheia and Hodeidah the supply is reported to be sufficient and good. Fodder and other supplies would be very limited, even for a small caravan. Meat can be obtained at Jiddah, and, by waiting a few days, at Qunfudah. Route No. 37, on the other hand, which runs from Jiddah to Mecca, is the most travelled track in Arabia, protected by block houses at intervals, and well supplied with halt-stations. The first few miles are over sandy plain, after which the track passes through a range of low hills to the plain of Bahrah. Thence it leads over dusty undulating country to the main range of West Arabia, in a foothill valley of which, running NE. into the range, lies the Holy City at a mean altitude of not more than 700 ft, A carriage could pass with difficulty over this track, and continue by the more northerly (Seil) route to Ta'if (64 miles as the crow flies, but well over 100 by this route ; see Route No, 38, alternative) ; but it is not the practice to use carriages on the Jiddah road, although guns have often been wheeled over it. Mecca donkeys are the best riding animals for this road (see above, p. 16). The road is un- metalled and not embanked, but it has been worn to a very fair surface, and is not interrupted by any natural obstacles. d 2 r52 COMMUNICATIONS The direct road from Mecca to Ta'if is described as Route No. 38. The first part of it conducts the annual pilgrimage to 'Arafat, and forms a well-beaten track, paved for a short distance in the neigh bourhood of Mina (Muna). At about mid-way, the route meets the great natural barrier of Jebel Qora, the ascent of which cannot be made by camels, loads being transported to the summit by mules and asses. Beyond, it offers no physical difficulties and is a descending track most of the way. The Seil route to Ta'if, referred to above and given briefly in the following chapter as an alternative, is much longer, but practicable for camels throughout. Supplies. Water is abundant throughout the direct road and exceptionally good along some of the stages ; fodder and fuel may be obtained ; other supplies (with the exception of fruits and such small commodities as may be found at coffee-shops) are only to be had at Mecca and Ta'if. As to supplies along the alternative, little information is available, though water and fodder appear to be plentiful along the first half of the route at least ; but of general supplies there are none. Of tracks connecting Hejaz with Yemen, that along the coast has been dealt with already (see Route No. 36). Two others, inland, are more travelled when the Ottoman Power is sufficiently strong to_ secure passage through Asir. Of these, one route, starting from Ta'if, follows the Hajj caravan road from Mecca to San'a; the section between Ta'if and Ibha is described under Route No. 44, while that between Ibha and San'a, via Ibal, is described under Route No. 59. It has not yet been traversed by any European except from Khamir to San'a, and appears to lie largely through mountainous country in the southern section, and through hilly desert country farther north, but it is practicable all the way for camels and donkeys. The other, and more northerly inland route, also starting from Ta'if, runs to Bishah, from which point it follows the track of Route No. 59 to San'a. Its first section, from Ta'if to Bishah, is here described under alternative forms as Route No. 39 the first alternative is apparently an easy caravan route, since it was traversed by the Sherif's force in 1911, and the second alternative by a force of 12,000 men in 1834. Supplies. }\ ater is fairly plentiful throughout, except in the section between Liyah and Bisal, which, according to Tamisier, is waterless ; forage appears to be ample around many of the halting- places, and there is much fuel throughout ; grazing is good, as there is a large pastoral population ; supplies of cereals and dates are obtainable at Turabah 'Aqiq, and Thaniyah in particular, besides at Ta'if and Bishah2^ SOUTH-WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 40-66) 53 E. SOUTH-WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 40-66) (i) Routes in Asir imiil; . These routes (Nos. 40—54) have been compiled entirely from native Sati! information, and therefore can only be expected to locate approxi- t«Ti| matel y the places referred to. Travelling in Asir is apt to be a dan- ttiss gerous matter, not through any natural causes, but on account of the % uncontrolled and predatory character of the tribes. Natives, there- oaJsv fore, generally attach themselves to some armed caravan before Nl y cnturin g 9 llt side their own boundaries. The Turks in Asir have, ittW t or some time P ast ' been restricted to the use of the road down iljtol Wadi Tayyah from Ibha (Ebha) to Muha'il (Route No. 45), and to the Sikkat el-Barak, or Tariq es-Sultani, from Muha'il on to t Qunfudah (Route No. 49). 'Mi tw0 exce P tions the routes here given start from Ibha or Muha'il. Nos. 40-47 radiate from Ibha, beginning with the track leading SSW. to Darb on the main Tihamah road ; the remaining se . v e n routes are arranged in order round the circle, concluding filial with that to Wahlah, which also lies on the Tihamah road to the ysto; ^ • R ai ^'. ; Route No. 40, from Ibha to Darb, known as the i™(w l)arb Beni Shi bah, is not much used, being rough and precipitous in parts and infested by hostile Arabs. It has, however, a certain strategical importance, as part of an alternative route between Sabia (Sabiyah) and Ibha. The direct track from Ibha to Sabia is given as Route No. 41. The main inland road from the Yemen to the Hejaz is described in Routes No. 42 (Ibha to Dahran) and No. 44 (Ibha to Ta'if). It lies for the most part through elevated hilly country, and is practicable both for donkeys and camels. The Ibha to Bishah road (Route No. 43) sees considerable traffic during the date season. It is only traversed by large and well-armed caravans on account of the robber bands of nomads en route. The caravans, as a rule, are formed at Khamis Musheit, and travel under the escort of the Shahran tribe. The road is fairly level, and passes over a sterile and undulating country intersected by several fertile valleys. The variant of the route represents the line taken by the Sherif's forces in 1911. Route No. 45, from Ibha to Muha'il via Wadi Tayyah, though used by the Turks, is avoided by travellers and merchants, because neither water nor supplies can be procured for more than half the distance, and because the Wadi Tayyah is infested with robbers. The route coincides with the main pilgrim route to Mecca as far as Jebel Sha'r, and then plunges abruptly down the pass of 'Aqabah54 COMMUNICATIONS Sha'r till the Wadi Tayyah is reached. The Turks have improved the old road down the pass, and rendered it practicable for heavy loads. Ordinary travellers prefer the route from Muha'il via Sheibein, which is given as Route No. 46 ; though closed to the Turks for several years, this route is much used by caravans. Route No. 47, fromlbha to Wahlah, is the merchant or ordinary route from Ibha to the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, although much longer than the Darb Beni Shi'bah (Route No. 40). It is the most important trade route from southern inland Asir to the coast and runs down the Wadi Rim, which lies about half way between Wasm and Shuqaiq (see Route No. 53). It taps the fertile Rijal el-M'a country, and links up with all the main roads of the interior ; supplies and water are plentiful. The routes radiating from Muha'il (Nos. 48-52), with the exception of that to Tanumah (Route No. 48), lead to points on the coast, here taken in order from N. to S. Routes Nos. 49 and 50 are alternative tracks from Muha'il to Qunfudah, the one known as the Tariq es- Sultani or the Sikkat el-Barak, the other as the Sikkat el-Helawiyah. Route No. 51, from Muha'il to Hali Point, which is known as the Sikkat esh-Sheraf, has not been used for years by the Turks; mer chants and travellers pass along it, but it is infested by robber bands in Wadi Dofa'. R,oute No. 52 runs from Muha'il to Birk, a fair-sized village on the Tihamah-road between Hali Point and Wasm. Of the two remaining tracks described in this section Route No. 53, the coast-road of Asir, is the main maritime route from Lith to Wadi 'Ain and Loheia. In its first stages it passes through the dangerous zone of the Dhawi Hasan and Dhawi Barakat clans, and although both water and supplies are to be found in their villages, caravans have perforce to be self-sufficing. Further on the inhabitants are more hospitable, and the country is richer, and when the district of Mikhlaf el-Yemen, which is directly adminis tered by the Idrlsi, is entered, travelling becomes an easy matter. Lhe road keeps close to the coast from Lith to Umm el-Khishib (or Khashab) and then turns inland. It lies over sand, and is suitable for camels only ; the going is very heavy in places, but there are no other physical difficulties. The heat, however, is intense. Alternative routes are given, from Lith to Loheia, and from Umm el-Khishib to Loheia. The last of the Asir roads, Route No. 54, connects Tanumah and Barak ; it descends the long steep pass of Aqabah Sajein, and terminates in the district of Barak at Suq el-A'jamah, a local trading centre of some importance. Supplies. On all this group of tracks. Routes Nos. 40-54, villages are encountered at frequent intervals, and, except on Route No. 45,tee A track from Hodeidah to Mocha (Route No. 57) joins up the starting-points of the two routes just described. It is, however, little SOUTH-WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 40-66) there is no difficulty about supplies of water at any point in Asir. The villagers are, for the most part, friendly to strangers passing through on pilgrimage. The only other road from the coast sufficiently in use to be worth description is that from Mocha to Ta'izz (Route No. 56). At Ta'izz it joins the longitudinal road along the axis of the Highlands which is described under Route No. 62. Two-thirds of it he across the flat and sterile Tihamah plain ; the remainder is a difficult ascent to Ta'izz, but practicable for transport animals. The road crosses and recrosses the Mocha-Ta'izz telegraph line all the way. Supplies. Water is sufficient at all seasons. After rain it is abundant beyond the first stage, but even then the mountain torrents become lost in the Tihamah, and but little water reaches the coast. Fodder is very limited in the first stage, but plentiful thereafter. Small quantities of foodstuffs (cereals and vegetables, cattle, sheep and goats, milk and eggs, and some poultry) are obtainable when the mountains are reached. (ii) Routes in Yemen Of those from the coast to the Central Highlands, the road from Hodeidah to San'a (Route No. 55) is by far the most important, in the present political state of Yemen. It is the only made road of any considerable length in Arabia. It divides itself roughly into a desert and a mountainous section ; in the former, across the Tihamah, there is often very heavy going, and the latter involves difficult and trying ascents and descents. In 1913 the state of the road was reported to be ' bad on the mountain ' stages and ' indiffer ent everywhere but the revetments and culverts were generally in good order. The Turks have often marched large forces and transported guns (including heavy howitzers) over this road, e.g. in 1911. It can only be used for ordinary wheeled traffic on the last stage between Bo'an and San'a, where even motors could pass. The mails are usually carried by mules. There is a telegraph, with offices at most of the principal stages. Supplies. Water is plentiful and good throughout, but in the desert stages some of the wells are brackish. Other supplies, such as fodder and grain, are plentiful and readily procurable.56 COMMUNICATIONS travelled nowadays owing to the insecurity produced on its northern stages by the recalcitrant Zaranik (Dharaniq) tribesmen. Com paratively few details are available about it. It traverses or skirts the Tihamah plain throughout, and lies across barren desert nearly 'all the way. The actual track is not infrequently lost to view on account of shifting sand-drifts, and wide detours have sometimes to be made in consequence. Some parts are exceedingly heavy going. Supplies. There is, in general, a sufficient supply of water from wells, but it is neither plentiful nor very good. Fodder is scarce, and other supplies, except at Beit el-Faqih and Zebid, are prac tically unobtainable. The track from San'a to Riyadh in South Nejd, which is given as Route No. 58, depends in great measure on native report, and distances and details in connexion with it must be accepted with all reserve. It is said to be a regular caravan track. The Yemen section of the route is mountainous, and, after leaving the plateau about Makhlaf (or Mikhlaf) el-Nejran, it is a purely desert route through some of the least known parts of Arabia. The journey would be a severe one in both the mountainous and the desert sections, and suitable for the most part for dhelul (female camel) riders only. Supplies. From San'a to Makhlaf, water and fodder are plentiful, or easily obtainable from the districts in the neighbourhood; but, beyond, they would probably be scarce (even very scarce in parts) as far as Badi'. An alternative track from San'a to Tamrah, by way of Sa'dah and Ibal, is given as Route No. 59. It is a portion of the Hajj caravan road from Yemen, and has not been traversed, beyond Khamir (52 miles), by any European. To Bishah, the route lies mostly in the mountainous districts of Yemen and Asir, but is said to be practicable for camels and donkeys ; beyond Bishah, the country becomes undulating and easier, though more sandy, and the track leads down broad wadis to Tamrah. Supplies. ater is certainly plentiful to Khamir, and is pre sumably sufficient for the Hajj caravans to Ibal, and probably also as far as Bishah. As to fodder and general supplies in this section, both are ample as long as the track continues in Yemen country ; beyond^ no definite information is available. In the ertile oases of Bishah itself, supplies of all kinds are plentiful; but after that point, except at Dam (170 miles from Bishah) and»acceptfJri; ck. liefdj •elv tert® a.

Brackish water is reported at one or two places along these stages. (a) Of roads described in the following chapter three lead far into Yemen. Route No. 60 (from Aden to Mocha via Sheikh Sa'id) is suited only to mounted parties, preferably camel sowars, or to convoys, on account of the distances between some of the wells. It is mostly heavy going over sandy desert, but offers no special difficulties to laden camels. Supplies. Water is plentiful, but mostly brackish and suitable only for animals. There is good water from springs at one or two places. Forage is scanty along the actual route, but foodstuffs can be obtained, at some points, from the fertile districts inland, except along the Sheikh Sa'id-Mocha section. There is sufficient grazing for camels, as a rule. Route No. 61 is the trunk road from Aden up to the Yemen Highlands and along their axis to San'a. From Aden to Musemir (Mus'aimir) it runs through open and fairly level country, with heavy sand in parts, till the mountains are entered ; wheeled artillery and camel-carts can be taken as far as Nubat Dakim. From Musemir to Qa'tabah it ascends through hilly country, and is difficult and liable to interruption by floods in Wadi Tiban. From Qa'tabah to Yerlm it lies through wild broken country, with sudden steep ascents and descents, and generally is bad going; it is suitable in the greater part for mules only. Harris describes this section of the route as ' of the greatest difficulty ' ; he adds that through ' wild broken country, road grows rougher as it proceeds '. From Yerim to San'a there is a succession of high plains divided by rough but not very elevated ridges. The going in this stage is good on the whole, but with some difficult ascents and descents. The last stage, after Wa'lan, is quite easy. (iii) Routes in the Aden Protectorate A selection only of Aden routes is described in this handbook. It is sufficient to indicate the way to the more important social centres; but in so well populated and settled a district as South- Western Arabia many more cross-routes are in continual use. For fuller information the Military Report of the Aden Govern ment, or the Indian Government's Road Book of Arabia, should be consulted.58 COMMUNICATIONS Supplies. Water is plentiful throughout, except perhaps in some parts between Qa'tabah and Yerim ; fodder and foodstuffs are easily obtainable, except in some stages of the same section. Route No. 62, from Aden to Yerim, is suitable as far as Ta'izz for all arms except wheeled artillery. It is a fairly easy and safe road, with no serious obstacles to transport except in time of flood. From Ta'izz to Yerim it is more difficult than in the preceding section, owing to the steep and tortuous ascents and descents encountered in places, but it offers no very great obstacles to transport animals. Supplies. Water is good throughout, and there is a sufficiency in all seasons. Fodder is plentiful, or easily obtainable, at most stages ; there is good grazing for camels all along the route; and foodstuffs (grain, cattle, chickens, eggs, &amp;c.) are plentiful if notice is given beforehand. (6) Of roads lying virtually altogether in the Protectorate, Route No. 63, which runs from Aden to Qa'tabah via Nubat Dakim and Khoreibah, is the road that was regularly used by troops and convoys marching from Aden to the Dhala plateau in 1903. Wheeled artillery and camel-carts were taken as far as Nubat Dakim, but not without difficulty, owing to heavy sand in parts. It is suitable throughout for camels and mules, and hes at first through generally open level country; then mountains are entered and there is a long ascent, very difficult in parts, to the summit of the Khoreibah pass, with a fairly easy undulating descent onwards to Qa'tabah. Supplies. Water is sufficient in all stages, but must be filtered at certain places ; and, if troops are marching in considerable numbers, buckets, ropes, and tanks should be carried for drawing and storing. Forage is plentiful in the lowland stages, but must be arranged for beforehand ; it is also obtainable in fair quantities at certain places in the mountain section. Route No. 64 is a variant of the above, running from Aden to Qa'tabah by way of Dhala, It is suitable for small mounted parties only, on account of the severe waterless march across the desert in the earlier stages, where only camel transport could pass ; beyond that point mules may also be used. Supplies. Water is plentiful, except in the second stage, where it must be carried. Fodder is plentiful or easily obtainable in the first stage, non-existent in the second, but after that point procur able in moderate quantities.Winsome afeifj nf tion, 11 w la 1 ® s y and 8al e 1116 of ■e prectdiiij ^ desceiiti obstacles t« efficiency ii most stages; nd/wfenifl tice is giTa Protectatt, liibat Dala *1 by tajs eai in 1, ir as ikt I in parts, It first tbiigl dandtteE lieKliorahl ) Qa'taU, be filtered at iblemte, ;andstorii|, i arranged for certain pte join Mffl to aal morf ■ch across tk ^ could pass; stage, At iinablein^ point priK®' ■ SOUTH-WESTERN ROUTES (Nos. 40-66) The other two routes described afford access to the easterly parts of the Protectorate. Route No. 65, from Aden to Shughrah (Shuqrah), is part of the featureless coast route from Aden to Makalla, and is very hot and unhealthy in the hot season. Supplies. Water is scanty, the wells being of very limited capacity and few and far between, and is mostly brackish. Fodder is plentiful in the cultivated tracts round Wadi Bana, and in places along the track there is a little grazing for camels. Route No. 66, runs from Shughrah to Makalla by way of Nisab and Balhaf. The first section as far as Nisab, leading inland, is an exceedingly strenuous track, and may be divided broadly into three sections : [a) a winding ascent through rough country from the coast to the coastal upland of Jahein ; [h) a track over very broken and mountainous country, difficult of access, across the Kaur Range and the rugged Dahr plateau ; and (c) an awkward approach along confined stony wadis to Nisab. From Nisab the track turns again towards the coast, which is reached at Balhaf, after passing through zones of similar country in the reverse order. From Balhaf there is a cart road to Makalla. Supplies. Water must be carried for the first three stages and for the sixth stage, and the supply is very limited beyond Balhaf ; elsewhere it is abundant. Fodder is plentiful throughout, the camel grazing being especially excellent between Yeshbum and Balhaf. Fuel is also abundant, the route traversing many well-wooded wadis. Foodstuffs, such as grain, dates, sheep, poultry and goats, can be secured in plenty at Nisab and Yeshbum and at some of the intervening settlements ; but at Balhaf and along the coast there are practically no supplies. Honey, in considerable quantities, and locally grown tobacco are procurable at Yeshbum. F. SOUTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 67-69) It is not known what routes lead from the coast across the Great South Desert—nor even whether any such routes exist. If they do, they can be feasible only for very small, very well mounted, and very light parties at a season of the year when camels are in full milk . It is known, however, that caravans go up to southern Nejd from the south-east and south-west by rounding one flank or the other of the Desert. It is, however, easy to penetrate from the coast as far as the fertile district of Wadi Hadhramaut; and two of the main tracks leading60 COMMUNICATIONS thither are detailed in the following chapter. Route No. 67, which starts from Makalla, or alternatively from Shiheir, leads to Terim and Qabr Hud by way of Shibam and Seyyun. The road first traverses the narrow coastal plain and, after ascending the plateau by stages, reaches the heads of the group of tributary wadis, all of which lead, after abrupt difficult descents, northward into the main Hadhramaut Wadi. The route detailed here takes the course of the Wadi el-'Aisar and the Wadi Do'an (or Wadi Kesr). It is possible for camel transport, but is difficult in places owing to the nature of the abrupt ascents and descents encountered, which make riding impossible. Supplies. Water is brackish in the first stage, but elsewhere generally good and plentiful, with the possible exception of some parts of the third and fourth stages. Fodder is generally sufficient, but the supply at the third and fourth stages cannot be depended upon. General supplies are non-existent and, although livestock is often plentiful in the interior regions through which the route passes, the people are fanatical and refuse to sell to non-Moslems. Route No. 68 is an alternative track from Shiheir to Shibam. It is suited mainly for camel transport, but is difficult in places owing to the hills ; horses can, however, be taken all along it. Supplies. Water is obtainable at each stage, but the quantity available at the second and fourth stages is doubtful. Fodder for camels may be procured, except along the second and third stages General supplies are practically non-existent. Livestock is to be obtained except at the second and third stages, where it is only to be had if the Bedouin flocks happen to have found grazing. Route No. 69, from Makalla to Lashkharah, which is the last described m this section, is a connecting-route between Hadhra maut and Oman, passing through Dhofar and along the south-east coast of the Oman Sultanate. Its length is nearly a thousand miles, it follows the coast-line, and passes through some extremely barren and desolate country, especially in its closing stages after 14.? r I n ain ' It P resents no physical obstacles and is not chfficult for camel transport, while the first half from MakaUa to Murbat would be possible also for horses. The track runs on the op of the cliffs or along the beach, sometimes making a detour w fK 1° a ?• patch of rough basalt or a Wretch of soft sand. With the exception of the fertile plain of Dhofar the country 18 l f rren 5 towards its close the track winds a nong low sand-hills. It rarely leaves the coast except where itSOUTHERN ROUTES (Nos. 67-69) 61 is possible to make a short cut by avoiding a promontory or head land, such as the Barr el-Hikman after passing Mahot. Supplies. Between Makalla and Murbat the supply of water would suffice for small caravans ; at Raidah and Hami hot springs only are available, but water is good and abundant in the Dhofar plain and at Ghaidhah (1) and (2). Between Murbat and Lashkha- rah it is scarce and brackish. Fuel and camel grazing are both fairly plentiful between Makalla and Murbat, the latter being especially good and abundant in the Dhofar plain ; after leaving Murbat they would probably be found in sufficient quantities for small caravans. General supplies, with the exception of fish, are very limited through out. Between Makalla and Seihut small quantities of vegetables and some cereals are obtainable, but from Seihut onwards prac tically no supplies of grain can be relied on. As far as Murbat a few cattle and sheep are to be found in the hamlets at certain points, but owners have been known to refuse to sell to non-Moslems. Between Murbat and Lashkharah the Bedouin and semi-nomadic tribes, who frequent stretches of the coast, are extremely poor, and no supplies can be relied on. G. SOUTH-EASTERN ROUTES (Nos. 70-75) In the well-populated and, in the main, settled district of Oman, as in the Aden Protectorate, far more tracks are in constant use than are described in this handbook. For others, the Indian Govern ment's Road Book of Arabia, or the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf should be consulted. The selection here given is intended to link up the principal centres. Route No. 70, from Sur to Nizwa (and Adam) via Ibra and Manah, forms the principal line of communication from the coast of Eastern Hajar to Sharqiyah and Ja'lan. It crosses Eastern Hajar by the Wadi Fuleij (or Faleij), and traverses Sharqiyah westwards by the Wadi el-Ha'imah. The route is passable for pack transport except in the Wadi Fuleij after heavy rain, which is said to fall once in three years ; the swollen and rapid streams then render the valley im passable for caravans. The branch route,, from Kamil to Lash kharah, traverses Ja'lan to the SE. coast. Supplies. Water, fuel, fodder, and livestock are obtainable through out, but are scanty at Ruksat; there are bazaars at Kamil, Badiyah, Ibra, Manah, Nizwa, and Adam ; many of the villages possess camels, donkeys, cattle, and sheep.62 COMMUNICATIONS Route No. 71, from Muscat to Bireimi by way of Nizwa, 'Ibri, and Dhank, at first traverses Wadi Sema'il, the principal line of com munication from the coast to the interior of Oman. After crossing the watershed it descends by Wadi Halfein to Izki, and passes below the base of Jebel Akhdhar to Nizwa. It crosses Jebel el-Kor between Oman Proper and Dhahirah, by the principal pass 'Aqabat el- Barak ; and between Ibri and Dhank it traverses the pass of Jebel el-Fuleij (or Faleij), reaching Bireimi across the plain of NE. Dha hirah. The route is possible for pack transport. The Wadi Sema'il usually contains a shallow stream flowing along a sandy bed, but it is liable to come down in flood after rain, rendering this section difficult; the valley is narrow, and is commanded in many places from the surrounding hills. The ascent of the pass 'Aqabat el-Barak, between Nizwa and Tbri, is possible for loaded camels, though fatiguing from the rugged character of the ground ; the pass of Jebel el-Fuleij is also difficult by reason of its steep gradient and boulder-strewn track. Supplies. Water from streams and conduits is abundant along the first part of the route ; though not so plentiful between Nizwa and Bireimi, it is obtainable at all stages. Fud, fodder, and food- s tuff s are also plentiful along the greater part of the route • but they are not always obtainable from Tanuf to the further side of the pass 'Aqabat el-Barak. Route No. 72, from Muscat to Dhank by way of Rostaq and Miskin, toilows the coast-road to Masna'ah, and ascends thence by the Wadi iara' to Rostaq ; it traverses the foothills of the Western Hajar y Vv adi Sahtan and W adi Beni Ghafir, and, after passing the watershed, crosses NE. Dhahirah into the W T adi Dhank. There is a good camel-track along the coast from Matrah to Masna'ah, which is also traversed at the beginning of Route No. 73 ; from Masna'ah the route is also passable for pack transport, but between Rostaq and Dhank it is difficult in places owing to its hilly nature. An alternative and longer approach to Rostaq leaves the coast-road at buwdq to the W. of Masna'ah, and joins the route at Hazam. aupplies. Water, fuel, and fodder are obtainable aU along the Dhank 1 f 00 ^ stu ff s at Sib, Barkah, Masna'ah, Suweiq, Rostaq, and Route No. 73, from Muscat to Abu Dhabi via Bireimi, foUows the coas o Sohar ; thence it turns westward and crosses the Oman Promontory to the Persian Gulf. From Muscat to Matrah is bad going and the journey is generally done by boat.

From Sohar to Bireimi the track follows the Wadi el-Jizi, a shallow water-course between bare and sterile hills, and after passing the watershed it crosses a fairly level plain ; it offers no difficulties to transport animals. From Bireimi to Abu Dhabi the track lies across stretches of sandy desert, mostly dunes and undulating downs ; the only physical obstacle encountered is the tidal salt-water creek that must be crossed ten miles from Abu Dhabi. Supplies. Along the coast, water is obtainable at all stages from wells at 15—20 ft. ; fuel, fodder, and livestock are available all along this section ; and supplies can be obtained from the bazaars at Sib, Barkah, Masna'ah and Sohar. Water, fuel, and grazing are abundant from Sohar to Bireimi. From Bireimi onward there are no villages nor settled inhabitants ; water of poor quality and in limited quantities is obtained from wells and water-holes, whioh are soon exhausted and take time to replenish ; grazing is very scarce during the summer months. The other routes He outside Oman proper but connect it with Hasa. Route No. 74, from Hofuf to Ras el-Kheimah, passes across the southern border of El-Qatar ; it traverses Trucial Oman to Bireimi by the route nearest the coast, which is that usually followed by caravans in summer, the line of the route more inland being given as an alternative ; from Bireimi it follows the main line of traffic northwards through the Oman Promontory to Ras el-Kheimah on the NW. coast. The route is practicable only for camel transport. It lies over fairly level desert, winding incessantly among sand- dunes and zig-zagging from well to well. There is no recognizable nor well-worn track, and no two caravans follow exactly the same course. When the track crosses sand-dunes it is obliterated as soon as made, and it is advisable for caravans to keep in close order. Supplies. Over nearly four-fifths of the route, as far as Bireimi, water is neither good nor abundant. There are some long stages without water, including three double-stages ; but it does not seem to be necessary on any portion of the route to carry more than three days supply. From Bireimi northwards water is plentiful during the winter months, except at Ras el-Kheimah, where it is always scarce and indifferent. During the summer months there is a general scarcity of water. For the first 125 miles grazing is abundant after rain, but not plentiful from that point to Bireimi ; from Bireimi northwards it is plentiful during the winter months. Fuel from64 COMMUNICATIONS stunted brushwood is obtainable at most stages along the route, and is plentiful after Bireimi. Foodstuffs are only obtainable at Hofuf and Bireimi; at Ras el-Kheimah dates, fish, and livestock are the only available supplies. Route No. 75, from Dohah to Hofuf, is a caravan track almost entirely over uninhabited desert country, which, in the Qatar peninsula, frequently has a hard firm surface. The Jafurah desert, entered after Ba'aij, is a desolate tract of red sand. Alternative tracks are given for the section of the route from Ba'aij to Jishshah. Supplies. Water and fodder are scanty except during the last stage. No foodstuffs are obtainable before Hofuf.CHAPTER III ROUTES ARABIA 11 EN.B.

Dir. then bears SSE. 30 30 (usual time, according to Wallin, from 12 to 14 hrs.; Huber and Euting passed the well of Hazeima just over 12 hours from Jauf, and Kheneifez, another of the group, just over 13| hours from Jauf), a depression of hard and saline soil, the western end of which the route crosses ; here are six or more well-built wells (Huber reports and names ten in the district), within range of 4 or 5 miles, 120-150 ft. in depth, forming large basins below, and having mouths a yard or more in diameter ; water sweet and excellent, and never failing totally throughout the year ; these are the only wells between Jauf and Jubbah, from 4 to 6 days' travel. Dir. continues SSE., track keeping E. of Jebel Raf, (passed after 2| hrs.) with Jebel Tawil beyond it, then crossing the great sand-dunes of Faluh,08 NORTHERN ROUTES miles. covered with vegetation, and following track known as El-KhaU, which can be pretty distinctly traced to Jubbah, but is in places swept away by moving sand ; going is very difficult owing to nature of ground, which undulates in continual scarped hills and hollows [fuluq or qu'ur), and is heavy on account of deep and loose sand. 50 m. 'Aleim en-Nefud, two pyramidal rocks, about 270 yds. apart, jutting out of sand, the higher (on 1.) some 300 ft. high ; conspicuous land mark ; alt. 3,220 ft. above sea-level. Dir. S. by E., continuing to wind among Juluq, but here, according to Huber, somewhat easier to traverse ; a high sand-mound, Semeihah, is passed and afterwards a deep depression with white lime stone floor known as El-Beidha ; in the latter well-borings but no water ; general level of the Nefiid gradually rises to its highest elevation of 3,300 ft. Approaching Jubbah harder ground appears, and the Nefud is temporarily left. 190 160 Jubbah, village now deserted (see I, p. 390), situated in extensive open plain or pan of elliptical form (10 m. by 12 m.), of hard stony soil, and backed by low hills, Urnrn es-Selmdn, about 500 ft. above plain, and Jebel 'Autah. [Wallin apparently did the joiirney from Jauf to Jubbah in 86| hrs. actual marching (18f hrs. to Shaqiq, 23| hrs. to 'Aleim, and 44^ hrs. to Jubbah), but his rate was slow as his ' animals were very weak and meagre'; he gives 4J days as the time usually taken for the route. Palgrave took at least 85 hrs., and Huber on his first journey (travelling about 2|- miles an hour) 76 hrs. Huber and Euting, who travelled more quickly, took 4 days and 1 hr. for the route, their actual marching (according to Huber's figures) working out at 59J hrs. Euting's com putation of 54 hrs. actual marching, like Guar- mani's 49| hrs. and Wetzstein's 52 hrs. (on native information), appear to underestimate the times required. The Blunts (on horses) took six days for the journey.]ROUTE 1: JAUF—HA'IL 69 miles, total, stages. Dir. E. by S., keeping north of the Selman (Sinman) and Ghutah hills. Ghutah Hill passed in about three hours, when the Nefud is re-entered. 242 52 Qena {Qna), small village (see I, p. 390), in plain of very white chalky ground ; six deep wells of sweet and abundant water, separated by short distances, with hamlet around each ; a few date-plantations and fruit gardens ; some cereals cultivated, especially barley.

Huber on his first journey passed through Laqitah but does not mention Waqid. Huber and Euting, and more re cently Miss Bell, after rounding Jebel Aja, took a more direct route to Ha'il, keeping closer to Jebel Aja. Miss Bell's route from Qena to Ha'il works out at 28 miles ; at 17^ miles from Qena (10| miles from Ha'il) she notes Qasr Laqitah 1 mile to E., and, 2| miles on, Laqitah village 3 miles to E.] 11m.

About 13 m. on, and closer to the route, lie the two deep wells of Howah (Hoa), with warm discoloured water of poor quality, near which, according to Nolde, is a ' small lake' with good rain-water. Neither of these places was visited by Shakespear, who took a more direct track, also passing at some distance from the saline depression of Shaqlq, which lies some miles to S., about 30 m. from Jauf, with 6 or more well- built wells, and abundant water at 120-150 ft.

According to Nolde, an isolated tower, connected with the fort by an underground passage, exposes to cross-fire the wells which lie between. Shakespear mentions only one well, and says nothing of the outer tower ; he states that the place is guarded by half a dozen of the Emir of Ha'il's men, who are changed once a year. The wells are walled with masonry and very deep (140-170 metres ; Nolde) : water good and abundant. [At Hayyaniyah a route runs almost S. to Ha'il; see Route No. 4, p. 81.] Dir. SE. 10 m.

Raunkiaer seems to have reduced the total distance to under 40 miles by following an almost straight line between 'Oqair and Hofuf. Passing Suwwdd, described as an extensive area of wild dates, Abu Hd'il, a well in a valley, and a hollow called Faslhan, he entered, at about 8 m., a rough dune tract known as Rasdl 'All, succeeded by a saline plain in which water is obtainable at a depth of a few feet. Rather more than 20 m. from 'Oqair, he passed into a district called Hlsa, with hollows containing wild dates, not long afterwards reaching Jiffir, a country town 5 m. E. of Hofuf. In 1904 Burchardt, on a riding-ass, accompanied an armed caravan which halted for one night on the way. He describes the journey as 4 hrs. through a sandy tract, 9 hrs. over regular sand desert, and a few hours through Hasa oasis.

SE. of Abu Jifan ; thence W.to Riyadh through iK 'Aqalat el-Hameid. It may be assumed that the IK total in general corresponds to Raunkiaer's (about 200 m.), and that the main intermediate si,:; sections are of about the same length (to Wadi Faruq, c. 40 m. ; to first water across Dahanah, fi|i c. 90 m.; on to Riyadh, c. 70 m.); at present, ill however, no complete itinerary has been pub lished.

[The above distances can be regarded as approximate only. They are based on the time apparently taken by Sadlier, on the assumption that the pace was generally 2|- miles an hour. The positions in Hunter's map of Henakiyah, Jebel Mawiyah, Batin el-'Urmah, and Jirzawiyah also rest on this hypothesis. Burckhardt's itinerary gives the time from Medina to Rass as 105 hours, exclusive of halts. His pace appears to have been, in general, about 2^ miles per hour. The distance to be inferred from his time does not therefore differ much from that which appears to be given by Sadlier.

Kheif, situated at the head of Wadi Jedeidah, the first of a series of villages and hamlets passed in this wadi. It is described as ' one of the most important positions in Hejaz, because it is the only way by which caravans can proceed from Mecca, or Medina, to Yambo'' (see Route No. 33, p. 188). Dir. SW. The wadi becomes still narrower, and for some distance the track is dangerously com manded from the hills ; then the wadi straightens and descends sharply. 55 11 Jedeidah, a long straggling village, situated at the end of Wadi Jedeidah ; springs of fairly sweet water.

The village is guarded by a fort with crenellated walls and loop-holes, and there are several watch-towers on the hill-crests along the valley on both sides.ROUTE 27: MEDINA—MECCA P 167 miles, total, stages. There is a small suq, where fair supplies of bread, rice, butter, and cheap grain may be procured. Good water is obtained by digging a few feet below the surface in the bed of the wadi; and a fine spring rises from the base of the hills to the S. There are considerable flocks of sheep and goats, and plantations of dates and bananas. Here the road from Yambo' to Medina (see Route No. 33, p. 188) comes in r. Dir.

Kharmah, a village in a branch wadi of Wddi Safrah. 68 5 Safrah, a village with scattered hamlets built partly on a mountain slope and partly in the bottom of a narrow part of Wadi Safrah ; it is an important market - centre for all the surrounding tribes. A copious stream of tepid water runs down the valley, and there are several other springs and wells. Fruits, cereals, vegetables and stock are raised ; date-groves extend for about 4 m. along the valley. Much honey of the best quality is produced in the neighbourhood, and it forms an important article of trade in the market of Safrah. [The above description of the route between Safrah and Medina should be compared with that given from Burckhardt in Route No. 33, II, pp. 190 ff. It will be noted that though the total distance (68 m.) is the same, the details of distances between certain of the stages are not altogether in accord, which is doubtless due in part to the fact that the lines followed did not coincide throughout. With regard to his journey from Medina to Yambo' (Route No. 33 reversed), Burckhardt himself says : ' The distances of this journey do not exactly agree with those given in coming to Medina ; but I prefer stating them as I found them noted down in my journal.']168 WESTERN ROUTES miles. total, stages.

Nine months' observations are, however, available for San'a in Yemen, and these have been included. Place. Period of observation. Altitude. Lat. N. Lon g.E. Red Sea Coast. Years. Feet.

Low temperatures are common at night, and from the dryness of the air the winds often appear to be far colder than their temperature would indicate. Rain, and even snow, occur occasionally during the passage of depressions coming from the Levant or North Africa in the winter months. In the summer dry northerly and north westerly winds prevail with high day temperatures even on the interior plateau, which rises to about 3,000 ft.METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS 345 In the plateau of Central Arabia summer rains occur at the end of August or the beginning of September, while the low-pressure area extends from North-Western India to the Red Sea. These summer rains also occur in Southern Arabia at least south of 16° N. lat., but become irregular and uncertain in the interior further north. The eastern shore of the Red Sea receives but scanty rain fall, but in the mountains which divide it from the interior brief heavy showers fall almost daily in the summer months, and thunder storms are common. The observations at San'a fairly represent the hill stations of this region. The circulation of air over Arabia is mainly controlled by the low- pressure system over the Persian Gulf in summer, when northerly and north-westerly winds prevail in the north, and down the Red Sea coast, with south-westerly winds over the southern coast. In the winter Eastern Arabia and the Persian Gulf form part of a great high-pressure system round which southerly and south-easterly currents flow, carrying winter rains to Eastern Abyssinia. In Northern Arabia the light winds of the normal circulation are often masked by the shallow depressions which pass eastward from the Mediterranean and Lower Egypt. The chapters descriptive of the various provinces include details of information with regard to climate, for the most part derived from the personal experience of travellers. Such information will be found on the following pages : Hejaz, vol. i, p. 98 f. ; Asir, vol. i, p. 129 f. ; Yemen, vol. i, p. 147 ; Aden, vol. i, p. 182 f. ; Hadhramaut, vol. i, p. 219 f. ; Oman, vol. i, p. 239 ; Koweit, vol. i, p. 285 ; Hasa, vol. i, p. 298 ; Bahrein, vol. i, p. 312 f. ; Nejd, vol. i, p. 350 ; Jebel Shammar, vol. i, p. 376. For general observations on the relation of climate to physical configuration and human welfare, see vol. i, p. 16 f. For the effect of climate upon health, see vol. ii, chapter v, more especially p. 358. In the following pages (346-56) Tables are given from observa tions taken at the stations mentioned on the preceding page, relating to Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Cloud, and Wind.CHAPTER V HYGIENE AND DISEASE r 9 &gt; A lthough the long coast-line of Arabia possesses, relatively, few harbours, those of Yambo' el-Bahr, Jiddah, Hodeidah, Aden, Muscat, and Koweit are important as gateways through which diseases may, and do, enter the country, as they may also arrive by land routes. Borne by ship or caravan, by man, beast, insect, or plant, infections must be watched for and checked at every inlet. The resident population is small for the size of the country, and many of the tribes are nomadic (see vol. I, pp. 18 ff.). The great moving population of pilgrims and traders renders the practice of hygiene difficult in Arabia, and diseases due to cholera germs, typhoid bacilli, and insect parasites follow their track. Dwellers or sojourners in the land have to contend against local conditions such as heat, storms, winds, sand-tempests, &amp;c.; against attacks by wild animals, or injury from snakes and scorpions ; against unfamiliar plants, bearing strong and sharp thorns, which may be poisonous or otherwise hurtful. Diseases such as cholera, enteric fevers, or dysentery, as well as intestinal and other parasites, may lurk in contaminated food or water ; malaria, filaria, typhus, &amp;c., are inoculated by bites of mosquitoes, lice, or other arthropods ; and man spreads among his fellows venereal diseases, ringworm, and other parasites. Against all the above-mentioned evils, and many others to be presently noticed, the individual, be he soldier, sailor, pilgrim, or ordinary traveller, as well as the medical and sanitary officer, must exercise eternal watchfulness and must wage eternal war. General Hygiene. Hygiene is an inclusive term for the science which concerns itself with the preservation of health, and it need hardly be said that, generally speaking, the healthy, cared-for body guided by a healthy mind is less likely to suffer from the effects of climatic conditions and less likely to contract disease than one which is unwisely clothed, fed, or worked, and which suffers from want of cleanliness. This general proposition explains, unfortunately no more than vaguely and in part, why it is that one man may harbour the germs358 HYGIENE AND DISEASE of cholera and certain other diseases, taking no harm himself but being a possible danger to others whose power of resistance is not on a similar level. , ... The individual for whose use this Handbook is issued will pro bably be able to find medical or surgical aid in time of trouble ; but for the general care of the body and its functions every one must be held personallv responsible j and the brief directions contained in this chapter will, if followed, keep men out of hospital. Where medical treatment of diseased conditions is described, it is with a view to render help in emergencies and when medical aid is not available. Meteorological Conditions. In a region where, as m Arabia, the range of temperature is generally high (see above. Chap. IV, Table I, p. 346f.), the effects of heat must be considered. The nights are often cold and in some parts, during the winter months, very cold. There is no regular ' rainy season ' to temper the hot weather, and in most parts of the country the rainfall is scanty and irregular. In the north what rains there are occur during the winter months; in the south slight rain falls during summer and autumn, while in the Yemen mountains there may be considerable rain during the spring and summer months. In many of the desert areas rain rarely falls. In some parts the night dews are heavy (see Vol. I, p. 16 f.). In such a climate the European must defend himself against the direct heat of the sun and also against variations of temperature. Heat will bring about illness directly and indirectly. Directly, as in the case of sudden ' sun fever ' or sun-stroke ; indirectly, as in heat syncope or heat suffocation. Long-continued exposure to great heat may also cause insidious blood changes and anaemia. A hot, dry atmosphere is, as a rule, better tolerated than a hot and damp atmosphere. It is desirable to avoid, if possible, the direct rays of the sun between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. ; but when work has to' be done in the open the head, neck, and spine must be protected by suitable helmets and by means of a pad fixed into the coat. The effects of heat are again referred to in a later section. The body must not be suddenly chilled, and, where the relative temperature varies from day to night through many degrees, warm clothing and blankets should be available for use as required. Fauna injurious to man. As regards geographical distribution along lines laid down by Wallace, Arabia, north of the Tropic of Cancer, is included (with Asia and Africa north of the Sahara) in the Palaearctic division, while that part of the country south of the ' tropic ' comes within the Ethiopian region. Besides the flies, mosquitoes, fleas, worms, &amp;c. 3 mentioned in connexion with variousHYGIENE AND DISEASE 359 diseases, there are other creatures injurious to man, either directly, or indirectly as parasites or as carriers of disease germs. Of these only brief lists can be given. To the former class belong the poisonous snakes. The following kinds are found in Arabia : Cobras, vipers, Echis coloratus, Bitis arietans, Cerastes cornutus, Pseudocerastes sp. ?, Airactaspis sp. ?; and the seas that wash the coasts contain poisonous species of Hi/drophinae, which might be mistaken for eels by careless or ignorant persons. Dryophidae ^ (whip-snakes) are generally supposed to be harmless ; but two species found in the S. and SW. are poisonous (Bury). The teeth ^ in Dryophis are set far back, and venom can only be injected into captured prey. Man, unless careless, has little to fear. F lies . In addition to common species resembling the house-fly, a species of Glossina, Gl. tachinoides, is found in SW. Arabia ; fortunately it does not carry or convey the sleeping-sickness infection. M osquitoes . The following Culicine or Anopheline mosquitoes may be carriers of disease germs ; Culex fatigans {quinquefasciatus )—dengue and diseases due to Filar id Bancrofti, elephantiasis, chyluria, &amp;c. Anopheles maculipennis —filaria and malaria. A. (Myzorhynchus) sinensis (var. ?)—filaria and malaria. A. [M.) Rossi —filaria. A. (if.) funestus —filaria and malaria. Mansonia titillans and M. uniformis —filaria. Anopheles Wellcomei (Aden); A. squamosus, S. and SW. : A. Pharoensis. The following species are known to convey the Plasmodium of malaria and may exist on the coastal regions of Arabia ; Anopheles {Myzorhynchus) Listoni,A. (M.) culicifacies, A. {M.) bar- birostris, A. {Neo-cellia) Stephensi,A. (A r .) Willmorii, A. {Nyssorhyn- chus) Tlieobaldi, and A. (Ny.) fuliginosus. F leas , which do or may convey the bacillus of plague or cause injury: Xenopsylla cheopis (tropical rat flea) ; plague. Ceratophyllus fasciatus (cosmopolitan rat flea); plague. Dermatophilus penetrans (the ' Jigger' or ' Chigoe' flea). B ugs, Cimex rotundatus, suspected carrier of Leishmania, and probably typhus, leprosy, and relapsing fever. L ice, Pediculus humanus {vestimen)ti, conveyer of typhus in fection and possibly of other disease germs.BT'T 360 HYGIENE AND DISEASE T icks, Argas Permcus (fowl tick), though not known to carry auv germs hurtful to man, is such a pest along the Persian Gulf that it has been known to compel people to quit their houses. Ornithodorus Savignyi conveys the spirochaetes of relapsing fever • Ixodes ricinus, very common in Arabia, is responsible for diseases due to Piroplasma. C rustaceans . Various species of Cyclops, which carry the larval forms of the guinea-worm. M ollusca . Species of Katayama, Bullinus, and Planorbis are known as hosts for cercaria of Bilharzia (Schistosomum) kaematohia, and several kinds of Limnaea harbour the larva of ' flukes Our knowledge of the arthropods and worms, &amp;c., of Arabia is very small. It is to be hoped that travellers and civil and military officials will collect new or rare species and send them to England.' G eneral H ygiene and some C ommon D iseases Within the last forty years the true causes of many infective diseases have been discovered and proved, and many new methods have been devised to safeguard the health of men suddenly ex posed to the risk of tropical diseases. Malaria, yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, typhus, plague, are at the present time so well understood' and the precautions to be taken against them have been so far worked out, that a man need not be greatly afraid of them—if only he will be careful. But, of course, he must not only be careful to obey the ordinary rules for the avoidance of infection ; he must also be careful to keep himself thoroughly fit and up to the mark. If he impairs his health by any bad habit or excess, or by any neglect of himself, his natural power of resistance becomes less. Proper diet and clothing, avoidance of chill, attention to the teeth and the skin and the bowels, all are of great importance to him. Men ought to be encouraged to believe that, if only they will be careful, they can really do a great deal to protect themselves from infection, ior the fear of disease may get more hold on a man than the fear of dying in action. Losses in action and losses by disease', says Lieut.-Col. Melville, are very different things. . . . Disease takes the heart out of men in a way that mere death on the battlefield does not.' Our present knowledge of the causes of the infective diseases comes from the work of Pasteur (1822-95) and his followers. It was Pasteur Avho discovered and proved that the infective diseases are distinct species of microscopic germs, multiplying in the body, yid bre*®!!

He discovered how to isolate the germs of this or that disease, and how to grow them in ' pure culture outside the living body, miles away from a patient, all by themselves, in sterilized broth or on sterilized jelly, in a flask or a test-tube. From this discovery came the whole series of discoveries, how to bring down, point by point, the virulence of a pure culture, and how to render man, or animals, immune against this or that disease, by treating them with graduated doses of germs at low virulence, or of dead germs, or of the distinctive poisons brewed by germs. For example : sheep and cattle are protected against anthrax by graduated doses of anthrax-germs at low virulence. Man is pro tected against typhoid by graduated doses of dead typhoid-germs. These protective substances go by the name of vaccines, because of their analogy with ordinary vaccination against small-pox. Antitoxins differ from vaccines, since animals are used in the preparation of antitoxins. For example ; diphtheria. If a horse be treated with graduated doses of the poison brewed by diph theria-germs in pure culture, the horse becomes in time immune against diphtheria. Its blood, fighting the poison, the ' toxin manufactures the ' antitoxin ', the natural antidote to the toxin. If the serum, the clear part of the blood of this horse, be adminis tered to a child with diphtheria, it will reinforce the antitoxin which the child's own blood is manufacturing, and in this way will help the child to pull through. It can also be used, not only to cure a child already attacked by diphtheria, but to immunize a child that has been exposed to diphtheria. As it is with diphtheria-antitoxin, so it is with tetanus-antitoxin. The germs of tetanus (lockjaw) live in the surface-soil: in dust, gravel, earth, and especially in soil heavily manured. If a horse be gradually immunized against tetanus, its blood is able to im munize a man, or another horse, against the disease. In places where the surface-soil is badly infected with tetanus, a man re ceiving a wound, with particles of mud or earth in it, ought cer tainly to be thus protected as soon as possible after the injury. The method is used also to protect valuable horses, either after a wound or before some operation of veterinary surgery. These two discoveries of a protective and curative serum for diphtheria and tetanus have saved thousands of lives. Vaccina tion against the Enterica bacilli has also proved of great value. Pasteur's work, also, inspired Lister (1827-1912) to study the true causes of wound-infection, and to discover the antiseptic treatment of wounds. Lister's first use of carbolic acid, to362 HYGIENE AND DISEASE ' destroy the germs of putrefaction' in a compound fracture, was in 1865, at the Royal Glasgow Infirmary. But the dis covery guided men of science to the present knowledge of the transmission of diseases, from animal to animal, or from animal to man, or from man to man, by insects. We know, now, that rat-fleas convey plague from rats to man ; tsetse-flies convey sleeping-sickness, lice and ticks and bugs convey relapsing fever, lice convey typhus, sand-flies convey sand-fly fever, bugs may convey leprosy, and mosquitoes {Anopheles or Gulex or Stego- myia) convey malaria, dengue and yellow fever. Just as the dog is the intermediate host of a common tapeworm between man and man, and the fresh-water snail, in Egypt, is the intermediate host of Bilharzia, so the Anopheles mosquito carries malaria, and the Stegomyia mosquito yellow fever. And as the tapeworm has two alternating cycles of life, one in the dog and the other in man, so the germs of malaria have two alternating cycles of life—two elaborate and amazing states of existence—one in the stomach of the mosquito, the other in the blood of man. Our present knowledge of the ways of transmission of infective diseases has vastly increased our power of protecting ourselves against them. We have left off thinking that they can ' come of themselves ' ; we have left off calling them ' putrid exhalations' or miasmata, as if they were no more avoidable than the climate or the weather ; we know that they are due to definite living germs, and that we cannot have the diseases unless we get the germs into us under conditions which suit them. But, of course, if a man is careless of himself, or if he is run down' by some previous illness, or by exposure, or from intemperance, or over-fatigue, then the germs take the advantage which he offers to them. General Rules o£ Health. Food. In ordinary civilian life in the tropics a man requires less meat and less fats than he usually takes in this country. But no hard-and-fast rule applies. Many of the natives of the tropics are in a state of chronic starvation; but the folly of intentionally placing white men in the same condition is apparent. The com parative immunity of Englishmen to the infectious diseases that decimate the natives of Asia is due, in part, at least, to their being better fed on nitrogenous food. Still, rice and vegetables are a valuable adjunct to meat-rations, but they must be well cooked, and freshly cooked, not kept from over-night. No uncooked vegetables must be eaten ; and fruits must not be eaten uncookedI HYGIENE AND DISEASE 363 unless they are peeled, or very thoroughly washed, for they are ; v likely to be contaminated with dust, or with handling. When y obtained from local sources, they are very apt to convey disease, 'vrV since irrigating waters may be infected, while the oriental gardener t uses human excrement as a fertilizer. Therefore, all native vege- rt , tables should be cooked, and such fruits as the water-melon should ; never be eaten at all in a cholera district (see further p. 366). i Fruits, handled by unclean natives, should be plunged for an st instant in boiling salt water before peeling and eating. This does not injure the ordinary thick-skinned varieties, and greatly dimin- ishes the risk of disease from this source. In the choice of rations, care must be taken that they can be easily r ai! carried, easily divided and distributed, and easily and quickly cooked. They must include a sufficient supply of salt, which is : needed for health in tropical countries. Cheese, bolted, is hard to ! digest ; but cheese thoroughly masticated and eaten slowly, and 1 ! not too much at a time, is excellent food. Chocolate also is excellent food, but may tend to make a man thirsty. Good bacon is one of miJ1 the best of all foods, but unless it be tinned it does not keep very well in the tropics. Tinned foods, of a good brand, may keep for a 1® a y ear i n the tropics, but are not to be trusted after that. When iMik the contents of a tin go bad, they tend to produce gases which tkeclii bulge the tin, and give it a resonant note when it is tapped. Some firms have a trick of puncturing these 'blown tins', reheating the getltf. contents, and resoldering the tins. No blown or twice-soldered tins should be used for food. ^is'rit; For extra rations, for a body of men exhausted by hard work, linteip Lt.-Col. Melville says, 'In my opinion, the demands imposed by wMki increased exertion should be met by the special addition to the food stuff of some foodstuff which needs the minimum of preparation, to which the soldier is unaccustomed, and which will possess there fore the advantage of novelty. It is not much satisfaction to a man a mail % who has lived on tinned beef and biscuit for a fortnight, when he scoitij arrives very tired at the end of a long day's march, to be presented isoftkt with an extra half-tin of the former and four more of the latter, of inteik The thing which really counts is not how much food the man receives ent, ft from the supply authorities, but the amount of that food which he isdise® can turn to useful purpose.' 11 0 thai): It goes without saying that any food left exposed to flies is thereby ve getakls exposed to infection. be welli Diet should be varied and fresh meat, &amp;c., preferred to tinned jug articles. ' Do not eat much, but eat many things ; there is safety eaten mi i n variety, danger in monotony.' (Duclaux.)364 HYGIENE AND DISEASE Drink. If we arrange in order the sources of water -supply, from the safest to the most dangerous, the list is as follows : Spring water, deep-well water, upland surface water, stored rain-water ordinary surface-water from cultivated lands, river-water to which sewage gains access, shallow-well water. Certainly there is such a thing as pure drinking-water. But natives in the tropics have so many ways of polluting the surface-soil and the water-supply, that the only sure protection against water-borne cholera or typhoid is to have all drinking-water boiled, or chemically treated, or both. Filters, mostly, are troublesome things, and easily get clogged. If the water be turbid, it must be filtered or strained before, not after, boiling. Drinking-water ought to be not merely heated, but really boiled for five minutes ; and it is essential to see for oneself that this is done, as natives cannot be trusted to carry out instructions which they consider unnecessary. In places where the water is very unpalatable, it is best taken, when in camp, in the form of hot tea ; and, even when travelling light, a ' thermos-flask' does not take up much room and would add to one's comfort, especially on night-marches. The flat taste of cold boiled water may be im proved by shaking up the water, in a corked bottle, with fresh air; or by the use of a ' sparklet' bottle. And, of course, clean water, if it be stored in unclean flasks, ceases to be clean water. No alcoholic drinks of any kind should be taken between meals, or while a man is at work during the heat of the day. Probably a very small amount of stimulant, taken with the evening meal, helps digestion, or at any rate does not harm a man. Other Precautions. All clothing must be light and loose, and the utmost care should be taken of the skin of the feet. For pro tection against chill, a ' cholera-belt' will be found useful at night. For protection against sunstroke, the cap or sun-helmet should have a red or orange lining, and a three-inch strip or pad of stuff of the same colour should be sewn inside the shirt, to cover the spine. For protection against disorders of the stomach and bowels, such as may lower a man's resistance to this or that infection, the mouth and the teeth must be kept very clean : and the best mouth wash is weak carbolic lotion, about 1 in 200. For smoking, a pipe is better than cigarettes. Against malaria, a man can protect himself, not only with a mosquito-net, but with preventive doses of quinine—5 grains daily, or 10 to 15 grains twice a week, while he is in a very ' malarial' district. ' If for any reason says Manson, ' quinine is not tolerated, that individual is unsuitable for residence in tropical countries.' Tasteless quinine can be taken by most people.HYGIENE AND DISEASE 365 S hort N otes on some T ropical D iseases Many tropical diseases need not be described, as they do not occur in Arabia. Yellow fever, sleeping sickness, beri-beri, kala-azar, do not occur. Plague has visited Arabian ports from time to time, but does not become endemic as a rule. The non-tropical diseases, such as scarlet fever, diphtheria, and the venereal diseases, are much the same in Arabia as in our own country. Some of the diseases in the following list are rare in Arabia, but are not unknown, and therefore have been included in the list. Boils. This troublesome complaint is common enough every where, but may be especially troublesome to white men in tropical countries. It is a localized infection of the skin, not a ' blood- disease and the infection is spread, by the discharge from a boil, to neighbouring points of the skin. Boils should not be poulticed, but should be dressed with antiseptic lotions ; and the surrounding skin must be kept scrupulously clean. A boil just forming may sometimes be cut short by an incision, getting three or four drops of pure carbolic acid well into it with a finely-sharpened piece of wood. Chiggers. These are not unknown on the shore of the Persian Gulf, and are due to sand-fleas, which are insects like ordinary fleas, but rather smaller. The female burrows into the skin of any creature that it finds, and there becomes distended with blood and eggs, forming an inflamed swelling about the size of a pea. When the eggs have been expelled, there remains a little sore, which may ulcerate. To avoid ' chiggers avoid walking barefoot, and bathe and examine the feet from time to time. If a black dot, or a little rounded swelling, be found, generally under a nail, the right treat ment is to get it out whole, with a sharp clean needle ; some natives are very expert at this. The spot, after treatment, must be properly dressed. Cholera. The ' comma bacillus', the distinctive sign of the disease, was discovered in Egypt, by Koch, in 1883 ; but there are many varieties or strains of this germ. The incubation-period of the disease may be only a few hours, or may be so much as ten days, but the usual period is from 3 to 6 days. Protection against cholera, in the presence of an epidemic, includes (1) immediate and strict enforcement of rules of sanitation, and isolation of cases and of suspected cases ; (2) the use of Haffkine's protective vaccine ; (3) the quiet unremitting care of each man for his own personal health. On this last point, Manson writes as follows : ' During cholera epidemics, great care should be exercised to preserve the general health ; at the same time, anything like panic® ' ■' 366 HYGIENE AND DISEASE or apprehension mnst be sedulously discouraged. Fatigue, chill excess—particularly dietetic or alcoholic excess—are to be carefully avoided. Visits to cholera districts should be postponed if possible seeing that the new-comer is specially liable to contract the disease! Unripe fruit, over-ripe fruit,' shell-fish,' food in a state of decomposi tion, and everything tending to upset the digestive organs and to cause intestinal catarrh, are dangerous. Melons, cucumbers, and the like, deserve the evil reputation they have acquired. Purgatives —particularly saline purgatives—unless very specially indicated, should never be taken at these times. All drinking-water, and ali water in which dishes and everything used in the preparation and serving of food are washed, should be boiled. 1 Filters—except perhaps the Pasteur-Chamberland filter—are not for the most part to be relied on ; in many instances they are more likely to con taminate the water passed through them than to purify it. 'All food should be protected from flies. ' Diarrhoea occurring during cholera epidemics should be promptly and vigorously treated. During cholera epidemics it is customary to establish depots where sedative and astringent remedies for the treatment of diarrhoea are dispensed gratuitously. Experience seems to encourage the belief that by such means incipient cholera may be aborted during the stage of premonitory diarrhoea. Of the various drugs used with this view, chlorodyne and brandy are the most popular. Whether true cholera can be cut short in this way or not, it is certainly in the highest degree advisable at such a time to neglect no case of diarrhoea, but to insist on rest, warmth, and the greatest prudence in feeding, in all cases of intestinal catarrh or irritation.' Warmth, stimulants, sips of iced water or soda-water, gentle friction, morphia, the use of large intravenous or subcutaneous injections of saline fluid, and the giving of permanganate of potas sium, are the chief lines of the treatment of cholera. All food should be withheld while the disease is active ; and the return to ordinary food must be very gradually and carefully managed. The average mortality is about 50 per cent, of the cases. Patients after recovery may still carry the germs in their bodies, and 1 The Journal of the R.A.M.C., ii, 1914, contains a review of a lecture, by an Austrian doctor, on his experiences in Adrianople during the Balkan War of 1912. ' He was agreeably surprised, on accepting an invitation to dine with a Bulgarian artillery regiment, to find all the dishes served up piping hot, the bread steaming, and all the plates dipped in boiling water before being placed on the table. The colonel explained that lie had taken these steps since one of his officers had succumbed to cholera.'

All discharges from cholera patients must be immediately burned, and all linen immediately disinfected. Every possible precaution must be taken, even after convalescence, to prevent contamination of table-utensils, water, or food. The patient may become a ' carrier Dengue (dandy, or breakbone fever). A fever lasting a week or ten days, with a measly rash and severe rheumatic pains in bones and joints. The usual incubation-period is from one to three days. The onset is usually sudden. For the first two days, the face and eyes are suffused, and the whole body may be flushed ; temperature 103 to 105 or even 106° F.; and the patient suffers much pain in limbs and loins, and feels very ill. For the next two or three days he feels fairly comfortable, and may even want to be up and about ; this change, from the first to the second stage of the fever, is usually marked by a sweating, or a nose-bleeding, or a loose action of the bowels. Finally, comes a slight transient return of fever, with a branny rash, somewhat like measles ; it usually starts on the hands and forearms, spreads over the trunk, and is followed by slightly scurfy desquamation. The mortality of dengue, among healthy men, is nil ; but it may leave a man ' run down ' for some time. There is evidence that it is conveyed by mosquitoes (Culex). The germ has not yet been discovered. There is no way of cutting short the fever, and no specific treat ment. Neither quinine, nor stimulants, are of any advantage. Induce free perspiration. The best protective measure is the use of a mosquito-net. Diarrhoeal disorders are common in Arabia, This word 4 diarrhoea ' is merely Greek for a flux or flowing-through ; it does not necessarily imply any specific disease ; and a mere looseness of the bowels for a day may be nothing more than Nature's way of getting rid of some unwholesome article of diet. In Arabia, diarrhoeal disorders are among the most frequent of maladies. These epidemic diarrhoeas are true infective diseases, conveyed in food or drink ; the summer diarrhoea of children, for example, is not merely ' too many plums ', but a result of infected food or milk ; flies doubtless help to spread the infection. Accordingly, the precautions against epidemic diarrhoea are similar to the precautions against cholera (seep. 365). Dysentery. An infection, mostly water-borne, of the mucous membrane of ^he large intestine, giving rise to pain, griping, frequent desire to go to stool, and the passage of frequent small stools368 HYGIENE AND DISEASE containing slime, or slime and blood. The suffering is sometimes intense. As the disease goes on, the bowel tends to become ulcer ated. In some cases, dysentery is followed by relapses, or by chronic dysentery, or by abscess of the liver. Three principal factors are at work in a case of dysentery; (1) the preliminary influences—such as chill, bad food, purgatives, intestinal worms, and intemperance—which lower the natural resistance of the large intestine to infection ; (2) the actual invasion of the intestine by the germs of the disease; (3) the subsequent invasion of the intestine by the ordinary germs of suppuration, which tend to form ulcers. There are two chief types or forms of dysentery. In the one, the intestine is invaded by bacteria ; in the other, by protozoa. We call the one, bacillary dysentery ; and the other, amoebic dysentery. The two forms may co-exist in this or that case, as it were by chance, but the distinction is none the less valid. Bacillary dysentery is epidemic dysentery ; it occurs in all latitudes. Amoebic dysentery is endemic rather than epidemic ; it occurs only in warm climates, or in the warm season of temperate climates. Amoebic dysentery mostly commences insidiously, without marked fever ; it is generally subacute or chronic in its course; it is apt to recur or relapse ; it is often associated with congestion of the liver, and sometimes causes abscess of the liver. It rapidly improves under treatment with ipecacuanha, or, better still, with emetine, which is the alkaloid of ipecacuanha. If emetine is not available saturated solution of sulphate of magnesia with Tt. opii n \xv to each ounce is very useful. Dose : one teaspoonful every half-hour for 2 hours ; then every 2 hours. Bacillary (epidemic) dysentery is mostly acute in character, often with initial fever ; it runs its course, and if properly treated is not apt to relapse. It is cured by emetine ; and good results hafe been obtained with a specific antitoxin. We owe the discovery of this antitoxin to Shiga, a Japanese man of science, who also discovered the most common bacillus, Dysenteria Shiga. Protection against dysentery mostly consists in securing a pure water-supply ; in the avoidance of all ' predisposing causes'; in correcting either constipation or diarrhoea ; in the isolation of cases and of suspects ; and in careful sanitation, especially regard ing the disposal of foecal matter and the keeping down of flies, Where a great number of persons live in close proximity, dysentery is very readily spread. Guinea-worm {Dracunculus) is not unknown in Arabian coast towns. This worm, like many other parasitic worms, has twolet 4 j Jr J' H ®,kfc iofc, £ : )rtliatt : iTilfe Wffi, fc.

If this minute creature gets into the drinking-water, the embryo worms are set free in the stomach, and one or more of them may finally make its way to the surface of the body, just under the skin. Here the female worm may grow many inches long, so that it looks like a piece of string under the skin. It pierces the skin at one point, and discharges its young into water (when the skin is bathed in water),—hoping, as it were, that the water may contain Cyclops, which will give the young worms a start in life ! Thus, the only risk is in the drinking of unboiled or unstrained water, with a live Cyclops in it, containing the live young of the worm. There are well-devised ways of dealing with the adult worm under the skin. Leprosy, a very slowly-progressive disease, gradually affecting the skin and the fibrous tissues, or the nerves, and finally leading to severe disfigurement. The actual germs of leprosy were dis covered by Hansen, in 1874. They have some resemblance to the germs of tubercle ; and there are points of resemblance between the two diseases. It is not fully known how the disease is acquired ; but there is some evidence that it may be conveyed by bugs. The old fear of lepers was exaggerated ; a man may live and work among them for years, and take no harm. Malaria. The cause of malaria is a protozoal organism, which was discovered, in 1880, in the blood of a malarial patient by Laveran, a French army surgeon. In 1894, Manson, after his discovery that the mosquito is the intermediate host of filarial disease, advanced a similar theory of malaria—that the mosquito is its intermediate host between man and man. In 1898, Ross, after three years' work, proved the truth of this theory. During 1899-1901, ' malaria expeditions from our own country and from Germany, were incessantly going out to the tropics ; Italy also was hard at work. Crucial experiments were made by men on them selves, in India, Italy, New York, and London. Two of these many experiments may be recalled here :— (1) In 1900, a wooden hut was set up in the Roman Campagna, in a water-logged jungly bit of the district, intensely malarial, a place ' where the permanent inhabitants all suffer from malarial disease, and where the farm-labourers, who come from healthy parts of Italy to reap the harvest, after a short time all contract fever'. The hut was made mosquito-proof with netting and fine wire screens. In this mosquito-proof hut. Dr. Low, Dr. Sambon, and others lived for about three months—all through the ' malaria ARABIA H ao370 HYGIENE AND DISEASE season ' ; they protected their faces and hands with veils and gloves ; they took no quinine ; they simply kept off the mosquitoes ; and not one of them had a touch of malaria. (2) In 1900 also, mosquitoes fed on a case of 'benign tertian' fever in a hospital in Rome were consigned, by the British Embassy, to the London School of Tropical Medicine ; and two persons there let themselves be bitten by them. In each case, malaria showed itself ; and their blood was found to contain the very same type of the malarial germs which was in the blood of the patient in Rome, Malaria is, in fact, mosquitoes ; not all mosquitoes, but certain species of the genus Anopheles. The germs of the disease pass through two very complex and wonderful series of changes, one in the blood of man, the other in the stomach of the mosquito. Kill all mosquitoes and you include Anopheles. Ever since 1900, the work has been to keep down malaria by keeping down Anopheles. The female lays its eggs on stagnant water—pools and puddles, ditchwater, marshes, sluggish streams, uncovered wells and cisterns, and chance collections of rain-water. Therefore, the larger surfaces of water are filmed with kerosene, so that the larvae cannot breathe ; puddles are swept out, ditches are drained and set running, tanks and waterbutts are covered, and the surface-soil is tidied and cleared of all the rubbish that catches rain water. The breaking-up of the haunts of Anopheles is the breaking- up of malaria. In Greece and Italy, Egypt, Africa, India, and above all in the Panama zone, the reduction of malaria by simple measures of this kind has been recorded. 1 But where a considerable portion of the native population have malaria in their blood—the children, especially, are likely to have it—and where sanitation is hardly known, the risk of malaria to white men who are new to the country is great. Dr. Bagshawe, Director of the Tropical Diseases Bureau, writing of the African tropics, says : ' Always use a mosquito net. This may seem a counsel of per fection. ' On the one hand, the claims of campaigning may make it appear difficult to carry such an article in one's kit, and on the other hand there are places where a net seems, to one unversed in tropical hygiene, unnecessary ; moreover, in the hotter districts it is un pleasant. To this the reply may be made : A net need not weigh much, and will pack into small compass ; and except on high levels say 8,000 ft. or more—there is always risk that a few malaria- carrying mosquitoes may be present, though unobserved, and bite 1 Sanitation in Panama, Genl. Gorgas, U.S.A. Medical Service.HYGIENE AND DISEASE 371 the unprotected sleeper. The net protects the user from the mos quitoes which convey malaria and filarial blood-worms, as well as from snakes and ticks. Native servants will find a way of fixing it up in camp, and this must be done before dark. The edges should be tucked under the mattress, not allowed to hang down to the ground. Care should be taken to kill any mosquitoes which enter with the sleeper, and to prevent any part of the body resting against the net, which should always be stretched tight. When holes appear, which they are sure to do, the tissue surrounding the hole should be caught up and tied round with string, so as to close the aperture completely. A net with holes is nothing but a mosquito-trap. The careful and intelligent use of a mosquito-net is the first essential of health in Tropical Africa.' Other protective measures are : (1) the choice of a dry camping- ground, at a fairly high level, free from stagnant waters, and at least a mosquito's flight away—say a quarter or half a mile—from a native village ; (2) special care, in the evening, to protect face, hands, and ankles against mosquitoes ; (3) the use of quinine as a protective drug. Note, that quinine is not a mere ' tonic ' : it has a direct specific action on the Plasmodium malariae, such as salvarsan has on the spirochaetes of syphilis. Blackwater fever, which used to be regarded either as a rare form of malaria, or as a result of too much quinine, is now held to be a separate disease, due to a special infection, or possibly a parasitized Plasmodium, but usually occurring in old malarial cases. It may lie latent in a man, till fatigue, or chill, or perhaps an unusual dose ~ of quinine, makes it flare up. The onset, in most cases, is sudden, with shivering and pain, and a high temperature; the skin may be ■ jaundiced ; and the urine is dark-red or almost black, due to the presence of altered blood, sasefc Ophthalmia. This general word is used of all forms of inflam mation of the surface of the eye. In all tropical countries, neglect . of cleanliness and sanitation makes ophthalmia terribly common, especially among the children. Dust and dirt and the glare of the ■ sun favour infection ; and flies carry it on their feet from case to . - case. In gonorrhoeal ophthalmia, a man may convey the germs of gonorrhoea to his eyes by rubbing them with unwashed fingers. Oriental Sore ('Aleppo boil', 'Baghdad boil', ' Delhi boil'). ' ^ l oca li z ed infection of one or more points of skin, causing a very I®! 1 indolent ulcer. The germs which cause it resemble those of a con- - stitutional disease of the tropics, called kala-azar ; and belong to he the genus Leishmania. Moreover, it is undoubtedly conveyed by u a biting insect. I Dr. Wenyon, who made experiments with it on a a 2fever, eially i 372 HYGIENE AND DISEASE himself in Mesopotamia, has proved that the germs cannot find their way through unbitten or unbroken skin. The sore is trouble some and unsightly rather than painful or dangerous. Protection is afforded by care of the skin, attention to abrasions, avoidance of direct contagion, and avoidance of vermin. Plague hardly needs to be considered here ; for there has been no epidemic in Arabia for many years, and certainly there is none now. The cause of plague, the Bacillus pestis, was discovered by Kitasato and Yersin, in 1894, during the epidemic in Hong Kong. The disease is common to rats and man, and is conveyed, by rat-fleas, from the rat to the man. The possibility of other ways of trans mission cannot be absolutely excluded ; and the ' pneumonic ' type of plague is highly infectious, direct from man to man. It should be watched for at the various ports, and the passage of rats from ships to shore should be prevented. In time of plague in a district, the use of Haffkine's protective vaccine is of very great value : but, of course, the first line of defence consists in the utmost strictness of sanitation, quarantine, isolation, care of food-stuffs, destruction of rats, &amp;c. Prickly Heat {Lichen tropicus). A fine, close-set, extensive, papular and vesicular rash, causing intense itching. It is generally thought to be a direct result of heat and sweating. Scratching may further infect the skin and cause boils. In some cases the eruption may last for many weeks, now better, now worse. Anything causing perspiration may make it worse. With cooler weather, it disappears of itself. Preparations such as lanolin, glycerine of borax,' glycola,' and dusting-powder, give relief. The use of strong soaps should be avoided. Scrubb's Ammonia in the bath gives relief. Relapsing Fever (louse fever, African tick fever, famine fever, Spirillosis). A widely distributed fever, occurring among crowded communities especially when ill-fed, due to germs which from their spiral outline are called spirilla or spirochaetes. It is distinguished by rapid onset, rapid subsidence after a few days, and recurrence a few days later. It may recur many times. The germs are trans mitted by body vermin. Relapsing fever is a very old disease: it is clearly described by Hippocrates (fifth century a.d .). The germs were discovered by Obermeier in 1873. The transmission by ticks was discovered, about 1904, by Philip Ross and Milne in Uganda, and Dutton and Todd on the Congo. The transmission by lice was discovered by Mackie, Nicolle, and others, about 1907. In Egypt, Algiers, Europe, and India, either lice or bugs are the offenders. defines it i Quinine has no appreciable influence on relapsing fever. From atmosphen the likeness of the spirochaetes of relapsing fever to the spirochaetes fever, com use— HYGIENE AND DISEASE 373 of syphilis—not that the two diseases have any sort of common origin—Ehrlich's discovery of salvarsan for syphilis was tried for the treatment of relapsing fever, with excellent results. Protection against body vermin is protection against relapsing fever. The clothing next the skin must be carefully searched, espe cially at the seams, and must be boiled or ironed, or dabbed with kerosene, as occasion may require. A mosquito net can keep out bugs and ticks. A bed well off the ground, with string soaked in kerosene wound round its feet, and pyrethrum powder or Keating's powder dusted inside the sheets, is good protection : and a light at night is also useful. Infested persons and places—rest-houses of caravans and native huts—must be avoided. Sand-fly Fever (phlebotomus fever, three days' fever, Chitral fever). Sand-flies are very minute, delicate, long-legged, yellowish or brownish midges. They are to be found in most tropical and sub-tropical countries: genus Phlebotomus, and many species. They hatch out on damp surfaces, such as the walls of cellars and latrines and crevices of damp earth. They convey a fever (germs not discovered) which lasts only three or four days. The incubation period varies from one to six days ; the onset is sudden, there are no complications, and the mortality is nil. Sand-flies can pass through the meshes of a mosquito net. It is said that a bright light, by attracting the flies, affords some protection at night. Effects of Heat. It is generally held that the conditions which are called sunstroke, heat-stroke, &amp;c., may be classified under three principal forms, but of course they do not absolutely exclude each other ; (1) ' Heat-exhaustion.' A man in perfect health, suitably clothed, or half-stripped, and not overworked, can stand, as we all know, exposure to very great heat : for example, glass-blowers, sugar- boilers, and stokers. But a man over-fatigued, or with health impaired by malaria or intemperance or any other bad influence, may faint from exposure to heat, either in the sun or in the shade. In a simple faint from heat-exhaustion a man lies quiet, with face pale, skin chilly, pulse weak, breathing soft (not noisy), temperature not raised ; he may soon come round, perhaps with a very bad headache. The treatment of these cases must be gently stimulant, not depressing : no violent cold douching. (2) ' Siriasis.' This Greek word for 'sunstroke' has come into use again for what seems to be truly a tropical disease. Manson deflnes it as an acute disease, developing in the presence of high atmospheric temperature, and characterized by sudden very high fever, coma, and intense congestion of the lungs, ' It is not met374 HYGIENE AND DISEASE with on the high seas, although it is well known on ships in the narrow, land-locked Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.' It may have premonitory symptoms, as danger signals—lassitude, headache, intolerance of light, irritability of the bladder; then comes restlessness or wild delirium, which very rapidly is followed by complete unconsciousness ; face suffused, breathing noisy, pulse very quick, skin burning hot, and temperature rushing up to a height which may prove fatal within a few hours. For these cases the most urgent immediate treatment is cold douching, cold pack, or ice pack, till the temperature is down to 102, but not longer ; then a warm blanket, and perhaps stimulants, but not strychnine. Quinine must be given if the patient has had malaria. If the breathing threatens to stop, artificial respiration should be done. Bleeding will relieve the severe congestion. (3) In a third, ill defined, group of cases it seems that certain rays of the light of the sun have a direct effect on the tissues, and may even cause, in some cases, meningitis. The symptoms are those of meningitis, or what is vaguely called ' brain fever '; and the treatment is on the lines of the treatment of meningitis : abso lute quiet in a cool, darkened room ; the head shaved, and kept cool 1 ; bromides, light diet, no stimulants. Enteric Fevers (which include typhoid and the paratyphoid fevers) The germs of typhoid fever were discovered in 1880-1. The first use of protective ' inoculation ' in this country was made by Sir Almroth Wright and Sir David Semple, at Netley Hospital, in 1896. Regarding the value of this treatment in the present war, the figures given in January 1916 were as follows : Among our Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium about 95 per cent, have been protected against typhoid fever ; the annual average being about 90 per cent. The annual admission ratio per 1,000 is more than nine times greater among the non-protected than among the protected. Among the non-protected it is 9-1 per 1,000. Among the protected it is I per 1,000. The death-rate is thirty-one times greater. Among the non-protected it is 1-84 per 1,000. Among the protected it is 0 06 per 1,000. Typhoid fever, among a large body of men, may be spread by flies, settling first on typhoid discharges and then on food or milk Also patients recovered from typhoid may still carry the germs inside them, and pass them in their discharges, and convey them on soiled fingers. No such person should be employed on the prepara tion or serving of food to troops till careful microscopic examination of his discharges has proved that he is not a ' typhoid-carrier InHYGIENE AND DISEASE the presence of typhoid it is impossible to be too clean, or too careful over all measures of sanitation. There are two kinds of paratyphoid germs, called A and B. The methods of spreading, and the risk of carriers, and the precautiona against infection, are the same in paratyphoid as in typhoid. Paratyphoid A fever is milder in type than either typhoid or para typhoid B fever and is common in the East. Typhus Fever. Sir William Jenner, about 1850, proved that typhoid and typhus are two wholly different diseases. Typhus is conveyed by lice, and cannot spread in clean and wholesome sur roundings. Note that the Germans use the word typhus for what we in this country call typhoid and Fleck-typhus for typhus. Undulant Fever (Mediterranean fever) is more common in Arabian seaports than is generally supposed. It is due to a specific microbe which occurs in greatest abundance in the milk of infected goats. All risk of this fever may be prevented by the avoidance of raw goat's milk. Small-pox. Endemic, and sometimes there are severe outbreaks Every one ought to have been vaccinated against small-pox within three or four years of coming to Arabia. Venereal Diseases. Both syphilis and gonorrhoea are common. Syphilis does not seem to be of a specially virulent kind in Arabia, as it is in some parts of Africa. Remember that syphilis can be and is spread by the saliva. Chancres on the hps may be produced from smoking the water-pipe {arkllah). This pipe has only one stem, and perhaps as many as ten or twelve people smoke from the same mouthpiece, one after the other. It is not a clean habit, and there is certainly a danger of getting a chancre on the lips. Such pipes are very nice to smoke if you have your own mouthpiece. Pyorrhoea alveolaris, or serious inflammation of the gums, is very common in Arabia. The inflammation is caused by microbes which infect the mouth. It is common in Arabia because of the terrible amount of dust. The gums become swollen and very red, and the breath becomes foul. An antiseptic mouth-wash—boracic acid, or carbolic acid 1 in 100—ought to be used, or the disease becomes very difficult to treat and many teeth may be lost. Parasitic Worms. (1) Guinea-worm. Fairly common in some coast towns of Arabia. Natives try to drag the worm out of their feet by rolling the worm, as it protrudes through the skin, round a stick, very slowly; but this is not a good way, as the worm is likely to break, and then myriads of young escape and a severe inflammation is set up. Douching the part with water will very often bring the whole worm out. But the best way is to inject a solution of cor-37G HYGIENE AND DISEASE rosive sublimate, 1 in 1 ,000, into the body of the worm when she protrudes. Prevention : heating the water to 100° F., or adding a little bicarbonate of potash to it, kills off the embryo worms. But again—Don't drink unboiled water. (2) Bilharzia is some times found in Arabia. This is a small fluke-like worm, which, if swallowed, makes its way to the bladder and sets up inflammation, and the patient passes a good deal of blood in his urine. Those who never drink unboiled water will never suffer from this disease. It is probable that the young worm sometimes enters the skin while persons are bathing. (3) Ascaris lumbricoides, the common round worm, is very prevalent throughout the country. The treatment is a dose of santonin. (4) Tapeworm also is prevalent. The usual form is the Taenia ediinococcus of the dog ; and its cystic form, the hydatic cyst, is by no means rare. Prevention ; boil all water, and never eat uncooked vegetables—lettuce, celery, &amp;c.—as the ova, passed by the dog, are not killed by the sun, and quickly mature if they get into water or into the stomach. (5) ' Hook-worm' disease, due to Ankylostoma duodenalis, has probably been intro duced by pilgrims from Egypt and India. It would only thrive in damp ground near wells and bathing-places. Kat Neuroses. A diseased condition peculiar to S. and SW. Arabia (Yemen, &amp;c.), among those who chew ' Kat' leaves habi tually and in excess. The signs are ; loss of memory, irritability, general weakness, and constipation. These symptoms may also appear when the ' Kat '-chewer is suddenly deprived of the stimu lant. If the condition is not too far advanced it is curable. ' Kat' is the product of Catha {Kat) edulis.CHAPTER VI VOCABULARIES AND PHRASESVOCABULARIES AND PHRASES Pronunciation Consonants.
