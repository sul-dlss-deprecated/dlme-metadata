He is a son of Haji Abdulla Khan bv his second wife, a daughter of Haji Mirza Akber ivnan, the first Qawam-ul-Mulk. The Nasir-ul-Mulk a internal cousin, the Haji Khanoum Zeenat- i, u i t nrd daughter of the famous Haji Nazir-ul- JViulk, who was Governor of Bushire in 1856. By his marriage tlie Aasir-ul-Mulk has only one child, a107 daughter, who died in infancy. His wife the Haji Khanoum Zeenat-ul-Mulk, died at the end of January, 1918. Although related through his mother and by his marriage, to the Qawam family, the Nasir-ul-Mulk was for several years antagonistic to the Qawams, and inclined to join the Nuri family against them. During the life-time of his father-in-law, above mentioned, Abul Qasim Khan (as he was then called) obtained no appointment of importance, but lived on the proceeds of some small patrimonial estates, and what his wife allowed liim out of the proceeds of her large estates. After the death of his father-in-law, and after rueceed- in&lt;r to the title, the Nasir-ul-Mulk became Vizer of Fars, but owing to trouble with Muhammed Reza Khan Qawam-ul-Mulk, chiefly of his own making, he had to leave Shiraz in 1898 and went to Tehran. There he obtained the guardianship of the Shrine of Imam Reza at Meshed, and was away from Fars for some years. On his return to Shiraz, he at different times again became Vizer of Fars, and was on more than one occasion appointed Deputy Governor General, when the Governors General were being changed. On one occasion when acting as Deputy Governor _ General, he assisted Ajit Singh and two other Indian sedi- tionists to escape, although he had been asked by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, to arrest them. In 1911 when the late Habibullah Khan Qawam- ul-Mulk and hi® brother, the late Nasr-ed-Dowleh, were arrested bv the present Nizam-i-Sultaneh, the Governor General of Fars, the Nasir-ul-Mulk in co operation with. Baha-i-Sultan and the Sou a -ec Dowleh, assisted Nizam-i-Sultaneh against the brothers using the late Atte-ed-Dowleh as a cat s paw m intrigues. In the subsequent fight which occurred between the Nizam-i-Sultaneh and the Qawam fanny,/ 108 the Ata-ed-Dowleh’s ancestral house in the city was plundered, and afterwards ruined by tire. On the dismissal of the Nizam-i-Sultaneh, the Nasir-ul-Mulk fled to Kerbah), in fact was deported from Ears, and i emained at Kerballa till 1914, when he again returned to Shiraz and again commenced his intrigues. When the Gendarmie officers rebelled in 1915, the Nasir-ul-Mulk was shown a bogus telegram, said to .have been received from Tehran appointing him Deputy Governor General. There are many who say that the Deputy Governorship was forced on' the Nasir- ul-Mulk, but there is little doubt that he was willing to accept it, and even if he was at first deceived as to the authority of the Gendarmie officers, which is doubt ful, he knew they were acting against the British and against the Qawam-ul-Mulk. A cabinet was appointed to assist the Nasir-ul-Mulk, one member of which was tue late Saad-us-Sultan, then Karguzar of Ears. ovever, the Nasir-ul-Mulk had very little power to do mischief, as the Government was really in the hands r; favar-Haider Kuli Khan and afterwards in the hands of. Ins brother Yavar Ali Quli Khan. On one occasion the latter reprimanded the Nasir-ul-Mulk for takmg bribes.

A timid man, though by no means a fool, he looks after his own interests and carefully watches which way the cat is going to jump, consequently he became considerably involved with the Germans when they turned the; * British out of Kerman. He is now however strongly pro-British, at all events outwardly. He had been Deputy Governor for some years but owing to a quarrel with the Prince Governor General, Nusrat-us- Sultaneh, with whom he had always been on bad terms, he was deprived of the Deputy Governor ship in November, 1917 and also command of the Kerman Army.

Succeeded as Deputy Governor of Kerman by Sardar-i-Mutazid. SARD All NAZAR KHAN (GumsJiadsais ).—Appointed head of the Gumshadzais November, 1916. Genea logical tree given rsetow.136 1904, and seized 1 all the above properties and those of the family. Dissensions at once arose between him and his elder half-brother (by a peasant mother) Ahmad Khan, Zaigham-ud-Douleh (afterwards Sardar Ihti- sham q.v.) : fighting broke out in 1906, when Zaigham- ud-Douleh was temporarily Ilkhani, the Qashqai splitting into two factions, and a small battle was fought at Kudian, K W. of Shiraz. Soulat-ud- Douleh was again Ilkhani 1907. In 1909 May, he professed to be a ‘ Constitutionalist ’ and invaded Shiraz with a body of Qashqais against Muhammad Ali Shah. In 1910, on the state of the Bushire-Shiraz road becoming lawless, he contracted with the merchants of Shiraz to safeguard passage of caravans via I 1 iruz- abad for 1,000 Tumans monthly. At end of that year proceeded to Bushire to meet Nizam-us-Sultaneh, G-overnor-General, with whom he made a close alliance. With Nizam-us-Sultaneh he plotted the attack on Qawam-ul-Mulk IV, and his quarter of Shiraz, in the summer of 1911, and had Qawam’s brother, Nasr-ud- Douleh, murdered by Qashqais at Khaneh Zinian on their expulsion from Pars. After rallying of Kham- seh tribes to Qawami family, and flight and deposi tion of Nizam-us-Sultaneh, he lost the Ilbhani-ship which was held by Zaigham-ud-Douleh till October 1912, when Soulat-ud-Douleh was re-appointed by Muknbir-ns- Sultaneh, GrOYernor-GeneraL His men attacked Swedish Gendarmerie at Kara-agach river in 1913, wnen Major Siefvert was ivounded. On outbreak of Avar shOAA’ed considei'able sympathy with Germans, Avith Avhom he remained in correspondence. The Indian, agitator Amba Parshad had been har boured by him for some time. In 1916 opposed appointment of Farman Farma as Governor-General, and combined with Qawam-ul-Mulk, both entering Shiraz. At first on correct terms with Colonel Gough and General Sykes, with the latter of w om he hact an arrangement for policing the upper part of the Kazarun road : but in 1918 on, a fracas a’mg^ pace between S. P. R. men and the Dareh- s-nm tribe, he summoned all his following, joined theKazaruni attack on the S. P. R. posts, and attempted to bieagner the Headquarters S. P. R. in Shiraz itself. He fought a detachment near Chanar Ralidar, cut otf the supplies of water, fired into the cantonment and European gardens. At the same time an attempt was made by his full-brother Soulat-us-Sultaneh to rush the S. P. R. troops in Abadeh. July 1918 Farman Farnia, Governor-General, nominated Sardar Ihtisbam, as Ilkhani, and the latter’s full brother, All Khan, as Ilbegi : the Qashqai tribesmen split into factions, Soulat-ud-Douleh retreated south, was pursued hy a column of Indian troops, and suffered a serious defeat near Firnzahad November 1918, when many Qashqai were killed and influenza completed his rout. Subsequently he remained for two years in retirement in Qir and Karzin, not daring to move with the migration. In 1919, when British influence was at its height, negotiations took place with Farman Farma for either the dispatch of Soulat-ud- Douleh to Tehran, or to Muhammareh,' or the pay ment of a guarantee. In the end £10,000 were deposited by him in the name of the Consulate at Shiraz with the Imperial Bank for 2 years on con dition that his eldest son • remained a hostage in Shiraz, that he did not interfere with Sardar I lit? sham’s rule of the tribe or property, or otherwise intrigue. In November 1920 the new Governor-General Musaddiq-us-Sultaiueh, a demagogue, on the counsels of Nasir-ul-Mulk arranged a meeting between Soulat-ud- Douleh, his half-brother, and Qawam-ul-Mulk in Shiraz, when the government of the tribe was handed over to Soulat-ud-Douleh’s eldest son as Ilkhani, and to Sardar Ihtisham’s second son as Ilbegi, to act jointly. Within a month Soulat-ud-Douleh had chased his nephew from the tribe, and since then has remained the real, though not nominal chief power in the tribe. 2,000 tents of the Darehshuri clan and the Kashkulis refused to submit to him. On the Sayyid Zia-ud-Din coup d’etat, and the appointment of Prince Nusrat- us-Sultaneh as Governor-General, both of wj^om were for his arrest, his position again became shaky. The138 Prince supported Qawam-ul-Mulk and Sardar Ihtisham, even paying a subsidy to the latter ? s brother, Ali Khan. Operations against him were contemplated by the S. P. R. in the spring of 1921, but were pro posed too late in the migration : he consented to pay 41,000 Tumans taxes, so great was his alarm. By the autumn, with the disbandment of the S. P. R. the position entirely changed. Widespread looting by Qashqai on the Isfahan road, and in southern Fart provoked a vehement and general demand for his supersession, especially from the Qawami landowners and Mullas, the chief sufferers. In September 1921 however he had dispatched an emissary with presents of money to Tehran, and contrived to win the support of the Cabinet particularly of the Minister of War : and Sardar Sipah opposed his removal from control of the tribe. He took umbrage at an agreement between the Kashkuli Khans and the A. P. 0. C. in October 1921, and did his best to stir up the central government to upset the agreement. In May 1922 he signed a separate agreement with Sir. A. Wilson, acting on behalf of the A. P. 0. C., by which he received a considerable annual subsidy. The object of particular favours by the Minister of War during the latter’s visit to the south, November 1922 : in July 1922 Sardar Sipah had insisted on another reconcilia tion between him and Qawam-ul-Mulk. Has 5 sons, Muhammad Nasir Khan the Ilkhani, born about 1902 : Malik Mansur Khan born about 1906 : Muhammad Husain Khan born about 1914, and a baby. In taxes for the Qashqais, due to pay 66,000 Tumans annually : for his private properties, which are very large (though mostly occupied without a legal title) and under-assessed 9,000 Tumans. Said to have great hoards of wealth, particularly near his castle of Pargan in Karzin. Character : very avaricious, revengeful and unforgiving. A dissembler, especially in his pose of an ardent Nationalist, but astute, e.g., in dealings, and in his retention of a number of powerful friends at Tehran,.
