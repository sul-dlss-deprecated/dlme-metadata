Thank you so much for what you say in paragraph 13 of your letter about my suggested Persian Gulf tour. Just before receiving your letter I had telegraphed to you to say that the Naval Commander-in-Chief, who has been most friendly and co-operative, had let me know that if the scheme was approved he would readily place at my disposal two Cruisers and two R.I.N. sloops; and I hope that you may be able to agree that I could safely authorise him to start to make provisional and confidential preparations,on the clear understanding that if the situation nearer the time should so develop as to make it unsuitable for me to be absent from India even for the inside of a fortnight, they would have to be cancelled. You need not fear that I shall endeavour to emulate George Curzon, even if I had the knowledge, or the strength of conviction, on the many problems of the Persian Gulf to enable me to do so! But my interest in that area is real; and what I should like to do, if possible, by this tour, would be to make some contribution to the strengthening of our hold over the several Rulers of the Arab shore in circumstances in which we may very much want their fealty. In 1900 we were of course, as you say, anxious to localise so far as possible the South African imbroglio. I wish that we■H © 2 . could feel that the trouble now overhanging our unhappy heads was likely of being localized as easily. I greatly hope therefore that it may be possible, with your approval, to carry through my intention. —s s ® t k-'I c/i-VV^ f-A. H iii ^.u.. Ut. (UM.I 7 ^ ^ hs)~&gt;A Sc* L.

The scale on which he is prepared to co-operate seems perhaps to indicate that he supposes that great political importance attaches to the visit.

Naval Goranander-ln-Chief, whom I had sounded as to possibility of naval vessel being available in the event of your finding it possible to approve proposed tour, telegraphs offering to place hi® flagship and EMUS# Liverpool at my disposal, and adds that 8#N#0., Persian Gulf with two esoort vessels could attend. He aska for an early | decision *as to whether cruise will take place. 2. 1 on replying expressing great appreciation of hie courtesy and explaining that I have not yet received your approval for tour, and that decision must clearly turn on whether the international situation and the internal situation in India nearer the time are such as to make it possible for me to be absent even for this brief period, and may clearly, should there be uncertainty regarding either, have to be adverse. I have added however that I would ask you whether you thou^it we could, in the interests of the Naval Commander- in-Chie^s general programme, go so far as to atari making provisional arrangements confidentia lly on the clear understand ing that they might have to be called off at v®ry short /. notice. If you can give me any assistance in that direction I shall be most grateful. Constitutional position as regards proposed tour is, I think, sufficiently clarified by letter , sent to Clauson on 6th August, and question now, as I see it, essentially turns on probable international and Indian position nearer the date proposedMi “I otherwise than on leave with a substitute acting for him. I have nothing to quarrel with in Sir H.Lewis's extremely cautious statement of the 'constitutional^ position.” But, if the decision were mine, I should still -v feel great hesitation as to the propriety of the Governor- ► General's absenting himself from his charge for a fortnight for a visit to the^Persian Gulf^^^If there were something concrete to be done in the Gulf which no-one other than the Governor-General himself could appropriately do, the matter might be different. If this view were to prevail, and possible complications arising out of an international crisis were not regarded as the sole or the main objection, then there would appear to be no point in allowing the naval authorities to start on preparations which, if they go at all far, will presumably involve a good deal of trouble. ^ —mmmm + m (3) ^zmca. •riDc&amp;«&gt;cwtto ftmxGk. lgG&amp;&amp;X~~*9G$ Extract from private letter from Lord Linlithgow to Lord Zetland, dated 2nd August, 1939. 22. I have now had a reply from Lewis to the reference I had made to him as to the possible constitutional aspects of my proposed visit to the Persian Gulf; and I am sending you by this bag the relevant extract from his letter, which approaches the question on the assumption that the visit to be made to the Gulf would in fact constitute an absence from India. I think myself that his argument is convincing so far as these particular difficulties go. I realise, hov/ever, that it does not dispose of the more v/eighty argument as to the difficulty of making arrangements too far in advance, given the fact that in the last resort everything, subject to your general approval, must turn on whether the international situation and the internal situation in India permit of my absence, even for a few days. I think the best thing for me will be, if you agree, to go ahead quietly with preliminary preparations and to avoid making things firm until say my return to Delhi at the end of October. By then, though there will still be an element of uncertainty, one ought to be able to hazard a fairly accurate guess; and obviously the arrangements for the naval escort and the like will have to be put in train, even on a provisional basis, even earlier, and provisional/tu j, *jv Z*' ~ 5^ provisional arrangements start to be considered by the Persian Gulf authorities. I anticipate no difficulty so far as the local Rulers are concerned and all the indications are that the visit would be exceedingly welcome. I have, of course, myself met, and entertained, the Sultan of Muscat at Delhi. The Sheikh of Bahrein (for some reason best known to him) has just arrived in Simla in the middle of the rains for a change of air, and I hope to make his acquaintance on my return there on 14th August; v/hile I can think of no reason why there should be any difficulty with His Highness of Kov/eit, or on the Trucial Coast, should there be any question of one’s putting in there.■MB to 9^ 5 cXjp. U-o. u-ju O (,1^) f r secret &amp; personal , , Extract from/D.0,No.S.1132/39-H dated 31st July, 1939, from Sir Hawthorne Lewis to J.G.Laithwaite, Esqr, • ••••• 3. As stated by the Secretary of State there is nothing in the Act which in terms requires the Governor- General^ presence within his charge; and the Secretary of State appears to assume (in his telegram) that there is no bar to the exercise by the Governor-General of his functions during his absence. In fact as the Secretary of State points out absence of the Governor-General in Nepal, an independent though neighbouring State, has not been felt for the period of his absence to interfere with the discharge by the Governor-General of his functions. If that is correct of absence in Nepal, on constitutional grounds it is equally correct of the rather less adjacent Persian Gulf. 4. The only provision which I can find that is in any way directly relevant is the provision in paragraph VI of the Governor-General*s Instrument of Instructions under Federation which is drawn in the following terms VI. And whereas great prejudice may happen tcTOur Service and to the security of Inaia oy the absence of Our Governor-General, he shall not quit India during his term of Of -l ice without having iirst obtained leave from Us under Our Sign Manual or through One of Our Principal Secretaries of State. This provision does not appear in His Excellency's Instrument of Instructions during the transitional period, but has been seen by Parliament when the provisional Instrument for the Federation was placed before it for information in 1935. 5. It will be noticed however that, as stated in the Secretary of State's telegram, it is proposed to ascertain His Majesty's pleasure before permission were given for a visit by the Governor-General to the Persian Gulf. 6...■BBHIHHi 6. The general position in the transitional period is that - (a) under section 42 in the ninth Schedule provision exists for the discharge of the business of the Governor General in Council during the absence of the Governor General; but there is no provision unaer which powers vested in the transitional period in the GovernorrGeneral (e.g. discretionary functions, prerogative of mercy, etc.) can be delegated. (b) provision for leave is regulated now by the Ninth Schedule; and will later be regulated by paragraph 4 of the Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor-General. But - (c) neither (a) or (b) requires to be read as prohibiting short visits outside Indian limits (as strictly construed), ,(d) provided His Majesty f s pleasure is taken. 7. Gn the constitutional aspects therefore the view taken by the Secretary of State seems correct - (1) that a visit to the Persian Gulf would be a visit outside India, and (2) that during the period of that visit the Governor- General would not be incapacitated on any constitutional ground from discharging functions vested in himself as distinct from the Governor- General in Council.Extract from private letter from/Lord Linlithgow to Lord Zetland-, dated 4th/7th August, 1939. 13. I note what you say in paras.17 and 25 as to your desire to visit the Persian Gulf. I quite realise that the possible objections to your absence from India raised in my telegram to you on the subject may not be of much weight and you may count on me not to be obstructive. I shall probably have to obtain the approval of the Prime Minister when the time is reached for taking a decision. You mention George Curzon*s tour. I wonder if among the papers v/hich you have about it you have a letter from the Secretary of State to the Viceroy written on May the 22nd, 1901, in v/hich George Hamilton conveyed to George Curzon the alarm which his proposal to visit the Persian Gulf had created in the minds of the Government at home! ' looking to the condition of affairs abroad just now', the letter ran, 'both the Prime Minister and Lansdowne think a visit by you to that part of the world would be inopportune and risky ... We all feel that until we can emerge from the South African imbroglio we must keep quiet. Your views as regards the Persian Gulf are well known, and if in the autumn you were to pay your proposed visit, undoubtedly it would cause a great deal of excitement'! Looking back the 'South African imbroglio' appears a small thing when contrasted with the sort of imbroglio which atpresent hangs threateningly over Europe and the Par East. On the other hand you have not behind you the Persian history that attached to George Curzon. In any case he had his way two years later, and if we get through the next two months without the storm breaking I do not see why you should not carry out your intention. Prom the local of view I should think that a visit by you would have an admirable effect upon the Trucial Chiefs.W . h'Jbd . y \‘0 H&gt; fUjktl&amp;M &lt;j0 &lt;*i IccL EXTRACT from private letter from Lord uiniithbow to7/ ? ^, Lord Zetland, dated d6th July 1939. V- 17. I had meant to have mentioned in ray last letter ray ^ suggestion that I might visit the Persian Gulf, but I forgot to do so. I hope very much that you will feei able to agree to it. I have taken a gooa deal of interest in -he politics of that part of the world since I assumed on ice, and lam lully seized ol its very great importance from our point of view; more particularly at the present .ime. I think it would be no bad thing politically were a Viceroy, for the first time for 24 years, to pay a short visit to the Gulf, and I think that I could do so, so long as the international situation remains clear, without uncue inc )nvenience. Ivly idea would be, with such support as the Naval Commander-in-Chief can give me, to go straight from Karachi to Koweit, spending a day or so at Kov.eit, Bahrein, Luscat and possibly at ohavjah or some where else on the irucial Coast, and getting back to Bombay about the 8th or 9th December. I have not the least doubt, having read the papers still preserved here about Curz on * s tour and even about Hardinge's tour in less g.reeeble conclit?$ns id' 1916, that it would be a profoundly interesting experience, ano having eariiei* in my terra visitea the astern ana the Southern limits oi xnaianwaters at Victoria Point and Cape Comorin, 1 should like to visit the Western extremity at Koweit before the time comes for me to hand over. * * * * * * 25. Thank you so much for your telegram a bout my Persian -ulf visit, which I have juot haa. I quite agree that in taking a final decision, weight vill have to be given to a I variety of factors and that it will probably be difficult to decide very far ahead; and that has always been present to me. I am not seriously troubled on the constitutional side: but I will consult Lewis further about this. So far as return in an emergency is concerned, my impression is that I should never be more than 24 hours, or at the outsiae 36, fi .nn India - in other vords that it would probably be easier for me to get back to Delhi from the Gulf than from certain I th 0 out of the way provinces without air facilities. That also I will check, ^s regards telegraphic communication, I should, of course, have the ship's wireless at my constant disposal throughout the trip. How astonished some of my xliustriouo pieuecessorci would be, with their ponderous peregrinations, oy the suggestion that the Governor-General mighu t,ndangei the seem iuy 01 hio charge by being out of touch with his capital for more than 24 hours! I do not anticipate any difficulty with the Gulf Rulers; but of course,if the voyage were to materialise, I should take sounuings of the Political resident on that point before any definite decision was arrived at. I am most grateful to you for your ^ielp, ana for your readiness, if the situation permits and if we can get over these other difficulties, to approach the Palace, as I mentioned in an earlier paragraph in this letter, dictated before I received your present telegram,, I am very anxious ii possible to make this journey, ana I hope very much that circumstances may aamit of my doing so.Department. / / / S' immediately to India in case of need . / ' / / i —■ The latter point, which hardly arose m the case of your visit to Nepal, ' / * ' * does seem to be one of some practical importance in the case of sn absence ✓ / in the Persian Gulf/ I should be glad of your further views on this point.

In the latter case, although it is true that for so long as he was in Nepal territory the Governor-General was absent from his jurisdiction, yet he was apparently located at a place only a very few miles over the border and could if need be presumably have got back to Indian soil again in a car in a matter of minutes. In other words, the absence on that occasion was almost of a technical character. This, however, is a very different proposition, and the arguments used in support of it would seem to me ; under modern conditions of transport and telephony,almost to be usable with very little stretching in support of the proposition that the Governor-General could without impropriety take a spell in the south of France without being regarded as absent from his charge and consequently necessitating the appointment of an acting Governor- General. However, as I noted on the previous occasion, there is nothing in the Act which in terms requires the Governor-General^ presence within his charge. The2 . question, therefore, on every occasion is probably one of degree, and this particular proposal seems to me to come very near, if it does not overstep, permissible limits. I doubt whether the fact that the Governor- General in Council exercises foreign jurisdiction as the agent of the Crown in Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf can be called in aid in mitigation. fi)./ V ulL 10 )jJHr U A fir*) ^ {L** ^Cy. 1 &lt;-. 4 i ^ 4*-v ^ A **” t, »^‘ /&lt;*rC ^JLi/SUm t v xJk I*-**' t* ulU A\*+*t ^*f£*4-Vt A »**+ ; W&lt; fr-M ft: ■£. /ii f.ituM^' , r ‘jnj. , ! • fin flktuixftifrsi , A/Lfit /■*' Wy^Jutud _ xxx tohSurliii./ fit* UftUJ ui )&gt;*xJj^~ (k ‘Y* Ocal/ud' ^ ^ Pm'Jf WrtJ 6k l/I'ewrfj V//'/ ^.ta^ ^4*, • •►&lt;■ ^ Tele gram from 7 Viceroy dated 17th July, 1939.

I have been considering arrangements for the early part of my winter tour and I am very much inclined, if the international situation should then permit and if you and the Foreign Office see no objection to pay a visit to the Persian Gulf. I have always been closely interested in it, and I think it might be no bad thing for the Viceroy to pay a brief visit to the Arab SHEIKHDOMS at this juncture. There could, of course, be no question of my landing in Iraq or on Persian coast, and I would contemplate no more than a visit by sea, touching at Muscat, possibly at Sharja, at Bahrain and Koweit and then returning. Metcalfe, with whom I have discussed the idea, thinks that there would be advantage in it. I would leave Karachi about November 24th, returning to India about December 8th. I am taking confidential soundings of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies as to possibility of a cruiser being available. 2 . I shall greatly welcome your views. The final decision will, of course, have to depend on how the International/International situation is shaping. But I should be able to maintain sufficiently close contact with India and, if a situation developed of such a nature as to require my presence at Headquarters, I could always, by falling back on the air, be in Delhi again in a day or so.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001eb_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3921</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001eb</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3921</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/183 'Proposed visit to Persian Gulf by H.E. the Viceroy.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-01-31T22:04:19</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (27 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 29; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns a proposal by the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, that he make an official visit to the Arab shaikhdoms of the Persian Gulf: Muscat, Sharjah, Bahrain, and Kuwait are mentioned as likely destinations. Linlithgow requested permission for the visit from the Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland, because he felt it was important for Britain to strengthen her hold over the Arab rulers there. However, he acknowledged that the visit was dependent on the international situation [the impending outbreak of the Second World War].The file includes correspondence from Linlithgow and Zetland, and India Office minutes. The papers show that British officials had various opinions on the wisdom of the visit, which is discussed on constitutional grounds, and in terms of speed of travel, communications, and the international situation.
