While, of course, no one can guarantee that financial assistance will enable Persian Government to re-establish normal conditions, at any rate the chance of success makes it worth a trial, and this chance depends, in my opinion, more on promptitude with which assistance is rendered than on the magnitude of the sum given. Mere fact that the two Governments were assisting the Persian Government in this crisis would go far to strengthen their authority in the provinces. I do not deny that Persian Government have need of a substantial loan for the extinction of the debt, or that customs revenue if affected only for foreign debt would bear considerable further borrowing, but apart from His Majesty’s Government’s unwillingness to face this at this juncture, the delay necessarily involved by the negotiations for a large loan puts it out of court for the moment.

As I saw that he was impressed by this, I suggested both Governments making a joint advance of 200,000/. at once, and a similar sum a month later. He repeated that he did not know wdiere additional funds were to come from. I observed that he and the Minister of Finance would have a month to think over that point, and no doubt some banking arrangement could be made. I will send him a private letter on which he can base a further appeal to his financial colleague. I had given him a memorandum on Sir G. Barclay’s telegram No. 1, and he to-day remarked that he did not see the connection between a money advance and the possibility of having to abandon policy of non-intervention. I explained to him the close connection between the two questions. He replied that he did not believe that a Persian force could be of any use in re-establishing order. I said that it would be but fair to give them a trial, and if they failed we could not reproach ourselves with not having given them the means of making the effort. that Ephrem had been compelled to fall back on Serab.

R. /St. Petersburgh, January 6, 1910, 4*25 p.m. PERSIAN advance. ^ I have received memorandum from Russian Government in regard to above subject. ^ They do not refuse in principle to participate in an advance, though they are convinced that an advance of even 400,000b will not lead to an effective improve ment of the situation, and will be speedily exhausted. They consider that an advance should be made in close connection with a more considerable loan, as the latter can alone provide necessary funds for the introduction of urgent reforms and for extinction or conversion of floating debts, which are so burdensome to the Persian Treasury. In accordance with the views of M. Naus and of M. Bizot, the Russian Government believe that the Persian Government, once freed from floating debts, could contract a loan of 3,000,000b, for which surplus customs revenues would be sufficient to guarantee interest. They do not propose to place any portion of the loan on Russian market, but they consider necessary funds could be found in France if Russia and England guaranteed regular payment of revenues affected to the service of the loan. Memorandum draws attention to article 5 of Anglo-Russian convention, and intimates that Russia and England could promise to apply in case of necessity the measures of control therein stipulated in favour of the banks who undertook loan. As negotiations for a loan would take a long time, it is clearly necessary to take question in hand without delay. Furthermore, Russian Government draws attention to the fact that it will onty be by means of negotiating a large loan that Russia and England will be in a position to insist on the institution of an effective financial control, and to ensure satisfactory solution of certain questions, such as preferential rights as regards railway concessions. As to an advance on loan, Russian Government point out that last spring they placed in Russian bank their share of advance projected. That sum, namely, 100,000Z., is still available, and the Russian Government would be ready to advance it; but it would be very difficult for them to go beyond that sum, as they would in that case have to obtain legislative sanction. A control of expenditure of advance is indispensable, and they think control should be confided to a special financial commission, on the lines laid down in Russian memorandum of 26th March, 1909 (o.s.j.

THE Russian Ambassador called at this Office on the 18th instant on his return from leave of absence, and was received by Sir Charles Hardinge. Speaking of Persia, his Excellency said that the Russian Minister of Finance was of opinion that it would be necessary, in order to achieve any real result in that country, to lend at once a large sum to the Persian Government, and for His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments to make a serious demand for the control of its expenditure. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs was under the impression that this view was shared by His Majesty’s Government. Sir C. Hardinge told Count Benckendorff that M. Isvolsky was entirely mistaken, and that there could be no question at present of a larger loan than the joint advance which had been agreed on. It had yet to be seen what sort of control could be imposed and whether it could be effectual, and no money could be raised in this country for Persia till some order had been re-established in her finances and administration. Sir C. Hardinge begged his Excellency to correct the false impression under which M. Isvolsky laboured, since His Majesty’s Government could be no party to a loan larger than the advance already agreed on. I am, &amp;c. E. GRhY t ONFIDENTIAL.

Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 20.) (No. 660.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, December 14, 190J). SIR G. BARCLAY was good enough to send me a copy of his despatch No. 213 of the 30th ultimo relative to an advance to the Persian Government. I called on M. Isvolsky this afternoon, and said that I gathered from Sir G. Barclay that it was of high importance to furnish the Persian Government with sufficient means to enable them to take measures for the purpose of re-establishing order, and generally to set the administrative machine going. It was clear that the Persian Government could not continue for long to lead a hand-to-mouth existence, with every probability of a recrudescence of disorders and disturbances, and a situation of anarchy might arise which would compel intervention, possibly on a considerable scale. This was an eventuality which both the British and Russian Governments would doubtless do all in their power to avoid, and it seemed to me therefore essential that all possible means should be adopted to prevent such a contingency. An advance of some kind, therefore, would appear imperative, even if securities and guarantees were not of a very substantial character. Such an advance would be in reality true economy. M. Isvolsky replied that the Russian Government were not at this moment disposed to be particularly amiable to the present regime. The Persian Government seemed, of set purpose, to be pursuing a policy of “ pin-pricks ” towards the Russian Government. The attitude of the Persian charge d’affaires here was almost insupportable, and he was continually coming to the Ministry with a series of petty complaints of an unjustifiable nature. The Russians had undoubtedly by the dispatch of their troops to Ardebil saved that town from the Shahsevans and had restored it to the Persian Government. For - this service the latter had not expressed a word of thanks, but had formulated annoying and groundless complaints against the Russian consul at that place. Again they were complaining because the Russian Government had declined to accord the exequatur to a perfectly impossible man whom they had selected as Persian consul-general at Odessa. He could cite me other instances of the irritating policy which the Persian Government w T ere pursuing, and of the indifference which they evinced towards securing the good-will of Russia. He himself did not see in what respect the new regime was any improvement over the old. I observed to M. Isvolsky that, in my opinion, it was extremely foolish of the Persian Government not to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards Russia, but that I had not suggested any favours to Persia. I had in my mind the interests of our two countries, which were directly involved if anarchy were to ensue in Persia. It was in the interests of us both that some order should be evolved in Persia, and it was painfully evident that the Government of that country, in their present penniless condition, were quite unable to take any practical measures to that end. M. Isvolsky replied that he feared that he would have the greatest difficulty in persuading M. Kokovtsoff to risk placing any more Russian money in Persia. M. Kokovtsoff had no parti pris against this or that Persian Government; he was solely concerned with the care of not pledging the Russian Treasury to advances which might be lost for ever. Russian finances were undoubtedly improving, but M. Kokovtsoff was exceedingly parsimonious, and kept a very tight hand over the purse-strings. He understood that the Persian Government wished for an advance of about 500,000L, of which the Russian share would be 250,0001. M. Kokovtsoff would have difficulty, after the large sums already lent to Persia, to persuade the Duma that such an advance was justified. I suggested to Mi Isvolsky that he should lay before M. Kokovtsoff the considerations which I had submitted, and explain that if matters grew so bad as to inevitably lead up to intervention, the latter would be infinitely more costly to the Russian Treasury than the present advance. We then discussed other matters, but towards the end of my interview M. Isvolsky said he would like to return to the Persian question, and he asked me from what funds and m what manner would my Government make the advance. I told him that I could not reply off-hand, and I was unable to tell him seance tenante whether the Govern ment would find the money or the Imperial Bank of Persia. He said that he did not wish to put it forward as a formal proposition, but, in view of the objections of [2533 u —oj2 M. Kokovtsoff to untie his purse-strings, could I suggest some means by which a joint advance could be made without necessarily burdening the Russian Treasury at this moment ? I said I did not quite understand. He replied that he had a dim recollection of our having on a previous occasion suggested some “ transaction ” which would har &gt; facilitated an advance from the Russian Government, and perhaps some proposal could now be made which would place him in a better position for overcoming the scruples and opposition of M. Kokovtsoff. I confess I was puzzled with the vague hints of M. Isvolsky, and I did not know whether he had in mind some arrangement which would permit of Great Britain making the whole advance, on the understanding that Russia would later reimburse her share. I will look up the previous papers before the messenger leaves and see if I can ascertain if some such arrangement had been previously mooted. I have also a recollection of something of that nature having been put forward, but my memory may be at fault. I did not like to put the question point blank to M. Isvolsky, as I might have misunderstood him, and, in that case, I thought that I might offend him. I said that I would communicate with you and let him have a repty later. I have, &amp;c. A.

IN my despatch No. 201 of the 30th ultimo I reported that it was generally believed that when the Medjliss met a determined attack would be made on the Ministry by the advanced Nationalists. That this opinion has not proved correct is due to the counsels of moderation of Nasr-ul-Mulk, who since his return has used all is powerful influence to persuade the advanced Nationalists not to upset the present Labme . He tells me that on his arrival he was urged to accept the post of Regent, but that le had refused in the conviction that he could do more useful work for the moment it he held no office and confined himself to giving disinterested advice. ^ He has uigec on the advanced Nationalists the services rendered to the constitutional cause by Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, Prime Minister and Minister of the interior, the two members of the Cabinet against whom complaints were especially directed, and has T 08 , strongly deprecated any attack on them at this moment. His counsels have prevailed so far. The two Ministers had, on the meeting of the Medjliss, tendered their resigna tion The Regent refused to accept it, and his action has now received the express approval of the Assembly. Azad-ul-Mulk has also been confirmed in his post as Regen , so that the provisional administration has received what is tantamount to a vote of confidence. No progress has been made in the negotiations between the two banks and the Glovernment for the joint advance of 400,000 tomans against the Crown jewels, no reply having yet been returned by the Persian Government to the proposals of the two banks. . . , It would not be perhaps entirely a matter for regret if these negotiations came to nothing, for doles of this kind merely enable the Government to continue a hand-to- mouth existence. Now that the Medjliss has met, the sooner it pockets its pride and authorises the Government to apply to the two legations for a substantial advance le better it will be in Persia’s interest. Indeed, it is, I think, very unfortunate that the Persian Government should during the past four months have shirked the responsi bility of taking this step by themselves. Much precious time has been wasted. I he negotiations which must ensue before an advance can be made must occupy a considerable time, and the position to-day would be more hopeful it these negotiations were we ll advanced. Fortunately for the new Government there has been relative tranquillity in the country since shortly after the revolution, but there are not wanting signs that this will prove to have been merely a temporary lull. The mam southern route—the Bushire-Ispahan road—is again reported practically closed the section between Shiraz and Kazerun, on which the Russian consul-general at bushire was recentlv attacked, and the stages immediately south of Ispahan, where the road is completely blocked by the Kuhgeluis, being especially disturbed. Disturbances are again threatening at Shiraz, where the governor-general, able man though he is, is finding great difficulty in maintaining his authority with the small force at his ^ 1S P 0 ®^ • His Maiesty’s acting consul regards the situation in Ears as critical, and urges that the governor should receive strong support from Tehran, adding that, should Saham-ed- Dowleh fail, the province would fall into chaos from which the only exit would be intervention. Tribal conflicts, for which the Kalhurs appear to he responsible are reported from the neighbourhood of Kermanshah. From Kerman news comes that tie Narmashir district is threatened with raids from Baluchis. At ^enjan, where trou e has been brewing for some time, fomented by a reactionary mullah, there has oeen fighting between the mullah’s following and the Government Hoops who were on their way to Ardebil. Fortunately the latter were entirely successful, the mullah and is leading supporters being captured, but notwithstanding this success and despite the deliverance of Ardebil by the arrival of Russian troops the general 1 ’ think, decidedly less hopeful than four weeks ago. Unfortunately the Lab *1 I Oprogramme for submission to the Medjliss, which is believed to contain a proposal to apply to the two Governments for a loan, has not yet been placed before the Assembly. Every day which passes without some really substantial financial assistance to the Government is likely to bring us nearer to a state of things where the intervention of the two Powers on a large scale may be ine's itaole. ^ ^ The most crying needs for the present are the institution of an efficient gendaijjf mene and the reorganisation of the financial admimstiation. Both are essential before the revenue can again be properly collected and can be properly used, and it is probable that neither will be practicable without a liberal introduction of the foreign element. The two Governments will no doubt wish to make this condition a sine qua non of Anglo-Bussian financial assistance, though, having regard to the probable consequences of a continuance of Persia’s present hand-to-mouth administration, I am not sure that, in the event of such a demand proving an insuperable obstacle to an advance, the two Governments would not find it better economy in the end to waive jt, giving the Persian Government money and letting them do the best they can with it themselves. They would probably fail to effect any permanent improvement in the administration, but there would be an offchance of success which it might be worth taking sooner than leave the Government without funds. Nasr-ul-Mulk seems to realise that the co-operation of Europeans is needed, but 1 have no certainty as to the feeling of the Medjliss, which has not yet shown its hand. Probably it would be willing to invite French assistance for the financial administration, but the gendarmerie is the great difficulty. The Bussian Government has made it known that it is opposed to the employ ment of foreign officers of any nationality not approved by it, and I gather from my Bussian colleague that, except for the districts where we have special interests, his Government is not inclined to allow the employment of any military officers but Bussians. This would be a pill which I fear the Persian Government might find impossible to swallow, and it was because of this, and in order to give Bussia less handle for demanding the employment of her officers in the north, that in our scheme for the protection of the main southern route Major Cox and I recommended the employment of British civilians rather than military officers. It is more than possible that the Persian Government could be brought to employ foreign officers in any gendarmerie force that may be instituted, but if Bussia insists on these being Bussians, and this is made one of the conditions of an advance, I should have little hope of the Persian Government’s accepting Anglo-Bussian financial help. It would, I think, prefer, if it can get help from no other quarter, to attempt to carry on in the present hand-to-mouth fashion, which can only lead sooner or later to a state of things admitting of no solution but intervention on a large scale.

The negotiations which must ensue before an advance can be made must occupy a considerable time, and the position to-day would be more hopeful it these negotiations were well advanced. Fortunately for the new Government there has been relative tranquillity in the country since shortly after the revolution, but there are not wanting signs that this will prove to have been merely a temporary lull. The main southern route—-the Bushire-Ispahan road—is_ again reported practically closed, the section p e t W een Shiraz and Kazerun, on which the Russian consul-general at Bushire was recently attacked, and the stages immediately south of Ispahan, where the road is completely blocked by the Kuhgeluis, being especially disturbed. Disturbances are again threatening at Shiraz, where the governor-general, able man though he is, is finding great difficulty in maintaining his authority with the small force at his disposal. His Maiesty’s acting consul regards the situation in Ears as critical, and urges that the governor should receive strong support from Tehran, adding that, should Saham-ed- Dowleh fail, the province would fall into chaos from which the only exit would be intervention’. Tribal conflicts, for which the Kalhurs appear to be responsible, are reported from the neighbourhood of Kermanshah. From Kerman news comes that the Narmashir district is threatened with raids from Baluchis. At Zenjan, where trouble has been brewing for some time, fomented by a reactionary mullah, there has been fighting between the mullah’s following and the Government troops who were on their way to Ardebil. Fortunately the latter were entirely successful, the mullah and his leading supporters being captured, but notwithstanding this success, and despite the deliverance of Ardebil by the arrival of Russian troops the general sitation is, 1 think, decidedly less hopeful than four weeks ago. Unfortunately the Cabinet s [2533 w— a]programme for submission to the Medjliss, which is believed to contain a proposal to apply to the two Governments for a loan, has not yet been placed before the Assembly. Every day which passes without some really substantial financial assistance to the Government is likely to bring us nearer to^ a state of things where the^ intervention of the two Powers on a large scale may be inevitable . ^ r ppg m0 st crying needs for the present are the institution of an efficient gendar merie and the reorganisation of the financial admimstiation. Both are essential before the revenue can again be properly collected and can be properly used, and it is probable that neither will be practicable without a liberal introduction of the foreign element. The two Governments will no doubt wish to make this condition a sine qud non of Anglo-Russian financial assistance, though, having regard to the probable consequences of a continuance of Persia’s present hand-to-mouth administration, I am not sure that, in the event of such a demand proving an insuperable obstacle to an advance, the two Governments would not find it better economy in the end to waive it, giving the Persian Government money and letting them do the best they can with it themselves. They would probably fail to effect any permanent improvement in the administration, but there would be an offchance of success which it might be worth taking _ sooner than leave the Government without funds. Nasr-ul-Mulk seems to realise that the co-operation of Europeans is needed, but I have no certainty as to the^ feeling of the Medjliss, which has not yet shown its hand. Probably it would be willing to invite French assistance for the financial administration, but the gendarmerie is the great difficulty. The Russian Government has made it known that it is opposed to the employ ment of foreign officers of any nationality not approved by it, and I gather from my Russian colleague that, except for the districts where we have special interests, his Government is not inclined to allow the employment of any military officers but Russians. This would be a pill which I fear the Persian Government might find impossible to swallow, and it was because of this, and in order to give Russia less handle for demanding the employment of her officers in the north, that in our scheme for the protection of the main southern route Major Cox and I recommended the employment of British civilians rather than military officers. It is more than possible that the Persian Government could be brought to employ foreign officers in any gendarmerie force that may be instituted, but if Russia insists on these being Russians, and this is made one of the conditions of an advance, I should have little hope of the Persian Government’s accepting Anglo-Russian financial help. It would, I think, prefer, if it can get help from no other quarter, to attempt to carry on in the present hand-to-mouth fashion, which can only lead sooner or later to a state of things admitting of no solution but intervention on a large scale.

If we insist on employment of Englishmen, even [? as] civilians in south, it will be difficult to urge Russia to refrain from making employment of Russian military instructors in the north a condition of her share in the advance. Such a condition would probably wreck advance, and it may therefore prove desirable to waive our demand for Englishmen and to leave selection of foreign instructors in south to the Persian Government, subject, of course, to our approval.

I have received a letter [? from Minister for Foreign Affairs], of which following is substance. I will send copy by post to-night. He considers that an advance of 500,000b will not bring about a radical improve ment in a situation which is chronic, and which requires more efficacious remedies. Any modest advance made to Persian Government would only postpone their decision in regard to conclusion of the ioan which is inevitable. He doubts if Russian Government would consent to make any advance to Persian Government unless the latter consented to ask assistance of Russians and of Englishmen for the realisation of a more or less considerable loan. According to data in his possession, he is of opinion that present condition of Persian finances would allow' of the conclusion of a loan of about 3,000,000b with assistance of Russians and of Englishmen, on condition that a portion of loan should be at once affected to consolidation of or extinction of floating debts, which amount to about 1,000,000?. The support of Russia could only be granted on sure and real guarantees, and on condition that a commission of financial control be instituted. It w T ould also be necessary to obtain from Persian Government a satisfactory settlement of certain questions which are of interest to Russia and England, such as question of railways, &amp;c.

I remarked that it was as much in the interests of Russia and England as in those of Persia that means should be supplied for establishing order in the country. In fact I was thinking more of our joint interests than those of the Persian Government themselves. He then fell back on the opposition of the Minister of Finance to granting any further loans or advances to Persia. Russian finances were no doubt improving, but Minister of Finance held the purse-strings very tight, and he doubted whether he could prevail on him to loosen them. He asked where and how we would find the money for a joint advance. Would the Government advance it or would the Imperial Bank of Persia. I replied that I did not know. (Confidential.) He subsequently asked whether we could suggest some transaction whereby he could baulk opposition of the Minister of Finance and obviate immediate necessity of Russia making her share of advance herself. He was very vague as to what he had in his mind. I asked if he were thinking of a joint syndicate, or what ? But he gave me no clue. He said that perhaps I might enquire if some arrangement could not be come to between the two Governments which would facilitate matters. He has not given me much to go upon, but he said he had a dim recollection that on a previous occasion wm had made some suggestions. I will look up previous papers on subject.

We promised to telegraph this application to our Governments. Without discussing conditions, we both endeavoured to elicit views of Persian Government as to security for advance, employment of money, control of expenditure, and the engagement of foreign agents, but we found Ministers as yet unable to state their views with more precision and in greater detail than as follows :— Persian Government offer at present no security. They hope for a considerable loan later for consolidation at low interest of the floating debt, 'which would reduce charges on custom-house, thus enabling them to provide for necessary security. Ministers stated that money was to be used for restoration of order, for which formation of an army and gendarmerie was needed, and for reforms, especially financial. They said they were preparing and would communicate to the two legations a detailed programme of expenditure, and also scheme of control, of which we could gather no clear idea except that M. Bizot was to be given more influence than heretofore, and was to superintend its execution. If foreign advisers were found necessary they would be engaged, the Medjliss having approved their employment in principle, but as regards finances they wished for the present to try how far changes in Persian staff and the employment of enlightened persons would suffice to effect necessary reforms. This is not very encouraging, but I trust two Governments will not refuse to discuss an advance.

Programme also foreshadows a larger loan for later on in order to consolidate advances now carrying exorbitant interest. At the risk of appearing to address you prematurely, 1 venture following observations:— My despatch No. 200 will have shown that the customs revenue as at present charged will not bear further borrowing, but I hope that this—in view of (.1) Persian Government’s urgent need; (2) possibility of substantially reducing the charges on the customs by a consolidation of the two banks’ advances ; (3) likelihood, if things go right, of considerably increased customs revenue ; and (4) certainty, if things go wrong, of our finding means in Persia to recoup ourselves will not in itself detei two Governments from making a joint advance. If necessary, passport and telegraphic revenues could be made supplementary security. _ # . I would tentatively suggest followdng conditions, subject to modification and development as the negotiations proceed : — (1) Budget of the expenditure of money lent to be approved by the two Powers and its execution supervised by a committee, of which Bizot and Mornaid shall^ be members. Approval only to be given if it provides (2) for the institution of an efficient gendarmerie with a number of European instructors, (3) for the reorganisation of the financial administration, with the help of five or six 1 rench employes, and (4) eai- marking in general terms of railways (see my despatch No. 206). Medjliss has not yet shown its hand, but I do not know that any of these conditions should prove very difficult of acceptance, except No. (2). . .. Russian Government may not be disposed to admit, except in districts ot mteiest to us, any but Russian officers, and I believe that, sooner than accept this, Persian Government w r ould, if it cannot find assistance elsewhere, prefer to carry on m the present hand-to-mouth fashion, which must sooner or later lead to a state of things where intervention on a large scale will be inevitable. . . In any case I trust that conditions upon which w r e shall eventually insist will not be such as to wreck advance. Without a substantial advance there is not hope of assuring the stability of the present regime, and it might well prove better economy m the end to His Majesty’s Government that financial assistance should be given to Persian Government, even without conditions, than not given at all. If lent y instalments purse strings could always be drawn if it were being spent to no puipose. I shall not discuss matter with Russian Minister until Persian Govemment applies, or at least until I learn how far you concur in conditions suggested. Sir A. Nieolson informed.

I HAVE the honour to transmit a statement furnished me by the Administrator- General of the Customs showing what he describes as the fixed charges on the customs revenue for last year. It will be noticed that these amounted to 2,639,500 tomans, or within 400,000 tomans of the highest level reached by the customs nett revenue, viz., 3,011,038 tomans in 1907-8. The Persian Government have recently undertaken liabilities in respect of the ex-Shah’s pension—100,000 tomans a-year—and his debt of 2.400.000 tomans to the Russian Bank, and they have promised to take over His Majesty’s debts to Russian subjects amounting to some 400,000 tomans. The debt to the bank is secured on the northern customs, and the Russian Government will doubtless insist on Mohammed Ali’s pension and his debts to Russian subjects being similarly secured. This must involve a further charge of some 300,000 tomans a-year. Besides this there are other additional charges which the customs will have to bear. M. Mornard’s figure for interest due to the Imperial Bank of Persia does not, I believe, take into account certain debts of the Shah and of N aib-es-Saltaneh to the Imperial Bank which were taken over by the Persian Government last winter. These, with recent arrears of interest on the advances of the two banks and on our Government loan, and with a claim of the Imperial Bank of Persia of 150,000 tomans against the late Mint-master which will have to be taken over by the Persian Government, will involve a further additional annual charge of certainly not less than 100,000 tomans. If M. Mornard, therefore, were estimating to-day on the same basis as he has adopted in the enclosed list the annual charge which the customs revenue will hence forward be called upon to bear, he could not, I venture to think, count it at less than 3.100.000 tomans, or 100,000 tomans more than the highest level ever reached by the customs revenue, and 400,000 tomans more than last year’s net receipts— 2.700.000 tomans. It is quite evident that on the basis of M. Mornard’s statement no further borrowing is possible on the security of the customs, and although only the first four items are fixed charges by virtue of engagements undertaken by the Persian Govern ment, the remaining eleven items being merely chargeable to the customs in accordance with usage, it would be difficult to relieve the customs of any of these latter. The Russian Government would doubtless object to any other security for the payment of the Cossack brigade, and it is important that the salaries of the European Government officers should be well secured. The rest of the eleven items mostly appertain to the Customs administration. It is thus evident that a condition precedent for any further borrowing must be the conversion of the advances, &amp;c., of the two banks, and even this would, as I calculate it, only leave sufficient margin for a very trifling loan unless it were found possible to relieve the customs revenue of some of those heads of expenditure with which it has hitherto been charged in accordance with usage. The advances of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Russian Bank carry for the most part interest at the rate of 12 per cent, and over. The debt to the two banks amounts, as I understand it, to between 8,500,000 and 9,000,000 tomans, of which I would hazard an estimate that 7,000,000 tomans carry interest at the rate of 12 or 15 per cent. The conversion of this debt and the reduction of the interest to 5 per cent, would effect a saving of probably 500,000 tomans, in which case, supposing that the customs receipts do not fall below last year’s level and for the first six months of this year they show an increase, there would be a margin for -borrowing of 100.000 tomans.

It is &amp;ow nearly four months since the Represent atives of His Britannic Majesty and of His Imperial Majesty the Czar last advised Your Majesty jointly to fulfil the pledges so repeatedly given to Your people and to the two Representatives to reestablish constitution al Government in Persia. Unfortunately for Y.M. and for your unhappy country, unfortunately too for the interests of Great Britain and Russia, Y.M. has persisted in violating these pledges, and in following t he advice of evil counsellors rather than the wise counsels of the two neighbouring and friendly Powers with the result that the situation has gohe from bad to worse and that it is now difficult to point to any part of the country, except the capital, where the Central Government has any authority. Not only are the principal towns in revolt against the present reactionary system, but the general condition of anarachy has spread so as to be will nigh irreparable- a state of things not only disastrous for Y.M. and your subjects but also fraught with great injury to the Nationals of the two neighbour ing Powers. Had Y.M. followed the friendly advice of the two neighbouring Powers four months ago, the state of Persia would have been very different from the deplorable condition of affairs existing to-day which has become a byfyword amongst the civilised nations of the world. Had Y.M. fulfilled your pledges four months ago a reconciliation between Y.M. and YJTs people would have ensued immediately and there is no reason to doubt that in a short space of time the united efforts of Y.M. and of a Constitutional Govt, would have brought about a notable improvement in the general condition of the country.

As soon as the measures enumerated in para graphs 1 to 5 have been taken by the Shah, the Russian Government may, if it thinks necessary, make an advance to the Persian- Government for the urgent expenses necessitated by the introduction of reforms, of £100,000. The Pritish Government vxlll, if it considers it necessary, make a similar advance to the Persian Government as soon as the elected Assembly has adopted this advance. If it is after wards found necessary to facilitate a larger loan to Persia this could only be effected under certain guarantees which will form the object of a subsequent exchange of views betioeen the two Governments and the Persian Government. Animated by the sincere desire to assist Persia in the crisis of extreme gravity through which she is now passing, the Cabinets of London and St.Petersburg hove agreed on this programme of friendly advice to be given to the Shah, and the two Gove i *nmnts believe that the execution of the programme in question is the only means for Persia of escaping from her present almost inextricable situation.1,1* o CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Sir A. Nicolson (St. Petersburgh). (No. 675.) Foreign Office, May 14, 1909, 6 p.m. RUSSIAN Ambassador has told me for my information of advance ■which Russian Government think necessary to enable the Persian Government to carry on now that the Shah has accepted conditions as to Constitution. I have told him that we cannot advance any part of our share of 400,000Z. loan till an Assembly sanctions it, but that if Russia considers it necessary I cannot object to her making some advance. I have pointed out, however, that Russia mlist carefully guard against risk, that Shah, when money is lent, may again upset the Constitution and reject advice. In that case Russia would have to make a very firm stand and the Shah had better follow Abdul Hamid into retirement. Otherwise it would appear that Russian money had been used to defeat a Constitution, and feeling here would be so strong as to make further co-operation impossible. / [4*2—406].i Sir A.

Russian Government do not wisli to place their share of advance to joint account of two Legations, though they are willing to keep British Legation informed and to consult with it as to mode of disbursment. I said that we were willing when the time came for our share of advance to be made that it should go to a joint account, and that we were anxious to show Persian Government that we were acting in complete unison. I hoped that Russian advance, therefore, would go to an account. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Minister of Finance did not consider Russian money could be placed to a joint account. The above was what passed verbally between us to-day. He then gave me a Memorandum which made no mention of a joint account, but which is as follows :— (R.) “ The Russian Government have always considered it necessary that the mode of disbursment of advance to be made by two Governments should be controlled. Russian Government had therefore proposed in its Memorandum of 28th March the institution of a special Commission of Control. In view of satisfactory turn which the work of reform is taking in Persia, Russian Government consider it of urgency that the said Commission should be established. At the same time, whilst awaiting the conclusion of the discussions with British Government as regards Commission, and taking into consideration the wishes expressed in the British Memorandum of 21st April, Russian Government consider it opportune that half of first proposed advance, i.e., 50,000k, should be furnished by England. “ In the event of British Government not feeling disposed to make the advance simultaneously with advance of the other half by Russia, Russian Legation will have to occupy itself with the manner in which Russian advance should be employed. Russian Charge d’Affaires will receive instructions to keep British Legation fully informed of all measures which he will take in the matter.” (End of R.) British Memorandum of 21st April proposed that the Russian advance should be paid to a joint account. I asked who would compose Control Commission. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that Directors of the two banks and Financial Adviser would form Commission. I said that I very much doubted whether His Majesty’s Government would make an advance of 50,000k now, and I felt pretty sure that they would continue to await sanction of Assembly to any advance. He said Russian Charge d’Affaires proposed that 100,000 tomans should be allotted to payment of arrears to the Tehran troops, 100,000 tomans to Ain-ed-Dowleh’s troops, who would then be disbanded, and 50,000 tomans to the Foreign Affairs Ministry. This would make 50,000k, he said. If we gave another 50,000k it could go to other ecpially urgent needs, and to assistance in execution of Electoral Law. Russian Government evidently do not intend to give 100,000k as originally mentioned, but to limit their first advance to 50,000k (Sent to Tehran.) [452- 383]CONFIDENTIAL. 8 person Sir G.

He understands that His Majesty’s Government object to making any advance until it is approved by the Assembly, but if they share in the mockery [?] of keeping the account of first advance and in its disbursement they practically share in responsibility of making it.

We cannot definitely pledge ourselves to give a large loan to Persia at this stage. The misunderstanding seems to have arisen on my telegram No. 328 [of 17th March]. My words were that “ our advance would follow when the Assembly had accepted the whole loan,” meaning the whole loan of 400,000Z., not a subsequent loan. If proved necessary, we might facilitate a further loan by foreign capitalists, hut that is a matter for discussion and arrangement between the two Governments. Please suggest to M. Isvolsky :— 1. The substitution in paragraph (3 of inclosure in your No. 232 of the words “ aussitot que TAssemblee elective aura adopte cet emprunt ” instead of “ le projet d’un emprunt exterieur plus ou moins considerable ”; 2. The omission of the following sentence beginning “ En presence ” and ending emprunt, and the insertion after the words “ aussitot que I’Assemblee aura adopte cet emprunt,” of the following sentence :— “ If it is afterwards found necessary to facilitate a larger loan to Persia, this could only be effected under certain guarantees which will form the object of a subsequent exchange of views between the two Governments and the Persian Government.” Explain to M.

I will telegraph as soon as I receive his written reply. I may mention that M. Isvolsky gave me as his private view that he doubted if the Russian Government would make any advance of money to the Persian Government, and if they did grant one they would limit it to as small a sum as possible and dole it out as late as possible. I asked His Excellency whether the Council had come to any decision as to taking any measure to protect the Resht-Tehran road. He replied that no definite decision had been taken, and that the question was still being examined bv the competent Ministries. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) iE NICOLSON. In closure in No. 1. Aide-me'moire communicated to M. Isvolsky. HIS Majesty’s Embassy had the honour to receive the aide-memoire, dated the 4th (17th) March, of the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs relative to the procedure to be adopted by the Governments of Russia and Great Britain in regard to Persian affairs. His Majesty’s Embassy is now able to state that as regards point 1, His Majesty’s Government are still desirous that Amir Bahadur Jang should be removed from all his offices both in the Cabinet and at the Palace. In the event of the Shah pressing- very hard that that functional should be retained at the Palace, His Majesty’s Government would not, however, raise further objection to conceding that point. His Majesty’s Government will not insist on the removal of Sheikh Fazl-ullah from Tehran. With respect to points 3 and 4, His Majesty’s Government are not disposed to undertake the responsibility of designating the members of the Cabinet or of the Council, and they consider that it would have been preferable to make the grant of a loan conditional on a change of Ministers for others who inspired confidence. But, in order to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Imperial Russian Government, His Majesty’s Government would be ready to agree that the two Legations should submit privately to the Shah a list of suitable candidates both for the Cabinet and for the Council; it being clearly understood that if unsuitable candidates are selected by the Shah no money will be accorded. As to point 5, His Majesty’s Government have no objection to make to the revision of that point as proposed by the Imperial Russian Government. [2227 n—ll]2 As to point 7, His Majesty’s Government leave it to the Imperial Russian Government to act in regard to their share of the advance under the conditions mentioned in the aide-memoire of the 4th (17th) March as they may consider advisable. His Majesty’s Government would be unable to make their share of the advance until the Assembly had accepted the whole loan. His Majesty’s Embassy earnestly trust that, in view of the concessions which His Majesty’s Government have made towards meeting the views of the Imperial Russian Government, the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs will accept the proposals made in this aide-memoire.

The only criticism which I have to make is as regards the Financial Commission^ This proposal, if carried out, would practically mean that, the two Governments make themselves responsible for the Government of Persia, and if accepted it might not be prudent to appoint managers of banks established in Persia for the purpose of making money. Cannot the decision on this point be postponed so as to allow of fuller discussion between the two Governments and consultation with our Representative at Tehran and with the Financial Adviser there as to composition and functions of the Commission ? Urge M. Isvolsky to defer a decision on this point and to send instructions to Tehran to concert for joint representation in regard to the rest of the proposals.

Memorandum states programme as follows :— (R.) 1. The two Governments demand of the Shah the resignation of the Grand Vizier as well as of Ameer Behadur Jang ; the last to he removed from all his offices in the Cabinet and at the Palace. If the Shah presses very hard to retain him at the Palace, this point may be conceded. 2. Governments will obtain from Shah [? group omitted—promise to] re-establish constitutional regime after the introduction of the following reforms. 3. The composition of a Cabinet composed of persons worthy of confidence, and the addition without delay to the Council of Empire of enlightened persons belonging to different parties. The Council to elaborate and promulgate a new Electoral Law. The Legations will privately submit to the Shah a list of candidates for the Cabinet and the Council. If the Shah chooses people not inspiring the necessary confidence, no money advance will be made to Persia. 4. Two Governments will obtain from the Shah a general amnesty with the limitations previously announced. 5. Two Governments will demand that a date for the elections and for the convocation of the Assembly be immediately announced. These dates to be made known to the whole country without delay. 6. Russian Government may, if they think it necessary, advance to the Persian Government 100,000L as soon as preparatory measures enumerated in paragraphs 1 to 5 have been taken by the Shah. British Government will, if they consider it necessary, make a similar advance to the Persian Government when the elected Assembly will have accepted a foreign loan [?] more or less considerable. Assistance of the two Governments for a foreign loan will only be granted on condition that a special Commission composed of Directors of British and Russian Banks and of Persian Delegates is constituted. Commission would control expenditure, would supervise elaboration of the annual departmental budgets as well as their application in conformity with the Budget which will be drawn up by the Minister of Einance with the aid of the Commission, and will assist the Minister of Finance in revising and regularizing the law on Maliat. Russian Government consider that, if the Shah does not accept this programme in all its details, the two Governments should desist from giving the Shah advice and leave him to his own resources, and he can no longer count upon any support from them. In submitting the programme to the Shah the two Representatives should make a categorical declaration to the above effect. Russian Government would like to hear, as soon as possible, whether His Majesty’s Government agree with the above programme so as to send the necessary instructions by telegraph. (End of R.) I am not quite clear if you are in accord as to the special Commission and its functions, and whether they would not in some measure clash with the duties of the Financial Adviser and Treasurer.

If necessary Financial Adviser could at once draft instructions for Treasurer-General, A trifling advance would suffice for the reorganizatinn of the financial administration. This money could be placed at disposal of Tro; suror-Gonoral as soon as the Assembly has approved advance • Thoro is little hope of reform in the Gendarmerie &amp;ce Russian Govt: (?)without foreign instructors. It is to be hoped that will lose no tizno in appointing these so as to warrant a further advance from the two Govts: • Eventually in order to put finances on a sound footing a loan of at least 0,500,000 pounds will bo needed for conversion of the advances of the two Banks, for the settlomen of claims of the holders of Havals ( orders for payment) after these have been examined by a commission with a^European member, and possibly for the settlement of foreign claims filed by foreign Legations hero.

I said that I realised the difficulty, but I was afraid Russian intervention might bo construed as in tervention on behalf of the Shah, unoer present circum stances. I feared that the Bhuh was still anxious to provoke Russian intervention, believing that it.would be favourable to him.

I heard that F'onslour Isvolaky was hesitating about subsidiary poir*ts, such us the conditions on which money should be lent, one whether we should dictate to the Shah who his ministers should be. ' eonwhile, all representations were in suspense. I had suggested a way of meeting both these points. If Russia thought it both safe and essential, she might lend her Two hundred thousand Pounds. When tin Assembly had mot ana consented to the f * 100,000 whold ioui of Four hunurud thouounc Poumle, could(icmi/09) tOO,000 len d the other* Tv#o hundred thousand Pounds, our share. h I did not recormerid this course, hut it was a possihle one, if Monsieur Isvolsky thonrrht sono ininedlat© 1 oan essential. With regard to the Shah^ Ministers, I was averse to our designating them, as that would nrJce us responsible for the Shah’s Government. But we might attain our oblect by making it a condition of the loan that he should change his Ministers for others who rould inspire confit once, and by telling him that until he did so we aoulci not give him any money.

Russian Government think that it would be more prudent not to ask for the removal of the Sheikh from Tehran. Point 3. Russian Government still consider that it would be risky to leave to the Shah exclusively choice of Members of the Cabinet. They think that it would be extremely desirable, without expressly recommending to Shah Members of his future Cabinet, to influence His Majesty in his choice as far as can be done without encroaching on his supreme power and his free judgment. It might therefore be stated : “the constitution of a Cabinet composed of persons who will be suggested to him by the Legations of Great Britain and Russia.” Point 4. Russian Government think that composition of Council is as important as that of the Cabinet. They maintain their view that the members should be recom mended to the Shah in the form of friendly advice, and that there should be no express condition that the recommendations are only given at the Shah s request. ^ ^ Point 5. Amnesty to include only those who have taken up arms against Shah and who have committed political crimes, and not to extend to those who have committed offences against common law. As regards these and those who have committed acts of brigandage, guarantees to be obtained from Persian Government that they should have an impartial trial Point 7. Russian Government will make their share of advance when the Shah has carried out measures indicated in Points 1 to 6. Point 8. Russian Government drop it. I will send copy of Memorandum by post.

I said that I feared that the Shah was still anxious for Russian intervention, and tnat it Avould be regarded as being on his behalf. If only the Russian Government would impress upon the Shah that he has nothing to gain from intervention, and that it might probably result in his dethronement, on account of his incapacity to govern, I felt convinced that he would proclaim a Constitution at once. This would produce an immediate detente throughout Persia. In the meanwhile all representations at Tehran were in suspense. I had already suggested that Russia could make her advance of 200,000Z. if M. Isvolsky considered it essential and safe, and that our advance would follow when the Assembly had accepted the whole loan. It was not, however, a course which I would recommend. I was averse to designating the Shah’s Ministers owing to the responsibility this would entail, but the loan might be made conditional on a change of Ministers for others who would inspire confidence. The Shah would then select his Ministers and we could decide whether the condition had been fulfilled.III ■ 0 )iw CONFIDENTIAL Sir A.

Ostrogradsky on the present financial situation in Persia, as expressed in recent conversations which you had with those gentlemen. I approve your language to M. Bizot. With reference to the last paragraph of your despatch, I am of opinion that the consideration of loans or conversion schemes must wait until the financial adminis tration has been reformed under a constitutional Government.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey,—{Received February 15.) (No. 7.) Sir, Tehran, January 20, 1909. M. BIZOT tells me tliat the Persian Government are now showing a real desire to help him in his investigations into the financial situation. They at last realize that whatever other conditions may be attached to the financial assistance of the two Powers, it is a sine qud non that the real situation should be made clear to M. Bizot. They have now told off two capable officials of the Ministry of Finance to assist him, and they meet three times a-week for their work. It was until recently M. Bizot’s aim to secure the preparation of a general Budget, but the further he has gone in his investigations the more convinced he has become that it would be useless to attempt to put a Budget in force with the present machinery of the Finance Department, which suffers from the radical defect of an entire lack of centralization. What M. Bizot says is needed is that the local Treasurers, who are now at the mercy of the provincial Governors, should be completely withdrawn from their authority and placed solely under the orders of the Minister of Finance. This can only be done by the introduction of a non-Persian element in the administration, and M. Bizot thinks the best course would be to appoint two Europeans as Treasurer-General and Inspector of Finances respectively. No Persian could have enough authority to give the local Treasurers the backing required to enable them to withstand illicit demands from the Governors. With authority thus centralized in competent hands, and with a properly salaried staff—it is worthy of remark that in none of the statements given to M. Bizot, purporting to show items of expenditure, is there any reference to the payment of salaries of officials, except those in the Diplomatic and Consular services, and these are notoriously in arrear—there would be every reason to hope that a Budget could be put in force. M. Bizot tells me that he is now turning his attention to the question of the cost of the financial administration if thus reformed. In any case it would need but a small portion of the 400,000£. which it has been proposed that the two Governments should advanc 0 During the visit at which M. Bizot gave me the above information he asked me if there had been any change in the views of the two Governments as regards the financial assistance to be rendered to the Persian Government, as he knew that M. Ostrogrr.dsky, the Russian Financial Agent, was in favour of a very far-reaching scheme involving the conversion and unification of the various categories of debt. I told M.^ Bizot that, so far as I knew, there had been no change in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and that they were still only disposed to consider a joint advance of 400,000/. when adequate guarantees for the proper expenditure of the money were forthcoming. This could only be when a constitutional regime was in working order. Since this conversation with M. Bizot I have seen M. Ostrogradsky, and inquired as to his views. He told me that he had a day or two ago recommended to the Russian Minister of Finance the conversion and unification of the debt as the best way of putting the Persian Government on its legs financially. He did not know whether such a course was feasible from the political standpoint of the two Povers, ut it vas his duty to report to his Ministry what was best in Persia’s interests, even thougn 101 political or other reasons his recommendations should prove impracticable. e estimated the total indebtedness of Persia at something like 6,000,000/., and thought that a loan of 8,000,000/., for the service of which the Customs receipts would suthce, might be floated (I presume with the joint guarantee of England and Kussia), so as to leave, after the conversion of the present debt, a substantial balance which cou ( e used as required. . n „ , r M. Ostrogradsky was in full agreement with M. Bizot as to the need oi _cen ra i zation of the financial administration in the hands of a competent European. ’ however, be some time, even with the reformed system, before equilibrium eou e established, and the balance of the loan might be used to make good the annua ce ci s until this object could be attaineck Persia had suffered in the past 19 111 . na ^ Cia i assistance being given in driblets ; the time had come to leave her something m am for the future. [2151 p —7J u. r ... . — ' n -VJ ~ 1 2 It is impossible to say with any approach to accuracy what is the present annual deficit. According to figures, which both M. Bizot and M. Ostrogradsky think reliable, the revenue at the disposal of the Central Government, after meeting local expenditure, should, if the taxes were paid, amount for this year to some 5,612,000 tomans (1,100,000k). No reliable statement has been furnished of the expenditure (it would probably be impossible to produce one), but M. Ostrogradsky thinks that it exceeds the revenue by not less than 500,000k I presume that a’ conversion scheme like that recommended by M. Ostrogradsky will hardly commend itself to the two Governments ; indeed, I myself do not see that, even considering only Persia’s interests,'^^is required, inasmuch as the greater part of the debt does not carry an excessive rate of interest, and there is at least a probability that if the finances were properly administered, the revenue would suffice for the needs of Government. The conversion of the floating debt, which bears interest at 12 per cent, or over, is another matter ; and it is to be hoped that as time goes on the two Governments will see their way to facilitating it. The conversion of that part of the floating debt represented by the advances of the two banks into a 5 or 6 per cent, stock, part secured on the northern and part on the southern customs, would alone effect a saving of at least 70,000/. a-year. T n vp (Signed) ’ G. BARCLAY.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Eduard Grey to Sir A. Nicolson (St. Petersburgh). (No. 247.) R. Foreign Office, February 25, 1909, 5’45 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 87. We have carefully considered the personal proposals which M. Isvolsky has submitted as a basis for agreement between the two Governments, and we are ready to accept them, subject to the following modifications :— 1. Amir Jang, after dismissal, should not be allowed to hold any post at the Palace. His baneful influence would always be felt. It would also be desirable to advise removal of Sheikh Fazullah from Tehran. 2. Can be accepted. 3. This would imply intervention, and would entail an undesirable responsibility. 4. We can accept this proposal, provided that the recommendation is only given at the Shah’s request. 5 and 6. Can be accepted. 7. We are unable to accept this proposal in its present form, but we are ready to do so if the sentence “ as soon as preparatory measures enumerated above have ^ been carried out by that Government” is omitted, and if after the words “later date” the following sentence is inserted : “as soon as the Shah has constituted a constitutional Government, the personnel of which inspires confidence, and an elected Assembly has approved of the transaction.” This would indirectly meet M. Isvolsky’s view as set out in proposal No. 3. Money will no doubt be wanted for reforms in the police, finances, &amp;c., but these can be taken in hand with more advantage when the Assembly is working. If money were advanced now it would not be utilized for reforms, and the only proper purpose for which it might be used would be the payment of arrears to the troops. This would probably encourage the Shah in his reactionary tendencies. 8. As the Shah has already consented to the appointment of a Treasurer-General it would be better to avoid mention of it, since it might be regarded as due to foreign pressure. You will notice that in these suggested amendments to M. Isvolsky’s proposals we have done our utmost to meet his views, moie especially in proposal No. 7, and we earnestly hope that they may obtain his approval, and firmly consolidate the joint action of the two Powers in Persia.

He hopes that they may form basis for an Agreement between the two Governments :— 1. To require immediate dismissal by the Shah of the Sadr Azam and of Amir Bahadur Jang. Latter might at the same time retain office as chief of his personal guard. ^9 ofotam from the Shah re-establishment of the constitutional regime by means of immediate reforms enumerated below. 3. The constitution of a Cabinet composed of persons to be recommended to him by Russian and British Legations. .4. Inclusion in Council of Empire without delay of enlightened persons belonging to different parties, of whom some could be recommended to him by two Legations. This Council would be intrusted with elaboration and promulgation of a new Electoral law. 5. General amnesty for all those who have taken up arms against Shah. 6. Date to be fixed at once for the Parliamentary elections and for convocation of the Assembly. These dates to be made known without delay to the entire country. /. In view of fact that the complete lack of money in the Persian Treasury forms an insurmountable obstacle to realization of reforms recommended to the Shah by the two Governments, there shall be paid over to the Persian Government, as soon as pre paratory measures enumerated above have been carried out by that Government, a certain sum by way of advance on a loan to be made at a later date. Method of ex penditure of this sum will be controlled by Mixed Commission mentioned in Russian Memorandum of the 16th January last. Thus the two Governments may be perfectly sure that the money in question will be utilized for purpose of carrying out reforms which we consider urgent and indispensable for averting the danger of yet graver com plications, and not for restoration of Shah’s absolute power. 8. A French Treasurer-General wdth two assistants of the same nationality will assure regular receipt of taxes, and give to Persian Treasury a stable and normal organization.

NIOOLSON’S telegram No. 17 of 17th January and your telegram No. 70. s Following is summary of proposed reply to Russian Memorandum:— His Majesty’s Government consider best course would be to stand entirely aloof from internal affairs of Persia, allowing whatever is strongest to gain the day, even at risk of danger to British trade meanwhile; but they recognize that Russian losses would be considerably greater, and, if Russian Government cannot adopt this course, they are prepared to co-operate with Russian Government in regard to future action. They share view of Russian Government that situation is not likely to improve until representative government is established, and they therefore think efforts of two Governments should be dnected to inducing the Shah to fulfil his promises m this respect. Dealing with Russian proposals seriatim 1. They welcome suggestion as to advising Shah to call able and energetic men to his Council to assist in drawing up scheme of representative government, and submit that His Majesty should also be advised to dismiss reactionary advisers. 2. His Majesty’s Government entirely concur as to proposed advice, but would suggest that term should be fixed for fulfilment of pledge, and His Majesty warned that unless Constitution acceptable to his people be granted by fixed date two Govern ments will reconsider their attitude and take measures to safeguard their interests. 3. His Majesty’s Government consider question of loan had better await Adviser’s report. If that report shows foreign loan to be essential to re-establishment of Persian credit, conditions would have to be carefully studied, but His Majesty’s Government would deprecate large loan, and could not make any advance until elected Assembly had approved. They consider that question of control may stand over until constitutional govern ment is accomplished fact; but that Assembly should be given control over finances possibly by institution of a “ Cours des Comptes ” organized by a foreign expert. If’ however, Shah decides to appoint Treasurer-General at once, His Majesty’s Government will not object. 4. We deprecate making any advance at present./ CONFIDENTIAL, I ^ Su A.

I am sending copy by private hand on Tuesday, who will arrive on Thursday night. After an exposition of existing situation, Memorandum makes the following- proposals :— (R.) 1. Without in any way departing from principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of Persia, to recommend in a friendly way to the Shah that he should call to his counsels capable and energetic men, who have already given proof of their desire to extricate their country from the difficult situation in which it finds itself, specially mentioning Saad-ed-Dowleh and Nasr-ul-Mulk. 2. To express to the Shah the desire to see a representative Government established in Persia, necessity of which he has himself recognized, and without insisting on re-establishment of form in which that Government existed in 1907-8 ; to advise him to proceed without delay, with the assistance of those mentioned above and of other men of merit; to elaborate a Law instituting a new legislative body which will be in accordance with usages and historical customs of the Persian people as well as with its religious ideas, and wffiich will satisfy its needs and contribute to establish ment of peace and order in Persia. 3. If the Shah gives sufficient proofs of his decision to follow advice of Russia and Great Britain to assist him in concluding an external loan, more or less considerable, on the condition of the institution of a Special Commission composed of the Directors of the Russian and British banks, with Persian Delegates—this Commission to control expenditure and to see that the expenditure is devoted exclusively to the wants of the country ; to superintend various Budgets of the Administration ; and to assist Minister of I inance in the revision and regularization of the laws regarding maliat. 4. In order to give a proof of their amicable feelings the two Governments would be ready to put at disposal of Persian Government an advance of 200,000/., on the conditions arranged in 1906, in order to meet immediate expenses necessitated by introduction of reforms. (End of R.) He asked what I thought of the proposals. I said I did not notice any allusion to members being elected to the Council which should prepare the Electoral Law. I thought that there should be some elected members. He said he had avoided going into details, and mentioned “men of merit.” I added I thought question of an external loan should not be touched upon until M. Bizot had made a report. He said perhaps a loan would not be necessary at all. He had only sketched out possibility of one. I said I was quite sure we should not dream of an advance until an Electoral Law was prepared and date of election and of convocation of Assembly fixed. We might perhaps then consider question. He said he had carefully mentioned “ if the Shah gives sufficient proofs, Ac.” What proofs w r ere to be considered sufficient had best be left vague, and decided on by the Representatives on the spot. We could attach any conditions to the sufficiency of proof. He had no desire whatever to give Shah immediately an advance|; of course he must give|proofs of his good faith. I explained above were only my personal views on first reading the document. 1 should add Memorandum was discussed and approved by Cabinet.

He remarked quite good-humouredly that he did not see that His Majesty’s Government had advanced far to meet his views as regards point 7. He does not anticipate that joint action of two Governments will have beneficial results which His Majesty’s Government expect, but I feel almost sure that in order to maintain our [? entente] on the subject to which be attaches greatest importance, he wall be ready to act as proposed. He says that at Resht there are many Caucasian revolutionaries, that the man in real command is a certain Panoff, a mere [? ggfa)l-bird], and that bridge to Enzeli will be mined. He fears that w^e shall have great trouble ahead of us in Persia, and that Shah’s tenure will be made very insecure, and if he is upset there will be anarchy. However, I think that he will make the venture. We went [?] over some of the old arguments [?], but he still maintains his opinions. I suppose he will give me a written reply very shortly.

From what Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me to-day, he is still much perplexed and embarrassed as to what to do in regard to joint action in respect of Persia. I thought [?] he would have, against his better judgment, I admit, agreed to the steps which it was proposed to take, but he says that they would be without result unless some financial [group omitted : ? aid] were rendered, and that no competent men would take office in Persia unless they were supplied with some means to [?] set the machine going. I begged him to let the attempt be made, and 1 said that my Govern ment would not, I was sure, make an advance without the sanction of an Assembly. He says that then it will be too late. He has no intention of not maintaining our co-operation, but he is distressed that we did not give way on point 7. Those here who are hostile to our Agreement are making, he tells me, capital out of the present difficulty. Situation at Resht is so threatening and dangerous that he is sending fifty Cossacks for the protection of Consulate, and Russian Government are moving a few troops to Baku and to frontier at Julfa. He continually impresses on me that Russia is suffering far more from the present situation than is Great Britain, and he is much disappointed that His Majesty’s Government did not accept his eight points as they stood.

M. Isvolsky has always been strongly of opinion that while the two Governments should insist on the Shah fulfilling his promises to establish a constitutional regime in Persia, it was almost essential at the same time to furnish the Government of Persia with some financial assistance which would enable them to execute some of the most urgent reforms and to meet some of the most pressing needs. M. fsvolsky has always contended that when the Treasury is depleted and the salaries of the officials and troops many months in arrears, it is of little use for the Shah to decree a Constitution and a reorganization of the Administration. He was at the same time quite ready to admit that a supply of funds to the Shah at the present moment would be most inadvisable, and would doubtless be misconstrued and misapplied ; but he considers that, as soon as there is undoubted proof that the Shah has taken steps to carry out his engagements, it would be permissible and also advisable to furnish such pecuniary aid to the Persian Government, under proper guarantees as _ to its expenditure, as would permit them to pay some arrears and to start the machinery. I think then that the Russian Government would, be disappointed if they discovered in the British reply no indication of any willingness to supply a certain modest sum such as 200,0001 or 300,000k, when both Governments were assured that the Shah had in reality taken measures in the sense in which he has been advised. . I ventured therefore to suggest by telegraph that I might be authorized to add a sentence at the end of the British Memorandum which would hold out some hope of the two Governments being willing to examine the question of a moderate advance under the necessary guarantees, when they had satisfied themselves that the Shah had actually taken steps towards fulfilling his promises.

NICOLSON’S telegram No. 34 and yonr reply No. 95. ‘ M. Bizot thinks, and I concur, that the appointment of a Treasurer-General without executive powers will he useless. If the financial administration is to he improved it must be centralized in the hands of an official at the Ministry of Finance, the provincial Treasurers being placed solely under him and entirely withdrawn from the authority of the local Governors. It is hardly conceivable that any Persian, even with the support of a popular Assembly, should be capable of successfully combating the powerful influences on the side of the present lack of system, which so easily lends itself to malversation, and unless there is to be Anglo-Russian financial control, central authority in the hands of a capable European depending directly from the Minister of Finance in the same manner as M. Mornard already does for the Customs offers the best chance of effective reform. Not knowdng nature of the forthcoming Anglo-Russian demands, I have avoided talking with Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding Treasurer-General. I doubt if he has any clear idea of his functions, but think that he realizes that to be useful he must have executive powers. M. Bizot has sketched for me the following programme of his tvork :— 1. He must work to secure regular payment of the maliat and its regular disbursement for the expenditure with which it is now charged. 2. By degrees he must centralize in the Treasury all revenue receipts, including the customs, and combat irregular interference of the local Governors in fiscal matters. 3. In time he should be able to secure the elaboration and execution of a proper Budget, I am inclined to think that, if a Treasurer-General is to be appointed, it would be better that this should be settled under the present regime. When Parliament meets we may find them reluctant to allow appointment, and, if we then imposed it, it would make his relations more difficult with the Medjliss than if his appointment were already a fait accompli. The former Medjliss, chauvinistic though it was, retained Belgian Customs officials. Would not objections to the possible intrusion of French influence be sufficiently met by a “ lettre de service ” similar to M. Bizot’s ? (Sent to St. Petersburgh.)CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 31, 7 p.m.) (No. 73.) Tehran, January 31, 1909, 8'40 p.m. AMIN-ES-ZARB, a prominent Tehran merchant, who owes the Russian Bank 2,000,000 tomans and Imperial Bank of Persia 500,000 tomans, has been for some time in difficulties. Persian Government now offer to take over his liabilities to both banks on following terms :— Persian Government receive in cash from Russian Bank 150,000 tomans and from Imperial Bank of Persia 40,000 tomans “in order to pay Amin’s small creditors.” Persian Government take over from the banks the securities they hold, and undertake to repay Amin’s total liabilities in five years with interest at 7 per cent., charging 5 per cent, collecting commission. General Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia is telegraphing to London recom mending acceptance of this offer, and I understand that Russian Financial Agent has telegraphed to St. Petersburg!! in the same sense. Proposed arrangement is undoubtedly the best that could be done in the banks’ interest, as the debts are only secured in part, and the securities, being landed property, would be difficult to realize. But, however alluring for the two banks, arrangement would give Persian Government a lump sum of 190,000 tomans besides enabling it to make away with the debtor’s estate, for it is of course unlikely that proceedings would be used to repay banks, and Persian Government’s [? group omitted] would thus be increased by over 2,500,000 tomans.

Amount of loan to be 8,000,000L, which, after the conversion of the present Debt, which is between 6,000,000k and 7,000,000h, would leave a substantial balance to cover future deficits. Both M.

I am sending copy by private hand on Tuesday, who will arrive on Thursday night. After an exposition of existing situation, Memorandum makes the following- proposals :— (R.) 1. Without in any way departing from principle of non-intervention in internal affairs of Persia, to recommend in a friendly way to the Shah that he should call to his counsels capable and energetic men, who have already given proof of their desire to extricate their country from the difficult situation in which it finds itself, specially mentioning Saad-ed-Dowleh and Nasr-ul-Mulk. 2. To express to the Shah the desire to see a representative Government established in Persia, necessity of which he has himself recognized, and without insisting on re-establishment of form in which that Government existed in 1907-8 ; to advise him to proceed without delay, with the assistance of those mentioned above and of other men of merit; to elaborate a Law instituting a new legislative body which will be in accordance with usages and historical customs of the Persian people as well as with its religious ideas, and wffiich wiU satisfy its needs and contribute to establish ment of peace and order in Persia. 3. If the Shah gives sufficient proofs of his decision to follow advice of Russia and Great Britain to assist him in concluding an external loan, more or less considerable, on the condition of the institution of a Special Commission composed of the Directors of the Russian and British banks, with Persian Delegates—this Commission to control expenditure and to see that the expenditure is devoted exclusively to the wants of the country ; to superintend various Budgets of the Administration ; and to assist Minister of Finance in the revision and regularization of the laws regarding maliat. 4. In order to give a proof of their amicable feelings the two Governments would be ready to put at disposal of Persian Government an advance of 200,000/., on the conditions arranged in 1906, in order to meet immediate expenses necessitated by introduction of reforms. (End of R.) He asked what I thought of the proposals. I said I did not notice any allusion to members being elected to the Council which should prepare the Electoral Law. I thought that there should be some elected members. Fie said he had avoided going into details, and mentioned “ men of merit,” I added I thought question of an external loan should not be touched upon until M. Bizot had made a report. He said perhaps a loan would not be necessary at all. He had only sketched out possibility of one. I said I was quite sure we should not dream of an advance until an Electoral Law was prepared and date of election and of convocation of Assembly fixed. We might perhaps then consider question. He said he had carefully mentioned “ if the Shah gives sufficient proofs, &amp;c.” What proofs were to be considered sufficient had best be left vague, and decided on by the Representatives on the spot. We could attach any conditions to the sufficiency of proof. He had no desire whatever to give Shah immediately an advancef; of course he must give|proois of his good faith. I explained above were only my personal views on first reading the document. I should add Memorandum was discussed and approved by Cabinet.7- 3 l*- In any farther communica tion on this subject, please quote No. 44098/08. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

I said that it should be brought home seriously to him that this attitude could not be allowed to continue. Minister for Foreign Affairs asked what steps I had to propose. He had received no news as to the refusal of the Shah to receive the dragomans. He said that he did not like taking any action which would have the appearance of direct intervention in favour of one party or the other. I told him it would be sufficient if we took our stand on the fact that the Shah had undertaken to promulgate an electoral law and convoke an Assembly, and we had strongly urged an amnesty for the Tabreez people. We should persistently continue to press the Shah to carry out these engagements. I asked what kind of reception was to be accorded the Special Envoy who has just arrived. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had not yet ascertained whether he had any credentials or exactly in what capacity he came here. He believed that he had a letter from the Shah, but means could he found for having that transmitted to its destination. Persian Minister had not yet presented his credentials to the Emperor, and when he had done this he would talk to him as to the Special Envoy. I said that I hoped that the latter would in any case have a cold reception. Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he certainly would not have a cordial one, but he must first find out about him. As to the general question, he would talk over the matter with M. Hartwig, and said he would send the latter to see me. I said that I hoped he would, as I should like to have a talk with him.

BIZOT called on me on the 25th instant and said that he had been summoned to the Shah’s camp that morning and had been requested to find some means of raising a considerable sum of money, which was urgently required to pay and feed the troops at Tabreez. It was first pressed on him that he should try to obtain the advance of 400,000/. from Great Britain and Russia; but on his pointing out that the Persian Government had shown no intention whatever of fulfilling the conditions which the two Governments attach to the advance, and that therefore he could not recommend the proposal to the two Legations, the Prime Minister then inquired if M. Bizot could not assist the Government to raise money if he, Mushir-es-Sultaneh, pledged his jewels as security. M. Bizot said that he could not of course prevent the Minister from raising money in that manner, as a personal transaction, but that he must in every way discountenance any attempt of the Government to obtain funds indirectly by this means. I told M. Bizot that I entirely concurred in his view that it was impossible to encourage the Persian Government to hope for any financial advance from the two Governments in present circumstances, and 1 thought it unlikely that either the Imperial Bank of Persia or the Banque de Pr6ts would lend money to Mushir-es-Sultaneh on the security of the jewels, knowing that the loan would eventually be transferred, under a “dastkhatt” of the Shah, to Government account. 1 agreed also in his view that the only way to put an end to the ruinous and crazy efforts of the Government to obtain money was to make its acquisition as difficult as possible, while letting it be understood that the sole hope of obtaining pecuniary assistance from the two Governments or the banks lies in accepting a reasonable measure of reform. The only danger that I saw in this course was that, if the screw should be turned too tight, the Shah’s present reckless advisers might induce His Majesty to turn elsewhere, e.g., to Germany, and obtain accommodation on extortionate terms. The same afternoon M. Bizot consulted both the Russian Minister and the Russian Financial Agent, and, finding them both of the same opinion as himself, it was arranged, subject to my concurrence, that M. Bizot and M. Ostrogradsky should call on the Prime Minister the following day and tell his Excellency that so long as the existing regime in financial affairs continues the Government need not look for any assistance either from the Legations or the banks. The two gentlemen fulfilled their mission at Bagh-i-Shah on the following day. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. [1970 cc—20]Minute Paper. |1 Secret Department.

IN his telegram No. 135, repeated in your telegram No. 207 of the 17th ultimo. His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh has reported that while the Russian Government agree in principle to the proposal for a railway from Mohammerah to Julfa and are prepared to enter on a discussion of the practical details, they consider that the question is intimately connected with that of an important external loan which the financial difficulties of the Shah render necessary. There can of course be no question of the great benefits which must accrue to Persia from the construction of the lines contemplated even with the discriminating conditions which the Russian Government desire to impose in favour of Russian trade, but as regards the loan I am by no means convinced that any really considerable sum is required, and I venture to offer for your consideration some observations on this point and also, though with some diffidence, on the consequences which appear to me to be inevitable should such a loan be accorded. I take it of course for granted that His Majesty’s Government would in no circumstances be parties to any such operation except on the most stringent conditions that the loan will not be squandered. It may at once be conceded that the Treasury is, and has for some time past been, empty ; empty, that is to say, when any call is made on it for real public needs. I believe, however, that Persia can, and does, raise sufficient revenues to meet her expenditure, and in this opinion I am supported by Mr. A. O. Wood, the newly appointed Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who, from his long residence in the country, is well qualified to judge. M. Bizot also has expressed to me confidentially his opinion that financially Persia is by no means in so bad a case as is generally believed, but the efforts which have been made from very different motives by both theMedjliss and Reactionaries to prevent him from making any real examination of the situation, have been so successful that it would scarcely be just to him to quote his opinion as authoritative. It is at any rate now pretty certain, in spite of all reports to the contrary, that the Maliat, the chief source of internal taxation, has been collected much as usual for the past two years by the local Governors throughout the country. But it is equally certain that it was never applied to the proper purposes. During the era of the first Medjliss it is probable that the Governors, at the instigation of the Shah, alleged inability to collect it, and trusted to the general chaos to cover their defalcations by discreet bribery. Since the coup d’Etat of the 23rd June there is great reason to believe that the Governors have been made to disgorge very considerable sums, which have been used partly to pay the Royalist &lt;f troops ” and partly to satisfy the rapacity of the Court Camarilla. The Maliat receipts may thus never have reached the Treasury, but there is no ground for supposing that they have diminished, and as the revenues from the two other most important sources, viz., customs and telegraphs, have indubitably improved, it may be inferred that the total revenues of Persia are, at the worst, not smaller than three years ago. The question then arises is the revenue sufficient to meet the expenditure. VV ith proper control over the latter, I believe that it is. It may be admitted once more that the Persian Budget of to-day—if such a thing were ever compiled—would show a formidable excess over the expenditure of trventy years ago. It is, however, probable that the expenses necessary for the ordinary administration have altered but little, and that the only serious and inevitable addition to the Budget is the service of the debts incurred under the late Shah, the excess Budget being accounted for by the incredible development of the pension system, which is the bane of Persian finance. The annual total payable under this head is probably unknown, but how considerable it is may be judged from the fact that a pension once acquired is practically unextinguishable, since a trifling fee will insure its continuation to his descendants on the death ol the oiiginal [1925 ee—1]grantee. Moreover, a small pension could be bought for three or four years’ purchase, and pension orders (“ kabs ”) are so numerous that they are a common object of speculative purchase in the bazaars; three months ago, for instance, they were sold at 30 per cent, of their face value, but the report of an impending foreign loan or advance has now brought the price up to 50 per cent. Recognizing that it was the first step towards attaining financial equilibrium, the late Medjliss made an effort to suppress the great majority of these pensions, but was not strong enough to carry its well-meant intention into effect. Another flagrant instance of senseless expenditure is the extravagant number of useless officials in every public department; but the catalogue of abuses is almost endless, and enough has been said to show that even a half-hearted measure of reform and retrenchment would probably bring necessary expenditure down to the level of the receipts, while rigid economy might show 7 a respectable balance. It is, however, impossible to show any comprehensive figures; an approximate estimate of receipts might perhaps be attempted, but any figures given for expenditure would be scarcely better than guess work, and until the Financial Adviser has been furnished with data sufficient to prove the contrary I cannot abandon the belief that with fairly honest and intelligent administration the Persian Minister of Finance should be able to make both ends meet. These conclusions, if only approximately accurate, must necessarily affect the question of a loan. In the Russian Memorandum, of which Sir Arthur Nicolson has been so good as to send me a copy, no specific reasons for its necessity are given; it is only stated that the amount will be important and no figure is mentioned. The subject is one on which M. de Hartwig and I have agreed that we must await a definite expression of opinion from the Financial Adviser and we have never discussed it. M. Bizot, how 7 ever, seems to be no nearer to acquiring the necessary data to enable him to form such an opinion than he was within a month of his arrival, but from what he has said to me confidentally I gather that he is very sceptical as to the expediency of a loan in present circumstances. There are, of course, hug&amp; arrears of salaries and pensions; but it is probable that the claimants would be more than satisfied to compound for a trifling fraction of the amount nominally due, if they were assured of punctual payments in future. Under this heading, therefore, no very considerable sum need be estimated for. Arrears of pay due to the army are a convenient fiction invented in the interests of highly-placed personages, and can therefore be disregarded. There are, however, two financial operations of importance for which a loan might be justifiably utilized, he., the conversion of the advances from the English and Russian Bank which at present bear the high rate of interest of 12 per cent., and the payment of the floating debts of the Government to native bankers. What these latter may amount to is not known, but the total must be considerable. If carefully sifted, it w r ould almost certainly be found that a large proportion are not properly Government debts at all, but have been acknowledged as such through the influence of highly-placed personages, while the remaining creditors could not improbably be brought to agree to compound for a reasonable figure. Superficial as it necessarily is, I venture to think that this review of the position here is sufficient to show that the necessity, from a purely financial standpoint, of any considerable loan has still to be proved. But, from another point of view, a large foreign loan would be in the highest degree beneficial to Persia, inasmuch as it must, as I understand, be accompanied by conditions entailing a thorough reform of the financial system of the country. But here we are confronted with the lamentable fact that there is no effective desire for reform. I fear that if the experiment is tried, it will be found that officialdom, from the highest to the lowest ranks, the whole of the nobility and moneyed classes, and most of all the Shah’s entourage, will be opposed to it, and it is even doubtful whether the support of the Medjliss itself can be counted on.- The constitution of the body to be convoked on the 14th November under a new electoral law is still problematical; if it proves to be subservient to the Shah, or rather to the Court party, it will follow the line of conduct pointed out by them, and what that will be there can be no question; while if it should be of the same temper as the first Parliament, it will be suspicious of any scheme of reform inaugurated under Anglo- Russian auspices. In fact, if the small traders and artisans are Accepted, hostility is to be anticipated from all the urban population, w T hich alone is capable of making its influence felt, while the peasantry will remain indifferent on a question which they do not even understand. There is also another point to which I have to invite your attention, namely, that any scheme of financial reform, the execution of which is intrusted to Persians, must, ipso facto, fail. The causes are the inherent defects of the Persian character, oniii litoi lre is| mk^ which I need not dilate, but it is a fact I have never heard questioned by any compe tent and disinterested observer, either Persian or European. It follows, then, that European control in the Ministry of Finance—and perhaps, also, in the spending departments of the other Government offices—is indispensable. The conclusions at which I have arrived may be summed up as follows: That Persian finance is in by no means so desperate a state as appearances would seem to show; that while a small advance may be required to relieve urgent necessities, the need of any considerable foreign loan requires careful examination ; that the conditions of financial reform on which His Majesty’s Government will assent to a loan will be inacceptable to Persia ; and lastly, that no reform is possible unless carried out under European surveyance. There is, therefore, the prospect that His Majesty’s Government, by consenting to a loan, may be led into assuming indirectly a large measure of responsibility for the proper administration of Persian finances. Such control would undoubtedly be of the highest benefit to Persia, but it is for His Majesty’s Government to decide whether they are willing to share with Eussia the immense difficulties of such a task; and I venture with the greatest deference to suggest that if this question is to be considered in connection with a scheme of railways, our interests will best be served by advocating the latter project and reserving the question of financial reform for later discussion.

CONFIDENTIAL. [33439] No. 1 Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 28.) (No. 253.) Gulahek, September 10, 1908. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram No? c 244 of the 5th instant, in which you were so good as to inform me in what circumstances and on what conditions His Majesty’s Government would he willing, as was contemplated in 1906, to make, with Russia, a joint advance of 400,0001. to the Persian Government. I fear that there is little likelihood that the Financial Adviser will he in a position to justify such an advance within the immediate future. When, about two months ago, the possibility of an advance from Great Britain and Russia was first mooted, the Shah’s advisers, who were so elated at the prospect of having a substantial sum on which to lay their hands, were ready to promise to abide by any conditions that might be imposed, in the belief that they would always be able to evade them. They even went so far as to make a show of carrying out M. Bizot’s proposed reforms by allowing the Committee which he desired to create for the supervision of the Ministry of Finance to be appointed and to hold sittings, while orders were given though not executed—that each Department should prepare and submit a Budget of its annual expenditure. But they never had the smallest intention of relaxing their hold on the Treasury, and consequently the complementary measure of appointing a Treasurer under the direct orders and control of the Minister of Finance was never effected. On the contrary, a new Treasurer, the notoriously corrupt Naser-es-Sultaneh, vas appointed, and the waste and peculation of the public monies encashed by him goes on with increased facility. M. Bizot, who was at first encouraged by the^ Government s hypocritical professions to hope that something might be achieved m the way of reform, has now lost hope of effecting anything under the existing regime. On the 1st instant he obtained an audience of the Shah, in which he intended to expose to His Majesty the scandalous way in which the country’s revenues are being squandered, but the reception which he met with from the Shah was cold, almost to discourtesy, anc re thought it useless to carry out his intention. ; „ 1T M. Bizot would have, I think, no difficulty in producing a statement ol really urgent claims on the Treasury, such, for instance, as the arrears of salary due to the Persian Diplomatic and Consular Representatives abroad and to the 4 oreign O ce officials. I venture to think, however, that so long as the present camarilla under Amir Behadur Jang retains its power we should refuse even this assistance, lor the re le granted would merely mean that the small sums which are now secured for genuine public expenses would be embezzled. In these circumstances I think it would be m the true interests of Persia that, rather than give any financial assistance we should, on the contrary, seek to increase her embarrassments. So_ ong as ler ® an V prospect of screwing money out of the country so long the harpies a ou - c a wi resist reform, whether as a condition of_ a loan or through the agency of the Mej iss, and no more effective way of discouraging them occurs to me than ; ia 0 cu mg o every source of revenue which they can plunder. A beginning ® ma ^ ^ pressing vigorously for the payment of the overdue interest on the 1903-04 loan rom the revenues of the Gulf ports assigned as a contingent security for its service As you are aware, the establishment of the branch of the Russian Bank at Keimans a imminent, and as soon as it becomes a fact the customs receip s o a own, 1 paid to the Imperial Bank of Persia for the^ service of its loans and advances, will be encashed by the Banque d’Escompte. It will then be necessary to insib a of the Imperial Bank of Persia shall he transferred from Ivermanshah ™ c ' to demand that a large part of the customs revenues of Bushire, some 400,000 tomans per annum, shall be paid over to the bank. The extra s i aw m s P . , interest on the 1903-04 loan, viz., 13,6001. (68,000 tomans) may assist to break the As regards the two conditions formulated in your teiegram, the probabilities appear to be that the Shah will be obliged to convene Parliament before the I manciai [1925 ee—7] hf: d2 Adviser is in a position to recommend that an advance should he made, and I presume that should the Mejliss be sitting when the application is made His Majesty’s Govern ment would be disposed to consider that fact as sufficient fulfilment of the stipulation that the money is not to be used to suppress the Constitution. There is however always the possible contingency to be taken into account, that the new Mejliss may be so carefully packed, or so effectually intimidated by the Shah, that it would not defend its own existence. The second condition that there shall be proper guarantees for controllino- the expenditure of the money might be taken advantage of to extend the powers of the Financial Adviser. The two Legations have no effective means of exercising the control contemplated in connection with the proposed advance in 1906, hut if they were instructed to insist that the necessary supervision should be intrusted to M. Bizot that gentleman’s position would receive an accession of influence and authority which is at present sadly wanting. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHABLES M.

BY his note of the 31st August, 1907, His Majesty’s Minister had, the honour to inform your Highness of the terms on which His Britannic Majesty’s Government was prepared to assent to the request of the Persian Government for the suspension for three years of the sinking fund on the Loan of 1903-4. To this note no reply was made, but no payment on capital account was made, and the interest was, moreover, allowed to fall into arrears.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 193 of the 1st instant, I have the honour to report that M. Bizot, the financial Adviser, was summoned to Bagh-i-Shah on the 6th instant to explain to the Prime Minister, in whose favour the title of Grand Vizier has been revived, the nature of his proposals for the reorganization of the Ministry of linance. The result of the interview, which lasted over two hours, was discouraging. Two or three other Ministers besides Mushir-es-Sultaneh were present, and Amir Behadur Jang, who unites in his own person the two offices of Commander-in-chief (“ Sepahsalar ”) and Minister of War, occasionally put in a momentary appearance. His contribution to the discussion never went beyond an urgent demand for money. It would be tedious to repeat in detail the account which M. Bizot gave me of his experiences, and it will suffice to say that, with the sole exception of Ala-es-Sultaneh, who arrived near the end of the discussion, the Ministers and courtiers present one and all used language which showed that they had expected to find in M. Bizot a second M. ISaus, whose sole duty it was to find the means of raising money for them to squander. finally, however, M. Bizot managed to obtain a list of the ‘‘pressing needs” of the Persian Government. It ran as follows :— Improvement of army, expenses of arsenal, purchase of tents, and other necessary military expenditure Arrears of pay of troops and pay during 1 current year, and uniforms for troops Construction of frontier fortresses in Azerbaijan, Astara, Kermanshah, Seistan, and Baluchistan Payment of pensions fallen in arrears on account of recent disorders Balance of purchase-money of rifles, &amp;c., ordered by the late Shah, and purchase of new rifles and cartridges .. .. Total .. * Tomans. 500,000 500.000 300.000 200.000 500,000 2,000,000 Or, in round figures, 400,000/., the amount of the joint advance contemplated in the end of 1906. As M. Bizot observed, when he showed it to me the next morning, this remaikable production was unmistakably the work of Amir Behadur Jang, into whose hands 1,800,000 tomans out of 2,000,000 tomans would pass. While M. Bizot was with me, Kavam-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of Einance, was announced, and at my suggestion M. Bizot remained during his visit. After a little skirmishing the Minister asked M. Bizot to produce the list, and inquired what I thought of it. I replied by asking his Excellency if he expected that I should take such a proposal seriously. The Persian Government were asking us to advance a considerable sum, of which nine-tenths was to be confided to Amir Behadur Jang without any sort of guarantee that it would be properly expended, while the remainder was to be wasted in paying fraudulent pensions. I was sure that my Government would never listen to such a proposal, even if I consented to submit it, which I was not prepared to do. To my mind the proposal was nothing but a foolish attempt on the part of Amir Behadur Jang and his Iriends to line their own pockets, just as they might have hoped to do in similar circumstances under the old regime. His Excellency must be aware that His Majesty’s Government would never assent to assist the Persian Government to raise money for such a purpose. I was, I said, much disappointed at finding that the Persian Government clearly had no real intention of instituting reform in its finances. Kavam-ed-I)owleh was considerably disconcerted, and tried to argue that the Com mittee which M. Bizot was to form at the Department of Einance would prove an ample guarantee that the money, if advanced, would not be squandered. Haring been told by M. Bizot just before Kavam-ed-Dowleh’s arrival that his Excellency had proposed that three of the five seats on the Committee were to be occupied by the [1893 hh —27] lit2 Minister and his two sons, I replied that I must he satisfied of the composition of the Committee before I could put much faith in it, and went on to ask why, if the Goyernment really desired reform, no provision for the necessary expenditure it must entail appeared on the list of “pressing needs”; why, too, was there no mention of the payment of the salaries of the Persian Representatives abroad, which I had been told was a matter of such great urgency. M. Bizot warmly supported my arguments, pointing out that he, as Pinancial Adviser, could never recommend the Minister to adopt such a list as the' one furnished. 'Without details there could be no control over the expenditure. Did the Minister pretend that no other Department except the W r ar Office had any pressing ^ need for money? It was perfectly obvious that the list was drawn up without the smallest regard for the public interest. If the Persian Government expected to obtain any kind of assistance the Minister must aid him, M. Bizot, to ascertain how the financial position actually stands, and to draw up an accurate and detailed statement of the urgent wants of each Department. Kavam-ed-Dowleh appeared to he somewhat downcast at the result of the interview, hut M. Bizot assured me that his Excellency was perfectly aware that he had* come on a fools errand, and was probably only dismayed at the prospect of having to face Amir Behadur Jang and the Court camarilla with the confession of having achieved nothing. M. de Hartwig, to -whom I related the interview, seemed to me to be a little annoyed that I should have seen the “ list ” before himself, and to be less disposed than myself and the Einancial Adviser to condemn it as inacceptahle.

Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 17.) k 11 ’ „ .... Gulahek, August 1, 1908. THE proposals which the Financial Adviser laid before the Russian Minister and myself on the 26th and again on the 27th ultimo, after he had had a somewhat more detailed discussion with the Minister of Finance, have not yet taken a very definite shape, hut I venture to think that a general outline of them may he of interest. _M. Bizot particularly insists on the necessity of increasing the authority of the Minister of Finance, which at present is almost nil. Under the existing system the Minister of Finance has little oi no control over any of the revenue receipts wath the exception of the Customs, the others being nominally encashed by an independent Treasurer, who is apparently never called on to give an account of the moneys that are paid into his keeping. The latter functionary, again, appears to have the power to call on the provincial authorities to pay up the revenues for the collection of which they are responsible, this duty being nominally incumbent on the “ Mustaufis.” The “ Mustaufis ” are supposed to keep the Government accounts by a complicated system peculiar to themselves, and part of their duty is to adjust the financial dealings of the Central Government with the local authorities. For this purpose a “ Mustaufi ” resides in each provincial capital, and corresponds with one of the fraternity in Tehran specially detailed to deal with the money affairs of that province. They appear to be thoroughly corrupt, but so long as they furnish some kind of account—which no one can verify or even understand but themselves—of the funds they are supposed to encash, no questions are asked ; indeed, no one would appear to have the power to do so except those who are interested in keeping the veil drawn over their proceedings. M. Bizot desires to sweep away Treasurer and “Mustaufis” alike, and to appoint a small Committee of Control, nominally subordinate to the Minister of Finance, but really created for the purpose of controlling his actions. This Committee would, in fact, be an advisory body without whose assent the Minister could take no action. As regards the organization of the Ministry, M. Bizot is in favour of the simplest scheme possible, as anything at all complicated would leave the door open to the trickery and embezzlement so dear to the Persian official mind. The revenues of Persia are very simple, being practically confined to the “ Maliat ” and the Customs, though there are a few other minor sources. The amount of the “ Maliat ” for each province is known, and cordd be used as a working basis to begin with, though later on it might be readjusted so as to secure the considerably larger revenues which it is believed should be obtained. There would seem, therefore, to be but little difficulty in forming a revenue branch, provided an honest official can be secured to preside over it. On the expenditure side, however, more building up wdll be required. Hitherto there has been no such thing as a Budget—the Persian mind seems to be incapable of grasping such an idea. M. Bizot has tried to explain it, but without success. The officials at the Ministry of Finance admit that expenditure and revenue should be made to balance, but they ask how can this be done when the customs revenue is an uncertain figure. The customs receipts, they argue, must therefore be left out of the Budget, and the ordinary expenditure cut down to the known amount of the “ Maliat ” and the other fixed sources of revenue. It seems that this has actually been done of late, and that the surplus customs receipts, after payment of the charges on them, have been looked upon as an extraordinary fund whence all sorts of unforeseen and unauthorized expenditure could be met. M. Bizot, however, believes that it will be possible to draw up expenditure estimates sufficiently accurate to form a provisional Budget. He also proposes that the Customs and the Mint should be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. It is evident, however, that the success of his scheme, as he admits himself, depends entirely on the composition and powers of the Committee of Control. M. Bizot believes that he' can name two or three honest and capable Persians who could be placed on it. I myself feel some doubt whether any Persians could be found of sufficient [1893 r—1]2 strength, of character, even with a “ Medjliss ” to support them, to withstand pressure from the Shah or his entourage, and of course there is always the possibility to be guarded against that the honest may he dismissed and replaced by more subservient men. A European element in the contemplated Committee seems therefore indispensable to give it the necessary stiffening to secure honest administration. How to secure this is M. Bizot’s chief difficulty. He understands that neither Great Britain nor Russia desire to employ their own subjects, which might produce an appearance of joint control, and he would like, if possible, to appoint Europeans already in the service of the Persian Government, such as M. Kornard, the Administrator of Customs or possibly M. Wibier, who is also in the Customs, but whose reputation, perhaps 5 not wholly deserved, for being always ready to serve the interests of one foreign Legation or another rather disposes M. Bizot against him. But even presuming that a satisfactory Committee could be formed with proper security for its permanence, there still remains the difficult question of where to find the personnel requisite to organize a reasonably efficient Finance Department. Per sonally, I am convinced that it will be an almost impossible task, unless a certain number of the more responsible officials are Europeans. I think that, on the whole M. Bizot is of the same way of thinking. M. Bizot was received in audience by the Shah on the 30th, and gave His Imperial Majesty an outline of the reforms which he proposed. The Shah raised no objections whatever, but rather professed the greatest readiness to give his assistance, especially for the formation of the Committee of Control. It is, however, impossible to say what value can be attached to His Majesty’s promises. At present they may be sincere enough, as it has been impressed on him that on his acceptance of an effective scheme of reform depends the possibility of obtaining money to carry on the Government. M. Bizot was careful to explain to His Majesty that he had not come to offer an advance from the two Governments, but rather to explain that they would not even take into consideration the question of assisting Persia in her present financial embarrassment, except on a definite pledge that the work of reform would be seriously taken in hand. M. de Hartwig believes that the Shah realizes this perfectly well. As regards the courtiers and Ministers, it is very' probable that they are ready to advise His Majesty to accept any and every condition that may be attached by the two Powers to a joint advance should they agree to make one, but this complaisant attitude is probably due to the hope that they will be able to lay hands on the money, and I expect that ^ when it is discovered that it is strictly 7 tied up and beyond their reach they will, with few exceptions, throw every obstacle in the way of the reforms being accepted and executed. ^ There can be no question but that money is urgently needed ; yet while the Persian Government has been driven to the most desperate resorts to obtain it, as for instance, by anticipating the customs receipts, by “squeezing” the wealthy men who figured in the Constitutional party, or by borrowing at ruinous interest from the bazaars, no attempt is made to secure the rights of the State in the most obvious transactions, lb quote an instance, I may mention that the Mint is coining all silver that is offered to it, but the very considerable profits—probably 10 per cent.—go, not to the Government, but to the Director of the Mint, who gives no account of his stewardship. No one, indeed, knows whether the Mint or the telegraph service is carried on en regie or en affermage, and only one thing is certain, namely, that the State is being defrauded. This lamentable chaos is due partly to the Shah’s incapacity and weakness, and partly to the intrigues of his entourage, who, uncertain how long the present regime will last, desire to make the most of their opportunities. So bad is the credit of the Government that both the English and Russian Banks— the latter on the express order of the Russian Minister—have absolutely declined to allow the most trifling temporary accommodation even on the security of the customs. Notwithstanding this, some of the Shah’s advisers, and in particular Mushir-ed-Dowleli, are assuring His Majesty that money can easily be borrowed, and it is not impossible that, should Great Britain and Russia refuse to come to his assistance, the Shah may be tempted to seek accommodation abroad, giving as security the unassigned surplus of the customs revenues. # Commercially speaking, of course, such an operation is almost impossible, but as a speculation some minor banking house or Syndicate might be found to advance a small sum, trusting to the influence of its Government to obtain repayment, and of course a Government interested in obtaining the right to interfere in Persian affairs might be happy to avail itself of the pretext. lo preclude such a possibility, small as I feel it is, but still more to commence thework of reform, in the interests of which the appointment of a Financial Adviser was so warmly urged by ns on the Persian Government, I venture to think that it is worthy of consideration whether the two Powers should not agree to make a joint advance to Persia. Reform will not be accepted, I fear, for its own sake, but merely as the only terms on which money can be obtained, and we must also be prepared to see that, as soon as the money is available, every effort to squander it and evade reform will be made. The most stringent piarantees will be necessary if any useful end is to be achieved, and it will be M. Bizot’s task to devise the necessary conditions. He is now engaged in ascertaining what would be the minimum amount of the advance required to tide the Government over its present difficulties, and, further, how best to secure that it is not diverted from its legitimate objects. He would then communicate his proposals to M. de Hartwig and myself for submission to our Governments, and, on learning that they are not opposed in principle to granting an advance, would submit a scheme for the reorganization of the Finance Department, on the acceptation of which the advance woidd be made to depend. The advance woidd presumably imply a subsequent loan, but M. Bizot seems at present inclined to think that such a loan would not be of a very large amount, and that the revenues of the country, honestly administered, should prove sufficient for the purposes of the Government.

He thinks, however, that need is so urgent that Shah and Ministers would consent to any terms, and that opportunity might be taken to obtain reorganization of Ministry of Finance. He suggests that repayment of advance could be secured by making it a first charge on a loan to be negotiated after the meeting of Parliament. He suggests the advance should he used for purposes to be approved beforehand by the two Legations. He wishes to talk over these proposals with Russian Minister and myself on Monday. Russian Minister fears that unless loan is agreed to Shah may he persuaded by his entourage to borrow from private German banks at ruinous interest, and that money would he squandered.

SHAH’S expenses in paying troops, &amp;c., during past month must have been heavy, and will increase, as Cossack Brigade is being augmented by active recruiting, and there is a sum payable on consignment of rifles, &amp;c., from Creuzot.. recently landed at Enzeli.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram No/ 98 of the 14th instant, in which you are so good as to authorize me to inform the Persian Government that, in view of the non-payment of the interest on the 1903-4 advance due on the 4th April and also of the sinking fund for the last two years, and in view also of their failure to make any reply to Sir C. Spring-Rice’s note of the 31st August, 1907, announcing the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree to the suspension of the sinking fund for three years, His Majesty’s Government can no longer admit of any discussion on those terms. It would, I think, cause needless irritation, and would therefore be impolitic, to make that communication just at present. Nor is there now the same necessity to take the step as appeared to me to he the case when I first suggested it for your consideration. At that time there was good reason to believe from the statements of M. Mornard that the Persian Govern ment were actually in a position to pay off both interest and sinking fund, and thus liberate themselves from the conditions we sought to impose on them. This is, however, not now the case ; the Persian Government is in the direst straits for money, and, if M. Mornard’s forecasts are correct as to the customs revenues, it is certain that the interest on the loan will again be very much in arrear. In the circumstances, therefore, I propose to avail myself of the latitude which your telegram allows me, and to reserve the communication for a more pressing occasion. I have, &amp;c.

[May 11.] Section 4. ri5988] ^ Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 11.) 91.) gir, Tehran, April 23, 1908. IN a conversation which I had with M. de Hartwig on the 13th instant I mentioned to him that you had suggested to the Russian Government that, in order to prevent any third Power from obtaining a right to intervene in Persian financial matters, he and I should make a joint communication to the Persian Government to the effect that, in the event of that Government desiring to place any further charge on the customs revenues, the Governments of Great Britain and Russia would expect, in view of their interest in those revenues, to be consulted in the matter. M. de Hartwig said that it would not be easy for him to make such a communica tion. He could not very well make the subvention to the German school a pretext for such a de'marche, as he had received assurances from Mushir-ed-Dowleh that the subsidy would not be paid from the customs, or, if it was, that the sum would be deducted from the Shah’s Civil List, which is payable from the customs; moreover, he was quite convinced that the Assembly would never permit a payment to be made from public funds except with its explicit consent. Then, again, should he make such a declaration, it would be open to the Persian Government to reply that Russia s interest in the customs was perfectly safe, inasmuch as he, the Minister, had already laid his hands on every custom-house pledged to secure the service of Russian loans. I said that I quite saw his position, and that personally I was rather inclined to agree with his views as to taking the German school subvention as the text of the proposed communication. Like himself, I thought there was but little danger of the subsidy being taken from the customs if the Assembly could prevent it; but, on the other hand, the Shah would scarcely submit to be tricked out of 12,000 tomans, and it was not impossible that, under pressure from the German Legation, the money would be paid somehow. The Gei mans could then claim that it came from the customs, and with the statement m Mushir-ed- Dowleh’s note promising the subvention, and that it would be secured on the customs, they would have a pretty good case. . . . . His other objection was, however, unanswerable, for, as Russia was m a position to collect all the revenues assigned to her, she had no special cause for prohibiting e Persian Government from disposing ot any surplus that remained, after^ ussian wan s had been satisfied, in any way they thought fit. 1 said that His Majesty s oveinmen were not in the same fortunate position, and I thought that the joint Declaration would produce a salutary effect. M. de Hartwig rejoined that another objection ° J oin . a ? was that the two Powers had not got the customs as a whole pledged to them jointly, though between them they held a lien on the customs revenues o t ie V L° e m P lie &gt; and this seemed to him to make a joint demarche somewhat illogical. However, as pressed the point, he said he would not refuse to make a joint verbal representation should his Government agree to the proposal. n I venture to think that M. de Hartwig’s arguments contained a good deal of force. Under her Loan Agreements Russia is empowered in case the interest fal ' 3 “ to ea h * to herself collect the customs receipts assigned for the service of a • security she possesses is thus so absolute that she cannot well pietend to be anxious about it. oir position, however, is quite different, inasmuch as we are not entitled to encash the revenues of the customs assigned to us, and the effect is seen m the fact that the' te;est on the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903-4 for 1905-6 was paid e eveu m t u arrear and that for 1906-7, due on the Ith instant, is again overdue, \\ hile the sinking fund for both periods also remains unpaid. This very fact combine wi ® ai ® the Persiau Government to give a reply to us respecting the condition we attach to the susnension of the sinking fund, seems, however, to me to offer the opportunity o making our position secure against the possibility ot the Persian Government admitting the interference of a third Power in Persian financial matters by giving a hen on he customs of the south. I therefore ventured to suggest in my telegram Nm 86 of the 31st March that I should be authorized to send in a note to the Pei^an Government stating that in the above-mentioned circumstances no discussion of the condi [2952 Z—4]attached to our assent to the suspension of the sinking fund will be admitted hv FT Majesty’s Government. ^ 18 It appears to me that by making a communication in this sense we shall be in a position at least as strong as that of Russia, and that we have more grounds for makincr it, for, although, like ourselves, Russia has received no reply as to the suspension of the sinking fund, nor any payment on that account, she was, if she so desired, always in * position to attach the sums due on capital account, which we were not, unless we 1 withheld the payments due by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, a sten which I uould strongly deprecate as endangering the renewal of the Tele^ranh Concessions. b ^ There is not, so far as I am able to see, the smallest probability that the Persian Government will be able to make any payments to us in the immediate future. Almost the whole of the anticipated royalties for 1911 from the Caspian Sea fisheries have already been paid over to the Persian Government, and no doubt are already expended and only a very small balance—less, M. Ostrogradsky informs me, than 6,000/.—remains! The revenues from the customs are appropriated ten times over, and, except from Khora-san and Seistan, scarcely anything is coming in on account of internal taxation. The need for sending in the communication which I have ventured to urge on your consideration is therefore not pressing, unless, indeed, I should receive a reply on the subject of the suspension of the sinking fund, of which I should of course apprise you bv telegraph.

The accompanying query raiseu ly the Auuitor is forwarded with a view to such action as the Political Secretary may consider necessary. The file of Persian Confidential Papers ( 32,058 and 33 , 304 ) shows that a loan to the Persian Government of £ 400,000 was contemplated, of which India was to find £ 100 , 000 . The loan was to be negotiated through the agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia anu was to bea^ interest at the rate of 5 per cent, of which 4 per cent was to go to the lenders, while the Bank would retain a commission of 1 per cent per annum fo&gt;' its services. The Loan however^was never accepted by the Persian Government and the sum of £ 100 , 000 , which had been provided and paid over to the Bank oi Persia to be held by them under the orders of Sir C.

The Bank would appear to have simply acted as agents, and oy the failure of the negotiations, they have lost a lucrative ? I commission of £4,000 per annum. It was probably of some advantage to the Bank to have the £100,000 in their balances, but it seems fair to assume that no specific investment could be made by them, and under the circumstances it would hardly seem correct to make enquiries on tne subject. Any loss by India of interest which may have arisen therefore appears to have been unavoidable, anu I shoulu oe disposed to think that the Imperial Government, if approached with a view to their sharing an undefined loss of this kind, would consider that their guarantee only became operative in case of actual loss by the default of the Persian Government in case the loan were a -ranged. Under the arrangement recently made with the foreign Office in regard to the ’’Arrears Account” to be kept for the purpose of arriving at the share of luss to be borne by the Imperial Government, approved Council 11th February 1908, it is stipulated that the Persian Government shall not be charged interest on any instalment that is overdue for a, shorter rjeriod than one year, and that the Foreign Office will not be called upon by this Department to meet any claim for. a slight temporary loss.CONFIDENTIAL. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 31, 10 P.M.) (No. 86. Very Confidential.) Tehran, March 31, 190S, 12 40 p.m. FINANCE. ^ Your telegram No. 35. In answer to my note of 24th February respecting sinking fund, I received an acknowledgment stating that Minister of Finance was preparing a reply. Minister for Foreign Affairs told me yesterday that I should in a day or two receive that reply, and he added, Minister of Finance is making arrangements for payment of sum overdue for sinking fund. He could not tell me tenour of reply. Persian Government may also he able to pay total instalment due on 4th April, as Caspian Sea Fisheries royalties are again available, and would cover it. It seems clear that an effort is to be made to avoid acceptance of our conditions as to suspension of sinking fund, and probably in particular that relating to our having first refusal of any proposed loan, the idea being that the Persian Government could raise a loan independently of us, on security of southern customs. Though I may receive promised reply and perhaps also overdue instalment of sinking fund, it is more than probable that instalment due on 4th April will not he paid punctually. In that case, I might inform Persian Government, in reply to their note, if received, that His Majesty’s Government must in the circumstances decline to. entertain any discussion of our conditions for suspension of sinking fund. To effect a loan in the present condition of Persia would, as a commercial trans action, be impossible, but on political grounds a small advance secured as a second mortgage ” on the Gulf customs might be found in Germany, and with precedent of our own loan, Russia might not find it convenient to forbid it. If, in order to gain a foothold in the Gulf, Germany should try this move a prohibition on our part to the Persian Government to pledge Gulf customs^ as security might bring us into an awkward conflict with her. To obviate such a contingency the simplest means would seem to be to prevent Persian Government making any immediate payment on account of service of our loan, which could be done if Manager of Imperial Bank of Persia were instructed from London to encash all payments made by Persian Government against overdrafts of various Government accounts. Manager should not be informed of the real reason. I hesitate to suggest such tactics, but the course proposed may avert graver difficulties later on ; Persian Minister of Finance is showing an unexpected independence of Financial Adviser, and although this will not last, it will be difficult to combat for a time.M [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA.

Your Excellency, Tehran, February 24, 1908. IT is now about six months since, by his note of the 31st August, 1907, His Majesty’s Minister had the honour to inform your Excellency’s predecessor of the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government were disposed to assent to the request of the Imperial Government for the suspension for three years of the payments on account of the sinking fund of the loan of 1903—4. No reply to that communication has, however, yet been received, nor has the Imperial Government made payment of the amount overdue for sinking fund since the 4th April, 1907. Under these circumstances I have the honour to inform your Excellency, under the instructions of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that His Britannic Majesty’s Government consider that, by failing to effect any payment, and notwithstanding the repeated verbal representations which I have had the honour to make on the subject, by neglecting to give any reply to Sir C. Spring-Rice’s above- mentioned note, the Persian Government have tacitly accepted the conditions set forth therein. I avail, &amp;e. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. [2872 S —8]VrY i ^ ■' V [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] in yonr telegram NoT 203 of the 19th December, and when on the 27th January, Mushir-ed-Dowleh informed me that the moneys would he paid forthwith, I hoped that the desired result was attained. On the following day, however, M. Mornard, the Administrator of the Customs, informed me that no order for the payment to be effected had reached him, nor had he any reason to anticipate that such an order was likely to be issued for the moment. In these circumstances it appeared to me requisite that stronger pressure should be applied, and I, therefore, ventured to ' ^ suggest by my telegram No/34 of the 28th January, that I might be authorized to inform the Persian Government that, in view of the time which they had allowed to pass without replying to the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree to the suspension of the sinking fund, His Majesty’s Government considered those conditions to have been tacitly accepted. There is no doubt that the prospect that their liberty to raise a foreign loan might be still further circumscribed than at present has far greater weight with the Persian Government than any claim for money however strongly pressed, and I therefore hoped that a communication in the sense above indicated would serve to clinch the matter. There was also every prospect that, with the interminable delays consequent on the existing system of referring all public questions to committees of Assembly, no reply would have been given to my note, and the tacit acceptance of our conditions would have been acquired. On the 6th instant the Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me that the moneys had actually been paid, but inquiry at the bank showed that His Excellency was mistaken. The dismissal of M. Mornard from the post of Administrator of Customs left the custody of the revenues of that department in the hands of the Minister of Commerce, Kaim Makam, who is remarkable even in Persia for corruption and peculationj and the prospect of the moneys set aside for meeting the debt due to His Majesty’s Government being paid seemed to be seriously jeopardised. I therefore, on the 8th instant, in speaking to Mushir-ed-Dowleh on the subject of M. Mornard’s dismissal, insisted that his Excellency should write to Kaim Makam and warn him against touching these funds. His Excellency agreed to do so, but said that the order for payment was already issued. On the following day M. Mornard called on me and informed me that the order was prepared and required only the signature of the Minister of Finance; he believed I could count on seeing the payment made within twenty-four hours, and, Mr. llabino, who happened to come in at the moment, thought tliat I could regard the question as settled. On the evening of the 11th, however, Mr. llabino informed me that he had encashed nothing and, as I had not received your authority to make a communication in the sense of my telegiam above mentioned, 1 addressed the note, of which a copy is inclosed, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mmshir-ed-Dowleh, to whom I handed the note peisonally, again asserted that the money had actually been paid, and seemed much surprised when I assured him that such was not the case. It is quite possible, as the Minister assured me, that the order for payment s prepared, and only requires the signature of the Minister of Finance. The anxiety Oi. his Excellency Nizam-es-Sultaneh for the life of his only son, who has ^ been dangerously ill, and the interruption of business consequent on the religious observances of the “ Katl” may have well prevented the accomplishment of the last formality; but on the other hand, it seems probable that the campaign of intrigue against M\ Mornard has been an equally important factor.

I understood you to say that the instalment pay able by Persia in each of the three years during which capital payments are suspended will still be taken at Q £23,270:7/- as for the other years of the terra; and that the amount by which the suras actually paid in each of these three years falls short of £23,270:7/- will be debited to the 'arrears account' and charged interest at Is this correct? Yours truly,India Office, 6th Ap r il, 1 Dear Eitchie $ In our memorandum regarding the Persian loan we were at great pains to propose arrangements of the most extreme simplicity and I am disappointed that the Treasury should find any difficulty in following them,* Perhaps Pumsay would kindly call hare ana I could discuss with him the points that n -ad olucidaticn. ■'eanwhile the following explanation may be useful The debt of 000 (net) having been converted into a teminable annuity ending in 1 w24, there are two methods of jroviding for the possihi 1 ity of default o?i the j-art of the debtor* A. On e method is to treat the annuity as a series of separate debts payable at specific dates. and to tell the Persian Government that if they do not pay each of them at the proper date the amount unpaid will be treated as an arrear, interest bring charged on all arrears outstanding for more than 1' months* calculations which this method 'squires are purely arithmetical an, the full accounts can be prepared in a HmHhHSSb) n form which no one can fail to understand. 3. The other method is as follows:- As each annuity payment rej resents an instalment of capital together with interest on the outstanding portion of the debt (the calculations being made in such a manner that full regular j ayments would discharge the whole debt by 1924), it is i o ssible fn the event of default or partial iefault^, in any one payment of cap ital^ to recalculate the amount of the annuity that should b&amp; 4'/ ^ fv paia for the remaining perioa. The original calculation f • (a('j ■'a 16n'ch 1 '') is given in Sir 0. Spring Pice's letter x of 28th February, 1907. w e have received the first n he pamentsto be made on 4th 1 JL r k * * \Jlr b t LS ^ f l ^ U t it J &gt;ril, 1205, in respect of interest) two p ayments and the interest &gt; shown in Sir C.

If the 1 capital payments that shoula be made in the 3rd, 4th ana 3th years are postponed, it will be necessary (if the method now under consideration is to be adopted) to revise all the calculations both of interest ana of capital instalments for all years from the 4th onwards. The interest payments will have to be revised because the amount of capital outstanding at the end of each year will be larger than wasvus assumed ta Sir 0. Spring Rice 's calculation; and the capital payments ' loul have to be raised because the capita! of o£272.0201 lo. 7. outstanding at the end of the second year will have to be paid off in 10 years (years 6 to 20) instead of in 2a years (years 3 to 20). This method has three defects (l) It involves a disproportionate mount of trouble* The calculations mould have to be made (or at least aerified) on each occasion by our actuary* (2) It is very doubtful whether the Persian officials would understand what was being done on each occasion* They would certainly not understand without elaborate explanation* (In order to show how great is the liability to misunderstanding I may point cut that even the Treasury is under a misapprehension as to the mount of interest due in the 3rd, 4th and 3th years* ' 7 % Ramsay assumes that it is 3 p* c* on the amount of the loan on which the annuity has been calculated, (which through inau.vertence he states at 2300,000 in stem of 1230*000)* As a matter of fact the amount duo, accoraing to Sir C* Spring RicQ*$ table m the 2ru year is 3113*601, (viz:** 3 p*c* on *272*020 being the capital outstanding at the end of the year)- Sir C. Spring Rice shows smaller amounts for each subsequent year, on the assumption that the sinking fund, 'j v. 1 ' A o fund paijmmts will be made. So long as they are suspended, t 7 w annual interest will continue to be did. 601 . When they are resumed, X cannot say what the amount will be). (j) The annuity can be recalculated by ordinary actuarial methods whenever there is a default in the sinking fund payments; but it is by no means clear what should be done when there is a default in interest payments, I suppose that the overdue interest should be added, to capital; but this would introauGe serious complications anu liability to controversy. If, in spite of what X have saia, the Treasury abject to the proj’Csal in oar ^ enorandum, thev will no aoubi prejare details counter proposals for cur consideration, dealing with all possible coniingencies, I do not understand the paragraphs of I r Ramsay 9 s letter marked B. d C, One of the conditions of the joint loan was that any loss was to be snared between the two Governments, The Treasury cannot now 'stipulate 19 that this condition is to be waived. A reasonable agreement must of course be made as to then the period of default that is to be allowed to elapse before the Treasury is called upon; and cur j rc; osal appears to be extremely reasonable. But of course the Treasury may, in their counterproposals suggest some other arrangements. Yours sincerely. ir Bichnond Ri tch ie, T. C • InNo. 1. Foreign Office to Treasury.

In reply to my representations, I have more than once received promises on both points, but so far these assurances have been unfulfilled.

I told his Excellency that there appeared to be scane confusion as to the proportions of the instalments representing interest and si g fund Xich were in rolnd figures, 13,0001. and 9,000/. respectively, and that I looked on the sum which his Excellency had said has been paid as an instalment of interest, and honed the balance would soon be foi thcoming. i u p Sir ed-Dowleh said that he hoped to be able to give me a reply about the suspension of the sinking fund in a few days, but, unless h VSets a shaip reminder fear that his promise, like so many others will remain SJ™ No 34 of the stnuops I think it would be expedient, as I suggested m m} teiegiam •. . 28th instant, that the Persian Government should 'f . illf 7^ 1 kt:S^no“sT he the time they have allowed to pass without replying to the Lejatmn “^ es ° ; 31st August the 15th October, and the 9th December, His Majesty s government well that our position m this matter should becleaily V-ime .

His Majesty’s Government have learned with pleasure that the Imperial Govern ment and the Sacred National Assembly are taking energetic measures for necessary reforms, the establishment of financial equilibrium, and for the development of trade. They have also taken note of your statement that these measures require reasonable time to he successful, and that at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and of the objects in view. They fully appreciate the sentiments expressed by your Highness on behalf of the National Assembly as to the friendship existing between the two States, which they sincerely reciprocate. After duly considering the contents of your letter and the arguments which you have so ably urged, they have instructed me to consent to the request of the Persian Government that a delay of three years may be allowed during which nothing should he paid on account of the sinking fund, but only interest, in order that the Persian Government and the National Representatives may have time to carry on the necessary reforms and to put the income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. I am to add that, in consenting to this request, His Majesty’s Government under stands that the following conditions will be observed. Firstly, in accordance with the general law as to debtors and creditors, it is under stood that the Persian Government, on its side, will not contract any new foreign loan without givino* their creditors, England and Russia, the option of advancing money on the same &amp; conditions. The reason of this condition will be plain to you, for according to law and custom a debtor who makes an arrangement with a creditor must engage not to incur new debts from other quarters without first giving the option to his original creditOit ^ un(iersto0( i t i iat t } ie Persian Government, in the general interests of freedom of commerce, strictly maintains the promise made by the Attabek on the 27th October, 1901, and confirmed in the present year, to the effect that “ the Persian Government will not grant to any one the monopoly of coining silver in the State Mint and that in the matter of the importation of silver all persons, whether Persians or foreigners, will be treated equally and without distinction.” _ + Thirdly it is understood that His Majesty s Government has consented to the request of the Persian Government and to waive the rights secured to them by engage- [2633 gg —22]ment m order that the Government and the Mejlis may have time to necessary reforms, and put the expenditure and income of the country^ ° n ^ footing.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 144 of the 12th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith translation of a note addressed to me on the 23rd instant by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs respecting a delay of three years in the payment of sinking fund on the debt due by the Persian Government to British creditors.

YOUR Excellency is well aware of the energetic measures taken by the Imperial Government and the Sacred National Assembly for necessary reforms, establishment of financial equilibrium, and for the development of trade, but it is obvious that these measures require reasonable time to be successful, and at least a period of three years is required for the achievement of these reforms and the objects in view. The National Assembly, being alive as to the friendship existing between the two States and the help always given by the British Government to promote the interests of this Imperial Government, have specially proposed to the Foreign Office that, by the help of the English and the Russian Representatives, a delay may be allowed for the payment of the coupons of the loans to the Banks, i.e. y a delay of three years may he allowed during which nothing should be paid on account of the sinking fund but only interest. When during the period above mentioned the financial reforms in view are done it may become possible to increase the sinking fund in a suitable manner so that the debt may be paid off sooner. It is hoped that by this friendly help the Persian Government and the National Representatives may have time to carry on the necessary reform and to put the income and expenditure of the country on a proper footing. With the perfect confidence that the Persian officials have always had in the friendship and good intentions of the British authorities, your Excellency is requested to bring this intention and request of the Imperial Government to the notice of the proper authorities and to strengthen in this respect the good will of the British Government towards that of Persia in order that on the present occasion when the Persian Government is engaged in reforms the British Government may increase the friendship between the two States by accepting this request and helping in this matter as they have always done in the interests of this Imperial Government.

Since then I have constantly reminded his Excellency of the subject, and I have repeatedly pressed upon him orally and in writing the reasons which make it desirable to come to an early decision. On the 14th instant, as his Excellency had intimated that the difficulty lay with the Minister of Finance, I obtained his consent to my discussing the question with M. Kokovtzoff, with whom I had an appointment on the following day in reference to another matter! M. Kokovtzoff expressed to me the strongest aversion to making the advance at all; — but I need not trouble you with his views on the subject, because he added that he had been overborne by M. Isvolsky, and was prepared to find the money provided that he was satisfied as to the existence of good security for its repayment. But this was not the case. The figures in his possession showed that the northern customs revenues of Persia did not afford a sufficient margin, after paying off the interest on the existing Russian debt, to guarantee the service of the Russian share of the proposed advance. In reply to a question which I put to him, the Minister said that ho had taken into account the profits of the Mint. The security was still insufficient. He went on to say that Russia’s position was very different from that of Great Britain. The latter had a far smaller debt and the Gulf ports as security. Upon this I asked whether he would be satisfied if the surplus revenues from the southern as well as the northern customs were made jointly available as security for the service of the whole advance of 400,0001., explaining of course that this was only a personal suggestion. He said that he would be perfectly contented with such an arrangement provided another point was revenues by 50,0001. I at once acquainted the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the result of my conversation with M. Kokovtzoff. M. Isvolsky saw the Finance Minister the same evening, and to-day informed me verbally that the Russian Government agreed in principle to the advance suggested by His Majesty’s Government, provided (1) that the proposal to remit the duty on silver was dropped, and (2) that sufficient security was forthcoming for the service of the advance. He added that the suggestion which I had made to the Finance Minister as to treating the surplus revenues from the southern and northern customs as a consolidated security for the whole advance would facilitate matters, and was acceptable to the Russian Government. I reminded him that the suggestion was only a personal one. His Excellency further stipulated that the advance should not be granted to the Persian Government until the two representatives considered that an opportune moment for doing so had arrived. In this connection I should explain that, ever since x the two representatives at Tehran expressed the opinion that in view of the unsatis- ^ PoraGn Government the advance ought to be held m abeyance, settled. The proposed admission into Persia of silver free of duty must be abandoned by the Persian Government, for it would mean a reduction of the northern customs discretion being left to the representatives as to the time of I have, &amp;c.

Foreign Office, June IS, 1910. ^ clirected by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer to my letter of the 19th February, setting forth the conditions on which His Majesty’s and the Russian jO\ernments had decided to comply with the request of the Persian Government for the advance of a sum of 400,000L, and to the last paragraph of my letter of the 21st April, stating that the question of making this advance was indefinitely suspended. 1 am to state that on the 23rd ultimo His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Tehran reported by telegraph that Nasr-ul-Mulk, a prominent Persian statesman not at present a holder of office in the Persian Government, had, in conversation, reverted to the question of a joint advance by the two Powers, and that he himself and the Russian Minister had already receive^ vague intimations that financial assistance in this form would be welcome to the Persian Government. Nasr-ul-Mulk had stated that the Persian Cabinet had come to realise the necessity of solidarity and of friendly and intimate relations with the two Powers, and to under stand that the conditions attached by the latter to the advance on the last occasion when the question had arisen, which had alarmed public opinion and caused the rejection of the offer, were formulated as a defence of the lenders’ interests, and did not indicate the existence of any designs on their part against Persia. The Persian Government had since satisfied the two Powers on one of the points insisted on in the conditions and were about to do the same on another, viz., the engagement of European experts as advisers to the Persian Ministry of Finance. They were in serious need of money, and had practically pledged themselves not to obtain it except through the two Powers, to whose assistance they had therefore a strong moral claim. Mr. Marling further reported that the Persian Minister of Finance had had a long and friendly conversation with the Russian Minister on the same subject, and that the two representatives were agreed that a very perceptible change had recently taken place in the attitude of the Persian Government towards the two Powers, and were of opinion that it would be unwise to neglect the opportunity offered of gaining the confidence of Persia by giving a tangible proof of the friendly feeling of Great Britain and Russia towards that country. Mr. Marling accordingly suggested that, provided that foreign financial advisers were engaged, the two Powers should make the advance without further conditions, except such as might be necessary to furnish security for its service and repayment in the event of the flotation of a subsequent larger loan. He was of opinion that such a step would inspire confidence and give stability to the present Persian Cabinet. Sir E. Grey, who shared the view expressed by Mr. Marling, accordingly addressed on the 25th ultimo a telegram to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, instructing him to ascertain the views of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on this proposal, and to inform his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government, being of opinion that the two Powers should do all they could to encourage the friendly overtures of the Persian Government, were prepared to provide their share of an advance of 400,0001. without conditions, provided that the Russian Government would agree to do the same. The Russian Government have now signified their acquiescence in this proposal, but no formal request for the assistance required has yet been received from the Persian Government ^ latter point) Mr. Marling reported by telegraph on the 16th instant that their reluctance to apply for it was in a great measure due to the belief that they could obtain the money from other private sources on easier terms than from the two Powers, and that the latter could not object to their having recourse to the quarter indicated for that purpose. . . t. ... i • . . • Such a course would be, for various reasons, detrimental to British interests m Persia, and Mr. Marling suggested in the circumstances that the two I owers, m ordei to convince the Persian Government of their desire to assist them, should reduce to [2781 s —3] ^ a ¥I iH •5 per cent, the rate of interest to be demanded ^ ^^^S’dinssion! remembered, was fixed at 7 per cent, when e qn i p 1903 and 1904. though 5 per cent, is the rate borne by the Ango-n i M H d has reported to M.

LANGLEY.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government,] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [June 20.] Section 5 . [ 21975 ] No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 20.) (No. 86. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, June 3, 1910. I CALLED on the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 28th ultimo, and enquired what impression the joint declaration explaining the wishes of Great Britain and Russia in regard to the grant of concessions affecting their political or strategic interests had produced on the Cabinet, and gave his Excellency to understand very clearly that His Majesty’s Government did not consider that the note required an answer, and would, indeed, prefer that none should be sent. Moavin-ed-Dowleh said that internal affairs had occupied the Government so much that they had had no time to give the note proper consideration, but be thought personally that they would wish to utilise the opportunity of replying to moot other questions which they desired to discuss. His Excellency was obviously extremely anxious not to commit himself, and I could extract nothing from him more definite than the above, nor would he even hint at the nature of the other topics which the Persian Government wish to bring forward. The impression produced on me was that the Government’s attitude towards the two Powers was slightly less favourable than a fortnight previously. There is nothing surprising in this, for it cannot be expected that a heterogeneous Cabinet such as the present, with little internal cohesion and divided on questions of external policy, should for long preserve a constant attitude in its relations towards us ; hut I fear that a more immediate cause is to be found in the three incidents which I have the honour to report in another despatch of this date, and that although the Ministers themselves may recognise that direct responsibility for these unfortunate occurrences cannot properly be laid at the door of the Russian Government public opinion will and does take quite a different view, and the Govern ment will not be strong enough to act in defiance of it. In these circumstances, I am inclined to believe that it may require some little time before the Government will think it opportune to approach the two Powers with a view to obtaining the financial assistance of which the country is in so urgent need. M. Poklewski, I admit, is not of this opinion, as he has had several occasions recently of seeing the Minister of Finance, who has intimated that the Government must have recourse to the assistance of the two Powers at an early date. M. Poklewski, perhaps, hardly makes sufficient allowance for the strength of popular feeling which the recent incidents have aroused, and I think that to some extent also the wish is father to the thought, as he is convinced that our common interests make it desirable that the Persian Government should be brought to recognise that they can look only to the British and Russian Governments, and nowhere else, for monetary aid. While I am disposed to agree generally with this view, it occurs to me that the acceptance by the Persian Government of the views of the two Powers on the subject of external financial operations by Persia, as expressed in the joint note of the 7th April has very much diminished the necessity of preventing the Persian Government from borrowing except from them, and I submit that there is no valid reason why, m the event of the Persian Government showing reluctance to apply to the two Powers for an advance, we should not allow them to obtain it from another quarter, unobjec tionable on political grounds, such for instance as the financial group now represented in Tehran by Mr. Preece. • i ; t x ± + The contingency which I foresee may of course not arise, but I venture to suggest that it is worth while ascertaining whether, in case it should occur, the Kussian Government would see any objection to Mr. Preece’s approaching the Persian Government with the proposals of his syndicate for an advance. From what I can learn, the straits of the Persian Government for money are such that the 400,0001. which the Strathcona Syndicate propose to advance will be a mere “drop in the bucket,” and it will not be long before the Government would be again looking for financial assistance, and they would then be forced to apply to the two Governments.

A With reference to ray letter of the 16th instant relative to the expected renewal hy the Persian Gov ernment of their request for financial assistance fro. His Majesty's and the Russian Governments, I am di rected by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copies of telegraphic correspondence which he has recently exchanged with His Majesty's \ Charges d*Affaires at St. Petersburg and Tehran on the subject. It will be perceived that the Russian Minister of Finance, though opposed to the proposal in princi ple, is v/illing to sanction it provided that suffi cient security is forthcoming for the repayment of the sum advanced and that he considers that this con dition would be fulfilled if the whole of the revenue of The Under Secretary of State, India Office.( 22188 / 10 ). of the Persian customs were pledged to the service of the advance as a v/hole and not the revenue of the northern customs to that of the Russian share exclusive -ly while the southern customs were reserved for the British share of the advance. Monsieur Kokovtsoff makes the further stipulation that a recent proposal of the Persian Government for the free admission of silver for minting purposes, whereby the revenue of the northern customs would he seriously diminished,should he dropped. As regards the former point, it will he seen that Mr. Marling has no objection to offer to the proposal and I am to state that Sir E. Grey is disposed, with Viscount Morley's concurrence, to accede to it. In this connexion I am to observe firstly, that neither in the negotiations between His Majesty's and the Russian Governments which took place when the question of a joint advance to the Persian Government was discussed early in the present year nor in the joint note handed to the Persian Government by the Representatives(22188/10) Representatlvee of the two Powers at Tehran on Fehru- : ') ary 16th, laying down the conditions on which the two Powers were willing to make the lean, was mention made of the arrangement which Monsieur Kokovtsoff as sumes to exist for the hypothecation of the northern and southern customs revenues to the service of the Russian and British shares of the advance respective ly, so that acquiescence in the present proposal in volves no modification of any formal existing arrange ment: and, secondly, that Article V of the Anglo- Russian Arrangement of August 31st, 1907 concerning Persia appears to provide means of collecting the sum due in case of default on the part of the Persian Government. As regards the proposal of the Persian Government for the admission of silver for minting purposes free ]L L * # ft a im&amp;Ah, rwor*- of customs duty, I am to observe that at present the i Persian exchequer loBee nothing by the payment of A ^ ' this duty, since that payment is made by one depart- 'Jt m 1 ^- ; ' ment of the administration to another. It would ^ ^ tuorsfore Uv /foj J Am /f-x yrs* - 1 / 4 ' • f(22188/10). therefore gain nothing by the remission of the duty, t is onlj effect of which would be seriously to dimin ish the revenue of the northern customs and, conse quently, the amount of security which they can afford. Sir E. Grey is accordingly disposed, should Lord Morley see no objection, to inform the Russian Govern ment that His Majesty's Government wall support them in their opposition to this proposal and he would further agree to the suggestion that the moment for informing the Persian Government that the two Powers are willing to make the advance should be left to the discretion of their Representatives on the spot. As regards the proposal of the Russian Minister at Tehran to his Government, reported in Mr. Marling's telegram No. 258 of June 20th, that the 'quasi-fixed” Re charges on the customs revenues (which are enunerated in detail in Sir G. Barclay's despatch No. 200 of sy 1909) should be made permanent, I am to state that, after consultation with Sir G. Barclay, who is at present on leave of absence in this country. Sir( 22188 / 10 ). Sir E. Grey is cf opinion that His Majesty’s Govern ment may safely agree provided that the debts of the Pei Sian Government to them and to the Imperial Bank of Persia are treated as a prior lien.

I am to transmit to you herewith copy of a tele gram f±om Mr. Marling, reporting the reasons for which, in his opinion, the expected application of the Persian Government is being delayed and express ing the view that, if the two Powers wish to con vince Persia of their desire to assist her, they should reduce the rate of interest to be demanded for the advance from Seven to Five per cent, the rate borne, it will be remembered, by the Anglo-Indian loans of 1903 and 1904.

He continues to maintain an attitude of complete reserve as to his proceedings, and I am rather disposed to think that he is merely waiting to see if anything will turn up. The idea of selling the Crown jewels has apparently been shelved for the present, and an attempt is being made to raise an internal loan of 1,000,000Z. at 7 per cent, on the security of the Crown domains, which are said to bring in 100,000L per annum. A similar attempt, made during the session of the first Assembly, proved a conspicuous lailure, and though there are some who are less sceptical than I as to the outcome of the present attempt, there cannot be any doubt as to the difficulties which the promoters of this scheme will have to overcome. The recommendations of the committee of the Medjliss appointed to examine the question are as follows :— That the proceeds of the loan should be devoted to organisation and reform on lines to be approved by the House. 2. That a committee should be elected composed of members of the House and others for this purpose. Foreign officials might be engaged to form part of this committee or board. 3. That the amount of revenue from Crown lands should be ascertained, and that provision should be made from this source for the amortisation of the capital and payment of the interest on the loan. Should the aforesaid revenue prove insufficient, any deficit to be made good from the passport receipts. The committee further recommenSea that loan coupons should be accepted in settlement of amounts due on account of revenue. 4. That the distribution of the bonds and collection of subscriptions throughout the country should be entrusted to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and that subscribers should everywhere make their applications and payments to the local branch or agency of the bank. 5. That a European official should be engaged from abroad as a financial expert to supervise and control the repayment of principal and interest, and to administer the xesources assigned for this purpose. [2781 /— 6 ] 1 COPY TO INDIA i 3 ,I 2 Various rates of interest, from 5 per cent, to 9 per cent., had been proposed, but the committee recommended the adoption of 7 per cent., and that the period should be for twenty years, and that the issue should amount to 5,000,000 tomans, in bonds of'' 10 tomans each.

Mr. Osborne, who hitherto had made no mention of the real object of his visit to Persia and had pretended it was for purposes of sport, was at first somewhat reticent, but later on in the course of conversation stated that his group, consisting of well known financiers, contained no single German, and inveighed bitterly against that nationality. In his opinion (or in that of his group) the situation was this : — The Persian Government needed money and money they would have. If the two Governments refused it, where was it to come from ? Either from the Germans he expressly emphasised the fact that he meant financiers nominally beyond the control of the German Government—or from his group. The Germans had nearly been successful lately on Lake Urumia, and in another two months’ time would probably succeed here if his group were not able to anticipate them by stepping in as soon as the negotiations with the two Governments had failed completely.

(Piivate and Confidential.) Marlborough Chambers, Jermyn Street, ^ ir&gt; _ London, May 25, 1910. I HAVE ^previously to this had the honour to make several communications to the Foreign Office, but without any very successful result. I now have the honour of laying this communication before you as head of the corps diplomatique anglais, this body being the channel of communication with all foreign Powers; the ultimate results of such communications are attained by the practical application of British individual enterprise and commerce. It seems to me that the existing opposition or apparent opposition with which my proposals and suggestions have met can only have arisen by failure to understand their exact aim and ultimate purpose, the aim and object of which are to revive British prestige in Persia, and to enable British trade and commerce to successfully compete with that of other Powers establishing the same in a supreme position. The chief competitor is Russia, but without in any way prejudicing our friendly relations, I am sure that it will be possible to take such steps, although Russia may strongly oppose them, her efforts having in past years been exerted to cripple British trade, of which the annulment of article 59 of the Treaty of Berlin so far as it relates thereto, and the Russo-Persian Convention of 1901, whereby the Persian Customs tariffs were revised in favour of Russia, are only two striking examples among many such incidents. The present position of Persia is such as to enable the aims, desires, and objectives of Russia to be accomplished most easily ; in fact, the advacement of this Power is almost overlooked and ignored by us, and proposals that would counteract such advancement are diplomatically opposed. Russia has her influence in the north, including the capital of the country. She protects and stimulates her trade, and furthermore the northern trade routes by which her trade is carried are more under the control and influence of the Persian Government than the southern trade routes. As long as the present state of affairs is maintained, namely, that the Persian Government is just able to carry on the affairs of the nation, and is constantly harassed by representations that prevent it from devoting its time to the internal reorganisation of the country, so long will British trade and prestige continue to decrease to the advantage and gain of Russia. It therefore follows that Russia has nothing to gain, but much to lose by the Persian Government being firmly established on a sound financial basis, which would enable her to take those steps which are necessary for the suppression of any brigandage there may be on the southern trade routes. The Persian Government is not alone responsible for these results, but it is partly, I may say solely due to the British diplomatic policy adopted in Persia, the history of which in recent years has been a succession of results that have lowered the British [2741 dd —5] O' C' D v ^ TO m r-1 \ i . tv j / \ RETARYT M v-t.nation in the eyes of the whole Mahommedan race, a large portion of which we already govern and by which race Persia is looked upon as their redeeming country. At the same time the said policy has formed a barrier to British advancement and trade, affording protection to others against British competition, allowing other competitors almost to monopolise the trade and prestige in the country. I ask is there no one for the sake of the Empire whose honour and progress they have in their keeping who will put their shoulder to the wheel for the advancement of a practical issue instead of their back against a wall which prevents our advancement and covers that of others ? It is surprising the indifference with which Bussia’s advance in Northern Persia is looked upon in comparison with the absolute standstill I might say, decline in the south, by Great Britain, I am told “it is to be expected.” I submit we ought to do everything in our power to arrest or counteract this state of affairs. And in dealing with Bussia in this matter, while always maintaining our friendly relations, still keep well in view the aims and objectives Bussia has had for the last 100 years. The programme I propose should be carried out would place Great Britain and British interests in a supreme position and gain the gratitude and loyal support of the entire Persian nation, at the same time attaining the object of the Anglo-Bussian Convention of 1903, namely, the absolute independence and integrity of Persia, thereby making that country a “ buffer ” State to India, It is regrettable that the delays which have already occurred have taken place for had it not been made impossible to carry out these ideas three months ago, all complications, if any, with Germany would have been avoided, as negotiations were in such a position that the Persian Government would not have considered or listened to any suggestions from that quarter, rendering it useless for any other representative to investigate and consider the economic and commercial development of Persia. It now remains for the British nation to support such schemes as will accomplish this end, or the history of 1898 to 1903 will be repeated with still more disastrous results. I humbly suggest that with proper support diplomatically given, the aims and objects I have had the honour of submitting to you confidentially can be attained and in the end when it is a fait accompli will strengthen our friendly relations with the other Powers. Delay is dangerous, even a day’s delay. I anxiously await your reply. I have, &amp;c. JOSEPH WOOLF,J ™ s Docamerlt is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Goy P .r r,n^,«-1 \? PERSIA.

The scheme originally adopted for the Liquidation of the Anglo-Indian advance to Persia has now been superseded by the new arrangement, under which the Bank of Persia will re ceive the Customs revenue of the Gulf Ports and will pay over to the Government of India interest on the outstanding amount of the loan and its arrears from the 21st March last, and annual instalments of the capital from 1913 to 1928.

In case this is so, it may be well that I should mention to you that I understand that our Auditor thinks it his duty to draw attention in his Report on the India Office Accounts for 1908- 09 to the fact that the payments of interest and year in respect of the loan, were not actually made to uso In accordance with 21 and 22 Vic: Cap. 106, Sections 52 and 53, the Auditor's Report will be presented as soon as Parliament meets again.

Yours dc. (Sd.) O.HJ8 i ri 2-JJ- IHDIA OFFICE, S.W. 18th May 1910. Dear Sir G-eorae. s I* your letter of the 17th. The new arrangements regarding the Persian loan provide for an annuity sufficient to repay not only the original debt but the additions that have accrued owing to the successive defaults of the Persian Government, so that we shall not in the ordinary course ask you for anything until the next default occurs; at the same time we should like to have from the Treasury or the Foreign Office an official intimation of the willingness of the Imperial Government to accept and carry out some suitable plan for making good to us, on occasion arising, its guarantee against half of any loss occurring through the loan. We do not regard with any excessive affection the particular plan which we sent officially to the Foreign Office in 1908, and we smould be glad to amena it wherever it may seem to need amending. But we have really been embarrassed by the failure of the foreign Office i r G.H. Liu rray, G.C.B., Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W.Office to give any reply whatever to the letter in which our plan was forwarded: and I hope that you will now authorise that Office to move in the matter. 2 . I take the opportunity of reminding you that you thought at one time of proposing that half the amount due from Persia to us on account of the loan should be paid to us by the Treasury, which would then receive half the annuity, and I sent you unofficially a llemoran&amp;um on the method of carrying out that idea. This is, of course, an entirely different question from the one dealt with in the official correspondence mentioned in paragraph 1 above. Do you think of pursuing it? Personally, I hope that you will. But we have, of course, no right, under existing agreements, to ask you to do so. It is for you to take the initiative, and for us to welcome it. 3. The figure (&lt;£314.281.16.4.) mentioned in your letter was verified by us. If you would line the calculations, we will send them to you. 4. . Forgive my excessively methodical style.

The interest on the loans is to be paid monthly out o the customs receipts encashed by the bank, and the capital is to be repaid yearly in fifteen instalments. The Imperial Bank of Persia will hand over to the Persian Government the suiplus remaining over when these obligations have been met. u oal* 111 ^ Parcla y ® telegram No. 180 and Mr. Mailing’s telegram No. 185 of the dOth and Mst instant it will be seen that the Persian Government, in view of the inclusion of the Anglo-Indian advances of 1903 and 1904 in the amalgamation scheme, expected, or, rather, expressed a strong desire, that His Majesty’s Government should surrender their lien on the Caspian Sea Fisheries and the revenues of the Posts and lelegiaphs, which constitute part of the security of the Government advances of 1903 and 1904. It was considered most undesirable that this lien should be surrendered, and the desire of the Persian Government in this matter has not been acceded to. In order, however, not to imperil the success of the bank’s negotiations, and as it was most desirable that the Anglo-Indian advances should be included in the amalgamation scheme, according to which the payments of interest are to be made monthly, it was suggested at a conference of representatives of the India Office, of the bank, and of this department that it might be advisable to offer to the Persian Government to postpone the repayment of the capital of the Government advances. The India Office thought that this would be advantageous, and the bank were authorised to inform their manager at Tehran that Sir E. Grey would recommend the proposal to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to point out to you that a successful conclusion of the negotiations in the form of an agreement on the lines indicated above cannot but conduce to the advantage both of the Imperial and Indian Governments and of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Not only would the customs receipts of Mohammerah and Ahwaz be explicitly included in the securities pledged by the Persian Govern ment—a point upon which no adequate assurances have hitherto been received from the Persian Government— but also satisfactory provision would be made for the punctual payment of interest and repayment of capital of the Government and bank loans. In the case of the bank, the advantages of a successful conclusion of the negotiation are even greater, there being a prospect, once an agreement is reached, that the Persian Government will give all their banking business to that institution, thus making it virtually a State bank, and that they will make further valuable concessions in the matter of the issue of bank notes. Sir Edward Grey is accordingly Not printed.

I am to express Sir E.

In conclusion, I am to request that Lord Morley will be so good as to cause a calculation to be made in your Department of the total debt of the Persian Gov ernment in respect of the Anglo-Indian loans and of the amount of the annual instalments, in order to control the figures supplied by the Bank, in accordance with the desire expressed in Mr. Marling*s telegram No. 195 of the 28th ultimo.

I BEG to enclose copies of the telegrams exchanged with you on the subject of the amalgamation of Persian Government debts. The basis of the whole arrangement is the binding hypothecation to the bank exclusively of the entire customs’ revenues of all the Persian Gulf ports, including revenues in excess of the sums monthly required to meet these obligations, and that any receipts thereafter will be held by the bank entirely at the disposal of the Persian Government themselves to deal with as they desire. It is important that the entire revenues should be hypothecated to the redemption of these long outstanding debts, and not only the revenues of one or two specially named ports which might appear to offer sufficient security, but, through unforeseen circumstances, might fall short of any one monthly payment, and thereby create complications ; moreover, the directors think that such an hypothecation is in itself a safeguard for the undertaking given by the existing Cabinet, should pressure be brought upon their successors to modify the solemn engagement now given by them. As ail the telegrams exchanged with you on this subject have been communicated to the Foreign Office, and have had their approval, the directors not unreasonably expect that His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran PERSIA.

I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you the enclosed copy of a letter from the India Office,* setting forth the exact priority of the claims on the southern customs of Persia of the various advances and loans made to the Persian Government from time to time by the Imperial Bank of Persia and by the Imperial and Indian Governments. Subject to your acceptance of the principles laid down in this letter from the India Office, I am to state that Sir Edward Grey is willing to issue instructions to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in the sense desired by you.

[12124J (No. 44.) Sir, No. 1. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 11.) v ^ / ei7'n? 0 Tehran, March 24, 1910. WITH reference to my telegram No. 83 of the 26th February and to yours No. 42 of the 2nd March, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of the agreement concluded between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank on the 9th instant, which gives the bank a mint monopoly for one year. Technically, the Persian Government reserve to themselves “ the entire monopoly of importing silver for coinage by the Imperial Mint,” but as they have not the necessary capital available for the purpose, they appoint the Imperial Bank “ sole agents for the purchase of such silver,” and the bank agrees to provide 200,000/'. for this object, which is to be repaid as the silver is coined. It is calculated by the bank manager that, if the whole 60,000,000 miscals of silver (say, 1,000,000/. worth) is imported in the year, the Persian Government’s approximate profit should be from 15 to 20 per cent., or, say, 150,000/. to 200,000/. The advance of 200,000/. is, of course, not an advance to the Persian Government, as at no time will it be at their disposal; but the bank has agreed to give the Persian Government in advance, “ should the necessity arise, the approximate profit accruing on each parcel of silver sent to the mint.” This in practice will only amount to the placing at the disposal of the Persian Government, perhaps a fortnight in advance, the sums due to them by the bank on account of their profit. The advantage to the Government lays in the fact that they are dealing with an honest institution, and will be certain of obtaining direct a handsome profit out of the mint, instead of, as formerly, leaving it m the hands of a native farmer, and obtaining only as much as could be squeezed out of him. . . Besides the 9 per cent, interest on advances and the per cent, commission on the value of the silver imported, the bank will have the immense advantage of being the sole holders of krans, and thereby being able to dictate their own terms in the matter of purchasing any bills on Europe which may be offered either for the purpose of a foreign loan to the Persian Government or in the ordinary course of commerce, and the bank 7 is to be congratulated on having secured so advantageous a business. ^ Politically the agreement is an object lesson in the manner in which a financial arrangement with such far-reaching effects can be concluded secretly, speedily and without the official cognisance of the Medjljss. The negotiations were conducted by a deputy with the bank direct, and the legation was m no way brought mto the discussions, though Mr. Rogers laid the matter before me by order of his board of directors I felt obliged to inform you of the proposals by telegraph, so as to give you an opportunity of expressing your views as to whether the arrangement should be concluded without consulting the Russian Government; but having regard to your decision not to interfere in the matter, I have not mentioned it to my Russian collea g ue ‘ I have, &amp;c.

Agreement between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank of Persia. s - Agreement made between the Imperial Bank of Persia on the one part and His Imneriaf Maiestv the Shah of Persia’s Government on the other part bv which the Imperial Bank of Persia undertakes to buy bar silver for account of His Majesty s Government and for shipment to Persia for the purpose of coinage by the Imperial Mint, upon the following conditions : THIS agreement shall be in force for the period of one year, from the 21st March, )10, until the 21st March, 1911. [2703 /— 6 ] COPY TO iJ 2. The Persian Government having reserved to itself the exclusive monopoly of importing silver for coinage by the Imperial Mint, the Imperial Bank of Persia is hereby appointed sole agent for the purchase of such silver for account of the Persian Govern ment and for the forwarding of the same to Tehran, and the Persian Government binds itself not to import any silver whatever through the agency of any other party, but solely through the Imperial Bank of Persia, and^ not to purchase silver imported by any other party during the period for which this agreement remains in force. The Persian Government agrees to pay all expenses covering the purchase of the silver and its transit to Tehran, including insurance, &amp;c., incurred by the Imperial Bank of Persia on account of the Persian Government, as set forth in article 8. 3. The Persian Government binds itself to purchase exclusively from the Imperial Bank of Persia all foreign exchange for the importation of the silver in question. 4. The rate for the purchase of all such exchange is fixed upon the basis of J per cent, above the buying rate of the Imperial Bank of Persia for telegraphic transfers on London. The price at which the silver is to be purchased shall be determined simultaneously with the fixing of the rate of exchange. 5. The amount of silver to be imported under the terms of this agreement is to be 60,000,000 miscals, but it is understood that should it not be profitable, on account of the rate of exchange and the price of silver, to import this amount, it will not be binding on either side to import under such conditions. 6. The Persian Government agrees to pay the Imperial Bank of Persia a commission of l per cent, on the value of all bar silver imported during the period of this agree ment, this commission to be calculated on the sterling cost of the silver payable in krans at the same rate for sterling as fixed for each parcel of silver purchased. 7. The Imperial Bank of Persia agrees to provide such sums as shall be required from time to time for the purchase of bar silver to the extent of 200,000Z., of which the equivalent is to be repaid as the silver is coined by the Imperial Mint. Interest on all such advances to be at the rate of 9 per cent, per annum. 8. All silver en route to Tehran, in the bank, and at the mint during the process of coinage and otherwise will remain under hypothecation to the Imperial Bank of Persia as security for the sums advanced. It is agreed that, should the necessity arise, the approximate profit accruing to the Persian Government on each parcel of silver sent to the mint is to be held at their disposal from time to time in advance, full provision, however, being allowed for the refund of the cost of such silver, with the charges and interest thereon, to the Imperial Bank of Persia. It is also agreed that the amount of silver necessary to be at the mint at any one time in order to keep the machinery fully employed is considered to be about 50,000L Done in duplicate, Tehran, the 9th March, 1910.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, 1 PERSIA.

' I MAY L, the honour to acknowledge yonr letter of the 8th instant, only received this coming the contents of which were duly verbally communicated to the Board. With reference to your remark that— • . !: ' S j° f course understood that the bank guarantees the regular payment of the interest and sinking fund of the Anglo-Indian advances of 1903 and 1904, as well as that or such arrears as are already due on this account.” u 1 am instructed to state that my directors regret that they are unable to give the guarantees mentioned. They rather reply upon the support of His Majesty’s Government to further British interests by enforcing the carrying into effect of any undertaking that may finally be agreed upon with the Persian Government. I beg to enclose copy of a memorandum, left with the directors, of the purport of a verbal communication made by Sir George ^Mackenzie at the Foreign Office yesterday, which correctly states the present position as understood by the directors of the Bank of Persia, who will be pleased to receive the revenues of the southern customs as therein mentioned, and to allocate same as may properly be applicable to the redemption of the Anglo-Indian loan. I have, &amp;c. G. NEWELL, Manager. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Explanation given to Mr. Mallet and Mr, Maxwell at interview at Foreign Office, April 15, 1910. ON calling at the Foreign Office last night I found that a telegram had been received from Sir George Barclay, stating that some misunderstanding seemed to exist regarding the payment of the Government loan incorporated in the debt due to the bank. I explained that the misunderstanding appeared to have arisen on the telegram dispatched by the bank on the 8th instant, with the object of making it quite clear to the manager at Tehran that in settlement with the Persian Government the debt due under the Anglo-Indian loan (about 300,000?.) was to be added to the debt due to the bank (about 600,000?.) in accordance with the verbal undertaking given by me personally to Mr. Mallet on that date. It appeared to the directors that the subsequent telegram of the 13th, received from Tehran, stating that the Persian Government desired to modify the terms at first proposed (viz., monthly payments of interest at 7 per cent, and capital on the entire debt) was at variance with the original terms of the Anglo-Indian Agreement (i.e., 5 per cent, interest and payment of capital by twenty yearly instalments) and availed of to put forward the fresh proposal. I pointed out, to obviate any misunderstanding—and not to give the Persians a loophole for changing the basis of their original proposal—that the telegram of the 8th was dispatched to make the matter quite clear, and I explained that my under standing of the settlement as it now stands, if accepted by the Persian Government, is as follows :— The bank to receive the exclusive collection of all the southern customs, and therefrom to deduct monthly the interest and capital due over fifteen years, handing over to the Persian Government any surplus thereafter, it being made clear to the Persian Government that the end of the first year (the 21st March, 1911) they would have to pay an additional 5 per cent, interest on the Anglo-Indian debt, and one-twentieth part [2703 s—3]April 16, 1910 of the capital of same. In default of their so doing the hank to add the interest and capital due under the Anglo-Indian Agreement to the monthly collection payable to the bank, treating as surplus anything remaining thereafter. This appears to me the proper way of treating the matter in the event of the Persian Government raising any objection to alteration in the terms of the Anglo- Indian Agreement. I hope this is correct and clearl\ understood. I understand a telegram was sent to Sir George Barclay, explaining the matter to him in the above sense. • G. S. M. - , ■ 1 4 m! • •• C f PERSIA .

G. NE \\ ELL, Manager. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from a Letter from the Deputy Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia 1 c/mm, to the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, London, dated March 28 lylu. Persian Government Debts .—I confirm the telegram sent to you on the 21st instant,^ putting forward the Persian Governments proposals for the consolidation and conversion of these accounts. It is needless for me to say that the thoroughness of the scheme as placed before us on Sunday afternoon by the Vakil-ul-Royah caused us some surprise, in view of the previous attitude toward such matters in times gone by ; it tends to illustiate the change that is rapidly taking place m the reorganisation and the management of the country’s affairs, and it seems to me that the time is at hand for the bank to feel the possibility of working closer in touch with the Government (for which they have on several occasions expressed their desire) and where possible to o-ive ad anta &amp; es in exchange for its good-will, sympathy, and support, which the board will recognise is invaluable to us if the success we may reasonably expect is to be achieved. _ In considering the two proposals there is in each the alternative, for the board to decide, whether it is advisable to convert the majority of the capital employed in Persia into sterling and thus eliminate much of our exchange risk, or retain the loan in currency carrying an additional 1 per cent, interest. In the first proposal, although the security is good, and sufficient guarantee for the payment of interest and amortisation, there exists the possibility that in the event of its being necessary to come upon the Government for additional security, the remaining Gulf ports indicated should be pledged elsewhere in the meantime, althouoh at the moment this does not appear to be at all likely. The second proposal is therefore the more attractive, and this the board will no doubt favour. It carries 1 per cent, more interest, and the security is superior to that we already hold for these advances, in so far as it is laid down now that the customs receipts of all the Gulf ports are to be paid into the bank. That the Persian Govern ment should offer better terms as to security and interest for. the option of paying off the loan at the end of any three years tends to show their confidence in their ability to redeem the debt within a shorter time than the thirty years specified. The repayment of the loan and release of our locked-up capital at no distant date appeals strongly to us, as we feel confident that should the Persian Government be successful in carrying out the contemplated economic and administrative reforms, a general development in all classes of trade and enterprise will follow, in which the bank’s capital will no doubt find ready and profitable employment. With regard to the means to be employed to repay all loans possible, contracted with the Banque d’Escompte by sale of jewels and other realisable objects, I may mention that we observe great determination to carry this through, and, when mentioning the possibility of an internal loan being offered for subscription in the near future, I had no idea the scheme was so closely connected with the object now disclosed. You probablv remarked the prompt way in which the details of the mint contract were [2703 i—2]n i concluded, and have also noted the efforts the Persian Government have made to keep “ interest payments to us-this is not so in the case of the Banque d Eseompte-and “n other minor matters displayed their good-will towards us - we are therefore inclined to 1 , 7 • . + nrnmise mven to place all Government business m our ' Ci h rs. * *? have done sav a year Jo. I think I am right in saying that, apart from any desire the Persian Government may have to obtain advantages by the acceptance of the present proposals, they are well able to see the benefat of doing the most of their business with us, iu whom they can place conhaence. The matter of our Government debts has taken a turn suddenly but it was not unlocked for, as, under any scheme of further borrowing, we should have had to con template being paid off or accepting a share for our released funds in a o or 6 per cent loan consolidating the existing debts. The Persian Government are sanguine of success iu floating an internal loan on the security ot new axes on salt, by winch the Russian advances will be paid off as far as conditions will allov ; and it v as thought to avoid inconvenience to us, that the suggestion to pay us off gradually was made The proposal to increase our note concession limit by 400,0001. is one that the Persian Government are quite of opinion will be of great benefit to us in the near future-that mav be so, but it will depend entirely upon circumstances. ’ r i r ‘ Credit fcwier de Perse.-M. Bizot left here last week for three months furlough, and during his absence it is to be decided whether he returns in the service o. the Persian Government or not. He was speaking strongly m favour of a scheme for the establishment of a land bank, such as exists in Egypt, by which the advances on Government lands and those estates at present remamnig unproductive m the hands et the debtors of the two banks could be taken over, and the properties administered to better advantage. M. Bizot is of opinion that the scheme is one tnat should command the serious attention of the parties most interested in securing such advantages in Persia as at present offer before German enterprise and capital step m. He tells me he has mentioned this matter to both the English and Russian Ministers, and it is at his special request that I pass the suggestion on to yon.IIhilDggBS!£ii! the Propert y of His Britannic Majes ty’s Government.} a PERSIA.

PERSIA. ^ [March 10.] Section 1, [7148] No. 1. (No. 36.) Sir, Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Foreign Office, March 10, 1910. WITH reference to your telegram No. 83 of the 26th ultimo relative to the pro posed arrangement between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank of Persia regarding the importation of silver for coinage, I have to inform you that Sir T. Jackson and Sir G. Mackenzie called at this Office on the 25th. and communicated to Mr. Mallet certain papers referring to this subject, of which copies are enclosed.* It will be observed that the bank have obtained from the Persian Government permission to coin about 160,000Z. worth of silver ; that the Government intend in future not to grant any more mint contracts, but are ready to appoint the bank to be their agents for the purchase of silver for their account ; and that the directors of the bank have approved this proposal, which is advantageous to both parties, and is described as an important and far-reaching commercial transaction The Persian Government have also offered the bank the option of purchasing the Crown jewels, but this offer the directors have declined on commercial grounds. The local representatives of the bank consider that if the jewels were thus sold the Persian Government would decline the proposed Anglo-Russian advance of 400,000Z. You will also notice that the Persian Government have paid interest on the bank’s loans to the amount of 1,900,000 kransT 1 ^ ^ As regards the question raised in your telegram of communicating with the Russian Government on the subject, I do not think that His Majesty’s Government need take the initiative, in view of the fact that the Imperial Bank alone occupies in Persia the position of a State bank, and the contract is only for one year. If objection is raised by the Russian Government it will perhaps be possible to find some solution on the expiry of the contract. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.

Sir, 25, Abchurch Lane, London, March 8, 1910. WITH reference to your enquiry by telephone this afternoon regarding interest on the Persian Government debt to the bank, I have the honour to enclose an extract from a confidential letter,* dated the 12th February, received from our Tehran office on the 5th instant, from which you will see how. the payments for interest stood at the date of the letter, the 12th February. The sum mentioned in the Tehran letter, 149,826 tomans, has, according to a telegram from Tehran on the 24th February, been increased to 190,000 tomans. I am, &amp;c. G. NEWELL, Manager. [2668 i—3] ♦Not printed.[This Document is the Property of His Brita/nic Majesty’s Government,! PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [7148] Papers communicated by Sir T. Jackson and Sir G. Mackenzie February 25, 1910. a-) Extract from Confidential Letter from the Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran, to the Imperial Bank of Persia, London, dated December 22, 1909. I AM glad to say that we have obtained our contract without having to ask for the intervention of the legation. Permission has at last been given for the coinage of 20,000,000 miscals of silver, half of which (about 160,0002.) being allotted to us; deliveries of 10,000 taels per diem have been arranged for—half the daily outturn of the mint—so I think we.can say, in this instance, that the Persian Government has treated us well. As soon as the present 20.000,000 miscals has been coined, which should take place about four months, the Persian Government has the intention to discontinue granting mint contracts to the public, and will in future undertake the importation of silver for its own account. It is generally admitted that the mint must continue to work owing to the steady drain of coin to which this country is peculiarly subjected ; forming as it does the supply centre of silver currency for the Mussulman population of Transcaspia and Central Asia. I should like to have the Board’s views upon a proposal made to us by a member of the Finance Committee, that the bank should act as agents for the Persian Govern ment in this matter, viz., to buy reasonable parcels of sil ver for account of the Persian Government to supply the mint, the exchange for its purchases being bought from us on credit, the rate for silver and exchange being fixed simultaneously, thus' the Persian Government would have their operation covered, and our sale of sterling would be no greater risk in exchange than we accept at present in the ordinary way of business. All charges for freight, insurance, brokerage, out of pocket expenses, and our com mission to be paid by the Persian Government. The silver would be consigned to us and be under our control until the sterling paid out in London had been refunded to' us in equivalent silver coined by the mint. It would mean a floating advance of say 50,0002. to the Persian Government at say 12 per cent, or 9 per cent, per annum secured by silver in our hands. It is estimated that 1,000,0002. of silver passes through the mint during the course of the year, it working at the rate of 100,000 tomans per week, the present output being as much as 120,000 tomans per week ; this, however, would be controlled by the price of silver and the cover obtainable for our sales of sterling to the Persian Government. The proposal is advantageous both to us and the Persian Government and is far reaching and important; it is a commercial transaction of a simple nature, and we are provided with ample cover for our advance. Having the exclusive outturn from the mint flowing regularly into our treasury constitutes for us the control of the money market and a recuperative source for our note reserve. The stoppage of indiscriminate importation of silver by the public for minting purposes would tend to keep exchange on a steady level and permit us, with the command of money judiciously wielded, to cover our sales to the Persian Government upon a quiet and even market; the competition for exchange on the part of importers of silver—our chief competitors—would become a negligable quantity. There is the large and increasing trade on the southern shores of the Caspian and in Baku to finance, which is only possible by consignments of actual coin from Tehran ; I give you the figures for the month of November obtained from the post office representing cash sent from here by post, including the sum sent by the bank of 236.000 tomans, by the public 237,000 tomans, and not including our caravans of 220.000 tomans to .Meshed and Tabreez ; this illustrates the large demand for coin at the tail end of the season. It must be remembered that practically the whole of the Resht silk trade is financed by remittances of coin from Tehran, which shows the immense advantage to us of having command of coin from the mint. [2629 66—3]Although Trader this arrangement we should no^lontrer be importers of silver on our own account, we are inclined to think that the additional business hat would accrue to us fully compensates for the loss of profit on si ver and consolidates our position as a dominating factor in the trade and finance or the conn ry. ., rf I have no hesitation in recommending the proposal for the favourable considera-ff tion of the Board; there is a possible objection to making advances to the mint but in the event of contingencies we have a lien upon the silver which would covei all possible risk in this respect, and in that case leave the profit upon its importation in our hands. ( 2 -) Translation of Telegram received from Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran, February 24, 1910. Subject to your approval, we have a draft agreement with the mint (referred to m our private letter of the 22nd December) ready. Terms of agreement are for one year, amount is 6,000,000 tomans ; i per cent, commission and 9 per cent, interest. Persian Government bind themselves to import bar silver exclusively through us and to buy exchange on London exclusively from us at f per cent, above our buying rate. ersian Government undertake not to grant mint contract to any other party ; the hypothecation of the bar silver in transit and at mint will be the security for our advance; bank will allow Persian Government the approximate profit on the silver as minted ; all charges to be for their account. . i j -xi -d Persian Government anxious we should redeem jewels pledged with Banque d’Escompte de Perse for 1,600,000 krans and accrued interest 300 000 krans, and take over the advance for one year at 9 per cent, interest, making 1,900,000 krans, with a view to ultimate sale through us. Do you approve ? • -i -i i t&gt; • Persian Government are favourably disposed to Imperial Bank °f Persia , the interest received from the 20th September to the present date is 1,900,000 krans, and we have every hope to receive more favourable consideration m the future.

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 24, 12'45 p.m.) (No. 129.) Tehran, March 24, 1910, 2 p.m. MY immediately preceding telegram. Proposals are doubtless outcome of a note to Persian Government, in which I asked for the unification of all the Government’s debts to the bank and the regular payment of interest. This note I presented, following example and with knowledge of the Russian Minister, who had just presented a communication similar though somewhat more pressing, because Russian Bank’s interest was in arrears. It would be thus difficult for me to conceal these proposals from my Russian colleague, and I am not certain how he would view them, for having regard to final paragraph of the bank manager’s* telegram to his head office (which, although strictly private, I presume you have seen) we may assume proposals similar to those made to our bank have not been made to his. As to the prospects of the Persian Government being able to wipe off its floating debt to the Russian Bank, I should mention that the French expert’s valuation of the Crown jewellery exceeds my expectations—his figure already, though he has not yet completed his examination, reaching 12,000,000 fr.—but I am sceptical about the ability of the Persian Government to raise much money internally.

The telegram enclosed in your letter is not altogether clear, especially as regards the second alternative. But as far as \ iscount Morley is able to judge there seems no reason for objecting on financial grounds to either proposal, provided that the prior hen of the British Government on the customs of the Gulf ports is preserved. It does not appear whether the scheme for repayment of the Russian loans is part of the second alternative or is common to both. If the former be the case, then the first alternative appears pieferable from the political point of view j since, with the Persian Government’s debt to Russia would disappear the power which the Russian Government at present possess of vetoing any loan from a third party. But perhaps the chance of the Persian Government’s being able to float a bond fide internal loan for the purpose of paying their debts to Russia is so remote that this point need not be taken into consideration. . Tn connection with these proposals, Lord Morley trusts that the desirability of taking steps to ensure more regular payment of the interest and sinking fund of His Majesty s Government s loans will not be overlooked when a suitable occasion arises. It will be remembered that this question was postponed by Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 112, dated the 26th March, 1909, to Sir G. Barclay. ^legrarn I am, &amp;c. E. S. MONTAGU.

Foreign Office to Imperial Bank of Persia. (Secret.) Sir, Foreign Office, February 19, 1910. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to refer to Sir Charles Hardinge’s letter of the 28th September, 1906, marked “ Secret,” relative to a joint advance of 400,000L, which it was at that time proposed that His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government should make to the Persian Government. Your directors are aware that the British share of this advance amounted to 200,0001., contributed in equal proportions by the Imperial and Indian exchequers, and that of this sum one-half of the former and the whole of the latter contribution (150,000L in all) were placed to the order of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in the Imperial Bank of Persia. They will further recollect that, as a result of further negotiations between His Majesty’s and the Russian Governments, the amount of the advance was never actually paid to the Persian Government, and that on the 5th September, 1907, the bank, at Sir E. Grey’s request, returned to the Treasury and India Office respectively the sums which they had contributed. It was, however, agreed by the two Governments at the time that the amount of the advance should be considered still to remain at the disposal of the Persian Govern ment, and it was on this understanding that the above-mentioned repayment was made. I am to inform you that recently this question has again formed the subject of an exchange of views between the two Governments, who have now informed the Persian Government that they are prepared to advance to them jointly a sum of 400,0001 Certain conditions will be imposed on the Persian Government in connection with this advance which will be devoted to the re-establishment of order in the country and to the introduction of certain pressing reforms in the administration, and the expendit e of which will be strictly controlled. As on the former occasion, His Majesty’s Government will contribute one-half of the sum advanced, which will once more be provided by the Imperial and Indian exchequers in equal shares and placed in the Imperial 1 ink of Persia to the order of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. If a larger loan is raised at any future time the repaviaent of this advance will be a first charge upon it, failing which it must be repaid in ten annual instalments together Avith 7 per cent, interest, both principal and interest being secured on the revenues of the Persian customs, with the profits of the Persian mint as a supplementary guarantee. „ , n . I am accordingly to request that, on the receipt of the above-mentioned sums of money, which, if the Persian Government accept the requisite conditions, will be sent to the’Imperial Bank of Persia from this department and the India Office, they may be placed with as little delay as possible to the order of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury are aware that the amount of this advance was never actually paid to the Persian Government, and that on the 5th September, 1907, the Imperial Bank of Persia, to which 50,000Z. had been paid as one- half of the Imperial, and 100,000L as the whole of the Indian contribution to the loan, returned those sums to the Treasury and India Office respectively. It was, however, agreed by the two Governments at the time that the amount of the advance should still be considered to remain at the disposal of the Persian Govern ment, and it was on this understanding that the above-mentioned repayment was made, as appears from Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 16th August, 1907, by which Sir E. Grey reserved to himself the right to request that the Imperial contribution to the advance might again be paid to the bank should circumstances render it advisable to complete the transaction. I am to state that such circumstances have, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey and the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, now arisen, and that they have decided, after a prolonged exchange of views, to comply with a request which they have received from the Persian Government by advancing to the latter jointly a sum of 400,000Z., to be devoted to the re-establishment of order in the country and the introduction of certain pressing reforms in the administration.

There is one point on which a few words of explanation are perhaps desirable, viz:- the race of interest that is mentioned in various parts of the ifmorandm. I have taker- r cent (net) throughout because this is the rate that under the is to ba obtained from the Persian Oovcrrmeni.

Tours sincerely,imtomim' for fir gforof 1. In April 1903 a loan of &lt;£300,000 was nada to the Persian Government through the Imperial Bank of Persia from money advanced by the In&lt; ia Office. The Persian Government was to pay the Imperial Pank interest at 5 per cent per annum, of which 1 per cent was to be retained by the Bank and 4 per cent to he paid to the India Office. His Majesty's Government accepted joint responsibility for the principal and interest, the responsibility taking the form of a guarantee to the Government of India against loss on the transaction to the extent of one half the amount involved. (See Foreign Office Letter to India Office dated 3rd April 1903 and Treasury letter to Foreign Office 15th November 1907). In March 1904 the interest due up to date on the loan was paid to the India Office together -with £10.000 towards repayment of principal. In September 1904 a further loan of £100.000 was made on the same conditions raising the total to £290.000: and it was agreed with the Persian Government that that Government should provide for interest and dischargethe third payment might be postponed for 6 months and this was agreed to* Subsequently they asked that the repayments of principal night be suspended for 3 years i.e. that in April 1907, 1903 a7id 1909 they should be allowed to pay interest only. This also iocs agreed to. The payment of interest due on 4th April 1907 wider this modified arrangement was made in February 1903 together with interest amounting to &lt;£596. 4. 2 on account of the delay. No further payment on account of either bt * interest or principal has since been made. ‘The total sum owing by the Persian Government on 4th April 1909, including interest on arrears of V. interest was thus as folloios:- Principal &lt;&gt;£290.000 less &lt;£17.979. 4. 5 As./yjj&amp;ee c&amp;jl s .*? . ‘t.

The proposed payment by the Treasury to the India Office would provide a suitable occasion for placing the relations between the various parties to the loan on a simpler footing than that on which they now are; and in order that advantage may he taken of this occasion I venture to make the following suggestions:- (A) I think that the agreement by which the loan of &lt;£890,000 was converted in 1904 into a terminable annuity payable by the Persian Government should be regarded, as is done in ohe calculations in the previous paragraph as having a default the strictly correct course is to calculate a new annuity - a course which cannot be X If the lapsed through that Government's default. lave been different. transactions with such a debtor as the Persian Government involves the possibility oj endless discussion and confusion. For on each occasion of takentaken without an agreement as to the period for which the new annuity is to run; and any settlement of this point on the occasion of any one default becomes useless or nearly so, when a further default, involving the calculation of yet another new annuity, occurs. An attempt to avoid this difficulty was made in the Memorandum dated 24th December 1907 (forwarded to the Foreign Office with India Office latter dated 12th February 1903), in which it was proposed to allow original annuity calculation to renain in force and to transfer all arrears of principal and interest to a separate arrears account* But this procedure viust necessarily hecorte nore unreal and unsatisfactory as the amount of arrears increases. The figures quoted above show that on April 1909 the arrears of interest (including suns due the Imperial Band) amounted to in addition there were arrears of principal amount ing to &lt;£30,432, making £53,364 in all, and in all probability there will be additional arrears on 4th April 1910 of about £25,000 (viz: £23,270 due on1 I on account of the annuity + 3* on &lt;£57,332). In subsequent years the arrears would probably crow faster, and, if future receipts were taken, as they should be, as ajjplicable in the first place to the discharge of arrears and as representing nomal annuity payments only after the arrears have been cleared off, it is doubtful whether any fill and norraal annuity payment could be reasonably ejected at any time before y 924? the year in which the annuity is intended to terminate. (B) If the suggestion in A is adopted, the only questions that will have to be settled are as follows:- First - What portion of any future receipts from the Persian Government is to be retained by the Imperial Bank? Secondly - In what proportion are the net receipts by the India Office (i•e. the gross receipts from the Persian Government less the amount retained by the Imperlal Bank) to be divided between the India Office and the Treasury? The correct answer to the first question appearsappears to be that (1) an account should be kept shewing separately:- Princi/ al outstanding : i.e. &lt;£290,000 less the amount (£17,979. 4. 5) already received, and any amount that may be hereafter received towards discharge of principal. Interest due: - i.e. arrears of interest on outstanding capital that have accumulated from time to time and interest due on those arrears, / (2) that all receipts from Per si a should he taken in discharge of m Inierest due' until that part of the account is cleared (further receipts, if any, being taken in reduction of m Principal outstanding 9 ) and that the Imperial Bank should be allowed to retain one fifth of all receipts allocated under this arrangement to the discharge of 'Interest aue . The answer to the second question follows from the answer to the first. For, if the patient suggested in paragraph 2 is made by the Treasury to the India Iffiee, ihe offices will be creditors for equal amounts (the actual disbursementso disbursements by the Treasury being equal to the actual net disbursements by the India Office t.lus interest due to that Office) and they will iher’efore divide equally any net receipts accruing in the r future.

They agree with His Majesty’s Government that advance should not he overloaded with too onerous conditions, and that programme elaborated by two Ministers at Tehran could serve as a basis for negotiations with Persian Government.

Further, Russian Government would prefer that advance should in the first place be guaranteed on customs revenues, and that mint profits should serve only as a supplementary guarantee. Instructions in the above sense have been telegraphed to Russian Minister at Tehran, who has at the same time been invited to arrange with his British colleague that article d^of conditions referring to railway question should be so drawn up as to exclude possibility of fictitious Persian companies being formed for railway construction with foreign capital to the detriment of Russian and British interests. Russian Government hope that His Majesty’s Government will send similar instructions to Sir G. Barclay. (Sent to Tehran.) 4 ,sr —IGH [15!V DECYPHER SIR A KICOLSOS SI PETERSlURG D. 3.SO p.n.

(N°. 38.) _ Foreign Office, January 27, ]910, 6 p.m. KUbblAIs contention that a large loan will be necessary to keep Persian Govern ment on its feet is certainly right. In view of Sir G. Barclay’s No. 31, it would be undesirable to demand from Persian Government formal undertaking to apply for a loan, and in view of Sir G. Barclay’s No. 33 it seems unnecessary to make such a demand; for force of circumstances will oblige Persian Government to make the application soon, and Russian loan contract will prevent them from applying to any third Power. Personally, I agree to M. Isvolsky’s suggestion that, when Persian Government do apply, we should join with Russia in facilitating a large loan from foreign bankers by agreeing that machinery of article 5 of Anglo-Russian convention should be available in favour of this loan in case of default. This would not entail financial liability on either British or Russian Governments, but before committing His Majesty’s Government finally I must bring matter before Cabinet, which I trust will be able to meet next week. I hope, however, that this provisional consent on my part will enable us to proceed with the full amount of small joint advance without further delay. It would, I think, be very undesirable to overload the small advance with con ditions, and Sir G. Barclay fears that condition as to Russian iustructors would be so unpopular as to wreck the whole proposal, and with it, of course, the prospect of any application for a larger loan (see Sir G.

Tehran, January 18, 1910, 10'30 p.m. RUSSIAN Minister and I have agreed to attach following six conditions to a joint advance of 400,0001. I have told him I can only consent to first two if we offer no more than 200,0001. He realises that it would he useless to attach all six conditions to the smaller advance, and is urging his Government to lend moiety of 400,0001.:— 1st and 2nd conditions are in my telegram No. 15. 3. Programme of expenditure will not be approved unless it provides for formation of sufficient gendarmerie or road guards for the protection of the trade routes, and Persian Government must undertake that foreign instructors, with the previous approval of the two Powers, shall he engaged in due course. It is understood that no foreign instructor for any Persian force shall he engaged without the previous consent of two Powers. 4. Persia must admit preferential right of Great Britain and Russia as against third parties on equal terms to construct any railways in Persia which they judge^ to he of interest to themselves. This condition does not apply in the case of a concession, sought by a Persian for construction and exploitation with exclusively Persian capital. 5. Persian Government must grant to Tahreez Road Company the Urumia Lake navigation concession. . '6. The advance to he a first charge on the larger loan already asked tor by the Persian Government if that loan is granted, failing which it must he repaid m ten annual instalments, together with 6 per cent, interest, both principal and interest secured on mint profits. Russian Minister wished 4th condition to he worded, as above, as he suspects the Germans of having obtained two years ago the Ivhanikin Railway concession, and he thinks proposed wording will force Persian Government to divulge it if so. As regards 6th condition, wording is my colleague’s. Strictly speaking, Persian Government have not asked for a larger loan, but they have frequently told us that thev must have it. I see no objection to wording. . p xu ‘ I purposely left moment for the engagement of foreign instructors lor the gendarmerie open, as I fear that, if it is made a conditional precedent of the advance, Russian insistence on the employment of Russian instructors would wreck the negotiations.

If your colleague can persuade them to do so, all the better, but we can do no more. I agree to composition of commission, if you think that five Persians will not overweight it. As to gendarmerie, see Sir A. Nicolson’s telegram No. 12. I hope M. Poklewsky will be able to persuade Russian Government to make it a condition. As delay in making advance is prejudicial, we had contemplated deferring condition as to railways—upon which we are not yet in agreement with India Office— until later, but should be ready to agree to some condition in general terms which would safeguard our position. An undertaking might be obtained from the Persian Government that they will not grant a railway concession to a third Power without previous consultation with the British and Russian Governments. The Persian Government must not be the judge of what railways are of interest to us. (Repeated to St. Petersburgh, No. 23.) [lot— i)8|✓ CONFIDENTIAL. n,? ZU \ ■ / Sir G.

I would suggest we should now make to Persian Government a communication in the following sense :— On receiving from Persian Government a detailed programme of expenditure which meets with approval of two legations, the two Governments will, subject to following conditions, be willing to make an advance of 400,000/., placing to Persian Government’s account at each bank 100,000/. now and a further like sum later : Expenditure of money according to programme shall be controlled by a commission composed of Bizot, Mornard, two members of Medjliss, two other Persians, and presided over by Minister of Finance; no payment to any department to be made without the signature of Minister of Finance, with the approval of the commission and of Minister whose department is concerned ; programme of expenditure will not be approved unless it provides for the engagement of seven Frenchmen in Ministry of Finance, with executive powers in accordance with recommendations contained in a report which is now being submitted to Persian Government by M. Bizot; no part of advance will be paid until Persian Government have formally applied to French Government for the loan of these experts. Programme must also include formation of a proper gendarmerie for protection of roads with foreign instructors acceptable to two Powers. Persian Government must undertake that in the event of railway construction in Persia they will give two Powers respectively, in the case of railways which are of special interest to each of them, the refusal upon terms equally favourable to any offers by third parties of any concession which may be in contemplation. Nothing need be said in Paris regarding M. Bizot. If Persian Government accept our condition with regard to French experts it will be desirable to dispense with a financial adviser. Bizot, while unwilling to renew his contract, is willing to carry on provisionally in order to start new experts, though he thinks that he ought to be in France at the time of their selection, in which case he would return to Persia with them, and meanwhile Mornard would be sufficient on the commission of control. This commission can in any case only be regarded as a yis oiler. In present conditions no better is possible, but I could not recommend postponement of advance because of necessarily imperfect character of control. My Russian colleague agrees with above, subject to decision of his Government on the question (1) of gendarmerie instructors ; (2) of making Urumia Lake con cession, negotiations with Imam Kuli having failed, a fifth condition of [?loan]. Owing probably to a heavy snowfall, neither Russian Minister nor I yet know Russian Government’s decision, but I assume from your No. 11 that Russian Govern ment have consented to a joint advance of 400,000/. in two instalments.

He says it is weakening the party in Medjliss favourable to advance, and strengthening the party opposed to it. It is also tying the hands of Persian Govern ment, who feel that until they have had reply they are precluded from seeking money by other means, e.g., by a sale of Crown jewels. He said hitherto he had discouraged resort to other means, but long delay was so prejudicial to Government that he was in doubt how much longer they should wait.

The money is required for policing the roads, pay ing the troops, and generally for maintaining order in the country. We have received the following from the Persian Legation :— “ There is no foundation for the news pub lished by some newspapers that the Persian Government has made fresh proposals to his Britannic Majesty’s and to the Russian Govern ments for an advance of £40,000 or £400,000.

P ^ r m e nm7 he T+i S 0n whlch the best chance of success depends—the borrowing 0 500,000k and the engagement of foreign advisers—being accepted only subject to the eventual approval by the Medjliss of the conditions attached to the advance and of the terms on which foreign advisers are to be engaged. On the 12th instant the mister for Foreign Affairs called privately at the two legations to give us notice that the application for the advance would be made on the following day, and to urge upon my colleague and me the pressing need of the Persian Government and the desirability o± keeping back any disagreeable conditions until the negotiations for the larger loan contemplated in the Ministerial programme for the extinction of the floating debt. On the following day as already reported by telegraph, his Highness caUed again, this time accompanied by the Minister of Finance, and formally applied for the advance, which the two Ministers declared to be imperatively needed for the restoration of order ana re forms in the administration, especially in the Department of Finance. femce the^ application for the advance things have marked time in Tehran, the Cabinet is anxiously awaiting to learn the conditions which the two Powers decide to attach to the advance, and loses no opportunity of impressing upon my colleague and me that its resignation will follow a breakdown of the negotiations. It is from no desire to spare Persian susceptibilities that I have sought in some degree to restrict the scope of our conditions. In so doing I have been actuated solely by my conception of the joint interest of the two Powers, which I cannot but think would be best served by giving, as promptly as may be, a substantial sum to the present Government. The relative tranquillity which has marked the period since the revolution may last through the winter months, but I look forward to the coming of spring, when the tribes commence their summer migration, with no little apprehen sion, unless by that time the Central Government has gained strength to prevent a recrudescence of disorder, and this it can only do by obtaining funds without delay and using them aright. The failure of the Government to re-establish its authority must sooner or later necessitate the intervention of the two Powers, however reluctant they may be to take such a step, and I feel that I should be greatly to blame in this eventuality if the failure of the Government had come about through a breakdown of the present negotiations due to any demand which I had suggested over and above those which I had deemed strictly necessary in order to ensure, as far as possible, the proper employment of the money. Indeed, I consider that only success would justify the fourth condition which I suggested in my telegram No. 800, viz., that relating to the oar-marking of railways, and if later it should appear likely to wreck the advance, I sndMdTeglad to see it waived in so far that we might, while foregoing any undertaking m the sense desired, content ourselves merely with making the joint communication indicated in the 12th paragraph of the memorandum handed to M. Isvolsky on the 18th October, 1908. The other three conditions which I suggested are all designed to secure, as far as may be, the useful employment of the money. The form of control 1 [2582 r—3] i i2 is, I think, the best that could be devised for the moment, though we might stipulate for the addition to the commission of one or more of the French experts, who, it is proposed should be engaged. But in order that this control should be really effective it will be necessary that the gendarmerie, to which a great part of the money should be devotf should receive their pay through European channels, and for this reason, if for no othei it would be very desirable that European instructors should be engaged. If, however’ Bussia cannot be persuaded to admit the engagement of any Europeans but Russians in the North, it seems open to question whether it might not be wiser to drop even this condition, so much do I fear that, sooner than consent to the engagement of more Russian officers, the Medjliss, which already looks on the Cossack Brigade as differing little from a Russian force, may prefer to forego any financial assistance from the two Powers. As regards the state of public order in the province during the past four weeks the only event of any importance reported has been a fight near Sarab a day or two ago between a son of Rahim Khan and some of the Government force sent from Tehran. Sardar Assad’s son commanded the Government troops, and the fight is said to have resulted in the complete defeat of Rahim Khan’s men. The state of the Bushire-Ispahan road was up to the last few days, if anything, worse than when last I Wr ?o-u • ^ ^ ~ earn morn hig that a few caravans are passing now between Kazeroon and bhiraz, the Boir Ahmadi tribesmen having been compelled by the severe cold to abandon their encampments, and that the road between Ispahan and Yezdikhast is no onger blocked by Kuhgelui. Latest advices also denote some improvement on the ermanshah-Hamadan road. I have no further details regarding the situation at bniraz, but the two consuls continue to press my colleague and me to urge the dismissal of Sowlet-ed-Dowleh from the Ilkhaniship of the Kashgai, with whom M. Passek is naturally very indignant, as he believes him to be responsible for the recent attack on his caravan.

I also am loath to waive gendarmerie and railway conditions, but in case of an advance of 200,000L—less than half of what was asked—-I think there wonld be only a remote chance of the Medjliss accepting if we insisted on more than the first two of our conditions, and of course the sixth mutatis mutandis. I also think there will be small hope of the Medjliss of accepting even 400,000Z. if our six conditious are made more onerous. Although when applying for advance Persian Government foreshadowed a request for a larger loan, such is the distrust of Russia that it would, I think, jeopardise chances of the acceptance by the Medjliss of the advance if we demanded from Persian Government formal undertaking to apply to us later for the loan. If things go well I see no reason to doubt that they will in due course spontaneously apply to the two Powers for a loan. They will need it long before 1912, when the embargo on loans from a third party expires. (Repeated to St. Petersburgh.) &gt; i * \\CONFIDENTIAL.

I cannot deny that there is some ground for Minister for Foreign Affairs’ apprehensions.

It is most earnestly to be hoped that there will be no further delay in replying to the Persian Government’s application for the advance, and that Russia will refrain from insisting, at least as a condition of the advance, on the engagement of Russian instructors, a condition which I can see no hope of the Medjliss accepting.

St. Petersburgh, January 23, 1910, 2*38 p.m. PERSIAN advance. Yonr telegram No^SS. I told Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that His Majesty’s Government proposed to adopt his suggestion and advance their full quota at once. He replied that he had thrown out that idea, but had hoped that difference in the amounts of the respective contributions should not be made public; and since he had made the suggestion the question had somewhat changed. He is correct in his recollection, and I had informed him that it would be most difficult to keep fact secret that the contributions varied in amount (see your telegram No?* 3). I urged him to join with us in making full advance of 400,000Z. He said that he might be able to do so if we could obtain from Persian Government a request to be supplied later on with a large loan. I told him that we were considering his memorandum as to a large loan, but that it would take time. He replied that he did not expect us to go into the details at once, but that if the Persian Government made a request for a loan he thought that it would be possible for the Russian Government to make full advance on account, but on conditions. He had received the six conditions, and would have to inake some observations on one or two of them. I returned to question of our immediately making advance of our full quota, and pointed out that we were anxious to give Persian Government as much as possible to enable them to clear the southern roads, as our trade was practically blocked. On his side he urged that we should both endeavour to induce Persian Government to formulate a request for a loan, and if they did this he gave me to understand that Russian Government would probably be able to give their full quota. The upshot is as follows :— 1. M. Isvolsky abandons his original suggestion] that Jwe should make our full advance, and apparently is not in favour of our doing so. 2. He would make the full advance if the Persian Government formally request a loan, but then only under conditions which the Persian Government might not accept. 3. If you would wish, in view of opening the southern roads, to insist on our making our full advance, I would tell Minister for Foreign Affairs that we considered it imperative to do so. Minister for Foreign Affairs has received Russian Minister at Tehran’s recommendations as to larger advance, but the Russian Government evidently will not go so far except in the circumstances I have indicated above.

It would be most desirable that Russian Minister at Tehran should put all the pressure he can on his Government to make the second advance within a reasonable time. I do not think that I can do any more here, and perhaps the Urumia Lake concession could be utilised with success as a lever if it could be shown that the only chance of obtaining it would be by being generous in the matter of money assistance.

Persia must admit preferential right of Great Britain and .Russia as against third parties on equal terms to construct any railways in Persia which they judge^ to he of interest to themselves.

Russian Minister wished 4th condition to he worded as above, as he suspects the Germans of having obtained two years ago the Khanikin Railway concession, and he thinks proposed wording will force Persian Government to divulge it if so. As regards 6th condition, wording is my colleague’s. Strictly speaking, Persian Government have not asked for a larger loan, but they have frequently told us that they must have it. I see no objection to wording. I purposely left moment for the engagement of foreign instructors for the gendarmerie open, as I fear that, if it is made a conditional precedent of the advance, Russian insistence on the employment of Russian instructors would wreck the negotiations.

An undertaking might be obtained from the Persian Government that they will not grant a railway concession to a third Power without previous consultation with the British and Russian Governments.

There must be, of course, such control as we can exercise even for the 200,000/., and the engagement of foreign financial experts, indispensable as it is for any permanent impiovement, and involving as it does only inconsiderable expenditure should be insisted on at this stage. In the circumstances I should not wish to press for the employment of any portion of this small advance on the gendarmerie. More urgent than the institution of such a force is the re-establishment of a state of things where a gendarmerie or road guards could suffice to maintain order. Persian Government should, I think, be allowed to spend this money on punitive expeditions or such other military measures as they may think advisable in the interests of their prestige. When my Russian colleague is authorised to discuss conditions with me, I propose to take above line. [151—55]CONFIDENTIAL Sh' A.

I would suggest we should now make to Persian Government a communication in the following sense :— On receiving from Persian Government a detailed programme of expenditure which meets with approval of two legations, the two Governments will, subject to following* conditions, be willing to make an advance of 400,000/., placing to Persian Government’s account at each bank 100,000/. now and a further like sum later : Expenditure of money according to programme shall be controlled by a commission composed of Bizot, Mornard, two members of Medjliss, two other Persians, and presided over by Minister of Finance; no payment to any department to be made without the signature of Minister of Finance, with the approval of the commission and of Minister whose department is concerned ; programme of expenditure will not be approved unless it provides for the engagement of seven Frenchmen in Ministry of Finance, with executive powers in accordance with recommendations contained in a report which is now being submitted to Persian Government by M. Bizot; no part of advance will be paid until Persian Government have formally applied to French Government for the loan of these experts. Programme must also include formation of a proper gendarmerie for protection of roads with foreign instructors acceptable to two Powers. Persian Government must \ undertake that in the event of railway construction in Persia they will give two Powers \ respectively, in the case of railways which are of special interest to each of them, the [ refusal upon terms equally favourable to any offers by third parties of any concession which may be in contemplation. Nothing need be said in Paris regarding M. Bizot. If Persian Government accept our condition with regard to French experts it will be desirable to dispense with a financial adviser. Bizot, while unwilling to renew his contract, is willing to carry on provisionally in order to start new experts, though he thinks that he ought to be in France at the time of their selection, in which case he would return to Persia with them, and meanwhile Mornard would be sufficient on the commission of control. This commission can in any case only be regarded as a pis oiler. In present conditions no better is possible, but I could not recommend postponement of advance because of necessarily imperfect character of control. My Russian colleague agrees with above, subject to decision of his Government on the question (1) of gendarmerie instructors ; (2) of making Urumia Lake con cession, negotiations with Imam Kuli having failed, a fifth condition of [? loan]. Owing probably to a heavy snowfall, neither Russian Minister nor I yet know Russian Government’s decision, but I assume from your No. 11 that Russian Govern ment have consented to a joint advance of 400,000/. in two instalments.
