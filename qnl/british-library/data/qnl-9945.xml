TO ACCOMPANY TABLE OF TRIBES. The classification of tlie Arabian tribes or clans inhabiting c Oman into two great divisions, cc Hinawi' and ' GMfiri,' is peculiar to that kingdom, and has been adopted in comparatively recent times. The modern history of 4 Oman being mainly the narrative of the contentions between these great rival factions, a precise understanding of their mutual relations, and the origin of their differences, is desirable. With a view to a clear explanation of these points it is necessary to refer back to the older and better known tribal classifications. Arabian historians have divided all the tribes of Arabia into three primary classes. 15^. El 'Arab el 'Arabeh, i.e., pure Arabs, those created speaking Arabic. 2nd. El 'Arab el Mota'arribeh, or genuine Arabs, those who acquired the Arabic language. El 'Arab el Mosta'ribeh, or the naturalized Arabs. Of these three classes the first is considered to be lost or extinct, and there remain the classes known to Europeans as genuine Arabs and naturalized Arabs. The former consists of those descendants of Kahtan (or Joktan of Scrip ture), many of whom settled in Yemen, and they are also termed Kahtanite or Yemenite Arabs. The naturalized Arabs are said to be descended from Ishmael, but do not trace pedigree further back than 'Adnan. This class is termed Ishmaelite, 'Adnanite or Ma'addite, and also Nizarite, from ISTizar bin Ma'add. The first Arab settlers in e Oman came from Yemen, and were Kahtanite. Later immigrants arrived from the westward, and were mostly tribes of the Ishmaelite branch.For instance, in the province of Dhahireh tlie Chief of the Beni Ghafir is styled Temimet-el-Ghafiriyeh, and looked upon as a sort of referee in matters affecting the the general interests of the Ghafiris. The Hinawis of c Oman have been usually accustomed to respect the reign ing Seyyid of the Al-bu-Sa c eed as their Temimet. The above remarks are intended to supplement a table which has been pre pared of the principal tribes; perhaps they may also help to elucidate the some what complicated question of the growth and mutual relations of the rival parties in the state of £ Oman.
