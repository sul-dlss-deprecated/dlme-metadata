Under Supplementary Rules 305 and 304 I was entitled to 26 days' Joining Time (13 days from Mohammerah to Karachi and 12 days from Karachi to Bushire) but I could not take more than the period actually taken in transmission of letters due to a misinterpretation - vide Bushire Residency Circular Memorandum No, IflOO dated the 2tjth August 1931, Recently, the 'inisterial establishments of the Persian Gulf Residency proceeding on or returning from leave have enjoyed the maximum period of joining time admissible under Supolemeritary Rules 303 and 504: I therefore request that I may be allowed the maximum period of joining time and ¥ my leave in consequence may be curtailed to 15 days as shown below:- Jolning time between Moha.nmerah and Karachi 24th February to 8th March 1935 - 13 days Leave on average pay from 9th March to 8th'June - 3 months Joining time between Karachi and Buthire 9th June to 19th June 1935 ■' i * ■ . \ Your most obedient Servant No. 18*7-1/36. \ Forwarded and recommended to the Secretary to the 'Hj, . • Hon/ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buthire. i ' Captain, Offg» Political Agent, Bahrain,/. - - Wo. 64/154 M' L Dated the May 1936. 4 To The Political Agent, B A H B A 1 N. r V gSMAYigy.
