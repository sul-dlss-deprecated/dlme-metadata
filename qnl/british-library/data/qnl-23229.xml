The first chapter deals with the Residency generally and the second chapter describes conditions at Bahrein in some detail. In the subsequent chapters the conditions in the other States are described in so far as they differ from those at Bahrein and information is given on local customs and neighbouring countries.CHAPTER I.—GENERAL The Persian Gulf Residency was originally established by the East India Company in the 18th century and until 1947 the Residency worked under the control of the Government of India but in that year His Majesty s The Political Resident Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s representative foi all the States in the area and is assisted by a Secretary and an Under-Secretary. Three Political Agents who are subordinate to the Political Resident aie responsible for direct dealings with the various States as follows:— Political Agent, Bahrein Bahrein, Qatar, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, viz., Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-al- Qaiwain, Ras-al-Khaimah and Kalba. Political Agent, Koweit Koweit. His Majesty’s Consul and Political Muscat and Oman with its depen- Agent, Muscat dencies, Dhofar and Gwadur. With the exception of Muscat, all these States are described as being independent Sheikhdoms in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and under British protection. Muscat is a sovereign State and has treaties with the United States, France and Holland as well as with His Majesty’s Government. All the States have ceded jurisdiction to His Majesty’s Government but the extent of such jurisdiction varies. In Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms it is exercised over all British subjects and foreigners, in Koweit and Qatar over all British subjects and non-Muslim foreigners and in Muscat over British subjects and employees only. British passport authorities are authorised to grant visas on behalt ot the Gulf States. Except in the case of male British subjects visiting the Gulf for official purposes or as representatives or members of some reputable firm a reference to the Political Agent is necessary before a visa can be granted. There are no hotels of European standard in any of the Gulf States and applicants for visas may be asked what arrangements they have made for accommodation. Visas are not required for persons in transit by air through the Gulf States. 3 CHAPTER II.—BAHREIN Bahrein consists of a group of small low-lying islands situated half-way down the Persian Gulf some 20 miles off the eastern coast of Arabia. The largest island which is known as Bahrein Island is about 30 miles long and 10 miles wide at its broadest. The northern end and a strip along the western coast are well watered and fertile and the rest of the island is desert. The two most important towns are Manamah and Muharraq. The latter is situated on a separate island which is connected with the main island by a causeway two miles long. Manamah is the main business centre and the Political Agency is situated there. The Residency at Jufair, His Highness the Sheikh’s palace at Rifa’a, and the Oil Company’s camp at Awali are at distances of 4, 9 and 11 miles respectively from Manamah. All these places are connected by good roads and anyone making a long stay on the Island ' 1 / ■V v v • v ' » will find it useful to have his own car as there are no public bus services and taxis are expensive. . The population of the islands is estimated at 105,000 souls. The population of Muharraq Island is mostly Arab, but that of Manamah is extremely mixed. In addition to Arabs of varying origin including a number from Nejd, many Persians and a fair number of Indians are found there. The villages on the main island are mostly inhabited by Bahama, cultivators of the date gardens who speak Arabic but are of the Shiah faith. The Sheikh rules personally and is assisted by a British Adviser who performs the functions of Chief Minister. The State has a number of other British employees and is being gradually developed on modern lines. There are about 800 British, European and American subjects on the i island. Of these the majority reside in the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s camp at Awali and most of the rest in Manamah. The R.A.F. have a small detachment on Muharraq Island. His Majesty’s Ships pay frequent visits to Jufair. The Political Resident and the Political Agent keep calling books in which visitors to Bahrein who desire to meet them can enter their names. His Highness the Sheikh does not keep a calling book. Officials in the employment of His Majesty’s Government wishing to call on him should make arrangements through the Political Agent. The Bahrein Petroleum Company which operates the oilfields and refinery on the island has its headquarters in Awali and Messrs. Petroleum Con cessions Limited, who are operating at Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, have their head office in Manamah. The Eastern Bank and Imperial Bank of Iran have branches in Manamah. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie have a large office in Manamah and handle most of the shipping. Bahrein exports only oil and pearls, but is an entrepot for trade with other Gulf States and with Saudi Arabia. The dates grown are insufficient for local needs, and apart from these practically all the necessities of life have to be imported. Bahrein is the terminus for a weekly B.O.A.C. service from the United Kingdom. In addition 6 services between the United Kingdom on the one hand and India, the Far East and Australia on the other, call at Bahrein in each direction per week. Iraqi Airways land-planes flying between Bagdad and Karachi call at Bahrein once a week in each direction. The sea-plane anchorage is off the north-east corner of the main island and the land aerodrome is on Muharraq Island. The British India Steam Navigation Company fast mail services call fortnightly in each direction and slow mail steamers also call. Bv fast mail steamer the journey from Bombay to Bahrein takes about 6 days, from Karachi to Bahrein 4 days and from Basra to Bahrein 2 days. There are also direct sailings between the United Kingdom and Bahrein by cargo steamers of the Strick Line which carry a few passengers. The British India Steam Navigation Company steamers anchor a few miles oft Manamah, while other lines usually call at Sitra where the Bahrein Petroleum Company “T have a wharf for ocean-going vessels. Messrs. Cable and Wireless have an ' J office in Manamah and deal with all telegraphic correspondence. There is a post office in Manamah and British stamps surcharged Bahrein and with rupee values are used. Air mails are received and despatched almost daily and letters take from 5 to 7 days between addresses in Bahrein and the United Kingdom. The surface mail is most irregular and letters and parcels may take from two to three months to arrive. Bahrein is in the sterling area and the currency ordinarily used is the Indian rupee. _ . The climate of the Gulf is notorious. In Bahrein it is exceedingly hot and damp from May till October, though during most of June the heat is usually moderated by a strong north wind. July, August and September are the worst months. The temperatures rarely rise above 104 degrees on the coast and 115 degrees in the middle of the island but the humidity often &amp;4 exceeds 90 per cent. For about two months from towards the end of Decem ber till towards the end of February, the weather is extremely pleasant and sometimes quite cold, the temperature having been known to drop as low as 40 degrees For the rest of the year the weather is hot but not unpleasantly so. The annual rainfall is from two to three inches a year. Its incidence is very irregular but it is most likely to occur in December and January. Accommodation can occasionally be had in the B.O.A.C. R^t House but it is usually fully occupied by passengers stopping the night there. Generally speaking therefore nothing in the nature of hotel accommodation is available in Bahrein for European and American visitors and they should make sure before they leave that they have a house to stay in or friends who will put them up. + D or&gt; Local servants are obtainable. A house boy will cost at least Rs. oU a month and a cook probably Rs. 100 or more. Servants are not provided with food but their employer is expected to get them clothes to wear when on duty in the house. In most cases they live out in their homes in the town. No woman servants are employed except as nurses, but women who are suitable for taking charge of European children are not easy to find. No servants should be employed without previous reference to the Bahrein Police and it is advisable to have them vetted by a doctor. Generally speaking all necessary food supplies can be obtained in Manamah. Meat and fish are usually plentiful and poultry is procurable. There is little fresh fruit apart from fresh dates, melons and papayas in their season but green vegetables are usually available and in the winter most European vege tables are procurable. Fresh milk is generally obtainable in Manamah but preserved milk is used exclusively at Awali. The shops stock supplies of tinned goods of all description. Cooking is done mainly on oil stoves. Oil coke, a product of the oil refinery, is used for heating water and for fires in the houses. The local water is slightly brackish and when first drunk has the effect of a mild dose of salts. Distilled water can be purchased locally. Bahrein is a Muslim state and officially “ dry ” but Europeans and Americans are allowed to purchase or import liquor for their own use. Liquor is sold by Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and is cheap as the Customs duty is low but permits to purchase have to be obtained from the Political Agent. The Manamah bazaar is well stocked and most of the necessities of life can be purchased there. In the summer, men usually wear open-necked shirts and slacks or shorts and light tropical suits on formal occasions. In the evening white open- necked short-sleeved shirts, white trousers, black shoes and socks and, on formal occasions, a black cummerbund are usually worn. A thin black or white dinner jacket is required for official dinner parties in the hot weather and for more ordinary occasions in the intermediate seasons. Aertex or cellular day shirts are the most suitable as they absorb sweat. Silk is not suitable for wear next to the skin in very hot weather as it becomes damp and creases. Light brown leather or suede shoes or sandals are usually worn and can be obtained locally. Sun helmets are only worn by men who are liable to be out in the sun all day. In the cold weather ordinary tweed suits are worn or flannel trousers and sports coats; dinner jackets are used in the evening. It is cold enough for pullovers and overcoats to be required. One good lounge suit is required for formal occasions. Material for both summer and winter suitings and for shirts can be obtained in the bazaar and local tailors are available who are reasonably good. Almost every thing that is required in the way of clothing can be obtained in the bazaar. Washing frocks preferably cotton are the best wear for women in the very hot weather. Light frocks are usually worn from April till December and three or four linen or cotton evening dresses are essential for the hot weather. Hats5 are rarely worn but are required on some occasions such as official parties. It is not necessary to wear stockings in the summer. In the cold season, women require the type of clothes that are worn in England in April and May with the addition of a really warm coat, some afternoon frocks and a few dinner frocks. Material can be obtained and clothes made in the bazaar. Clothes are generally washed by Indian dhobies or washermen who keep them for a week and on the whole wash them quite well. On the whole, Bahrein is fairly free from tropical diseases though a certain amount of dysentery is prevalent. Visitors to Bahrein should be vaccinated and should be inoculated for T.A.B. as smallpox and typhoid sometimes occur. Prickly heat which is liable to develop into boils is very prevalent in the hot weather. The use of salt tablets is recommended during the worst months to prevent heat exhaustion. There is nothing to shoot in Bahrein except a few snipe, and the import of arms and ammunition is forbidden. The import of dogs is also prohibited unless the owner can produce a certificate from a qualified veterinary surgeon to the effect that the dog has been inoculated with anti-rabies vaccine as Bahrein is free from rabies. Members of the Gymkhana Club at Manamah can use the golf course, tennis courts and swimming pool. There is good sea bathing at some places on the coast though in the summer the water becomes too hot to be pleasant; there is no danger from sharks. There is fairly good sea fishing to be had and some people own sailing boats. Cricket is played regularly in the cold weather. There is no public library and no newspaper of any kind is published. English books and newspapers can be purchased in some of the shops. , . ., , , There is a Catholic church with a resident priest in Manamah and a mission church of the Dutch Reformed Church of America. Anglican services are held occasionally by visiting Chaplains. Bahrein is m the diocese of the Anglican Bishopric in Jerusalem. The language in Bahrein is Arabic but in the towns a good deal of Persian and some Hindustani is spoken. Most of the leading shop-keepers speak ^ n ^Friday is observed as the weekly holiday by the Bahrein Government, the Political Agency, the Oil Company, the banks and most institutions on the island. At the Residency, Sunday is still observed as the weekly holiday. There is no income-tax in Bahrein and the only form of taxation to which a visitor would ordinarily be liable is customs duty upon goods imported from abroad. The rates are 5 per cent, ad valorem on all foodstuffs and necessities, 10 per cent, on non-essential imports and 15 per cent, on tobacco and liquor. Worn personal effects are not liable to duty.

Thlre are a^ew tennis courts in Koweit and there is sea bathing but no fresh water swimming bath. Except for a few sand grouse in the desert there is Uttle shooting to be had locally but duck and snipe shooting can be had at Basra. CHAPTER IV.—QATAR O € 9 Oatar is an ungainly peninsula on the Arabian mainland about 100 miles l„n. and averaging 30 miles in width. It is almost waterless and consists largely of low banen hills. The only town of any importance is Dohah on the 8 east coast where there is a fairly extensive bazaar. The Sheikh lives S Riyan a few miles inland. The total population of the peninsula is only7 about 16,000 and consists mostly of miscellaneous Arabs who before the advent of the Oil Company obtained their living from pearl diving. The Oil Company maintain a landing strip but there is no air or steamer service to the peninsula and access to it is normally had by launch from Bahrein by way of either Zakrit, the Oil Company’s present port on the west coast, or by Dohah. The Oil Company—Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited—has its headquarters at Dukhan near the west coast of the peninsula. Oil has been found but the Company’s operations have not yet reached the production stage. The climate is similar to that of Bahrein except that it is slightly less humid. There are no amenities other than those provided by the Oil Company. The American Mission have recently opened a dispensary at Dohah. There are no postal and telegraph facilities. CHAPTER V.—TRUCIAL COAST The Trucial Coast is the name given to the low-lying open coast stretching from the base of the Qatar peninsula on its eastern side up to the hills of the Musandam peninsula a short way beyond Ras al Khaimah. Before 1820, the coast was known as the Pirate Coast and it is now known as the Trucial Coast because the Sheikhdoms situated on it have undertaken to observe a perpetual truce with each other and the world at large on the sea. In Arabic the coast is known as the “ Sahil Oman ” or the Oman Coast. The number of Trucial Sheikhdoms was originally 5 and owing to the splitting up of the Sheikhdom of Sharjah has become 7. Of the 7 Sheikhdoms the most westerly, Abu Dhabi, is by far the largest and is the most powerful tribally but the area it covers is mostly desert and its capital, Abu Dhabi, is difficult of access. The next Sheikhdom proceeding in a north-easterly direction is Dubai. This Sheikhdom does not cover a very large area but the town is the largest on the coast and said to possess 38,000 inhabitants. There is a large and well-stocked bazaar and the Imperial Bank of Iran and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie have branches here, and Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), Limited, who are prospecting for oil on the Trucial Coast, have an office. His Majesty’s Government maintain a dispensary under an Indian doctor. There is a British post office where British stamps surcharged with rupee values only are used. The B.I.S.N. slow mail steamers make irregular calls. Dubai is the main centre of supply for the whole of the Trucial Coast and its hinterland and there is much trade by country craft with Persia. There are no local products and Dubai depends for its existence on its entrepot trade and pearl diving. „ . „ The next Sheikhdom is Sharjah which has lost much of its former glory owing to the bulk of its territory having been formed into independent Sheikhdoms and the silting up of its creek which has ruined it as a commercial centre. The Political Officer and the Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, have their headquarters here. The Political Officer, who is British, normally resides here only during the cold weather. During the hot weather the Residency Agent, who is an Arab, is responsible to the Political Agent, Bahrein, for dealings with the Sheikhdoms. There is an aerodrome here maintained by a detachment of the R.A.F. and a Rest House which is staffed by the B.O.A.C. Accommodation for visitors is usually available in this R.est House. The B.O.A.C. maintain a telegraph service for the public acting as agents ol Cable and Wireless. An Iraqi Airways service between Bagdad and Karachi calls at Sharjah once weekly in each direction. R.A.F. aircraft from Shaibah and Bahrein also visit Sharjah once or twice a week and official visitors canoften obtain passages to and from Sharjah in these. B.I.S.N. slow mail steamers call at Sharjah irregularly. . . The next two Sheikhdoms are Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwam. At Ras- al-Khaimah there is an emergency alighting base for flying-boats. There are fairly extensive date gardens in the sub-montane area of this Sheikhdom and much of the country is covered with natural vegetation. The last Sheikhdom, Kalba, is situated beyond the hills on the Gulf of Oman. Climatic conditions on the Trucial Coast are similar to those at Bahrein. There are certain facilities available at Dubai and Sharjah as described above but apart from this the Sheikhdoms are undeveloped. Chapter VI.—MUSCAT The territory under the sway of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman includes a sea-board of over a thousand miles from the Musandam peninsula to Ras Durbat Ali where the province of Dhofar borders on the Aden Protectorate. He also exercises sovereignty over Gwadur on the Mekran coast and a small strip of territory around it which borders on Kalat State. The bulk of the country consists of bare hills but there is a fertile strip for about 150 miles along the Batinah Coast north of Muscat where there is a chain of date gardens. There are many fertile oases in the Oman hills the produce of which finds its way to the coast and in Dhofar which receives the monsoon rains there are groves of coconut palms, millet and sugar cane crops are grown and the frankincense tree is found amongst the hills. The only towns of any size are the ports of Muscat, Matrah and Gwadur and Matrah which is the biggest of these contains less than 9,000 inhabitants. The population of Muscat and Matrah is very mixed and includes a large number of Indians both Hindus and Khojas, and Baluchis. There are many Baluchis on the Batinah Coast but elsewhere the population is mostly Arab. The bulk of the Arabs in Oman including the Sultan and his relatives are neither Sunni nor Shiah but belong to the Ibadhi sect of Mohammedans. At Gwadur there is a wealthy colony of followers of the Aga Khan and the rest of the inhabitants are mostly Baluchis. The Sultan who can speak English well has his seat of government at Muscat. He exercises control through numerous Walis or Governors located in different parts of his dominions. He possesses a force of about 300 trained men, mostly Baluchis, known as the Muscat Infantry under a British Com mandant. It is stationed at Bait-al-Falaj about 5 miles from Muscat. The representative of His Majesty’s Government resides at Muscat and is represented at Gwadur by an Indian clerk who is known as the British Agent. The British community at Muscat is a small one and rarely exceeds 10 persons. The American Dutch Reformed Church Mission maintains a doctor at Matrah and a pastor at Muscat. Two American ladies, one of whom previously belonged to the Mission, run a dispensary on the Batinah Coast. All these Americans usually spend two or three months of the hot weather in India. There is less social life generally than at Bahrein and Koweit but more mixing with local communities and there is a club at which Europeans, State officials including members of the Sultan’s family, and Indians meet. Tennis and bridge are played. B.I.S.N. slow mail steamers call at Muscat in each direction once a fortnight. There is a landing ground at Bait-al-Falaj but it cannot be used by most modern types of aircraft and there is no air service. There are aerodromes maintained by small detachments of the R.A.F. at Salalah ino 9 Dhofar and on Masirah Island. R.A.F. aircraft from Aden visit these aerodromes from time to time but they are not used by any regular air service. Cable and Wireless maintain a cable station at Muscat and there is a post office there. There is a post and telegraph office at Gwadur, and telegrams are sent by land line via Panjgur in Makran to Karachi. There is a rest house at Gwadur where travellers can stay but there is no cook. The local currency in Muscat and Oman proper is the Maria Theresa dollar and this is the only coin current in the interior. Indian rupees are also current in Muscat town and Matrah and elsewhere on the coast and are the sole currency at Gwadur. The exchange rate between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varies. Before the war the rupee was worth slightly more than the dollar but at present the rate is over two rupees to the dollar. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie have a branch at Muscat and there is a fish meal factory run by a local Khoja at Matrah. Dates, dried fish and fish meal are exported to India and elsewhere. At present there is no bank at Muscat. Oil Companies subsidiary to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, hold prospecting licences for the whole of the Sultan’s dominions excluding Gwadur but no oil has yet been found. The climate is more severe than at Bahrein and warm clothes are only occasionally needed. The heat at Muscat in the early summer and autumn is intense. It is sometimes moderated during August by monsoon winds from the south. Very little rain falls on the coast. The main bazaar is at Matrah where local produce can be obtained and there are one or two shops in Muscat where a limited amount of imported groceries can be purchased. Other requirements have to be obtained from Bahrein or India. Local sanitation is almost non-existent and dysentery is prevalent. Malaria is pre valent wherever there is cultivation. The British Government maintain a medical officer at Muscat who is in charge of the quarantine arrangements and a local dispensary, and medical assistance can also be obtained from the American Mission hospital at Matrah. There is no State medical service. There is good sea bathing to be had when the water is not infested with jelly fish and the sea never becomes as hot as it does at Bahrein. The gardens on the Batinah Coast are full of partridge and there are some duck and geese to be had on the small creeks along this coast and in Dhofar. CHAPTER VII.—LOCAL CUSTOMS Generally speaking the inhabitants of the Gulf States are extremely polite and courteous to European and American visitors. When a visitor enters an Arab house he is ordinarily offered coffee in a small cup without handles. Not more than three cups should be taken at a time. On returning the cup to the servant it should be shaken when it is desired to show that no more is required. When seated on the ground it is considered rude to point the soles of one’s feet towards any other person in the gathering. Shorts should not be worn when calling on a person of any consequence as it is considered impolite to show the knees, and ladies should wear stockings. An Arab meal is normally eaten on the ground without knives and forks, though spoons are often provided. It should be remembered that food should only be handled with the right hand. Water is always offered for washing the hands both before and after the meal. In most of the Gulf States, rose-water and incense are passed round at the conclusion of a visit as a sign for the guest to leave. CHAPTER VHI.—NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES India and Pakistan.— The Gulf States are linked to India and Pakistan bv old commercial ties, and B.I.S.N. steamers maintain regular services with Bombay and Karachi. British Political Officers in the Gulf are responsible14889 35669 10 for the welfare of the subjects of both Dominions and are empowered to grant visas to travellers visiting them. Saudi Arabia .—Launches of the Arabian American Oil Company ply constantly between Manamah in Bahrein and A1 Khobar, a distance of about 20 miles. The Oil Company has its headquarters at Dhahran a few miles inland from A1 Khobar. Goods for Saudi Arabia imported via Bahrein are mostly carried by country craft to Oqair. The desert route between Koweit and Riyadh is passable by motor vehicles and goods are carried over it by both lorry and camel. The Saudi Arabian Government maintains unofficial Trade Agents at both Bahrein and Koweit. Visas for Saudi Arabia cannot be obtained in any of the Gulf States but the Arabian American Oil Company sometimes make arrangements for travellers from Bahrein visiting the mainland under their auspices to be given visas on landing. There is a Saudi Arabian Consul at Basra. Iraq .—There is constant communication between the Gulf States and Iraq by sea and air and so far as Koweit is concerned by land. British Political Officers in the Gulf are empowered to grant visas for Iraq. Visitors to the Gulf States travelling via Iraq should be careful to arm themselves with vaccination and inoculation certificates in accordance with the regulations in force in the country at the time, otherwise they may be delayed. Foreign Office, August, 1948Handbook on the Persian Gulf INTRODUCTORY These notes are designed for the information of visitors to the Arab States in the area covered by the Persian Gulf Residency. The first chapter deals with the Residency generally and the second chapter describes conditions at Bahrein in some detail. In the subsequent chapters the conditions in the other States are described in so far as they differ from those at Bahrein and information is given on local customs and neighbouring countries.CHAPTER I.—GENERAL The Persian Gulf Residency was originally established by the East India Company in the 18th century and until 1947 the Residency worked under the control of the Government of India but in that year His Majesty s Government took over direct control which is exercised through the foreign Office The Political Resident Persian Gulf is His Majesty’s representative for all the States in the area and is assisted by a Secretary and an Under-Secretary. Three Political Agents who are subordinate to the Political Resident are responsible for direct dealings with the various States as follows:— Political Agent, Bahrein ... Bahrein, Qatar, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, viz., Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-al- Qaiwain, Ras-al-Khaimah and Political Agent, Koweit Koweit. His Majesty’s Consul and Political Muscat and Oman with its depen- Agent, Muscat dencies, Dhofar and Gwadur. With the exception of Muscat, all these States are described as being independent Sheikhdoms in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and under British protection. Muscat is a sovereign State and has treaties with the United States, France and Holland as well as with His Majesty’s Government. . . All the States have ceded jurisdiction to His Majesty’s Government but the extent of such jurisdiction varies. In Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms it is exercised over all British subjects and foreigners, in Koweit and Qatar over all British subjects and non-Muslim foreigners and in Muscat over British subjects and employees only. British passport authorities are authorised to grant visas on behalt ot the Gulf States. Except in the case of male British subjects visiting the Gulf for official purposes or as representatives or members of some reputable firm a reference to the Political Agent is necessary before a visa can be granted. There are no hotels of European standard in any of the Gulf States and applicants for visas may be asked what arrangements they have made for accommodation. Visas are not required for persons in transit by air through the Gulf States. CHAPTER II.—BAHREIN Bahrein consists of a group of small low-lying islands situated half-way down the Persian Gulf some 20 miles off the eastern coast of Arabia. The largest island which is known as Bahrein Island is about 30 miles long and 10 miles wide at its broadest. The northern end and a strip along the western coast are well watered and fertile and the rest of the island is desert. The two most important towns are Manamah and Muharraq. The latter is situated on a separate island which is connected with the main island by a causeway two miles long. Manamah is the main business centre and the Political Agency is situated there. The Residency at Jufair, His Highness the Sheikh’s palace at Rifa’a, and the Oil Company’s camp at Awali are at distances of 4, 9 and 11 miles respectively from Manamah. All these places are connected by good roads and anyone making a long stay on the Island&amp; 3 will find it useful to have his own car as there are no public bus services and taxis are expensive. The population of the islands is estimated at 105,000 souls. The population of Muharraq Island is mostly Arab, but that of Manamah is extremely mixed. In addition to Arabs of varying origin including a number from Nejd, many Persians and a fair number of Indians are found there. The villages ’on the main island are mostly inhabited by Bahama, cultivators of the date gardens who speak Arabic but are of the Shiah faith. The Sheikh rules personally and is assisted by a British Adviser who performs the functions of Chief Minister. The State has a number of other British employees and is being gradually developed on modern lines. There are about 800 British, European and American subjects on the island. Of these the majority reside in the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s camp at Awali and most of the rest in Manamah. The R.A.F. have a small detachment on Muharraq Island. His Majesty’s Ships pay frequent visits to Jufair. The Political Resident and the Political Agent keep calling books in which visitors to Bahrein who desire to meet them can enter their names His Highness the Sheikh does not keep a calling book. Officials in the employment of His Majesty’s Government wishing to call on him should make arrangements through the Political Agent. The Bahrein Petroleum Company which operates the oilfields and refinery on the island has its headquarters in Awali and Messrs. Petroleum Con cessions Limited, who are operating at Qatar and elsewhere in the Gulf, have their head office in Manamah. The Eastern Bank and Imperial Bank of Iran have branches in Manamah. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie have a large office in Manamah and handle most of the shipping. Bahrein exports only oil and pearls, but is an entrepot for trade with other .Gulf States and with Saudi Arabia. The dates grown are insufficient for local needs and apart from these practically all the necessities of life have to be imported. Bahrein is the terminus for a weekly B.O.A.C. service from the United Kingdom. In addition 6 services between the United Kingdom on the one hand and India, the Far East and Australia on the other, call at Bahrein in each direction per week. Iraqi Airways land-planes flying between Bagdad and Karachi call at Bahrein once a week in each direction. The sea-plane anchorage is off the north-east corner of the main island and the land aerodrome is on Muharraq Island. The British India Steam NavigatiPn Company fast mail services call fortnightly in each direction and slow mail steamers also call. By fast mail steamer the journey from Bombay to Bahrein takes about 6 days, from Karachi to Bahrein 4 days and from Basra to Bahrein 2 days. There are also direct sailings between the United Kingdom and Bahrein by cargo steamers of the Strick Line which carry a few passengers. The British India Steam Navigation Company steamers anchor a few miles off Manamah, while other lines usually call at Sitra where the Bahrein Petroleum Company have a wharf for ocean-going vessels. Messrs. Cable and Wireless have an office in Manamah and deal with all telegraphic correspondence. There is a post office in Manamah and British stamps surcharged “ Bahrein ” and with rupee values are used. Air mails are received and despatched almost daily and letters take from 5 to 7 days between addresses in Bahrein and the United Kingdom. The surface mail is most irregular and letters and parcels may take from two to three months to arrive. Bahrein is in the sterling area and the currency ordinarily used is the Indian rupee. The climate of the Gulf is notorious. In Bahrein it is exceedingly hot and damp from May till October, though during most of June the heat is usually moderated by a strong north wind. July, August and September are the worst months. The temperatures rarely rise above 104 degrees on the coast and 115 degrees in the middle of the island but the humidity oftenexceeds 90 per cent. For about two months from towards the end of Decem ber till towards the end of February, the weather is extremely pleasant and sometimes quite cold, the temperature having been known to drop as low as 40 degrees. For the rest of the year the weather is hot but not unpleasantly so. The annual rainfall is from two to three inches a year. Its incidence is very irregular but it is most likely to occur in December and January. Accommodation can occasionally be had in the B.O.A.G. Rest House but it is usually fully occupied by passengers stopping the night there. Generally speaking therefore nothing in the nature of hotel accommodation is available in Bahrein for European and American visitors and they should make sure before they leave that they have a house to stay in or friends who will put them up. Local servants are obtainable. A house boy will cost at least Rs. 80 a month and a cook probably Rs. 100 or more. Servants are not provided with food but their employer is expected to get them clothes to wear when on duty in the house. In most cases they live out in their homes in the town. No woman servants are employed except as nurses, but women who are suitable for taking charge of European children are not easy to find. No servants should be employed without previous reference to the Bahrein Police and it is advisable to have them vetted by a doctor. Generally speaking all necessary food supplies can be obtained in Manamah. Meat and fish are usually plentiful and poultry is procurable. There is little fresh fruit apart from fresh dates, melons and papayas in their season but green vegetables are usually available and in the winter most European vege tables are procurable. Fresh milk is generally obtainable in Manamah but preserved milk is used exclusively at Awali. The shops stock supplies of tinned goods of all description. Cooking is done mainly on oil stoves. Oil coke, a product of the oil refinery, is used for heating water and for fires in the houses. The local water is slightly brackish and when first drunk has the effect of a mild dose of salts. Distilled water can be purchased locally. Bahrein is a Muslim state and officially “ dry ” but Europeans and Americans are allowed to purchase or import liquor for their own use. Liquor is sold by Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and is cheap as the Customs duty is low but permits to purchase have to be obtained from the Political Agent. The Manamah bazaar is well stocked and most of the necessities of life can be purchased there. In the summer, men usually wear open-necked shirts and slacks or shorts and light tropical suits on formal occasions. In the evening white open- necked short-sleeved shirts, white trousers, black shoes and socks and, on formal occasions, a black cummerbund are usually worn. A thin black or white dinner jacket is required for official dinner parties in the hot weather and for more ordinary occasions in the intermediate seasons. Aertex or cellular day shirts are the most suitable as they absorb sweat. Silk is not suitable for wear next to the skin in very hot weather as it becomes damp and creases. Light brown leather or suede shoes or sandals are usually worn and can be obtained locally. Sun helmets are only worn by men who are liable to be out in the sun all day. In the cold weather ordinary tweed suits are worn or flannel trousers and sports coats; dinner jackets are used in the evening. It is cold enough for pullovers and overcoats to be required. One good lounge suit is required for formal occasions. Material for both summer and winter suitings and for shirts can be obtained in the bazaar and local tailors are available who are reasonably good Almost every thing that is required in the way of clothing can be obtained in the bazaar Washing frocks preferably cotton are the best wear for women in the very hot weather. Light fiocks are usually worn from April till December and three or four linen or cotton evening dresses are essential for the hot weather. Hats5 are rarely worn but are required on some occasions such as official parties. It is not necessary to wear stockings in the summer. In the cold season, women require the type of clothes that are worn in England in April and May with the addition of a really warm coat, some afternoon frocks and a few dinner frocks. Material can be obtained and clothes made in the bazaar. Clothes are generally washed by Indian dhobies or washermen who keep them for a week and on the whole wash them quite well. On the whole, Bahrein is fairly free from tropical diseases though a certain amount of dysentery is prevalent. Visitors to Bahrein should be vaccinated and should be inoculated for T.A.B. as smallpox and typhoid sometimes occur. Prickly heat which is liable to develop into boils is very prevalent in the hot weather. The use of salt tablets is recommended during the worst months to prevent heat exhaustion. There is nothing to shoot in Bahrein except a few snipe, and the import of arms and ammunition is forbidden. The import of dogs is also prohibited unless the owner can produce a certificate from a qualified veterinary surgeon to the effect that the dog has been inoculated with anti-rabies vaccine as Bahrein is free from rabies. Members of the Gymkhana Club at Manamah can use the golf course, tennis courts and swimming pool. There is good sea bathing at some places on the coast though in the summer the water becomes too hot to be pleasant; there is no danger from sharks. There is fairly good sea fishing to be had and some people own sailing boats. Cricket is played regularly in the cold weather. There is no public library and no newspaper of any kind is published. English books and newspapers can be purchased in some of the shops. There is a Catholic church with a resident priest in Manamah and a mission church of the Dutch Reformed Church of America. Anglican services are held occasionally by visiting Chaplains. Bahrein is in the diocese of the Anglican Bishopric in Jerusalem. The language in Bahrein is Arabic but in the towns a good deal of Persian and some Hindustani is spoken. Most of the leading shop-keepers speak English. Friday is observed as the weekly holiday by the Bahrein Government, the Political Agency, the Oil Company, the banks and most institutions on the island. At the Residency, Sunday is still observed as the weekly holiday. There is no income-tax in Bahrein and the only form of taxation to which a visitor would ordinarily be liable is customs duty upon goods imported from abroad. The rates are 5 per cent, ad valorem on all foodstuffs and necessities, 10 per cent, on non-essential imports and 15 per cent, on tobacco and liquor. Worn personal effects are not liable to duty. CHAPTER ffl.—KOWEIT Koweit lies at the north-west corner of the Gulf and is roughly a square 90 miles in each direction indented by a bay. It is bounded on the east by the sea, on the north and west by Iraq and on the south by Saudi Arabia with a small area at the south-east which has not been apportioned either to Koweit or Saudi Arabia and is described as a Neutral Zone. There is one town, Koweit, where the great majority of the population live. Apart from this there are only a few small villages. There are small gardens adjoining some of the villages, but generally speaking the Sheikhdom consists of waterless desert. The rainfall averages from 5 to 6 inches a year and when there are adequate and timely winter rains the desert affords good grazing and is visited by nomad tribes from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 35669 B 2The population is much more truly Arab than that of Bahrein but in Koweit town there are a number of Persians and a few Indians The Sheikh rules personally with the assistance of other members of his family. He has no British Advisers. Health and education are under local committees presided over by .members of his family and Egyptian and Syrian doctors and school masters are employed. . Europeans and Americans number about 500 and these are mostly in the employ of the Koweit Oil Company. Social activities are much the same as in Bahrein. The Political Agent keeps a calling book. Calls on the Sheikh should be arranged by officers of His Majesty’s Government through the Political Agent and by others through the Sheikh s Secretary. There is a landing ground at Koweit kept up by the Koweit Oil Company and a daily service between Koweit and Basra is maintained by Iraqi Airways. B O A C on the United Kingdom-Bahrein service, call at Koweit twice a week in each direction. B.I.S.N. fast and slow mails call regularly. Basra, which is 110 miles away, can be reached by a bad road which becomes impassable after rain There is no bus service but cars can be hired for the journey at considerable expense. Messrs. Cable and Wireless maintain a telegraph office at Koweit and there is a British post office. British stamps surcharged “ Koweit ” and with rupee values are used. The local currency is Indian ruoccs The Koweit Oil Company which is half British and half American came into production in 1946 and its activities are rapidly expanding. Its head offices are in Koweit but a new camp is under construction 20 miles south at Ahmadi and the oil is shipped from Fahahil a few miles to the east of Ahmadi. There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran at Koweit and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie maintain an office there. The main industry of the place is ship building and apart from this and oil the place thrives chiefly on its entrepot trade. The general conditions are similar to those in Bahrein. The climate is a little less humid and temperatures are lower in the winter. The dust can be very trying especially when the wind is blowing from the north. The local water is too brackish even for the inhabitants and drinking water is imported by country craft from the Shatt-al-Arab. Fresh fruit and vegetables have to be imported for the greater part of the year and are much harder to obtain than at Bahrein. Apart from this most of the necessities of life can be obtained in the bazaar but prices are higher than at Bahrein and servants’ wages are also higher. There are some reasonably good tailors and clothes can be made locally. There is no hotel and generally speaking Europeans and Americans have to rely upon either the Political Agent or the Oil Company for accommodation. The Oil Company and the American Mission maintain hospitals and His Majesty’s Government and the State small dispensaries. The Oil Company have a resident Roman Catholic priest and the Dutch Reformed Church maintain a place of worship in the American Mission. There are a few tennis courts in Koweit and there is sea bathing but no fresh water swimming bath. Except for a few sand grouse in the desert there is little shooting to be had locally but duck and snipe shooting can be had at Basra. CHAPTER IV.—QATAR Qatar is an ungainly peninsula on the Arabian mainland about 100 miles long and averaging 30 miles in width. It is almost waterless and consists largely of low barren hills. The only town of any importance is Dohah on the east coast where there is a fairly extensive bazaar. The Sheikh lives at Riyan a few miles inland. The total population of the peninsula is onlyI about 16,000 and consists mostly of miscellaneous Arabs who before the adyent of the Oil Company obtained their living from pearl diving. The Oil Company maintain a landing strip but there is no air or steamer service to the peninsula and access to it is normally had by launch from Bahrein by way of either Zakrit, the Oil Company’s present port on the west coast or by Dohah. The Oil Company—Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited—has its headquarters at Dukhan near the west coast of the peninsula. Oil has been lound but the Company’s operations have not yet reached the production stage. The climate is similar to that of Bahrein except that it is slightly less humid. There are no amenities other than those provided by the Oil Company. The American Mission have recently opened a dispensary at Dohah. There are no postal and telegraph facilities. CHAPTER V.—TRUCIAL COAST The Trucial Coast is the name given to the low-lying open coast stretching from the base of the Qatar peninsula on its eastern side up to the hills of the ^ Musandam peninsula a short way beyond Ras al Khaimah. Before 1820, the coast was known as the Pirate Coast and it is now known as the Trucial Coast because the Sheikhdoms situated on it have undertaken to observe a perpetual truce with each other and the world at large on the sea. In Arabic the coast is known as the “ Sahil Oman ” or the Oman Coast. The number of Trucial Sheikhdoms was originally 5 and owing to the splitting up of the Sheikhdom of Sharjah has become 7. Of the 7 Sheikhdoms the most westerly, Abu Dhabi, is by far the largest and is the most powerful tribally but the area it covers is mostly desert and its capital, Abu Dhabi, is; difficult of access. The next Sheikhdom proceeding in a north-easterly direction is Dubai. This Sheikhdom does not cover a very large area but the town is the largest on the coast and said to possess 38,000 inhabitants. There is a large and well-stocked bazaar and the Imperial Bank of Iran and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie have branches here, and Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), Limited, who are prospecting for oil on the Trucial Coast, have an office. His Majesty’s Government maintain a dispensary under an Indian doctor. There is a British post office where British stamps surcharged with rupee values only are used. The B.I.S.N. slow mail steamers make irregular calls. Dubai is the main centre of supply for the whole of the Trucial Coast and its hinterland and there is much trade by country craft with Persia. There are no local products and Dubai depends for its existence on its entrepot trade and pearl diving. The next Sheikhdom is Sharjah which has lost much of its former glory r owing to the bulk of its territory having been formed into independent Sheikhdoms and the silting up of its creek which has ruined it as a commercial centre. The Political Officer and the Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, have their headquarters here. The Political Officer, who is British, normally resides here only during the cold weather. During the hot weather the Residency Agent, who is an Arab, is responsible to the Political Agent, Bahrein, for dealings with the Sheikhdoms. There is an aerodrome here maintained by a detachment of the R.A.F. and a Rest House which is staffed by the B.O.A.C. Accommodation for visitors is usually available in this Rest House. The B.O.A.C. maintain a telegraph service for the public acting as agents of Cable and Wireless. An Iraqi Airways service between Bagdad and Karachi calls at Sharjah once weekly in each direction. R.A.F. aircraft from Shaibah and Bahrein also visit Sharjah once or twice a week and official visitors canoften obtain passages to and from Sharjah in these. B.I.S.N. slow mail steamers call at Sharjah irregularly. The next two Sheikhdoms are Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwam. At Ras- al-Khaimah there is an emergency alighting base for flying-boats. There are fairly extensive date gardens in the sub-montane area of this Sheikhdom and much of the country is covered with natural vegetation. The last Sheikhdom, Kalba, is situated beyond the hills on the Gulf of Oman. Climatic conditions on the Trucial Coast are similar to those at Bahrein. There are certain facilities available at Dubai and Sharjah as described above but apart from this the Sheikhdoms are undeveloped. Chapter VI.—MUSCAT The territory under the sway of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman includes a sea-board of over a thousand miles from the Musandam peninsula to Ras Durbat Ali where the province of Dhofar borders on the Aden Protectorate. He also exercises sovereignty over Gwadur on the Mekran coast and a small strip of territory around it which borders on Kalat State. The bulk of the country consists of bare hills but there is a fertile strip for about 150 miles along the Batinah Coast north of Muscat where there is a chain of date gardens. There are many fertile oases in the Oman hills the produce of which finds its way to the coast and in Dhofar which receives the monsoon rains there are groves of coconut palms, millet and sugar cane crops are grown and the frankincense tree is found amongst the hills. The only towns of any size are the ports of Muscat, Matrah and Gwadur and Matrah which is the biggest of these contains less than 9,000 inhabitants. The population of Muscat and Matrah is very mixed and includes a large number of Indians both Hindus and Khojas, aad Baluchis. There are many Baluchis on the Batinah Coast but elsewhere the population is mostly Arab. The bulk of the Arabs in Oman including the Sultan and his relatives are neither Sunni nor Shiah but belong to the Ibadhi sect of Mohammedans. At Gwadur there is a wealthy colony of followers of the Aga Khan and the rest of the inhabitants are mostly Baluchis. The Sultan who can speak English well has his seat of government at Muscat. He exercises control through numerous Walis or Governors located in different parts of his dominions. He possesses a force of about 300 trained men, mostly Baluchis, known as the Muscat Infantry under a British Com mandant. It is stationed at Bait-al-Falaj about 5 miles from Muscat. The representative of His Majesty’s Government resides at Muscat and is represented at Gwadur by an Indian clerk who is known as the British Agent. The British community at Muscat is a small one and rarely exceeds 10 persons. The American Dutch Reformed Church Mission maintains a doctor at Matrah and a pastor at Muscat. Two American ladies, one of whom previously belonged to the Mission, run a dispensary on the Batinah Coast. All these Americans usually spend two or three months of the hot weather in India. There is less social life generally than at Bahrein and Koweit but more mixing with local communities and there is a club at which Europeans, State officials including members of the Sultan’s family, and Indians meet. Tennis and bridge are played. B.I.S.N. slow mail steamers call at Muscat in each direction once a fortnight. There is a landing ground at Bait-al-Falaj but it cannot be used by most modern types of aircraft and there is no air service. There are aerodromes maintained by small detachments of the R.A.F. at Salalah inDhofar and on Masirah Island. R.A.F. aircraft from Aden visit these aerodromes from time to time but they are not used by any regular air service. Cable and Wireless maintain a cable station at Muscat and there is a post office there. There is a post and telegraph office at Gwadur, and telegrams are sent by land line via Panjgur in Makran to Karachi. There is a rest house at Gwadur where travellers can stay but there is no cook. The local currency in Muscat and Oman proper is the Maria Theresa dollar and this is the only coin current in the interior. Indian rupees are also current in Muscat town and Matrah and elsewhere on the coast and are the sole currency at Gwadur. The exchange rate between the Maria Theresa dollar and the rupee varies. Before the war the rupee was worth slightly more than the dollar but at present the rate is over two rupees to the dollar. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie have a branch at Muscat and there is a fish meal factory run by a local Khoja at Matrah. Dates, dried fish and fish meal are exported to India and elsewhere. At present there is no bank at Muscat. Oil Companies subsidiary to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, hold prospecting licences for the whole of the Sultan’s dominions excluding Gwadur but no oil has yet been found. The climate is more severe than at Bahrein and warm clothes *are only occasionally needed. The heat at Muscat in the early summer and autumn is intense. It is sometimes moderated during August by monsoon winds from the south. Very little rain falls on the coast. The main bazaar is at Matrah where local produce can be obtained and there are one or two shops in Muscat where a limited amount of imported groceries can be purchased. Other requirements have to be obtained from Bahrein or India. Local sanitation is almost non-existent and dysentery is prevalent. Malaria is pre valent wherever there is cultivation. The British Government maintain a medical officer at Muscat who is in charge of the quarantine arrangements and a local dispensary, and medical assistance can also be obtained from the American Mission hospital at Matrah. There is no State medical service. There is good sea bathing to be had when the water is not infested with jelly fish and the sea never becomes as hot as it does at Bahrein. The gardens on the Batinah Coast are full of partridge and there are some duck and geese to be had on the small creeks along this coast and in Dhofar. CHAPTER VIL—LOCAL CUSTOMS Generally speaking the inhabitants of the Gulf States are extremely polite and courteous to European and American visitors. When a visitor enters an Arab house he is ordinarily offered coffee in a small cup without handles. Not more than three cups should be taken at a time. On returning the cup to the servant it should be shaken when it is desired to show that no more is required. When seated on the ground it is considered rude to point the soles of one’s feet towards any other person in the gathering. Shorts should not be worn when calling on a person of any consequence as it is considered impolite to show the knees, and ladies should wear stockings. An Arab meal is normally eaten on the ground without knives and forks, though spoons are often provided. It should be remembered that food should only be handled with the right hand. Water is always offered for washing the hands both before and after the meal. In most of the Gulf States, rose-water and incense are passed round at the conclusion of a visit as a sign for the guest to leave. CHAPTER VIIL—NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES India and Pakistan .—The Gulf States are linked to India and Pakistan by old commercial ties, and B.I.S.N. steamers maintain regular services with Bombay and Karachi. British Political Officers in the' Gulf are responsibleM jyc&gt; 10 for the welfare of the subjects of both Dominions and are empowered to grant visas to travellers visiting them. Saudi Arabia—Launches of the Arabian American Oil Company ply constantly between Manamah in Bahrein and A1 Khobar, a distance of about 20 miles. The Oil Company has its headquarters at Dhahran a few miles inland from A1 Khobar. Goods for Saudi Arabia imported via Bahrein are mostly carried by country craft to Oqair. The desert route between Koweit and Riyadh is passable by motor vehicles and goods are carried over it by both lorry and camel. The Saudi Arabian Government maintains unofficial Trade Agents at both Bahrein and Koweit. Visas for Saudi Arabia cannot be obtained in any of the Gulf States but the Arabian American Oil Company sometimes make arrangements for travellers from Bahrein visiting the mainland under their auspices to be given visas on landing. There is a Saudi Arabian Consul at Basra. Iraq .—There is constant communication between the Gulf States and Iraq by sea and air and so far as Koweit is concerned by land. British Political Officers in the Gulf are empowered to grant visas for Iraq. Visitors to the Gulf States travelling via Iraq should be careful to arm themselves with vaccination and inoculation certificates in accordance with the regulations in force in the country at the time, otherwise they may be delayed.
