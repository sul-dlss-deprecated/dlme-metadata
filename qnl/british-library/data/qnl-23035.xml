I enclose,a statement of the issue of fees stamps during the quarterSj March* June and September of this year‘showing the issues ^6 Muscat and to the Bahrain Court* and the balance in stock in the Agency at the 30th September 1949. 3../ The issues to the Bahrain Court can be reconciled with the accounts submitted to the Foreign Office as follows ?-* a) March Quarter: The new issue of fee stamps replaced the Government of India fee stamps in February. The Item of Court fees in the accounts amounting to Hs*2*670*4-0 refers to the fees collected before the receipt of the new stamps. Fees collected against the new stamps appear imder the title ^Proceeds of Court fee stamps sold w amounting to Bs.4*047. There is a discrepancy of Bs.3-8-0 between this figure and the stamps issued* explained by a payment made by the Residency in respect of a fee collected but for which no stamp was cancelled. b) June Quarter: There is a discrepancy of Bs.688-6-0 between the fees shown in the accounts and the issues of fee stamps. This is due to the practice followed in the past of cancelling stamps only in respect of Court fees paid* and not for Court fines. There is one item of Bs.688-6-0 in the cash book* where it was not made clear whether the payment was for fees or for fines, and when the accountant made up the account* he included it as fees when it should .in fact have been included with the fines. e) September Quarter: The statement agrees with the accounts. 4. This however takes no account of the fact that the Court holds a stock of uncancelled stamps for daily use* which does not appear in the statement of the balance on hand. This has been made possible by the fact that on the day that the new Court stamps were introduced* the Court held Hs.758-8 In cash. On the first morning, they exchanged this sum in cash for fee stamps* and this money appeared as part of the Bs.4*047 figuring in the March quarter account, instead of figuring either as fines or fees belonging to the previous period. In other words* if we try to reconcile the total fees collected since February and the total fee stamps held both in the Agency and in the Court* there is a surplus of Bs.758-8-0* performing the functions in the Court Office of **Petty Cash 5 * * * * * 11 * and usually partly in the form of cash and partly In stamps. 5. This discrepancy is clearly confusing, unnecessary, and bad practice. I have therefore arranged that in future fee stamps will be issued to the Court in the same way as Consular fee stamps are issued to the passport office, fees will be paid to the accountant in the same way* and form H will be submitted in the same way, taking into account both the stock on hand in the Court and the bulk stock in the 4 Agency. In order to do this* the discrepancy must be resolved. At the moment of writing* the Court holds Es. 372-13-0Es*372-13-0 in cash and Es«385-11-0 In stamps* He will to-day surrender both to the Agency. Accordingly, on the H form for the December quarter, there will appear under stamps received the item, 'Received from the Court (see Agency letter No*F-108-4/64 of 12th November) Es*38S-*ll-0* tt In the Accounts for the December Quarter there will appear an Item 'Additional Court fees (see Agency letter lfo*F~108-4/54 of 12th November) Bs* 372-13-0' 6# Would you please now send out as rapidly as possible a Daily Record of Fee Stamps book for use in the Court? 7* There will be the further point that in the middle of October, Jakins discovered that stamps were not being cancelled in respect of Court fines $ and accordingly he gave orders that henceforth this was to be done* The sum of Ks*465. had already been collected as fines during the quarter, and this will appear as a separate Item in the accounts as 'Court Fines 1st to 22nd October Ks*466.' For the rest, Court Fees for the whole quarter and Court Fines for the renfiLnder of the quarter will appear under one heading'Court Receipts' and will, I hope, agree with the amount of fee stamps cancelled as it will appear on the form H* 8* I trust that the position is now straightened and that it will continue to remain so* -4 Co pljl ffc Mnance Department ^woreign Office, l / London. |g|gl;: | % lj|'.

In view of the largeness of the sum and the non-availability of higher denomination stamps in the 'Court Fee Stamps' held by us (the highest denomination being only fis.,20/-), we have not cancelled any fee stamps for this item. We are crediting the amount to the 'Fine Account.' The amount will be added to the sum of Bs.465/- mentioned in paragraph 7 of our letter No.F-108-4/54 of 12th November and will be shown in the December Quarter Account as 'Court Fines collected from 1st to 22nd October and on 3rd December, 1949 * fis.20,282-4-0' The Finance Department, Foreign Office, London.

With reference to your letter F«129-^/54 dated 4th Decemher, 1949 we note that you are bringing to account a credit of ,Rs. 19,817-4-0 in respect of a court fine without cancelling any Court Fee stamps. 2. As you no doubt'realise this action is not in line ^with correct accounting procedure but it is appreciated that it is the only action you could take in view of the fact that the higher denomination stamp you have is Rs. 20 . 3. As a result of this however, would you please review the size of fines you collect and submit a recuest for large denomination stamps (overprinted in Rupees) in order to cover them.
