Hal Bahadur Gokhaldas Khemji, wealthy merchant of Muscat, has been approached by Ilian Baliadur fcirza Muhammad Ahmad (former Persian now Iraqi subject) and Dr. Puransingh (renegade olkh now Iraqi subject), both of Basra, to Invest capital in, and accept Directorship of Bank which they ore promoting to be called 'India and Persian Gulf Bank Limited'. Proposed initial capital is five lakhs of Rupees, Bead Office of Bank is to be in India under direction of Puransinr^s brother and branches are proposed to be opened in Dubai, Kuwait and possibly Muscat. As the Kai Bahadur has been asked to communicate his acceptance to the Agricultural Credit Department of the Reserve Bank of India Bombay some progress appears to have been made in India. 3. Under Article 18 (b) of his agreement with the Imperial Bank of Iran (Residency Printed Letter No. 111-D 24th January 1B42) Bhaikh has given that bank monopoly until end of 1956. Under Article 25 of Dubai Oil Concession Bhaikh of Dubai is obliged to consult Petroleum Concessions Limited before according permission for a bank to open a branch at Dubai. In correspondence linked with his acceptance of political agreement between His Majesty's Government £ and Company relating to Concession Shaikh has undertaken to seek approval of Ills Majesty's Government before entering into negotiations with any bank. 4. In view of position given in paragraph 3 above, and prims facie general undesirability of establishment of bank in Persian Gulf with Iraqi capital and direction I should be glad of any Information ascertainable in India (a) generally and (b) as to extent of Indian interests involved.

It is regretted lhit, due to an error of procedure, the consent of the Gov rn .out of India under Rule 94 A of the Defence of India Rules to the iosue of capital for this ban! was granted without cot suiting you. It will be seen from the enclosed croies of correspondence between the Government of India, Finance Department, and the Reserve Bank of India that application fer capital fer the floatation of this ban! was nude at the end of last year, and that ulie Reserve Bank of India’s ec nmencation in favour of issuing the capital, on the strength of which i the Government of India acted, was based on purely financial criteria, in respeot ' f which the rrooosals appeared unobjectionable.

It should meanwhile jc pointed out that consent to the issue of tins capital mder Rule 94 A c.f tie Defence of India Rules does not in any way prejudice the subsequent attitude of the GcveTvr ent of India to tl.e operations of tiie bank and in particular to the establish ment of branches in Dubai, Kuwait, Muscat and elsewhere. Should the bank wish to open branches at any of these places its requests will be dealt with on their merits and the fact that it has been allowed to issue capital 'V 0in India will not affect the decision in any case The issue of the ab:»ve has been authorised.

With reference to your letter No.D 7103-F.I./45 of the 19th June *45, the promoters of the India and Persian Gu^f Bank Ltd., made an application towards the end of last year for the necessary permission to make an Issue of capital which was referred to us for our recommendations by the Examiner of Capital Issues. It was stated in the application that the Bank will engage in the business of financing trade between India, Iraq, Iran and the Middle East countries A generally, and would be meeting a greatly felt need, banking facilities being rare in those territories. After making the necessary enquiries with regard to the promoters of -ed the Bank, we recommend-.that permission may be granted for the issue of capital to the extent of 10,000 ordinary shares of the face value of EsQLOO/- each, at least 50 per cent paid up, provided that the head office of the Bank is established at Karachi. We were unable to recommend permission being given for the Bank to have its head office in Bombay which is already overcrowded in the matter of banking offices. A copy of our letter to the Assistant Examiner of Capital Issues in this connection is enclosed herewith. Our recommendation to Government on the application was given on its merits as a financial proposition having regard to the relevant criteria laid down by Government for purposes of the control of capital issues in terms of Defence of India Rule 94-A. Our recom endation did not take cognizance 1 nor were we aware, of considerations such as those advancedy in paras 3 and 4 of the telegram from Galloway Bushire. Reference is made in para 4 to the bank being incorporated with Iraqi capital and direction* This seems to be only partially correct as although we have nc information as to the relative distribution of its share capital between Indian and non-resident share-holders, a majority of its Board of Directors will be Indians and it is presumed a substantial proportion (f its share capital will be held by Indians* As the considerations referred to in Galloway's telegram are of a political character, we do not consider ourselves competent to tender advice with regard thereto except in so far as they concern the methods of financing the trade of ) India with these countries* TV is^trade is at present financed largely by primitive methods* e.g* by remittances of cash in the form of notes and coin, or the drawing ofdrafts and hundies by private merchants and firms, as bankingfacilities on modern lines are lacking in these areas* In so far as the institution proposed tobe set up will aim at supplying thi^ need and thereby contribute to the development of the trade of India withthese countries, there could be no objection, on financial and economic grounds to its establishment* Copy of D.O No* iiCD/703/BS.

Our opinion on the application of the India and Persian Gulf Bank Ltd. (proposed) is as below* The enclosures to your letter ^re returned herewith* THK UnDI.. GULF PivKK UP. BOMBAX . 1. Proposed JAuthorised? 10,000 ordinary shares of Ss 100/- each Es 10,00,000 Proposed Issue: 10,000 ordinary shares of Es 100/- each Bs 10,00,000 (Rs7,00,000 paid up) It is proposed to start a bank as a private limited co pany at Bombay with an authorised capital of Rs 10 lakhs divided I into 10,000 shares of Es 100/-each# The promoters are willing to have the head office at Karachi and a branch at Bombay, if there is any objection to the bank being allowed to have its head office at the latter place. It is stated that the business between India and Iraq, Iran and the Middle East countries has grown considerably and that after the war it may increase further. It is also stated that banking facilities in these countries are limited and the establishment need of the proposed bank will not only fulfil a very deeply felt/ but will also bo very much appreciated by the commercial community trading between India and the Persian Gulf countries. The objects clause of the draft Memorandum of Association is generally on the lines of Section 277 F of the Indian Companies Act. l-hder clause 66 of the articles of Association every share carries one vote and as all the shares are of one class and will be \;niformly called up, voting rights will bo equitable. Under clause 69 the number of directors is not to be less than two or more than seven. Under clause 71 Ur. Puran Singh shall be the Chairman of the directors so long as he remains a director and holds in his own name or in the names of his nominees 25$f&gt; of the share capital of the company. Under clause 76 his remuneration shall be Tt 6,000/- per annum. Clause 89 provides for the appoint ment of Dr. Puran Singh as the first Managing Director of the nank for a period of five years v/ith a monthly allowance of not less than Es 600/-. Under clause 90 the Managing Director will be tin ex-officio Director and will not be subject to retirement by rotation. It appears from the applicati( n and from the information we have received from cthe bank *5 solicitors that the number of the proposed directors A u! is nine (4 from Basrah and 5 from India) which would violate clause 69 of the bank , s Articles of Association. Killer the number of the proposed directors will have to be reduced or , J the clause will have to be amended. The four directors from Basra are stated to be very influential and one of them, Mr. Peter D*Souza, is at present the Manager of the Imperial Bak of Iran, at Koweit, and is stated to have banking experience since 1919. Uhder clause 70 of the Articles of Association, Khan Bahadur Mlrza Muhamned, Dr. Puran Singh and Mr. Sehh Abdul Hussain Haji Nur Mohammed will be the first Directors of the company unless otherwise determined by the company ) at a General Meeting and will not be liable to retire by rotation or to be removed from office by an extraordinary resolution. According to the information supplied by the Solicitors the following five are the proposed directors from India: (1) Mr. Haji hur Mohammed. He is a Managing Partner of Huji Jethabhai Gokal &lt;$k Co. which is carrying on business as General Merchants, (2) Mr. iioosabhoy Ebrahim Khetani, Cutcli (Bhuj), an export and import genen 1 and provision merchant with business connections in Bagdad and Basrah. On enquiry Mr. Khetan has informed us that he is * unable to be a director owing to ill-health but is interested in the proposed bank. (3) Mr Mohindar Singh Behr, Hohtak, a senior prosecuting Sub-Inspector of Police. (4) Rai Bahadur Gol-aldas, Merchant and Financer, Cutch, Mandvi. (5) Mr Malik Shankerlal B.B., LL.B., Manager Messrs Malik &lt;&amp; Co., Lahore. The confidential reports which we have obtained on the proposed directors indicate that they have sufficient means for the issuo of the capital applied for and they have either already agreed to join it as promoter directors or are other wise interested in its establishment. Besides, there appears to be scope for a well managed bank for financing trade between India and Persian Gulf countries. We, there- 4 .5 fore, reconmend that the bank may be permitted to issue 10,000 ordinary shares of Rs.100/- each, to be at least ) 5Cv? oaid up, of the total face value of Ks.10 lakhs provided that the head office of the bank is established at Karachi# We are unable to recommend a new bank with . its head office at Bombay which is already overcrowded.Dated the 9th received the 10th October, 1945 H Paragraph 3 of your telegram S 1129 August 19th.

(b) the Imperial Bank of Ira^s familiarity with trade on both sides of the Gulf.

(d) the advantage of having branches of the same concern along the Arab side. (e) the fact that due to their experience in Persia the staff of this bank are equipped with more than usual political acunen for dealings in an area like the Trucial Coast. 2. Imperial Bank of Iran will have to be warned of the Sultan of Muscat's $nd Shaikh of Dubai's obligation under the Oil Concessions to consult Petroleum Concessions Limited before granting a banking concession.

Dear Colonel Hay, *»oiilu you please refer to your d«af-official letter No,C/994, dated the 3 rd 194*6. regarding the co&amp;cneroial prospect 8 for a bank at liuscat? 2 . 1 Imagine that a bank would not be interested in establishing a branch unless it was assured of an income of not leas than Ra. 10 , 000 /- per month, or R«.l,20 f 000/- per annua. ity own view is that such an income would be forthcoming «t Muscat. 3. The main sources frc* which a &gt; rand’) of the Imperial hank of Iran would derive income at Muscat are presumably! (a) Tiie discounting of bills of exchange. (b) luoone from exchange tr?• nanctions. (c) The use of moneys deposited free of interest ty the filuacat Government. (d) Treasury r.vr&gt;&gt; on behalf of the Reserve: flank of India. (®) Income from private accounts including Petro leum Concessions Limited. 4. • sese ••• Tho Eonlble Lt.

This increase la not lik dy to fce maintaiiied for nore Ul/in two years or so; but given a mono)&gt;oly position, tlie Bank's expected inooroe on discounting bills of oxoI^Rg©, even on pix-war figures, would be considerable. Coiamunications with Muscat are likely to reroain poor arui the dlsoount r&amp;te will consequently be high, At present the discount rate of Indian Treasury notea against silver averages (b) Muscat's currency is silver and its value da- ? c j iv?rf on the price of silver coupled with a seasonal scarcity value during the rjurketing of the date crop. Hie iiational Bank of India, which is the principal, if not the only British bunk at Aden, does extencive business in the bt^ing and selling of dollars, and similar transactions would presurerbly be undertaken by any bank at Muses t. (c) It can be expected tiiat the Sultan will wiah to use the bank both for State purposes and for private transaetloti*..

(d) I am not aware of the terms under which the Imperial Bank of India act as Agents for the Reserve Bank of India in regard to Treasury and currency matters, but if the Imperial Bank of Iran were to e ct in a airdlar capacity at Muscat, they would be entitled to remuneration. It may he that the bank would consider the use of interest free Government moneys deposited with them a sufficient reward fai' such services. (e) It is 5jBpooaible for me to assess income derivable from private accounts, but most if not all trading houses and individuals of substance at Muscat would open accounts with the bank. 5* My own view is that a proper appreciation of the commercial prospects of a bank at Muscat o&amp;n only be undertaken by &amp; qualified representative of the bank Interested. I feel that the poanibilitioa fully Justify such an investigation and I hope that it will be possible to persuade the Imperial Bank of Iran to adhere to their original plan of tending s representative to Mueest In September or October. 6 . If the Imperial Bank of Irsn lose heart altogether, then I think it more than likely that the National Bank of India would be interested.

Khan Bahadur Mirza Mohammed obtained visa for Muscat from this Agency while I was on recess and had the records of the ’India and Persian Gulf Bank Ltd.” with me at Karachi. The Muscat office was therefore unaware of the purpose of the Khan Bahadur’s visit to Muscat, except that his application for a visa mentioned 'Trade”. Besides applying to this Agency for visa, the Khan Bahadur had also telegraphed His Highness the Sultan in this connection. Hi a Highness saw no objection to the Khan Bahadur being allowed to visit Muscat and when a reference was made to him by the Agency regarding the giant of a visa, he replied accordingly. 3- In order to avoid a recurrence of such matters,during the absence of the Political Agent on recess, instructions have been issued that in future all such cases should be referred to him for orders.

I send herewith a copy of a rough note which was handed to me at Muscat by Eyers of the Imperial Bank of Iran. 2. For the reasons given in the note he is recommending to his directors that a branch of the Bank should not be opened at Muscat* He has agreed that the Sultan should be informed accordingly and told that the Bank do not wish their option extended. 3. If you see no objection would you kindly inform the Sultan on the above lines. I suggest that he should be thanked for giving the Bank the opportunity of examining the situation and that the reasons for their not wishing to open a branch at Muscat at present should be explained to him. One of these, which is not mentioned in the note, is the uncertainty of the future in India, which is the country with which Muscat chiefly trades. Major A.C. Stewart, O.B.E., Political Agent, Muscat f NPG.MUSCAT Trade figures of last few years inflated by abnormal war-time conditions. Large proportion of imports re-exported (chiefly to Iran) — a state of affairs which is unlikely to continue. Total volume of normal trade insufficient— as far as can be foreseen — to justify the opening of a bank. Not more than about 20 reliable merchants in Muscat and Matrah 9 of whom two (Kimji and Bagher Abdul Latif) practically control the export trade. Business is largely with India and leading merchants have that so well organised and are so amply supplied with funds that they are unlikely to need the services of a bank for that side of their business. Only possibilities are connected with trade with other foreign countries and that is on too small a scale. Other possible difficultiess- 1) Division of business between Muscat and Matrah. Bank would presumably have to be in Muscat which would be inconvenient for Matrah merchants. 2) Difficulty of defining legal currency and necessity of operating in Rupees and silver dollars. 3) Silver currency controlled by His Highness who does not (at present) permit its export. 4) In view of prevailing double currency standard and control of silver by local Government, would Bank of England and Reserve Bank of India allow the Sultanate to be regarded as in the Sterling Area. N.B. Difficulty in this regard was experienced even as regards Dubai. 5) Poor communications both with outside world and the interior. The latter a big handicap to development of internal trade. 6) Smallness of adjacent population and their very low standard of living and small purchasing power. Populous fertile areas too far away. 7) Uncertainties regarding date markets abroad (on which local prosperity is so dependent) and on silver exchange rates which, owing to local factors, do not necessarily conform to world silver prices. Oil production development? This would vitally affect the situation. Would the State expect a revenue from the Bank? Would the State be prepared to grant exclusive banking rights for a period of at least 10 years? NPG.Telegram ^ Prom Political Resident, on H.LT.S.

Bank has informed me confidentially that the Imperial Bank of Iran are also proposing to send a representative to Muscat next month to consider further the possibility of opening' a branch there but up to date I have, heard nothing from them on the subject, and Johnson of the Imperial Bank of Iran with whom I discussed the situation at Muscat did not mention the possibility . Stewart, O.3.E., il Agent, I. C.ii.CONFIDENTIAL Political Agency &amp; H.Mfs Consulate, Muscat. D.O.No.C 148-14/14 dated the 11th March, 1948. Please refer to the correspondence on the subject of the opening of a branch of the Eastern Bank in Muscat. I told the Sultan that Mr .Findlay had visited Muscat and that though not greatly impressed at the prospect of business should the Bank open a branch here, he had finally after prolonged discussions with the merchants, decided to recommend to his Directors that they should send a represent ative to .Muscat to enter into negotations with him. I added that in view of the fact that the Agency Treasury ’..’as soon to be closed I had urged tfr.Findlay to persuade his Directors to move as quickly as possible. By and large I got the impress ion that the Sultan would welcome a Bank and would not be too difficult about granting a reasonable concession.

MUTTRAH* imttrah is a very dirty, smelly, fly-infested place situated about 3i tulloa free: Muscat to which it is joined by a rough and ready road constructed recently by tho Muscat Levies* Of the two towns, Muttra is the main merchant business centre but merchants who are able to do so maintain their4 - residence© In Muscat uhlch la nuch cleaner and less odlforous* Muttrah has no electricity wiiile Muscat ^x&gt;saesaea a oone*?hat unreliable service* Muttrah street a are very narrow - in most cases they are about 7 or 8 feet wide - and are roofed over by uattlng which, although having the effect of keeping the streets aorrsewliat cooler, does not help in joaddQMB purifying the atmosphere• Apart iron those merchants who reside at their business premises, no one stays in Muttrah if they can avoid It, though the Aiaerican Mission have their main hospital there and the American Doctors reside there for eight ronthr of the year, leaving it during the hottest season to live elsewhere* Disc ion maintains its own electric power and have installed their own modem sanitation. UVIIfG COKSITIQI&amp;. ?hi«cat has the reputation of being tho hottest place in the Persian Gulf, with May, June, and July as the three hottest months in the year, and sumnor clothing la worn from March to November* The heat is refloated off tho rocks during tlie night and there is little or no relief after siundown* There is a L-lectrlclty supply (jD*C ) in Muscat town only but it la very ^uor and rioot un reliable and can only endeavour to supply current between 6 p*n and 6 a.ra. The Agency has it© own generating plant ^hich supplies current to the houses of agency employees and certain others at a coat of 12 annas per unit* Govemnent have a new generator on order but it is not known when tills will bo delivered* Drinking water is obtained frou veils situated a few miles inland and is carried to the town inskins* A skinful of water per day about G gallons coats Ft? *6/- per month, which works out about | anna a gallon* Tho re is no modern water-borne sanitation In Muscat or in Muttra* The only hospital in Muscat is that maintained by the Agency under Dr* Matthew, I*!' *D* Dr* Matthew inf orris ;ie that Malaria is very prevalent, while people also suffer from the usual Persian Gulf complaints caused by the lack of the vitamins due to the absence of fresh fruit and vegetables during the eight months of }&gt;ot weather* The cost of living In Muscat is high as imports of food stuffs are sure difficult to obtain than in other Porelan Gulf Ports, the reason being said to be that, because of its limited anchorage, steamers prefer to carry cargoes for Porta with larger anchorages fur Ler up the Gulf and earn more freight I rather think tho freight earning anakau* factor is more Important than tho limited anchorage as in most other Gulf Port« while anchorage space my be more cor e tod lous, lighterage opera tions are as slow as in Muscat* It can be easily understood that Steamer services dn the Gulf would prefer to liave full cargoes from India to points well up tho Gulf than travel half-empty from 1 useat onwards* There appears to be aaple housing accommodation available both in Muscat and Futtrah and rents appear to b ble* p'rofci a purely business point of view, any Bank might open would perhaps be more appropriat in Muttrah as it is the main bus inos seentre but I would emphasise that there is no electricity in Kuttroh and that the5 atnoapher® there la not too pure at the beet of tinoa* I examined several building* in tfuttrah which were eivy eotod aa being suitable for office pi^niaea if tho x^anlc were to open a Branch but I cannot cajr I was favourably Inpreaaod witl-i any of them. They would require so much gror&gt;arjd floor alterations that it would, I consider, be almost ac cheap to build office premises according to our own arranneciants requirements. Two merchants offered to build accorditxg to our own plana but I did not go into details of what rent would be expected if thoy did so. X also had a look at a building in Fuacat, the old French Consulate building, which was recommended by tho Agency aa being suitable, with certain additions and alterations, for an Office and Manager’s residence. I do not think it would be vei^ suitable, however, as the roona are too narrow and nunoroms and suitable alterations for purposes of a Bank would not bo easy* There is, however, a plot of high land about 200 yards inland fron the Agency, which is on the Bea front, and which would bo most suitable for building premises and it would be near enough to tho sea to install modem sanitation without undue expense. I did not ascertain if the land could be leased but the political Agent thought there would be no difficulty in lofting'the plot if required* The Sultan does not allow to be Bold outright to foreigners, though he has no objection to their leasing it. During ray last interview with !tr« Janali, the sultan f s secretary, he told me that if the Bank decided to open, the Sultan would prefer to have it in 1'uscat so that he oould dispense with hie Treasury and conduct all his business through the Bank, and that it would be inconvenient for him to transact his business with the Bank if it were establish* in Muttrah. Major Stewart very kindly told xae that, if the Bank decided to open soon, he would endeavour as a temporary measure only to ro-arrange his office to give ua the use of one rooza. Acceptance of this offer would allow us the advantage of using the Agency Treasury Strong Room which is guarded all day and night by the Levies* The Strongroom, , however, has no strongroom door but only a strong grille behind which notes «i*o locked in steel boxes and coin in steel cages * After examining several buildings X decided that it would be better to leave the matter of premises to the Bank's representative to be appointed to negotiate with the Sultan in the event of it boing decided to open a Branch. Clerical &amp; Cashier Staff could not bo obtainable locally ms the standard of tjagllsh education anc^at ruscat subjects* is very low. Indian Clerks employed by the Indian firms in Muscat and Muttrah are paid Rs*lS0 to Hs*200 and are provided by their employers with free board and lodging, free electricity, dhoby charges, barber's charges and free medical treatment. Houses are available for imported staff and the rent of a good house with throe or four living rooms would be about Rs *50 to Rs*70 per month. X am told that the Bui tan would prefer to see Dual in staff employed, though he would not object to Hindu staff* X understand it Is hoped to hove an automatic telephone system installed in the near future to servo both Muscat and Ifuttrah. At present, there am only a few direct linos connecting Muscat business houses with tf flees*Thor© is an aurocii^ono situated about six silica i*ron Muscat wlilch la ueoa for oner^enci landings* I inaorf?tand f however, that the author It lea aro endoovourlno to arrange for an air-^iall service to use It* Although Muscat and tfuttrah, the two chief porta, have on ly a very sriall conbtried popxxlatlon, they do an extenalve trade* EXPORTS IJATJS* Dates fom the chief export and are shipped mostly to Bonbay* The date ^anXatm. lie in a long belt Inland and stretch xmui from round f use at along the Batlnah coast* The date season cot mono os about 15th July and finishes about the end of Lee amber If the Bombay market is good and about the end of March If the Bombay demand Is alack* a tax of 3$b, which is called an 'Import* tax. Is levied on all dates arriving in iruecat and Muttra* fron the Interior* This tax is collected at the time of ^^^port, the value of each shipment being determined by a Custcrig official who is specially trained for the purpose* Dates for local consixaptloc are allowed into tuscat tax free If they cone from the nearest garden only, otherwise they are subject to the 5^ tax* Other coastal towns also get dates tax free fron the nearest garden only • There is also an agricultural tax on the date gardena amounting to 10^ of 4 crop assessnent value when gardens are irrigated by water from Govemmont irrigation channels and at 5^ when Irrigation is done by natural wells* The Customs Department is also responsible for the collection of this tax and a Customs Official visits tlie gardens periodically to assess values• when ready, the dates are brought to Muscat and Muttrah by sea or by land route and are sold to merchants who at the oouriencQEaent of a season will have market advices from Bombay as to possible prices* as will be explained later, however, the whole business is a one thing of a gamble for the Shippers* It is oat iris ten that about 1G^&gt; to 20^ of the growers cultivate their own gardens and tliese, for the moot part, will accept only M*T* dollars in payment for their dates* At the same time, however, they purchase freta the merchants to whan they sell their dates whatever they require in the way of cloth, sugar, rice, toa, coffee and other necessities of life to support them till the next crop is ^eady and they draw cash only for the balance in ' *T* dolors* These balances represent their profit and the cash Is taken into the Interior where it is presumably burled as savings* as the date season progresses, the local demand for M*T* dollars inoroases at advancing rates but if for any reason the dor^and for d;&amp;cs In Bombay falls off, those merchants who have large holdings of M •?. dollars are often anxious to sell at prices less than tdiey paid for then* This also happens when the price of silver falls in Bocibay as merchants always regard India as the country where they can rost easily realise their holdings, even though they know that India has prohibited the import of silver* At the end of the date season, the value of the *4dollar as expressed in rupees invariably falls and those merchants who can afford to lock up funds in ia*T* dollars buy them thereby enabling them to puroiiaac their next season’s dates at Cheaper rupee rates than their less fortune competitors who aro unable to lock up funds in ftU?.dollars * da7 Advances are also nade by woaltl^ norchante to da to growers against their next season's croy, thus ensuring that they obtain the first of the croy* Vfhether shiyyed by steamer or country craft, all dates are shiyyed on a conaigmient basis and are consigned to the shippers' agents who soil the goods at thoir own discretion and chargo a selling counisaion of Prou what I could gather, it appears that tho no? bay date agents have entered into a conbine which dictates prices fron tine to tine* Although it la difficult to prove this, the fact remains that up to the time dates cor nenoc arri ving in Bombay tiic demand is reported to t o good with corroapondingly good prices but once arrivals cor «nce tim price drops and the Vuscat ex^ort&amp;r hots tho current figure for his dates after arrival• It is customary for the Muscat nerohant exporters, on shlyroent of their dates, to draw bundles on their Bombay agents for 50^ of the value of their consigns ionts and the necessity for recovering their capitrJ outlay in honouring these bundles is of ton given by the •■gents as the reason for selling the dates when yrioes aro low* Wealthier merchants who do not need to draw on thoir agents in advance but can afford to instruct their agents to hold until demand revives, have a better chance of realising better prices. Muscat merchants spoke of overhead charges Inclusive of freight, custora export tax and Indian import duty and incidental expenses as being Hs*400 to Bs*425 per baliar of datea, approx* 1BOO Iba* f rliis appeared to me to be abnormally high but however hard I tried, I could not find out how those charges were made up and I waa told that Bombay agents do not submit statements of account giving full out-turn details. Neither growera nor shippers take the tsxjubl© to grade their dates - I understand they would get better prices if they did - but ship mixtures in bags* This method can lead to assessment of import duty in Drclla operating against thorn. Import duty in India 1* aUvalorem or of tariff value which is fixed at &amp;b*40/- per CfcY, for the highest quality. He*20/- for medium quality and Ks*14/- for the lowest quality, and consignments found on exanhnation to contain a larger proportion of beat quality dates are charged the highest rate on the whole* It might be noted here that the run eat date season is about two and a half months ahead of tho Basra date season but this decided advantage which the Muscat merchants have in this field docs not appear to be ccmerclalised to its full extent* There is no insurance company r^^^sented in Muscat though Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co* Ltd., will, if requested, arrange for cover to be effected In Bombay* Merchants told me they would prefer to ship their exports by Jb*X**&gt; teasers covered against the usual marine insurance. This is easily understood as freight rates., for dates to Bombay by country craft are fron Ra*^/- to R«.4/^/0 per bag and it is recognised that 20^ to 30^ of tho dates are damaged by exposure to the Sun and oea water. Certain Muscat raerchanta, I was told, are prepared to insure country craft shipments against total lose only at a preniun of 2£* As against these freight rates, the cost of shipping by 13.1. Steamer came to Bs*3/2 per bag and insurance covering ordinary marine risks would probably be not more than l/4^. Merchant* told mo, however, that last year the Goverznent of India passed leg isolation prohibiting the Import of dates into India by B*I* Steamers except under licence which would bo granted to importers on application on tho basis of 50£ of. thoir average •r.r rg.-ma» - a - • vi © Ixnports for the three previous yeare. The prohibition docs not apply to imports by country craft for which no import licences are required# I was £;ivcsi to understand that K&amp;ckinnon I'ackenzi© &amp; Co# Ltd#, henbay # have taken up the matter with the Indian authorities# I was also given to understand that Bombay amenta who applied for import licences in their own nanes to cover their Huecat exporters 1 shipments were at one tine selling the licences at Rs#7/~ por bag # The present restriction on iupoi'ts of dates by steamer would have a serious effect on the finance of exports by the Bank if it opened a Branch as I gather exporters would prefer to get 50£ advances on their shlpnents from the Bank rather than from the chief merchant leudero# Merchants to whom I talked individually were very reluctant to talk freely to me at first and it was not until I had been about four days in Muscat that they started to tell me their worries and fears. I had t*-ied hard to find out why they did not obtain firm offtu*# from Bombay before shipping their dates but the usual reply was that the consignment method had always been followed in ?:uaoat* I was therefore rather surprised and pleased when a deputation of merchants cane and explained they were actually afraid of disclosing their business ethoda as, if they did so and the Hank did not open, they would be at the mercy of a few big merchants who, they asserted, did not want a Bank as they controlled all the business in Muscat themselves# They told me that If the Muscat merchants wera to break away from the consignment basis of exporting, all dates ordered from Bombay would be bought from two or three merchants only# I was also told during this Interview that these big merchants (no names were mentioned) were in the habit of cashing bundles drawn by smaller merchants on Bombay agents but that often they would refuse to do so, usually at times when it was most Inconvenient for the drawers of the bundle • as a result of this and several subsequent interviews, I decided it would bo beneficial to invite all merchants to meet me in a joint meeting before x left Muscat# I will narrate the happenings at this Joint meeting later in this report* FIoHC.b * The fishing industry is an important and developing one and fish and fish products constitute the second main export, the two chief items being salted fish and dry Sardines# Moat of the salted fish exports go to India# Paring the bar, th&lt; market for dry sa^dinoa was limited, with India as the chief importer, but ^^vloi^ to 1939 Muscat was developing a good trade with Oarmny and other continental countries In this commodity# Just before the outbreak of war, liajl Lihacker baji Abdul Latlff rasul employed a Caooh to install Grea a machine for making fish-meal and now flsn-neal is being exported in large quantities to Palostine and Ceylon* Prior to the ar this merchant, who is the biggest exporter of fish, exported his dry sardines on a consignment basis to Hamburg when the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the Bank of British root Africa gave him advances ag Inst his shipments which they sold under » Instructions from his Hamburg agents# Fish-meal exported to the Continent was used for poultry food and for manure#f * 9 At the beginning or the V9J?$ the Erltlch f Inlatry of Food purchased large conslgnEients of dry sardines which were shipped to Karachi and later they intimated that they would buy up all available supplies If tlie ' uacat r c ’c^uints could provide freight to the U.K, but,of course, this was impossible for theft to arrange* All Uie fish from the small coastal villages are brought by country craft to Hut trail. The seasons for sardines are from February to raid-April, fron the end of August to end of September and from the end of jttoeLiher to the end of January* Ceylon is the main market for dried fish for which the season* are June to August and novenber to January • fc'erchants are hoping to re-ooi irtenoe business with the Continent and with the United Kingdom* Dr*Berti*a*a from the Fisheries boa^d paid a visit to Muscat recently to examine the mftwtKis used for salting and drying fish* unfortunately, his report had not been received by the Agency by the time I left Muscat but I understand that he considered there was good scope for development, especially in subsidiary lines such as Shark liver-oil etc* Ljp-’ES . Limes are ^ulto an important export* They are available all the year round in Muscat and are crown behind the date garden belt and also between date gardens* They are exported chiefly to the Persian Gulf. As in the case of dates, an import tax of 3^ is charged on limes inserted into Muscat but no agricultural tax is levied* IMPQnTd * Before the Tior, Muscat imported its requirements from various countries, such as hardware and hurricane lanterns from Britain anti Geroany, textiles from Britain and Japan, cement froti Japan, sugar from Java, Coffee fron Brasil and Ceylon and cereals from India* Moat of the present-day imports come from India (with Iraq a good second) due to the fact that the bulk of the exports go to India and the proceeds are utilised in purchases from India* gone of the merchants, however, have recommenced importing from the United Kingdom but others, after w^ioactlng supplier a in the U*K, were forced to abandon negotiations on beir^ asked to furnish the name of their Bankers* At present, one-third of the imports of textiles, sugar, wheat and rice are taken over by the Government Control Department and rationed through the Government appointed agents* The remaining two-thirds of these particular imports car be sold by the merchants at whatever price they can obtain or re-exported if they desire to do so* Ho refund of duty is made on re-exports nor is there any transit duty applied* bhen conditions bocome more normal, it is reasonable to suppose that all imports of wheat and rlco will come from Karachi owing to the proximity of that port, but it is open todoubt If the old hundi adatom will oontlnue* 7ho hundl ay atom Is run on a baa la of trust oxlatln^ for nany years between fan 11 lea in Muscat and farAillea In India and with the exodus of Hindus from Pakistan It la thought unlikely that the Hundl system will continue ao regards trading with Karachi, and all export trade from i run cat to Karachi ana import trade from Karachi to Muscat would be pasaod through a Bank, If one existed in Muscat* GEingUL* The Government of India 'iroaamry attached to the Agency la to close down on ZXat March, 1948* No arran ;or-Lonts exist at present for merchants to obtain payment after that date for their exports to India and merchants are therefore anxious that a Bank should be opened In Muscat before 31st March# I do not think auitib le arrangements could \ e made in such a short time If the Bank decided to open a Branch but, if It Is decided to open, I am of the opinion that we should open before the date season c^niencoa in mid-July# if the merchants knew that the Bank wre to open before the date season they would feel much happior, as they fear that If no Bank opens, the Impossibility of getting their funds back from India my result in the export of dates being confined to the very wealthy merchants only. Major Stewart, the political Agent, has repeatedly urged the sultan to arrange for a Bank In Muscat and it was a disappointment when the imperial Baidc of Iran decided not to open# I was infer? od by merchants that the Ir^perial Bank representative made only a hurried visit to Muscat and only called on two of the wealthiest merchants who, as I have indicated else where, were not anxious to see a Bank established. Docidir^ that Muscat was a good place to get out of, he acted accordingly, because of this and because ox' Major Stewart f a rep/eated requests to the sultan for a Bank, it seems possible that the sultan might grant us a monopoly on very favourable terra. If, however, we express our willingness to open a Branch but delay doing so, ho my grant a monopoly to the highest bidder an other Banks are believed to be interested in opening in MiJacat* I surest, therefore, that, if it is decided to open, a senior representative should be sent forthwith to discuss the matter with the Sultan who is expected to return to Muscat on or about 12th J^arch for a stay of about two months only. Any delay in negotiating may result in other Banks being considered and will certainly result in losing the goodwill of the merchants, sane of whose businesses are now at a standstill because of present control regulations* v*hen I first visited Mr. Janal-, the sultan»a Secretary, it was obv&amp;ous to me that he was afraid of expressing any opinions which might be mistaken for those of the sultan, r&gt;o I did not endeavour to ascertain on what terms the Bank would be allowed to open. l/hen Major r.tewart told me, however, that he liad explained to the Sultan many times that no Bank would open in Muscat unless they thought it would be a paying proposition and that the sultan must therefore make it attractive for a Bank to open, I decided I would leave the Secretary in doubt as to what I really thought and so told hin that although I considered a Bank in Muscat was absolutely necessary for the maintenance of trade with the outside world, I did not consider it a good business proposition but tAwt the decision would rest with the .lank»s Directors. Me expressed the hap*Bank f a Directors would tako a long-tom view to which I replied that there wore nony 00081x103?©tiona to bo taken into account* It la ny opinion that, by b.is inatanaa insiatance on having a hank in Muscat, Major Stewart has pavod the way Tor easy negotiations. On the rigurea appearing in the Trade Report for 1946-47 (the Trade Report for 1947 - 48 will not be ready until June) and aasioTiln^ that morohanta make deposit# of say Re.20 lacs and the Muscat State deposits ha.20 lacs and taking into account the likelihood of merchants requiring advances against shipment* Ins oad of drawing bundles, I think the question of waning a Ei*anoh in Muscat is worthy of serious consideration. I right say that 1 endeavoured to obtain import and export trade figures for the year 1947 frcn the Director of Customs, as these were only handed to no on rty departure, I was unable to go through them oitil afterwards v/hen I found that they wore incomplete and wore valueless for purposes of this report. In view of what the Manager of Pctirolemi Concessions Ltd., i told Mr. Grant, I made no enquiries in Musoat regarding oil developmexite tut one gre't contingency cones to my mind and that is that, in the event of war in this area, all tankers leaving the narrow entrance to the IHilf would be easy targets for bombing planes and that the attention of oil companies might well be focussed on Muscat and points further east and south. I would take tho opportunity of recording vy very grateful thanks to Major and Mrs. Stewart for their very kind hospitality and to irajor Stewart for tho gonuro^xs assistance afforded me during my stay* I left Muscat on 16th inatant returned to Bahrain on the night of the 20th instant by ^^»* ’Barjora 1 -—mrn IRecord of Joint with Merohanf • Thirty-two of the bi*?, e«t norohanta cane to t}vo meeting, which waa hold In the Conaulate Clui • I aadreeaod the Hooting to the effect that the opening of a Bank in ruecat did not appear to me to be a buelneespropoaltion and thftt It certainly would be a very non-pay ing one if It did not haw tlie whole- haarted co-operation of all riex*chantA« I cont^ued that the Bank had not sent me there because the amount of bxwilnoea paaalng through Kuaacat had attracted tiiuir attention, but that X had boon sent down to examine the poeaibllltiee of opening a Branch at the repeated requaate of the i&gt;rltlah Coneulato, MU; cat, who coneidered that a Bank waa absolutely eaaentlal to enable Muscat tnorciuuita to coripote with nerchanta In other Borelan Gulf porta.

They said that oven if the present control difficulties were sun.ioiuitod, they still wanted a Bank so tiiat they would not be in the hands of a foreign selling agonts and so that their business transactions could be kept secret and trade relations with other countries developed.

( ri !uscat Bank )• The following is the position as it stands at the moment. Imperial Bank of Iran are obviously extremely anxious to establish a bank here, not so much with a view to present trade, but mere particularly in order to catch any possible oil development. 2. The Sultan, realising this, lias excluded Dhofar from any agreement, but will grant the bank to be established in Muscat^first option on any future agreement covering Dhofar. He is, however, sensible enough not to hold out for any large financial inducement cc l&lt;r to let the bank in Muscat, lest he find both banks refuse to come. r 3. A draft agreement was drawn up and approved by Eyers and the Sultan on the 4th May, but was not signed^ nor would it be until after the Sultan has seen the Eastern Bank^ representative. Ityers has promised to show you the agreement. I saw fit to tell Eyers that Eastern were sending their man down, as he would only have found out privately within a week in any case. You will no doubt appreciate that ny position here has been a little awkward. I have, in competition, two British Banks and have to give any proper assistance to the representative of one, but obviously not at the expense of the other. 5. In the absehce of an Adviser, His Highness has tended to turn to me for advice, for I find that he is not as well informed on banking matters as one might imagine. I confined my advice to :- % (a) Explaining the little I know about barjcing procedure (b) Advising in favour of a bank without pushing one more than, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE,. CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.than the other. (c) Trying to keep the price down for both competitors by pointing put the limited commercial possibilities of Muscat, In this think,I have succeeded and I hope Eastern will not be asked to provide much more favourable terms than those offered by the Imperial Pank of Ifcan ( and apparently accept able to His Highness ), I think, too, I have succeeded in sitting pretty firmly on IcJts the fence w in all private lottcrs Iribth His Highness. 6* I think actually the Sultan will probably sign the monopoly agreement with the Imperial Pank of Iran^unless Eastern offer him much more favourable terms, in fact I have no doubt he would have done so on the 4th May had I not pressed him to receive the Eastern Bank^ represent ative in accordance with para 3 of your telegram No. 396 of 3rd May, The reason for his preference for Imperial Pank is. I learn, privately, that the Imperial Pank have more branches in the Gulf that the Eastern and that he considers that these would assist Muscat trade. The advant age of Eastern Rank in having Indian Branches is in his view, diminished by the recent dwindling of Muscat * Indian trade. 7• I would guggest that, in order to get as speedy progress as possible in the negotations between His Highness and Eastern Pank, the Bank*s representative might well bring down with him $ (a) Draft agreement in skeleton for monopoly in whole state (b) Draft agreement in skeleton for monopoly in whole state (c) A man to type the various drafts and redrafts, in case he doesn’t type himself ( my own office staff assisted Payers, but found it a bit of a strain ).IN THE HA:£ OF GOD THE EKHC1FUL.

If this is so, we shall be glad if you will enquire and let us know when these arrangements are expected to be completed. In view of the fact that the Treasury Office at Muscat has ceased to function as from 1st April, 1948, Indian merchants have been experiencing great difficulty in making payments against their imports from Muscat which was hitherto arranged through the Treasury. These merchants have therefore been inquiring about the method of payment particularly in the absence of banking facilities att he moment in Muscat, and the information called for, would therefore enable us to instruct them in the matter.

By way of background I thought that you might be interest ed to have a certain amount of elaboration of the information communicated to you by telegraph. 3. Findlay has been working under two great disadvantages during his visit. 4. Firstly he has found the Muscat climate extremely trying and his health has not been good. ( I air-conditioned him by night, but this only seems to have made the day even more difficult for h5m ). 5 . Secondly, he was sent in rather a hurry and without a very clear mandate from his Firm and I consider that Eastern Bank, by not giving him any idea beforehand as to terms, put him in a difficult situation, which he seems to have handled very well. I If Eastern Bank's efforts here prove to have failed it can hardly reflect badly on Findlay. He lias left behind an unsigned draft agreement as Eyers had done, a copy of which is enclosed. 6 . The Sultan's decision to delay his final choice until after Findlay's departure, although tending to put off the time when a Bank will open, is probably fairer in the long run and in the event of Eastern Tank proving successful, would save ua from any possible suggestion by Imperial Bank that Findlay was allowed at Hie Excellency Sir Rupert nay, fcCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.

I have been informed by the Officer-in-charge, Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., that the local Cable Station is having increasing difficulty in its dealings with the public owing to the poor condition of the local bank note issue, a large proportion of which cannot be accepted. This is due not merely to the closing of the Government of India Treasury at Muscat, which used to with draw worn-out notes, but also to the quite exceptional alternations of humidity and dryness in the local climate. I estimate that at the raoment, 10 % of all notes are unfit for circulation and a further 20 % are rapidly approaching the point at which merchants will refuse to accept them* 3* Findlay spoke about the problem of withdrawal of such currency during his recent visit, and I understood from him that it by no means followed automatically that whichever bank was established here, would undertake to repatriate worn notes to India without prior arrangements being made to cover the transport and safe custody of currency thus exchanged. I gather that normally the National bank of the country which issues the currency will pay the private banks for this service. The position in the Gulf is necessarily somewhat different. 4* As by the time Imperial Bank of Iran are established in Itfusca the note circulation will have further deteriorated ( I believe the average life of a note is of the order of six months ), I should like to • His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain *to suggest that, if you see fit, they should be advised of the situation and that they should make prior arrangements accordingly for the repatriation of such notes* I do not remember Fyers having spoken of this matter during his visit* Yours sincerely,Telegram Q Froro Politicsal Resident, Bahrain To Political Agent, Muscat No, 532 i. hi Your telegram No.C 197 June 6th.

No.C 294-U/14 dated the 111 The Sultan objected originally to the bracketed phrases of the preamble to the Agreement I think, because he considered they implied separation of the functions of Sultan and of the ruler of the State, I attafch^ a record of a conversation which I had with His Highness on this subject on the 24th June. 2. Aty own view is that the omission of the portions bracketed should have no adverse effect upon the eventual operation of the Agreement• 3 The Sultan rules, as you know, completely autocratically and there are no signs of this form of government being in any way modified at present. The possibilities for an alternative government are therefore, (a) If the Sultan were to die or abdicate, he would be succeeded by a legitimate heir. ( This eventuality is catered for in any case^in the Agreement as it stands ). (b) If the Sultan were to be forcibly deposed, he would be succeeded by completely unpredictable elements in the State and for this reason, I do not consider that any Agreement drafted now could possibly take account . of such eventualities. In the event of the tribes attacking and capturing the Capital, for example, which is possible, though hardly likely, the Bank would in any case bave to reconsider its position. 4 My own view is that the Sultan and his heirs and successors represent, at present, the only stable power in Muscat and Oman with ich the Bank will be able to deal, and should his dynasty be deposed in future, any new regime is likely to be of such a nature that the Bank and other British Companies would probably have to enlist direct help of His Majesty's Government in ensuring that the de facto D. Scott, Esquire, Manager, Imperial Bank of Iran, Muscatde facto Government honoured Agreements made by the past ruler, N 5* The Sultan's objections, I believe, are purely inspired by the desire to appear as the absolute ruler of the State, which he is, at all events, in the coastal areas in which the Bank will conduct its business.

This is a temper* ary expedient as he has reserved this house for his eventual Minister of External Affairs, but by the time the latter could possibly arrive, both Ramadhan and the worst of the summer will be over and he will have had time to complete repairs to the former French Consulate which the Bank might well take over. Quite a lot needs doing, however, before any satisfactory Rjod' premises can be made out of the French Consulate. 3.

Q&gt; &lt; \h\'C\ u ^' fa On receipt of telegram from Consul-General Basra, I ^ r/ n^rself made enquiries from Mr.Dharamsi ( K.B.Gokaldas who knew the K.E. was in India ) and from Mr, Abdul Bari through Mr. Rashid Ahmed. Neither of them gave any information to raise the suspicion that the K.B^s intend ed visit was in connection with the bank. The matter was therefore referre ed to Muscat Government according to usual practice and on receipt of their reply *No Objection' was telegraphed to Basra. 2. As P.A. knows the file was at Karachi and nobody in this office knew jriarifc the antecedents of the K.B. or that he had applied for and had been refused a visa for Bahrain. In the second enclosure to S 27 which was received at Karachi the purpose of the K.B's visit was specifically mentioned as connected with the opening of branches of w The Indian &amp; Persian Gulf Bank, Ltd., w at Sharjah, Dubai and Muscat, whereas in the telegram from Basra it was merely mentioned as 'Commercial business'. . 3 . In the circumstances I would submit that there was no careless ness or negligence on my part or on the part of the Dragoman in dealing with the case nor were jEk&amp;xw nay 'instructl c ns on the subject of issue of N.O.C's contravened. I may add that I referred the application of Dr.(Miss) Hosmon whose case I knew to P.A. for orders. —t) f h- yi.•-r (3 *</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000db_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/444</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000db</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/444</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'FILE NO: 14/14 name; BANK FOR MUSCAT (IMPERIAL BANK OF IRAN &amp; THE PERSIAN GULF)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-24T22:52:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (215 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 217; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
