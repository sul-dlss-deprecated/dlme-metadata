The daughter of farmers, she relates that her parents were very strict with the daughters in the family. She recalls learning to cook and bake from her mother, but not receiving formal education. Hanady tells of tourists who visited the Qurna hillside to buy artifacts or replicas; a visitor accompanying her in the interview, Saida Hassan, states that the residents of Qurna did not prospect pharaonic artifacts as they all used to work in agriculture. Hanady says that for the former residents there has not been work available after the relocation from the hillside. She and Saida call the move the worst, saddest thing that had happened to them, saying that life on the hillside was healthier and safer.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
