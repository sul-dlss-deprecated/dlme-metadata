Foreign Office,NOTE BY FINANCIAL SECROTARY, 2nd SEPTEMBER 1915. (fi)lt(ff?) I presume that the difficulty about 'Audit Office criticism and possible submission to the House of Commons' would not be a bar to the payment to us of an advance on account of diplomatic and consular expenditure of 1915-16; and I would suggest that our consent to the inclusion of the £17,000 due to us on the Bakhtiari subsidy in the account for 1915-16 should be given conditionally on such an advance being made. It might be a round sum - £15,000 would be too little, £20,000 not too much in all the circumstances - £17,500 strictly reasonable. correspondence with the Treasury and Foreign Office of 1910-11 see for example, Mr.Campbell*8 letter to Foreign Office of 8th September 1910 -for our receiving even a standing advance, and the present incident gives us an irresistible claim to an advance at any rate on the present year’s account.

He was then favour ol scheme out has now telegraphed that Persian officers are taking an active part in German campaigi, that swedes make no attempt to control them and are inefficient and unfriendly, and that in the circur,stances ana especially as Foueette has left Pars, he is inclined to think we had better withdraw all support from swedes anu enueavour to secure their recall from Persia alto gether. In vi^w of this change of opinion on the part of His Majesty*s Consul and of exceedingly unfavourable accounts which reach me from all quarters oi hostile attitude of swedes in every part of Persia I presune that His Majesty* s Government will no longer be willing to‘ accord subvention. Swedes at Shiraz themselves declined on advice Governor General who is very pro-Geiman to accept sub- vention except with sanction of Persian Government which of course cannot mature until a cabinet is fomed.[This Document is the Property oi Hie Britonnie Majesty’s Government, and ^ ghonld be retamed to the Foreign Office when done with tmleai required lor official use.] ' j DEP^TI/IEMTAL .

Your No. 3002 dated 7th August • Present distribution of troops on the Karun line is 6 squadrons and 1 ^ ^ Horse Artillery battery* all at Ahm*. Nixon considers tiiat / jjrovided present arr^^eraenta with hakhtiaris continue to hold good these troops are sufficient sra to provide defence of Oil supply against raiders.

As Nixon iias evidently had some difficulty in understanding exact purport of your question regarding; Oil Fields we should be glad of a further explanation of your views on this point if his answer m above-given does not satisfy your requirements. In the event of a war with Lersia and the bakhtiarie repudiating their undertaking to protect Oil Fields* Nixon considers detachriient of a small force to the Oil Hells for their protection agjainst raiders would be irritating to tribes and inadvisable considering ease with which water supply and co?rt unieations could be cut off which might even entail the deep itch of a relief force to extricate it. Nixon therefore concludes that the safeguarding of Oil Fields under such conditions would be beyond the powers of force D without the withdrawal of so lar^vp a force of troops from the i Tirzria as would jeopardise the situation on that river and he desires it to be made clear that with his present force lie cannot render himself resnonsible for active operations in lersia so far inland as the Oil Fields. In this opinion we concur. ^e do not &gt; at nresent anticipate that the Bakhti ris are likely to repudiate their agreement to protect the Oil Fields but we attach great importance to the earlyconclusion of an agreement by *hich i&gt;avi shall receive a subsidy either from the Oil CoHpany or the Oovt. for the protection of lower pipe line from raiders. 1* this be done wo do not see any undue risk in Nixon’s proposed advance to fut-al-Amarah which strategically is desirable and will have a quieting influence on Fersia and the hakhtiaria.( [This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the wfrpn dim? with unless required for official use.] | ; 2922 ; 9! s RUSSIA , MILITARY , Decypher, Sir-G, Bachanan (Petrograd), August 9th.

If (?necessary) troops are not forthcoming the situation which I suggested in my telegram No. 268 as being a possibility will very soon become a serious prob ability and it appears to me that we have now to choose between two alternatives. 1st - to (?abandon) frankly effort to induce or force Persia to adopt a policy of real neutrality and rely on our own resources to keep German emissaries ouu Ol A fghanistan. This may involve withdrawal of our post offices at inland places, destruction of our telegraphs, (which have already been cut four times), and probably eventual employment of much larger force on Persia s Eastern frontier than at present required at Kasvin.

Prom casual remarks dropped by Khans (?groups omitted conversation I feel fairly certain that as part of the agreement Khans will want an ®surance that Ispahan will not be left in Russian sphere df influence, I have of course never initiated or allowed any discussion on this point. It might also be necessary to come to some similar arrangement with Kawam and Soulet. I cannot say what cost would be, but it would not, I think, exceed amount sanctioned by His Majesty’s Gov ernment, as a subvention to Pars Gendarmerie ic continued one year. As that subvention is (?abandon)ed, (see my immediately preceding telegram) might not the sum sanc tioned be diverted to above purpose, say (groups apparent ly omitted).to a total amount of tomans 200,000,. Opportunity for coming to an agreement with Khans is likely to be' very brief indeed, and I should be glad to be informed if possible by Thursday night whether I may proceed on these lines.

His Majesty’s Consul General at Ispahan has reported that he has reason to believe that there avill shortly he some 30C Germans and Austrians (latter being prisoners of war escaped from Transcaspia) assembled in that town. They are camped a short distance outside the town and possessed of large quantities of rifles and ammuni tion besides machine guns, bombs and a wireless telegraphy apparatus, and allow no one to approach their camp. They have also considerable number of Mutahid in their pay. Small parties of Germans are continually coming via Kermanshah and amongst them probably Oppenheim, Attitude of Bakhtiari at Ispahan is exceedingly dubious and I have proof that Sirdar Assad here is play ing a double game, and probably Samsan-es-Sultaneh also, Germans have more than once interrupted Indo- European Department wires south of Ispahan and German Consul there has even written to Departments officers threatening to do so. ActsActs of this kind and this considerable concentra tion at Ispahan obviously implies more than a mere attack on our Consulates, and popular rumour here asserts that German design urged by democrats is to carry off the Shah, and Government to Ispahan,. This is far-fetched, but it is not improbable that hostile Legations contem plate flight to Ispahan should Russian troops arrive at Kasvin and threaten the capital. Idearwas currently talked of three months agOc Prom this centre with communications open to Turkey via Kermanshah they would hope to throw all Persia into disorder, and paralyse the Persian Government’s action by destruction of telegraph lines, and trust to a chapter of accidents to involve her in war with us. It has also occurred to me that they might be comtemplat- ing an attack on oil fields or threatening our position at Basrah. « As before-said.Bakhtiari loyalty cannot be relied upon, while at least one party of Germans has left Isoahan for unknown destination by southern road, and they may be trying to rouse the tribes as example of (group undecypher able)-s. Sirdar Assad also has informed me in a manner that implied menaces that he was trying to make an alli ance with the Kashgais, and Kawam, and the number of small German parties going armed may indicate that attempts to fain over those powerful elements are being made. These speculations may seem far-fetched, but I can offer no better guess at the objects of German prepara tions at Ispahan, WhateverWhatever theyymay he it seems to me imperative that we should get an end put to intolerable position we are now in ot having no responsible government, and this can only be achieved by appearance of Russian troops, and I hope Russian Government will find it possible to send them at oncer Russian Minister entirely concurs r Meanwhile position of Consuls at Ispahan and Shiraz is decidedly dangerous but Russian Minister and I feel that to withdraw them and our Colonies would be a sign of weakness and might precipitate trouble. On the other hand we see no means of sending them effect ive assistance.

Sheikh of Mohammerah reminds me Bakhtiaris are not a one great body but a many-headed monster ; that their interests are now no longer limited to Bakhtiari country, but that they .have stretched their tentacles all over Persia, and though he thinks from self-interest they will not enter seriously iuto war, he is not confident of their being ready to enter into any compact with him and us. X As before stated, however, he is prepared in our joint interests to enter into matrimonial project if it proves likely to promote an agreement. 6. In view of Sirdar Jangs recent attitude it is possible he may seek to avoid open meeting with me or my representative ; in that case 1 would propose to send ilaji Rais to represent me as well as Sheikh of Mohammerah. We could hardly have a better emissary for the purpose in view. ^ After pointing out what Bakhtiaris stand to lose by joining in hostilities against us, and what they may gain by peaceful co-operation with Sheikh and us, we should state following requirements. ft. 1 hey must refuse to take up arms against us, and must do their utmost to discourage jihad generally, and vigorous suppression of it within their tribal territory. 1 hey must maintain internal order and secure escort in sphere of oil company, also on Ahwaz-Ispahan road and at Ispahan itself, where their representative must protect all subjects of Great Britain and her Allies and must maintain seeuritv of road and telegraph lines up to bars boundary. &lt;7- fhey must come to a permanent friendly understanding with Sheikh of Mohammerah and give him all necessary co-operation in Arabistan by refusing to harbour refugees from Ids territory and by maintaining peace on border. Their representative at Belibehan must likewise suppress fanaticism and maintain order there and refrain from all interference with Lirawi or with Sheikh of Mohammerah’s tribes in that vicinity. Any Bakhtiari being a provincial Governor in Southern Persia at time of outbreak of war must do his best to protect British subjects and interests, suppress fanaticism and keep [V Bakhtiari] quiet and neutral. ^.In return lor this we should undertake on conclusion of war to preserve Bakhtiari country with its present limits for tribe and give Khans local ■ a/tonomy to deal with their own tribesmen in their own way under our a?gis. We should agree to keep Bakhtiari Governor at Ispahan under our guidance and be prepared to consider Bakhtiari candidates among others for other governorships in sphere controlled by us. W e should be prepared later on to consider sympathetically any workable proposal they might put for obtaining access to ports on Persian Gulf. //.On receiving undertaking to the effect required from recognised repre- 1 s entatives of two families we would pay each branch 5,0006 each now, and 16,0006 each at end of war if they carry out their part of the bargain effectively. fput &amp; vV I'^rom Sir V.

Maclean dated 18th March. I would draw your attention more particularly to the information given by Dr. Young in his letters of the 19th and 26th February reference to the extremely dangerous intrigues of Mr. Wassmuss, the German ex-Consul at Bushire, and Mr. Eric Bohnstaff of Wonckhaus and Company’s Baghdad branch, among the Arab tribes of South &gt;Vestern Persia. It has been suggested to my Board tnat an effective means of counteracting these intrigues and of guarding against the pro-German tendency of the Swedish Gendarmerie officers, might be to induce the Bakhtiari Khans to provide a strong force of Cavalry to join the British troops in the work of quieting the disaffected tribesmen. Amir Jang, a Bakhtiari Chief (and a brother of Sirdar Jang) who came to England last year for ah operation indicated he Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.. I indicated then that he and his relatives were very desirous of gaining tne friendly support of tne british overniaent and that to gain this they would be ready in case of need to hold a considerable number of troops at the disposal of Ills 1 ajesty’s Government. lie expressed his intention of calling at toe Foreign Office to lay his proposals before toe Under Secretary of State, but whether or not this intention was ever carried out 1 have no knowledge. 1 have, ac., (Signed) G. Greenway. Chairman,Extract of letter From - Dr.M.Y.Young, Maidan-i-Naftun. To - C.Greenway, Ssq., Dated - 11th February. D/0. Confidential. I do not think that I need describe to you the situation in Ahwaz, as you will doubtless have had this by wire from Mr.Gillespie or Mr .Walpole. North of Ahwaz, however, we know that our telephone has been destroyed in several places; that our Pipe Line has suffered the same fate and has been set on fire; and that our Station at Mulathani has been looted. I should mention that all this has been done by the Sheikh’s own Arabs - the Bawi tribesmen- who have risen against him. We do not know the extent of the damage, which must be considerable, but we know that no damage has been done to telephone or pipe north of Hadam, i.e. in Kharan Lands, where I have endeavoured to establish friendly relations with the local Chiefs. Abgunji and Der-i-Xhazina are safe, and so is, of course, everything in the Bakhtiari Country, where we have continued work throughout. Our Pumping Station, however, had to be shut down yesterday, as the pressure on the lin had dropped altogether. Sirdar Jang and Sirdar Bahadur arrived on the 5th inst., and they are still here. I have full confidence in their loyalty to us, and I am sure that they will do all in their power to protect Company’s property and ourselves in their country. I venture to hope that they will be strong enough to resist by influence any. force of arms any invasion of their country by Arabs, and meantime at any rate, you need have no anxiety about the Fields and ourselves. In this connection I must mention that the Khans’ attitufle towards us is one to be commended; and I trust that, when the;y the day of reckoning comes, you will deal liberally with Sirdar Jang and Sirdar Bahadur. I cannot give you all the details of the measures that the Khans are now taking, but I may mention that when they leave in a few days, the S arum-u 1-Mu Ik will remain at the Fields with 100 Sowars to protect this property and our neighbouring Stations; he will have full powers, and, if necessary, Sirdar Jang himself will return here. I am afraid that we shall have to defray the costs of these arrangements but, in the present circumstances, you will understand that it is not a matter which I can discuss with the Khans, and, in any case, it can only be a trifle if we manage to save life and property with their aid. From — Dr. M.Y.Young, Maidan - i - Naphtun. To - C. Greenway, Ssq. Dated - 19th February 1915. Confidential. After a stay of 12 days, the Khans left for Ab-Bid on the 16th inst. and I am now able to give my impression on thoir visit. Sirdar Jang and birdar Bahadur aro absolutely loyal to us, and quite apart from the fact that it is to their interest to be so, they have displayed both in private and in public feelings of the warmest friendship towards us which had an excellent effect on the people here. I wish that I could say the same for all their tribesmen, but I cannot. There is no doubt about it that there is a strong feeling just now against everything British in this part of the world. It may not be as strong here as it is amongst the Arabs down country, but I am sorry to say that it exists.it exists. The hatred of the Bakhtiaris for the Russians is perhaps one cause, but the main reason is, of course, the religious element that underlies that feeling, and a very formidable weapon it is. ^issaries from the Mullahs, now with the Turkish force near Ahwaz, actually came here too with letters to the Khans which the latter showed me, and of which they took no note. The least said about these letters the better. The Khans were approached by the Sheikh and our authorities to render assistance in Arabistan and I understand that they refused to do so on the plea that they must abide by their decision to remain neutral. However, the true reason is that whilst they had sufficient ground for excuse to resist any interference by the Mullahs in tneir own country, they would not deliberately fight against them elsewhere. My own view is that tne present changeb of escape from injury to the Fields will be very much lessened if the Khans do get mixed up in the row down country and this opinion is based on what I gathered from the general attitude during their stay here. I felt it my duty to make these remarks both because I do not know with certainty what shape matters may take, and because I am very anxious that there should be no misunderstanding about the situation here. But I repeat again what I have already said, that at present you need have no anxiety about the fields. The Khans are with us, and the tribes follow the Khans. Nevertheless, we deemed it imperative to retain the Sarrum-ul-Mulk here with a body of sowars. At first the Khans arranged for 100 as the required number hers, but we ourselves subsequently reduced it^ it to 50 when the question of expense cropped up. As the Khans had no money I knew that we should have to pay for this. The pay of each sowar is Krs. 5 daily and this is the usual fee for sowars in this country when on special duty. But for the Sarrum-ul-Mulk they asked 1000 tomans per month or roughly about £180,and it was with the greatest difficulty that we managed to reduce it to 800 tomans or about £143 per month. They claimed that in accordance with their custom when governing a district his expense would be great, and I know that there is a good deal of xxxxfr truth in this, as whereever he may be encamped, a Khan is besieged by petty Chiefs as guests whom he has to feed for days. The total cost, including sowars* pay, would be about £276 per month. I regret this extra expenditure very much, but if viewed in another light it is an insurance against any emergency. If we continue our work in peace as we have done so far and go through these anxious times without any damage to property, I should regard it as a reasonable premium, if not a cheap one. Allowance must be made also for the special circumstances, particularly the holy war cry, and for the awkward situation in which we are placed. We can only hope that this state of affairs will not last long and that we shall be free of it in a month, or two at most. Shushtar is now quiet, though there was a cry for holy war there too last week. The latest is that two Germans arrived there 3 days ago from Pusht-i-Kuh and accompanied by one Nasir—ul—Mulk of Shiraz. It is said that they are on their way to Shiraz and that they have applied to Sirdar Jang for an escort. I heard also that there were 6 other Germans in Fusht-i-Kuh and that they were pretty liberal withwith money and arms. J&amp;t onoe informed Mohammerah of this by telegram via Shustar. I have also written to Sirdar Jang and we are having their movements watched. You may be sure that these fellows did not come there for any good and with the present temper of the people, I trust that Jang will clear them out soon. I have this moment heard that they have held two meetings in Shushtar already, obviously to rouse the people again. If Sirdar Jang does the right thing, he will have them expelled and I trust that Teheran will tell him to do so as he seems unwilling to move without definite instructions. On the face of it, it is a violation of the neutrality of this country for these people to be allowed to come and incite civil war. Personally,! did all I could do by informing the authorities n | and keeping a watch, and I trust that something has been done in the matter before it is too late. MONEY. I am glad to say that ICrs. 450,000 will reach us in a day or two. This will relieve the tension here greatly in one direction, and with' the balance which we hope Alexander will bring down from Isfahan we shall be provided with cash up to the 15th April.Maidan-i-Naphtun, 26th February 1915. Confidential. Dear Mr. Greenway, This is my third report via Isfahan on recent local events as it is still unsafe to send letters to the South. We are able, however, to communicate with Ahwaz and Mohammerah by wire via Shushtar, and it is by this means that I am keeping them briefly informed of the situation here. Germans at Shushtar. 1 am now in receipt of some details of German doings at Shushtar. I understand that three Germans arrived there, two of whom are known to us. One of % them was Mr. Wassmus, Fx-Consul Bushire and the other Mr. Fric Bohnstorff of Wonkhaus &amp; Co., Baghdad. The former - you will remember - visited these Fields some years ago and the latter now of Baghdad, was formerly Wonkhaus 1 Agent at Mohammerah where he must be well known. The party arrived at Shushtar on the 16th instant. They were accompanied by emissaries of the Beni-Turuf tribesmen carrying banners and Korans to raise the people for a holy war against us. There were 14 men with them supposed to be Turks, and there was also a Persian Notable who arrived at Shushtar on the same day en route for Shiraz, but I was informed that he had no connection with the German party. Nassir-u-Mulk is the latter’s name and he was reported to be returning to his home. All arrived from Baghdad via Pusht-i-Kun where the Vali furnished an escort. From Dizful to Shushtar they had Bakhtiari sowars. They stayed at Government House at Shushtar. The Germans interviewed the Mullahs with the object of instigating a holy war against Briuish residents nere. II understand that some money has been distributed and also rifles and ammunition, but I have been unable to verify the amount and quantities. They walked about the Bazaars and frequently in Persian dress. They delayed their journey to Shiraz by a day or two in order to interview Sheikh Murtaza (an eminent Mullah in the town and in sympathy with them on account of his enmity with the Sheikh of Mohammerah) who was on a visit to Sirdar Jang at the time. They saw this Sheikh on his return and I understand that he has been persuaded by them to take up the Jehad. They also inter viewed Sheikh Farhan, Chief of the Arab tribes inhabiting the district S.W. of Dizful and the neighbourhood of Howizah, but with what result I have been unable to ascertain. In this connection, I would mention that both Sheikh Murtaza and Sheikh Farhan were here to see the Khans a fortnight ago and they left together with the Khans. I conversed with both, especially Sheikh Murtaza whom I know well, and who has always been very friendly to us. Sheikh Murtaza is very much against the Sheikh of Mohammerah who had him exiled from Shushtar two years ago, He told me himself that if the Sheikh of Mohammerah were pushed out to-day there would be peace in Arabistan to- | morrow, and that personally he had no other object. Sheikh Farhan is a simple Arfcb, influential in his district, and I have met him once or twice before. His eldest son was ill and he left him here with me for treatment. Although old Farnah is no friend of the Sheikh of Mohammerah who had him in prison until a few months ago, he declared that he would take no part in the present row. His son is here, and needless to say that I am keeping him here. Mr .Was sinus£ Mr.Wassmus and his companion were on their way to Shiraz via Ram Hormuz and Behbahan, and they applied to Sirdar Jang for an escort. They sent him the gift of a rifle but Sirdar Jang would have no gifts and returned it. He supplied three sov/ars - clever and good men, as described in his letter to me - and the Germans left Shushtar on the 22nd inst. for Ram Hormuz via Regewa. In a private note written by himself, Sirdar Jang told me that he would clear them out of Shushtar quickly and that he would not permit them to go near any of our stations. His first wish failed but in the second he succeeded. Mr. Bohnstorff was supplied with an escort by Sheikh Farhan and he is reported to have gone to Howizah to join the Turkish force there. I understand also that Mr.Wassmus telegraphed Teheran and Sheikh of Mohammerah requesting the ”immediate” release of Holmich, formerly German Agent at Ahwaz, now reported to be under arrest. The foregoing gives you a full account of the German ”raid” on Shushtar . The town is near us and if a rising were to take place there, and spread outside, we should be the first to suffer as many Shushteris work and trade here, and all are very fanatical. But I think that I may venture an opinion from what I know of Shushtar. The place is divided. Half the town may be disposed of at once as it is for the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The other half is against him, but it can do nothing without the consent of the Sakhtiari Khans, and the latter's views are pretty well known to all by now. For this reason unless something unforeseen occurs I attach little importance to any rising of the above nature in Shushtar. It is bound to be disorganized and it is bound to fail even if it does take place. Robberies.C Robberies* Ordinary robberies occur, of course, and we have had several lately. Three mules have been removed from Dere-Khazinah and these are now being traced. At Ab-Gunji, on the night of the 19th, some 20 Arabs attacked the station and 11 mules were stolen. These are also being searched. We have sent down 15 sowars to Ab-Gun^i from here, and 12 others to Ab-Gah/Dere-Khazinah section of our road. On the 22nd instant our caravan of specie arrived here safely from Isfahan. This enabled us to pay our labour and other pressing liabilities. Mr. Thompson has reduced our labour meantime and thereby a good deal of expense. In other respects, our work is proceeding normally but of course the shortage of material is making itself felt daily and this handicaps everybody. I had no letter from the South since I wrote last week, nor had I any telegram on the situation there. Rumour has it that the Sheik 1 s forces are now at Weis, but this is all I know. Communications both by road and telegraph are open to Isfahan. I am very glad that the Sarrum-ul- Mulk is here. He investigates and punishes at once the authors of offences committed against us, and if small offences are dealt with immediately and on the spot, the lar^e o nes may never occur. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) M.G.Young.Copy Teheran, 18th March 1915. My dear Greenway, The situation here has not yet cleared. What one might call the forward party are making every use of the iSlamic sentiment and antipathy to Russia with the object of reducing the Russian hold on northern Persia. I do not suppose that they contemplate actual rupture. But the result of playing with fire is of course that the irresponsibles come more and more to the front and may, in given circumstances carry the country off its feet. In any case a strong crop of local difficulties and disturbances is springing up, which the Government is little competent to control. The Mushired Dowlahs cabinet is largely composed of Meglis favourite, little known yet as Administrators. The legislation in regard to the Treasury General does not materially alter matters in fact, for since the days of Mr.Schuster the Treasurer has had no real control. No harm will result from the changes if the Treasury is allowed to carry on the work it has really been doing - attempting to reform under foreign officials the methods of collection of revenues, and to present proper statements of the ways in which revenue and expenditure have been dealt with by the Government. I think the Treasurer General has done good work in that direction, although I am not prepared to proclaim offhand, the economy or impeccancy of the Administration. But the essential thing - a machinery to control and tie up the revenues needed for the expenditure essential to proper government -is still wanting, and the strength to maintain such a machinery in working order can be derived onlyonly from outside. Naturally I can do nothing at the present time regard to Mining or Railway matters. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H.W.MACLEAN.Maid an-i-N aphtan 5 5th March 1915, P/'O Confidential. Dear Mr. Greenway, To-day is exactly a month since our communications with the South have been interrupted. By a secret messenger we had one more letter from Mr. Gillespie, but several tele- gra ms have passed between us via Shustar. Evidently, the Persian telegraph line - newly put up by Messrs Hamilton and Hedges of the Indo-European - has not been broken by the rebels down country. The Persian line is on iron poles and in appearance it is similar to our telephone line. For a long way between Ahwaz &amp; Band-i-Qil, the Persian line nns parallel with our telephone and in many places (notably near Mullah Sani where our Station was looted) they are no more than a few yards apart. I heard that tv/o poles of the telegraph line were pulled up and that the offenders were caught and punished by the Chief of the rebels near Weis. Yet our telephone was torn down everywhere, which proves conclusively that the whole movement was directed against us, and against us alone. I have not much news from the South. The Sheikh of Mohammerah's forces came up as far as Weis where there was a skirmish between them and the Bawi tribesmen, causing the latter to flee in the direction of Ram-Hormuz in Bakhtiari territory. The Khans have ordered them to leave at once, in this connection, I should mention that when Sirdar Jang was here and there was fear of the Bawi causing more damage to bur line in Kharran district or Bakhtiari country, I asked him to send a Maamur to their Cheif-Sheikh Anayai - warning him that if he or any of his men set foot anywhere north of HaddamHaddam he will have to reckon with the Bakht. Khans. That letter was strongly worded and the Khans did not leave the fields until the reply came. This was to the effect that uhey were not moving out of their own country, that their sole object was to drive the British out of Nasseri, that it was the order of their Mullahs who have proclaimed a Jehad etc. but it was all written in a subdued tone, and Sirdar Jang was satisfied that Anayah would do no damage outside his own district. You will agree with me that next to sending a force of Bakhtiari sowars against the people, which the Khans would not do, this letter was the best that could be done. It declared the Khans views openly and it had a decided effect. The damage in Arabistan had been done. The question was to prevent further damage elsewhere and this point was settled by the Khans* letter. To quell the revolution in Arabistan was a different matter altogether and one which the Khans would not undertake, without orders from Teheran and without mo ney for the nob. Tven then I doubt if they would have gone against the Mullahs, as already explained in a previous letter. Now Sheikh Anayah fled into Bakhtiari territory near Ram-Hormuz. He was ordered to leave, or (so I heard) to come to Abbid where the Khans are encamped. I understand that Sirdar Jang intends to intervene and bring about peace by obtaining a guarantee from the Sheikh of Mohammerah that Anayah’s life will be spared, if he and his followers return to the Sheikh. If Sirdar Jang succeeds, and provided the Bawl are to be relied upon, we should benefit by it as we might then be able to begin the repair of our line. But the latest is that the Sheikh's forces were suddenly withdrawn from Weis owing to trouble (so it is said) with another tribe southA &gt; south of Ahwaz, and I do not know what effect this retirement may have on the Bawis. So far, the rebels have had no success, and certainly it is that the support they looked for has met with little or no response. Interest seems to be centied now round Ahwaz, where an attack on our troops by the Turkish force is expected daily, but whether it began or not I cannot say. I have not much news to give about ourselves. With small local troubles, irksome and annoying as they are, I will not worry you. We settle them as best as we can with the aid of the Sarrum-u 1-Mu 1 k. The important point is that our work proceeds, our pipes, or what we have of them on the banks of the river at Kharran and Dere-Khazinah are being transported as before, whilst generally there is little change from normal here. The only black spot against our show here is the robbery of 14 mules - a loss of about £280. But this has not been left unattended to, notwithstanding the general unrest in the country. The mules have been traced and I know that they are in the hands of Arans in the neighbourhood of Dizful. The Khans and others are helping, and you may rest assured every dndeavour will be made to get the animals back. Of the Germans I have not heard since they left Shushtar. They must be nearing Behbahan now. I do not think that they will do much harm at Ram-Hormuz which is entirely under the influence of the Khans. Mr.Alexander left Isfahan on the 27th ultimo with the balance of our required specie. I trust that he will turn up hers safely as he will be well protected. All the Europeans up country - about 40 - are well, and if their friendsfriends make enquiries, you may inform them that they need have no anxiety, as all the necessary precautions have been taken for their welfare and safety. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)M.Y.Young. Maidan- i-Naphtun, 15th Feb. 1915. My dear Gillespie, Thank you very much for your welcome letter of the 9th instant. We tried to send a letter down to you but no man would undertake the journey. Enclosed are letters from MacIntyre and Thompson. Briefly put, the Khans are absolutely loyal to us and I have full confidence in them. One of their younger men the Sarrum-u 1-Hulk remains here for as long as will be necessary with a force of sowars. The latter we will dis tribute as we deem fit. I have also looked after Kharran, Dere-Khazinah, and Ab-Gunji, by buying up local people and giving them support from the Khans, nevertheless I cannot be as certain about these places as I am about the Fields down to Ab-Gunji and Abgah. We can only hope that all may be well there. There is an important point that I must mention and I wish to impress it both on you and on Ranking; so long as the Khans do not become mixed up in the row down country, I have every hope that we shall get through safely without assistance, and that they will stand by us to the last and fulfil their obligations as promised. If they do get mixed up, or they are drawn into the row either by supplying sowars toSheikh or in some other way, then our property and lives may be endangered here, as the only means of revenge. So strongly do I feel this that I would ask you and Ranking to consider the matter most carefully. As matters stand at present, everything seems to point to this: tnat no one will interfere in Bakhtiari territory just now, and the Khans have some assurances to this effect. At this I leave the subject. I was very glad to hear of the V/.T.arrangement and may it come off soon. The Khans are leaving here tomorrow for Ab-Bid. I was also glad to hear of our 'material' having left Isfahan on the 8th. /hen the telephone broke down and as no one would take down a letter, I tried a wire to Mohammerah via Snushtar, but I had no reply. This was about the money. We then decided to send up Alexander to Isfahan and he left on the 11th instant. Thomson went into all our requirements up to the 15th April and he found the total to be 800,000 Krs I wrote Wright, the Manager, for this. I understand that 500,000 is on the way. I would now ask you to telegraph Wright at once to supply Alexander with the remaining .300,000 in accordance with my letter to him of the 11th instant. Our deep anxiety has been relieved by the news of the caravan now on the way, as our troubles in this connection had commenced already. May I offer a word of advice? In case it struck no one, would it not be a good plan to bring down the Nizam with his Gendarmerie to protect our line? He could be down in a fortnight if you pressed Teheran and he would do more good here than where he is. The line has been fired in at least 6 different placesplaces between ” r eis and Haddara, so we hear. It is after 2 am and I am tired, as my hands have been pretty full since the Khans arrived, so I must close. Good luck to you all, Yours sincerely, (Sd.) M.Y.Young. I doubt if this letter ever reached Gillespie as the messenger has not been heard of. M.Y.Y. V T3H3RAN, 25th March 1915. My dear Greenway, Thanks for your letter of the 19th ulto. I was amused to observe that the original Joint telegram - itself a gem - reached you greatly improved by faulty transmission and ingenious decoding. My letters will have conveyed to you my personal views, which the subsequent trend of events has confirmed. The satisfactory course of the war, particularly in the Turkish field, has minimised the anticipated trouble in this region, but the position is bad enough . Here in Teheran trouble neither is, nor has been, anticipated. Any anxiety felt here was with regard to affairs and employes in the provinces. I am glad to have weekly letters from Dr.Young at the oilfields. The Bakhtiari Chiefs have their own difficulties in preventing the Jehad mania from sprouting in their own territories. I quite agree with Dr. Young in thinking that they are doing their best to fulfil their obligations to us. It is clear that our great common interest with our allies* - -V \ allies mesb make it essential and easy to adjust general views on Persian affairs at head quarters. But the Persian patient is undoubtedly feverish, and the concurrent application of Sedatives and blisters did not seem to be doing much good. No doubt the new doctors will agree as to treatment Meantime Persia is uneasy as to whether they are physicians or Surgeons. The Valishd has arrived at Tabriz and has been well received. The Russian forces have occupied the Urmia region as far as Dilman. Rumours are spread of the terrible sufferings of the Christian population there and in Urmia under the Turkish occupation, but they lack, as yet, any good authority. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

They replied 29th March saying they were keen for a meeting, but that if they came to Ahwaz themselves or sent sowars to accompany me to another rendezvous, they feared they might become involved in grave responsibility. They therefore suggested my sending a representative or their sending one to me. 1 replied that if they could not escort me, they could not escort my representative, and so they had better send a trustworthy man to me. They evidently do not want to identify themselves openly with us just now any more than with Sheikh of Moharnmerah, but they had no compunction in identifying themselves with Wasmuss and giving him an escort to Behbehan. 691 B.

I arn directed by Secretary sir Edward Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, P.1075, erapuasizing the great importance of p, eventing the Bakntiari Khans from passing under Russian control, in the event of the dissolution of the Persian Empire. In reply, I am to state that sir E. Grey concurs in the view of the Marquess of crewe that in this eventuality local autonomy should be guaranteed to the Khans, and he would suggest, for His Lordship's con sideration, that His Majesty's Minister and His Majesty's Consular Officers on the spot should forthwith be instructed to take into their consideration the question of the area to be included in such guarantee and to furnish—(33058/15) furnish report thereon as soon as possible I arn, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, AtFrom Viceroy, 23rd March 1915. Foreign Secret. Terms of peace with Turkey. As regards Mesopotamia, we consider it essential that we should remain in permanent occupation of the whole of Basra vilayet, namely, the tract extending from Nasirieh on Euphrates, and Amara on Pigris to Persian frontier, on east to Mohammerab, and Koweit on south, and to undefined boundary in desert on west. Our reasons are that such permanent occupation (1) settles the question of our supremacy in the Persian Gulf. (2) It ensures safeguarding Abadan and Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s works, and facilitating their development. (3) It makes secure position of Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit. (4) It will pay. (5) It solves question of. Bagdad Railway terminus, while to abandon Basra would lie to betray Arabs and tribes Iriendly to us and shake the confidence of Sheikhs of Persian Gulf. We consider it imperative to occupy the whole of the Basra vilayet, as our administration will thus simply and effectively replace the former Turkish scheme of administration, which was good in principle though defective in execution. Further, we consider that on political, economic, and religious grounds the Bagdad vilayet should also lie ceded by I urkey, and a native administration under our protection and control be established there. What form that administration should take could hardly be decided at present, owing to there being no really predominant ruling factor in the whole of Eastern Mesopotamia. If and when we get to Bagdad solution of this question is likely to prove easier than it looks at present. A tempo rary solution might be the creation of a council ol Shiah and Sunni vlcmu, under direction-of a Resident. Our Bagdad Protectorate should extend to the north of Samara, which is a religious centre, and should comprise Khanikin, on trade route to Persia. We are averse from increasing our military responsibilities more than is absolutely necessary, but situation has to be faced, and it must be realised that with an unfriendly government at Bagdad, our political, military, and commercial position at Basra might become very difficult. Further, we consider that the whole property of Bagdad Kailua} Company, its rights and privileges, should be transferred to British hands, at any rate on such section of the railway as will pass through territory annexed or controlled by us after the war. As regards Persia, if she maintains nominal neutrality, we considei that our interests will be best served if Russia can be induced, in return for important concessions elsewhere, to relax her hold on Northern Peisia and to give Persia a chance to revive. Russian retirement horn Northern Persia at our instance would inspire confidence in Moslem world, and would save us from serious additional military and civil t obligations involved in partition. If, however, Persia definitely goes' into the war against us, eventual partition would appear onl} course open, and such partition might follow a line from about i a/dan (Sharakhs) on east, passing just south of Yazd to ^ azdikhast, thence through Madraseh to Khoramabad and thence along the boundary of the Russian zone to near Kasrishirin. In the event of partition being inevitable, this shoulc be our claim, but it will require more careful consideration in detail than we have been able to give it within the last few days. As regards Arabia, we should leave matters to settle themselves with a benevolent attitude on our part, but with as little outside inteifeience as possible, subject to the condition that territories of any Chiefs whose independence we may have definitely guaranteed by treaty, e.gf., Mavia, Idrisi and Bin Sand, shall be ceded by Turkey and remain under our protection.In any further communication WIG HUUJCUl/, KA.MK.U no. 31934/15.

Ranking, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Ahwaz, To—His Excellency Sir Walter Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to address Your Excellency on the subject of certain questions, which were confidentially referred to me by the Sirdar-i-Bahadur and Sirdar-i-Jang, when I saw them while on tour this autumn. I will deal ■with the points raised by the Sirdar-i-Bahadur first. V hat he told me was exceedingly interesting, both as an exposition of the state of Bakhtiari internal politics and also as being authoritative proof of lacts and deductions, which I reported to Your Excellency iu my despatch Ko. 10—67, dated Camp Ispahan, 14th July 1914. The Sirdar-i-Bahadur came to me on the 30th September 1914, after having arranged that the meeting should be a secret one, and that whatever he told me should only be divulged to Your Excellency. The Sirdar first of all reviewed Bakhtiari internal politics in detail cover ing the period from the time 1 relinquished to the time I resumed charge of this post. As this has no'doubt been reported in detail by my predecessor in various despatches, I will not trouble Your Excellency. After this review of internal politics, the Sirdar went on to say that all the Khans of the Ilkhani Branch of the Bakhtiaris had seen what they imagined to be a pre-disposition, both on the part of His Majesty’s Minister and of my predecessor, in favour of the Haji Ilkhani Branch in general, and Sirdar-i-Jang in particular, and that they feared that they and their services to His Majesty’s Government would soon be forgotten, and they themselves left out in the cold; they feared in fact that the Haji likhani Branch, with Sirdar-i-Jang at their head, would engross the friendship of His Majesty’s Government to the entire exclusion of the Ilkhani Branch. This I assured the Sirdar was not the case, and told him that if he stopped to consider a moment he would see how groundless were the fears of his family (and, quoted instances to him in proof of my contention), besides reminding him of Your Excellency’s message of encouragement, which I had already delivered to him. I went on to say that, so long as the various members of the Ilkhani Branch behaved themselves and remained loyal to their engagements they could be certain of my, and I was sure also of Your Excellency’s 0 friend ship and support, and that such loyalty to British interests would not pass unforgotten; but, at the same time, that black sheep,—I had Yusuf Khan Amir-i-Mujahid, in my mind—,could not complain if they got the just reward of their actions. His Excellency said that he was relieved at what I told him and that, as far as he personally was concerned, Your Excellency might rest assured of his unswerving loyalty to British interests; and, I think, he meant what he said. No. 22—484, dated the 14th December 1914,2 To prove to me his bond fides and the extent of the feeling of being left out in the cold existent among the members of his branch of the family, and the strength of their determination to right themselves, the Sirdar told me of a compact entered into by some members of the family, which he expected would be news to me. The facts were those reported to Tour Excellency in my despatch No. 10—67 of 14th July 1914. To briefly recapitulate what His Excellency told me—the Ilkhani Branch seeing that the Haji Ilkhani Branch in general, and especially of them the Sirdar-i-Jang, w r as a &lt; 7 m/a with His Majesty’s Minister, they deter mined to prove that the Bakhtiari affairs could not be carried out by Sirdnr-i- Jang alone, without at least their tacit acquiescence. Murtaza Kuli Khan and Yusuf Kl»an therefore agreed to upset the Sirdar-i-Jang’s affairs, with the help of the Sirdar Alfa, while, to further cripple him and make it financially impossible for him to meet this intrigue with any hope of success, it w r as arranged that the Samsam-us-Sultaneh w r as to cut off takings in Ispahan, so as to make the Sirdar-i-Jang’s share as small as possible, which share be would withhold as long as possible from him. Then when Bakhtiari affairs w r ent thoroughly wrong, and Sirdar-i-Jang bad been thoroughly dis credited in the eyes of His Majesty’s Government, the Ilkhani Branch would step in and put matters right and earn the gratitude of His Majesty’s Gov ernment at the expense of the rival branch in general, and the hated Siidar- i-Jang in particular. His Excellency went on to say that, to prove his sincerity towards British interests, he had not only accepted the post of Ilbegi, vice Amir-i-lang, but, had done his best to frustrate this nefarious plot against the Sirdar-i-Jang’s I authority. He admitted that the plot had failed, and this through Sirdar-i- Jang’s own ability and devotion to his undertakings. He concluded by saying that he would do his best to re-assure his branch of the Bakhtiaris, and that he trusted that those of them, who served the British Government loyally, would not he forgotten. Now with regard to the Sirdar-i-Jang, with whom also I similarly had a number of confidential interviews. His first request was regarding himself. He wished to dissociate him self from any of his brothers and their actions, and said that he trusted that His Majesty’s Government would consider his own actions alone in relation ship with himself, and not view him as “the brother of Amir-i-Mufakham or any other of the family”. He appealed to he afraid that, if any of his family misbehaved, he would be held responsible. I told him that, of course, lie should always use his influence and every means in his powder to keep his brothers in the straight and narrow path, hut that every ease was judged on its own merits; as each man sowed so would he reap. He was also very exercised in his mind by news, just received, of a cha nge of Governor in Ispahan. He said that he was afraid that the Samsam- us-Sultaneh would leave there, carrying away with him ail the money which he owed to him, and that he would never be able to recover it. Further, he was afraid that the new incumbent would treat him iu the same w r ay, unless Your Excellency stipulated the payment of a certain sum per annum, as a sine qua non of the Governorship. I assured him with regard to the former that he need have no fear. Any sum, which was his due and which Your Excellency had said he should get, when the original arrangement w r as made— I was careful to bring in about the original arrangement—would doubtless he paid over to him in due course. As regards the latter, I said I knew that Your Excellency was watching over his interests, and w'ould countenance no arrangement which did not adequately secure them. Tlie Sirdar-i-Jang asked me to convey to Your Excellency an expression of his deepest gratitude for your message, which 1 delivered to him, and for the interest which you took in his affairs.No 10 fi 7 T i? , t u TV £V' “l 1 lntende,1 &gt; as rp P nrt&lt;!d in my despatch Arabistln affair?

In the Sirdar’s case it must come soon to have its full effect, and his recent successful conclusion of the Kuhgelu campaign affords a suitable occasion for the grant. If lour Excellency should consider this latter suggestion favourably I would beg to suggest a telegraphic reference, so that the grant take place* Within the next few months. Such a grant will not only have the effect of quieting and pacifying the Sirdar-bJang for the future, and rewarding him for the past, but, it will have its good effect also on others of the Khans', wdio ”will see that loyalty to the British and devotion to their interests brings honour and recognition with it.

R. 1 (February 20, 9*15 p.m.) \ OUR telegram No. 253 of 10th February : Turkish action in Persia. 1 have received the following aide-memoire from Russian Government on the subject: — “Towards the end of the month of January Russian consul at Kerman shah informed the Russian Government that the situation there gave rise to apprehensions. Arrogance of the Turks was increasing from day to da}’ ; there was a rumour that they intended to send an escort of seventy men to Turkish consul at Hamadan, who had arrested a Russian subject. A Kurd, called Hadji Anta. had arrived at Kermanshah as Turkish consul, and a German consul had arrived at Kasrichirin with an escort of Turkish soldiers. “ Russian Minister, while reporting that information at the disposal of the British Legation was less disquieting, had added that Turks had persuaded Senjabis to join them, and that Vali of Pushti Kuh had promised to put 10,000 cavalry at their disposition in return for money and arms.” Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs thinks that if this news is accurate, attitude of these tribes might be attributed to influence of Salar, at present near [group undecypherable], and who is brother-in-law of the Vali of [? Pushti Kuh]. It is possible that this prince intends to possess himself of Persian Kurdistan and province of Kermanshah. Ministry for Foreign Affairs thinks there is little likelihood of a Turkish advance on Tehran via Kermanshah and Hamadan (see Tehran telegram No. 64 of 12th February). Ministry for Foreign Affairs has repeatedly recommended Persian Government to resist energetically any violation of Persian territory by Turks, and it will not fail to instruct Russian Minister at Tehran to concert with his British colleague to exert fresh pressure on Persian Government, and to recommend above-mentioned tribes to remain faithful to their Sovereign and not to side with Turks. 28fEBlS*i5 • I [214 - 1304|CO (No to t Tur Pen info whe comCONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 21, 4*55 p.m.) Tehran, February 21, 1915. (No. 73. Secret.) (February 21, 10*40 a.m.) IN answer to personal protest made by Bakhtiari Khans against Turkish menace to their country, Turkish Ambassador has replied they need be under no alarm ; that Turks will not advance against their country ; and that sole object of inroad into Persian territory is to get behind English position at Basra. A confidential agent, whom I hope to send shortly to Bagdad to collect military information, tells me that he has a Mullah brother with Turco-Arab force in Arabistan, where he says there are large numbers of clergy of Nejef and Kerbela who have been compelled to accompany Turks in order to induce Shiah population to join Jihad.

Only source of danger appears to be nervousness of my Russian colleague, who has sent to Governor-General verbal message that he will not allow German consul to enter town. “ Latter is at frontier still.” I will ask my Russian colleague if step reported to have been taken by Russian consul was under instructions.
