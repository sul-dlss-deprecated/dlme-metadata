Most of the papers are notifications of the arrival and departure of HM Ships into and out of Muscat and of the expected movements of such ships within the wider Persian Gulf region. Matters covered by the correspondence include: the nature of visits (official or not); required gun salutes, including the question of whether to fire on Fridays or not; lists of officers aboard; the protocol for visits to other ports in Oman, such as Sur and Salalah; and, if part of an official visit, the programme of social and diplomatic events that will take place. The principal ships mentioned in the file are HMS
                           Flamingo,
                           Wren, and
                           Dalrymple.Correspondence comes from: the Political Agent, Muscat; British Residency, Bahrain; Senior Naval Office in the Persian Gulf; Basil Woods Ballard, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Muscat; and the British Agency, Sharjah.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Dalrymple</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Wren</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Flamingo</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Salalah</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00004b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00004b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00004b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
