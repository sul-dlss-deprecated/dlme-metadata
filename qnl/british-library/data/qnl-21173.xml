As a measure of precaution I should like to reserve Farrukh House for the tine being in case we require it for the Residency staff* Would it 'be possible for you to arrange a lease on a monthly basis with the option of renewal. Captain H.D.H. Ranee, Political Agent, BAHRAIN. RHL.mm D .0. No.C /362» dated the 3lst July f 1946. Dear Col. Hay, Please refer to ycmr Secret D.0 # No,C/540 dated the 25th July| 19^6• 2. I have ascertained that the owner of Farrukh Rouse, Yusuf All Akbar Reza f is willing to lease the building on a monthly basis| renewable at the tenants option. 3. The landlord is stated to have paid Rs,I,821000/- for the property earlier this year and is at present demanding a rent of Rs.BOO /- p,m# f as opposed to the Rs .360/- f which the Army were paying until they vacated the building some two months ago. I think, however, that if you definitely decide to rent Farrukh House, Yusuf Ali Akbar can probably be persuaded to accept a rent of about Rs .600/- , 4» In the meanwhile I suggest that before you come to a final decision, it might be advisable for the Executive En gineer to inspect the building, as I am told that its present condition is very poor. 5. Will you kindly let me know in due course whether you wish me to pursue the matter further? vout»S nce^e^y, % ble Lieut.
