To me Secre uar^ oi State for India* Repeated: Govermnent of India* Amb a s sado r, Bagdad, political Agent, Kuwait. Subject: Kuwait-1ran Smuggling, Please refer to your telegram No. 1581 of 21st May. 1. I enclose herewith copy of letter of 23rd liay from the Embassy to me (with enclosure, letter of the same date from the Embassy to the Iraq. Government), from which it will be seen that the Iraq'Government have agreed that, from their own point of view, Lne Shaikh of Kuwait may now be approached on the lines proposed by His Majesty's Government. It is hoped to hold the conference, proposed in paragraph 6 of Foreign Office telegram i:0 ° 147 ot the 81st Ma y&gt; between the 9th and 16th June (paragraph 7 0:£ ” ajraoass y letter to the Iraq Government quoted above). r have heard in the last few days from the Political Agent, Kuwait, that the Shaikh wishes to visit England in June for raedical treat ment, and my first step must be to induce him to postpone his visit until I have had time to put the Iraqi proposal before him. 8. I observe from paragraphs 2 and 3 (b) of Foreign Office telegram just quoted that, in spite of the arguments put forward in my Express Letter No. ,354-3 y 30th April, (particularly those contained in paragraphs g (a), (c), (e), (h) and (j). His Majesty's Government are apparently still prepared in certain eventualities J ms to|. to brin 0 pressure on We Shaikh to accede to the Iraq Government’s p ro p osals. It appears to me that mediation or advice, even stron, advice, is one thing, and pressure is *uite another, and I venture once more to point out that the e ffec t oi an, such pressure on our prestige, in Kuwait particularly, and in the Persian Gulf general^ wouid he most unfort,mate. m view of the fact that there is no ’ legal obligation on the Shaikh to co-operate with the Ira, Govern ment and tnat British interests are not involved, it would be said, not only by the Shaikh of Kuwait and his people, but by the other ' Shaikhs of the Gulf (who will certainly hear of it), that for the benefit of Iran, a (comparatively) large and independent Power, His Majesty's Government had forced a certain line of action on huv/ait, a small shaikhdom which is teder our protection. Moreover, the whole position of His Majesty's Government in this matter of | , ' pressure ' on tJle Shaikh is, in my opinion, considerably weakened by the fact that His Majesty's Government - through no fault of their own - have been unable to implement their promises to the Shaikh with regard to the date gardens and Ibn Baud's blockade. I fear that mention of pressure from His Majesty's Government with regard to smuggling, will merely draw from the Shaikh the not illog- ^ leal reply that His Majesty's Government's pressure should he brought to oear first on Ira, to adjust the question of the date gardens, ana of the incursions and outrages of the Ira,i Customs officials (for which so far no reparation has been forthcoming from the Ira, Government;, and on Ibn Baud to raise the blockade. n .furtner, I do not see what pressure His Majesty’s Government can bring to bear on the Shaikh beyond a more or less direct order that he should take this or that line of action in acceding to the Iraqi proposals and, if he should refuse to obey this order, which is not improbable (since legally he is not compelled to co-operate 1 }i tne Irac i Government over the smuggling), I do not see what Measuresmeasures uis Majesty's •Government can take to enforce their con- mands. -He will then have a deplorable situation on our hands. We will get the full odium of trying to bring pressure to bear Oil the Siiainn, tne latter with the popular backing of his people will successfully have defied His Majesty's Government, and all to no result since the Irakis - His Majesty’s Government's pres sure having failed - will then proceed to institute their blockade 0n bl ‘ e tana, if his Majesty's Government will stop a Str0ng advlce ’ no such situation can arise, and I urge most earnestly that, on further consideration, they will abandon any idea of pressure. Vis-A-vis the Irag Government, His Majesty's Government -it will be observed - are not committed to pressure; the terms used in paragraph 3 of the Embassy letter to the Iraq Government referred to above are that His Majesty's Government are prepared 'to urge the Shaikh strongly'. 1 C,A. &gt; ( I f y r j v ^ - 7 i % ' { (111/45/35) e ,M,1; / SP®- ti sh ' .-nib as sy, Bagdad. 23rd May, 1935, Hy dear Colonel, I enclose herewith copy of the letter which I handed to His .excellency Yasin Pasha this morning and \vuie.ii formed the 'basis of the discussion at which you were present. .-is excellency, as you are aware, agreed that so lar as concerns the Iraqi Government, the Shaikh of Kuwait may now he approached on the lines proposed.

For some two years the Iraqi Government had endeavoured unsuccessfully to reach agreement wioh the Shaikh on this matter, :oir Francis Humphrys acted promptly on Nuri Pasha’s suggestion and for the past few months the question of omuggling from Kuwait has formed the subject of most earnest c on si ox' ration, not only by His Majesty’s Government but also oq His majesty’s embassy in discussion with the heads and advisers of the competent departments of the Iraqi Government and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I now have pleasure in informing Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their good offices and to urge the Shaikh strongly to accept a solution of the present difficulties on bases approximating to those which emerged from the discussions mentioned above. 4. These bases may be briefly and generally summarised as follows :- (1'' appoinbrnent oi a British Customs Director at Kuwait ■ with special powers (not excluding the possibility of restricting Excellency Yasin Pasha al Hashimi, Acting Minister for Foreign affairs, BAGDAD.res uricting the import of certain commodities), who would work in close liaison with the Iraqi Customs authorities and the Political Agent at Kuwait. (2) The co-operation of the shaikh of Kuwait in making effective a frontier control and customs cordon system oo be set up by the Iraqi Government. r. In order that the problem may be adequately considered in all its aspects, and details worked out with a view to arrive at a satisfactory solution to all concerned, His Majesty's Government propose that a confex’ence, presided over by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, be called at a very early date at some convenient place at which the Iraqi Government an d 'die Shaikh of Kuwait would he represented, °* 11 l,Iie Iraqi Government are in general agreement with this proposal and are prepared not to insist on any particular solution pending the result of the conference, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (who is at present in Bagdad and will leave on ray 25th; will make the necessary representations bo tie Shaikh of Kuwait in the very near future, I* The Political Resident will he available to preside over such a conference at some time between J u ne 9th and June 16th next. So I shall he glad to learn as soon as possible whether iour .excellency agrees to this proposed procedure, I avail myself of this opportunity to express to Your •iicellency the assurance of my highest considerations (For His Majesty’s Ambassador),P.Z.5329/35. : n, KUyVAIT. 20 ' grflupfi-iin^. 3 yed Hamid Beg, the Iraqi Deputy for Basrah, when calling on the Political Agent, Kuwait at the ena of npril haa much to say on this question. 21. He considered that the only just course for his government to adopt was to set up Customs posts along the Kuwait-Iraq frontier, the intervening gaps being watched by car patrols, such a preventative system, coupled with a genuine effort on the part of Iraq to cultivate more friendly relations with Kuwait would, he thought, he a satisiactor^ solution to tiie problem. 22. His views appear to have gained official sanctior for in mia-may it was reported that a car patrol had intercepted some smugglers and in tne ensuing action six customs men and three Iraqi smugglers were killed. The contraband was captured.89.

On this basis solution should be possible on lollowing iines' (a) A PP°idtment of British customs director at Koweit Phase precise pov/ers must necessarily depend on outcome of proposed.....mm% 2, proposed coDference. Sheikh’s reluctance to abdicate his control over customs sould probably be met by arrangement T under which director should refer to Sheikh for formal approval in all cases of importance, such as restriction of specific imports (should this eventually form part of settlement)c He would work in close touch with Political Agent, and His Majesty’s Government would be willing to bring pressure to bear on Sheikh if he refused to accept customs * 4 director’s reasonable recommendations, establishment of close liaison between Koweit and Iraqi customs directorates should moreover be possible without derogation from Sheikh’s sovereignty. (b) Establishment of Iraqi control on land frontier as suggested above in which Sheikh would co-operate by in stituting system of manifests for land exports. His Majesty's Government would bring pressure to bear on Sheikh to impose severe penalties, such as fine of ten times value of goods on Koweitis found smuggling after institution of system, and Iraqi Government would presumably take oorresponding action wi*th Iraqis. If Iraqi Government are in fact in a position to carry out their threat of imposing land blockade, it should be possible for them to overcome practical difficulties of system of control now suggested, which appears to offer only solution of problem, while adoption of manifests would enable patrols to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate trade. 4, Conference could also discuss possible Koweiti pre ventive serviceo This must be under exclusive Koweiti con trol, but His Majesty’s Government agree with resident that since action will be taken solely in interests of Iraq and in consequence of high Iraqi tariffs, and without any obliga tion on Koweit under international law or practice, whole cost of such service should fall on Iraq. r-5 * o aodl^ivendi on above lines, while not fully meeting views of p-w-hn^ on ^ ' J ' '' lue ’ fiSems t0 offer best prospect of a SOlUti0aaad W0Uld certal ^y be to best interests of both. ns ioya.,o.s place of conference, relatively neutral spot such as Basra would off°r 0 - Lj - er m0j - e detached, atmosphere than eitacr ^uau^ or Koweit, both of which would be objectionable, du might be possible alternative, it is desirable that conference should be presided over by Bowie, who is iull.y aware of views of both sides and can be relied upon to keen even balance.

The Resident leaves Iraq tomorrow and will probably proceed to Koweit. The Embassy have been pressing that he should if possible be given instructions as to the line to be taken with the Sheikh before then. 2. I ao not feel very optimistic about the situation. Sir A. Clark Kerr has been largely convinced by the Iraqi siae of the case, and the Iraqis, while slightly more reasonable in appearance, have not gone very far in substance to meet us. The Resident equally has remained of his earlier opinion that after warning the sheikh of the probable consequences of failing to reach an agreement with Iraq we ought not to intervene. He still seems to me entirely to overlook the political interests/interests involved (compare his remarks in para.a(g)) and to ignore the fact that if a really serious situation arises as a result of the application of Iraqi pressure to the Sheikh H.M.G. would he hound to intervene and to try to handle the situation, which will hy then he worse rather than better, 3.

He came straight from Bagdad and called on me on arrival, with Syed Abdur Rahman al Naqib, his cousin and one Yusuf al Salim a well-known resident of Basra. 3* Though Syed Hamid Beg r s visit was, he assured me, quite of an informal nature, (he had only come down, he said, to see his sister who is married to the Shaikh^ son) he early on started discussing the Shaikh*s Date gardens question, and the Iraq Government’s smuggling accusations against Kuwai t o 4. As Syed Hamid is a very influential deputy in the Iraq Parliament, and as his opinions count for something in Bagdad, I think it worth while reporting the gist of what he said, as it shows that there is a good deal of informative and influential opinion in Iraq, which sees the Shaikh of Kuwait’s point of view and is out tor just and conciliatory methods. 5. As regards the date cardans , Syed Hamid’s views were as follows:- (a) He deplored the way in which the Iraq Government had deliberately gone out to persecute the Shaiich during the last four years, and considered such methods the worst form of diplomatic tactics that his country coulu have undertaken - Kuwait, he said, was Iraq’s near and good neighbour /neighbour and was ruled by a high spirited and proud Arab of ancient lineage, and his country Iraq ought to have known better than M to drive a spear into Shaikh Ahmad's heart' (his words), and so deeply wound him as to make it almost impossible to recover lost ground or ever discuss any minor disputes which arose, in friendly manner again* (b) Iraq's whole quarrel was really with His Majesty's Government and not with Kuwait, and she ought, instead of attempting to take the law into her own hands, and force date garden revenue out of the Shaikh, to have held her hand where Kuwait was concerned and carried the warfare to London* Kuwait's good-will and friendship she should have cultivated from the first* Her obvious line was to have given an ultimatum to His Majesty's Government 4 years ago and warn her that if within say a definite period of time, she (His Majesty's Govern- ment) did not pay Kuwait's garden taxes herself and incidentally honour her pledges to Kuwait by so doing, she (Iraq) would most reluctantly have to take steps to recover same direct* This course, said Syed Hamid Beg, would at any rate not have made an 'enemy' of the Shaikh of Kuwait* (c) Clearly, continued Syed Hamid Beg, the Shaikh had been deeply wounded by Iraq's stupid and bullying action, and the smuggling question had been rendered ten times more difficult of settlement in consequence, for to use a slang expression 'the Shaikh was justifiably trying to get his own back'* xxxxxxxx x x x x x x x 6* As regards 'smuggling' Syed Hamid Beg's views were as follows s- (a) By dragging in His Majesty's Government, and by exaggerating difficulties by publicity, and by strong propaganda in the press, Iraq had again shown unutterably stupid tacticsoThey had preferred ,, HUN ,, methods to quiet and unofficial friendly discussions* For this he blamed certain Customs officials, who gave wrong advice to his Government, and who hoped to get His Majesty’s Government, by clever manipulation of facts, to take up the cudgels on behalf of Iraq and force Kuwait to toe the line, irrespective of the rights of small communities and elementary justice* (b) Clearly and obviously the whole onus of stopping the smuggling lay with Iraq, and the only way to do this was for Iraq to place two or three strong Customs cum police pos ts on the frontier and patrol between them with light armed cars: If this were done he (Hamid Beg) believed that matters would be settled within a fortnight: Add to the above ’’good-will” on the part of the Shaikh, born of better treatment where his date gardens etc* were concerned, and everything would be arranged satisfactorily. The one important and outstanding point, however, was that Iraq must go ahead in the first place and act on her own without trying in any way to drag in the Shaikh by raising any so-called question of‘co-opera tion”. This latter would follow of itself, if Iraq acted Dy strictly legal methods, and won the Shaikh’s good-will, by treating him properly in other directions • (c) All talk of placing an Englishman in charge of the Kuwait Customs etc* etc* was so much foolishness, and would only acerbate the situation: The man would have to be the servant of the Shaikh, and must in the end act under his orders, for the Shaikh was after all an independent ruler and could not abdicate his rights* The one and only solution was for Iraq to herself guard her frontiers, and in other directions go ’’all out” for improving good relations* (d) He finally hinted that with the departure of certain /certain British officials from Iraq, a new era of under standing and friendliness would arise between the two neighbouring States* X X X X X X X X X X X X X 8. Before he went, Syed Hamid Beg, pointed out that he fully realised (though certain persons in Bagdad did not) that Shaikh iffiaad, though an autocrat, lived and existed by the good-will of his subjects* That with all the good-will in the world, and even if he were stupid and weak en&amp;ugh, in his desire to placate, to agree to Iraq * s demands, such as having an outside Customs officer, or a quota for imports he could not with safety to himself do so* He would have to face the undoubted prospect of revolution, abdication or even worse* This everyone who knew anything about the case appreciated to the full. *^********GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. cqkfidektt al « Department.

(b) The Iraq Government no doubt suffer loss by reason of the trade between Kuwait and Iraq.

The Shaikh having regard to his responsibilities to his people has to decide whether they will suffer less under (1) or (2)« „ {jjf fr* ( g ) British interests are not directly involved. T.

Iraq declares a blockade, provided the Iraq measures are legal, His Majesty's Government have no further responsihilitty in the matter. The question of an Iraq blockade is entirely different from that of the Saudi blockade /-3- blockade since with regard to the latter Kis Majesty’s Government promised the Shaikh, in return for his not assisting the rebels against Ibn Saud in 1929, that they would do their best to get it removed* (i) In view of the above considerations I am strongly of opinion that Eis Majesty’s Government’s mediation should not go further than giving advice to the Shaikh as in para graph 2 (h) above* It is in ny opinion essential that we should not lay ourselves open to an accusation either by the Siaikh, or by his people, that under pressure from us as opposed to advice , for the benefit of Iraq measures were forced upon Kuwait which caused loss to the latter* (j) If the Shaikh without pressure from us either accepts co-operation with Iraq, or decides to run the risk of the Iraq blockade (see paragraph 2 (h) above), the responsibility will be that of Kuwait and not of His Majesty’s Government* 3. The present proposals of the Iraqi Government as given in paragraphs 9 and 12 of Ambassador f s despatch appear to be as follows: (a) The appointment of a British Customs Director at Kuwait. (b) The granting to this Director of ’’powers other than those usually invested in such an official' sufficient to enable him to carry out measures which (in the opinion of the Iraq Government) are essential to stop smuggling* (c) The establishment of a small Kuwaiti preventive force to work either under the Customs Director or a specially appointed British Officer, and in harmony with the Iraqi Preventive Service* (d) Should the Shaikh agree to the above the Iraq Government /—r Government on their side are prepared to assist the Shaikh to make good, within reason, the revenue he will lose if their proposals are applied® They will e.g* meet part of the salaries of the Customs Director and his staff and of the cost of other preventive measures* Payment on this account will he made rt in such a way as to leave the Shaikh a good margin of profit on the transaction® 11 4® With regard to (a).

I * Orif|iuS aiyl nature of th e ufobllil* The contraMnd trade into Iraq is due primarily to the nigh level of the Iraq.! customs tariff, whiek averages 7b% on such staple commodities as tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, matches, as compared with the low tariff prevailing in Xoweit, where tae Sheikh is bound by treaty not to levy more than 4- on goods imported by British merchants. The iolitieal Agent at oweit has pointed out that up to quite recently smuggling from a-oweit was 'mainly into iersia and Saudi Arabia, where the customs tariffs are even more fantastically hi ;h than in Iraq. Lately, however, a such stricter control has been established in -® rs ~ a * • iidea 1)y l,ue new .ersian gunboats, while the ruthless methods of Ibn Malawi, the Governor of El iiasa, has made it increasingly difficult to run the gauntlet into I'ejd. Accordingly the efforts of the i snuggling fraternity have been increasingly turned towards Iraq, whers conditions are easier owing to a long and ill-guarded iesert| frontier and the presence of continual normal contacts between the two countries, due both to long established trade relations and to seasonal tribal migrations, wnieh can oe used as a cloa.. to cover the traffic in contraband. The Iraqi customs authori ties estimated in 1955 that Iraq lost some : 50 ,GoU annually by the contraband trade from roweit, ana it seems to nave inciease. considerably since then, to judge by the rise in imports into i oweit and other independent evidence. The Iraqis claim to have captured contraband to the value o f .,15,000 _V£15,000 in 1934 (the duty on which would have been £10,000), yet there is little doubt that the laryer part slips through the patrols* 2. An Important feature of the problem is that the actual siaU g lers are said to be rarely } oweitis, although opinions differ as to the part played by a 'professional” element domiciled in 'oweit. 'he bulk of the traffic is carried on across the land frontier by tribes:sen (largely if not entirely raqi or iejdi) either „rofessional smup c .; } 1 p&gt;'- or sinply tribesmen who take advantage of a seasonal migration from !,.oweit back into Iraq, to bring in small tities of contraband. Smuggling by sea is said by Colonel Dickson to be largely ran by small Iraqi boats trading with Koweit P assisted by oweiti dhows, rat although the coast is favourable it is not longhand the Iraqis have been able to keep it within bounds by their armed launch patrols. . 3.The part played by doweit is almost enf pMim ^ nerchant community confine themselves to selling tneir goods ano. not asking questions. The capital and the organisation for the contraband trade originate in Iraq, mainly (as the Iraqi autuori- ties admit) in Basrah* It is this fact that 1-enas weight to the Sheikh's contention that it is for Iraq to prevent smuggling on her frontier and that owelt*s contribution can be limited to controlling exports by sea through a system of manifests. But nit her to tae Iraqi Government have siiruna from attempting to establish an effective preventive system, and they leave a few scattered police posts and a number of car patrols to gnard a i.esert frontier of 150 miles. They believe, probably rigntly, tliatwn i 'o t.iat it would be easier and such cheaper (even if it meant a | subsidy to the Sheikh) to stop the smuggling at its base, in | fCoweit town; ana they hope to accomplish this by ,,utt\ ressure 1 on the Sheikh and so avoid the trouble and expense of organising an eiieetive patrol service in the vast wilderness of the Southern esert ot 1 ’ a&lt; l* They doubtless hope also to avoid taking repress ive measures against their own tribes, such as would be inevitable ii tney tries: seriously to stop t .e traffic on their own territory hi., as Colouel lic.csoa has remarked, the 'riffend!' rulers of J ' ra(1 ‘ ;0 no+J se ® a *° ha ' sre considered copying the methods of Ito bauo and oulistiii the sup. ort of their own tribes by offering a | proportion of all captured contraband, toother example of the Ushire ties- SUi&gt;ineiiCSS of the lra 4i authorities is that they continue to per- 69/91 of 5ar, / riit thC eXx0rt ° f :raqi cigarettes to omit out of bom. and under 19tA drawback, although in most cases they are smug led back again. ^3688/2079/ 4 * J ' r * r5ec - ;e tt has pointed out that there is no international 1 ox 19oo. obligation a oweit to take active steps to prevent smuggling from her territory into that of her neighbours. It would be wrong ioi her to assist the contraband, trader but except for the ex allegations of Iraqi officials nobody has suggested that the Sheikh and his Government (except perhaps for a few minor official 1 tVake any snare in the matter beyond receiving customs duty on the proportion of oweit’s imports which are destined to be saiug, v led i mi. i r. ieckett expressed the opinion tnat at the most it would haruly be in oonfomiity with the attitude of a friendly state for ...oweit to refuse to consider any scheme of co-operation pet u] to her by ±r .q, provided such a scheme entailed no bur.-en on 'oweit other than the loss of profits on the illicit trade. Apart from tae legal aspect anti the fact that the smugglers are almost m nevernever Ms ovm subjects, the Shaikh has a good reason for not helping the Iraqi authorities out of their difficulties, doweit has been impoverished by the decay of the pearling industry and the loss of the entrepdt and transit trade with Kejd as a result 'owelt of tiie blockade maintained by Ibn Sand for the past twelve years tiie goods soli, to smugglers brings wealth to her Merchants auu reveilue ow@1 ^^ customs.

He fears the intentions of Iraqi nationalism to wards Ms principality? and the undoubted stranglehold which Iraq \ has 011 the economic life of Kowoit; he resents the treatment he has I received over his date gardens in Iraq and the high-handed and after illegal actions of the Iraqi patrols by land and sea, who infringe his sovereignty and murder his subjects. Throughout the three years cnat the smuggling dispute has gone on, there have been eon- | stant incidents, often of a serio &lt;s nature, and although in many cases clearly to blase the Iraqi authorities have never given any satisfaction Tills has embittered the whole controversy and provided tiie dheifch with an argument for refusing to co-operate with the Iraqis, II.II.

Hie Iraqi authorities first became seriously aleraed in 1952 at the extent of smuggling froa Koweit, end in September of that year certain proposals for checking it were communicated serai-officially through the High Camission at Bagdad to the .5086/2079/ Political Resident at Bushire. 91 of in ..arch 1935 an expanded 1935.

The Iraqi minister of Finance had communicated a 5088/2079/ memorandum on the smuggling to Sir FJiumphiys when he was in London in July 1935 in attendance on King Faisal, setting out the Iraqi point of view and calling attention to the urgent need for ending the abuse. Ihe matter was not pursued further at the time but ?/hen the Assyrian crisis abated in the autumn and renewed attention had been drawn to the problem by a particularly serious shooting affray in Koweit waters Sir F. Humphry® endeavoured to organise a conference in Bagdad under the presidency of the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss a wide' range of issues(including the limit of territorial waters) involved in the smuggling question. Unfortunately the conference broke down in February 1934 through the reluctance of the Sheikh to give full authority to his Koweiti representative, and of the Political Resident to involve himself directly in the controversy by acting as the principal representative of Koweit. ( H.B. His Majesty's Government were unable to endorse Colonel's Fowls's attitude which appeared inconsistent with tine policy of tightening control over Koweit and of preventing the Sheikh free entering into direct correspondence with foreign powers). The only result of the conference was that the Sheikh produced a scheme for tightening up the manifest system to control yx ox 1938, 1180/669/ 91 of 1934. exports...•exports by sea; Colonel Fowl© urged that they should be put before t e Iraqi Government since although the volume of 7669/ smuggling by sea was much smaller tlian by land, it was here that f • • • f M. Koweitis actually engaged in smuggling and the worst incidents occurred* But the Sheikh’s scheme did not make a good impression at Bagdad and was strongly criticised as inadequate and ignoring the snuggling by land when Colonel Fowl© attended an informal meeting at the Qabassy on his way home on leave in omjy. 9. Agreement was, however, reached at the informal discussion in July for two Iraqi representatives to visit Koweit to endeavour to restore friendly relations with the Sheikh and explain the point of view of their Government and in September 1954 this mission was entrusted to the hutessarii of Basra and the Director General of Foreign Affairs* Unfortunately the Sheikh took offence at the short notice he had been given of their arrival and refused to discuss the delegates’ proposals. ■These were considerably more severe than anything submitted hitherto and provided for:~ (1) An undertaking by the Sheikh to prevent smuggling. (2) Practical measures to implement (1): either (a) to apply the Iraqi tariff in Koweit with technical advice from the Iraqi customs department; or (b) to retain the existing tariff in Koweit but to place the customs under Iraqi officials (nominally in the employ of the Sheikh) and to limit imports into Koweit. (S) Compensation to the Sheikh under 2(a) or (b). If these proposals were unacceptable the Iraqi Government would discuss any suggestions put forward by the Sheikh.xdad des- ich Mo. 11 7652/689 1954. shire eies*- ten Mo .27 S 77/127/91, 10. Tile Sheikh viewed the Iraqi pi^oposals with suspicion and he told Colonel Fowie in Uovember tliat he was unable to accept the Iraqi proposals under 2(a) or (b) as they would infringe his sovereign rights. He repeated, however, his suggestion for improving the system of manifests for exports by sea. But the reception accorded to their proposals exasperated the Iraqis and in a despatch of December 16, Sir F* Humphrys reported that they were now seriously considering drastic unilateral measures including t he t otal prohibition of imports from Koweit, severe restrictions on the entry of Koweiti craft into Iraqi waters (where they proceed to fetch fresh water) the withdrawal of the customs concessions hitherto extended to Foweit, and the strengthening of the armed patrols on the Iraqi land frontier. He quoted figures which in his opinion made it difficult to refute the Iraqi contention that the contraband trade from Koweit lost Iraq £50,000 a year in revenue and was increasing annually, and alluded to the Iraqi belief that the Sheikh was personally interested in the smuggling. The Ambassador^ stated that the Sheikhs proposals for controlling exports by sea were useless as they left untouched the main problem of land smuggling: he aided that as the Sheikh had twice rejected the Iraqi proposals it did not seem to be for Iraq to take the next step. He concluded by advising the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government as an alternative to an Iraqi blockade of Koweit. 11. Commenting on Sir F. Humphrydespatch the Political Resident pointed out the danger of His Majesty’s Government incurring the odium of forcing on the Sheikh measures which would cause loss to his people. He would prefer to leave the Sheikh to sake his own terms with Ix*aq or to put up with a blockade.•»••2011/127/ 91. blockade of his territories, in other words 'to let natters cone to a head”. Colonel Fowle concluded by proposing to address a letter to the Sheikh recapitulating the position, warning him that there was danger of the Iraqis taking vigorous counter measures to which it would not be possible for His Majesty’s Government to object, and asking him whether in these circumstances he wished to make any advance on his previous proposals. Colonel Fovle, supported by the Government of India saw objection to a proposal by Sir F. Itaphrys that he should visit Bagdad and negotiate on the matter without the Sheikh's authorisation. 12. The negotiations had clearly come to a deadlock and the problem was reviewed at an interdepartmental meeting on February 5, 1955, It was pointed, out by Mr. Rendel at tue meeting that the first thing was to provide the necessary administrative machinery at Koweit to operate any scheme for customs control which sight be devised and that it seemed essential for this purpose to secure the appointment of a British Director of the Koweit customs. The Sheikh might be informed that such an appointment was a necessary condition of His Majesty's Government helping him to solve the smuggling problem, and that he should be warned that he would be left to face Iraqi hostility alone if he refused. The India office representative drew attention to the very serious situation which would arise if the Sheikh proved obstinate and Iraq actually instituted her threatened reprisals; sooner or later His Majesty's Government would be obliged, to intervene to re establish good relations between the two countries. The India Office favoured the idea of a British customs Director, and^ suggested as a possible solution an extension of the Sheikh's ^manifest' .. ♦ • *10 . n 0,Tel.No. f to Bagdad. ,909. 1120A2V 91. rroposals to cover land teling? coupled wiUi r proper preventive service on the Irtq itde of the frontier* 15. Is a result of this meeting His 'alesty’s / at Bagdad was .instructed that His Majesty's Govenment were opposed to any idea of a customs union between Iraq or to Iraq gaining control of the Kowelt customs* considered that the responsibil: . . c.u..- ! »igglin^i by land devolved on Iraq and that she cmgkt to take effective preventive aeasures# • t the same that His Majesty's Govern ment thought it most desirable that a Britisli Director sixould he a/ig'ointed. to the -'oweit customs, and the liope was that if the shaikh's proposal for manifests for shipments useful a similar system migixt be devised for the control of ' trade by lend. This telegram was created to the Political Resident who was consulted at the sme time about the suggested appointment of a customs director. 14. Unfortunately tiiese instructions never received a proper hearing at Bagdad since they crossed a despatch from the /mbassmlor (.40*73 of February 7) containing suggestions spcsrisared by the Mbassy, the i dviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance and the Iraqi Inspectoi&gt;0mersl of Customs, which virtually araouated 'to a more detailed version of the alterna* tivo 2(h) scheme described in para*jra.|h 9 above which had been rejected by His lajesty's Goverment as well as the Sheikh* The MviseiV suggestions conceded that control of the oweit customs sho ic be given to a British Director but insisted tlxat in return for one half of Ms salary mi staff being phi by Iraq he should work in. the closest co-operation witli the Iraqi customs* It went on to suggest (a) the limitation of imports into Koweit of certain comodi ties (supr.# tear coffee,* natenes# tobacco, cigarettes, cigarette paper) on a per capita basis, fixed *»*11 . eos/ 127 / 91. &gt;56/127/ 91. dre des- ih Ic.175-3 ^GA27/ 91, ,Tel.Ho,77. mA27/ 91. fixed on figures for Iraq.; (b) the formtion of a joint Koweit- Iraqi preventive service. In return for these measures Hie Iraqi Oovemnent would pay the Sheikh a lira mm annually. It was explained, that as the Sheikh had not furnished a reply to the Iraqi proposals of September 1934 it was not for the Iraqi Government to take the next move. But if these proposals were accepted by the Sheikh in principle His Majesty’s Embassy could put them forward, to the Iraqi Government. The despatch urged the need for a time limit and hinted that the Iraqi Government could not be restrained much longer from taking reprisals against Koweit. It was followed by a telegram from Bagdad (Io.4-7) stating that the proposals put forward by His Majesty’s Government (paragraph 7 above) were unacceptable to Hie Iraqi Government, and threatening that unless the Sheikh adopted at once a scheme on the lines of that sponsored by the Embassy the Iraqi Government would be obliged to take coercive measures amounting to a*-strict blockade since the distances and ' nature of the country prevented an efficient patrol system. The Iraqis were also said to be contemplating refusing access tc Koweit vessels fetching fresh water from the Shatt-el-Arab. Meanwhile Sir Francis Humphrys had visited Bushire and succeeded in inducing Colonel Fowle to revise Ms proposed letter to Hie Sheikh (pa.ragra.ph 11 above) so as to include the latest scheme from Bagdad in the form of a w suggestion* by Sir F .Humphrys (but known to be acceptable to the Iraqi Government) * 15* These developments led to further reconsideration of the problem in conjunction with the India Office, and it was decided that His Majesty’s Government must now come forward actively as mediators. On March 1,1955, Sir F. Humphrys was in formed that the measures he had suggested involved too much Iraq! interference # ♦♦1495/127/91, .O.Tel, 0.664. 1522/127/91. 12 , interference in r.oweit and were politically objectionable. At the sane time His Majesty f s Oovemaent would be prepared to press the Sheikh to appoint a British Customs Director with sufficient powers to work out a scheme of practical co-operation provided they could be assured that the Iraqi Government would agree to a solution on these lines and would develop an adequate preventive organisation of their own. But His Majesty’s Government would not tolerate coercion of the Sheikh by Iraq if he accepted a solution put forward by them. On the same day Colonel Fowle was told that His Majesty’s Government could not any longer stand aloof from the dispute. As soon as he receive confirmation from Bagdad that the Iraqi Government were prepared to accept in principle the solution on the new lines proposed by His Majesty’s Government to Hie 1’mbassy at Bagdad he was to visit Koweit, warn the Sheikh that the situation had become very serious for him and urge him to put forward a concrete scheme of his own embodying the appointment of a British Director of Customs* (half of whose salary should be paid by Iraq) who would be able to operate an effective system of control to be worked out in detail later. If he agreed to this the Sheikh was to be told that His Majesty’s Government would support him strongly against Iraq; if he refused he was to be warned that His Majesty’s Government considered it a serious matter and could take no responsibility for the result. 16* The Political Resident duly proceeded to Koweit early in larch in order to approach the Sheikh when the anticipated assurances had been received from the Iraqi Government. These however did not materialise and in their place cane a long telegram from Bagdad reiterating Hie old arguments against Koweit and stating that the proposals advanced by His Majesty’s Government ..,..Bagdad Tel. ! b.82. * 1676/127/ 91# &gt;2 ^7 IS. (xov'emaeat were still quite inaceeptable to the Iraq (xoverninent. The appointment of a customs director was described as useless without one or oilier of the Iraqi schemes (i.e. equalisation of the Koweit tariff to that of Iraq or limitation, by quota of certain imports)# 17. The reply to the Ambassador was a re-statement of the mediation which His Majesty’s Government had approved, and Sir Francis Humphry® was requested to confirm that the Iraqi Government would he willing to discuss a settlement on the basis of the appointment of a British Director of Customs at Koweit without prejudice to further details of a scheme to be worked out by the interested parties and His Majesty’s Govern ment* i\t the same time the Political Resident ,who was waiting at Koweit ^was 5nstime ted to approach the Sheikh as soon as the necessary confirmation had been received and to endeavour to obtain the widest possible powers. 18. His majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad replied on March 11 that he had been unable to discuss the matter with Iraqi Ministers owing to their preoccupation with other natters but had, however, ascertained from the Financial Adviser that it would be hopeless to expect the Iraqi Government to negotiate on the basis suggested by His Majesty’s Government as they were convinced that a British Director of Customs (who would probably not be appointed for some months) could not establish effective control without the administrative authorit of the Sheikh behind him* Unless either tariff equalisation or limitation by quota of certain imports into Koweit were adopted in advance of his appointment the Iraqis believed nothing but procrastination would result. Sir F. Ilumphrys feared that if His Majesty’s Government could make no advance onijieir proposals there seemed no alternative to allowing the Iraqi..# *.1 l Iraqi Government to take any legally permissible measures to end the snuggling. 19. The political Resident was consequently compelled to leave Xoweit without approaching the Sheikh on the smuggling question. The delay which would be caused by the loss of this opportunity was pointed out to Bagdad in a despatch (Mo.206 of ilareh 14) and the policy of His majesty's Government was once more explained. Sir F# Hunphrys was informed that -» (a) His Majesty's Government had every intention of mediating between Hie parties and hoped that this fact would moderate the Iraqi insistence on an immediate drastic solution. (b) The appointment of a Customs Director at Koweit was not considered as a complete remedy in itself, but as mi opening move in advance of Hie system of customs control (yet to be devised by agreement) which he would liave to work. His Majesty's Government would do their utmost to see that he enjoyed the necessary administrative authority. (c) The proposal to the Sheikh would, be for him to open negotiations with the Iraqi Government (under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government) on the understanding that a British Customs Director would be appointed. But the Sheikh could not be approached until the Iraqi Government had accepted this basis and abandoned their insistence on their own rigid solutions. (d) His Majesty's Government could not agree to either of the two Iraqi ^principles” of tariff equalisation or unconditional limitation of imports into Koweit. mi agree ment on other lines must be sought• (e) ...♦ 2510A27/ 91* (e) If the Sheikh rejected this procedure the Iraqi Government would be free to take whatever legal steps they chose to deal i¥itli the problem* FART III , PRESENT POSITION * 20. On his aiTival in Bagdad Sir A* Clark Kerr lost no time in conferring on the smuggling question with Muri Pasha the competent Iraqi authorities. In his despatch No.198 of April ll f supported by a private letter to Nr. Aendel, he makes an urgent plea for His Majesty* s Governaent to intervene quickl; and decisively to put an end to the smuggling problem. Satisfactory features of the despatch are that the Iraqi Govern** ment - (1) Appear to be in a more conciliatory mood; tlxere is no 1 talk of coercion although it is difficult to reconcile Muri Pasha’s remarks as reported in paragraphs 4-5 ?;ith the repeated threats emanating m the Iraqi autliorities in the| last year. (2) Appear now genuinely anxious that His majesty’s Govern^ meat should exercise effective mediation (paragraphs 4,8) (5) : cimit that the s/iuggliEr.' is mainly carried on by Iraqil and tiiat ,f action should more properly be taken in Iraq n (paragraph 5 S ) although they sutait that in practice there are good reasons for tackling the problem from within Koweit, (4) Accept tlie British Customs Director as a sine qua non of a settlement and are only concerned to see that he has wide powers (paragraph 9). (5) Repeat (albeit vaguely) their promise to compensate the Sheikh (paragraph 12). 21. On the other hand, the despatch 4s not altogether satisfactory in the following respects:- (a) . # #»(a* it accepts tee Iraqi view without reservation (para graph 4-5) but overstates the case against Koweit (paragraph 16) ' the ® eonaBy of which terdly be said to rest »alaost entirely' on the illicit activities of Eoweitis. (Koweit has always been a tribal entrepot and this r51.e is likely to develop greatly if when the Saudi blockade is withdrawn)* &lt;b) Vne lrS - qi authorities ^ still unable to distinguish between a proper preventive service on their side of the frontier and a blockade on the Saudi model (paragraphs 5 &amp; 1 ^ C/ / ht xxh ' il :j ’ overmeat still believe that their system f °‘ 1 ' iJ1 ‘’ lnS i ° po:i ‘ ts iat0 Kowelt by quotas provides the only permanent solution (paragraph 5) and they are now trying to secure acceptance f this through the proposed director of customs having power to take restrictive measures (paragraph 9.) 22.

(c) His vajesty’s Government have decided to mediate in the dispute on the lines set out in paragraph 19 above.

(b) Conceding that the proposed Koweiti preventive servlee be kept independent, although working in harmony with the Iraqi Customs authorities (Colonel Fowls has already accepted this in principle).

Colonel Fowl© 1 8 telegram No.153 of the 4th February to Mr. Laithwalt#* f« Nr. ..^enclel stated that from the recent correspondence on this ruestion he had gained the impression that the Irani Government, on the one hand, had failed to make any acceptable suggestions for the settlement of this problem and to take even such action as lay entirely within their own power to prevent smuggling into Iraqi but that the Sheikh, on the other tend, had by his obstructive tactics put himself in a position in which it was Impossible for His Majesty’s Government to take up hi® case wholeheartedly with the Iraqi Government. I $./5. Kernelt -ras, of course, both politically and economically, an artificial creation, and was subject to continuous pressure from Saudi-Arab!a and Iraq. Sir Andrew :yan had shown very strikingly by his Imaginary dialogue between Ibn Baud and the Sheikh what a power of attraction or pressure Saudi Arabia could exercise on Kowelt and it was probable that, if the Sheikh were left to his own resources, it would be to his interest to let himself be absorbed by one or other of his neighbours. In view, however, of the •strategic importance of Koweit to His rajesty’s Government, the interest of Hi a Majesty’s Government lay in preserving the independence of the Sheikhdom* -and Mr. iiendel was seriously inclined to doubt whether His Majesty’s Government could any longer secure this end by pursuing their nineteenth century policy of keeping others out of Koweit while themselves declining responsibility for the administration of the Sheikhdom. 4. With reference to the latest proposals which had been made .Mr# Rendel was inclined to doubt whether a direct discussion between the Sheikh and the King of Iraq would further the solution of the smuggling problem. Such a meeting might indeed be used as an opportunity for further anti-British intrigue similar to that which had occurred when the Sheikh visited Bagdad in. 1932. It might also, like the previous visit, give rise to difficulties in connexion with a return visit by the King of Iraq. It was at all events certain that, even if any direct arrangement regarding smuggling were arrived at by this means, Koweit could not put it into effect without assistance, since the necessary administrative machinery did not exist there. 5. The first step, therefore, was to provide Koweit withthe necessary organisation, and to achieve this object the appointment of a British Controller of the ioweit Customs was essential* Such an official must be given wide powers and a free hand. The Sheikh’s personal part in the settlement of this problem must be considerably reduced, and this was desirable not only in the c tse of this particular question but also generally on grounds of His Majesty Government’s own interest. The Saudi blockade question, for example, would be far more easily settled if the Sheikh could be eliminated* 6# hr. Rondel therefore suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that the appointment of an adequately equipped Controller of Customs was essential, if His Majesty’s Government were to help him in solving the a mggllng problem* The Sheikh should be told that, if he refused to agree to this appointment, His Majesty’s Government could only leave him to resist the aggressive designs of Iraq and Saudi Arabia unaided, as beat he could* 7. Such a threat would of course be to some extent bluff, since Hie Majesty’s Government could not in fact afford to abandon Koweit, and the Sheikh must know this. On the other hand, although the independence of Koweit was, in view of recent development© in the Persian Gulf and Iraq a first class interest of His Majesty’s Government, they could not adequately defend it with their present weapons* Mr. Ben&amp;el felt very strongly that His Majesty’s Government / must either advance or retreat from their present unsatisfactory position in ICowelt, whereby their relations with the Sheikh’s neighbours, especially with Ibn Sand, were perpetually at the mercy of his bad faith and shiftiness* He thought that His Majesty’s Government should take this opportunity of obtaining closer control at the source of the trouble, particularly/particularly as it had already been agreed in principle that their ultimate policy should, h© to try to tighten up their hold on Koweit and their control over the Sheihh. hrJbaithwaite agreed that the position was one of difficulty and that the Sheikh had not heen very co—operative• On the other hand, in considering the application of sanctions to him, it could not he overlooked that His Majesty's •government ware themselves at the moment in an unsatisfactory position, since it was always open to the Sheikh to reply to suggestions that he was not co-operating actively with them that His Majesty's Government had entirely failed to implement their undertakings m regards the Koweit date gardens in Iraq# It was common ground between the foreign Office and. the India Office that it was essential to dispose of the question of the date gardens as soon as possible hut cases such as the present were another illustration of the embarrassing effect of this dispute on our relations with Koweit. 9. So far as the question immediately before the meeting was concerned, he thought that the argument© advanced by Colonel Fowls against an official conference at Bagdad without the prior consent of the Sheikh were decisive and it looked as though Sir Francis Humphry©, after discussion with the Resident took the same view. On this assumption, the questions for decision were: (a) whether His Majesty's Government should adopt the course of action suggested in Bushire despatch of 8th January, Ho.f0-8; (b) what line was to be taken as regards the suggested visit of the Sheikh to King Gha&amp;l* 10, As regards the first of these questions it ‘fas, of course, quite possible that in the long run there might be nothing/nothing for it but to take action on the lines now suggested by the iml&amp;Mit and apparently accepted by Sir Francis Humphry®* But it went without saying that if the Sheikh proved obstinate and if Iraa in consequence took retaliatory action on the lines referred to in paragraph 2 of Bagdad despatch of 16th December, a very serious situation would arise; and that sooner or later it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Crovemment to avoid intervening to re-establish friendly relations between Iraq, and 'Rowelt. It was relevant, too, that while it would no doubt be recognised in Rowelt that the Sheikh was himself to blame for provoking retaliatory action by Iraq, some of the odium seemed likely to fall on His Majesty’s Government* In these circumstances it seemed desirable to make every effort to explore alternatives, and on the information available there seamed no reason why, with some degree of goodwill on both sides, a satisfactory via media should not be found* ^ Lelthwalte said that in the first place the correspondence made it clear that legally the burden of preventing smuggling across the Rowelt-Irao frontier rested on Iraq; that in fact the actual smugglers were largely If not entirely Iraqis; and that the smuggling- was organised in Basra* Secondly, it seemed clear that the existing preventive organisation on the Koweit-Irac frontier was quite inadequate* The 'helkh had already made proposal® which, if accepted (and supplemented by the appointment of a competent customs official) would apparently go a very long way to dispose of the question of smuggling by sea* He agreed that the Sheikh’s proposals did not dispose of the question of smuggling by land. But while that was primarily a, question for Irao, what werethe oojeetion© to the establishment of a small preventive organisation “by Iraf| on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch of SOth Movemher to Bagdad? The cost would not be very great, and, would be the less important if the financial loss to Iraq consequent on the smuggling was really as serious m was suggested. In reply to a question from • iu Hendel . he agreed that it would be important that Koweit should make some effort to co-operate with such an organisation. But if the Sheikh was prepared to accept a Director of Customs, there seemed no reason why a system of manifest® should not be worked in respect of consignments sent by land and no doubt theDirector, if he was a man of some little standing, might be able ultimately to establish good working relations with his opposite number in Iraq* 12. He agreed that there was much to be said for the appointment of a Director of Customs* But this was a question on which it would be necessary to consult the Heaidant and probably the 0overiment of India before a decision could be taken. There was, however, no reason why we should not at once ask Colonel Fowle for his opinion as to the Sheikh’s probable reaction to such a proposal. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that in the circumstances which had been discussed it sight be worth while to make a further effort to reach a reasonable settlement of this dispute on the lines which he had indicated. It was, he thought, common ground that hie Majesty’s Government would be opposed for political reasons to any customs union between Kuweit and, Iraq, or (fox' reasons which had already been explained to the Embassy} to any form of Joint customs control. This had, perhaps, never been made clear in so many words and it/it might he worth while touching on it. It might also be worth while to make It clear that Hie Majesty’s Government would see no objection to the establishment of a line of poets along the Koweit-Iraa frontier. '/hile there was admittedly the risk that such a line might develop into a land blockade, the danger of this would be much diminished if the poets were set up as part of a joint friendly arrangement between Iran and Koweit, negotiated through His Majesty’s Government. 15. As regards the visit of King Ohazi, the India Office were alive to the difficulties to which Mr. Mendel had referred, but they were Impressed by the strong recommendation of the Resident and the fact that his view was shared by Sir Francis Humphry®. It would, of course, be important to discourage any question of a return visit and equally there could be no question of His Majesty’s Government approving any form of agreement between Koweit and Iraq. 14. 31r Archibald Clark Kerr said that he thought an the whole that there was a reasonable case for exploring the compromise solution that had been suggested. 15. The meeting then discussed the line of policy to be adopted in the immediate future and it was agreed that telegrams should be despatched to Bagdad and Buahir© embodying the conclusion© arrived at. Copies of the drafts of these telegrams, which were subsequently prepared by the India Office, are attached to this record.aediate r^t^een V&amp;. Xra^i tto mment asi thz JkQikb in tid© ^ueation.

J, Sir F* Humphiys, Bagdad* Ko. |iy,..Air MaiX &lt; March 15th* India Ofi'ice first for concurrence. Copy: i.o. with ref: March Sir, On receiving lour Excellency^ telegram Hdf 82 of the 11 th March I was considerably disappointed to learn that you had not found it possible to pursue with the Iraqi Govern ment the question of smuggling between Koweit and Iraq. As you will have seen from the Political Resident’s telegram Ho of March, Colonel Powle was finally obliged to leave Koweit without being able to discuss this important matter with iaa Sheikh; a further opportunity of doing so cannot, unfortunately^arise until, at the earliest, some time after Colonel Fowle's return from India at the end of March. More over, in view of the forthcoming negotiations between the SheiKh and representatives of the Saudi Government regarding the Saudi blockade V Oj. Koweit end also the necessity for taking the Sheikh to task at an early date in connexion/connexion with his illicit negotiations with Messrs Traders, Limited, over the Koweit oil concession, it may not now he possible for His Majesty's Goverment to bring pressure on the Sheikh over the smuggling question till well after that date# 1/i 1 I W ^ ^ 2 , From certain of the observations con tained in your telegram under reference, i conclude that my telegram Ho. 84 of the 6 th March did not make the position of His Majesty's Government in this matter entirely clear. In the first place. His Majesty's Government have eveiy intention of attempting to mediate j between the Iraqi Government and the Sheikh | in this question. Indeed, their present aril 3 a . - ,i no .&lt;■■■ ■ approach to the Iraqi Government is the first step in such mediation. Further, I sincerely hope that, if the Iraqi Government can be brought to realise that His Majesty’s Government will now be taking an active part in the settlement of/of this dispute, direct negotiations between themselves and the Sheikh having reached a ueadiock, they will modify their present con viction tcia t only the immediate adoption of one oi the drastic solutions at present proposed by them can prevent an unreasonable delay. 5. Secondly, I wish to make it clear taat His Majesty’s Government are not proposing the appointment of a Customs Director at Koweit as in itself a panacea for the present situation. They fully, x^ealise that the Iraqi Government cannot be expected to regard such an appointment in this light. They are nevertheless convinced that the creation of this post is an indispensable part of any eventual solution of the smuggling dispute, and the Iraqi Government themselves will no doubt admit that, in order that any system of Customs control which may hereafter be devised by agreement between the two parties may work properly, it will be necessary for the Sheikh to set up adequate and reliable administra tive machinery for this purpose. It therefore seems/seems reasonable that His Majesty’s Government should make this appointment the sJ.ne .guajion of any settlement, when dealing with the Sheikh. As has been already pointed out in paragraph 4 of India Office telegram Bo. 664 of the 1st March to the Political Resident, the creation of the post of Customs Director in Koweit would also serve other Useful purposes, notably in regard to the regulation of trade between Koweit and Saudi Arabia, and to the. operations of the Koweit Oil Company. I may add that, if a Director should be appointed, he will naturally have the administrative sanction of the Sheikh behind him, and all the influence of His Majesty’s Government will be exerted to ensure that he is fully supported in the execution of his duties. It is thereiore unnecessary for the Irapi authorities to fear that such an appointment will be no more than a faf&amp;de. * • 4. Vvhile, therefore, they regard the appointment of a Customs Director as an essential/essential part of any scheme for the regula tion of eoiamerci&amp;l relations between Koweit and Iraq, His Majesty’s Gtovernment do not propose to rest content with the Sheikh's consent to this one measure: indeed, it is doubtful whether the Sheikh himself would in fact, agree to make this appointment unless as part of a satisfactory settlement with the &lt;Iragi Government,in spite of the other advantages to be derived from it. The main proposal put to him would be.that he should ^ enter/upon negotiations with the Iraqi Govern ment under the auspices of His Majesty's Government simply on the understanding that the appointment of a Customs Direc tor would be regarded by His Majesty's Government as a necassaiy part of any such settlement. For the reasons given in my telegram Np. 84,however, it is quite impossible for His Majesty's Government to approach the Sheikh until they are reasonably certain that, if he agrees to this ?, . procedure/procedure, the Iraqi Government will not oppose it or virtually refuse by attaching onerous conditions to their acceptance. It is natural, to be expected that such negotiations will take time; nevertheless, as suggested lnP‘ paragraph 2 above, it may be hoped that the influence of His Majesty’s Government on both parties will lead to a rather more rapid settle of the present controversy than the present policy of direct negotiation seems likely to ensure. Meanwhile the Iraqi Government are not entitled to claim an immediate acceptance by the Sheikh of terms suggested by themselves. If His Majesty's Government are to (mediate, it must be on a basis of free discussion between the parties to the dispute. AS a preliminary to such discussion they now request the Iraqi Government -to agree in principle to negotiate with the Sheikh, under the ir auspices, on the assurance that an integral part of any such settlement will be the consent of th&lt; an administrative measure which they camo IT ^ K ^ * Kt'A l/ j*, . te ^ , V ' d'wrv 1 realise/realise to be in taeir own interest. In the last- ..-esort, if, after oomideriug such measures of compromise as ids majesty’s Government hope that it will be possible to evolve during the negotiations, they aevertneiess remain of opinion that only one or both of. the ex time measures which they are at px^esent proposing will satisfactorily end their present difficul ties, then they will, in principle, be entitled to return to their original, demands. 1 should* however, state plainly at this point that, for the reasons which have already been given in the course of previous telegraphic correspondence on the subject. His Majesty's Government will not be able to agree to any unconditional limitation of imports into Rowelt or to any proposal for the equalisation of the Koweit tariff with that of Iraq. at the same time, I consider that it should not be beyond the ingenuity of t,ie negotiators to devise some acceptable compromise which would effectually suppress contraband trade between Koweit and Iraq without in anyway impairing the Sheikh’s sovereign rights: consideration will certainly he given to any tsea sures which the Iraqi Government wish to propose. 6* The above proposal is, of course, subject in the dast resort to the assumption that both parties will show themselves reasonable before and during the negotiations. His Majesty’s Government do not discount the possibility that, even if the Iraqi Government now agree to the procedure which I have suggested, the Sheikh may refuse to do so. If he should refuse or if he should delay unreasonably in giving Ms consent. His Majesty’s Government will not be in a posi tion to defend him further, and they will not be able to object if the Iraqi Govomment take whatever measures they see fit, however drastic those measures may be, provided always that they do not exceed the bounds permitted by international practice. Nevertheless, although the most favourable moment which is lively to occur for some time for raising this matter with the ^ Sheikh has now slipped by. His Majesty’s Govern ment hope that, after further consideration ofthe proposals which they are now making, the Iraqi Government will not refuse to accept their present oiler of mediation, which cannot commit them to any solution of which they do not approve and may be the means of ending without unnecessary ilx-reeling or expense on both sides a dispute which has already been allowed to drag on too long. I shall accordingly be glad if Your Excellency will make strong representations to the Iraqi Government in this sense and in the sense of paragraph 8 of my telegram ho. 84. 6.

The Cabinet are so engrossed in the grave situation that has arisen &amp;£ middle Euphrates (see my telegram No« 60) that there is no possibility of further discussion with responsible Ministers before Political Resident in the Per sian Gulf is due to leave Koweit. I am informer, however, by Mr. Hogg that it is hopeless to expect that IracpL Grovern' 1 - rent would be willing to discuss settlement of smuggling questions on basis of appointment of Hritish Customs Director of Koweit alone&lt;&gt; Their objections to this course are (1) several months will probably elapse before director is in stalled, (2) Director cannot do anything to control smuggling without the administrative sanction of Sheikh be hind him and would be regarded by Iraq.! G-overmnent as a mere facade, (3) unless one or other of principles suggested by Iraqi Government is adopted in advance of director s appoint ment (details of course would have to be discussed later) they are convinced nothing but procrastination will result« I am aware that Sheikh of Koweit is limited by treaty to 4% import duty on British goods but I regard this stipulation in the present circumstances as an anachronism when import duty levied by neighbouring states on such an article as sugar, is at least 25 times greater than maximum imposed on Koweit by our treaty. As regards second alternative Iraqi.Iraqi Government are not seeking to impose arbitrary limita tion on the Sheikh hut asking that he should invite Sug gestions on restriction by license on articles principally smuggled into Iraq alter Koweit’s needs have been met a In this Iraq-Koweit controversy we have an excellent opportunity to exercise our genius for mediatioin If we let slip opportunity such as this I foresee the time when force of circumstances will compel us to relinquish our exclusive position in Kcweito I have restrained Iraqi Government tor many months from taking drastic action in denying that something more might be done to ease the situation and if His Majesty’s Government are unable at this stage to press for anything more than appointment of a British director of customs in Koweit there seems no alternative but to allow Iraqi Govern ment to take their own measures provided that they are legal to put a stop to an intolerable situation a This will probably mean that blockade of Koweit will be complete* I cannot see that there is anything arbitrary, hostile or dictatorial in Iraqi Government's present attitude.

Owing to resignation of the Cabinet I have been unable until now to discuss Koweit smuggling with Iraqi Government.

IMPORTANT, PART II 0 Iraqi Government consider that the only alternative to restriction of import into Koweit of the seven articles mentioned is the establishment of an efficient preventive service which owing to the absence of any physical feature on boundary practically amounts to a blockade. This would only lead to the embitterment of relations between Koweit and Iraq and is I submit contrary to common sense since the plain fact is that excess of imports should not be allowed into Koweit at all. For the last fifteen months Iraqi Government have deferred taking active measures on the lines adopted oy Ibn Saud in the hope that through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government Sheikh would be brought to reasonable frame of rnind 0 It is probably true that Iraqi customs officials have committed illegal acts in Koweit waters but it is a complete misunderstanding of the position and facts to say that the obvious (grp, undec,) of the Iraqi Govern ment for the last three years has been to bully the Sheikh into co-operation, Iraq genuinely desires to live • • 6m3 2. live on the best of terms with Koweit hut expects neighbourly conduct from Sheikh. She regards it as a definitely unfriendly act that the Sheikh should allow large quantities of goods to he imported into his country which he knows can only he intended to he smuggled into Iraq. If blockade is established I do not think Iraq will deliberately cut off Koweit water supply. As, however, blockade entails prohibiting entry of Koweitis into Iraq territory, restrictions.!.on entry of Koweiti boats into Iraqi territorial waters must necessarily follow/. This w/ill mean in practice restrictions on movement of Koweiti water boats and a heavy increase in cost of their operations. Iraqi Government are fully determined to take every effective defensive measure they can to preserve their interests. Unless Kis Majesty’s Government can bring about some amelioration in the present position it is inevitable that Iraq w/ill shortly demand a representative of her owm to reside in Koweit and it will be difficult to resist the justice of her claim. To sum up. If useless cost and embitterment of relations are to be avoided the Sheikh must be persuaded to agree to appointment of British director of customs in Kow/eit and restriction of import of the seven specified articles to bona fide requirements of his people. On their part Iraqi Government w/ill be ready to assist him financially. These in my opinion are basic principles of any lasting solution and time is running short.(E 1549/127/91) fv I Mi- Cypher telegram to Sir F. Humphrys (Bagdad), Foreign Office, 8 th March, 1955* 6.00 p*m. No. 84. IMPORTAN 1 !!, Your telegram No. 58 (af March 6 th: Koweit-Iraq smuggling)« I am glad to note from final paragraph of part 2 of your telegram which has presumably been repeated to Political Resident and Government of India that you consider that Iraqi Government would be prepared to agree to a solution based on appointment of British Director of Customs in Koweit; and on this assumption His Majesty^ Government are prepared to press the Sheikh strongly to accept such an official. 2. On the other hand this agreement appears to be qualified by continued insistence on unconditional limita tion of imports. It is hardly possible for His Majesty’s Government to press the Sheikh to accept, at the dictation of Iraqi Government, a scheme which would amount to a severe rationing of his principal imports, since this would amount to a virtual renunciation of his independent rights, to maintenance of which His Majesty's Government attach greatest importance, and would involve practically complete stoppage even of his legitimate transit trade. On latter point, although His Majesty's Government realise that efficient customs control may result in substantial diminutiondiminution of imports into Koweit, they cannot accept jraoi suggestion that there can he no legitimate importation into t oweit of articles named in Iraqi special list, except insofar as they are required for local Koweiti consumption. They believe that, provided economic relations of foweit with Saudi Arabia can be established on normal basis, Koweit's natural position as an entrepot may be expected to assert itself. 5, His Majesty's Government consider that a satisfactory scheme for preventing illegitimate export of goods from Koweit can be evolved without arbitrary and unconditional limitation of imports. Detailed scheme will have to be worked out between Political authorities in the Gulf in consultation with the Sheikh, with His Majesty's Embassy in Bagdad and with the Iraqi Government (in consultation with their British advisers). ^ 4„ It must however be made quite clear that His majesty Government cannot agree to any arrangement which would involve the raising of the Koweiti tariff to the Iraqi level (you will remember that by treaty the Sheikh is lifted to 4, on Britis goods) and that any arrangement for limitation of imports or fixing of maximum quota in respect of individual articles would be acceptable only if framed in such a way as not to derogate from Sheikh’s independent rights. 5, In these circumstances you will appreciate that, . 1 „ 4- n hrins: ores sure to hear on bheikh although they are willing to hri .g to settle with Iraqi Qovement on reasonahle terns, uis Majesty's Government cannot do so until the, are assnred that Iraqi Government for their cart will ahandon their r«i insistenee on on, particular set of measures, ' and unconditional limitation of imports at Iraqi dxotatr n,3. will be prepared to negotiate some alternative but equally effective solution. Without such assurance it is useless for His Majesty’s Government to approach Sheikh, while to give it need not in any way debar Iraqi Government from reverting later to their present demands, if negotiations on reasonable basis fail, 6 . Urgency of matter is due to threats of Iraqi Government, How that His Majesty’s Government are actively intervening, I trust that these can, for the time at any rate, be laid aside. His Majesty’s Government have no objection to creation of strong Iraqi preventive force on frontier, which would indeed form part of any proposal of theirs for a settlement. Cannot Iraqi Government budget for institution of such a force at once? This might help to reassure their own public opinion and might also help His Majesty's Government in persuading Sheikh to be reasonable, 7. Meanwhile I shall be glad if either with or without further consultation with Iraqi authorities you will confirm at earliest possible moment that Iraqi Government will be willing to discuss settlement of this question on basis of appointment of British or British Indian Customs Director of Koweit without prejudice to further details of scheme which will be freely worked out between interested parties and His Majesty’s Government, Addressed to Bagdad No. 84, repeated to Political Resident at Bushire No. 20 and Government of India No. 34.Under secretary of State, Koweit-Irao smuRgling; please see previous submission on P.2.1441/35 and the subsequent correspondence.

Owing to resignation of the Cabinet I have been unable until now to discuss Eoweit smuggling with Iraqi Government. I have today discussed your modified proposals with advisers and Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance. They are most grateful that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to take positive action with the Sheikh but are keenly disappointed at what they consider to be total inadequacy of proposals which are to be put to him and have given me to understand that these are no more acceptable now than they were when I sent my telegram No. 47. The contention of Iraqi Government, in which they are strongly supported by their British advisers, is that imports into Koweit of “ugar, tea, matches, coffee, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette paper are now approximately ten times greater solely for the purpose of smuggling and Iraq is by far the greatest sufferer® This is a fact and not a mere assumption as there are no licit exports whatever of these goods from Koweit. Unless therefore imports can be restricted to ) bona fide requirements for Koweit the root of the evil will remain. than quantities which Koweit can consume. IjifotZO ■ ~~i X.? *4.

EAHO.L Iraqi Government consider that the only alternative preventive service which owing to the absence of any physical feature on boundary practically amounts to a blockade. This would only lead to the embitterment of relations between Koweit and Iraq and is I submit contrary to common sense since the plain fact is that excess of imports should not be allowed into Koweit at all. For the last fifteen months Iraqi Government have deferred taking active measures on the lines adopted by ibn Saud in the hope that through the good offices of It is probably true that Iraqi customs officials complete misunderstanding of the position and facts to say that the obvious (grp, undec*) of the Iraqi Govern ment for the last three years has been to bully the Sheikh into co-operation, Iraq genuinely desires to live .,,2 live on the best of terms with Koweit hut expects neighuourly conduct from Sheikh„ She regards it as a defiiiioely uiu.riendly act that the Sheikh should allow large quantities of goods to he imported into his country which he knows can only he intended to he smuggled into Iraq. if blockade is established I do not think Iraq will deliberately cut off Koweit water supply. As, however, blockade entails prohibiting entry of Koweitis into Iraq territory, restrictionsj.on e^uxg of koweibi boats into Iraqi territorial waters 'mast .necessarily follow. This will mean in practice restrictions on movement of Koweiti water boats and a heavy increase in cost of their operations. Iraqi Government are sully determined to take every effective de±ensive measure they can to preserve their interests. Unless Iiis Majesty's Government can bring about some amelioration in the present position it is inevitable unab Iraq will shortly demand a representative of her own to reside in Koweit and it will be difficult to resist the justice of her claim. To sum up. if useless cost and embitterment of relations are to be avoided the Sheikh must be persuaded to agree to appointment of British director of customs in Koweit and restriction of import of the seven speciiied articles to bona fide requirements of his people. On their part Iraqi Government will be ready to assist him financially. These in my opinion are basic principles of any lasting solution and time is running short.kjn/rc/aw. -ILjP-C YPHER OP TaLBGHAM, From (COPIES CIRCULATED) Dated Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India* Bushire s 3rd March, 1935* Received 3rd March, 1935, 8*10 p # m* XXX IMPOST AHT . \U\* Pirat of Two Parts. 256.

That, in this (? matter) in which British interests were not directly involved and which was therefore Sheikh* s own responsibility, we gave him strong advice to offer a measure of co-operation which he refused to do (if this is his final attitude). To converse criticism: that we applied pressure on Sheikh to accept Iraq proposals in Iraqi interests, it seems to me we have no reply, 2. Your paragraph Bo.3 (o). sheikh's conduct 'not irreproachable', it is true that he was stupid over suggested Baghdad conference of February 1934 (vide correspondence ending with ay express letter 192-8, of the 20th Pebruary, 1934) but his actual conduct vis-a-vis Iraq has been studiously oorrect. Under international law he is not bound to co-operate with Iraq Government - vide, for instance. Foreign Office Despatch Bo.780, Bovember 12th, 1934, to Baghdad. In spite of this, Iraq customs authorities have for the last 3 years pursued deliberate policy of a succession (? of, omitted) illegal, high handed and brutal acts which have involved ill-treatment, woundingwounding suid killing of Kowsiti subjects witb tbe obvious of aim/(? bullying) Sheikb into co-operation, if sbeikh bad taken law into his own hands (he has half a dozen armed Jcrd vanettes) or encouraged his people to do so and Iraqi customs guards had been shot, His Majesty*s Government would have had very serious situation on their hands. 3heikh p however, nas quite correctly merely made protests through His Majesty s Government.

I am of opinion that) this would do harm rather than good as giving public impression that Sheikh was a martyr. lhat I have in mind (if Sheikh does not agree to co-operate) is to let it be known, not only in Koweit but all along the Arab coast (where the affair will arouse considerable comment), that Sheikh has acted against His Majesty’s Government s advice in not adopting a measure of co-operation which appears reasonable to them and that, therefore, naturally they can accept no responsibility for result. 4. I hold no particular brief for Sheikh, whose conduct on various occasions m past has been irritatir^ I feel, however, that in present matter, a rebuke from His Majesty's Government, which would seem to Mm unmerited, would lessen the 0ff9ot of aenBure in tiie oase of traders ((? which should) come '‘s Government vide my letter C.323 dated December/2 December 21st )ia which he was definitely at fault. 5,.

Johnstone, Esq. f Foreign Office.mte Paper, political Department, Please see previous submission on P.z.835/35 below. The views, of the Ambassador at Baghdad and of Colonel Powle on the via media which the Foreign Office and India Office proposed on that paper are contained in Baghdad telegram No.47 of 19th February (P.Z.1344/35 flagged) and Bushire telegram of 36th February (P.Z.1373/35). Baghdad are not prepared to make any concession and threaten immediate sanctions unless their demands are accepted in full. Bushire express no definite view as to the Sheikh's probable reaction to a proposal for a Director of Customs and see nothing for it but the course of action originally suggested by colonel Fowle, viz., the despatch of a letter to the sheikh: (a) recapitulating the proposals of the Iraq Government; (b) recapitulating the measures which the Sheikh is willing to put into effect to deal with smuggling by sea; (c) intimating that the Iraq Government are not prepared to accept (b) and setting out in detail the sanctions which they propose to apply; (d) adding that those sanctions are legal and that H.M.G. cannot help the sheikh if they are put into force, and enquiring (e) whether in these circumstances the Sheikh wishes to make any advance on his nronos«is. The question was discussed at two meetings at the Foreign Office yesterday. The objections to allowing an open and very serious breach between these two States, the odium for which would certainly fall on/2 4i \ ■ v'] €L T.. ,4 l : HH on were regarded as being as strong as ever. Both India Office and Foreign Office agreed, too, that the Iraq Government could not he allowed to take punitive action on the lines suggested - particularly as they had themselves made no real effort to deal with the smuggling problem on the Iraqi side of the frontier. The Foreign Office intimated, however, that while they were quite prepared to overrule the | Ambassador and to take a strong line with the Iraqis, ; it was in their view essential that the sheikh should first put them (andhimself) on better ground oy agreeing to the appointment of the customs Director, who would i operate a manifest system in respect of land frontiers as well as of imports tiy sea. They remain/of opinion | that it was quite impractical)le. for H.M.G. to keep out j of this question. H.M.G. were hound to come in sooner or later and it was in the view of the Foreign Office far better that they should come in at this stage and endeavour to bring pressure on both the sheikh and the . Iraqis to accept a compromise which would be fair to both parties than for them to stand aside and allow Iraq to impose the sanctions contemplated in the event of the Sheikhas proving obstinate, itiatever they did they might rely upon haying to bear a certain of odium in Iraq. fcew-tZ/- , 3. On the whole, I think the drafts represent the best we can make of tae situation. The Iraqis &lt;TK are so much in the wrong that we cannot help regretting that we should have to apply any pressure to the sheikh But he himself is by no means free from blame. It seem£ clear that some form of customs organisation or control is an essential preliminary to settlement with Iraq (and probably with Saudi Arabia), and we are, I think, justified in bringing strong pressure to bear on him Him.mite Paper.

Ma, , ,Oa/J»OBK OE K.Ui. AIT Si.iCOGi.IMO. The outcome of the meeting of His Excellency Sir Francis H. Humphrys and Messrs. Hogg, oievwright, Bateman ?and Stafford was briefly as follows:- 1. That the Iraqi Government would not put forward any further detailed proposals for the co-operation of the Shaikh in the prevention of smuggling, as the Shaikh had not furn ished any considered reply to the scheme placed before him by the Iraqi delegation which visited him in September last. 2* That the Advisers to the Government have prepared a scheme of which the following are the main principles. These principles, subject to agreement later on details and the figures of quotas and compensation, have been accepted by His Majesty’s Embassy as being fair and reasonable measures which the Shaikh should accept in order to retain the amity of Iraq ;~ (a) The appointment of an experienced British director of Customs at Kuwait, preferably from India, with an adequate staff. One half of the cost of the director and the staff would be defrayed by the Iraqi Government on the understanding that the director would work in the closest co-operation with the Iraqi Customs department* He would send copies of all export licences for goods leaving Kuwait by land or sea to the Iraqi Customs Depart ment and furnish all information reasonably required by the Department for use in the prevention of smuggling* (b) The import of certain articles into Kuwait to be restricted to an annual quota. These commodities are those on which a high fixed rate of duty is chargeable /andana which are known to ha smuggled into Iraq in great quantity. The Iraqi Government should have power to r equire th e shaikh to add other commoditiee to the schedule siiOaj.d smuggling of them become rife. Sugar Tea Matches Coffee Tobacco and Cigarettes Cigarette Paper It is suggested that the import quota should be fixed on a per capita basis and that the amount per capita imported into Iraq, where the standard of living is at least as high as it is in Kuwait, should be regarded as a fair con sumption per capita for Kuwait. The quota should be for such quantities as would be sufficient to allow for the consumption in Kuwait of the amount of the Iraqi per capita Import by each inhabitant of Kuwait. In audition to this ” he ivUWaiti Customs would be empowered to issue import licenses for quantities in excess of the quota required for the legitimate export trade. uuch additional imports would not exceed 10 per cent of the quota and would only be issued after enquiry had elicited that the goods were required for licit commerce. Copies of all such import certificates would be sent to the Iraqi Customs. (e) A joint Kuwaiti-Iraqi preventive service should be established, with power to operate within defined limits in territories of both States, on land and sea. Both States would be represented in the force, which would work in oioao liaison with both Customs Administrations. \&lt;i) In order to reimburse the Shaikh nominally for hie expenses in connection with the joint preventive service and. other measures (but actually to compensate him for losses /whieh'•mien ha Kay Buffer toy the introduction of those manta) the Iraqi Government will pay hiai a lxmp ai»rar*^e- Bi;u&gt;t annually. 3 ' 2t Waa agre3a that ^ Shaikh expressed his wili- ingness to accept these principles they should be put forward to the Iraqi Government by His Majesty's Embassy for their concurrence and for the settlement of details. A time limit should be fixed, as the Iraqi Government were being hard pressed to introduce stern repressive unilateral measures.

Taking into consideration all the various factors involved, which have been set forth in our respective des ate nos we are of opinion that the best course of action to pursue is as follows. 2. That I should address a letter to the Shaikh of Kuwait on the lines indicated in paragraph 10 of my letter quoted above, with the alterations indicated below. (a) /.s in my letter* - (b) As in y letter. (c) AS in my let er down to “counter-measures ‘. The actual measures, some or all of which the Iraq Government may be forced in their own defence to put into effect would be enumerated generally as followss (1) Tot il prohibition of imports from Kuwait. (2) The streif thening of the armed forces a trolling p the land frontier of Iraq. - The Hon * hie Lieut.-Colonel T.0.;&lt;owle t C.B.d.-, Political Resident in the Persian Gull.', The foreign decr^t ry j to the Government of India, Tew Delhi•(4) withdrawal ox tue valuable at present extenuea to Kuwaiti customs concessions c cxiir.ierce • In the last neii.ed category are inclnaed the privileges oi export 0.1 goods iro , Iraq to Kuwait out 01 bona and unuer drawback iree ox customs and excise duty, and tlie concessions admissible to goods in transit, all oi which privileges can be resti'icteu or withdrawn by Government Regulations* (d) ns in my letter* (e) as in m, f letter* (t) (tew) • That ii the shaikh is prepared, to consider making any advance on his present proposals the following are measures which His excellency has reason to believe might be acceptable to the Iraqi Government; (1) The appointment of an experienced British director | of Customs at Kuwait, preferably xrom India, with an adequate staff* tne halx of the cost of the director and the staff woulo be aei'r yed by the Iraqi dovern- j ment cm Uie unaerstanding that the director would work in the closest co-operation with the Iraqi Customs Be ,artme. .t* he would semi copies of all export licences for goods leaving Kuwait by land or sea to the Iraqi Customs department and furnish all informa tion reasonably required by the Depart ent for use in the prevention of smug^lix-g.

Both States would be represented in the force, which would work in close liaison with both Customs -dmiuistrations.-4- which is as follows j In order to reimburse the Shaikh nominally for his expenses in connection with the joint preventive service and other measures (but actually to compensate him for losses which he ma^ suffer by the introduction of these arrange ments) the Iraqi Government will pay him a lump sum an ually. This measure, however, will not be communicated to the dliaikh in my letter. 5. In audition to the Iraqi pro os Is in (f), there is another which the ohaikh might himself put . orward: i.«. one on the lines of that which he made to Ibn Gaud some time ago vide my despatch Ho#44 (?57~i to dovenuaent of India), dated 27th June 1933 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State 3 or the Colonies, i.e. that the Iraq Government shoulo. keep a certain number of Customs posts on the Kuwaiti-Iraq frontier, and tliat the Shaikh would guarantee that all caravans leaving- Kuwait should, pass through these posts. Sir Francis Humphry* and I, however, are of opinion that, since it is doubtful whether the Iraqi government would agree to this proposal, it would be better for it to emanate from the Shaikh, and it seems not unlikely that he may make it of his own accord since he referred to it in the enclosure to His dxcellenoy’s despatch Ho.711, dated the 16th December 1934, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for foreign Affairs.

It is essential to keep Koweit out of the lraql ° rMt * in this s ense made by Iraqi Government since 19 f j2 are therefore quite unacceptable. o* Manifest system proposed by Sheikh, at any rate if operated r y reliable Director of Cu; toms, appears to go very far to meet sea smuggling. If Sheikh could he persuaded to appoint ^uitablo British or British Indian.as Director would this in your view help to meet Iraqi Government? If so would they be Prepared to contribute to his salary? I agree that Sheikh 1 s proposals do not dispose of Question of land smuggling. International responsibility for topping this rests primarily with Iraqi Government (see my despatch No.780 (of the 12th November)). Smugglers appear in2 * most if not all cases to 'be Irakis and smuggling to be organised in Basra (Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes’ telegram No.55 Saving (of 1st October)) while it is clear that existing preventive organisation on land frontier is quite inadequate (compare Bushire despatch of 20th November). Prima facie step suggested by Political Resident in paragraph 6 of his despatch of 20th November would go far to meet the case. '-bat, if any, are the Iraqi objections to taking action on tho'se lines. I appreciate danger that line of posts might develop into blockade, but this should be lessened if posts were established on lines suggested by Bushire as part of general friendly arrangement. 5. I think best course will be that you should explore informally with nr. bievwright and Iraqi Government possibility of settlement as regards land smuggling on above lines,but without of courseinany way committing His Majesty’s Government or Sheikh as regards appointment of a Director of Customs, which, however, subject to Resident’s comments, His Majesty’s Government will press on Sheikh. Director if appointed could operate system ef manifests in regard to goods consigned over land frontier which, taken Y/ith preventive measures referred to in paragraph 4 above, should in rny viev/ enable Iraqis to establish effective control /without any limitation of imports into Koweit (to v/hich there w Yould be objections), v/itbout transgressions over Koieeit border:, md without payment of compensation to Sheikh (save possibly in aspect of salary of Director of’Customs). • 6. Matter is very urgent and I shall be grateful for earliest possible comments. If no settlement proves practicable m above lines, it may be necessary to fall back on procedure )roposed in Bushire despatch (No.27 Smamg) of the 8th January mt His Majesty’s Government are most reluctant to risk conse- luences suggested in paragraph 2 of your despatch No.711 (of the .6th December) unless this is quite inevitable.

Mr. Rendel, however, wished to place on record that they concur in the second omission with very great reluctance. In their view a stage has now teen reached in dealing with Koweit at which it is necessary either to go forward or to go hack and the Foreign Office attitude is that it is necessary to go forward. M not sure that Colonel Fowle, tnough he was present at the discussions at wnicn future policy in Koweit was examined last year fully appreciates the position and they would have preferred to have given him a stronger lead in the direction of pressing a Director of customs on the Sheikh and to have emphasised that our action in the adopting this line was merely/following out of a policy which had already been considered and approved by H.M.G. 1 indicated to Mr. Rendel the difficulties seen here to the addition in question.

'evious Papersinute Paper political Department. \ the last Tew months with the Foreign Office, India, Bushire and Bagdad, ahout the difficulties which have arisen in connection with smuggling from Koweit into Iraq and in September it proved possible to arrange for a visit by representatives of the Iraq Government, to Koweit to discuss with the Sheikh a possible modus vivendi . Unfortunately the way had not been properly prepared with the Sheikh and His Excellency was not in consequence in a very receptive mood, while matters were made worse by the fact that the Iraqi representatives, instead of coming merely to clear the ground , produced concrete proposals of a type which the Sheikh with reason regarded as quite unacceptable. It has not since been possible to bring the parties together and in December sir Francis Humphrys suggested that the simplest course would be that he and the political Resident should meet at Bagdad to agree a course which the Sheikh should be required to accept. The Political Resident gave decisive arguments against a conference of this nature in his despatch of 8 th January, but suggested the despatch to the sheikh i of a letter intimating that the Iraq Government were threatening, failing the adoption of a more accommodating attitude on the part of the Sheikh, to take very rigorous action against him, such as the imposition|}f a land blockade and the withdrawal of certain customs concessions which Koweit at present enjoys; that the Iraq Government would be within their legal rights in taking such steps; and that if the Sheikh refused to make any advance to meet them 2956 gooo 734 he could look for no assistance from H.M.G. in the event of their being taken.2 r w 3. The G.of I. expressed their general agreement with the Resident's views. As the result of a subsequent conference at Bushire the Resident, In agreement with Sir Francis Humphrys, has suggested that the Sheiidi might he invited to Bagdad by King Ghazi in the hope that some arrangement could be reached over this troublesome question. 4. The matter was considered yesterday at a conferenc at the Foreign Office, at which Sir A. Clerk: Kerr, the Ambassador- Designate, was present. The India Office representative dealt with the matter on the basis of the note for discussion flagged D below, and after considerable argument the general line suggested in that note was accepted by the Foreign'Office*. The draft telegrams now attached to Bagdad ana to Bushire, which have been prepared here as the result of the departmentally 'Conference have been accepted/by the Foreign Office, and are being submitted for consideration. 5. It will be seen that their general line is that we must make a further effort to reach a reasonable settlement of this problem and that,given a little goodwill on the part of the Iraqis and possibly a little pressure on the sheikh on our side/T^hcre seems no reason why it should not be possible to reach an arrangement which would be fair to both parties. There are very strong objections to allowing this controversy to develop into a serious political issue in which we shall nave to intervene whether we like it or not. The Sheikh has not been wholly reasonable and the Iraqis have been if possible more unreasonable. As will be seen, it was thought desirable to make it clear to the Embassy that certain of the Iraqi proposals, , ■ i if unacceptable to the sheikh, are equally unacceptable 1 ji • I pms m to and to concentrate on persuading; s ( a )/ilinute Paper. Department. (a) the Iraqis to agree to certain preventive measures on the Iraq side of the Iraq-Koweit land frontier, which had been suggested dy the Political Resident and which if applied should^at any rate^given some customs cooperation on the Koweit side, go far, if not all the way, to dispose of the difficulties that are experienced; (h) Koweit to cooperate to the extent that the proposals put forward hy the Sheikh for reducing sea smuggling hy the institution of a system of manifests should he accepted, hut that the sheikh should he strongly urged to accept a reliable Director of Customs, either British (which the new Ambassador favoured) or British Indian^as the India Office representative urged at the meeting). The Director would he in general charge of the manifest system in respect of goods passing both hy sea and hy land, and if he was a person of some little standing ana experience it might he expected that he would ultimately establish a certain liaison with his Iraqi opposite number in Bagdad. 6 # The amendments suggested by the Foreign Office in the drafts prepared are shown in manuscript (the manuscript addition to para-7 of the telegram to Bagdad is, however, part of the original draft). I think they are all unobjectionable, with the exception that Mr. Rendel is anxious, on page 2, para.4, of the draft to Bagdad to suggest that the Director of Customs should he “with wide powers'. I do notlike this. The Sheikh of Koweit has always been very reluctant to devolve authority. It may he difficult to persuade him (though i think we ought tolpersuade him) toN 4. I ft ■ i m ■ accept thisiofficial, and I think any suggestion that the official is to have 'wide powers' will on the one hand frighten the Sheikh and on,the other possibly encourage the Irakis in the informal conversations now proposed to anticipate more than they are likely to get. 7 . I submit that I might be authorised to say that we deprecate the amendment discussed in the preceding paragraph, but that otherwise we concur in the draft telegram to Bagdad and will telegraph to Bushire as in the draft attached. The matter is one of great urgency as Sir Francis Humphrys is due to leave there in the near future, and it is desirable that any informal discussions that take place should be initiated while he is still at Bagdad. IT, unfortunately, we fail to make any advance on the line$ now suggested, we shall then have to consider the proposal put forward in the Political hesident’s despatch of 8 th January, No.&amp;Q-s, flagged. But it seems worth making a determined effort to achieve a reasonable solution of this problem before, as the Foreign Office put it in conversation, we encourage the two parties to indulge in a head-on collision with one another.

In regard to the figures set out in paragraphs o 5 of Sir Francis Humphrys* despatch, wnich cover the loss alleged by the Iraqi Customs Department to have been caused to Iraq by smuggling from Kuwait, two comments occur to me. First - that by no means all the contraoand goods captured fcy tiie Iraq Customs are intended for Iraq, a certain portion or it is probably intenued to be re-smuggled into r * Persia from Iraq. Second. With reference to the comparison between Kuwait and Iraq of average import per head. Colonel Jicnsun informed me that the population oi Kuwait inerucuiig tue tribesmen is perhaps nearer 70,000 than 60,000. He also pointed out that since Kuwait - unlike Iraq - gi o\m no whatever in its limits, naturally the imports . ox tire the local population must be considerably higher. However, /- 2 - However, I do not tliink that it woula really serve any useful purjiose to enter into an argument regarding these figures. If the Iraq Government are convinced that they lose large sums annually by smuggling from. Kuwait then ~ since they are the party most affected - from a practical point ox view that is the end of the matter. 2. With reference to the suggestion for a conference made in paragraph 15 on Sir Francis Humphrys 1 despatch. I saw certain objections (vide paragraph 6 of my letter Ho.258-S, dated the 1st March 1934, copy forwarded to the Government of India ana to His hxcellciicy The ambassador, Bagdad, un^er my Fruited Letter No.259-S of same date)to a previous sugges tion that Colonel Dickson and myseli should attend a confer ence at Bagdad, but at any rate we were to be duly authorised by the Shaikh (of Kuwait) to appear on his behalf. The present suggestion, as I unuerstand it, is tnat without authorisation from the Shaikh, or without even informing Colonel Dickson as Poliuxcal Agent Kuwait ana myself as Political Resident should confer officially with tne mrnussy and witii officials of a foreign government - 'Iraq, whom tde Shaikh regards with intense suspicion, on a matter which closely concerns Kuwait. That over the head of the Shaikh we should decide what terms the Iraq efovernneno s^ouLj. 0 ' Lfer him. That these terns snould then he communicated to His Majesty's Government who would inform the Shaikh accor in fa ly 3 3. My objections to a conference of this nature are very strong indeed. Briefly it woula place Colonel Dickson and myself, particularly myself, in a most awkward postmen, is part of my duties as Political Resident on behalf of His Majesty's Government to look after tne interests Shaikh, /“3- Sliaikh, and if I were tu attend a conference such as suggested I aui sure, ^rom my knov/ledge of his character, that he would he genuinely of the opinion that unuer the orders of His Majesty’s Government Colonel Dickson and I had conferred with the Iraq Government to his disadvantage, and that he had been ignored both by His Majesty^ Government and by the Iraq Govern ment* The Shaikh is not unnaturally sensitive of his independ ent position vis &amp; vis Iraq, (he was not a little upset because the visit of the Iraqi representatives to Kuwait in September 1934 was arranged without his knowledge, and the result of such a conference would be not to render the Shaikh any more willing to accept the traqi terms, buo to mane Colonel iJickson and myself appear as allies ol tne Iraq Government* It is nardly necessary for me to pjoint out what an undesiraole eifeet tnis impression would have on our general position in Kuwait or on Colonel Dickson r s and ny influence with the Snaiwh in regard to txiS many matters on which, we have to approach him on benaxi of His Majesty's Government. Nor would the psychological effects of the conference stop at Kuwait. 1 5m a ' ra -' such a conference would tend to confirm the Iraq Government in their impression, which it is most important for us to eradi cate on the widest possible grounds, that the Huler ox Kurfaio is a petty Shaikh, and not - juridically - ^ independent Sovereign. 4. in the paragraph under reference of his despatch His Excellency writes: « It would be desirable therefore that tne Representatives of Eis Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf should come to the proposed conference a, .mu wxtn suggestions which, in the light ox their personal experience, could fairly be put to the Shaikh.' ^ this connection / are such asconnection. I must point out that even if I were to attend the suggested conference it would be quite impossible for me to say what proposals could ’fairly 1 be ^ut to the Shaikh by the Iraq Government. It does not seem to me that any question of fairness enters into this matter which is one of policy and expediency between the two parties concerned: the Iraq Government and the Shaikh. It is for the Shaikh to say, having regard to all the circumstances as they affect him and his State, (of which naturally he is the best judge), to what extent he is prepared to meet the Iraqi proposals, and this is not a responsibility which I can take off his shoulders. 5* I quite realise that the considerations which I have put forward above would naturally not have occurred to His Excellency► Such considerations would only have been apparent from my point of view, and if I have stressed them somewhat it is merely with a view to explaining as clearly as possible; how undesirable a conference on the proposed, lines would be as far as I am concerned• Should the Iraqi ofxicials Qt; eliminated from the conference it is hardly necessary ...oi me to say that I shall be only too pleased to visit Bagdau, in company with Colonel Dickson, for a conversation with His Excellency at any time convenient to tin• 6. Witt regard to course (b) in paragraph 10, am para- gra h 12, of Sir Francis Humphrys ’ despatch, to the general effect that His Majesty's Government might consider the possibility of intervening and bringing pressure to on the Shaikh in his own interests. Personalxy I e... c- that the days are definitely past when we can regard the Shaikhs of the Arab Coast, at any rate the more important of them, as if they were minors to be made to ao t.^s or flicif , /“5- | that, against their will, for their own good. The Shaikhs of the Persian Gulx, like all other Oriental Rulers, have now grown up, and where their own interests only are concerned our action should be limi ted to g iyijig them friend^ advice. Where, however, important interests of His Majesty's Government are at stake ? then from the point of view or practical politics there is no need for us to refrain from exercising such pressure as is possible. In the present instance it does not appeal' to me S'-* 'y that such interests arise, am the Shaikh - from this aspect ,l&gt; 'a . . ^ /'■ ; 1 ' A 01 the case - can very well he left to look after his own l^^^^i^terests without the intervention of His Majesty’s Goverrmenv r 7 The Shaikh’s viev^s of his own interests in the present instance are categorically expressed in the enclosure (Extract from Kuwait Intelligence Summary) to His Excellency's despaicn, LI and whether he is really as indifferent to the prospect of I Iraqi Customs control, or Blockade, as he makes out, I tnium 1 his feelings on the subject - which are somewhat as follows - | are not unreasonable. Comparing Saudi Arabia vita i ra0 - | , n ^aud has himself instituted his the Shaikh feels is tnat ion oauu own blockade measures, and huS not tri^d to saddle him Shaikh - with any responsibility in the matter. The Iraqi Government on the other hand seek to make up xor cne ^eficienci.« in their customs control by high-handed and illegal acts by J which they hope to force him - the Shaikh - to do part of thexr | work for them. The measm-es which the Iraqi government Propose will, in the opinion of the Shaikh, infringe on hxs position of an independent Ruler, and damage tne tr.de ^ measures are taken witn prosperity of his town, and n these - - _ _ his consent and co-operation he will have to face a serl °^ and perhaps a dangerous wave of unpopularity from his geop 8. / Li8 s IV'Ki 0 - 6 - 8* It is tke factor indicated in tke last sentence of the preceding paragraph wkicii I suggest merits the close attention of Eis Majesty’s Government. Briefly, since British interests are not involved, if Kuwait is to suffer loss from any Customs or Blockade measures instituted by the Iraq Govern ment it is in my opinion absolutely essential that Eis Majesty * s Government should not in the eyes of either the Shaikh or his people bear any responsibility for such loss. Should however His Majesty's Government by bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh succeed in making him against^his will accept some, or all, ox the Iraqi proposals, then this is exactly the situation which will arise, we shall have to bear the ensuing odium, and it is unnecessary for me to dilate (I have already touched on this aspect of the question in paragraph 7 of my letter H o. 1046-S of 20th November 1934 to Eis Excellency Sir Francis Humphrys, copy forwarded to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and to tue Government of India under my Printed. Letter Kc.1047-3 of same date)on tne harmful and probaoly lasting effects which this w^xl nave on our prestige and influence not only in Kuwait, but in tne other Arab States. On the other hand if Kuwait suifers CD either by the Shaikh on the balance ox advantages accepting without pressure from us the Iraqi proposals, or (2) by the Shaikh refusing to accept tuese proposals, and by the Iraqi Government instituting strict customs control or Blockade, then no responsibility rests on His Majesty's Government,. Whatever feeling exists in Kuwait will be entertained, m the case o^ (1) against the Shaikh alone and tne case (2) against the Iraqi Government. 9. /-7- S* Iri pox*6.£ ) T &gt; o.pli 01 . his (iespahch His Hxcollsiicy wpijbssi 'He (the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs) hinted, however, ox preventive of-Liuials and possibly police and troops are post~ eb along uiie fronoiei , tii.ey will natnr&amp;lly worh as near as possiDj.e to the centre oi the smuggling activity, and the number of clashes is likely to increase rather than diminish. ft This f hint * appears to me somewhat in the nature of a veiled threat, but whether this be so or not personally I am inclined to think that the effect would be rather the contrary. What Huri Pasha euphemistically calls'*clashes n have been the illegal and high handed encroachments of Iraqi Customs and Police into the terri torial waters and territory of Kuwait, such encroachments being made to make up for the lack of a proper customs control. Cnee this is established under a responsible Iraqi officer, whatever may be the loss to Kuwait trade, there will be much less reason for the Iraqi Customs officials to indulge in 'clashes'. Ho such incidents occur on the Kuwaiti-Saudi frontier where Ibn Baud has established an organized and legal, however vexatious, control, and surely it is not too much to expect that the Iraqi Government should be capable of exercising the same control over their Customs officials as the Saudi Government aoes over t^eix'S. 10. The situation now is that for the last two years and more Sir Francis Eumphrys - if I may say so - has laboured incessant ly at Bagdad, and I have done my best at Kuwait in seconding his efforts, to try and bring the two parties to some sort of amicable agreement. We have failed, and though no fault of oui own* This being so, and taking all the arguments put forward above into account, I see nothing for it out to let matters come to a head. I suggest therefore that I be authorised to address the Shaikh /~8‘ ; iv c i Shaikh a letter to the following effect: ^(a) Recapitulation of proposals of Iraq Government as in 4 (a) of my letter No &gt; 1046-8 of 20th November 1934. (b) He capitulation Ox measures which it is understood / the Shaikh is willing to put into effect as in 4 (b) of my letter of 20th November. (c) That I have heard from His Excellency The Ambassador at Bagdad that these measures from the point of view of the Iraqi Government do not go nearly far enough, and that ix he - the Shaikh - is not prepared to make any advance on them the Iraq Government may be forced to put into effect certain counter-measures.L(Those summarised in paragraph 2 of Sir franc is Hump hrys 1 despatch. If I am authorised to write to the Shaikh I would be grateful for a further communication from His Excellency indicating what I can say to the Shaikh as representing exactly the intentions ox the Iraq Government). (d) That the measures threatened by the Iraq Government are all legal, and ii they are put into ±oxce His Majesty’s Government will not be able to assist t^e Shaikh. (e) That in these circumstances does the Shaikh wish tc make any advance on his present proposals or no U 11. I cannot say wkat tke Shaikh's reply will be but it is possible that faced with the threat of serious consequences from the Iraq Government he may oe prepareo. to meet tho-i half way. 12. In conclusion I should like to point out that the divergence between His Excellency’s views am mine is really not /not so wide as it appears. I am strongly opposed to tke suggested conference for reasons whick I am sure His Hxcelleney will appreciate. I do not think that it is necessary for His Majesty*s Government to bring pressure to bear on tke Shaikh in his own interests, and in Eis Majesty’s Government’s interests it seems to me that there are grave objections to any such pressure being applied. On the other hand I entirely concur with Sir Francis Humphry's in his most important proposal i.e. that the Shaikh should be warned that if he does not see his way to make an advance on his present proposals the Iraq Govern ment may put into force certain measures which will have serious consequences for him and his State, and since these measures will all be legal His Majesty’s Government will not be able to assist him.

X have recently had occasion to talM privately on this topic with the Minister for Poieign Affaire, and Mr. dlevwright, the British Inspector-ueneral of Urn austoms end hkcise depart ment. It ha® already been made clear that, rightly or wrongly, the Iraqi uovernment regard Kuwait as a base for organised smuggl ing md there is no doubt that the obduracy of the Shaikh of Kuwait in refusing to co-operate with them in any con tractive . measures for the suppression of this smuggling is tending to exasperate the Iraqi Government* They are convinced that the Shaikh is simply evading: the issue, and are now turning their minds towards &amp; programme of unilateral measures which cannot, but operate to the severe detriment of tlm trade and commerce, licit as well as illicit, of Kuwait. These measures include the total prohibition of imports from Kuwait, the strengthening of the armed forces patrolling the land frontier of Iraq, severe restrictions upon the entry Into Iraqi waters of Kuwaiti craft, and the with drawal of the valuable customs concessione at present extended to Kuwaiti commerce. In last named category are included the and under drawback privileges of export of goods from Iraq to Kuwait out of bo»d/free of customs and excise duty, and the concession® admissible to Bight honourable ;; '&gt;ir Bohn ritaon, 0.

'fhere are a nuiaber of Iraqi officials who sire advocates of extreme measures and they urge tliia course of action on the grounds not only of the finan cial loss which the Iraqi Treasury is suffering because offthe I volxm* of goods pouring into Iraq and ©scaping customs dutj, but also because of the loss of prestige caused to the Iraqi Govern- ment by their failure to put an end to the activities of the law- breaicera engaged im the contraband trades Traders in Basra and Imj&amp;f are complaining that normal trade is stagnating- because of the increasing amount of smuggled goods entering their markets* It possible to argue that both the extent of the smuggling gind the loss to the Iraqi Govenuaeiit therefrom are exaggerated* a assmoer of my staff has been given an opportunity of examining and analysing statistics prepared and collected by tlie Iraqi Customs department, in an endeavour to assess the actual loss caused to Iraq by a smuggling .fr*om ^uwalt* Timm figure©, of which the accuracy lm&amp; been checked by a inference to the published figures ©f Kuwaiti trade, show that the excess of Imports over exports into Kuwait, i*e. the value of goods consumed in, or exported (some at least Illicitly)from the Ghaikhdom was as follows in each of the last three years:- imi/m £109,047 I9m/m £ 150,210 19M/Z4 1*184,abl It will be observed that the amount is steadily Increasing* The average Import into Iraq per person annually over the past three years is of a value of £1*8. 6d* The average import into Kuwait per person annually during the past three years has been as follows s OMuaing a figure of 60,000 inhabitants of hbwaits- 1931/32 £3. 16.04. 1932/33 £3.17.04. 1983/34 £4.17. 04.Allowing tii® flgui'e per iieacl l»poi*ted into Iraq, as a reasonable aaount for local conauaption, the balance of laports available for illicit export from i.uvait into nelidibourlng territories bur- ing each of the thrm pm?® is?- iml/m £23,54? 1952/33 £64,TIO 1933/34 £99,381 i ar« so many factors which mqtiire to he tair.«m into eonsidesv ation that these figur#» ai*e only useful as a very rough pointer to the fact that there i® a substantial quantity of goods imported into Kuwait* which could be smuggled into neighbouring oouzitrios in the manner alleged by the Iraqi Customs bepartment* The majority of 'these excess imports ar® commodities on which a high Il4f.fl Piste customs duty is charged and Urn customs duty on the ?alue of the “potential contraband 11 would be a percentage of not leas than 7% of the value* On the other hand it is true to state that the potential profits from smuggling info Persia and Hejd are greater than those obtainmble from contraband running into Iraq and goods undoubtedly go illicitly to those countries also, Iraq, however, offers the easier and rider target and a greater prospect of success* During 1933 the Iraqi Customs detected 518 cases of smuggling, by land and sea, of goods which they believe to have emanated from the tom of Kuwait* The value of these goods was approximately £11,600 and the duty thereon was £8,500* curing the first half of 1934, 523 similar cases were detected,the goods seiaed being of a value of £7,500, on which the customs duty pay able would have been £6,000. It is, of course, impossible to say with any accuracy what the actual loss from smuggling is, but a study of the above figures, and of other detailed facts and statistics which are avail, able, render® it difficult to refute the allegations of the Oustomf /author! tlauthorities in Iraq, that (a) not loss than £S0 f 000 annually i® lost to the Iraqi Treasury and (h) the contraband business, which is undoubtedly lucrative when the cargo gets through, is on the increase. °* Th ® authorities strongly suspect that one of the reasons for the hhai&amp;h'e continued refusal to take any active steps to combat this illicit trade is that he benefits personally by a share in the handsome profits derived from it. hven if this is unt 2 *ue, he probaoly considers that the prosperity of his State is to some extent bound up with it, especially since the decline of profits derived from the pearl fisheries began to 'be Xelt by hia subjects. It is argued therefore that unless strong mia stem measures are taken by Iraq, smuggling will continue rife ami unchecked at the source. The advocates of the policy of marnmrnm economic blockade have not yet had their way because the cooler headed Iraqi statesmen are reluctant to do anything to embarrass, or to raise difficulties vis-k-via His Majesty 9 a dovemment* The continued delay in reaching' any sort of agree— s&amp;ent with the Shaikh is, however, making it more and more difficult and unless something quite definite is done quickly, 1 fear that the advocates of a strict blockade will shortly gain their point ?# In paragraph 5 of your despatch under referees# the view is expressed that it is for the Iraqi Oevemment to take the initiative in the matter of suggesting measures of co-operation In which the Shaikh might join. I would point out, however, that * the Iraqi aovemmont have already placed two separate sets of proposals before the .Jhalkh for his consideration.

It would appear, therefore, that, once again a deadlock has been reached and, in my view, it will only be removed by one of two coursesj~ (a) el thereby the Iraqi Ocvemsaait taking matter® into their own hand® and instituting rigorous action such mb 1 have outlined in paragraph B above, or (b) by His Majeaty*® Government actively intervening anti bringing pressure to bear upon the Shaikh, in his own inter ests* d® regard® course (a), 1 hate the honour to transmit herewith copy of a letter from El® Excellency Hurl Pasha, from which it will be clear to yon that the Iraqi Government desire no thing better than a. working agreement with the Shaikh* They do not wish to proceed to extreme measure®* Hi® Excellency left me in no doubt, however, during a conversation which I held with him on heather 11th, that the Iraqi Government would not tolerate the present position indefinitely, and that, failing a satisfactory agreement with Hie Shaikh, they would be obliged, as a first step, to establish such a strong: line of preventive customs post® along the frontier m to make smuggling virtually impossible* I&amp;* This may ultimately prove to be the only solution of tl difficulty should the Shaikh persist in his present attitude* I deed, judging; from the enclosed extract from Kuwait IntelligentSuaMry for the first half of Hoveaber, it aa&lt;/ dedu&lt;Je(1 that t,iie i haiidi himself would welcome such a step by the Iraqi Govern- H© would t however, do well to tawe further thought. Gives the length and nature of the frontier to be protected, the con- structIttn and maintenamo© of an adequate line of custom© posts would be costly and difficult. Once established, the Iraqi Government could be relied upon to $©© that they got full value for their money, and I cannot but feel that it would be the first step towards the more drastic measures outlined in paragraph 2 ©t seq above ending In the complete blockade of Kuwait. These apprehension© are shared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who informed m© frankly that he deeply deplored the frequent ocaasions during the last two year© on which his Majesty*© Msabassy felt impelled to protest against the growing number of alleged incidents, the truth of which it ms impossible, in present circumstances, to ascertain. h© hinted, however, (and 1 cannot but feel that he i© right., , that if large numbers of preventive officials and possibly police and troops are posted along tlie frontier, they will naturally work as near as possible to the centre of the siaeggl ing activity, anti the number of clashes is likely to increase rather than diminish. In all the circumstances, therefor©, I am loth to encourage the Iraqi mover meat to taka the contemplated step unless and until It is clear* that no other course is feasible, and until course (b) has received consideration. 3-3* As regards this course, the Minister for foreign Affairs appealed to me to try and persuade my wovemmeni, as the Protector of Kuwait, to arrive at an understanding with the Iraqi Govemaeat as to what sort of arrange meat could reasonably and fairly be put to the Shaikh and then to make it clear that unless he accepted he would forfeit the sympathy of his Majesty*a Government and coiild look for no support fro® them in this particular* matter. Given the present conciliatory attitude of the Iraqi Government, I feel that this appeal merits serious consideration. /14Y w tl S-i-i- j %%f ' 00 m * mmm mmmm -mm «% „ m f q$ X £ &amp;&amp; © &amp; t **^ ^ u'WtC i ~*.$S.&amp;0 K ■' . ‘ .4. •- HWi- ix mm 1# -* ^r 0 o*, v Sr #o-i ct? ? o &gt;v Y.lj »5&gt;^' .Jiiro p 1 , /s. twi«v ilirt Jo* xofw 4«W •**• 04 ttoqsf U£&gt;1 - ja-iil srf btoo» H fl#rf 4oa « s ' 1 ■;&lt; ... •st r - -a/J ifl ;y' - ^ 5# ft* wm .. # o-xO^l-•.*«•• ^'*nx5. fe:&gt;al:I ''ii' ; X1&gt; 9JTi^ li.

To use his words as near as possible:~ M Bin Baud was manly and open enough to himself get on with the job of trying to blockade Kuwait and keep her gqods out of Hejd. He acted firmly ? sent cars, appointed good men to carry out orders, and never asked him, The Bhaikh of Kuwait, to assist in the 'killing* of his town of Kuwait* Bin Baud did his best to hurt Kuwait, of course, and he retal iated and did his best to avoid Bin Baud’s blockade measures* Neither of them complained to each other - both did their best to defeat the other, and both remained friends. Why could not Iraq act as Bin Baud was doing? She objected to Kuwait trade going into Iraq via the interior. -ell and good: but Instead of placing posts and establishing strong points on the frontier or behind it, with cars patrolling, etc., like Bin Baud did, she asked him, the Bhaikh,to assist in killing his town of Kuwait by taking action in Kuwait and against his own people. When he refused, Iraq ^squealed’* to His Majesty’s Government and begged them to assist In forcing Kuwait to do their (Iraq’s) bidding. He opined in all seriousness that Iraq’s clear ami straightforward course was to impose a land blockade against Kuwait, if she would not agree to place a string of say 3 customs posts combined with strong points along her frontier line. This was what he would like to see Bin Baud do also, but the latter had not seen eye to eye with him on this front so far.P.Z.7927/34. eS£) SECEET No. 271/522.

The Shaikh’s tergiversation has placedplaced us ell in an awkward position, v.fcich is most regrettable* 3* The isbaikh went* on to tliat Ilf It was a questiun of accomodation between himself t.nd the * Iraq Government^ i#e* that he was prepared to give away something on his side and the ♦ Iraq Ooverment were prepared to take similar action on their * e f the confereuce would be useful* This, however, in his view, was not the case. The ’Iraq proposal© were quite unacceptable to him, while his did not go far enough from the point of view of the ’Iraq Government, and he was prepared to go no further* He thought therefore that the conference would do hern rather than good* It was not much use his inviting the ’Iraqi representatives to visit him only to inform them that their proposals were quite unacceptable* 4, On these grounds the ihaikh suggested twt he should write m official letter, which would be forwarded by m to Your Excellency for communicvcion to the ’Iraq Government, on the following lines; (a) That he understood that the proposals of the ‘Iraq Government as str ted by their representatives on their visit to Kuwait, and which had been given to him - the Shaikh, by Colonel Loch, were as follows; (i) The Shaikh of Kuwait should give m under taking to prevent smuggling* (li) Practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being cerriea outt and the suggestions or the ’Iraq v»ov*rn- saent were?- (a) to arply the ’Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the ’Iraq Cusioias authorities, or (b) to retain the Kuwait tar if I in Kuwait and to place the management oi cha Kuwait Customs under ’Iraqi bustoms officials in the employ of the shaikh of Kuwait, and that there should be u lii.dtation of imports. In- 3 - In either case 9 (a) or (b), compensation would be paid to the Shaikh. (ill) If neither oi these suggestions was accept able to the Shaikli, the ' Iraq Government would be prepared to discuss any suggestions which he might wish to make for a set clement agreeable to both parties. (.lease see paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch’s Express Letter referred to above). (b) That the Shaikh was quite unable to accept proposals (i) and (ii) above, since they infringed on his sovereign rights. With regard to (iii), in view of the friendship which he had with the ’Iraq Government he was prepared to take the following measuress (1) That all concerned in Kuwait would be warned that no goods could be exported by sea without being manifesteds persons found violating this order would be punished. (2) The Nakhuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait would be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods carried by him. On the ship’s return to Kuwait this manifest would have to be produced showing an endorsement by the Customs official of the port or ports of destination, certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at that port. (/lease see Kote of conversation between Colonel fowl© and His excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, duler of Kuwait, on the 18til July 1934 at which Major Watts, iolitical «gent, Kuwait, was present, on the subject of Kpwait- ’Iraq sann^llng). 5. We can now take two coursesx A* We can insist upon holding the Shaikh to his promise of a conference, or B. W« can accept his proposal oihis letter suggested above ana xorwara xt to the f idCi Government with the remark that though the shaikh a-reed to a conference, in tne circumstances explained in his letter the iailf is so wide between the proposals o* we Shaikh and the ’Iraq Government that a ' conference would do no good. Personally I advocate B as I do not see what good in all the circumstances a conference wouxu 5 . Finally, I venture to take this opportunity of making/- 4 making soiae general remarks which have some bearing on tiiio question# T}i&lt;c attitude of the ‘Iraq Government seems to be that ix they cannot obtain the co••operation of the Shaikh ox Kuwait they cannot stop the smuggling* This does not seem to be correct. It is of course not for us to dictate to the ‘Iraq Government aa to what measures they should take to stop smuggling into their territory, but that they could t:*-ke the iollowing action seems very obvious. (a) Institute an efficient patrol of the Kuwait- 1 Iraq frontier, say, with half a ucxan cars, two of which might be provided witfc wireless and all have machine guns and armed men on board. The cost ox this measure to the 'Iraq Government, especially in view of trie large loss which they state they are put to by way of smuggling, would be very small. The present measures appear to be limited to the following, vide paragraph to? (a), (o) and (c) of the Kuwait Intelligence bummary for October x!ji34, quoted be low:- (Golonel fickson) ‘‘(a) Since the writerZ.returned from leave on x6th October 1934, he has mad# many enquiries as to the steps taken during the summer of 1934 by the 'Iraq Government to combat the smugg'ling which they sx*e never tired of accusing Kuwait of fostering. mong ot^er things the writer paid two visits to the Northern ana North- Western frontier ox the principality to find out for himself by personal enquiry what actual ly was going on. (b) (c) He again feels it his duty to record the melan choly fact tXiat apparently only 6 men under a Chaoush are expo etc a w hold the frontier line of r6G miles. xnose six men are permanently posted at Gax'wan, are imfflo^-ile as far as one can see, uud spend thei* time apparently only in examining car© that ply between Kuwait and ,-ubair* They are indeed the only visible evia- ence &amp;lona tiie whole desert frontier of the steps that are being taken by the 'Iraq Govern- ment to combat the smuggling proolem. There are. it is true, 2 old Chevrolet armed cars which act as support to the above six men, but these are stationed at .uuair some do EdJ.es from tne frontier &lt;md cannot affect the situation much.

The Iraqi reply mentioned in Hr.Ogilvie- Forbes’s saving telegram of 23rd Duly (P.Z. 4899/34) will be found at P.Z.5302/34. It was most unsatisfactory and denied that any transgression of the frontier had in fact taken place. In view of this Mr.Ogilvie-Forbes addressed a personal letter to the late Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informing him of the independent evidence on the Koweit side furnished by Mr.Chisholm of the A.P.C.C. and asking for an exhaustive re-investigation. Taufig Beg promised that further careful investigations/ 2730 1000 4.34investigations would be made, but the second Iraqi reply which has now been received (p.Z.70G4/34 flagged) is almost ss unsatisfactory as the :irsu , denying that there was any deliberate violation of the frontier and alleging that the evidence on the Koweit side is based on reports spread about by advocates of smuggling, in whi ch category it includes Mr. oLiisholm aims elf. We have also at last received a reply from the Iraqi Government on the subject of the Customs Launch incidents mentioned in the Minute at P.Z. 4123/34. This reply also consists of a complete denial of the incidents in question. We have not yet had a reply from the Iraqis regarding the Sanam shooting incident referred to at P.Z.5282/34. It will be seen that the Iraqi attitude is still as unsatisfactory as ever and in addition to this there have been indications that the Embassy at Bagdad has again become somewhat lukewarm in supporting the Sheikh’s case. In this connection please see the marked passage in Mr.Ogilvie Forbes’s saving telegram of 1st October at P.Z. 6240/34 suggesting that, in view of the Sheikh’s attitude towards the Iraqi Government on the question of smuggling and of the fact that the actual smugglers are in most cases Iraqi suojects, 'it does not seem reasonable that H.M.G. should intervene ■with the Iraqi Government every time that the Sheikh cries out that he is hurt'. We took up this aspect of the matter with the F.O. in Mr.Laithwaite’s letter o., 23rd October, P.Z. 6240/34, pointing out that the Sheikh was on very strong ground legally and internationally on unis question and that he seemed to have a legitimate grievance in respect of all the incidents of which he has complained. The same point has been made by the Resident his express letter of 5th November which has just been received (P.Z.7271/34). In reply to Mr.Laithwaite’s letter uuc .0. have intimated that .they are in general agreementDepartment with, us on this question and on 12th November they addressed a somewhat stiff despatch to Bagdad, which will be found at P.Z.7008/34, supporting our views. The general question of Koweit-Iraqi smuggling, as distinct from the incidents which have arisen in connection with it, is being dealt with on a separate file. G .E.Crombie , 29/11/34. The Iraqi attitude is very unsatisfactory, but the F.O. are fortunately sympathetic and prepared to press the Embassy. If we can bring about a further conference at Koweit between the Sheikh and representatives of the Iraq Government it may be possible to reach some working arrangement one effect of which will be to ease the tension between the two States, but the outlook is not too good.

'It does not seem reasonable that His Majesty’s Government should intervene with ’Iraqi Government every time that Shaikh cries out he is hurt in connection with this profitable smuggling. I hope this consideration may be borne in mind when next incident occurs. The Shaikh cannot have it both ways'. The ’Iraq. Government can hurt the Shaikh in two ways. (a) legal, (b) illegal. (a) would constitute legal retaliations, such as denying free access of the Shaikh s boats to the Shatt al Arab for the purposes of getting drinking water for Kuwait. I have more than once warned the Shaikh of this possibility. If the ’Iraq Government put such measures into practice, I do not see that His Majesty’s Government could do much on the Shaikh s behal (b) represents the high-handed and entirely illegal acts of shooting/shooting up the Shaikh^s boats outside ’Ira^i territorial waters, the invasion of his territory on land^Sc the brutal treatment of his tribesmen. These presumably are the means by which the ’Iraq. Government hope to bully the Shaikh into acquiescence with their own anti-smuggling proposals. With regard to these acts the Shaikh has every right to ”cry out” and it appears to me that it is the obvious duty of His Majesty’s Government to do the best thej can on his behalf. (Sgd.) T.C.

IRAQ. AND SMUGGLING FROM KUWAIT. (a) Since the writer returned from leave on 16th October 1934, he has made many enquiries as to the steps taken during the summer of 1934 by the Iraq Government to combat the smuggling which they are never tired of accusing Kuwait of fostering. Among other things the writer paid two visits to the Northern and North-Western Frontier of the principality to find out for himself by personal enquiry what actually was going on. (b ) He again feels it his duty to record the melancholy fact that apparently only 6 men under a Chaoush are expected to hold the frontier line of 150 miles. These six men are permanently posted at Safwan, are immobile as far as one can see and spend their time apparently only in examining cars that ply between Kuwait and Zuhair. They are indeed the only visible evidence along the whole desert frontier of the steps that are being taken by the Iraq Government to combat the smuggling problem. (c) There are, it is true, 2 old Chevrolet armed cars which act as support to the above six men, but these are stationed at Zubair some 30 miles from the frontier and cannot affect the situation much. One could get no evidence that these cars ever went down the Western side of the frontier as far as Rigai on the Saudi Arabian border. (d) While it is not for us in Kuwait to pass remarks as to how ones neighbours should manage their axfaiis, it is sadly clear to the writer that such poor preventive measures as/as at present exist, are hopelessly inadequate (to use a mild phrase) for dealing with the type of Iraqi smuggler,who operates in hands of 20 to 30 tough and well armed men, all prepared to fight anyone who stand in their way* (e) One cannot hut help thinking, that the Iraq Gowernment of set purpose do not wish to spend money on combatting the trouble themselves from their side of the frontier, hut prefer to hope that by shouting enough, and accusing Kuwait loudly enough of not cooperating, the bluff the Shaikh into n carrying the baby” and doing all the spending. (f) Apart from the expense question, there would appear also to be a definite tendency for preventive officers to avoid 'taking on' their own Iraqi tribesmen engaged in the smuggling.One v/onders what is behind this. (g) Surely it should not be beyond the wit of Iraq officials interested in stopping smuggling, to devise some more effective system than at present exists, consisting as one has pointed out before of a combination of Police Posts, car patrols, and friendly Bedouins working in cooperation.COPY. 6634/669/91) 90/88/34) ' 7 255 / British Emhassy, Bagdad. 15th Octoher, 1934.

Despatch No. 34 to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.(E 6544/669/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 13th November, 1934, COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of dUy ]yiy dear Gilbert, After reading your letter No. P.Z.6240/34 of the 23rd October about snuggling between Iraq and Koweit, I think that we are mainly in agreement as to the course to be pursued. Certainly for our part we see no reason to recede from our view of the Sheikhas legal position in this matter as given in Christopher ^ „ Warner * s letter No. E 3668/2079/91 of the 28th July, 1933, to you, and we are making this position clear to Bagdad. A copy of our despatch is being sent to you officially. 2* At the same time I imagine that in the Sheikh’s own interest we do not wish to insist unduly on the purely legal aspect of this question, for, while we consider that it is really for the Iraqi Government to take the initiative in suggesting an acceptable solution of/ , Laithwaite, Esq*of the smuggling dispute, it seems to us that a completely negative attitude on the Sheikh*s part can only embitter farther relations between Kov/eit and Iraq, and may even perhaps culminate in an Iraqi threat to cut off Koweit*s fresh water supply. At present we can, I think, only wait and see what answers Bagdad will return to the questions which Loch put to them in paragraph 10 (c) of his express letter of the 27th September. When, however, these answers have been received and the ground has been cleared to a certain extent for a further conference at Kov^eit, vie hope that the Sheikh will be ready to play a rather more active part than he has done hitherto • 3* In the meanwhile vie should be glad to learn provisionally your views on the proposal to appoint from India a Director of Customs at Koweit. Brima facie this suggestion seems to us to offer great advantages, but we fully realise that it would be difficult to make any definite decision with regard to it until Bagdad have explained more clearly exactly what duties, from the Iraqi/Iraqi point of view, a Director of Customs would be expected to perform and how he might contribute to a solution of the smuggling problem* Finally, I may add that we are completely in agreement with you as to the undesirability of linking the date gardens dispute with the smuggling question (though you will remember that Humphrys himself suggested this some years ago as a way out of our difficulties}* The question of the date gardens is one which we must settle direct with the Iraqis, and we certainly do not want to moke it any more complicated than it already is by connecting it up with other questions* Even as things are at present we shall need all the goodwill which we can get (and that won*t be much I fearl)* Yours everf i&amp;y '7 ,r '-* 3. f \ '&gt; Mo, 780.

After discussion with him I venture to make the following comments. 2. We quite agree that It is unfortunate that any hitch arose over the visit of the Iraqi intermediaries to Koweit and it looks as though hrough some error —on whoso -part is- not clear - there had been failure to ' Sum l Y SENT BY AIR MAIL ,2 6 ACT 19^ A X dJ /^v^CL ^Vd-vV • Gfabr 1 '-la Ill WEEKLY LETTER 3 25 OCT 1934 tORETARY, POUViCAL AND itT DEPT. INDIA OFFICE ? 800 5000 5.34 give the Sheikh notice sufficiently far aheadv^On the other hand, as Ggilvie- Forbes says, there seems reason to ^ believe that the meeting has none some good, and from para.7 of Loch*s express letter, C.293, of 27th September (copy sent to you on 5th October unuer our printed letter P.2.6133/34) it appears that the Sheikh, as a result of the visJIJ is prepared to accept either an informal or an official discussion of the question. j 3 . we feel at the same time that it is important to emphasize as regards para.2 of Ogilvie-Fortes* telegram that the Sheikh is on very strong ground legally and Internationally in this v ii ithis question. As the Foreign Office have previously infonneh us^the onus of suppressing smuggling cannot he regarded as resting upon him, and is essentially a matter for the Iraq Govt. The incidents of which he has complained are all incidents, so far as can he judged, in which equally he has a genuine cause of complaint, and so long as he has a legitimate grievance it is */&lt; our duty (as I think: has been accepted by all the interested Departments in the discussions that have taken place) to defend his interests with Iraq. It would he impossihle, for instance, to justify the shooting by Iraqi officials in Koweit territory of Koweitis merely on the ground that the reception given by the sheikh to the delegates to the recent informal conference had been rather cool. 4. On a second point we are strongly averse (as I think the F.O. have been in the past) from linking in any way the question of the date gardens with that of smuggling. They are quite separate issues and can only satisfactorily in our view be dealt with independently, though, as Qgilvie- Forbes says, if it were possible to settle both in the near future this would be all to the good. 5.

Present Prime Minister of Iraq has often reiterated his desire for more friendly relations. By sending carefully selected delegates to this informal oonference, one of whom T was known to be persona grata to the Sheikh, Iraqi Government have made a practical gesture of friendship towards settlement of smuggling problem. It is well known that Sheikh and his subjects have for many years made great profits out of contraoand trailico In- view of his present attitude towards Iraqi Government and of f.qet, that qr.t/nql srmiomlers in most if not all cases are iiaqi ment should intervene with Iraqi Government every time that Sheikh cries out he is hurt in connexion with this profitable smuggling. I hope this consideration may be borne in mind when next incident occurs 0 The Sheikh cannot have ic hoth ways. I, neverttieless, feel that, despite outwardly barren results, this meeting has done good, tnanks to the effoi Colonel Loch and torthe adird^fed good-will of the Iraqi delegates. I have dlequ^sed this matter, both with the Minister andfyj * and Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs. Nuri Pasha is in faYonr of continuing the negotiations and at the same time proposes to strengthen the police posts at Safwan and Zu!i/bar and to exercise stricter control in Basra, where the smuggling is organised^ ihe Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs advocates a 'gentlemans agreement' with the Sheikh providing for no smuggling on the present organised scale in return for some monetary compensation. He is certain that it is within the Sheikh T s power to stop the smuggling. Here Colonel Loch's suggestion for the appointment of a British Indian Customs Controller, who would of course be in close liaison with the Iraqi Customs, seems an excellent idea. The British Director of the Iraqi Customs informs me that as Iraq loses at least £50,000 a year from Kuwaiti smuggling, Iraqi Government can afford to pay the Sheikh handsome compensation for stopping it* Ine idea of including settlement of Date Gardens case in an Iraq-Kus/aiti settlement on smuggling seems worthy of encouragement, as the more His Majesty's Government is out of hat picture the better 0 While Secretary-General seemed favourable, I doubt whether the Iraqi Government vould play up without involving His Majesty's Government, but the Date Gardens problem might well be settled about the same time as the smuggling and benefit by the existing atmosphere of good will 0 Addressed Foreign Office No#55 Saving; repeated to Bushire ho,5 Saving; copies to Kuwait and Government of India?.CONFIDENTIAL.

You will have seen from my telegram Ho.25 of to-day that the ’Iraqis have decided not to send a Customs official and that the party will therefore consist of two persons only, namely: (1) Dr. Haji Beg al Asil, Director General of Foreign Affairs. (2) Tahsin Beg Ali, Mutasarrif of Basra. The former, whom we have consulted, says thatneither takes precedence and that they wish to be regarded as equal members of an informal and friendly delegation. 2. The following history of Dr. Haji Beg is taken from our n Personalities” report for last year. ’’Bagdadi, born 1893. First became prominent in 1922 as ”semi official Hashimite representative in London. Continued r, to represent Hashimite interests in London until final conquest ”of the Hejaa by Ibn Saud. Dr* Haji then became destitute ’in England, and was deported to ’Iraq in October 1925. In ” * Iraq he was soon employed under the Ministry of Defence in ’’the ’Iraq Medical Service. Appointed ’Iraqi Consul-General ’’and Charge d*Affaires in Jedda in August 1931. Returned to ’’Baghdad in June 1932 to be present during the visit of the ’’Amir Feisal, son of King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud. Appointed ’’Consul, Mohammerah, October 1932. Acting Director-tieneral ”in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs April 1933”. Despite his unfortunate experience in the United Kiggdom, Dr. Haji has never shown any signs of being’ anti-British, and has, on the contrary, been on particularly good terms with this/ Lieut.-Colonel G. Loch,I.A., at Kuwait.this ilmhassy throughout his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. Tahsin Beg Ali was one of King Faisal 1 s officers in the War and has since held the post of Mutasarrif in various districts in ’Iraq with varying success. He went to Basra in November, 1933, and has been doing well. In particular, he has shown every desire to be on friendly terms with out Consul there . He went to Kuwait earlier this year, and Dickson reported favourably on him and on the impression made by him on the Shaikh - in this connection see Fowle’s despatch Fo.C/182 of the 7th April, 1934 (Kuwait No .0/114 of March 29th).

In my telegram 799 September 16th I reported that the Shaikh was evidently uneasy at tills hurried development, and on my arrival at Kuwait I found him even more disturbed than I had expected. 3. Shaikh said that he had not invited the representatives from 'Iraq and was, therefore, not prepared to discuss matters with them. I emphasised the sincere desire of the 'Iraq Government (your telegra m 26 Sep tember 21st) to do everything that was possible to reach an agreement and also the fact that Director General of Foreign Affairs was bringing constructive proposals, but the sudden haste in which the representatives had been sent and the fact that no reference had been made to him beforehand had given rise to misgivings and to a feeling that he heid been ignored,/ (Signature) S. 44. ( Designation)ignored, which proved impossible to dispel. I should make it clear that the Shaikh showed the representatives personally much courtesy and hospitality, housing them in his palace, inviting them to dinner and so on* I had hoped that, when I could tell him more of the 4 constructive proposals which had been promised by the *lraq Government, I should be able to persuade the Shaikh to enter into the informal discussions. Unfortunately the proposals were not of a nature to encourage the Shaikh to do so# They were; - (i) The Shaikh of Kuwait snould give an under Taking to prevent smuggling# (ii) Practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being carided out, and the suggestions of the ’Iraq Govern ment weres- (a) to apply the ’Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the ’Iraq Customs authorities, or (b) to retain the Kuwait tariff in Kuwait and to place the management of the Kuwait Customs under ’Iraqi Customs officials in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and_fi4al..fM^d should be a limitation of imports. ( —- --- -- - J = 1—III l» lltif V In either case, (a) or (b), compensation would be paid to the Shaikh# (iii) If neither of these suggestions was acceptable to the Shaikh, the 'Iraq Government would be preoared to discuss any suggestions which ne might wish to make for a settlement agreeable to both parties. Except, therefore, that the principle oi compensation has been admitted openly, the proposals are simply for the institution of 'Iraqi control ox the Kuwait Customs * 5. I conveyed these proposals verbally to the shaikh and made further efforts to bring about a meeting*# ^ftei long talk the Shaikh said that he wished to have fuller information as to the practical measures by whien it was suggested/suggested that an officer employed in the Customs would prevent supplies reaching 'Iraqi tribes while maintaining the freedom of the market for Kuwaiti ana other tribes. He was firmly opposed to the employment of an ’Iraqi officer. Ai e also asked for fuller information about the amount of a mpensation. 6. Major Watts and I further discussed at considerable length the general question of stopping smuggling, and their proposals in particular,with Dr. Kagi al Asil and Tahsin Beg *Ali, but were unable to elicit any definite answer to the Shaikh’s enquiry about practical measures. Dr» Haji said that that was a technical matter in which he was not qualified to give an opinion, but he thought that a way could no doubt be found. I hope that it will be possible for the ’Iraq Government to amplify this point in order to help the Shaikh in considering their proposals. As a very tentative figur©&gt; 3000 dinars a year was suggested as a suitable amount for compensation, but it was explained that the compensation would not be so much a payment against actual loss of customs revenue as a kind ox payment x or good will. At one time it was hinted that a liquidation of the Shaikh’s Shatt al ’Arab date garden affairs might form part of the compensation, but I said at once that I had always understood that these questions were already being liquidated under the promise made by the late King. Subsequently no reference was made to this point, out this mention of the date gardens was noteworthy. 7. In the end, it was arranged that the Shaikh should have time to consider the proposals put forward to me by the representatives, and that after a short time, te days or so, the Shaikh would, through the usual channel, invite/-4- (TW; invite representatives of the ’Iraq Government to discuss matters with ixim• Ine ShaXKXi/^oId me that he was prepared to accept either an informal or an official discussion, and Dr. Naji said that any further discussion should, he thought, be official. 8. The representatives left early on the morning of the 26th September after taking farewell of the Shaikh on the previous evening. 9. Although this visit to Kuwait has not led to any immediate outward result, 1 feel that good should ensue from the fact that the Shaikh and Dr. Hayi al Asil (Tahsin Beg ’All was known to him before) have established personal relations, and that tne two representatives and Major Watts and I have had the advantage of long informal, and very friendly, discussions of the subject. 10. If I may give my personal impression for what it is worth, I should say (a) that it would be well nigh impossible for any Euler, in circumstances such as obtain in Kuwait, to impose an high tariff owing to the resentment of the population, both urban and desert, (b) that for reasons of prestige such a Euler would be unable to accept a loan of the services oi a Customs officer from a more powerful neighbour, though he might well accept an officer from elsewhere, (c) that it wold be helpful to the Shaikh in considering the proposals if the ’Iraq vjoveramenw would indicates- (i) precisely what form of control they wish to see exercised in the Kuwait Customs, (ii) whether they would accept as satisfactory to/»*V to them the exercise of that control by a Customs Officer of suitable standing from the Indian Customs, and (iii) on what basis the suggested compensation would be calculated. 11, I would add that, on hearing that a Customs Officer was to accompany the party, I arranged with the Shaikh of Bahrain to place at my disposal for a few days the services of Mr. C.C,L.de Grenier, Director of Customs, Bahrain, as I thought that consultations between Customs* experts might provide us with useful practical suggestions. The ’Iraqi Customs official did not after all accompany the re. resenta- tives, but I was able usefully to consult Mr, de Grenier on various points* 12.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 390 of the 30th December last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the agreement between Finland and Sweden, signed on ihe 29th December, relating to co-operation in the prevention of alcohol smuggling. This copy has been printed by the Finnish Government, but was communicated to me by the Swedish Legation. 2. The Swedish Charge d’Affaires drew my attention to the clause giving the smuggling preventive services of each State the same rights and duties in the territorial waters of the other State as in their own waters, which, he said, introduced a new principle in international law. I had heard, however, that a similar arrangement existed between the Danish and Norwegian services in the Kattegat, and, on enquiry at the Danish Legation, was informed that such was indeed the case, but that the practice rested on no international agreement, but was merely a private arrangement between the respective coastguard services. 3 . A point of interest is that Sweden claims 4 marine miles of territorial waters in the Gulf of Bothnia, whereas the Danish Legation state that on the west coast, at Gresund, she only claims 3 marine miles. 4. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Stockholm. I have, &amp;c. J. THYNE HENDERSON. P.S.—-It appears that the reason why Sweden has less than 4 marine miles of territorial waters at Oresund is not that she claims less, but that the sound is so narrow that there is not room for 4 miles. ^ TT J.

Fowle, to whom I showed this paper, has given me the note of which copy is enclosed. I think you will agree that the Iraqi Govt, should not be left under the impression that Fowle assented to all the conclusions set out in para. 3 of the Embassy letter. If so, could you perhaps ask the Embassy to request the Iraqi F.O. to amend the summary of conclusions by the substitution of the following passage for the opening words of para. 3 of the letter of 25th July?* Tioln Fowle considered that the Sheikh’s proposals formed at any rate a basis for negotiation, and that if the Iraqi Govt, were not satisfied with them, they should formulate counter proposals. The feeling of the other representatives was that the Sheikh’s proposals were inadequate and unacceptable for the following y Yours sincerely, reasons:' m*) ^ $- -miMr. Walton, With reference to the informal Conference at the Baghdad Embassy on the 19th July, at which I was present on nay way home. As the Conference was an informal one, I had no idea that a report of the proceedings would be given to the Iraqi Government. 2. I do not think that the Baghdad record of the Conference differs much from that given to the India Office by me on my arrival in London. (I have noted the discrepancy in (2) below) . The main facts which are noted in both records are: (1) That the Sheik’s proposals only covered smuggling by sea . (2) That even so far as they covered the sea, these proposals in themselves were not acceptable to the Iraqi Government , (not to me as stated in the Embassy record)• These proposals not being acceptable to the Iraqi Government, it is up to the latter to put forward counter proposals coveiing smuggling by sea. (3) Smuggling by sea . But the Iraqi Government officials, since the proportion ox smuggling by sea is/is very small in comparison to that carried out by land, refused to consider smuggling by sea as a -separate step towards the solution of the general question, and wished to link this up with the smuggling by land . Yfhat they are aiming at is an Iraqi-Kuweit unified administration, which, while doubtless excellent from their point of view, has grave objections from ours and the Sheik's. (4) That a trustworthy Iraqi official, not necessarily connected with theCustoms Department, should be sent by the Iraqi Government to have a heart to heart and informal talk with the Sheikh of Kuweit. — c cXReference to previous correspondence: 1.

The Bagdad telegram should be read with Colonel Fowlers own note of the discussion on P.Z. 4986/34. It will be seen that it suggests that the Resident agreed that the Shaikh’s proposals for tightening up the manifest system were inadequate and unacceptable and that no real progress could be made so long as the Shaikh refused to deal seriously with the Iraq proposal for some form of joint customs control.

As regards the desirability of a customs union^it is accepted policy to do nothing which will identify Koweit with Iraq or facilitate the absorption of Koweit by that country or the establishment of a dominating Iraqi influence in it.

It might conceivably be possible to find some form of customs understanding which would fully safeguard the independence of Koweit, though prima facie the prospect is not perhaps very good. . On a further point it may be remarked that if there is to be any question of customs unionf the matter will be one which must be handled not by the Shaikh but by H.M.G.

On July 19th Colonel Fowle spent a few hours in Bagdad en route for the United Kingdom. He hrougtt with him tentative proposals which the Shaikh had. at last bedn induced to make with the object of restricting smuggling by sea , and these were discussed at an informal conference at the Embassy, at which were present Colonel Fowle, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, Mr, Hogg and Mr. Sievwright, oesides myself and First Secretary. The Shaikh's proposals are:- (1) A warning to be issued in Kuwait chat no goods may be exported by sea without being manifesteo: persons tl found violating this order to he punished, (2) The nakuda of every 'boat sailing from Kuwait to be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods canxed by him. On return to Kuwait this manifest to be produced showing an endorsement to be made by the Customs at the port or ports ’of destination certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at the port or ports specified. The,o o e ©2, The general upshot of discussion in which Colonel Fowle concurred, was that these proposals were inadequate and unacceptable for the following reasons:- (1) As smuggling by sea is but a small proportion of the total smuggling that goes on, the proposals only touch the fringe of the problem 0 No proposals can be regarded as satisfactory unless they make provision for dealing with smuggling by land as well as by sea, (2) In the absence of adequate supervision, the proposals are quite unworkable. For instance, there is nothing to prevent goods other than those manifested, being placed on board, or two sets of manifests being obtained by the nakuda to be used as convenient to him. (3) No real progress will be made so long as the Shaikh refuses to deal seriously with the Iraqi proposals of 1932. These proposals were, and still are for some form of joint customs control (with adequate safeguards to ensure the Shaikh against pecuniary loss) similar to certain agreements at present in force amongst the Baltic States, The Iraqi Government regard this as the ideal solution but they recognise that it is a matter for formal conference between properly accredited representatives, and not one for informal talks between officials with no executive power. The Shaikh is naturally suspicious of anything even remotely resembling a customs union with Iraq and will probably not consent to nominate representatives to confer,...,mmmi ft 3. cOiiici wit/ii the Iiaqi G-ov g riinio x\% unless lio Cciu bo assured.!- (a) of the correctness of the Iraqi motives and (b) that his sovereignty would be in no way impaired. Ig was finally agreed that, as regards (a) it would be well to endeavour to induce the Iraqi Government to sene to Kuwait two highly placed and well-disposed Iraqis (not Customs or Police officials) to confer with the Shaikh and to try and persuade him that, in spite of recent events, U he has nothing to fear, and nothing to lose, by entering into a friendly conference with the Iraqi Government. The names of the present Mutasarrif at Basra and the Director- General of Foreign Affairs were proposed, end I will approach the Minister of Foreign Affairs on these lines. As regards (b) it would be of great assistance to me if you could furnish me with information as to the working of the agreements between certain Baltic States mentioned above and possibly Belgium and Luxemburg. Discussion was conducted in a frank and friendly spirit, and the serious view taken by His Majesty’s Govern ment of the present position was made clear so as to ensure that regrettable frontier incidents should cease. I had invited the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be present but as he was already degomme and the hour was very late, I saw no useful purpose in pressing him to attend.

He explained that the Iraqis had taken the trouble to prepare for a conference here to settle the whDle business and that at the last moment the Shaikh had '’ratted’* 5 in the circumstances the Iraqis do not fe^l like waiting upon him when it suits his convenience. Whilst I consider it regrettable that nothing can be done on these lines to improve relations between Kuwait and Iraq* I cannot hel; sympathising to a certain extent with the attitude of the Iraqis.

SEEN LITICAL COMMITTEES* ' 9 RUG 1934 Please see previous submission on P.Z.2714/34 below. As the result of the instructions approved on that paper that an informal conference, to be attended by Colonel Powle, shoula be held at Baghdad, the Resident took the opportunity to aiscuss the situation generally en ro ute with the sheikh of Koweit. 2. The sheikh of Koweit, as will be seen from the note of the conversation with him papers :— (flag P), put forward proposals which appear to be satisfactory for tightening up control by sea.. Prom the note of the discussion at Baghdad it will be seen, however, that the Buropean customs officials in the service of the Iraq Government (whom Col. Fowle describes as being more Iraqi than the 273 0 1000 4.34f! - Iraqis themselves) were inclinea to aciopu a rather obstructive attitude ana to suggest that no arrangement would he satisfactory which aid not.provide lor a unified Iraqi-Koweiti customs administration. As the Resident points out, there are odj actions to this on general political grounds, for we are anxious to keep Kuweit out of the Iraqi orbiu. Apart from this, I understand from him (though this is not recorded in nis note) that the Iraq Government are anxious so far as possible to place the burden of preventing smuggling by land on the Koweit authorities. According to the Resident, the position of the Iraq Government in the frontier area lis extremely delicate, ana while a regular patrol oy a coupled of armoured cars would probably effectively put an ena to smuggling, they are apprehensive of the political difficulties with which they- would be faced (possibly a general rising by the tribesmen) if Iraqi smugglers (and the snuggling appears to be almost entirely in Iraqi hands) were shot down by an Iraqi preventive service. Their position would be much more satisfactory if responsibility for effective action rested with the sheikh of Koweit. While this may be the case, the Foreign Office nave advised us that no international obligations lie on Koweit to prevent smuggling across her land frontier ana that the responsibility (within, of course, reasonable limits) rests with the state into which the smuggling takes place. For the moment we must wait and see the result of the informal discussions which are being arranged with the sheikh. In the light of the result of those discussions we can consider what line to take with the Iraq Government. iii It Jit' ItrP, Z. 4986/34. Confidential . NOTE Lieutenant Colonel T.C.W* Fowle, QBE. on Iraq i-Kuwaiti Shiull 1 ing 0 &gt; On the I9th July, as arranged,v^hen I flew through Baghdad, I was present at an informal conference at the Embassy, with Mr. Ogilvie Forbes in the Chair. There were also present Mr. Bateman of the Embassy, 3ir Kinahan Cornwallis, Mr* Hogg, and Mr. sievwright. I put the Sheikh*s proposals before the meeting; a copy of these I have given to the India Office. /Copy sent to Foreign Office under p.Z.4891/34 on 25th July/ r ^ [ie representative of the Iraqi Customs Department, Mr. Sievwright, however, practically declined to consider these proposals. What the Iraqi Government wanted, so he saia, was a unified Iraqi- Kuwaiti customs administration, the Iraqi Government being willing to guarantee the sheikh a certain sum ao — Ui o customs revenue. After a good deal of discussion it ms finally decided, rather against Mr. sievwright’s opinion, since the last thing that he apparently wants is any friendly and informal arrangement between Iraq and Kuwait, that the Iraqi Government should send some trustworthy Iraqi official, not necessarily connected with the Customs Department, to Kuwait to have an informal and heart-to-heart talk with the sheikh. It was hoped that something concrete might result from this conversation. 2. The Iraqi proposal. for a unified customs administration is more or less new, though some of their previous suggestions have rather tended in this direction./2 direction. I dare say it would solve the problem from the Iruqi point of view, hut from the point of view of H.M.G. and the sheikh it should he looked upon with considerable suspicion, as from our point of view it would he extremely undesirable for the Iraqi Government to get any real administrative control in Kuwait. 3 . Ihe Sheikh's proposals undoubtedly represent a genuine offer to assist in stopping the smuggling by sea, and if these proposals ao not go far enough it is up to the Iraqi customs autnorities to make further suggestions. However, as has been stated above, tne Iraqi Government have practically refused to discuss measures on the sea, but wish to put into force some scheme which will include both sea anu land. I- pointed out to Mr* Sievwright at the meeting that it would be easier to move a step at a time and first fix up anti- smuggling measures by sea. However, my arguments were of little avail. He pointed out, which is true, that I the amount of smuggling by sea was very small in comparison to that carried out on the land. 4 . on the other hand, from H*MeG*'s point oi view, the sea is really the important sphere, as until the recent incursions of the Iraqi police, all Hie smuggling incidents which have occurred, the shooting up of Kuwaitis by Iraqi customs officials, have happened on the sea, and if sea smuggling was stopped these incidents would, of course, cease also. - 5 . I think the only thing to do now is to mark time for the present and wait for the result oi the informal conversation between the Iraqi official mentioned above and the sheikh.

He had no objection and his proposals are as follows: (1) That all concerned in Kuwait would be warned that no goods could be exported by sea without being manifested: persons found violating this order would be punished. (2) The Nakhuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait would be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods carried by him.

Bo xar as it took place by land it was again carried on by Iraqis ana by migratory tribesmen. Kr.

Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to correspondence ending with India Office printed letter P. Z.4123/34, of 23rd June 1934, end osing a copy of a despatch dated 6th June from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to connected correspondence on the subject of the incursion of IraqLi armed cars into Koweit territory, and to say that Sir Samuel Hoare is much concerned at the situation revealed by this correspondence. He observes that, in spite of the representations made to the Iraq, Government on 19th May by His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad, several cases of incursions by Iraqi armed cars into Koweit territory appear to have occurred since that date. In view of the seriousness of the position and the desirability of putting an immediate stop to these violations of the Koweit frontier, I am to suggest that His Majesty’s Representative, Bagdad should be asked to report at once by telegraph what further action has been taken by him since the British Embassy’s note of 19th May to the Iraq Ministry for Foreign Affairs and whether a reply has yet been received from the Iraq Government to his representations. 2. Sir Samuel Hoare would also suggest for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Ambassador should be instructed to invite the Iraq Government to furnish an explanation of | T the/ Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S. Yf. 1.0s 2 * 33^ the circumstances in which these incursions into Koweit territory have taken place, as suggested by Colonel Dickson in paragraph 7 of his letter of 24th May to the Political Resident (copy enclosed with Political Resident’s printed despatch No.484-S of 29th May). It appears from the correspondence that an Iraqi officer named Saleh-bin-Safwa has been in command of the Iraq_i armed cars concerned in the incidents which have taken place. 3. In conclusion I am to invite attention to the two further cases of violation of Koweit territorial waters by an Iraq.1 armed customs launch, reported in the Political Agent’s letter of 18th May, a copy of which was enclosed in the Political Resident’s Express Letter, No.478-S, of 28th May. As pointed, out by Colonel Dickson in paragraph 2 of his letter of 18th May, this is not the first occasion on which cases of the kind have been r eported. Sir Samuel Hoare would be grateful to be informed whether representations have also been made by Sir Francis Humphrys in regard to these incidents and, if so, with what result.

Copy of to L FQ | -f C FOB USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY. Minute.A ‘ Minute Paper. 33 h- political Department. The question of smuggling between Koweit cinci Iraq has been the subject of considerable discussion. A precis giving the more important recent developments is flagged. 2 * 11 wil1 seen that the question is oi some ' little standing; that the smuggling which takes place appears to be principally by sea and by Iraqis, the goods being bought in Koweit; but that in so far as smuggling takes place by land on any scale, it is equally bj migrant Iraqi tribes. There are varying estimates of its financial importance, but a suggestioj made by the Iraq Government on one occasion that their loss was as muchjas £60,000 a year was countered by a statement from the Gulf that the total imports of Koweit were £180,000 only in the year in question. There is , however, no question that the matter is one of substantial importance to Iraq ana that the Iraq Government are most anxious to secure a settlement of it. 3. The Foreign Office are advised that there is no international obligation upon Koweit to take active steps to prevent persons smuggling goods from Koweit territory into that of her neighbours (para.8 Precis) and it is reasonable in these circumstances that any special expenditure involved in preventive measures should be met by Iraq. On the other hand, a satisfactory settlement is desirable on general groundq more particularly as Iraq is in a position to bring strong pressure to bear on Koweit over the supply of fresh water, and it is desirable therefore to‘do what we can to lead the Sheikh to reach u friendly understanding. ^ Ml sm\ B£i eve i 4 # it is on the other hand equally desirable to make no unjustifiable concession to Iraq. Tbe Iraqis have themselves contributed not a little to the delay in reaching a settlement by their rather unnecessarily uncompromising attitude about the discussion of the various incidents which have taken place owing to firing by Iraqis on Koweit dhows and their activities in Koweit territorial waters, mu! the Embassy have given a support so whole-hearted to the Iraqi case that it has aroused doubts in the mindi of the Foreign Office. 5. The difficulties have principally arisen in the most recent stage owing to the Sheikh*s reluctance to allow himself to be represented at a conference by his Director of Customs, who is an Arab of no very high standing, even though supported by th^ Resident and/or the Political Agent. The Resident, on the other hand, has been very emphatic that it would be inconsistent with our fapaae policy to allow the Political Agent or the Resident (as the Sheikh would himself desire) to represent Koweit. The Resident's interpretation of the fapade policy is, I r think, incorrect, and the Foreign Office agree as to K this. C. The question is a small but troublesome one with possibilities of real friction, and it seems important to get it out of the way as soon as we can ^more particularly as, if the Assyrian situation goes badly - as the Foreign Office think it may - we might find it much more difficult than at the moment to' exercise friendly pressure on the Iraq Government/ The position was examined as a whole at an informal meeting at the Foreign Office on 8th June, when it we should C*(. ** nr\(j ^ AJ ^ L (Minute Paper.

The Resident has also, in the private and personal letter of 13th June of which an extract is placed on the file, again repeated his view that we ought to keep out of the present dispute. After discussion with Mr* Walton I have shown the extract to the Foreign Office, who agree that it does not affect their view and who are, I understand, prepared to concur in the revised draft telegram to Bushire, ^ with a minor addition which has been suggested to ! them at the end of paragraph 1 to prevent the Resident from feeling that we are brushing his point of view aside too lightly* The Foreign office have 2119 5000 8/33 also/also prepared tde draft to Baghdad now attached, i which would issue simultaneously with our telegram.

A separate submission has been made in regard to the recent incursions of Iraqi armoured cars to Koweit, with a suggestion that the Foreign Office should instruct H.M Charge d'Affaires at Baghdad to enter a vigorous protest. 2. The question has been greatly delayed in the Foreign Office owing to pressure of work in the Eastern Department and it is very desirable that the telegrams should issue as soon as possible.Draft Paper.

I hope H.M.G. will continue to confine themselves to ’good offices’ as I have suggested and not assume any more responsibilities in that area than they already are burdened with.

I had to come up to Quetta from East Persia where something was happening and Johnstone asked lor my opinion as to what action should be taken, Being several years younger than I am now I suggested a policy of intervention. Whereupon Johnstone remarked 'p^y dear Fowle, when there are two parties quarrelling H.M.G. often seem to have an irresistible desire to rush in and present their posterior to be kicked by both sides.

Anyhow I send them now.34 BMmm On representations teing made in the spring of 1^32 by the High Commissioner against the imposition by the Iraq Govt, of a stricter control on Koweiti water boats, the Iraq Govt, replied that a stricter inspection had been necessitated by “the smuggling which is talcing place on a large scale from Koweit to Iraq*. ’‘Smuggling is now being practised by all boats, including water boats, in which smuggled goods have actually been confiscated...The smuggling in question is not a new thing as it has been engaging the attention of the Customs Dept, since 1924. Arrangements made recently.*.have to a certain extent reduced smuggling by land which has lead the smugglers to concentrate all their efforts on sea smuggling'. 2. On the 8th March 1933 Colonel Dickson stated that in his view very little smuggling indeed took place on the land siae; that which did was confined almost entirely to Iraq shepherd tribes and e ven it was hardly smuggling proper. By sea the traffic appeared to be carried on mostly by Iraq nationals who visited Koweit in small sailing vessels, made their purphases, and returned home. The suggestion that smuggled goods to the value of £60,000 found their way from Koweit into Iraq in 1932 was in his view unfounded. (The total ¥total imports of Koweit were £180,000 for that year). Comparing the very high prices that ruled in Nejd and. c^isim with those in Iraq there was little or no financial Inducement for the contraband runners to work their traffic across the Iraq border. The big advantage was now, as in the past, smuggling across the southern borcier, 3. On 31st torch 1933 the Iraq Govt, asked through the Ambassador that the Sheikh should cooperate in preventive measures to combat smuggling from Koweit to Iraq. The positive suggestions made were as follows;- (a) No goods to be shipped from Koweit to Iraq without a permit for each shipment, to be authenticated by an Iraqi customs official in Koweit, who should send copies of the permit and of the shipping documents to the Customs Collectorate at Basra informing them of the quantity of the goods shipped from Koweit to Iraq so that they may require the importers to produce this quantity. (b) The British P.A. Koweit might carry out the duties proposed for the Iraqi official mentioned in (a). (c) A small steamboat to be placed at the mouth of the Shat t-al-Arab to watch the movements of boats. (d) Adequate control to be introduced on land.3. 4* The Sheikh strongly resented the suggestion that smuggling had taken place and pointed out that in any case the responsibility for checking it rested on Iraq, and that full precautions already existed for prevention of possible smuggling: H Not a single steamship or sailing vessel can export anything from the port of Koweit without being in possession of properly documented manifests issued by our customs authorities”. Instructions had, however, been given to the Koweiti officials to exercise closer supervision. Gasee-ef The cost of maintaining a preventive launch would be prohibitive, but would be considered. Finally, Nejd as well as Koweit marched with Iraq, and Koweit was not the only port on the Persian Gulf 5. The Resident thought the sheikh*s attitude partly due to the non- accommodating stand taken by the Iraq Govt, in some matters which concerned him, and also to the arbitrary methods of the Iraqi customs authorities, culminating in the recent killing of two Koweiti boatmen and the wounding of two others. He suggested the possibility of a special Koweiti customs official ; did not favour the introduction of the P.A., and referred to the possibility of a payment from the Iraq Govt, to the Sheikh to meet the latter*s extra expenditure in cooperative measures against smuggling. Finally, he/34 k he recommended, a visit to Koweit hy the Director of Customs of Basra or Mr* Seihright, for an informal discussion with the Sheikh, Colonel Dickson, and perhaps the Resident. 6 . In June 1933 the Resident forwarded a report on smuggling in the Gulf hy Colonel Dickson, which suggested that smuggling was of importance principally in the case of Persia and Nejd and only in the third order in that of Iraq. Contraband in the case of Iraq was run eitner (1) by small dhow to the entrance of the 3hatt-al-Arab and the upper reaches of the Khor Abdullah; (2) by camel and donkey across the western frontier of Koweit. The trade in case (1) was in the hands principally of Iraqis, though occasionally small Koweit dhows were hired. In case (2) the tribal migrations into Koweit were principally responsible. Colonel Dickson was emphatic that the Koweit is had little to do with the actual contraband traffic and expressed the view that a general reduction in customs tariffs by Iraq and the following of Bin Baud's example by getting her tribal elements on the border to assist by offering them tnree- ■ quarters of the proceeds of any contraband they can catch or be they+i 5* means of catching, was the right solution. 7• On the 16th June the Charge d*Affaires stated that he concurred with Colonel Fovvle that an unofficial preliminary discussion on the subject between the Sheikh, the political authorities at Bush ire and Koweit, and a representative of the Iraqi customs might assist and that he had aavised the Iraq Govt, accordingly. 8. On 28th July, the Foreign Office aavised that there was no international obligation upon Koweit to take active steps to prevent persons smuggling goods from Koweit territory into that of her neighbours.. .At most the cas&amp; cannot be put higher than to say that in the circumstances it would be hardly in conformity with the attitude of a friendly state to refuse to consider any scheme of cooperation at a 11 if it were put up to her by Iraq and the scheme involved no burden on Koweit other than the loss of illicit profits, but even this, I think, is putting the case rather high.' 9, Qn 31st July the Foreign Office communicated a copy of a memorandum which had been given to Sir F. Humphrys by YasiB Pasha at the Hyde park Hotel on llth July unofficially. The memorandum stated that the smuggling position/6 . position was very serious, and while admitting that rt it cannot he said that is H.E* the Sheikh ot Koweit was a party to the malpractices described* added that “there is no doubt that his people and perhaps some of his officials find it very profitable living by what occurs...It is very necessary that an agreement should be reached to put a stop to an impossible condition of affairs, which not only loses substantial revenue to Iraq, but involved a heavy expenditure on preventive arrangements which can never be entirely effective. Some measure of control of Koweit trade and proper supervision over their customs arrangements is urgently called for. The Iraq Legation wishes to discuss what form such control could ^ take under conditions which would adequately safeguard its interests. rt 10. On 12th August, the Charge d*Affaires at Bagdad communicated a note from the Iraq Foreign Minister dated 8th August, the gist of which was that as the Sheikh had agreed only in principle to cooperate in the combating of smuggling and had expressed no views on the positive suggestions put forward by the Iraq Government, there could be no advantage in the despatch of Iraqi representatives for discussion at Koweit until the Sheikh had accepted either suggestions (a) to (d) or an alternative suggestion/8 . Sheikh any excuse to regard H.M.G. as being half-hearted in defence of his interests. He should therefore press the case as strongly as he considered justifiable with the Iraq Govt. “The Resident has been requested to consult you with a view to expediting the proposed discussion at Bagdad'. The Ambassador replied on the 13th December that he had made the necessary representations and was pressing for a conference between representatives of the Iraq Govt, and the Sheikh to discuss practical measures to ensure the observance of law on the frontier. 15. The Ambassador’s protests drew special attention to the fact that the channel in which the preceding incident was alleged to have taken place was well within Koweit territorial waters and urged that definite information as to the territorial boundaries of Koweit should be given to the customs officials concerned. 16. On 27th December the Political ed Resident forward/a report, the general effect of which was that the Iraq Govt, could, if they wished, apply serious pressure to Koweit by exercising restrictions on the movements of the Koweiti water boats. 17 . on 7th January the Iraq Ministry for Foreign Affairs gave a not veiy convincing reply to the protests in connection/connection with the incident referred to in para. • They expressed their agreement in principle with a conference 'to discuss what practical measures should he adopted to ensure order in the.. .three-mile zone from Iraq shores' and added 'Since the smuggling of foreign gooas into Iraq from Koweit is the sole cause for these incidents and as this smuggling has assumed such serious proportions as compel the Iraq Govt, to stiffen control and will result in an increased number of regrettable incidents of this nature the Iraq Govt, consider it necessary that the conference should discuss before anything else the remedying of this state of affairs and measures necessary for putting an end to this smuggling'. They suggested that the proposals already put forward by them ' 'or some other proposals calculated to put an end to smuggling and to prevent the recurrence of incidents such as those under discussion should frm the bases for the discussion of the proposed conference.' 18. On 24th January the Ambassador telegraphed to the Resident that he hoped he would receive authorisation from the Sheikh to speak and act on his behalf. Colonel Fowle replied on 25th January 'Present facade policy of H#M.G# with regard to Sheikhs of Gulf/10 . GUI! is to emphasise independence of latter vis-a-vis foreign powers and I think it undesirable that Dickson or I as British officials should appear as representatives of Sheikh of Koweit. Latter should he formally represented by his own man, but Dickson and I will do our best to pull the strings', 19, The Ambassador suggested as the Agenda for a conference: (1) Consideration of Iraq Govt.*s proposals for cooperation to prevent smuggling; (2) Boundaries of territorial waters of Koweit and Iraq; [6) Complaints against patrols of Iraqi customs vessels outside Iraq and within Koweit waters; (4) Consideration of complaints by either parties, A gentlemen* s agreement would probably suffice, but the sheikh’s representatives must be empowered to speak and act for him: 'If Sheikh is truculent will do him no good. He is perhaps even more at mercy of Iraq than Bin Baud'. 20. On 10th February the Resident reported that the $helMi, while agreeing in principle,by tightening up of manifests, to cooperate in checking contraband by sea, definitely j declined/declined to allow his representative to act as spokesman for him or carry on direct conversation with Iraqi officials at conference and asked that Colonel Dickson and the Resident should do the talking 'though he would give us no authority without previous reference to him K . Colonel Powle repeated his view that it was undesirable that he and Colonel Dickson should represent the Sheikh and recommended postponement of the conference, to which the Ambassador agreed ynder protest. 21. On 14th February the Resident telegraphed that he had had long discussions with the Sheikh, who agreed to the tightening up of manifests by sea and suggested that as the details of the scheme were technical a customs official should be detailed by the Iraq Govt, to visit Koweit and discuss them with him. Vi/hen the scheme had been thrashed out, but before he formally agreed with it, he would like to take up with the Iraq Govt, the complaints agdinst patrols of Iraqi customs vessels outside Iraq and within Koweit waters. 22. On 1st inarch the Resident reported that the Sheikh was extremely unlikely to agree to any formal conference at Bagdad for the present and suggested that a decision be deferred pending receipt Qj. certain further despatches. fi 23/12 . 23. Meanwhile (15th February) the Ambassador, in reporting on the postpone ment of the conference, urged tnat tne Koweitis were inveterate and daring smugglers, both by sea and land, and had themselves largely to blame for the blockade maintained by Ibn Baud and for the energetic preventive measures taken by the Persian and Iraq Govts. While recognising that tne P.A. Koweit disputed the effect on Iraq revenues of smuggling from Koweit, 'the control of the Iraqi customs is, however, in the hands of zealous, efficient and conscientious Englishmen, who, I am convinced, would not have taken the extreme measures against Koweiti x smuggling that have resulted from time to time in loss of life had they not been convinced as to their necessity. * He admitted that there might be faults on both sides and that owing to the uncertainty as to the limits of territorial waters it is more than probable that the zeal of the Iraqi customs authorities has at times led them to take action outside the limits within which they can properly operate*. He then discussed the 'agenda referred to above, ana referred to a suggestion that the Iraq Govt., had a meeting taken place, would have suggested the establishment of spme machinery to enable an impartial finding to be given to/— 13. to both sides, and that Colonel Ward’s services might he utilised In this connection, any reports submitted by him, after examination of the actual participants in or witnesses of incidents, being scrutinised by the British Judge at Basra before being communicated to the two governments. Finally, he urged the desirability of persuading the Sheikh to agree to be represented by responsibile British officials and added that he was under the impression that the foreign relations of the Sheikh were still conducted by representatives of H.M.G. and that a conference such as was now contemplated was eminently of the type where his representation should be undertaken by British officers. The Iraq Govt, had always wished to deal with the Sheikh 24. On 20th February the Resident wh urged on tns Aiftonssctdor o 3 g xii 1 jy of an Iraqi customs expert discussing the tightening up of manifests with the Sheikh. The Ambassador was, however, reluctant ta agree on the ground that this only touched the fringe of one of ) the questions at issue and would do nothing to alleviate the dangers of the present situation, and corresponded to a similar proposal alreauy rejected by the Iraq Govt. 25/14. &amp;5. In a private letter of 21st February the Ambassador again urged on the Resident the desirability of allowing British officers to speak on behalf of the Sheikh.. 26. On 1st March the Resident dissented from the suggestions referred to in para. ^ above; suggested that the question of the boundaries of the territorial waters of Koweit and Iraq was one on which it would be necessary to ascertain the views of H.M.G. and urged that it was desirable that if they wished to avoid Increasing their responsibilities in regard to Koweit, should refuse to accept the liability which woulu be involved in agreeing to representation of the Sheikh by the Resident or Colonel Dickson. He \ repeated his suggestion that it was important that an Iraqi customs official should visit Koweit for discussion with the Sheikh on the subject of manifests. i 27. On 22nd March the Ambassador telegraphed to the Resident that he adhered to his previous views. The Iraq Govt, would certainly refuse to wait upon the Sheikh and the proposed visit would increase the suspicion and distrust already aroused by his attitude. The Sheikh’s best course would be to submit definite proposals in writing, without delay. Meanwhile the Ambassador considered it best to leave the situation ; as/as it was. He proposed to inform tne Iraq Government triat no further arrangements for the conference would be made until they heard further from him. The Resident agreed and undertook to put the Ambassador's suggestion to tne Sheikh. 28. On 7th April the Resident repeated his suggestion for a visit.Extract from Private and Personal letter from Lt .Go 1 . i *G. (/. lowle, to Mr. Laitiiwaite, dated 13th June 1934.

Baghdad’s despatch ho,96 dated the 15th t’ehruary 19 34, ishieh I received after the despatch of my Express Letter ho. 192 -S, dated the 90th Heh.ruary 1934, I have the honour to make the following comments. 2. With regard to the first sentence of paragraph 2 of His Excellency’s letter: 'There 'can he no doubt that the Kuwaitis are inveterate and daring smugglers, both hy sea and land , and have themselves largely to blame for the blockade which ibn Baud maintains against them and for the energetic preventive measures taken by the Persian and Iraqi Governments • ^ I cannot admit -j a- the Kuwaitis themselves are to blame for Ibn Baud * s blockade, nor do 1 think that His Majesty’s Government are of this opinion. However, this as something of a side issue to the present subject. 3*/ 2 6 MAR 1324 »r* c: \ : j-y v*' i w i- l V 8As far as I^nwait-Iraq smuggling is concerned, the above quoted statement is, 1 venture to point out, not Quite correct. The actual state of affairs, which has an important hearing on the Question of smuggling, is given in nio some detail in paragraph 7 of my Express better referred to above, i.e. that while the Kuwaitis are smugglers by sea, it is the T Iraqis themselves who are smugglers by land, composed of T Iraai tribesmen who visit Kuwait and return to their own country with the smuggled goods. 4, With regard to the proposals of the ^raq Govern ment - mentioned in paragraph 3 of His Excellency’s letter. The one which concerns the tightening uo of manifests has now been accented in principle by the Shaikh, and was dealt with at the conclusion of Daragraph 7 and in paragraph 8 of my Express Letter referred to above. 5. With regard to the Agenda - mentioned in paragrs 5 of Sir Erancis Humphrys * letter. Item ia; deals with the main cause of dispute between the two countries, i.e. smuggling, and if this can be solved, or even nartially solved, the relations between the two Governments should improve, especially if Item (d; - complaints - can be settled. Item lb; - the settlement of boundaries of the territorial waters of Kuwait and T Iraq. This would- seem to be a complicated matter of some importance in which His Ktetj esty T s Government are presumably interested, ano which i venture to suppose could hardly be settled locally without their views being previously ascertained. it on l c; /3- item (c;. On the land, as far as ± know, no frontier incidents affecting Kuwaitis and Irani s have occurred: such incidents have been confined to clashes between the ’Iraqi Customs officials and, Irani smugglers. lith regard to the reasons put forward in oara- 6 graph 11 of His Excellency the Ambassador’s despatch, to the effect that a Conference such as the one on smuggling was of the type where the Shaikh’s representation should be undertaken bv British officials. My objections to either Colonel Hickson or myself or both representing the Shaikh at such a Conference are based on considerations for the interests of neither Kuwait nor ’Iran, but for those of His Majesty’s Government . The latter have already a number of commitments of varying responsibility with regard to Kuwait affairs. The Bate Gardens, concerning which they gave a definite promise to the Shaikh, is one; Ibr? J3auc’s biock ade* concerning which no actual promise was given but certain hones were held out, is another; the pro t e c 1 1 on of the whole of the Kuwait Hrincipolity - vide India Office despatch Ho.lM* 7 6R3/33, dated the 1st February 1934, to the Ho^eimn Office, is a third; while Oil interests represent a fourth. l do not imagine that His Majesty’s Govern- rnent , if they can avoid it, wish to take on their shoulders any further responsibilities with regard to Kuwait, At Present the Kuwait-’Iraq smiiggling is not such a responsihiliKr. His Majesty’s Governnentt have given4- I i already quoted). His Majesty's Go--eminent are not affected, and the Shat \h mist take the consequences of wM oh he has had smile warning. The situation there 'ore seems to he one in which FIs Kajesty's Goyernnient should restrict their efforts to -rood offices while themselves fonnally remaining in the hacktrround , 1 am strongly of opinion therefore that the Shaikh at anv conference or talk should he represented hy his own representative with Colonel ' r &gt;ickson o' i, or both, [ present for purposes of advice, as pat forward, in rnv telegram (lTo.85 of 85th Januamr 19, 17 4; quot ed hy bi r Francis Hitmphrys, If* on the contra^ Col^el Fichson and i appear actual representatives of the Shaildh then it seems inevitable that TT i- Majesty^ ao^ernment will assume some di- ect, and in rev opinion unnecessary, responsibility for the smuggling question, more especially if the conference i ^hich we appear is in ana’- way a failure. in other words fher^ is no need - if l may out it that wa^ - for His j Majesty’s Government to pick the chestnuts out of the | fire for the Shaikh, and possibly burn their fingers in | consequence. ’ 7 * 1 think it extremely unlikely that the Shaikh will, fo''' the present anyhow, agree to any conference at Baghdad, if the two parties therefore cannot be brought together at a formal conference, the only alternative is to proceed Tyr informal conversations covering f^e various Points at issue stage by stage, and J ' h e first step in this direction, tfiaich in no way commits the ? Tra fove mm ent to anyth 1 ng, is for an ’l-'aai Oust oms official to visit Kuwa^f for a discussion with the 3haiTdi\ on the latter’s offer to tighten up Ms iranifest system* 8* ^P, sunLJlII* smuggling which is prevalent from Kuwait into ’Iraq is a source of loss and annoyance to the ’Iraq Government. This smuggling talces two forms: (a) by land, the actual smugglers being ’Iraqi tribesmen who purchase their goods at Kuwait and smuggle them into ’Iraq; and (b) by sea, in which the Kuwaitis are them selves concerned as carriers. The ’Iraq Government have asked for the co-operation of the Shaikh to check smuggling. The Shaikh is within Ms le^al rights to refuse co-operation as the burden of checking smuggling rests on the country into which the smuggled goods are taken. On the other hand if the Shaikh does not co operate the ’Iraq Government have various legal methods, stopping the Kuwait water-supply being one, with which they can retaliate* The Kuwait-Iraq conference which was to have taken place recently in Baghdad did not materialise owing to the Shaikh’s refusal to give proper authorisation to his representative. The Shai kh has, however, agreed to tighten up his manifests, wM ch if carried out in a way acceptable to the ’Iraq Government should considerably lessen (if it does not altogether stop) the smuggling by sea, and it is an the sea and not on the land that regrettable incidents have taken place by the action of ’Iraqi Custerns officials shooting Kuwaiti boatmen. The next step therefore is for an ’Iraqi Customs official, as suggested by the Shaikh, to visit Kuwait for discussion with the Shaikh on the subjec* of manifests.

I have written today to Louie on the subject of the postponement of the Conference between the representatives of Iraq and Kuwait, to which reference is made in my despatch No. 96 of February 15th. Yours ever LANCELOT OLIPKAi??, E.C.M.G., C.B21st February, 1934. t A j i / Hy dear Fowls, Will you please refer to my telegram No.9 of the 17th February on the subject of the conference between representatives of Kuwait and the Iran Government. I should have preferred to wait for the receipt of the express letter promised in your telegram No.210 of the 20th February, but as the bag goes this morning I am afraid our letters will cross. 3y this bag you will receive a copy of my despatch 110.96 d^ted 15th February to the Foreign Office, which sets out the case in detail as we view it from this end. Since that despatch was written, I have received a letter from Nuri Pasha, No. 1168 dated 18th February, a copy of which I enclose. I was most disappointed that it was found necessary to postpone the conference, chiefly because I had prepared, the way by several interviews with the Iraqi ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance for a discussion which, I Giiln^-, would have led to an amicable settlement or the complaints o± both parties and a practicable modus vivendi for the mrcrre. If the conference had t aken place as arrang© 0 * t at- e every prospect of a settlement being arrived at witnin two days. Everything has now been changed by the resignation of the present Cabinet, and it is most unlikely eitrier Nuri Pasha or Nasrat al Farisi (the T.anis te± s for foreign Affairs and Finance) will be members of the new Government. . Tie oncurable ut.-Colonel T.C.N. Fowle, C.B.F., ^ ^ ^ Political Resident in the Persian Guj-i-. BUS II I R B.’■'■ r e therefore have to begin all over again in a very different atmosphere, and I fear that we shall not be able to hold the conxerence nov.- xor borne weeks until the new llinisters have settled down in the saddle, . I-oaa seems to me to have a real grievance against ^uwait in the matter of smuggling, and l do not deny that Kuwait may have well-founded complaints against the Iraqi customa authorities for the manner in which they sometimes carry out their duties. if the Shaikh is going to take up an intransigent attitude towards the Iraqi complaints about smuggling, there is little doubt that the Iraqis will attempt before long to adopt Ibn Sa’ud’s method of treatment i.e. to blockade him and, as Kuwait is dependent upon Iraq for its fresh water supply, the pressure that might be brought to bear on the Shaikh would be very severe. Hitherto, I suppose, he has relied on the good offices of His Majesty’s Government to protect him from Iraqi reprisals, but he cannot bank on the effectiveness of this assistance indefinitely, unless he shows some disposition to come to terms on a reasonable basis. especially if he is reluctant to allow British officers to me that if the facade arrangement is carried too far, the Iraq Government will try to realise their long-felt desire to deal with the Shaikh direct, which would place him much in the same position as a sheep arguing with a wolf. I know you will do your best to bring the Shaiuh to a reasonable frame of mind, and you can count on me to do anything I can to secure a fair deal for him with the Iraq Government. I am sending a copy of this letter to '.)li_. k-.. u* It will be so nice to see you here eventually. Yours ever, (3gd. ) INH. Humphrys. P.S.You will see that the agenda as finally agreed between Yuri Pasha and myself differs slightly from that which I telegraphed to you in February. phis is due to the desire of/ the Iraqi government to avoio as far as possible a barren fj argument of the particular complaint mentioned in item 3 as telegraphed to you and to include it in item 4 with a view to arrive at practical measures for dealing with all general complaints as distinct from .isolated incidents. My telegram of February 6th was sent off under a slight misapprehension. You will, I am sure, agree that the agenda as finally proposed is preferable and most likely to attain the object proposed. I ought to add that it will not now be possible to convene the conference until after March 6th owing to the absence of the Iraqi Director of Customs on a tour of inspection.'• — 0 P Y) MINISTRY I'OR FOREIGN AI'TAIRS BAGHDAD, IRA'’.

Iraqi Government consented to broaden the basis of confersQce sc that customs questions likely to lead to a fruitless wrangle should be subordinated to that of the general establishment of good relations and the preservation of law and order on me frontier and in territorial waters. Shaikh seems to have missed a golden opportunity and nis refusal to enter into frank and open discussion through duly authorised representatives with Iraqi Government is most regrettable and plays directly into the hands of those who, in Press and else where, are trying to work up a campaign against him. On the main issue of smuggling he cannot reasonably pose as the complainant and it is now for him to respond to the proposals of the Iraqi Government which were designed to secure an equitaole modus vivendi for the future.

Dear Mr• Bateman, The Director of Customs is due to leave Baghdad on February 81st on a tour of inspection, which if completed, would last till March 6th. In the absence of any indica tion of the date when the Kuwaiti delegation is likely to be ready to visit Baghdad we do not feel justified in asking him to postpone his tour. We should therefore be grateful if you would kindly bear the above dates in mind when corres ponding with the Resident in the Persian Gulf, with a view to fixing for the meeting a day which shall not fall between the dates mentioned. The Director could, if urgently required, be recalled on or after March 1st, but we should prefer not to recall him if this can be avoided.The en&lt; jt, T his?hire, th« Thth 1934. ^3&lt;ni.l&lt;?. ^roti ple«ne refer to my Hrprenfi better Ifa .

In the last paragraph of my despatch I suggested a friendly ’round table’ discussion to take nlace between a Customs representative of the ’Iraq Government, the r- ra T »m/self. ^OU approved yhdikh of Kwalt. Colonel ^ ^ „ ir) , rolir letter Ro.S5 of 16th Bine, ard of the Bti great ion in your (Designation) add res eed/ Msasi4^ ■ \ f addressed a Mote to the ’Iraq Government • ^he latter refused this ’round table’ discuBsion on the ground t h^t they considered H no useful -purpose rouM be served by a conference at Kmait until the Shaikh has agreed in principle to enforce certain measures of co-©Deration in Gustoms control, or has made concrete proposals of bis cron. rt (Vide paragraph 2 of your letter Ho.36 of 19th Aumst 1933). In view of the nature of the Shaikh’s reply, which was entirely vague, the ’Iraq Government were doubtless technically rif#vfc In refusing to Participate in the discussion, but from a practical point of view it is a pity that they took this somewhat unbend i np attitude as good mi edit have cone from a friendly discussion, and certainly no harm would have been don e. 5. fim next effort towards a solution of the smuggling question was the proposed Conference at Baghdad which has had to be Postponed under circumstances sufficiently explained in the previous comespondence. 6. I entirely agree that the '&gt;hai kh by refusing the Conference has lost a good opportunity of adjusting matters with the Iraq Government, especially as the latter were willing to discuss his complaints against the action of ’Iraq Customs vessels. But there is no need f 'or me to remind the Gft&amp;i idi again ~hat he relies on ’Iraqi good-will for his water supply. I have not failed duripr the past year when the subject of smuggling has bee n die cuss ed to impress on him: (l) fhat whatever may be the posit ion as to the Bate Gardens and Bin Baud’s Blockade the matt er of smuggling is enti rely his resoonsibility ard not I r is Majesty’s Gov rnment’s. (p) That if he does not co-operate with the ’Iraq Government/{arovernwept the latter have varlouB ways well ’within the law’, (ston^a^e of his water supply is one), hy which they can hrinp serious pressure to hear on hiTn 0 I repeated these arpumerts to him when X saw hi»? at Kuwait before sending my telegrams ’to. /40 and T/41 of 14th February. Whatever consequences result from his attitude he cannot say that he has not had ample warning, 7. At the same t ime T venture to urge that the suggestions contained in my telegram Ho,T/40 (the addition contained ( in my telegram ho,T/41 may not be practicable) be conveyed to the ’Iraq Government, '’he main question at issue between ^iwait and ’Iraq is smuggling, and if the re were no smigrling there would not - so it seems to me - be much question of the preservation of law and order or of good relations between the two Governments (vide paragraph 3 of your telegram under reference). ^his smuggling tahes place fa) by land fb) by sea. ^he proportion, of smuggling that takes place by (a) is certainly greater than by (b), but the latter is presumably not negligible. 1 or cover while on the land the actual smugglers are ’Iraqis (iSuwaii being merely the market from #i.idh the goods are purchased) on the sea the Kuwaitis are also frequently the actual carriers of goods, and it is on the sea that Hie various regrettable incidents have occurred of the shooting of Kuwaiti boatmen by ’Iraqi Customs Officials. If smuggling by sea disappeared, or even lessened* these incidents would cease, or at any rate decrease in number. Any measures therefore which would tend to check the sea smuggling waild seem to be well worth the consideration of the ’Iraq Govern ment, certainly from the point of view of His Majesty’ll Government./Governmarct. 'from the discuBsiofi uhlch 1 had with tfc « f^halkh it seews to m that the tightening up of the manifests which he suggests should appreciably check the smuggling by sea, hut it is for the ’Iraq Oov err inert to say whether the Shaikh’s proposals are in their opinion effective or not, and the most practical way for this opinion to be formed is surely for an ’Iraqi Customs expert to visit Kuwait for a die cuesicn with the 3hai)di. 8, I trust that the consider&amp;tions advanced in the preceding paragraph dispose to some extent of objections (a) and (b) in paragraph 1 of your telegram under reference? With regard to (c)• I do not think that the ’Iraqi Covem- ment have already turned down similar proposals: the Shaikh’s previous reply (paragraph 3 above) was too vague to constitute a proposal at all, and his present one miidit be said to come under the '‘concrete proposals of his own ^ referred to in your letter -Jo.36 of 19th August 1933 (para grarh 4 above)» sdo T.

I have also stressed the necessity for the Shaikh of Kuwait to empower his representatives at the conference to speak and act for him. You will remember that when we talked over this matter last week I promised that we would draw up for your consideration a draft procedure to be followed at the conference. X have now given very careful consideration to this question and, in view of the fact that the conference will only last two days, X suggest procedure on the following lines:- .FIRBg DAY. (A) I suggest a short speech of welcome by you as Chairman of the conference in which you would take the opportunity to explain the object of the conference, viz, to arrive at a written modus vivendi, embodying, of course, means of co-operation to prevent smuggling, and designed mainly to ensure the preservation henceforth of good order on the Kuwait-Iraqi frontier and more especially in territorial /waters. is Excellency Nuri Pasha A1 Said, G.C.V.O. , C.M.G. , D.3.0. , Minister for Foreign Affairs, B A G D A D.Vy GOHS’ID SM TIAL.

Sir, Jith reference to my despatch !:o.263, dated the 1 st Kov^saber 1933, and paragraphs © &amp; 11, I have the honour to report that the sailor Abdul Shah was wrongly, but rather excusably, reported by m© as having died of wounds at Basra. 2. It appears that Abdul Shah’s relatives, who are quite poor people here were told by the Fa© Police that he had died and been buried at Basra and that was the end of the story from th^ point of view. 3. Bhat actually happened was that Abdul chah hov red between life and death in the Basra hospital for 3g months, made a remarkable recovery and returned to his delighted family literally*as one from the deed* on December 20th last. He, however, had a relapse on arrival and was again confined to his bed till 10th January. 4. Abdul bhah’s wounds were (a) a rifle bullet through the right thigh high up; (b) another rifle bullet through the lower part of his back which passed through his body and out to the front completely severing on© testicle and half his penis. found (b) has maimed Abdul Chah for life. 5. His Excellency the Shaikh sent Abdul Ahah to me on 15th January thinking I might like to take his a it ence. ©♦ The man was still suffering from the effects ofante Paper. r gli it gal Department. From private correspondence with Colonel Dickson it appears that the Sheikh is apprehensive that the Koweit case may suffer unless he is ui.ectl^ represented oy the Political Resident or the Political Agent.. His Director of Customs is an Arah of no particular standing and unlikely in the Sheikh*s view to be able to stand up to pressure hy sir Francis Humphrys or oy the British officials in the service of the Iraq Government. Apart from this, he is inclined (not unnaturally) to regard sir Francis Humphrys as likely to press the case from the Iraqi side. The Sheikh's hesitations are understandable oufio. while there is much oo he said for our facade policy I am not sure that in present circumstances we might not have been justified in stretching a point and allowing the Political Agent, Koweit, with the assistance of the Sheikh’s Director of Customs, to speak on behalf of the Sheikh. The easiest solution may be the deputation of an Iraqi Customs official (e.g. Mr. seateig&amp;k.) to discuss the matter at Koweit, but we shall no doubt receive detailed recommendations from the Resident in due course.CONFIKgfTIAT,.

My dear Prime Minister, Will you please refer to 8 ir Gilbert Clayton’s Deeret letter No. P.0. 128 dated the 9th of April, 1929, on the subject of the position of the Iraq. Government in regard to the Pooka Channel,, in which he stated that His Britannic Majesty’s Government ware unable to form a definite opinion on the position until a survey of the area had been completed. The details of the survey, which, as was stated in the last paragraph of that letter, the Port Director hast been asked to carry out, have since been received and have been given careful consideration by His Britannic Majesty’s Government. The result of the survey is to show that large areas of mud flats on both the Iraq, and the Persian sides of the estuary which were formerly considered to be dry in patches only at low water, have, in fact, a definite low water line. In the opinion of His Britannic Majesty^ Government the base line for the determination of the limit of territorial waters is the line of mean low water spring tides, and the Hats thereby are to bo regarded as territory. As a result of the information furnished by the survey His Britannic Majesty's Government have reached the following two conclusions5- (1) That there is a strong ease for considering that the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab is a line joining the extreme end of the mud flats on the Iraq, and Persian shores to which I have referred above, and that the waters of the river down to the mouth may be claimed as Iraqi national waters. fhis line would take within the Shatt-al-Arab area a portion of the Hooka Channel. (S)\ \ (Sd) Hubert Young. (2) That it could reasonably bo contended that the Eooka Channel is wholly out-side the Persian terri torial waters and lies partly within Ira.i territorial waters and portly m the open sea. As, however , thape la no generally recognised principle of International Law governing the limitation of territorial waters of two riparian States at the mouth of a river, the result of a reference to arbitration on this point could not be predicted with any certainty. rt iV ^ , therefore ' raoQ t important to avoid a dispute with Persia on the point mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above, and this, in a lesser degree, is also true of the conclusion in sub-paragraph (X) above. 1 311 therefore able to advise Your Excellency that in tne opinion of His Britannic Majesty’s Governraent the estab- 1 ishment of the proposed Shatt-al-Arab Goneervancy Board and the delegation to that board of the reapjonsibility for the upkeep of the Hooka Channel would offer the best means of eliminating the risk of dispute with Persia on this very contentious subject. Details of the evidence on which the above conclusions are formed will be sent to Your .Excellency us soon as they are received from London, but in the meantime I strongly recommend that an early decision should be given on the question of the formation of the Shatt-al-Arab Conser vancy Board (to which my Confidential letter No. P.0. 870 dated the 4th of doveiiber, 1989, refers) and that the above opinion should be given full weight before the decision is reached.

My dear Prime Minister, Will you please refer to ay Secret letter No. P.o. 287 dated the 29th of November, 1989, on the subject of the “ “ - ,o .1, •is ixceliency the High Commissioner has been informed that as a result of further consideration which has been given to the point mentioned in conclusion (8) of that letter, it is considered that the position would be better explained by the substitution of the following -hat it could reasonably be contended that the whole of the Hooke Channel except a small portion of the Eastern end lies within Iraqi territorial waters. The eastern portion so Ear as it lies more than 3 miles from the Abdulla Bank must be regarded as probably being partly Persian territorial waters and partly open sea, but the is doubtful as, according to the principles of international law recognised by His lajesty’s Government, it depends on what must be deemed to be the line of the coast north of the end of Abadan bank, and sufficiently definite information is not available as to the extent to which the mud and sand flats south of Darakistan project southward. It would be reasonable that the control of the whole of the Hooka Channel should rest with the Authority responsible for the river, but there is no generally recognised principle of International Law governing the limitation of territorial waters of two riparian States at the mouth of a river, and the result of a reference to arbitration on this point could not be predicted with any certainty*.

The point is of importance as it is not only in connection with smiiyyliny, but in other matters also, that this pressure could be applied. I asked Colonel Hickson to investigate the matter and J enclose a copy of his Beport, Ho.998, dated the 16th ^eownher 1933. S. Briefly, the sittiation would appear to be as follows. Local wells exist which were sufficient for the local population in pre-war years. These wells, however, depended largely on rainfall, and owiny to the increase of population under Bhaikh Mubarak’a reiyn, in about 1908 their jpeiit supply began to prove insufficient, especially when the rainfall was poor. a er then began to be brought in boats from the -el-Arab, and there are now some 50 boats employed exclusively in this trade. Tn an emergency/emergency' the loe«X no dilation would be able to carry on with the local aupoly, hut they could perhapa only do this for a short Period. Artesian wells could probably he sunk with success which may render the local population conoletely independent of the Thatt-el-Arah water,hut this would cost money and. throw out of employment the men employer! in the water-carrrinr trade* 5 4r ^^ard the actual supply of water from the rhatt-el-Arab.

From To Lt.-Colonel H*R.P.Dickson, C.I.D., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire. The Drinking Water available in Kuwait, and to what extent the Town is dependent on Shatt- a1-Arab water. tfh I f; ft . Six*, .*ith reference to your telegram i.o.1120, dated the 11th December 1933, I have the honour to forward the follow ing documents, which I trust will provide ail the information you desire on the subject; (A) Note on the 'Prinking Watar” available in the Town and immediate vicinity of Kuwait: IB) Note on the various points on the dhatt- al-Arab estuary where 'Drinking Water' can be obtained, at different seasons of the year; (C) Rou^i sketch map of the mouth and bar of the Shatt al Arab, showing the approximate boundary of ’Iraq territorial waters, to wards the open sea. II. (i) As re^srcis (A): I have prepared this myself from notes which I collected for Amjr Headquarters, Inoia, recently the facts mentioned are from personal observation and enquiry. (ii) As regards (B): I have collected the data, ,'iven, direct from a number of Dhow (BUM) Captains, who are regular ly engaged in bringing drinking water from the Chatt al Arab it to Kuwait and selling/to the public. Although I found a certain divergence of opinion as to the 'exact spots', at different months of the year, where sweet water could be obtained, I think the information given in my not© will be found approximately correct. i? i 7 1s • it should be realized however that the ** sweat water llne ^ dividing the definitely salt water from the definitely sr/eet water does, and must, always vary with the strength of berth and bouth winds, cs well as with high tides and low tides* The n exact spota^ mentioned by me, are ol course where absolutely sweet water can be found, thou^ it will no doubt be appreciated that for a considerable distance below such points (say 2 miles) drinkable, though brackish water is always obtainable* (ill) As regards (G): I was Kindly assisted in obtaining material for my sketch by lieutenant Thomas, H.M., Navigating Officer of H*M # S*Shorehasu The latter gave it as his opinion that the * boundary ** of ’Iraq territorial waters towards the oped sea, must be considered to be 3 miles from the southern edge of the MARAKAT Abdulla Mud Fiat which, he sold, at deed low water (neap tide) is exposed as per sketch (See blue at hi #1 ti do lino) • This gives us/a distance of fully 10 miles of open water from Fa a promontory to the limits of ’Iraq’s terri- ^ torlal water* Whether Lieutenant Thomas’ estimate of the \ size of the mud flat is correct and whether his viewpoint as to the extent of ’Iraq’s territorial water is the right one, I exn not expert enough to say, but I should imagine that he is not far wrong in his views. III. You will recollect that His Excellency the Shaikh when discussing this matter with you October last, gave it an his opinion that drinkable though perhaps not entirely sweet water could be obtained all the year round lin an emergency) from a point outside ’Iraq’s 0 mi le - that is to say from a point approximately at the western entrance of the Hooka channel. He, evidently, like myself, had no idea of the snormous extent of the Karatet jvbctolla mud flat, or that such fist wne over entirely exposed which Im, says itie at/^3 , y %* A « SflU.M. 'rlATM, ATAIUBLa m kij ^ait Am IMMIDDI ATI VICIKI1Y. Inside the town proper of Kuwait, there are many salty and brackish wells which provide water for washing purposes, but only one exists which give good sweet water, but this only in small quantities. Immediately outside the town walls and close to the official Bedouin camping grounds, there ar© two groups of wells known as (a) A1 Basina (b) A1 Bhamiyeh. The former need not be considered in this note as thefce are only 40 wells, in poor condition. The latter i.e. the 'ShamiyeiT wells, consist of nearly 600 mall wells. They are situated in several groups to Jr the South tfest of the Town, and frora/a mile to a mile from the walls. Though th© number sounds imposing, the wells themselves ar© poor affairs, scooped out by hand, and in soma cases lying only a few feet apart. Bone of the wells are lined, and mostly are under a yard in diameter. The wells vary considerably in yield and quality, and also, to some extent, in accordance with the seasons of the year; some becoming rather brackish towards the ©nd of Summer. On© recently tested was 40 feet deep, and had 2 feet of water, yielding 4.5 gallons which, however, soon refilled.

This during ordinary flood years.

I hare gone through the report of the Iraq Customs Director, copy of which you sent me, and. I find it far from truth* To make quite certain about things, I renewed my inquiries into the matter, and I fully satisfied myself that the statement of Hasan f Ashoor and the survivors was the truth, and it has been proved that the Customs launch has for long made a practice of interfering and intercepting boats at any place (on the high seas)* The boat in question met the launch at the entrance of Khor Abdullah, and on© of the launch crew shouted to the crew to lower their sail* The latter from the start ware nervous that the launch would treat them as she had often treated other boats, namely that she would board then;, tear up their manifest, ant; tow their craft to Fao declaring her to be a pri&amp;e caught smug- gling, so that they (the launch craw) might win a reward from the Iraq Gowammmt, The nakhuda of the boat in ques tion clearly also became afraid, though he was in possession of a Fac manifest, which he had taken with him from Kuwait and decided to run for Kuwait and not submit to examination. Hext when the crew began to turn their sail i.e.(fc° legume thair course back) the launch fired a volley at them and killed two persons and wtmdncl two others.

Hated the 11th October 1935, From Lt.-Colonel II.B.I .Dickson, C.I.S, i # a P olitical A^ent, Kuwait; To The Hon’ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, B u g h i r -i resence of armed T Iraqi Customs launch in Kuwait waters, between Has chan Island and Khor Hubiyeh, Bir, In continuation of my telegram No.233, dated the 1st October 1933, I hare the honour to forward translation of a letter No.R/3/1255, dated the 13th Jaraad Than! 1352 (3rd October 1953), which I hare re ceived from Bis *ixeellency the Bhaikh of Kuwait. 2, His Excellency the Bhaiidi first reported the launch incident to me at a Tennis Party on 29th September at 5 P,M, , the day before the arrival of the senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf with 1st Destroyer Flotilla. He was clearly worried and asked me to telegraph a short summary of the incident to you at once. This I did on 1st October, as you are aware, and after His Excellency had also iiBntioned the incident to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. s 3, The Shaikh told me that he probably would not have heard of the matter for several days had he not himself visited Palaikah and Mas chan Islands on the morning of 29th September, whilst on his way back from the pearl banks where he had gone to give the signal for the return of the Kuwait pearling fleet (guffal)• 4, The inhabitants of the Island, he said, re-reported to him that they had seen the Fao Customs launch «* the previous evening, and on several occasions during the latter part of September, moving about in most sus picious manner between the entrance to Khor Subiyeh and Laschan island, and examining water boats and other sailing craft, who make a practice of using this channel when proceeding to and from Fao. Some of the islanders further testified that they had, on one occasion, seen the launch take shelter from a south east wind and anchor west of the qasr Subiyeh promontory, that is to say, actual -ly inside the bay of Kuwait. 5# According to the Shaikh also, one or two of the islanders whose fishing boats had been held up, volunteered the further Information that the launch crew bad told them that their role was to hold up all craft carrying merchan dise from Kuwait to Fao (except water and fishing boats) and convey them to Fao, and charge their owners with smuggling and that no manifests in their possession would help them, as the-re would be destroyed. This latter evi dence however, though important and though it bears out many other stories I have heard about the methods of Fao preventive officers, must be taken with reserve, I think. 6« In response to the Shaikh*s enquiry as to why they, the islanders, had not reported the presence of the launch to Kuwait earlier, they replied that as poor fishermen they had not dared to do so, lest their in- formation eventually come to the ears of the ’ao authori ties and they be punished by having their boats seized and nets destroyed (Not a difficult operation on a dark night). 7. On the 1st and Snd October the Shaikh at my request proceeded to make immediate enquiries from some nakhudf;s of water boats, which had just come in from Fao, Their evidence he incorporated in his letter of 3rd October to me (under reference).3 8, His Excellency verbally explained to me that he nad i-oond difficulty in making these men talk, for they one and all were engaged in carrying water from Fao, and some had a. amilies there# They were clearly afraid of consequences and begged him not to forward their names to the - olitical Agent (myself) as this would end in their certain ruin with the ?ao authorities who would certainly, in due course # be supplied with the whole story # of how they had informed. For this reason. His Excellency said that he was averse to divulging actual names, at any rate for the present# He had however got their written statements and could get others from the Falaika Islanders if necessary. 9* According to His Excellency some of the boatmen when being interrogated pointedly asked what he, the Shaikh, had been able to accomplish about the Kuwait boat which had been attacked by the self same launch on the high seas at the end of June last, and had had 2 men killed and 2 severely wounded out of a crew of six, (See my letter No#264, dated the 6th May 1933} • That inci dent, they said, was an utterly unprovoked attack on an innocent and harmless craft and happened far from the ’Iraq Coast, the whole local seafaring world knew this. The very presence of the said launch today near - aschan clearly proved, they said, that the ’Iraq authorities ordered her to go far afield, and also as clearly showed that neither he, the Shaikh, nor the Political Agent, hsa been able to get satisfaction or compel the Customs De partment to confine their activities to their own ter- ritorial waters. 10. As the Shaikh explained, and i fear I must agree with him entirely, the disturbing point about the whole thing is the irresponsible^ increased boldness shown by the Fao Customs authorities these days, for » i [l!l ti I their launches to act so far afield from 'Iraq waters Aafield from -Iraq waters as they are doing proves con clusively, x think, that (a) They are receiving direct encouragement to do so from higher authorities: (b) They are not in the least afraid of con- sequences* In other words they believe that His Majesty's Government the protecting power is either powerless to do anything, or does not wish to bring pressure on the 'Iraq Government. 11. In this connection I have only to refer you to the correspondence and especially to letter No.C/85, dated 24th June 1933 from the Director of Customs and 3xcise, Baghdad to the JV; inis try of Finance which was forwarded under your No*1145-S, dated the 31st August to illustrate what I mean. 12. I greatly regret to have to say it, but the story put forward bears every indication of having been entirely concocted* and if you will read my original despatch Ho.264, dated the 6th May 1933 carefully you will note that I prophesied that such a complete deniHa- would be put up by the Customs Department. The Kuwait story of the attack was simple and straightforward one on that occasion, and one would have liked to see the f Iraq Government do the honourable thing and admit excess of zeal on the part of their preventive police.Instead they, 2 months after the event took place, reply with the curious story that one armed launch (whose first volley had knocked out 4 men) could not single handed tackle a small dhow defended by 2 men only, but must needs send for another armed launch from Fao, to come to their assistance. They omit to mention that the 2 men ©soaped with their craft and brought her safely back to Kuwait, a not very creditable perfomance from their point of view if their story bore any relation to facts. -ll/- 5 - )S -11. I trust you will strongly press for a clear assurance from the ? Iraq Government that their armed patrols will not invade Kuwait waters again, and will con fine their activities to their own waters, otherwise the next thing we shall hear of will b© a sea fight between the bhaikhs armed forces and the Mraq Launch, which, needless to say, we all desire to avoid. li ,12. I am sending you 5 copies of this and trust that one may be passed to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, if you see no objection. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

Ko.569-3 of 1935. oritisli residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the 29th May, 1933. Biauggllng 'between Kuwait and ’Iraq. Sir, A\ ol I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s iX** * ' ^®^ter Bo. 20 of the 31st March, and to state that the proposals of the ’Iraq Government contained in it, for the co-operation of His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in check ing smuggling from Kuwait and * Iraq, were put before His Excellency, and that when passing through Kuwait recently on ray return from London I took the opportunity of discussing the matter with the Shaikh. The result, which 1 fear is far from being conclusive, is contained in the attached copy of a letter, Ho. R-2/916 dated the 18th May, from His Excellency to Colonel Dickson. I cannot lialp feeling that the somewhat ’non-co-operative' attitude of the Shaikh is - at any rate in part - due to the non-accommodating stand taken, in some matters which concern him, by the 'Iraq Government, (vide the incident mentioned In my despatch No.107-S, dated the 1st February 1935), and also to the arbitrary methods employed by the ’Iraq Customs authorities, culminating in the killing of two Kuwaiti boatmen, and the wounding of two others, as iLqH reported in my despatch i!o.567-8 of to-day's date. As long as such incidents continue to occur it is difficult for me to influence the Shaikh in the right direction. 2. As will be seen the Shaikh begins his letter with the bald statement that ”no such snuggling takes place”. This /of Ma j esty f s Amb assador, British Embassy, Bagdad.'V - 2 - of courae must be taken with a grain, or rather helping, of salt. There is no doubt that smuggling does take place, and I imagine that His Excellency's categorical denial is due to the fact that he is afraid that any admission on his part of contraband from his territory would be used in some way against him by the 'Iraq authorities of whom unfortunately he is intensely auspicious -not entirely perhaps without cause* The extent of the smuggling which actually takes place is certainly a factor in the Kuwait-’Iraq smuggling problem* fh© Director of Customs (’Iraq) jjut the figure of smuggled goods during 1932 as high as £60,000/- (vide para graph 3 of Colonel Dickson’s letter forming an enclosure to my Printed letter Ho*258-3 of 21st March 1933)* Colonel Dickson proceeded in his letter to contest this figure, and as far as I am in a position to judge with some success. Amongst other arguments Colonel Dickson pointed out (vide paragraph 5 of his letter) that since the total imports into Kuwait from all sources did not exceed some £180,000/- it was hardly reasonable to suppose that one-third of these imports was smuggled across the ’Iraq frontier* 3* The rest of the Shaikh’s letter is merely an expression of pious intentions, and he avoids a specific reply to any of the proposals for co-operation with the ’Iraq authorities, except with regard to the placing of a steam boat at the mouth of the Bhatt-el-Arab ’which suggestion he will consider carefully’. As this proposal was one of the measures which the ’Iraq Government suggested, I presume that it is the Shaikh who is expected to provide a steam-boat and not the 1 Iraq authorities* If this is not the case, and it is the latter who are to provide the vessel, the point can be quietly dropped* 4, At the conclusion of his letter the Shaikh asks a pertinent question; why is Kuwait singled out as sole /culprit? ^ Iculprit? -ne iiejd *border, for instance, also marches with that of Viraq, and (as for siauggllng hy sea) there were other otates with ports on the Gulf 'besides Kuwait. As the BhaUch saia to me in the course of our conversation, he did not understand why, if smuggling does go on, a w dead set” was made against Kuwait only? Why did not the ♦Iraq authorities tackle Bin Baud, for example, on the subject? One has indeed only to look at the map to see that Saudi Arabia is in just a good position as Kuwait for smuggling into ♦Iraq, and - if the extent of the contraband approaches the figure given by the Director of Customs (paragraph 2 above) - then Bin Baud’s subjects have imdoubtedly taken a large hand in it. 5. Inconclusive as the Shaikh’s letter may appear I am not without hope that finally some measure of co-operation will be forthcoming from him. When I passed through Baghdad on my way to London on April 11th Sir Francis Humphry© was good enough to arrange a meeting between Mr. Siewright, the Director of the ’Iraq Customs, and myself, at which we discussed the question of Kuwait-’Iraq smuggling. Mr. Bievwrlght mentioned the proposal of an ’Iraqi Cub toms official at Kuwait* (1 (a) of the Ambassador’s letter of 31st March), and on my saying that I did not think the Shaikh would agree to tills, suggested that a special Kuwaiti Customs official might perhaps meet the case from the ’Iraq point of view. I mentioned this possibility to the Shaikh, not as coming from the f Xraq author ities, and His Excellency was inclined to favour the suggestion, though he has not mentioned this point in his letter* 5 , fhere are two other points on which I would Ilk© to touch. The ’Iraq Government suggest that the Political Agent, Kuwait, might under talc© the duties proposed for the Iraq official at Kuwait ((l) (b) of the Ambassador’s letter). Frankly this proposal does not appeal to me as I feel the more the Political Agent, as a British Official, is kept out of Kuwaiti-’Iraq bickerings, the better.- 4 - 7 * The othor is that of a suhaidy from the iraq. Govemwat to the Shaikh to meet the latter’s extra expenses in co-operative measures against smuggling. The proposal was first mentioned in Sir Francis Humphrys- letter Ho. SO. 629, dated the 3rd May 1938, to the Colonial Office in connection with the date gardens, and my views were given in paragraph 10 of my despatch No. 34, dated the 16th August 1938, to His Majesty’s Secretary of state for the Colonies. In principle there are objections to a subsidy from a foreign Power to a small State in special treaty relations with us. As long, however, ae this subsidy could be camouflaged as part of the compensation for the date gardens, its objection able .features were not so apparent. The situation now, however, as I understand it, is that the ’Iraq Government will only give the subsidy separately and as a direct payment to the Shaikh on account of his anti-smuggling co-operation. This undisguised form makes the proposal somewhat more difficult of acceptan.ce. Presumably it might be given in two ways* Either (a) a lump sum to cover all expenses would be given which the ’Iraq Government might feel themselves at liberty to curtail if they were dissatisfied with the results of the Shaikh’s co-operation, or (b) a sum to cover certain specific items of co-operation, such as the placing of a a team-boat at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, (gee paragraph 3 above), and the provision of a specific number of extra guards to watch the Kuwait land frontier. (b) would be the less objectionable form of the two. 'For the present, however, I would like to keep an open mind on the question of a subsidy* 8 . Personally I am most anxious that relations between Kuwait and ’Iraq should be of a friendly nature, and that any obstacle to such relations should be removed. Apart from any more ethical considerations, there is no doubt that whether ’Iraq - vis h vis Kuwait - has right upon her side in any /particular^ 6lo - 5 - &amp;? particular incident, she certainly - in their mutual relations as a whole - has might. Kuwait is the smaller Power of the two, and there are many ways in which 'Iraq, can make things % ' J ' U H 'i- i 0 ■■hi 4 ' '.O'- ' a ° St for ^ and his people. Kuwait, for example, gets its fresh water supply in Kuwaiti water boats from the Shatt-el-Arab, 1. e* * Iraq territorial waters. ’Iraq has only to close, or threaten to close, the Shatt to these ooa x&gt;s 9 (which I suppose she could do), or exercise vexatious restrictions on their movements under the plea of anti-smuggling measures, for Kuwait to be put in a serious predicament. the situation as it stands at present I think that the beet line to pursue would be for Mr. Sievwright, or the local Director of Customs at Basrah, to visit Kuwait, and have a quiet talk with the Shaikh, Colonel Dickson and myself, if I can get over there. It may be that the result of this friendly discussion will be that soma co-operation will be forthcoming from Kuwait, which will be unobjectionable from the point of view of the Shaikh, and acceptable to ’Iraq. I have not broached this suggestion to the Shaikh but have no reason to suppose that he will offer any objection. I venture to suggest therefore that at the present stage the ’Iraq Govern ment might be informed in general terms that in reply to their proposals His Excellency the Shaikh has sent a friendly reply, but has not touched on their detailed proposals. That I have suggested the friendly ’round table’ discussion, mentioned above, and that if the ’Iraq authorities concur I will suggest it to the Shaikh, and arrange a date. 1 feel, however, that the success of the discussion will depend not a little on the explanation which the ’Iraq Government have to offer on the incident reported in my letter No. 567-S of today’s date quoted in paragraph 1 above. /I■ ('Zli 1 am sending a copy of this despatch to His . ’ajesty's Secretary of State for India and to the Govern- ment or India.

The position is not altogether easy. On the one hand the Resident’; objections to a subsidy are very forcible. On the other, there are fairly considerable practical s in associating any payment in return lor anti-smuggling measures with such compensation as it may ultimately be necessary to pay to the Sheikh in respect of his Iraq date gardens. It will be remembered that there are two points in issue in the case of the date gardens - possession and tax exemption, and that the proposal at present under consideration is that the Iraq Government should validate the Sheikh’s title, thereby ensuring his possession, and that H.M.G. in return for this should compensate him for the loss of his tax exemption. If a settlement on this basis proves possible, there will be no direct payment to the Sheikh,under which an anti-smuggling grant can be camouflaged, on the part of Iraq, and there is clearly no reason why any expenditure should fall upon H.M.G. Alternatively, if it proves Impossible to validate the Sheikh’s title/title, his first remedy, as matters stand, in respect of dispossession, will hs against the successful claimants to his property and again there may be no question of any direct payment to him by the Iraq Government. We need not, however, go into the matter in too great detail at this stage.

[ 1^5/15/55J Britisn Embassy Baghdad, 31st March 1933 Sir The 'Iraqi Government have asked that the co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait should be sought in the institution of preventive measures to combat the extensive smuggling of contraband from Kuwait to 'Iraq. Some details of the nature ot t-tie smuggling and of the importance attached to it by the * Iraqi Government are given in the letter addressed to your Secretary by the Financial Secretary to the High Commissioner, Uo*?976 of September 30th last* The measures which the ’Iraqi Government suggest that the Shaikh should take are as f ollowsi - (1) (a) No goods should be allowed to be shipped from Kuwait to ’Iraq before obtaining a permit for each shipment. This permit, together with the shipping documents1 manifests) should be authenticated by an ’Iraqi customs official in Kuwait who should send copies of the permit and the shipping document to the Customs Collect orate, Basrah, informing them of the quantity of the goods shipped from Kuwait to ’Iraq, so that they may require the importers to produce this quantity. The ’Iraqi Government suggest that the British Political Agent at Kuwait could carry out the duties proposed for the ’Iraqi official mentioned above. 12) (a) That a small stearwboat should be placed at the mouth/ The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire.moutn of tne Siiatt-al-Arab to watcn the movements of boats, (b) That adequate control should be introduced on land. 2. I have the honour to request that these proposals may be laid before the Shaikh of Kuwait and that he may be invited .,o state if he is willing to co-operate with the 'Iraqi Government in the manner proposed. The question is of some urgency and 1 should be obliged if the Shaikh could be asked to give it his immediate attention. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd.) F*H•HUMPHRYS.- 2 - as such incidents continue to occur it is difficult for me to influence the Shaikh in the right direction* 2. As will be seen the Shaikh begins his letter with the bald statement that -no such smuggling takes place-. This of course must be taken with a grain, or rather helping, of salt. There is no doubt that smuggling does take place, and I imagine that His Excellency’s categorical denial is due to the lact that he is afraid that any admission on his part of contraband from his territory would be used in some way against him by the ’Iraq authorities of whom unfortunately he is intensely suspicious - not entirely perhaps without cause* The extent of the smuggling which actually takes place is certainly a factor in the Kuwait- ? Iraq smuggling problem. The Director of Customs ( f Iraq) put the figure of smuggled goods during 1932 as high as £ 60,000/- (vide paragraph 3 of Colonel Dickson’s letter forming an enclosure to my Printed letter Ko.258-S of 21st March 1933)* Colonel Dickson proceeded in his letter to contest this figure, and as far as I am in a position to judge with some success* Amongst other arguments Colonel Dickson pointed out (vide paragraph 5 of his letter) that since the total imports into Kuwait from all sources did not exceed some £ 180,000/- it was hardly reasonable to suppose that one-third of these imports was smuggled across the ’Iraq frontier. 3. The rest of the Shaikh’s letter is merely an expression of pious intentions, and he avoids a specific reply to any of the proposals for co-operation with the ’Iraq authorities, except #ith regard to the placing of a steam boat/ \8team-boat at the mouth of the Stott-ei-Arab •which euggeetion he will consider carefully*. a. this proposal ms one of the measures which the 'Iraq liove toent suggested. I presume that it ia the shaikh who is expected to provide a steam-boat and not the 'Iraq authorities. If this is not the case, and u is the latter who are to provide the vessel, the point can be quietly dropped. ^tne conclusion of his letter the Bh&amp;ikh asks a pertinent questions why is Kuwait singled out as the sole culpriti ihe l^ejd border, for instance* also marches with tn&amp;t of 1 Iraq* and (ae for smuggling by sea) there were other States with ports on the Gulf besides Kuwait. As the Shaikh said to me in the course of our conversation* he did not under stand why, if smuggling does go on, a 'dead set* was made against Kuwait only? tffcy did not the ‘Iraq authorities tackle Bin Saud, for example, on the subject? One has indeed only to look at the map to see that Saudi Arabia is in Just &amp;£ good position as Kuwait for smuggling into ’Iraq, and - if the extent of the contraband trade approaches the figure given by the Director of Customs (paragraph 2 above)-then Bin Gaud’s subjects have undoubtedly taken a large hand in it. h. Inconclusive as the Jhaikh’s letter may appear I am not without hope that finally some measure of co-operation will mxifc be forthcoming from him. hen I passed through Baghdad on my way to London on April 11th Bir Francis Humphrys was good enough to arrange a meeting between Mr. B1 evwright,and the Director of the ’Iraq Customs, and myself, at which we discussed the question of Kuwait-’Iraq smuggling. Mr. Sievwright mentioned the proposal of an ’Iraqi Customs official at Kuwait* (l (a) of the/(v£) U*? the Aateasador' s letter of Slat Mareb), and on ay eaytng tnat I aid not tbink tbe Sbaikb would agree to tbis, suggested that a special Kuwait^ Cust ma official night perhaps meet the case from the 'Iraq point of riew. x mentioned tbis possibility to the Shaikh, not as coming from tne 'Iraq authorities, and His Excellency was inc. ined to i avour the liug&amp;estion, tUougn ne lias not sientioned tfaio point in his letter* 6. there are two other points on which I would like to touch. The ’Iraq Government suggest that the Political *gent f Kuwait, might undertake the duties proposed for the ’Iraq official at Kuwait (U) (b) of the /ambassador’s letter^. Frankly this proposal does not appeal to me as I feel the more the Political Agent, as a British Official, is kept out of Kuwaiti- 1 Iraq bickerings, the bet er. 7. the other point is that of a subsidy from the ’Iraq Government to the Shaikh to meet the latter’s extra expenses in co-operative measures against smuggling. The proposal was first mentioned in Sir Francis humphrys’ letter ho.BO* 629, dated the 3rd May 1932, to the Colonial Oifiee in connection with the date gardens, and my views were given in paragraph 10 of my despatch lfo.34, dated the 16th August 1932, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies. In principle there are objections to a subsidy ir oie e&lt; t oi uf _i; Power to a small State in special treaty relations with us. AB long, however, as this subsidy could be camouflaged as part of the compensation for the date gardens its objection able features were not so apparent. ^he situation now, however,/«* nowever, a a x under.thnd it, i B that the 'Iraq CJovernment will only give the subsidy separately and as a direct payment to the bhaikh on account of his anti-smuggling co-operation. This undisguised form makes the proposal somewhat more difficult of acceptance. Presumably it might be given in two ^ays. liither laj e lump s.-.m to cover all erpeuses would be ^iven which the 'Iraq SoTernaent might feel theme sir ea at liberty to curtail if they were dissatisfied with the results of the Shaikh's co- -peration, or (b) a sum to cover certain specific items of co-operation, such as the placing of a steam-boat at the mouth of the iinatt-el-Arab,(see paragsaph 3 above), and the provision of a specifio number of extra guards to watch the Kuwait land frontier. (b) would be the iesa objectionable form of the two. Jfor the present, however, 1 would like to keep an open mind on tne question of a subsidy. 8* i ersonally I am most anxious tliat relations between Kuwait and * Iraq should be of a friendly nature, and that any obstacle to such relations should be removed# Apart from any more ethical considerations, there is no doubt that whether ’Iraq « vis a vis Kuwait * has right upon her side in any particular incident, she certainly • in their mutual relatione as a whole - has might# Kuwait is the smaller Power of the two, and there are r.mny ways in which ’Iraq can make things most unpleasant for the Shaikh and hia people# Kuwait, for exrmple, gets its fresh water supply in Kuwaiti water boats from the uhhtt«el-Arab,i*e. ’Iraq territorial waters. ’Iraq has only to close, or threaten to close, the Chatt to these boats, (which I suppose she could do;, or exercise vexatious restrict lions on their movements under the plea or anti- siauggling/ssau^gXia^siBures, fcx Kuwait to foe put in a serious predicament* taKe tne situation as it stands at present X think tixat tne best line to pursue would be for Mr* sier- wrigiit, or tiie local Director of Customs at Basrah, to visit Kuwait, and have a quiet talk with the Shaikh, Colonel Xickson and myself, if X can get over there. it may be that the result of this friendly discussion will be that some co-operation will be forthcoming from Kuwait, which will be unobjectivhable from the point of view of the Shaikh, and acceptable to ‘Iraq. I have not broached this suggest! on to the Shaikh but have no reason to suppose that he will offer any objection. I venture to suggest therefore that at the present stage the ‘Iraq Government might be informed in general terms that in®ply to their proposals His excellency the Shaikh has sent a friendly reply, but has nut touched, on their detailed proposals. that I have suggested the friendly ’round table 1 discussion, mentioned above, and that if the ’Iraq authorities concur I will suggest it to the Shaikh, and arrange a date. I feel, however, that the success of the discussion will depend not m little on the explanation which the ‘Iraq Government have to offer on the incident reported in my letter Bo.b67-s of to-day*s date quoted in paragraph 1 above. X am sending a copy of this despatch to his Majesty’s Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India# I have the honour to be, sir, your most obedient servant, (Sgd. ) f.C.Fowle, It.-Colonel, political hesident in the Persian Gvli.Notes.

Please see sir Francis Humphrys' letter of 11th January to the Foreign Office on P.2.705/33. Colonel Dickson's report is a very useful corrective to the rumours of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq about which we have heard a good deal lately. The suggestion was, in fact, at one stage made that a possible method of meeting the problem- of the date gardens woula be that whatever amount was paid in settlement of his claim by the Iraq Government to the Sheikh should be expressed as being in return for his co-operation in the prevention of smuggling.

I see that Fowle sent you direct a copy of hie despatch to India Ho. 792-S of the 19th October, about King Faisal*s recent enquiries on the subject of possible visits by him to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Fowle proposes to treat each esse on its merits, whan it arises; and the Government of India have expressed agreement. But we here are disposed to think: that any visit by King Faisal to one of these States would be in principle undesirable. The India Office, we understand eemi-offici lly, are inclined to agree. There seem, to us to be various indications that King Pei sal wishes to try to bring Koweit gradually into closer connexion with Iraq, and that he would favour anything which would tend toward an agglomeration of Arab States under his own aegis. ,4s regards Koweit, it has been laid down by the C. I.D as recently as 1929 that 'as regards Koweit, it is better 'on toe whole that... while endeavouring to secure so far 'as possible that Koweit shall not be identified with «Iraq, we should defer the establishment oi a lormsl 'protectorate until circumstances appear to make this 'more clearly desirable'. You will see then taat our view is entirely against any closer connexion between Iraq and Koweit. As regards the trucial Sheikhdoms, a v isit by King Pei sal would, it seems to us, be highly embarrassing in view of tue traditional policy of allowing them no direct contact with foreign Powers. We His Excellency Sir Francis Humuhrys, G.C. •&lt; . , etc., etc., G.C.

It would, of course, be for consideration, if the case arises, whether such discouragement could be administered without risking a disproportionately serious political reaction, but it mi gut very well be desirable for the Resident or yourself to nave a definite ruling to go on tnat in principle il.M, Government are against such visits, as immediate action would probably be required. I should tuerefore be grateful to know your views on this matter before discussing it further with the India Office. Yours etc. (hGD) GEOHOB R&amp;NDSL.

My de r Rendel, Please refer to your letter E 6535/6054/91 of the * 'tii December on the subject of possible visits by King t’aisal to the Arab btales of tu.„ Persian Gulf. I agree that, in principle, such visits should bo firmly discouraged unless there is some very special reason for making an exception. In the case f the Trucial shaikh dome, it should not be difficult for me to dissuade King Faisal from carrying out any intention he might have of paying them a visit. The esse of Kuwait seems to me to be on a different footing and, though I am personally against the establishment of any closer connection between Kuwait and ■ Iraq than exists at present, it will obviouel/ be much m re difficult to convince King Faisal of the justice of our claim that Kuwait is out of bounds for him. You will remember that the Shaikh of Kuwait paid King Faisal a visit in Bagdad last summer, while T was absent in Europe, and it might be claimed by Faisal that it would be discourteous on Ms art not to return tile vielt. Then there ie the interminable question of the date gardens, and tne prevention of smuggling from Kuwait into ’Iraq which has lately assumed rather serioue proportions. The Director of Customs recently told me that he eetimated that more than £60,000 worth of goods had been smuggled into G.W* RiiNDEL, &amp;SQ. , C.M.G.into 'Iraq from Kuwait during the past year, and tnat a member of bis staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers. It is true tiut both thete matters ar^ rot proper subjects for King Faisal to tackle personally, but it might not be easy to put him off a visit to Kuwait for the ostensible purpose of arranging a settlement of such outstanding questions, though the real object of the visit would undoubtedly be political. While, therefore, I Should like to be instructed to use my influence to prevent the King paying a return visit to Kuwait, I assume that every endeavour will be made at the other end to prevent the Shaikh himself encouraging the idea should the question arise.

I am directed by His Excellency the Acting High Commissioner to refer to your despatch Wo.1112,da.ted the 28th of May, 1932,reading the preventive measures recently taken by the 'Iraqi Customs at &amp;o in connection with Kuwaiti water boats. 2. The representations of His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait have been comunicated to the 'Iraqi Government authorities,both demi-officially through toe ^ Director of Customs and Excise,and officially through the Minister for Foreigi Affairs. It is cl ear, however, that both British and 'Iraqi officials concerned are con* vinced of the necessity to exercise strict control over all vessels entering the Shatt-al-Arab in view of the very considerable contraband traffic from Kuwait to 'Iraq. I attach a copy of a letter from the Director of Customs giving recent statistics of this traffic. There is evidently much to be said for their point of view and it is difficult to press them to permit special concessions for the water boats unless His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait is prepared in some way to guarantee that these boats will not engage in snuggling. I have now received from the Ministry for Foreiga Affairs official observation i'HE SECRETARY TO THE HONOURABLE THE POLITICAL RESIDENT IN THE PERSIAN GULF:'BU SHIRE. onio.6851 of 27.8.32. 3^7.32. on the representations in question. These are contained in the enclosed translated extract of a letter from Wj Ministry ox Finance. His Excellency fears,therefore, that the only possible reply to the Shaikh on the subject of the water boats is that the 'Iraqi Government regret that they do not see their way to permit any special con- cession for these boats unless Mis Excellency the Ruler ox Kuwait is prepared in some way to guarantee that they will not engage in smuggling. 3. You will observe that reference is mde in the enclosed letoer from the Ministry of Finance to an instance where smugglers fired on an ’Iraqi Customs launch. There is no doubt that smugglers are now having frequent recourse to fire-arms and that this aspect of the matter is a serious one. I enclose an extract from the Times of Mesopotamia dated the 27th of August describing an affray in the desert near Zubair between 'Iraqi Preventive men and smugglers from Kuwait in which an 'Iraqi Customs employee was killed. His Excellency understands that the contents of this article are substantially correct. 4. His Excellency the Acting High Commissioner also directs me to*fefer to your despatch No. 1228 dated the 15th of June,1932, forwarding representations on behalf of a particular water boat Nakhoda,named Sulaiman bin Ahmad al amar, who complains of high handed treatment on the part of 'Iraqi Customs officials. Demi-official action has been taken in this case; and I attach a copy of a re port received from the Preventive officer at Fao . In for warding it,both the British Customs uollector at Basrah and the Director of Customs-and Excise are agreed in thinking that 'there is a little ground for complaint but it appears to have been considerably magnified'. In the circum stances, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were not approached officially in the case pending receipt of their reply to the generalgeneral representations made in remrd to le^ard to the water boats. Now that this has been received His TTvo^n e-&amp;ivea,His Excellency is inclined, SU ^ U ° y ° Ur concurre nce,to take no official action in regard to the complaint of Suleiman ibn Ahmad al Amr.

Cooper,Esq., Collector of Customs and Excise, Basrah. with reference to his ho.5397 dated 30th ultimo.General of Customs and Excise).'' Reference your letter No.4459 dated 7 th July, 1932. After making enquiries,throu# the Directorate General of Customs ana Excise,regarding the contents of H.E. the Hi$i Commissioner's letter No. 5488 dated 30th June, 1932,it app, appears uhat the Customs official detailed for control in B&amp;o has issued orders in September last that all boats entering Shatt- el-Arab should come to Fao and report their arrival. The fee oi 9 annas referred to represents eight annas paid to the clerk (who is not a government official) fot writing the report,and one anna stamp affixed on the report in question. There is no objection to the report being prepared by the hokhada himself or by others who can write. The place from where the boats i take their water is,during the greater part of the year,when the water is low (nine months a year),in the neighbourhood of Fao,and, during the flood, far away from Fao. The Collector of Customs and Excise,Basrah assures us that no delay is exercised in the inspection of water boats as they are now being given preference over others at the time of inspection which takes place twice a day on the arrival of the boats when the tide is on the flood. The reason which led the customs official, supported by the Collectorate of Customs,to adopt the measures in question in connection . , . , . , . . ^rith these boats is the smuggling which is taking place on a large scale from Kuwait to Iraq. The reason for this smuggling is the low customs duties charged in Kuwait in com parison with the corresponding duties charged in *11 aq. In order to illustrate how much money the Jlraqi Treasury is losing on account of this smuggling,it is sufficient to give the quantity of smuggled goods confiscated by the ’Iraqi Ou stomsCustoms Department dur mg the first half of this year. Deeds ; 3 tfl6 ' alUe ° f ^ 10 ° dinars ha ^ ^en confiscated during that period . Tne Uollecter of Customs and Ixcise.Basrah, assures us that the goods confiscated are less than, one tenth ° f th ° Se sm S^ ed int '° ^aq. AH these goods, such as sugir, tea, coffee, saccharine,gold thread and matches are liable to high customs duty. The question of smuggling has become an extremely serious one. The snuggiers have now armed themself and do not hesitate to fire at Customs officials when they aieet them. Both sea and land smugglers are now armed. An incident occurred recently when a boat smuggling goods from Kuwait fired at a steam launch belonging to the’iraqi Customs, wrnch ms chasing the smugglers, ffe do not claim that sea smuggling is restricted to water boats alone. Smuggling is now being practised Dy all boats including water boats in which smuggled goods have actually been confiscated. The measures now adopted by the Iraqi Customs Department in this connection do not apply only to the water boats,but to all boats alike. It was not the intention of the Customs Department to cause inconvenience to the people of Kuwait by taking severe action against the boats which carry water to them. Their sole object is to safeguard the interest of the Iraqi Treasury within * Iraqi territory. The smuggling in question is not a new thing as it has been engaging the attention of the Customs Department since 1934. The arrangements made recently with the assistance of armed motor cars along the Zubair road have, to a certain extent,reduced smuggling by land. This led the smugglers to concentrate all their efforts on sea smuggling. As strict control over boats at Kao hinders the activities of the smugglers,the latter have taken the water boats,and the vital service they render to the people of Kuwait,as an excuse for demanding the removal of the ’Iraqi customs control.Copy Extract from'Ihe Times of Mesopotasiia',Basrah,dated v^c tur cay, the 27th o f Augu st, 1932. FULL DETAILS OF ZUBAIR FIGHT Customs Qolchi Dea-d. Captured Bandits Known to Police. We regret to announce that the Customs Qolchi,by name Jabbar Odda.who was injured in the fight with smugglers on me desert near Alluwi on Thursday morning has since died of Ids wounds. The full story of the outrage which is now to hand, reads like an Arabian Mights romance,yet is actually only w, incident in one constant light which the Customs Department has to wage daily in the never ending struggle against smugglers and bandits on lraq f s vast desert frontier. 'y. Actually Thursday's affray was only the climax of a very much larger affair,which involved an attempt to smuggle 30 camels load of goods illegally into the country. Word came to the Customs Department on August 20th that a caravan of a suspicious nature was proceeding across the desert near Rafiyah. A Customs car was sent in search and eventually located the party consisting of 25 men. After being challen ged they were fired upon and a running fire ensued during which the head Qolchi was slightly wounded. As the Customs party had by now exhausted their ammunition the head qolchi instructed his party to stand by and observe the movements of the caravan,while he himself returned to Zubair in the car. Reinforcements on Scene. The Preventive Officer at Zubair telephoned the incident through to Basrah,and thereupon the Chief Preventice Officer (Sayid Ahmad Bey en-Naqib) immediately left with reinforcements axidproceeded to the spot in a taxi, Xroi car ^ also sent separately j-ty obtained Police assistance accompanied by the original patrol car \?hen theya»rived it was airee^dy dark and the could no longer be lonfl.f.Rri S H wro X 1 r car* could no longer be lon 53 .f,«ri S VI H rurt-i X 1 i r caravan j vx ox^uu. ne accordinj v:ent on there and at daybreak found 6 camels unloaded,with two aen Wlth them * ^ i3ein S questioned the men finally admitted having; ha.d the goods and hidden them in the desert and promisee to guide the officer to the place.

Later it transpired that the second patrol car of the Department had also obtained information of their whereabouts and had immediately come and removed them to safety. The contraband articles included sugar,tea,matches, cig^retts papers and numerous other articles* The next day the first patrol car located another 4 camels loaded with tea. They were captured and taken into custody* On Monday evening the Customs Department received in formation at Headquarters that a large caravan had left Eoweit for Shatra. Accordingly at daybreak the next morning a party including the Deputy Collector was sent out with both the Patrol cars to Shegra,near Ghabisiiiyah,a well known spot for hiding stolen or smuggled goods. On the way Sayid Ahmad obtained information of another 4 camelr loads hidden in the desert. By this time 14 loads out of the original number of 30 had been found and captured. Suspicious Party. The two cars remained near Shegra until daybreak on Thursday morning when they went to Alluwi for water. On the way theCOPY Report, by Philip Ef f.

Watchman Mahmoud had his uniform coat on over his disdasha ano Bellumchi Zaalan had his ordinary clothes on, as . Bellamchia are not supplied with uniforms. None of the C. onicials here have ever been out on patrol in disguises When they had reached the mouth of the river they saw a water boflm anchored. As they did not have enough fresh water with them, theysteered towards the said boom to take a supply. Whan they had approached within a rope’s throw of the boom, they called on the crew whowere looking on to catch the rope,but they were ignored. So they anchored a short distance away and asked them to lengthen their anchor rope to come alongside. After some time they did so,and the officials boarded the boom and examined it,after which they asked for 3 or 4 tins of fresh water which were given them and left. It has been denied by the said officials that they beat any of the crew,althou^i they admit having spoken to them rather sharply, for not allowing them to board the boomboom at first. The Nakhuda' s excuse was ttet he did not reco^iise tnem at first,and thought they were pirates. Is it not rather strange that he did not recognise them when they were within a rope's throw,but admits having recogxised them when their bellsm was anchored farther away ?. It lnay also be noted that watchman Malmouri and bellumchi Zahlan have been posted for duty at Jho for the last five years and there are few nakhudas plying between Jfeo and Kuwait who do not know at least the latter. how if this nakhuda was ireaMy ill-treated by the said officials r why did he not come and complain to me about oheir conduct,when I would have enquired into the matter there and then. , Further this man who professes to be law abiding etna oi whom it has been stated as bearing an exemplary char a c oer, knows fully well that the law stipulates that as soon as he entered Iraq territory he was to report at this post for the necessary declaration and examination. ^ow that the question of these water booms has come up, I be® to state that the nakhudas of these craft are the prime offenders here, so far as rules and regulations are concerned. Owing to fresh water being available at the mouth of the river during the months of April-June,I have come across these water booms, times without number,having fairriiwed from Kuwait,and anchored between this post and the mouth of the river,when the wind and tide was in their favour. Often I would meet them having arrived loaded with water and leaving for Kuwait without calling here. Wheney See the Cust °ffls iaunch on patrol,they come up for examination but when no ^trol i B in Sle}lt&gt;they quietly leave without calling. In fact they have eaumg us into a sort of hide and seek business. . , the ° ther hari u&gt; c °n si dering the human business m *ich they are occupied, they have been enjoying exceptional treatment. later booms arriving- here have had th6ir formaliti e« completed and released with as kittle delay as possible at all hours of the da y and ni,^. In fact every facility has been afforded them and I do not see that they have any grounds for complaint. Nakhudas of water booms have also been known to en@ige m smuggling and two or three of them are quite notorious m this line. Many of them carry passengers, with baggage as well as dutiable goods. In my opinion,what these nakhudas of water booms are actually aiming at is to evade coming up to this station ior the sole reason that they consider that, as they do not carry any dutiable goods, they should be free from direct Customs supervision so that they nay smuggle goods whenever an opportunity presents itself. They also take into consideration that by not calling here,they would be saved from payment of Port does and writer’s fees.ioa n , / 12 b Communications on this subject should be addressed to The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted ^ ^7/ O'U T'S G llejerence to previous correspondence Letter the Colonial Office of the Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonie A copy has also been sent to the ENCLOSURE M WEEKLY LtTTES I No. C 31 4 4 {/ 5 , igjj FROM SECRETARY, POUTKSAt AND 8ECRE1 0EPT, 1101 ©siA OFF!OF Colonial Office, Downing Street, X ; vA^193^.

His Excellency the Shaikh is much concerned at the delays occasioned by this new order, luring recent months, it would have been possible for the water boats to take their requirements of fresh water close to the mouth of the river, without proceeding up the river as far as Fas. Compliance with the instructions of the ♦Iraqi Customs authority has thus put them to much additional trouble and delays especially when the wind is in the berth and the tide on the ebb. They are liable to be subjected to further delays on leaching Fas: sometimes boats arrivingarriving in the morning are not allowed to to leare until Will see their way to withdraw the new Customs order requiring the water«*bo&amp;ts to report at F&amp;q t 3. His Excellency the High Comisaloner understanda thHt Kuwait draws four-fifths of ito water supply from tile mouth of the 3hatt-Al-Arob, and some forty-two dhows, containing great storage tanks, are permanently engaged in the traffic. The system has been in vogue for very many years, infact is a 'life necessity ' for the people of Kuwait, whose local 'well' supply only suffices for about one-fifth of its population, which numbers aome 60,000 souls. In practice It is the object of the water boats to proceed to the spot where the water Is found to be just sweet, md this naturally varies with the flow or ebb of the tide, and whether the dha11-al-Arab is in flood (early &amp;wmwv) or is running dead low (winter)* It follows therefore that wat^r boats at times fill their tanks on the i^ao Bar, out of sight of land, and at other times have to enter the mouth of the river and get their water between Fao village and the mouth of the river. On very rare occasions they actually have to go north of Pao and draw water between that place and Abadan• 4, his hate ell @ncy the High Commissioner is not aware of the reason for the introduction of the new regulations, whereby the ’Iraqi Customs authorities require that Kuwait water boats must proceed up the river and go some 8 miles up stream to Pao village* Presumably■t’reaumably Preventive 0ffi cer3 are ftf toata might engage in contraband traf by examination of each boat to insure “ 13 3;Aai ttad however that, while ti are afraid that water with large water tanks ishich fill ►oats unencumbered up the whole body of the boat, and would certainly for preference choose the Khor 3ubiyeh or Khor Abdulla route and land his cargo on the many lonely reaches lying between Urn %asr md the mouth of the ohatt~Al-Arab • 3* His Excellency the Shaihh of Kuwait makes no complaint against the payment to the 1 Iraqi authorities of the monthly tax which water boats pay (port dues), nor does he raise the question of the new nine annas per boat which is now apparently further demanded of them* He clearly recognises that ‘Iraq is within her righta in imposing any taxation she chooses within her territorial waters* #hat he does complain of, perhaps with justice, is (a) the forcing of water boats that possibly may be drawing water actually out of sight of land, to sail up to kao to report them sol Tea, even though Find and tide be against them* (b) The delaying of such boats many hours opposite to the Fao Customs Office, until the officials there allow them to leave* 6* Hie Excellency the High Commissioner is assured that the mow regulations have undoubtedly caused the price of water to go up in Kuwait and must bear very hardly on that town during the summer months unless cancelled or modified* The Shaikh and people of Kuwait consider2 copies tos- The Ministry of finance, Baghdad. consider that long eetabliehed usage Me eiTen thea the right to draw drinking water from fee Aatt.fll.Arab estuary without interference from Customs officials, especially as they do not attempt to erode the payment of dues* 7 * x » Rawing th eat tent ion of the * Iraqi Government to these representations, His Mmellmcy r,he High Coassiigaloner recommends thera to f&amp;rowtuhXe consideration, and suggests that the possibility of cancelling the new Customs rules be e;&amp;a®lnecu If cancellation is not entirely possible, he trusts that oiuy tease bo at 9 which are obliged to enter the river will be required to call at rao, and that It will be sufficient far others, drawing water south of the actual entrance, to be visted from tine to time by motor patrol boats if such course be thought necessary. ►) C, bmp son. Consular decretory to H*h. the High Comissioner for •Iraq.motor launches possessed by the Customs administration, although they carry an automatic gun, are not armoured, places them at a disadvantage in dealing with armed smugglers. o. A foimal request to His Majesty’s Government to assist them in suppressing smuggling on the Gulf has not so far been made by the Persian Government, and there is no special reason to suppose that such a request is likely to be made in the course of the forthcoming negotiations. Active steps, in fact, are apparently being taken by Persia to deal with the probJem in other ways, and there is reason to suppose that the Persian Government contemplate the purchase of half a dozen Italian vessels, and the engagement of an Italian Naval Officer for preventive service in the Gulf. As will be seen from what follows, the matter has, however, been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s representatives on various occasions, both by the Minister of Court and by the Belgian Customs officials. 4. The importance to Persia of the suppression of the traffic was mentioned to Sir Robert Clive by the Persian Minister of the Court at the beginning of the present year, in connection with the Persian claims to Bahrein, and Sir Robert Clive then suggested to His Majesty’s Government that it might be possible to dispose directly of the Persian claims to the island if it was possible to meet Persia in regard to the prevention of smuggling from Bahrein to the Persian coast. On the 27th January Sir Robert Clive reported an interview with the Administrator-General of Jan ' m Customs, in which M Molitor had stated that during the past year the Persian Government had been hard hit by the smuggling conducted from T ( D Koweit, Bahrein and Dabai, and that all the reports received from his jaV.’ 27 ^ 928 , P. 8 ' 79 . agents insisted that to take effective measures for the cessation of this illicit traffic British co-operation was necessary. The only practical suggestion which the Administrator-General could make, however, was that the resident British authorities in the ports mentioned “could help a great deal by having ships’ manifests inspected, and the loading of the cargoes supervised.” 5. In the light of the Minister’s representations, which assumed particular importance in view of the desirability of disposing of the question of Bahrein in direct negotiation with Persia rather than through the League of Nations, the question of possible action to assist the Persian Government was carefully investigated by the Admiralty and the Government of India. The results, however, were not such as to show that any^effective assistance could conveniently be given to Persia, the objections to action being' partly of a general political character, and partly based on grounds of practicability. 3144b 75 1028f' Adm.toF.O., Jan. 25 1928, P. 409.

On the question of action by His Majesty’s ships, the Admiralty, who drew attention to the fact that the Navy had no power to take action’ against persons infringing l eisian smuggling laws, stated that it would be contrary to the policy hitherto pursued for the Navy to take any active steps in civil operations such as the prevention of smuggling. The k only action which could, in their view, be taken without a departure fron precedent would be to report cases in which smuggling appeared to N taking place which came under the notice of His Majesty’s ships. They presumed that this would be unlikely to be of much assistance. 7. The matter was very carefully investigated by the Political Resident and by the Government of India. The result of its examination by Sir Lionel Haworth was to indicate that assistance to Persia was not merely politically undesirable, but unlikely to produce any result of value. 8. The political objections seen by the Resident, with whose views the Government of India agreed, were that assistance could be given only by applying to the Arab rulers of the Arab littoral pressure which was not justified^under the treaties between His Majesty’s Government and those potentates, vis-d-vis whom His Majesty’s Government had no sort of right to interfere; that any attempt to apply such pressure would react very adversely on the position of His Majesty’s Government on the littoral in question ; and that at a time when the consolidation of the British position in that area was more than ever important, the arguments for action of such a character in the interests of a Government which had done nothing to meet us on any-point were not convincing. 9. Apart from the general political objections set out above, the Political Resident stated that to force the rulers affected to adopt the preventive measures which would be necessary if anything was to be achieved would be difficult at Bahrein, except at considerable expense; still more difficult at Koweit; impossible at Dabai, unless the whole policy of His Majesty’s Government on the Tmcial coast was altered, and completely impracticable at El Katr (close to Bahrein), except by an increase in the British Naval force in the Gulf, after the manner adopted in the case of the arms traffic, and its employment for the purpose. As for concentrating action against Bahrein, Sir Lionel Haworth reported that smuggling took place not only from Bahrein, but from the entire length of the Arab coast, and that the success of measures against the Principality would only drive the trade to other ports, over which no effective control is exercised by His Majesty’s Government. A final objection to action on the part of His Majesty’s Government was that the greater part of the smuggling done was done from Persia in Persian ships, and not from Bahrein ; that it would be stopped to a great extent if Persia could spend money for patrolling her own coast; and that the real difficulty was that all the Persian Khans wire interested in smuggling, that the Persian Customs officials were bribed,and that the country of Tangistan was out of Persian control. 10. The Government of India, in expressing their agreement with the views of the Political Resident as set out above, add that vis-a-vis Persia “ it is not our business to control harmless exports like sugar from our Aral) Protectorates, and Persia’s apparent expectation to the contrary . . • h as &gt; as far as we know, no basis in international usage.” Summary. 11. It appears quite impracticable, in view of the difficulties set out H the Indian authorities, and the objections of principle seen by the Admiralty, for His Majesty’s Government to lend any effective assistance to Persia in dealing with the problem of smuggling. The political objections to t e application of pressure to the Arab rulers of the Gulf are very strong 111 present circumstances, and they are reinforced by the practical diffieiuties to which Sir Lionel Haworth draws attention. It is to be regretted that it is impossible to assist Persia in this matter, for an offer of help by 1 lb Majesty’s Government, if indeed it was likely to produce any effective result, might form a useful lever for bargaining purposes. But the objections to action appear to be insuperable. India Office. J. G.

It consists of correspondence between the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Kuwait, HM High Commissioner (and later Ambassador) at Baghdad, as well as communications received from Al Sabah and representatives of the Government of Iraq.The file opens with correspondence concerning the activities of Kuwaiti water boats collecting drinking water at various points along the Shatt el-Arab: the Government of Iraq complained that the boats were not stopping at designated calling points, and that the boats were engaged in smuggling, while the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for the calling point requirement to be rescinded as it was causing interruptions to the water supply. The correspondence also documents instances where Iraqi customs barges had fired on Kuwaiti boats, killing and injuring merchants.The bulk of the correspondence concerns efforts by HM Ambassador at Iraq, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent at Kuwait, to broker an agreement between the two parties. Several conferences were arranged with a view to discussing the Iraqi proposals, viz: that a British Customs Director be appointed at Kuwait to oversee the importation of certain commodities (principally sugar, tea, matches, coffee, tobacco, cigarettes, and cigarette papers); and that the Shaikh co-operate with Iraqi efforts to institute an effective frontier control and customs cordon.In addition to correspondence, the volume includes the following minutes and reports:Note by Colonel Dickson, Political Agent at Kuwait, 'the Contraband problem of Iraq with her neighbours, and in particular how it affects Kuwait', ff 600-610.Memo by Yasin Pasha on the customs position between Iraq and Kuwait, ff 565-567.Note by Colonel Dickson on the drinking water available in Kuwait and vicinity, including sketch map, ff 492-500.India Office memo 'Smuggling between Koweit and Iraq', ff 349-363.Foreign Office figures for goods smuggled from Kuwait to Iraq, ff 214-222.Private Foreign Office memo on smuggling in the Gulf region, ff 48-64.The volume includes dividers which give lists of correspondence references contained in the volume by year.
