ON the 14tli day of October, 1903y a Convention was signed in London by the Representatives of Great Britain and France providing for the settlement by abritration of certain classes of questions which might arise between the two Governments. Appendix No. I. The full text of the Convention is set out in the Appendix to this Case. On the 13th day of October, 1904, a second Agreement was signed in London by^ the Repre sentatives of Great Britain and France, referring to arbitration, in accordance with Article I of the Convention of the 14th October, 1903, certain difficulties which had arisen as to the scope of a reciprocal Declaration made on the 10th day of March, 1902, by Great Britain and France, whereby the Governments of the said Powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. The full text of the said Agreement is as follows :— '' Agreement between Great Britain and France? referring to Arlitration the Bight of certain Muscat Dhows to Hy the Trench Flag, fyc, Signed at London, October 13, 1904.

When this Treaty was concladed the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat included the August 6, 1890. territories of Zanzibar, which became an inde pendent Sultanate in 1856, and in 1890 fell under * the Protectorate of Great Britain, in virtue of arrangements made with Erance and Germany. 5. The Sultan of Muscat has also from time to time concluded Treaties of Friendship and Commerce with Great Britain. The Treaty at present in force was concluded on the 19th August, 1891, and the ratifications were exchanged at Muscat on the 20th Tebruary, 1892. The full text of the Treaty is given in the Appendix to this Case. The following Articles appear to be material to the present controversy, as affecting the application of the most-favoured-nation clause in the French Treaty of 1844: — 'ARTICLE II. ' Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, for the purposes of this Treaty, include subjects of native states in India in alliance with Her Majesty. Such subjects shall enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, throug-hout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, with respect to commerce, shipping, and the exercise of trade, as in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages, and protection of whatsoever nature, which are, or here after may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. ' They shall,' more especially, not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obliga tions of whatever description, than those to which subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. « ARTICLE XIII. / • • ' Subjects of Her BrifcanniG Majesty shall, as regards their person and property, enjoy within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat the rights of exterritoriality. 'The authorities of His Highness the Snlan have no right to interfere in disputes with subjects of Her Britannic Majesty amongst themselves or between them and members of other Christian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature, shall be decided by the competent Consular authorities. The trial and also the jmnishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accueed within [1413] , 0 t8 the dominions of His Highness the Sultan, also the hearing 1 and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly- reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan. ' Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness the Sultan or other non-Cliristian Power, not represented by Consuls at Muscat, and a subject of Her Br tannic Majesty, in which the British subject is the plaintiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan or some person specially delegated by him for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be con sidered legal unless notice has been given and an opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his sub stitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. ' ARTICLE XIV, ^ Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or any nou- Christian nation, not represented by Consuls at Muscat, who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, shall enjoy the same protection as British subjects themselves. ' Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence punishable by law, they shall, on sufficient evidence being shown to justify further proceedings, be handed over by British employers or by order of the British Consul, to the authorities of His Highness the Sultan for trial and punishment. 'AKTICLE XVI11. ' The houses, dwellings, warehouses, and other premises of Britishi subjects, or of persons actually in their regular service within the dominions of His High ness the Sultan of Muscat, shall not be entered, or searched under any pretext, by the officials of His Highness without the consent of the occupier, unless with the cognizance and assistance of the British Consul or his substitute. ,, On the lOth day of March, 1862, the following Declaration was signed in Paris by the Eepre- sentatives of Great Britain and Erance :— ' Declaration between Great Britain and France, engaging reciprocally to respect the Independence of the Sultan* of Muscat and Zanzibar, Signed at Paris, March 10, 1862.

' Appendix No. . Quaere —Is this list complete, and are these Treaties sufficiently material to justify their inclnsion in the Appendix p— W. F. CBAIBB. Besides the Treaties already mentioned, the Sultan of Muscat has entered into a series of Treaties* and Conventions with Great Britain for Treaty with Great Britain Proclamation thereon Treaty with Great Britain and Additional Articles re slave trade Arrangement with Great Britain, slave trade Letter from Sultan re search of slaves in Muscat waters by British Letter to Great Britain from Sultan of Muscat Treaty, Great Britain and Muscat Proclamation by Sultan against carriers of slaves 3 Hertslet, p. 265. 3 „ p. 269. 5 „ p. *611. 6 14 14 18 p. 578. p. 818. p. 557. p. 1115. p. 414. p. 927.10 the purpose of preventing his subjects from engag ing in the oversea Slaye Trade from Africa, and of preventing the import of African slaves into his U* Aitchison. dominions either in transit to other parts of the Naval world, or for sale in Oman By the Treaties inBtmctio hb. the Sultan has entered into definite obligations as to the measures to be undertaken within his territories and territorial waters for the sup pressing of such trade. The European Powers have for many years interested themselves in the suppression of the oversea Slave Trade from Africa to Asia, and that trade has ceased to be carried on by Euro peans, and so much of it as still remains is carried on by Asiatics or Africans in native craft. France has for many years refused to permit the exercise by warships of any other Power of any droit de visite on the high seas with regard to ships carrying the French flag. Arabs con cerned in the oversea Slave Trade (' traite des noirs ') are fully aware of this policy, and have sought to obtain the benefit of the French flag in two ways: (1) by hoisting it without authority; (2) by obtaining licence to hoist it from French Consuls in the Eastern seas, or from the authori- glave Trade ties in French Colonies or Protectorates. KeportB, 1888, o. 5578 The existence of tiiis abuse of the French flag (No. 72), to icoi. by Asiatics has been ascertained by the experience * of the naval officers engaged in suppressing the oversea Slave Trade, and the attention of the French Government has been from time to time called to the abuse of the French flag by Arab slave-traders. In 1890 a Conference of the Powers was held at Brussels for the purpose of concerting measures for the complete suppression of the African Slave mte.—TU Aet Trade, and the Conference resulted in the passing ^o^ 0 ^ 1011 ^ to t jj® of a General Act on the 2nd Jul v. 1890. Appendix, bnt a copy may be at- The General Act was ratified by France on the tached to or lodged 2nd January, 1892, subject to a provisional reser- wuh th(&gt; Case ' vation with a view to a later agreement of Articles 21, 22, 23, and 42 to 61. This partial ratification was coupled with a declaration that Articles 30-41 would be spontaneously applied by the French See 'BrusselsAct, Government in the territory of Obokh, and, ac- SedeC pp^M7. carding to necessity, in the Island of Madagascar and the Comoros. The effect of the partial ratification is to pre serve the claim of France to resist any claim to exercise on the high seas the droit de visite or to detain vessels under the French flag which are suspected of carrying slaves.11 The Sultan of Muscat is not a party to the Brussels Act, but his obligations as to suppression of the Slave Trade are defined by the Treaties already mentioned. Until the acquisition by France of the Colonies or Protectorates of Obokh and Tajourah, the Comoros and Madagascar, little opportunity arose for the obtaining of French flags and papers by the owners or skippers of Arab dhows. But when it was found that France (almost alone among the Powers) had not consented to the provisions of the Brussels Act with reference to the search and Articles XLII- detention on the high seas of vessels under her IJXI flag which were engaged in the Slave Trade, or guilty of the fraudulent use of a flag, and still maintained her objections to the visite of vessels under the French flag, the owners and skippers of native vessels who wished to engage in the Slave Trade, or from any other cause to escape surveillance on the high seas by the war ships of the Signatory Powers, immediately had recourse to French authorities to obtain French flags and papers. Per Major Cox. From the conclusion of the Treaty of 1844 until the present time very few French citizens have established themselves in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, and at the time when the differences to be settled in this arbitration arose there was in Oman only one French citizen (Gogyer) outside the Consular establishment, and one citizen of a Christian State not having a Consul at Muscat, who was treated as being under the French Consul, nor were any branches of any French commercial house/ set up in the Sultan's dominions. Consequently there were very few French citizens to take into their service any subjects of the Sultan. Notwithstanding the terms of the Treaty of 1844 and the Declaration of 1862, and the pro visions of Article XXXII of the Brussels Act of 1890, French officials in their Colonies or Protectorates of Obokh, Madagascar, and the Comoros have from time [?] granted French ships' papers, and flags to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and the same course has been taken by the French Consuls at Aden/ Muscat, f and Zanzibar.^ * The titres issued , at Aden is inclosure 4 in No. 1, Suri dhow papers. f See the titres, file, pp. 206, 208, 210, 212. J These titres form also in closures Nos. 15, 16 } 17,18 in No. 49 from India Office, August 11, 1900. [1413] D12 No. 2, Suri dhows, November 20, 1891. The bulk of the Omanis whohave thus received Prench papers belong to the district of Jalaniand town of Sur, within the territories and subject to the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. The seafaring men among this population leave Sur with their vessels and voyage to India and Africa, returning at the end of the season and laying up their ships at Sur. Many of the owners of the vessels, having grown old and affluent, are content to send their vessels out under captains, and do not, themselves, leave Sur. Many of these Suris Cox. had been, and some still are, engaged in the over sea Slave Trade. In Tebruary 1891 the Prench Consul at the British port of Aden granted French papers and flags to eight captains or owners who were subjects of the Sultan of Muscat and resident at Sur. Appendix No. I, Sun dhow papers. The fact was reported to the British Government, Eibot, November 20 1891 and remonstrances were addressed to the French ' Government, in reply to which M. Eibot, then Prench Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the 20th November, 1891, stated that the grant had been Appendix No. , , , i p n x i. i Ribot to Lytton, made in error, and that he would not tail to taKe inoiosnre 3 in the steps necessary to prevent its recurrence. This statement, made before the qualified and partial ratification by France of the Brussels Act of 1890, was understood by Great Britain to mean that France would no longer, grant to Omani Arabs the use of French flags, or titres de navigation. Notwithstanding this statement, the French Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, , . . -i -n i Suri dhow papers; authorities at Obokh in 1892 granted French a i s0 n i Q No. i. papers to dhows whose owners and crews were Suris, and the French Consul at Aden referred to the authorities at Obokh dhow owners who applied to him at Aden for French papers. The Sultan of Muscat has never admitted that this grant of French flags or papers is warranted by Treaty or usage, nor that the French authori ties are entitled to make themselves judges or protectors of any of his subjects who are not actually and lond fide in the service of French subjects in his dominions. He expressed his objections so far back as 1891, and in that year Muhammad -bin-Mubarak-bin-Salim, his Wali at Sur, ordered the skippers to cancel their certi ficates and return them to the French, and this May 13,1893, order seems in some cases to have been obeyed, p ' ^ 011 file ' In March 1891 the Sultan furnished the British Inclosnre 9 in Government with a list of thirteen captains of papers, and see Suri boats carrying French colours. mlvoh u/mi.i 13 Durand to Mockler, August 11,1891.

And the Sultan in that year took counsel with the British Government as to the use of Trench flags by his subjects, and was advised that the use of the Trench flag could have no effect as against him, and that he had full authority to punish any of his subjects who might infringe the laws of his country, whatever flag or papers they might have accepted. In June 1892 the British Government received information that Trench papers had been granted at Obokh to five large buggalows, all heavily armed and owned and manned by Suris, and made representations to the Trench Government with respect to these vessels asking for a searching inquiry. This inquiry was made, and in April 1893 M. Dorvelle, then Minister of Toreign Affairs, stated, as the result, that the owners, patrons, or proprietors had declared that they wished to settle in Jibuti, and had obtained con cessions of land. The Minister, though expressing himself satisfied with the result of the inquiry, stated that instructions had been given to take the greatest care in verifying the papers of such vessels and in dealing with offences. It is further to be noted that the Consuls at Muscat and Zanzibar have, notwithstanding M. Ribot's admission of error with respect to Aden, have granted Trench papers in cases where even the formalities required in Trench Colonies could not be complied with, and it is particularly to be observed that certain of the Utres de navigation emanating from those places omit statement of the residence and status of the owner of the vessel, and permit the employment of a foreign crew. Notwithstanding the objections and representa tions above stated, from 1892 until the present time, the authorities in the Trench Colonies and Protectorates of Obokh, Madagascar, and Comoro have made a constant practice of granting Trench flags and ships' papers to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, natives of and residing in his dominions chiefly in Sur. The applicants for the flag and papers arenot naturalized nor Trench citizens, and have no authority from their Sultan to change their allegiance, nor do they settle in Trench territory, nor pay more than fleeting visits thereto for the purpose of renewing their licences. Some of them go through the form of buying a house, or depositing what is considered the value of a house in the Colony or Protectorate. But14 the whole transaction is colourable and fraudulent, and the Prench Colonial authorities are deceived by the machinations of these Arabs, and are thereby induced to grant licences to such persons in a manner inconsistent with Articles XXX to LXI of the Brussels Act, and not warranted, by the municipal law of France or the Colonies as to the issue of ships' papers or the grant to ships of the French flag, and also in a manner inconsistent with international law and comity. Subjects of the Sultan resident in his dominions who have obtained French flags and papers in the illegal and fraudulent manner above described have used the flag and papers for the purpose of the Slave Trade. Many reports have been received from British naval ofiicers in the Indian Seas and from the British residents in Oman and on the Persian Gulf which establish this fact. Moreover, on returning to the waters and territory of Muscat these men have claimed— (1) That the Sultan is not entitled to board or search their vessels, or to exercise any jurisdiction over them; (2) That they are not subject to the Sultan's authority while in his territory, but are entitled to be treated as proteges of France and to be exempt from his laws as to customs, quarantine, and other matters. In these contentions they have been on several occasions supported by the French Consul in Muscat and by the French Government. In 1894 as many as twenty-three dhows, hailing from Sur, and owned and manned by Suris, appear to have possessed French papers. A list of these vessels, given in No. in the Appendix, was communicated to the French Government on the 9th February, 1895, with a request for an investigation with a view to ascertaining whether the vessels were really registered. In consequence of this despatch, a French war ship, the ' Troude,' went to Sur to verify the papers of any dhow flying the French flag. The results of this inquiry were not communicated to the Sultan of Muscat or the British Government, but the Commander of the vessel was understood by the British Agent at Muscat to state that the practice of granting to Suri dhows the French flag and papers at Obokh had been stopped. On the 28th J une, 1895, this statement was brought to the attention of the French Govern- v January 20, 1898, Fagan. See September 26, 1894 ; June 18, 1900.

At first it was passed over sub silentio, but ultimately, in reply to a further inquiry, the Prench Minister in London, on the 16th March, 1897, informed Lord Salisbury that there had been a misapprehension, and that there was no intention of discontinuing the practice, and in May 1897 the British Govern ment received a Report from the Sultan of Muscat, through the British Agent there, that French papers were being obtained by Suri dhows at the French Consulate in Zanzibar, then a British Protectorate, and on the 4th May, 1897, Commander Hoskyns, of His Majesty's ship, ' Blonde,' which was cruising on the Zanzibar coast for the repression of the Slave Trade, reported that thirty-eight dhows had changed from Muscat to Erench nationality at the Erench Consulate at &gt; Zanzibar, and had obtained permission to carry passengers. In May of that year the Sultan of Muscat had addressed to M. Ottavi, the Erench Consul in Muscat, a protest against the grant by the Erench authorities in Aden and Africa of Erench flags to Omanis. To the protest the Consul replied by the unfounded statement that the practice had existed for forty years, and had been accepted by the Sultan. Eurther correspondence ensued, the Sultan pressing his protest and the Erench Consul main taining his contention that only Erench officers could interfere with dhows carrying Erench ' Sphinx.' I am disposed to think that the ' Sphinx ' dhows had better be kept for the Counter- January 20,1898. The titre referred to is exhibited there. In 1896 His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' stopped three dhows at sea near the Oman coast at a point supposed, at the date of seizure, to be on the hi^h seas, but afterwards ascertained to be within O ' the territorial waters of Oman. On one the papers were found in order. The other two contained slaves, and were seized and brought into port, and, after a claim by the Erench Consul, were handed over to him, and the captains were ultimately tried at Beunion and convicted of slave-trading. One of these dhows, the ' Salama,' was captained by Abdullah'bin-Mohammed Baluch,an inhabitant of Abu Abal's, on the Batineh coast, 50 miles from Muscat and in the territory of the Sultan. The vessel was owned by Hamed-bin-Abdullah Baluch, of the same place. The Erench titre de navigation was issued at Zanzibar and describes this Ahmed-bin-Abdullah as residing at Majunga, and the licence was to ply on the coasts of Madagascar *16 and adjoining islands, and to have a foreign crew. It was issued at Zanzibar. In 1899 the Sultan wrote to the then French Consul at Muscat informing him that he did not p^s, 0 ^m'yfiie recognize the right of France to exercise juris- 0xact text waQted - diction over bis subjects residing in or visiting bis dominions, whether they were in possession of French papers or not, and that the practice of granting French protection to his subjects at Sur was contrary to the Declaration of 1862 {ante, p. ), and at the same time he also wrote to the head of the Jennibeh tribe at Sur recommending them to return their French flags, and adopt the original red Arab flag. Following up the policy indicated by the Declaration of 1899, the Sultan, in June 1900, paid ^*6 in IHle? 9 *' a visit to Sur, and there conferred with the chief p. 51. men of Sur and those of his subjects there who held French flags and papers.

No. D describes the owner as resident in a place somewhat illegibly written, but appearing to be Mitsa Mixxonte, declared by the owner to be the name of one of the Comoro Islands, His actual residence was at Suweik, a small port on the Batineh coast of Oman. It is further to be observed that these titres were all granted or renewed by French Consuls at Muscat or Zanzibar, and not by the officers of ^French Colonies or Protectorates; and it is also to be noted that the titre permits the employ ment of a foreign crew, which militates against any contention that the crew can be considered as Erench proteges. At the time of the Sultan's visit to Sur all the Suri vessels except one were laid up in harbour for the monsoon season, and though at least those owned by the persons in the list given iu the Appendix No. claimed to sail under the French flag, only fifteen or sixteen had on them any names or numbers as required by Article XXXIV of the Brussels Act, and on even these vessels the names were not inlaid as required, but so dis- possed on the quarter that they could be easily removed or erased. The French titres above referred to were sent by the Sultan to M. Ofctavi, who declined to receive them, and visited Sur to inquire into the circumstances attending their surrender, and the French authorities have since that date continu ally questioned the correctness of the Sultan's action so far as it relates to French papers grant ed to his subjects before the date of his visit to Sur. On the 26th June, 1900, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, gave to the British Minister of Foreign Affairs an assurance that no certificates would be recognized which had been granted for the first time to subjects of the Sultan after that date, and t^hat the existing papers would be carefully examined. The Naval Commander sent for this purpose on the tc Dr6me' would seem to have directed his attention mainly to intimidating the Sultan into returning to the dhow owners the titres already surrendered, and a similar policy seems to have been followed by the Commander of the 'Catinat', which visited Sur in December 1900. On the 11th February, 1902, by the direction of the British Government, the British Consul at18 Muscat addressed to M. Laronee, then French Consul there, a protest against the assertion ot* any claim by France &lt;e to exercise jurisdiction in Muscat territory and territorial waters over certain horn and domiciled Omani subjects of His Highness, to wnom French flags and titvcs de navigcijtiou had been issued ' by officials of the French Government. This protest was evoked by official communica tions made by the French Consul on the 14th and 23rd January, 1902, in which he claimed to exercise jurisdiction over certain Omanis on the strength of their possessing French flags and papers. Nog . The text of the correspondence is given in the Febrnary 11 ,1902 Appendix. Febraary 14, 1902 In the final letter the French Consul wrote— «Ni moini le Cotamandanfc Kiesel n'ayons I'mtentbn de soumettre des sujets de rOman k la juridiction file, p. iblc. TVanCaise : nous revendiqunos seulement le droit que nous confere I'Acte de Bruxelles, c'est-a-dire un droit de surveillance et de police sur les boutriers qui portent notre pavilion.' Upon this statement it is necessary to observe that the Consul places reliance, not upon the Treaty of 1844, upon which his jurisdiction over Omani subjects, so far as it exists, depends, but upon t^Q Act of Brussels, as conferring aright of surveillance and police in the waters and territo ries of another Power which is not a party to that Act. And it will be seen on reference to the Brussels Act that Article XLII especially reserves the national jurisdiction in the territorial waters of every State. As the result of the inquiries and investigations made by the Agents of the French Government, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, Appendix, Nov on the 14th August, 1901, presented a Memo randum expressing the views of the French Government on the question. This was sent to the British Consul at Muscat for report, and the substance of his Report was embodied in a Memorandum handed by Lord Lansdowne to Appendix. No. M. Cambon on the 16th April, 1902. At the fi 51 interview which then took place, it was agreed to File p 109 treat what had passed as personal as to changes of view between the French Ambassador and the p. xoe. British Foreign Minister, and M. Cambon stated that there was no desire to interfere in any way with the Sultan of Muscat, and that his only wishv Shooting at French flag, Sur.

From that date for a time the controversy rested. But in the year 1903 two events happened which ultimately revived the controversy and conduced to the present arbitration. Abdulla-bin-Salem, Chief of the Gafiri Arabs, resident at Sur, was engaged in a tribal war with a section of another Arab tribe. Pinding that his opponents were receiving supplies through Sur, the Chief levied a fine on the town, and forbade native vessels to leave until the Headmen had paid the fine. Mubarak-bln-Hamed Eazaiki owned a dhow, for which he had taken out papers in the name of his son, Khamis-bin-Mubarak, and flew the French flag. Both he and his son were residents in Sur, and subjects of the Sultan. To avoid his tribal liability, Mubarak expressed his intention of taking his ship out, and on his persisting, some of Abdulla-bin-Salem's men fired on the vessel, and a shot went through the flag. This incident was made the ground of a claim by the French Consul on the Sultan-for an indemnity of 1,500 dols. The claim was chal lenged by the British Consul, and was withdrawn or postponed. On the 8th April, 1903, the British mail steamer ' Chindwara,' from Bombay, arrived off Muscat, having on board, among other passengers, five Arabs, all natives of and residents at Sur. Their names were :— 1. Saeed-hin-Muharak-hm-RasUd, of the Faris section of the Jennebeh tribe. 2. Mosallim-hin-Sultan, of the Mukanna section of the same tribe. 3. Ahdulla-Un-Khamis-hin-AU, of the same sec tion of the same tribe. 4). Salem-hiwAhdulla-hm-Khamis, son of No. 3. 5. Khalfan-UnSamed-hin-Muhammed Wad Belan, of the same section of the same tribe. Bombay being an infected port, the ship was subjected to the quarantine laws of the Sultan of Muscat. Nos. 1 and 2, who were deck passengers, on landing were sent to Haramah, the Sultan s quarantine station, about 3 miles from Muscat. Nos. 3, 4, and 5, who were second-class passen- F20 gers, were not sent to the quarantine station, but were allowed by the Sultan's Health Officer to go on shore, under orders to report daily at the hospital for one week for medical inspection. No. 4 offered money to Ali Salmar, the Sultan's Quarantine Superintendent, not to send Nos. 1 and 2 to the quarantine station. On the 9th April, Nos. 3, 4, and 5 came to the hospital, and, after medical inspection, said : &lt;f We want to go away to-day,'* but Ali Salmar said to them : ' It is impossible; wait and see if the doctor will let you go a day or two before the time.' On the same evening these three men hired a badan, and sailed away in it without leave at dusk in company with Khamis-bin Mubarak Razeiki and two askaris, besides the master and crew. The vessel did not fly the Trench flag, and belonged to Taiwi, a port in Oman, between Muscat and Sur. About 8 p.m. Nos. 1 and 2 escaped from the quarantine station, and joined the badan at Bunder Jisseh, seven miles from Muscat, on the morning of the 10th April. Their escape was reported by the Superintendent of the quarantine station, and led to the discovery that Nos. 3, 4, and 5 had also escaped. The Sultan, on learning of the breach of quaran tine, communicated with his Health Officer and with Major Cox, the British Eesident, and the latter on the joint request of the Sultan and his Health Officer (the Sultan at that date notjhaving any steam-vessel of his own), applied to the Captain of His Majesty's ship ' Perseus' for the use of a steam-launch to pursue the badan. The launch travelled down the coast with the Super intendent of the quarantine station on board, and ultimately sighted the badan near Has AbuDaud. The vessel ran ashore, and the five Arabs were arrested on the shore and taken back to Muscat. The crew and the other passengers on the badan were not interfered with. On the arrival of the five Arabs at Muscat, they were taken before the Health Officer, who resides at the British Consulate, and at the request of the Sultan were detained in the guard room of the Consulate during the night of the 10th April, and on the 11th April the Sultan wrote to Major Cox thanking him for the capture of the Arabs, and asking for their further detention at the Consulate. On the same day they were handed over to Officers of the Sultan and taken back to the quarantine, station to complete their21 ' Persia and Arabia. '* May 16, Section 1, inclosure 7 in No. 1.

Before their departure, Major Cox, at the written request of the Sultan, had taken the statement of all five Arabs. On the same day the Prench Consul, M. Dor- ville, wrote to Major C ox complaining of the imprisonment hy him of three French prot^s who had contravened the Quarantine Regulations. Major Cox replied that five Suri subjects of the Sultan had broken quarantine, and that M. Dor- ville should address himself to their Sovereign. M. Dorville, on the same day, claimed from the Sultan release of three of these Arabs (Nos. 3, 4, and 5) as being Suris under French protection. The Sultan replied on the 12th April, stating his intention to punish the five Arabs for breaking quarantine, and repeating his protest against the contention that the French flag covered any of his subjects while on his territory or territorial waters and saying that he would be content to have the question settled by discussion and decision oO Great Britain and France. On the 15th April the Sultan tried the five Arabs for breaking quarantine and sentenced them to three months' imprisonment. The Sultan's action was challenged by the French Consul and the Commander of the French war-ship ' Infernet', and supported by the British Government; and after discussion between the British and the French Governments, the questions raised by the incident were ultimately referred to the arbitrament of the Tribunal by the Compromis printed at p. of this Case. On the 11th April, 1903, the Sultan of Muscat requested M. Dorville, then French Consul at Muscat, to furnish him with a list of the names of those persons whom the French Government claimed to protect in the Saltan's territories, explaining in each case upon what the right of the individuals to be considered under French protection was based. This request was refused, but on the 13th May, 1903, at an interview with Lord Lansdowne, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, said that the French Government had been quite ready to fall in with the British suggestion to the effect that a list of persons possessing French flags should be pre- pared, and that such a list had, in fact, been made out and would have been delivered to the ' Sultan when the quarantine incident arose. Up to the date of the filing of this Case such lists have not been delivered, and the British22 Government reserves its rights as to examin ing and verifying them. The delivery of such lists would enable His Highness the Sultan to cox to India obtain an examination and written explanation of Marchs 8 ^ the grounds on which each titre de navigation or 1902, iciu. flag was given, and to indicate to the Prench Government the cases in which its officers had been induced, by misstatements as to the nation ality and real domicile of the flagholder, to grant such titres and flags to subjects of the Sultan who had no title to become French proteges.23 ARGUMENT. Law Officers, August 4,1898. 30 in 216, p. 257, Indian view, Article XLII, Brussels Act, saviug. Foreign Office, August 4, 1898. The facts above stated indicate the acts by French officials which form the ground of com plaint by the Sultan and the British Government. It remains to consider their juridical quality. The Sultan of Muscat, like every other inde pendent Sovereign, is entitled to police his own waters for the enforcement of his own laws and to secure compliance with his Treaties with foreign Powers, and this sovereign right includes that of enforcing Quarantine Regulations and suppressing the Slave Trade; and, in the absence of special Conventions, no foreign Power is entitled to exercise any police powers at all in the Sultan's waters ; and the Sultan is further, as an independent Sovereign, entitled to exercise full jurisdiction over all persons within his terri tory, except so far as by Treaty, usage, or sufferance he has conceded to a foreign State the privilege of exterritoriality for its subjects or for persons whom he recognizes as proteges of such foreign Power, Among Christian Powers the privilege of ex territoriality is conceded only in favour of the Heads of foreign States, persons of the Corps Diplomatique, and the members of their family or household, and foreign public vessels. In the case of Oriental Powers in Asia and Africa, capitulations and Treaties have been made with Christian Powers, admitting within the ter ritories of such Oriental Powers a special Con sular jurisdiction over subjects of the Christian Power there resident, and, de titre gracieux, over subjects of other Christian Powers which have no Consuls in the Oriental State, and also to a qualified and varying extent over the subjects of the Oriental Power in the service of subjects of such Christian Power. The history of the privileges of the latter class has to a very great extent been a history of their abuse, and in the Ottoman Empire—the most considerable of the Mussulman States— the rights of a Christian Power to take Otto man subjects under its protection were narrowly restricted by Regulations of 1863 and 1865, fully accepted by Christian Powers as consti tuting the reasonable limits for such protection ;24 and the concurrence of the chief Powers of Europe in this view is fully expressed in Article IX of the Treaty of Peace between Turkey and ?h te J , ® pers ' * * ^ Vol. XC, p. 427. Greece of the 22nd November (4jth December), 1897, and in the Award made on the 21st March, Memorial 1901, with respect to the subiect of protection bv Diplomatique, n • tu rm -o • 1901 j pp. 279,298. Greece m the Ottoman Empire. The rights of Prance in Muscat, as defined by the Treaty of 1844, are limited to the protection of French citizens there, and of Omani subjects, who are actually in the service of such French citizens, and do not confer on the Consuls of France any jurisdiction over any subject of the Sultan who is not actually and bond fide in French service in Muscat. [The Sultan of Muscat has always been prepa red to accept French jurisdiction as attaching to subjects of a Christian Power not having a Consul at Muscat, who have registered themselves at the French Consulate there, and] by reading the most-favoured-nation clause of the Treaty of 1844 with the terms of the British Treaty 1891, France may be considered as entitled to include among her proteges in Muscat— 1. Natives of places in Africa or the Indian Seas which are French Protectorates, provided that such natives were subjects of the protected States at the time when the Protectorate was established, and were domiciled in these States. [2. Subjects of non-Christian Powers, not having a Consulate in Muscat, who are actually in the service of French citizens in Muscat.] To the extent above stated, and nofurther, do the Treaties derogate from the recognized rule of international law that one State is not entitled to extend its protection over the subjects of another, except— 1. In its own territories. 2. Elsewhere, with the assent of the Sovereign of the protected person. The Muscat Treaty of 1844 contains no sur render of the Sultan's right of police over his waters, and grants no right to France to exercise widdingtoi, that police. The only privilege with respect to mTp. 1 !.' 1891 ' French vessels is that contained in Article X of the Treaty, which accords them the treatment of the most favoured nation in the ports of Muscat, and the terms of this concession do not involve the right to break the Sultan's Quarantine Begulations or to carry, on the Slave Trade in the Sultan's territory or territorial waters. Foreign Office, August 4, 1898.25 The qualified exterritoriality granted by the Treaty is a concession to the difference between Western and Eastern conceptions of law and justice, and is not in any way intended to enable France to interfere between the Sultan and his own subjects in any case not specifically provided for in the Treaty. And the text of the Treaty has not been supplemented, varied, or enlarged in this respect by any recognized or established usage, permit ting France to exercise either concurrent or exclusive jurisdiction over the Sultan's subjects in his territories or in his territorial waters. On the 19th May, 1903, the French Ambassador in London stated ' that the Treaty^ of 1844 was not designed to meet the case of those owners of dhows whose rights, he said, were in many cases anterior to the date of the Treaty; that the French flagholders were altogether outside the Treaty, and that protection was claimed for them not under the Treaty, but because they had been given French papers and were entitled to fly the French flag.' It is difficult to comprehend the principle upon which such a claim could be based. It involves an assertion of the right of France spontaneously to create as many proteges as it chooses in Muscat by grant of French papers and flags to any foreigner who applies for them, and as it admittedly does not rest on any specific Treaty with Muscat, the claim is equally applicable to the subjects of any European Power in the territories of their natural Sovereign—a conten tion which no civilised State would for a single moment admit. In truth the contention seems to be based on a confusion of ideas and a mistaken notion that Christian Powers are entitled in Oriental States to create classes of protected Orientals without reference to any Treaty or capitulation, and to force on the Eulers of those States, with respect to their own subjects, the municipal laws of France. It is not admissible in the case of Muscat to base any claim to French protection on the fact that the protege has acquired a domicile on French territory, which is not the equivalent of nation ality, or that, either in good or bad faith, he has acquired immeuhles in a French Colony or Protectorate. The maritime laws of France appear not to con template the grant of French papers to- vessels26 unless at least half the vessel is owned by French citizens. And Article XXXII of the Brussels Act cannot be interpreted as extending or giving any wider scope to these laws. That Article recognizes the principle that it would be an abuse to grant the national flag indiscriminately to native vessels, and operates to restrict internationally the right of Powers which have accepted it to cover by their flag native craft in the Indian Seas, and is Foreign Offioe to obviously aimed at preventing the very mischief 8*i e 902. OVember created by the practices detailed on pp. of this jg v ^Q| pteinber Case. In other words, the aim of the Article was to insure that no native vessel should fly the flag of a Signatory Power unless it satisfied the conditions laid down in the Article, and that native vessels which were not, by reason of the status of their owners as actual subjects or bond fide proteges of a Signatory Power, should have to resort to the flag of any of the native States to which their owners belonged. The effect of the action of French officials has been to enable Arabs of independ ent States or tribes not belonging to any French Colony or Protectorate to wrap them selves in the tricolour, and thereby to claim the right to escape on the high seas from search under Article XLII of the Brussels Act, and in the waters, or in the territory, of the State to which they belonged, notwithstanding the saving clause in that Article, to claim exterritoriality and independence of their own lawful Sovereign, and to defeat his efforts to enforce his own laws and Treaty obligations to suppress their nefarious occupation. The saving clause in Article XLII of the Brussels Act expresses the universally established rule of international law as to the jurisdiction of a State within its own territorial waters. It is idle to contend that France, by reserving her assent to the Article, has given herself larger powers of police and surveillance in the waters of other States than would be acquired by those Powers which have accepted Article XLII, and it is to be further noted that Muscat not being a party to the Brussels Act, France cannot, by virtue of these Articles of the Act which she has accepted, claim the exercise of any rights in the dominions or territorial waters of the Sultan, whose obligations, always fully recognized to suppress the Slave Trade, are defined by the Treaties with Great Britian already referred to, Appendix, and not by the Brussels Act.j See Wheaton and Atlay. 1904, p. 171, citing R. v. Anderson, L. R. K. C. R. 161, and R. «. Dadlej, 14 Q. B. D., 273. jt- J 7 ■ f f '^v &gt; £ 27 The terms of the second paragraph of Article XXXII of the Act are inconsistent with the prac tice of granting permits at Trench Consulates in foreign States because the proof of possession of immeubles there referred to clearly relates to immeubles within the territory and jurisdiction of the French authority granting the permits which cannot exisc in foreign States in which the French only have Consulate?. Assuming, for the purposes of the present case, that by the grant of French papers to the Omani owner of an Arab dhow the vessel and the recipient of the papers acquire privileges and incur obligations within French waters and on the high seas, those rights depend solely on French municipal law, and so soon as the vessel and its owner and crew return within the territorial waters of Muscat there is nothing in the recognised rules of international law or in Treaties already quoted which renders the vessel, its owner or crew, entitled to privileges as a French vessel. Where the title of the Omani owner to fly the French flag is questioned by his Sultan, it is not enough for a French official to assert that the man is a prot^g^, or to show th^t he or his ship is registered at the Consulate or has French papers. The claim to privilege must be warranted by the facts and brought within the relevant Treaty. The papers of many of these vessels contain a clause permitting the vessel to be manned by foreigners, which has the effect of displacing any presumption which might otherwise have arisen that the crew of such a vessel under the French flag were Frenchmen, and of making it necessary in each case to show that members of the Crew were, iudependently of the titre, either French men or natives of French Colonies or Protectorates, or in the service of Frenchmen. Great respect is, of course, due to the declara tion of a responsible officer of France with respect to persons claimed at French protegds. But subjects of Oman who claim such a privilege or exemption must prove that they are entitled to it under some Treaty, and when the facts of their birth, nationality, residence, and occupation are perfectly well established, it is impossible that such facts can be countervailed by a declaration that they are registered in the French Consulate or have obtained French papers while outside Oman. The only result of such a declaration is to28 entitle the Sultan to invite France immediately to investigate the circumstanoes under which her officials have permitted unqualified persons to obtain the semblance of being French citizeas or prot(5g^s, and to have the claimants at once struck off any Consular register on which they appear, and deprived of any French flags or papers which they have wrongfully obtained. It is possible that some confusion may have been caused on this subject by reference to diplomatic communities. When diplomatic exemption from territorial law is claimed, the declaration of the accredited State is in most, if not all, cases conclusive of the quality of the person, of which it has the best means of know ledge, and the only remaining question is whether the Embassy has been accepted by the State to which it is accredited. In the case of a claim by a native of a country to be a protege of a foreign Power, otherwise than by virtue of service to a diplomatic officer, the natural presumption is against such privilege, and the officers of the protecting State, while they may be able to say that they have regis tered the claimant or done acts purporting to give him protection, must go further, and show in what quality and under what Treaty or principle of international law the claim can be justified. To admit the absolute right of a foreign State to conclude by its declaration the question whether any person was, or was not, its protege, would enable it to transfer to its pro tection masses of a foreign population residing in their own country, and to create semi-independent communities within the borders of a friendly State. Indeed, this is precisely what has resulted at Sur from the action of French officials in Muscat, and constitutes a grave attack upon the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. And, even assuming a limited jurisdiction in the French Consul to decide questions arising between the captain and crew of an Omani vessel flying the French flag, this jurisdiction does not render either captain or crew French proteges so as to withdraw them from the justice of their Sovereign in matters not relating to the contract of sea service. The same rule is applicable as in the case of a foreign merchant ship in the waters of any European State. The crew are justiciable in such State for anything there done (with the possible exception of the matters arising out of their contract of sea service), and if one of the1 — —'—' i 29 crew is a subject of the State where the ship lies, its fla» does not alter his nationality nor his consequent liability to the laws of his natural Sovereign. If a French criminal were found among the crew of a foreign merchant-ship in a Erench port, the jurisdiction of the Prench authorities to arrest and try him would be internationally indis putable. There is also a further risk of confusion from the somewhat equivocal meaning of the word ' prot^g^.'* During the many controversies which have arisen as to prot^g^s in the Mediterranean, there was until recent years, no question of Pro tectorates in the modern sense of that term. European Powers in the Levant protected many non-subjects, but this exercise of protection rested on arrangement with the Porte, and not Had it absorbed on an y territorial Protectorate. At the time of the AigwiaP—Yes, in Treaty with Muscat Prance had no territorial Protectorates, and the policy of Protectorates is of modern origin, not receiving international acceptance until the Berlin Act. Since 1880, Prance has acquired many Protectorates and spheres of influence in Africa, The status of occupants of such territories has not yet been settled by international consensus. But inas much as the existence of a Protectorate puts the foreign relations of the protected States into the hands of France, it is easy to admit that subjects of the potentates who have admitted a Protec torate should, in foreign countries, be given the position of French citizens, although they may not acquire full civic rights in France itself. But it does not follow from this concession that natives of other countries who resided in the Protectorates when established as natives of the Protectorate who had ceased to reside in them before the establishment are in any way brought under allegiance to France or acquire any title to protection by France as against their natural Sovereign or the Sovereign of the State in which they have settled. Still less does it follow that, because a foreigner chooses to go into a French Colony or Protec torate and build a house or declare that he shall domicile there, France may at once naturalize him without the assent of his Sovereign or on the strength of his domicile give him papers consti tuting him a French protege in his own native country. A foreign settler in a Protectorate is 1837. See Hertslet, Africa bj Treaty, 287. y30 entitled to the protection of French laws while there, but not to carry French laws back with him to his native country when he chooses to return thither, and the test of protection by domicile is peculiarly inappropriate to Mussulman sailors, who, to the ordinary proclivities of sea faring men, add the polygamous habits of their faith, and may have a residence and a lawful wife at every port which they frequent during the sailing season, while they return to their native country and real domicile during that period of the year in which it is unsafe or unusual to ply their occupation. The case of the quarantine-breakers—which is the latest—is also the boldest instance of the Trench claim. The men did not arrive at Muscat under the French flag, and did not run away from their quarantine in a vessel flying the French flag. Tae sole ground of the privilege claimed was that they had at some time sailed in such a vessel or obtained French papers in connection with such a vessel. They were confessedly Suri subjects of the Sultan resident in his dominions. A claim by the subject of a European Power to defy the Quarantine Eegulations of his own State on the ground that he owned, or had sailed in, a ship registered in France would at once be scouted as inconsistent with every principle alike of municipal and international law, and in the absence of a Treaty with Muscat specifically varying the ordinary rules of jurisdiction, the claim put forward by France has no juridical substance.

(8469.) MUSCAT DHOWS ARBITRATION. IN THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION AT THE HAGrUE. GRAKT OF THE FRENCH FLAG TO MUSCAT DHOWS. ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE OOVERMIEKT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY. LONDON; PBIKTED AT THE FOREIGK OFFICE, BY HAKRISON AND SONS, PRINTERS IN ORDINARY TO HIS MAJESTY.MUSCAT DHOWS ARBITRATION. ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OP THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY. PREFACE. THE Tribunal is now in possession of the Cases and Counter-Cases containing the state ments of the Parties to the present controversy, and of the facts and documents upon which the Parties base their respective contentions. The object of the present Argument will be to lay before the Tribunal, as briefly as is consistent with clearness, what in the view of His Majesty's Government are the proper conclusions to be drawn, with respect to the matter included in the ' Compromis,' from the statements and documents submitted, and to indicate the irrelevancy, for the solution of the questions in controversy, of a very great portion of the contents of the French ' Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire.' It is to be observed at the outset that France, by adopting the role of defendant in a case in which she is claiming immunity and exceptional treatment for Arabs in the dominions of their natural Sovereign, has reserved for the ' Contre- Memoire ' a great part of her own affirmative case, and that the ' Contre-M^moire,' like the ' Memoire,' is very largely taken up by state ments with reference to Great Britain which have nothing to do with the points in dispute,, and serve only to distract the attention of the Arbi trators from the points really at issue. It appears to His Majesty's Government that the relevant matters of fact involved in the Case fall within a very small compass, and that for the solution of questions mainly, if not solely, of a juridical character, it is unnecessary and im proper to enter into speculations or to make allegations as to the diplomatic action or political situation of either of the two Governments con cerned. His Majesty's Government submit that [733] B 22 France does not assist lier case by the manner in which motives are imputed to Great Britain or to the British anthorities in India (' Contre- M&amp;moire,' p. 51). His Majesty's Government do not propose to recriminate by any inquiry into the policy of France with respect to the coast of Arabia, and are content to examine the acts and claims of France with respect to the Treaty of 1844, the Declaration of 1862, and the Brussels Act of 1890, by reference to the con- veptional rights and duties arising from these documents and to the rules of international law. They will confine themselves to the task of laying before the Tribunal what would appear, according to international law and the terms of those docu ments, to be the due appreciation of the correct ness and effect of these claims. It is stated in the Preface to the French ' Contre-Mdmoire' (p. 1) that the French ' Memoire '— 'a d^montre enfin que la France n'a jamais cessd dans ses rapports avec I'lmanat d'observer I'esprit, comnie la lettre, de la Declaration du 10 Mars, 1862. Cette derni^re question est en rdalit^ la seule qui devait etre soumise au present arbitrage.' It has already been pointed out in the British Counter-Case (p. 2) that the 'Compromis' sub mits to the Tribunal no such general question as above stated. On perusal of the terms of British Case, p. 2. the ' Compromis' and of M. Cambon's letter printed at p. 80 of the French ' Contre- Memoire,' it will [be clearly seen that no general inquiry is intended as to whether Great Britain or France have respected the mutual Declaration of 1862, but a particular inquiry as to whether the grant by France of her flag to subjects of the Sultan is consistent with the Declaration, and as a necessary incident of such inquiry, to ascertain what immunities France claims to attach, within the Sultanate of Muscat, to the possession of the French flag by the Sultan's subjects. In view of the too frequent digressions from the true issue in the French ' Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire,' His Majesty's Government cannot refrain from pressing urgently on the Tribunal the true nature of the issues submitted and the desirability of confining the arguments and conclusions to these issues.PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. Before passing to the facts and arguments, it is unfortunately again necessary to dispose of certain preliminary allegations which, appear to impugn the good faith of Great Britain. The ' Contre-Memoire ' (pp. 3 to 7) deals with the question of the appearance of the name His Highness the Sultan as a party to the British Case, In the British Counter-Case (p. 1) Great Britain has, in deference to French wishes, deleted the Sultan's name as a party. But it has been pointed out in the Counter-Case (p. 1) and in the correspondence (printed at pp. 39, 40, and 41 of the Counter-Case) that the French objection is purely technical, and that His Highness has, in fact, invoked the good offices of Great Britain. The position assumed by Great Britain, and objected to by France, is not that of legal guardian of the Sultan, but of a friendly Power selected and requested to lay before the Tribunal the Sultan's experience of the effect on his authority of the action of France with respect to his subjects. His Majesty's Government are confident that, on perusal of these documents, the Tribunal will be satisfied of the correctness of the attitude assumed by Great Britain, and that the statement made on p. 4 of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' as to the tardiness of the Sultan's assent is erroneous, and that his assent was given so far back as 1903. Whether the Sultan is or is not formally a party to the arbitration, it is essential for the Tribunal to determine the extent to which France is entitled to confer immunity on the Sultan's subjects from the jurisdiction of their natural Sovereign within his own territory. ' Oontre- It is suggested in the French 'Contre-Memoire' Memoire,' p. 3. that the British Case is, both in substance and in form, incompatible with the Declaration of 1862. It is difficult to see how such a contention can seriously be advanced. To admit its accuracy would be to read the Declaration as precluding Great Britain from ever questioning the propriety of any act done by France as to Oman. If the Sultan happens to agree with one of the two Parties to the Declaration of 1862 that the other is attacking his independence, is it to be said that mmm4 to support tlie Sultan in his opinion is to violate his independence ? If, finding tliat his jurisdiction over his subjects is impaired by the action of one of the two Powers, he consults the other, is the giving of advice on such consultation a breach of his independence ? May he only consult the country against which he feels that he has ground for complaint ? In the same breath France objects that the Sultan's protests were due to British influence, and that the Sultan has no locus standi to make any objection at all as to acts affecting his authority over his own subjects. France suggests, and makes it a ground of complaint, that the Sultan would not have objected to the protection of his subjects by France bat for the intervention of Great Britain. But if the effect of this action of France is what Great Britain contends before the Tribunal, Great Britain had an undoubted right to complain to France of the breach of the Declaration of 1862, and it is difficult to see how France, after consenting to refer the matter of substance, should take refuge in points of form calculated to have no effect except to retard or prevent the decision of the points of substance. Further, if Great Britain is entitled, by virtue of the Declaration of 1862, to complain of infraction of the Saltan's independence, the Sultan is equally entitled, as aa independent Sovereign, to complain, even apart from that Declaration, of interference by France with his jurisdiction over his own sabiects. The contention that the 'Contre- . r. i • moire,' p 6. Declaration of 1862 is as to the Saltan res inter alios acta, and that he had never been asked to 'adhere to this Declaration, may be met at once by pointing out that an attack on the Saltan's inde pendence is not res inter alios acta either for the Sultan or for the other Party to the Declaration of 1862, and a significant commentary on the French declarations is to be found in the letter of M. Ottavi of the 2nd January, 1895, in which he says:— 'Heureusement, Seyyid Feysal, devant I'absence dune 'Contre- note ^crite, qu'il aurait demandee aux Anglais pour se ^ e ' tao '' e ' P' couvrir, n'aurait gn&amp;re osd intervenir d'une manure efficace, et se serait bornd ^ faire dresser chaque annde la liste de nos boutriers. 1 ' And the undated and unsigned letter, printed at p. 290 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,' which is not on record in the British Consular archives^ if authentic and correctly translated, also indi-5 cates tliat tlie Sultan tiiouglit it dangerous to remonstrate with France. Of course,, without the support of one of the Parties to the Declaration, the Sultan was not in a position to resist infractions of his independence by the other. The same observations apply as to the rights of France in case of any appearance of attack by Great-Britain on the Sultan's indepen dence. His Majesty's Government must demur to the accuracy of the statement (at p. 4 of the ' Contre-Memoire '), that Great Britain has con cerned herself more with the relations which exist, or should exist, between the French Republic and the Snltan of Muscat than with the question submitted to the Tribunal. His Majesty's Government are confident that, on perusal of the British Case and Counter-Case, the Tribunal will be satisfied that Great Britain has confined herself to the statement of the facts with relation to French protection of Omani vessels, and its effect on the jurisdiction and inde pendence of the Sultan, whereas the French Case and Counter-Case are concerned largely, if not mainly, with imputations on the policy and motives of Great Britain, and with matters foreign to the only material question in con troversy. His Majesty's Government, therefore, while not contending that the Sultan should be separately represented before the Tribunal, submit with confidence that for the due determination of the Case it is necessary to hear and consider what has passed between the Sultan and France with respect to French claims of protection. In the French ' 4 Contre-Memoire ' (p. 7) the reasons for the reference by Great Britain to the Franco-Muscat Treaty of 1844 are misunderstood. By reason of the most-favonred-nation clause in the Treaty of 1844 and the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1891, it is necessary for the European Parties to each Treaty to refer to the other Treaty in order to ascertain the full extent of the privileges conferred by it, since both Great Britain and France are entitled to the xnost-favoured-nation treatment. Consequently the Treaty of 1844, though technically res inter alios acta, is, by the effect of the clause in question, made material and relevant for the elucidation of the present controversy, and shows that the two Parties to the Declaration of 1862 stand on an equal footing as to exterritoriality in Oman.6 Bat it is also essentially material as being* apart from any qnestion of subsequently developed usage, the conventional measure of French, rights and privileges in Oman, which is a fact» recognized by France in the contentions based on its terms ( u Contre-Memoire,' p. 39); and it is difficult to understand the suggestion made at page 7 of the ' Contre-Memoire,' that the mere fact of referring to this Treaty or discus sing its terms gives an^ impression that His Majesty's Government claim to exercise a virtual protectorate, and constitutes a fresh attack on the Declaration of 1862. In approaching a juridical or quasi-juridical question, it is usual to lay before the Tribunal the material which may assist towards its solution. And in dealing with the position of Great Britain and France in Muscat, it is surely not irrelevant to point out the extent to which, at the time of the Declaration of 1862, France had extra-territorial jurisdiction in Oman, and that by the new Treaty of 1891, replacing the older Treaty of 1839, Great Britaiu acquires no extra-territorial rights which do not equally and automatically accrue in favour of France. Comment is made as to the propriety of the inclusion in the British Case (p. 73) of a state ment unofficially communicated by M. Cambon to Lord Lansdowne on the 14th August, 1901. This statement seems to have been a summary of M^moire','' pp 82, information received from French officials; and 83. His Majesty's Government, with a view to eluci date the questions raised therein, obtained from British officials, and communicated to the French Government, the information and observations contained in the documents printed at pp. 75-78 of the British Case. It is expressly stated that M. Cambon's com- British Case, munications with Lord Lansdowne were not 18 ' 7J ' official. His Majesty's Government made their inquiries and communicated their result in the hope of settling at once the questions which have led to this arbitration. They consider the inclusion of M. Cambon's statement as essential to the proper understanding of the British docu ments and reports which follow it, but do not of course claim that it in any way restricts the freedom of France in the arbitration to rest her case upon a different basis. The British Memorandum was referred to the ' Contre- Memoire.' French Consul at Muscat for his observations, 252-255. and they are included in the French ' Contre- Memoire.'7 THE SULTAN'S NOTIFICATIONS. ' Contre- Memoire,' p. 84. At p. 10 of the French ' Contre-Memoire ' a suggestion is made that the translation in the British Case (p. 69) of the Sultan's notification to his subjects of the 15th June, 1900, is seriously inaccurate, in that it is said to omit words occurring in the original. The complaint made in the ' Contre-Memoire ' is in the following words :— ' Les mots a partir tfaujourd'hui {en Arabe ' min » hazal ioum ') et le dernier paragraphe ainsi con^u: qu'il soit hien clair pour vous que cet avis a cours a partir du 16 Safav, ce figureat pas dans le texte publie au Memoire Britannique,' The British translation (except as to the date, which, by a clerical error, was given as 14 Safar instead of 16 Safar) is an accurate rendering of the notification officially supplied to the British Appendix 1, Consul by the Sultan, printed in the Appendix, which will be produced to the Tribunal. The words ' min hazil ioum ' and the final paragraph referred to, the omission of which is complained of, do not occur in this document. The copy sup plied to the American Consulate is substantially identical in form with that supplied to the British Consulate, and, in response to inquiries by the British Consul at Muscat, His Highness the Sultan has stated that the Arabic text is a correct copy, corresponding to that which was promulgated among his subjects. The French translation of the document, as printed at p. 84 of the French ' Contre-Memoire,' and a correct English translation are subjoined in parallel columns :— French Version, Correct English Translation.

'Written on 16th Safar, 1318. u Let it become clear to Note .—This last paragraph does not occur in you that this notification the document as supplied by the Sultan to . . , * _ the British and American Consulates, comes into force from the 16th Safar, and as to the, articles in the case, of which there is doubt in the matter of the date on which they were taken, there will be an investigation into it with the Government from which they have been taken, and salaams. AccordiDg to the view of His Majesty's Govern ment, the notification, read hy the light of the events which immediately preceded it, is in no sense a recognition of titres granted prior to its issue. Immediately before the issue of the notification the Sultan had visited Siir, and had there received British Case, and accepted the agreement by the Siiris to sur- Appendix 23, render all French flags held by them. The British Case, documents by which this was carried out are PP- 68-69 printed at pp. 68 and 69 of the British Case, and it is clear from those documents and from the terms of the notification itself, that the Sultan treated the acceptance of the articles and flags as inconsistent with the allegiance of his subjects to him.9 [733] THE MASIRA INCIDENT. At the end of the French Counter-Case (p. 69) the Masira incident is treated as if it constituted a violation by Great Britain of the Sultan's independence and of the obligations created by the Declaration of 1862. This incident, consisting in the murder of the crew of a British merchant ship wrecked on the Island of Masira, was naturally of a character to call for the close attention of the British Consul. The Consul did go to the island, but the offenders were dealt with by the Sultan himself, and were executed by his men, the British Consul attend ing, at the Sultan's request. The British Consul held no official inquiry in the island, and confined himself to making inquiries of some of the accused, with a view to establishing the identity of the victims of the massacre.TO THE SLAVE TRADE. ' Contre Memoire.' p. 247. It is qiiite true, as stated at p. 55 of the French a Contre-Memoire/' that the Slave Trade only indirectly concerns the present controversy. But the effect of the French action as to the Brussels Act and of the French claims in Oman is to impede its complete suppression by the Signatory Powers, and also to impede the due execution of the Sultan's arrangements for the suppression of the trade in Muscat waters, by creating &amp; class of native vessels which, according to the French claim, can be policed in these waters only by French war-ship&amp;, M. Ottavi, in his letter of the 19th June, 1895, comments on— 'cette singuliere recrudescence d'importation de negres qui se concentrerait tout entire sur le point du Sultanat de Maseate, ou nous ayons le plus d'inter^ts/' The singularity on which comment is made disappears when the facts are considered. They have already been stated, but apparently need reiteration. The part of Muscat where, accord ing to M. Ottavi, the interests of France are largest, happens also to be that occupied by tribes of Arabs who have taken advantage of their geographical position from time imme morial to engage in the Slave Trade. M. Ottavi himself gives an instance of the importation of slaves into Siir (' Contre-Memoire,' p. 265). It has already been stated in the British Counter- Case that over 100 of these Siiris were in 1902 captured in Mozambique while engaged in shipping slaves, and this capture is referred to in M. Kiesel's report of the 13th June, 1902. The ^ moire, p. 278. statement of M. Ottavi that Siiris have been offered the British flag (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 261-267) is wholly unfounded. The Siiris do not love the British flag, because they have experience of the vigilance of British cruisers for the suppression of their slaving on the high seas and in territorial waters under the Treaty of 1873. The interest which France has in Stir appears to be the protection of the residents of that place who have French flags, and whose status is the chief matter of controversy before the Tribunal *' Centre 'VJIH mmmfmrnm11 It is unfortanate that tliere is a direct conflict between the reports of British naval officers and Consuls and the officers and Consuls of France, as to whether the French flag is used to cover the carriage of slaves into Oman or the Persian Gulf. Each Party naturally believes its own officers, and it is for the Tribunal to decide between the two in any points of divergence which re relevant to this inquiry. The French reports (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. '245-251) made in 1895 strongly contest the allegations of Major Sadler, the British Consul at Muscat (British Case, p. 58). But His Majesty's Government venture to submit that it will be impossible seriously to dispute the facts stated in the British Countei^Case (AppendixVII,p.47) as to the running of slaves by one Salim-ul-Badi under French colours, and it is certainly indisputable that two Omani vessels under the French flag were captured by a British cruiser in ] 89G near the coast of Oman with slaves on board, and were tried and condemned by a French Court. There are other instances of condemnation in 'Contre- the French u Contre-Memoire' which, while 278, 1 65 ' they evidence the activity and loyalty of French officials, also demonstrate that Arab slavers do cover the Slave Trade with the French flag; and ''Contre- the note of M. Kiesel indicates that at a period Mdmoire, p. 2^2. a f^ er 1890, when Madagascar was occupied, the French naval police was relaxed, and that even in 1902 only three vessels were employed to police the ocean between Africa and Arabia. His Majesty's Government would add that in 1898 one Salim-bin-Seif was caught shipping slaves in Appendix G, vessels flying the French flag at Pemba or Zanzi bar, and was claimed by M. Laronce, the French Consul, as a French protege, and the fact that he was tried in Zanzibar and convicted and his claim to French protection overruled by the Courts, led to considerable discussion between His Majesty's Government and that of the French Republic. Into the merits of the controversy it is needless to enter. The important fact is that Salim was in 1898 running slaves under the French flag, and was stated by France to be of Siiri descent. There is clearly a great desire to get Arab vessels under the French flag. It is stated in the French Counter-Case, p. 14, that if all appli cations made had been granted, there would be hundreds of Omani vessels under the French flag, and that but for strict administration many12 more flags would be granted in French Somali- land (p. 107). The statement at p. 60 of the ' Contre- Memoire' that the International Bureau at Zanzibar has often had to register slave trading by vessels belonging to. Arab proteges of Great Britain must be based on some mistake. Examination of the Reports of the Bureau dis closes only one case of slave-running under the British flag. The vessel in question was cap- tared by a British craiser, and the number and activity of the British public vessels employed to prevent slave-running make it very dangerous to attempt to carry on the trade under the British flag. It is to be noted that the Report of the Inter national Bureau for 1899 states that there had been during the year a real recrudescence of attempts to carry on the Slave Trade with the object of meeting the demand for slaves in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and that in 1900 the Slave Trade was still going on (State Papers, vol. xciv, p. 754). In each of these years a French vessel had been seized with slaves on board. It is attempted to discredit the evidence adduced in support of the British allegations that slave trading still continues from Africa and Arabia to the Persian Gulf, and that the French flag is used at times to cover it. The two Govern ments naturally rely in the main on the reports which they receive from their officials. The French contention seems to be that no African or Indian in British service is to be believed in any statement which he makes, and that British sailors are induced, by desire for the bounties (described in the &lt;£ Gontrc-Memoire' as prize- money) to make imaginative reports. These 'Contre- / . . , tip M^moii e,' p. bounties, be it said, are only awardea aiter iudicial condemnation for slave trading, and 'CoDtre- . . . -i • -i • • M^moire, p. inconsiderate or irregular seizure brings repri mand, and not reward. (See ' The Slave Trade Act, 1873,' 36 and 37 Vict., cap. 88, sections 11-16.) It is inevitable that in African and Asiatic waters and territories some resort must be made to the evidence of natives; but even allowing a reasonable discount for Oriental inaccuracy. His Majesty's Government submit that the statements on the subject of slave dealing made by Orientals contained in the British Case must carry considerable weight more especially when all that France has tola oppose to them is the statements of other Orientals, the Arabs in question, who have a far more direct interest to deny, than the British witnesses have to affirm, the facts in controversy. Great Britain is justified in drawing attention to the international inconvenience caused to the Signatories of the Brussels Act by the refusal of France to ratify Article XLII, and it would seem that the French Commanders of war-ships engaged in suppressing the Slave Trade have found it necessary to point this out to their Government. ' Gontre- ^ M. Martel, Commander of the ' Drome,^ in his M- moire, p. 8J. re p 0rt 0 £ ^ D ecein 'h) er) 1900, says that the refusal to accept the provisions of Article XLII makes it necessary to insist on the importance of enforcing Article XXXIV of the Act as to having the name of the vessel cut in Latin characters on the stern, and the marking of the sail with the letter of the 'port d'attache,' and the register- number of the vessel. It has been pointed out in the British Case (p. 17) that the dhows which were at Stir at the date of the Sultan's visit in June 1900 had not complied with this Article XXXIV. M. Chautemps, Minister of the Colonies, ' Centre- says, in his letter of the 9th July, 1895 :— Memaire,' p. 250. ' II n'est pas impossible, n^anmoins, que des boutres de contrebande arborent ill(5galement notre pavilion pour se livrer c\ la traite avec plus de facility/' ' (Jontre- ^ ^ And Commander Kiesel, in his note of the Memoire, p. 2/2. j unej 1902, in speaking of the 'Mozambique coast, says:— ' Sur cette c6te, d'ailleurs, il y a lieu d'etre tr^s actif et tr^s prudent, parce que les boutres arborent le pavilion qn'ils jngent le plus avantageux k Imstant present Comme le Portugal y a en permanence un croiseur et plusieurs canonni^res, que TAugleterre y a en permanence . des batimentn, le pavilion fran^ais est commode, quand le croiseur fran^ais n'y est pas.' If Article XLII applied to vessels under the French flag, the abuse of the flag above referred to would be impossible. But the admission of M. Kiesel fully supports the statement made at p. II of the British Case, that Arabs who engage in the Slave Trade are fully aware of the gap created by the non-adhesion of France in the meshes of the net which would otherwise com pletely envelop their nefarious traffic, and the anxiety of France to inform all the world that the u droit de 'visite' does not exist as tovessels flying her flag on the high seas has not failed of its effect on those who seek to avoid the surveillance of an international police. They prefer the chance of an occasional visit from the French cruisers, who, until very lately, if not even now, are very few in number for the extent of sea See ' Oontr , Meinoire,' p wnicn tney nave to patrol. The observations made as to the credulity of the British Consul at Muscat in 1899 in the case of Mbarak-ben-Baroul are not justified by the documents on which they purport to be based. These documents show that the native in question ' Contre- escaped or deserted from a dhow flying the French flag and took refuge on His Majesty's ship 44 Pigeon,' stating that he was in slavery and demanding freedom. He was taken to the British Consulate and at once sent on to the French Consulate and placed at the disposal of the French Consul, the British Consul making no examination as to his statements, and expressing no opinion whatever as to the truth of the man's statements or the justice of his claim, but merely sending him to the person whose business it was to verify the allegations made.15 THE QUESTIONS OF FACT INVOLVED. The facts relating to the present controversy are not numerous or complicated. No attempt is made by France to deny the accuracy of the British account of the incident of the quarantine-breakers, or to suggest that any one of these men was on a vessel under the French flag when sent to quarantine, or when he escaped or when he was recaptured. Under these circumstances Consular jurisdiction over the men seems to have been claimed under the Treaty of 1844; at least no other ground is suggested. Nor again is any attempt made to contradict the substance of the British account British Case,p. 21. of the incidents of Suweik and Debai. The former case was a claim to deal with the succession to Salim-bin-Mahommed which must have been a question of purely Mahommedan law affecting d native of Suweik. The second related to the use of the French flag by the son of the above Salim. If new papers had been given to the son after the death of the father in 1902, there would have been a breach of M. Cambon's undertaking of the 26th June, 1900. Appendix 3, p. 43. Since the delivery of the British Counter-Case a report has been received from Zanzibar that an Arab, who seems to be the Ali-bin-Salem (No. 17 on the revised French list), has come under suspicion of slave-trading, and has been deprived of his French papers by M. Ottavi, the French Consul at Zanzibar. The references in the French &lt;£ Contre- Memoire ' to the Debai incident (pp. 68-69) make it expedient- to restate that incident in somewhat greater detail. Debai is on the Pirate Coast, and is not part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, and its Chief is one of the Trucial Chiefs referred to in the British Counter-Case, p. 21. The representations made by the French Consul to the Sultan of Muscat seem to have 'been made in the belief that the Chief of Debai was a dependent or feudatory of the Sultan of Muscat, which is not the case. The French Consul, also, on the 24th March, 1904, wrote direct to the Chief of Debai the letter of Appendix 2, p. 43. which a copy is annexed. The action of the British Consul at Muscat, with reference to the Debai [733] D16 case, can in no sense be construed as indicating the exercise of any protectorate over Muscat. On being consulted by the Sultan as to the French Consul's communication, the British Consul gave it as his opinion that as the man alleged to have been wronged at Debai was one of the Sultan s subjects resident at Suweik, in Oman, the claim on the Chief of Debai ought to be made by the Sultan, and not through the French Consul. The first question of fact is whether France has granted to subjects of the Sultan French flags and papers. The recital of the ' Com- promis' constitutes an admission by France that France has granted French flags and papers to certain Muscat ship-owners. This admission is supplemented by the inclusion in the French ' M&amp;noire ' , (p. 58) and ' Contre-Memoire ' r (p. 297) of two lists, headed ' Proprietaires de Boutres mascatais frangises.' The Tribunal is not asked to decide anything except as to dhows owned by subjects of the Sultan and flying the French flag or furnished with French papers, and as to the families of such persons, and as to the captains and crews of such vessels, and perhaps also the families of these latter persons. It is for France to show that persons falling within these categories have been lawful^ transferred from their natural allegiance to that of France, or have lawfully been brought under French protec tion either before or by means of the francisation which is alleged to have taken place. His Majesty's Government have no doubt that if any such persons have, by false statements or fraudu lent devices, imposed upon French officials and improperly obtained francisation, the Government of the French Republic, on ascertaining the truth, would not hesitate to strip them of the privileges which have been thus improperly obtained ; and His Majesty's Government submit with confidence that they have established that the Siiris in question are originaires of Oman, and are not settlers or residents in French Colonies, but sailors whose home is in Oman, paying business visits only to various ports in the Indian Ocean. If the French contention were right, it would be open to contend that the French fishermen who annually, for long periods, visit Iceland or the Newfoundland banks, and only return home for the winter, have not their domicile in France. It is not clear whether France contests the accuracy of the statement that the Signatories to17 ' Mdmoire,' pp. 66-70. British Counter- Case, p. 12. ' Oontre- M^moire,' p. 297. the undertaking given in June 1900 to the Sultan at Siir are natives of, and resident in, Oman. The letters of some of these men contain various allegations as to visits to French Colonies and having been in French service ; but these asser tions made with the object of obtaining French protection cannot be accepted in the absence of corroborative evidence. It appears to be admitted by France in the recital of the ' Compromis,' and in the two lists of dhow-owners, that Omanis are in possession of French flags and papers. These lists have already been criticised in the British Counter- Case, and the identity of the persons specified therein to some extent ascertained. The revised list in the French ' Contre-Memoire ' differs from that in the original Case by omitting four names:— Selim-ben-Rachid (No. 20 in first list); Selim Bonheti (No. 21 „ ); Selim Mohammed Libadi (No. 23 in the first list, the man whose doings are described somewhat fully in the British Counter-Case, p. 47); and Salim-bin-Mohammed Wad Taheb (No. 27 in the first list); by ascribing to Ali-bin-Salim-bin-Rachid (No. 2) a second vessel, and by ascribing to Ali-bin- Salim Wad Taheb (No. 17) four vessels which in the first list were ascribed to Salim-bin- Mohammed Wad Taheb. From the Report printed in AppendixNo. 3,p. 43, it would seem that the French titre and flag of one of the four vessels—the Fath-el-Kheir—has very recently been taken away by the French Consul at Zanzibar. No details whatever are given as to the grounds on which the dhow-owners on the lists were placed there, nor where, nor why these Arabs got French papers. Instead of giving this information, it is con tended that— 'Coutre- 'la France ne saurait reconnaitre au Sultan de Mascate Mdmoire,' P 8. I'exercice d'un controle sur I'octroi du pavilion tricolore dans les Colonies fraiiQaises; cette pratique ^tant basee sur le droit interne de I'llltat fran^ais.' This contention evades the question in dispute. It is not necessary to inquire as to the municipal law of France with respect to the grant of the French flag to ships, so long as the ships in ques tion remain in French waters. Nor is it necessary [733] D 218 to inquire as to the effect on the higli seas or in the waters of third Powers of the French law as to the grant of the French flag. What the Tribunal has to consider is whether France can, under cover of her municipal law, give to subjects of another Power in the territories and waters of that Power an extra-territorial and privileged position and exemption from the laws of their natural Sovereign. According to the view of His Majesty's Government, the contention of France is that the municipal law as to the grant of flags is to prevail outside her own territory over inter national law and the municipal law of other States. And after thus disposing of the claim of the Sultan to information as to the reasons for withdrawing his subjects from his jurisdiction, it is further susc^ested that Great Britain is guilty ' Contre- p . . ..i i ■ M&amp;noire,' oi a petitio pnncipn in treating as settled a prion pp 8 in favour of the Sultan the question of the statut personnel of all the dhow-owners who are originaires d'Oman on suppose's tels, and who have obtained French papers, and France not only makes express reserve against the British view, but also appears to deny any obligation to give any written explanation of the grounds on which each titre was granted. What, according to the French view, is the statut personnel of a Moslem Arab born and residing in Oman, who has wives in the various ports to which he takes his ship in the sailing season, and who flies the French flag ? Is his right to marry, or the transmission of his property, determined by the ' Code Napoleon ' or by the Koran ? Does he retain his siatat personnel as an Omani Arab, with a right to decline the jurisdiction of the Court best competent to determine the appropriate prescrip tions of the Mohammedan law ? The natural and ordinary presumption as to a person who is originaire of a particular State is that he is the subject of the Sovereign of that State. Where he is not only an originaire, but also ordinarily resident in that State, the pre sumption is strengthened. And if any State claims that a person born and ordinarily resident in another State is a subject or protege of the first State, it is in accordance with all rules of law and justice that the claiming State should furnish proof of the grounds of its claim. It is true that under certain conditions in modern times what is termed ' double nationality ' arises.19 For instance, a Frenchman duly naturalized in the United States may, nevertheless, continue to be a French citizen if he has not satisfied his obligations under French military law or other laws. In such a case the United States, though always ready and constitutionally bound to afford the amplest protection to its citizens throughout the world, recognizes that a Frenchman naturalized in America under the conditions indicated has no claim to American protection in France. The same principle is recognized by the British Naturalization Act, 1870. When an origin aire of any State is claimed as citizen or protege of another, it is juridically impossible to suppose that the Sovereign is bound to accept the mere statement of the Agents of the other Power that the person claimed is its subject. In an ordinary European State such a claim would, of course, not have much effect, since the system of exterritoriality is not there recognized; but in a State in which exterritoriality, or immunity from local jurisdiction, is recognized by Treaty or usage, it is essential, to prevent abuse, that the person claiming immunity from the local authori ties, or the ower who claims it for him should prove that he falls within one of the categories of privileged persons. To hold otherwise would be to allow the claiming Power to be its own judge on controverted questions of fact and law and of the interpretation of Treaties. In this Arbitration it devolves on France to lay before the Arbitrators the grounds on which she seeks to withdraw from the Sultan those of his subjects whose names appear on the lists already referred to, or others of his subjects who, though not on the lists, may be in consimili casu. The knowledge of the grounds for granting francisation or French flags to such vessels or persons is peculiarly within the reach of France, and is not accessible to Great Britain nor to the Sultan of Muscat. It is stated that •' Memoire,' p 13 registers exist at Muscat of all Arab vessels which h^va been francises and of their owners and captains. It is known that Hires are granted to their vessels. The copies of such litres which have reached His Majesty's Government indicate that if these titres are properly filled in, abundant indications will be afforded of the place where the proprietor is said to reside, where his vessel was francise, and the like, although, as has been pointed out in the British Case, pp. 16, 45-47, in20 certain of these titres most essential information, viz., as to the residence of the proprietors, has been omitted. France seems also to object that Great Britain 'Centre-^ is not entitled (' qnalifiee ') to verify the list of [ French dhow owners, because this would involve a critical examination of French municipal legis lation. Great Britain has no interest in, and makes no claim to examine into, French municipal legislation ; and is content to take the statement of France as to what such legislation is. But, as already stated, when France seeks to give extra territorial effect or international validity to her municipal legislation, then the right of foreign Powers arises to question the validity and effect of such legislation outside its proper bounds. The French arguments as to making domicile a ground for claiming an originaire of Muscat as a French protege in Muscat have already been dealt with in the British Counter-Case (p. 10). It is enough to refer the Tribunal to these arguments and to add the following remarks 1. Domicile is not equivalent to nationality. 2. Domicile may give certain rights in the country in which it is acquired, and may alter the statut personnel or the descent of property by virtue of the rule mobilia sequuntur personam, but it gives no title to protection as a national in other countries, least of all in that of origin. 3. It lies with those who assert that the domicile of origin has been lost to prove the assertion. France has not adduced any evidence at all that any of the dhow owners of Muscat origin have acquired a domicile in any French possession. The Tribunal is, on this point, referred to the latest judicial exposition of the subject in the English Courts (Winans v. Attorney-General, Law Re ports, 1904, Appeal Cases, p. 287)—a case in which the liability to taxation of the personal estate of a deceased American subject depended on whether he had become domiciled in the United Kingdom. mmm. mmma K iii,I wan21 RIGHTS OF POLICE AND JURISDICTION IN TERRITORIAL WATERS. It is not easy to see what bearing this question has upon the point submitted for decision in this Arbitration, but as it is very fully discussed in the French ' Contre-Memoire,' His Majesty's Govern ment think it right to make some observations upon it. Perusal of the French u Contre-Memoire ' dis closes a tendency to confusion between three very distinct questions :— 1. The ' droit de visite,' or right of search on the high seas; 2. The police powers of territorial Sovereigns in their own waters ; and 3. The extent to which a Power can exercise supervision or jurisdiction over its own vessels in the waters of another Power by permission of that Power. The question of the ' droit de visite' has only an incidental bearing upon the present controversy. It is well known to all students of international law that France, for many years, whether from national sentiment, as suggested in the ' Contre-Memoire,' or from particular theories Centre- of international law, has been resolutely opposed Mdmoire,'- p. 54. ^ g rail ^ n g any other Power the right to search vessels carrying the French flag on the high seas^ ' Coutre- ail( j that the naval instructions of 1867'* mark Memoire,' p. 113. , ^ the utmost limit of French concessions to brreat Britain on this point. Other Powers which have taken the French view have, by adherence to the Brussels Act, assented to the search of certain vessels under their flag found in the Indian Ocean, and to that extent have granted the ' droit de visite.' It is asserted that British officers have On occasion shown an excess of zeal or have gone beyond the instructions of 1867. Whether they ' Contue- have done so is wholly immaterial to the ^5-149%6 P 0-163. P resent case, and His Majesty's Government do not think it necessary to discuss each case in detail, and are content to point out that Article 13 pf the instructions indicates the remedy to be pursued. * Described by a clerical error as of 1887 in the British Case.22 Not content with, a wholly unnecessary elabora tion of French policy as to the ' droit de visite,' the 'Contre-Memoire' under some misunder standing puts forward the supposition that Great Britain denies or questions the rights and •privileges of the French flag on the high seas. As between Great Britain and France, the question of the ' droit de visite ' has passed from the stage of international controversy to that of convention by the regime agreed on in the Joint Instructions of 1867. As to other Powers which have acceded to the Brussels Act, the ' droit de visite ' in the Indian seas is mutually conceded by the Brussels Act. His Majesty's Government can well conceive that a Power to whose subjects France has granted French papers and quasi- protection in the manner adopted as to Omanis might claim as against France to defeat such usurpation by search even on the high seas of such vessels ; but it is not necessaryto deal with any such contention in the present case. Before leaving this subject, it is, however, desirable to explain to the Tribunal that the desire of Great Britain that there should be a mutual right of search over native vessels in seas frequented by slavers—a desire which has been accomplished by the accession of almost every Power except France to such an arrangement—was to secure an effective international police of the infested seas instead of the isolated and ineffective national system which France prefers. Nothing was further from the desire of Great Britain than, as is suggested in the French ' Contre-Memoire,' to destroy the influence of France in these seas. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government must protest against the wholly gratuitous introduction of two documents relating to questions which arose between Great Britain and the United States in 1857 and 1858 as to vessels suspected of fraudu lently using the American flag. The full text of the correspondence is to be found in the British 'State Papers,' vol. xlviii, pp. 1244-1250, and vol. xlix, p. 1103, et sen., and no doubt also in the American diplomatic correspondence. Great Britain and the United States were in perfect accord as to the necessity of stopping the oversea traffic in slaves under the American flag, and as to the accuracy of many, if not all, of the British statements. The only difference between the two Powers was, as to the nature of the visite which a British vessel might make to a vessel on the high seas flying(S) 23 ' State Papers,' vol. xlix, p. 1113 Opinions of United States' Attorney- General, vol. iv, p. 285, Novem ber 29, 1843. British Case pp 72, 75. American colours, and the United States were so far convinced that their laws and surveillance were insufficient that more cruisers were detailed to suppress the abuse of the flag, and that a Bill was submitted to Congress to strengthen the law against slave trading. The Tribunal will also remember that the United States, in 1892, adhered to the Brussels Act. The right of police in territorial waters is wholly distinct from the 'droit de visite.' The latter applies only to the high seas—the highway of nations. But it seems to be as fully admitted as any doctrine of international law that a public vessel of one State has no right to exercise police powers even over the merchant vessels of its own State in the territorial waters of another State. To quote the opinion of Mr. Nelson, Attorney-General of the United States, given in 1843 in the case of the schooner ' Ariel'— 'It is quite clear that the seizure of an American vessel by another, also American, within the jurisdiction of a foreign Government for an infringement of American revenue or navigation laws is a violation of the territorial authority of the foreign Government.' Opinions to the same effect could be multiplied, but it is enough to say that it is an essential element in the conception of independent sovereignty that no foreign Power should, with out the consent of the Sovereign, exercise within his territory or waters any coercive jurisdiction over any person. It is, of course, within the competence of the territorial Sovereign expressly to grant or to acquiesce in the exercise within his waters by the public vessels of another State of powers of surveillance or police over merchant vessels flying the flag of that State, and much of the French Case is taken up by an attempt to prove that this concession has been made to France by the Sultan of Muscat, or that this power has been, by Treaty, or acquiescence, or otherwise, acquired by France. France claims that in the waters of Oman she has acquired in some such way the sole right of surveillance or police over vessels flying the French flag, and that the territorial authority of the Sultan is excluded. Her contentions have somewhat shifted on this point. In March 1902 the French Consul wrote to the [733] ' E24 Sultan that France only claimed the right of surveillance and police conferred by the Brussels Act over vessels flying the French flag. It has already been pointed out in the British Case that British Case, the Sultan is not a Signatory to that Act, and that p it does not give any Power any right of surveil lance or police in the waters of another Power, though it does give to the Powers which have adhered to Article XLII a mutual right of search on the high seas. In 1903 M. Cambon stated to Lord Lansdowne that the Treaty of 1844 was not.-designed to meet British Case, the case of the dhow owners, ^that their rights were in many cases anterior to the Treaty, that the French flag holders were altogether out side the Treaty, and that protection was claimed for them not under the Treaty, but because they had been given French papers, and were entitled to fly the French flag. This contention has already been stated and criticised at p. 25 of the British Case. But France has now abandoned the contentions of M. Laronce and M. Cambon, and in the ' Contre-Memoire' for the first time takes up the position that she is entitled under the Treaty of 1844 to the exclusive right of police in Muscat waters over vessels flying the French flag. The arguments in support of this contention are, for the most part, contained in the opinion of M. Renault. In limine, His Majesty's Government venture to point out that, eminent as p 150, is the reputation of M. Renault, his opinion can have no other effect on this arbitration than that of an advocate consulted by one of the High Parties to the arbitration, and that the case sub mitted to him for his opinion is not included in the ' Contre-Memoire. 1 ' Great Britain contends (1) that France cannot rely on the Brussels Act to justify the exercise of police powers in those waters, bBcause the Sultan is not a party to that Act, and because that Act specially reserves the rights of the territorial Sovereign as to vessels in his waters ; (2) that the Sultan has done no act to surrender or delegate to France his authority in his own waters. 1. It is difficult to see how France can juri dically meet the first of these contentions. Indeed, she endeavours to do so mainly by suggesting that the Slave Trade Treaties between Great Britain cmd Muscat upset the balance and equality which ought to result from the Declaration of1862. This contention lias already been disposed of in the British Counter-Case (p. 33). 2. But the second contention is that which the weight of M. Renault's opinion is directed to meet. France admits that the Sultan of Muscat— ' Oontre- ' possede les droits que lui conf^re la souverainet^ sur ses M^moire, p. 87. gu j e t s e t dans ses ^tats and includes in this admission the right to make ' Ooutre^ Quarantine Regulations, but makes a grievance of Mdmoire, p. 38. ^ f act that the Sultan, in enforcing the Regula tions, has utilized! the services of British subjects, forgetting that if the right exists it is for the Sultan to decide on the executive agents to be chosen. After these admissions and this com plaint, a distinct and definite proposition is enunciated:— ' Contra- ' Si le Sultan de Mascate possode dans ses eaux terri- Memoire,' p. 38. toriales un droit de police et de juridiction k I'egard des navires arborant le pavilion rouge Mascatais, il n en poss&amp;de aucun sur les navires, boutres, ou autres qui portent le pavilion tricolore.' To prove this proposition it is argued that ships flying the French flag fall within the words of the Treaty of 1844, Article III. Examination of that Article, which is printed at p. 6 of the British Case, will show that it begins by granting permission to Frenchmen to buy, sell, or take on lease lands, houses, and shops in Oman, and prohibits entry, on any pretext, into the houses, shops, and other properties (' autres proprietes ') possessed or occupied by Frenchmen or persons in French service. It is perfectly clear from the context that the Article relates to ' immeubles,' and gives ' anx fran^ais a right to acquire them, and that in the second place it pro vides against violation of the domicile of 'fran^ais who have acquired such ' immenbles,' and of ' Contre- ^ persons in their service. Nothing in the Article JVTemcire,' p. 151. ^ ^ reasonably extended to ships, and though M. Renault so contends, he does so faintly, saying that if the action of the territorial Sovereign is restricted on land, ' on pent affirmer qu'a plus forte raison elle Test, et doit I'etre, pour les eaux territoriales.' This amounts to reading into a document, on theoretical grounds, words which do not occur in it and are in no way necessary for its correct interpretation. The Treaty is not silent about French ships, [733] E 226 but its articles do not contain any express provision as to French vessels in territorial waters, or excluding the right of police by the Sultan, and do not give any colour to any theory of exemption from visit. Such an exemption would be incon sistent with the right to enforce the Revenue, Customs, and quarantine laws of Oman, for which purposes it is essential to board and examine vessels entering at Oman ports ; and it can hardly be regarded as a necessary part of a Treaty to facilitate commerce that smuggling by the ships of a foreign State or disregard of quarantine should be made easy. M. Renault, after dealing somewhat lightly with the exact wording of the Treaty of 1844, devotes a great part of his opinions to arguments based partly on views of French national policy or the manifest intention (' esprit manifeste') of the Treaty, but mainly on allegations of established usage, which, in his view, interpret or supplement the Treaty in a manner harmoni zing with the French contentions. The state ments of facts and the diplomatic documents to which he refers relate wholly and solely to Zanzibar, and not a single fact is stated with reference to the express or tacit admission in Oman of the existence in favour of France of the exclusive right of surveillance over French vessels in Oman waters. The French Treaty of 1844 applied to Oman and Zanzibar as a single State for twelve years, until the separation of the two territories into distinct States in 1856. Thenceforth it was recognized by the Sovereigns of the two States as applying to each State separately. Nothing that happened between France and Zanzibar between 1856 and 1905 can be construed as binding the Sultan of Muscat either as matter of usage, concession, or interpretation of the Treaty. The earlier Colonies in the Indian Ocean pos sessed by France were near Zanzibar and far from Muscat, and France had so little concern with Oman that it was not until 1894 that she installed a Vice-Consul there, or instituted any Court in which any person claiming to be her protege could be dealt with j udicially. Nor is there any trace in the French ' Memoire ' or ' Contre- Memoire ' of any grant of French flags to Muscat vessels before 1891, or of any exercise by France of rights of police in Oman waters before that date. It is unnecessary to deal in detail with the27 various controversies which have arisen between Great Britain and France as to the territory and waters of Zanzibar, because they have, fortunately, been terminated by the arrangement evidenced by Appendix 4, p. 44 letters of the 13th and 18th May, 1904. But His Majesty's Government cannot be con sidered as admitting that the contentions of France with respect to Zanzibar were juridically well-founded, although in a spirit of amity an adjustment has, in the case of Zanzibar, been effected which satisfies the aspirations of both Powers and meets the needs of the situation. M. Renault's arguments as to the effect on the status quo ante of the establishment of a Pro tectorate relate only to Zanzibar, and in no way affect Oman, which is not a Protectorate. Before passing from this part of the Case, it is perhaps well again to point out that the main point in controversy is not whether France has any power to police in Oman waters vessels admittedly French, but whether France, by per mitting the use of her flag to persons who are not her subjects nor her proteges, nor within the immunities given by the Treaty of 1844, can extend to such persons any immunities she may possess in Oman. Even assuming that France had acquired some modified rights in Oman waters over vessels admittedly French, this is a very different thing from the claim of exclusive police in the Sultan's waters by French officials over any Arab dhow which flies the French flag. Still more does it differ from the claim which has hitherto been coupled with it that the owner and crews of such vessels and their families shall be exempt when ashore from the Sultan's jurisdiction. The true international rule on this subject is well stated in the decision of the United States' Supreme Court, of which an extract is given in Appendix, p. 5.S8 THE CAPITULATIONS AND EXTERRI TORIALITY. A considerable portion of the Frencb. Counter- Case (pp. 39 et seq.) is taken np by arguments tbat the ' regime des Capitulations ' applies to Muscat. . These arguments, except so far as they are based on Treaties with the Sultan, or established usage in his dominions, are an attempt to import into the relations of France with Oman usages which may exist between France and other Oriental States. It is acknowledged that Capitulations and Treaties or Conventions creating exterritoriality are exceptional and contrary to the ordinary rules of public international law, and that the excep tions arise from particular sanctioning documents or concessions from the Sovereign of the country to which they apply. As a general rule, there fore, in order to ascertain to what extent the territorial Sovereign is excluded from jurisdiction over the subjects or proteges of another Power, it is necessary to examine the Treaties, and, if need be, the usage in force between the territorial Sovereign and the other Power concerned, and it is rarely, if ever, of value to refer to the Capitu lations existing with other Powers. Although, where several Powers have with an Oriental State Treaties giving exterritorial juris diction couched in somewhat different terms, but containing a most-favoured-nation clause, it may, as in the present case (see ante, p. 5), be necessary to examine all such Treaties in order to determine the exact limits of the extra-territorial jurisdiction conceded, it is never admissible to contend that because one Oriental Power has conceded a particular and wide exterritorial jurisdiction, ^a similar concession should be read into Capitu lations made with another Oriental Power; nor can any argument be drawn from usage in the ease of one Oriental Power to establish the existence of any such usage in the case of another Power.^ • '• En thfcse g^n^rale, il faut reconnaitre qu'en pareille matiere il pent j avoir des questions d'esp^ce suivant la nature des Protectorats, et, encore, suivant les engagements des proteges et des protecteurs en vers les autres nations.'— M. Barbey, ' Coutre-Memoire,' p. 213.29 The Ottoman Regulations of 1863 and 1865, referred to both in the British and the French Cases, are relevant only as showing the determi nation of the Porte to put an end to the abuses of protection which then existed, and of the admission of the European Powers that the attitude of the Porte was consistent both with its territorial sovereignty and with international law, and the fact that these laws were not made retro spective is of no probative value in the present case, in which the question is whether certain persons are or are not now properly claimed by France as proteges. It may be observed that, under the Ottoman Law of Nationality, a native of the Ottoman Empire is presumed to be an Ottoman subject unless he can prove to the contrary, the onus probavdi lying not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction, and the inter national Award between Greece and Turkey, set out at p. 91 of the British Case, is an even stronger and more authoritative international recognition of the limits which should be placed on extra-territorial jurisdiction in Oriental States. As a matter of negotiation, distinct from a question of fact or of international or municipal law, the recognition of the claim of a certain limited number of persons to be proteges of the claiming Power might be conceded as a means for determining a controversy, but such concession would be the price of peace, and not an admission of the justice of the claim, and it was as a matter of negotiation that the Porte made the concession in question, and not in affirmation of any rule of international law. It may be added that in the long history of the Capitulations in Turkey very many Treaties had been made, and very many usages and abuses had grown up in the course of centuries ; while as between Muscat and France the extra-terri torial rights granted to France in Oman, what ever they may be, cannot be dated back beyond 1844. And while the situation in Turkey was complicated by the presence of a very large Christian population of numerous sects (each sect allowed by the Porte in many matters to be governed by the laws of its Church), perpetually invoking the sympathy and protection of France or Russia or some other European Power, the population of Oman is in the main Arab and30 Moslem, with very few Europeans or Christiajas, and only a few small communities professing some non-Moslem Eastern religion; and the persons whom France seeks to protect (unlike the Banians and Louwatias) are Arabs marked off from the rest of the Arab population of Oman only by the fact of the claim to French protec tion. The chief reason for the existence of exterritoriality is the difference between Oriental and European usages ; and in the case of the Siiri Arabs the raison d'etre of a claim of exterri toriality is excluded by the facts of their origin, race, religion,' and residence. Having thus indicated the contention of His Majesty's Government that Capitulations with Turkey do not afford any sound foundation for any argument in favour of France in the case of Muscat, it is necessary, before dealing with that part of the French Case which is based on the French interpretation of the Treaty of 1844, to dispose of certain references made to alleged «Q ontre . inconsistency between the British contentions M^moire,' and British practice. 1. The position of the Khojas or Louwatias has been fully explained in the British Counter-Case (pp. 35, 73.) That explanation clearly shows that these persons, so far from being all incon- testably subjects of the Sultan, form a distinct community of Indian origin, and under British protection if they choose to claim it; and that British officials have never gone beyond denying to a Khoja the right to abjure British protection merely as a means of evading his just debts. 2. In Persia Great Britain protects her Indian subjects settled there and their descendants to a limited extent, but this right of protection has never been exercised in a way inconsistent with the law of Persia. The British view as to Persia is best expressed in the following extract from a despatch by Lord John Russell to Mr. Alison :— ' Considering the question apart from all questions of usage, policy, or expediency, but exclusively and strictly with reference to the principles of international law pre vailing amongst Christian nations, I have to state to you that a child of a Persian father born in the Queen's dominions and returning to Persia will not, whilst in Persia, be entitled to British protection if (as stated) the law of Persia considers him a Persian subject by reason of his Persian descent; and on this principle Syad Abdullah could not, whilst he remained in Persia, claim, or be31 [733] F claimed to be, treated there as a British subject. Although, therefore, this would be the correct rule of international law, yet, as it has not hitherto been acted on in Persia, I think it very inexpedient that it should now be made a rule of English procedure there unless it is also made * common to all other European nations, and especially France and Eussia.' 3. Great Britain doss not protect CMnese subjects in Siam either with or without a con dition as to three years' residence there. In the year 1895 the question of such protection was discussed between the British and Chinese Governments at a time when it was supposed that Japanese in Siam were to be protected by France. But Japan abandoned the idea of putting her subjects in Siam under French pro tection ; and Great Britain never undertook the protection of the Chinese, which, be it said, in the absence of any Treaty between China and Siam granting extra-territoriality, would, if undertaken, not have ousted the jurisdiction of the Siamese Courts. This disposes of the unfounded state ment made at p. 24 of the French ' Contre- Memoire ':— 'Au Siam elle admet I'mscription a sa Legation de Cbinois qui ne.sont pas nds sur un territoire britannique ou plac^ sous le protectorat anglais, mais qui resident depuis au moins trois ans 4 Bangkok. Ces Chinois sont alors consid^rds comme prot^g^s britanniques, et ils ont . ineme obtenu que la protection qu'ils jouissent au Siam leur soit continu^e quand ils se rendent en Chine.' It will be, perhaps, more satisfactory to the Tribunal to know exactly what persons Great Britain does protect in Siam. The matter is governed by the Anglo-Siamese Agreement of the 29th November, 1899, which is in the fol lowing terms :— u Agreement between the United Kingdom and Siam relative to the Registration of British Subjects in Siam. ' Signed at Bangkok, November 29, 1899. ' The Governments of Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, and of His Majesty the King of Siam, recogni zing the necessity of having a satisfactory arrangement for the registration of British subjects in Siam, the32 Undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Minister Resident and His Siamese Majesty's Minister for Foreign Affairs duly authorized to that effect, have agreed as follows:— 'I. »' The registration according to Article V of the Treaty of April 18,1855 * of British subjects residing in Siara, shall comprise the following categories : '• (1.) All British natural born or naturalized subjects, other than those of Asiatic descent. u (2.) All children and grandchildren born in Siam of persons entitled to be registered under the first category, who are entitled to the status of British subjects in contemplation of English law. ' Neither great-grandchildren nor illegitimate children born in Siam of persons mentioned in the nrst category are entitled to be registered. (3.) All persons of Asiatic descent, born within the Queen's dominions, or naturalized within the United Kingdom, or born within the territory of any Prince or State in India under the suzerainty of, or in alliance with, the Queen. 'Except natives of Upper Burmah or the British Shan States who became domiciled in Siam before January 1st, 1886. ' (4 ) All children born in Siam of persons entitled to be registered under the third category. ' ISlo grandchildren born in Siam of persons mentioned in the third category are entitled to be registered for protection in Siam. ' (5.) The wives and widows of any persons who are entitled to be registered under the foregoing categories. '11. ' The lists of such registration shall be open to the inspection of a properly authorized Representative of the Siamese Government on proper notice being given. 'in. 'If any question arises as to the right of any person to hold a British certificate of registration or as to the validity of the certificate itself, a joint inquiry shall be held by the British and Siamese authorities and decided according to the conditions laid down in this Agree ment, upon evidence to be adduced by the holder of the certificate, in the usual way. 'IV. 'Should any action, civil or criminal, be pending while such inquiry is going on, it shall be determined conjointly in what Court the case shall be heard. ♦ Hertsiet's Commercial Treaties, vol. x, p. 557.k 'V. 'If the person in respect of whom the inquiry is held come within the conditions for registration laid down in Article I, he mxy, if not yet registered forth with be registered as a British subject and provided with a certificate of registration at Her Britannic Mijesty's Consulate; otherwise he shall be recognized as falling under Siamese jurisdiction, and, if already on the lists of Her Britannic Majesty's Consulate, his name shall be erased. 'In witness whereof the Undersigned have signed the same in duplicate and have affiled thereto their seals at Bangkok, on the 29th day of November, 1899, of the Christian era, corresponding to the 118th year of Ratanakosindr. (Seal.) (Signed) 'GEORGE GREVILLE. (Seal.) (Signed) 'DEVAWONGSE VAROPRAKAR.' On reference to the 1st Article, it will be seeii that persons of Asiatic descent are not entitled to be registered as British subjects in Siam unless— (1.) Born within His Majesty's dominions; (2.) Naturalized in the United Kingdom. (3.) Born within the territory of feudatory or allied Princes, or States in British India. The fact of registration is not conclusive (see Article III), and provision is made for settling by j oint inquiry the right of any person to hold a certificate of registration, and the burden of proof of the validity of the certificate, is thrown on the holder. Great Britain is fully aware of the difficulties created by what is termed 'double nationality,' and it is specifically provided by ' The Naturaliza tion Act, 1870,' 33 &amp; 34 Yict., cap. 14, sec. 7, para. 3, that—&gt; 'An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall not, when he was within the limits of the foreign State of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that State in pursuance of the laws thereof or in pursuance of a Treaty to that effect.' This legislation is in strict accordance with modern views as to nationality, recognizing the authority of the original Sovereign in his own territory, and claiming to protect the naturalized persons only in countries of which he has never been a subject. [733] E 234 In Oman Great Britain has never claimed to protect native Arabs unless they were bond fide in the service of British subjects, and in the case of one Ali-bin-Juma, who had obtained naturalization in India, the British Consul, on finding that he was an originaire of Oman, struck him off the register of British subjects.35 FRENCH PRACTICE AS TO ' FR AN CIS A TI ON.'' In the French ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 11) it is said to be quite inaccurate to make, in general and categorical terms, the allegation that French Consuls give protection papers to dhow-owners. His Majesty's Government are not concerned to allege or prove that all French Consuls are authorized so to act, and are content to indicate the particular instances in which they have done so. But it is a mistake to say that Great Britain has only given a single instance as to one port of the grant by French Consuls of French papers, namely, at Aden. The first instance, it is true, is that of the grant of French papers to Siiri vessels by the French Consul at Aden. This action is admitted by France to have been irregular. His Majesty's Government were for some years under the impression that M. Ribot's admission of irregularity was meant to apply to all cases of grant by French Consuls to Suri vessels, and in the British Case reference was made to M. Ribot's statement, not to impugn its correctness or propriety, but to explain that upon a misunderstanding as to its exact effect Great Britain during some years refrained from protests, which would certainly have been made had its true meaning been understood. It is also clear that the French Consul at Zanzi bar has in many cases granted, and not merely renewed or prolonged, litres de navigation. This is admitted in the French Case (p. 14), and in many of the annexed documents, particularly in the report of M. Labosse of 22nd May, 1895. It is difficult to understand w r here the vessels at Siir can have obtained the French papers cf which they are in. possession. The two lists supplied give no indication. The documents contained in the French Counter-Case (p. 107) appear to show— (a .) That at Mayotte no Hire has been issued for six years, and that they are issued there only to Frenchmen or French subjects. (b .) That in French Somaliland it is quite the exception to grant to a dhow the right to fly the36 French flag ; and that before grant it is required that the vessel should— 1. Belong to a French Company ; or 2. Belong to natives (indigenes) permanently resident (' etablis a demeure ') in that territory and possessing realty there. (c.) That in Madagascar, the Departmsnt con- cemed, has always refused the French flag to foreign vessels. It is said not to be a regular practice to grant titres at French Consulates, and it may be pre sumed that the practice of granting them at the French Consulate in Zanzibar, which is admitted to have prevailed at one time, has now been discontinued. Where, then, are the titres in question granted ? The natural and obvious conclusion would seem to be that they are granted at Muscat, and it is submitted that this conclusion must prevail in the absence of more definite explanations by France as to the origin of these grants. In his letter of the 19th June, 1895, M. Ottavi says that no dhow had been registered (' inscrit ') at Muscat, and that all that he knew on the subject was that the Vali of Siir had told him there were in Siir thirty dhows francises, M. Ottavi also said that the British list submitted to him must be verified at Majunga (in Mada gascar), Obokh, and Mayotte, and perhaps at Zanzibar, (' Contre-Memoire,' pp. 249, 250). It is also stated in the French ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 14) that the French Consul, since he took up his post at Muscat, has made it a rule not to grant titres at Muscat or at Siir. It is difficult to reconcile this statement, which is made in a report dated the 30th June, 1897, with the two titres printed at p. 46 of the British Case, the first dated in 1898, the second 1899, both issued at Muscat, and signed by M. Ottavi, who himself made the report in question. The inference appears to be that til res have been granted at Muscat in the first instance, and it seems not to be denied that a practice has prevailed of renewing there titres which had originally been granted elsewhere. It is not easy to make out, from the statements in the French ' Memoire' and 'Contre- Memoire,' what is the law under which it is claimed that French Consuls may grant or renew titres to native vessels. It was stated in the British Case that the Bimaritime law of France does not contemplate the grant of French papers unless at least half the vessel is owned by French citizens. In the '(Jonire- French £&lt; Contre-Memoire ' it is said that this Mdmoire,' p. 16. i aw does not apply to the Colonies, and certain of the laws said to apply to them are given in an Appendix. This statement does not quite accord with the opinion expressed by M. Guy, French Consul at Zanzibar, and quoted at p. 14 of the British Counter-Case. But assuming M. Guy to be wrong and the statement in the ' Contre- Memoire' to be accurate, neither Zanzibar nor Muscat is a French Colony ; and the authority of the Consul, if it exists, must be derived from some general administrative discretion, or from some particular instructions given to him which have not been included in the French ' Memoire ' or &lt;c Contre-Memoire,' or from some law which has not been disclosed. But the Tribunal will find that the litre granted at Aden in 1891 contains a reference to the Law of 27 Vende- miaire, an ii, which is the foundation of the French maritime law and under which half the vessel must be owned by French citizens. It has already been pointed out that Article XXXII of Memoire,' p. 91. the Brussels Act affords no warrant for the grant of titres to native vessels by Consular officers, because the conditions precedent to such grant can be satisfied only in a Colony or Protectorate of the Power which grants the litre. Until copies of the litres granted to the Siiri Arabs now in question are produced, it is not possible to know the statements as to the residence of the owner upon which they were granted. These statements would, in any case, require verification. The grant of protection to individuals is closely linked with the jrancisation of vessels. France appears to contend that the latter turns the captain and crew and their families into French proteges in globo, and that the former has a like effect as to the individual and his descendants. It is not possible to trace in the French 'Memoire ' or ' Contre-Memoire ' any distinct allegation that any of the Omanis in question are French, either as citizens born or as naturalized in French terri tory. It is contended in the French 'Memoire '* ' Contre- and ' Contre-Memoire ' that the terms of Article IV Mdmoire, p, 27. 0 f ^ Treaty of 1844 include not only domestic servants, but also— ' les employes, les commissionnaires, les agents de trans port, tous ceux enfin, en un mot, qui rendent bond fide ' Oontre- Me moire,' pp. 96 et seq. British Case, p. 49. Contre-38 des services pour L'extensioa des relations commerciales, dont le Traits de 1844 a voulu faciliter le d^veloppe- ment.' The contention is obviously wrong. The phrase ' au service ' clearly implies engagement in the capacity of a clerk or domestic or some sub ordinate capacity; and it cannot include all persons with whom Frenchmen happen to have contracts of a commercial nature. In order to ascertain whether any one of the ' boutriers originaires de Mascate ' is entitled to French protection in Muscat, the following pre liminary questions must be asked :— 1. Has he been naturalized in a French posses sion Under the Decree printed at p. 76 of the French ' Memoire ' ? or 2. Was he born in a French possession of a father permanently established there at the date of the birth ? or 3. Is h.Q bond fide in the service of a French citizen ? It would be very difficult- for S iri sailors to satisfy the conditions of three years' unbroken residence in a French Colony required by the Deqree above cited. But even if the answer to questions 1 or 2 were 'Yes,' it would not con clude the matter, for, as has already been pointed out, naturalization abroad is not binding on the State of origin, unless by the laws or the tacit assent of that State the right to alter allegiance is admitted, nor is birth in French territory of foreign parents conclusive of French nationality, and return to and settlement in the country of the father's origin would be a sufficient election not to rely on the accident of birth. France has not supplied, and says that she is not bound to supply, any information whatever as to any of her alleged proteges which would enable the Tribunal to answer any of the above questions. But if the information cannot be supplied her claim to protect fails, and her past interference with the Sultan's authority over such persons stands confessed as an unwarranted interference with his territorial jurisdiction.[733] G THE EFFECT OF ' FRANCISATION.' It is now proposed to consider wliat France claims to be the result, in Oman, of tlie francisation of an Arab dhow owned by an Omani. Consideration has already been given to the French claim of exclusive or concurrent rights to police vessels flying the French flag in Oman waters. But it is also necessary to deal with the effect claimed on land. It is submitted that it is clear beyond all controversy that a grant to a vessel of the right to fly the French flag confers on the owner, master, and crew when on shore no immunity whatever from the jurisdiction of the local Sovereign. M^moire,' p. 28. ^ * S ^ m P oss ^ e to a ^ ow the claim which appears to be put forward by France that the owners and master and crew of any dhow under the French flag are entitled to the same exterritoriality as Frenchmen, and that this privilege extends to the members of their family in direct line. No authority for any such claim has been put forward ; it is opposed to every principle of law.40 CONCLUSION. The facts disclosed in tlie former documents have now been reviewed, and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom with respect to the French claims have been discussed. His Majesty's Government have refrained from contradicting in minute detail all the allegations contained in the French documents, the majority of which appear to them to be irrelevant to the questions at issue, but they are fully prepared to elucidate, by oral or written statement or arguments, or production of further documents, any points as to which the Tribunal may require more light. They venture to submit that the statements and arguments of the British Case and Counter- Case have not been met in any way by those in the French 'Memoire ' and ' Contre-Memoire,' and that they are amply justified in maintaining that the claim of France to protect 1,000 Omani Arabs and their families in their native country from their natural Sovereign is unwarranted by Treaty, usage, or international law, and amounts to an attack on the independence of the Sultan, which is inconsistent with the obligations of France both towards the Sultan and Great Britain. His Majesty's Government submit that a review of all the evidence and documents establishes the correctness of the following propositions, which are the same as those set out in the original British Case :— '1. No subject of the Sultan of Muscat acquires any right to the status of a French protege under the Treaty of 1844 by the fact that he is the owner, captain, or a member of the crew of a native vessel which has, by whatever means, obtained French papers or flag. ' 2. By her adhesion to the XXXIInd Article of the Brussels Act of 1890, France is under an international obligation not to grant French flags or papers to any native vessel unless its owner, at the time of grant, is (a) a French citizen, or is (b) a French protege by reason of his being a subject of a State under French protection. ' 3. France is equally debarred by the Declara tion of 1862 from withdrawing any subject of the41 733] G 2 Sultan of Muscat from tlie jurisdiction of the Sultan by tlie grant of French, flags or papers, and the practice which prevailed up to June 1900 of making such grants trenches on the indepen dence of the Sultan. u 4. No subject of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags, acquires any immunity from the Sultans jurisdiction in the territories or territorial waters of Oman either for himself or for the crew of any ship commanded or owned by him, or for any member of his family or for any of his employes. u 5. On the death of the owner of a vessel in respect of which a French titre de navigation has been granted, no right accrues to his heirs, as such, to treat the vessel as qualified to fly the French flag. The question in each case is one of joersonal status. '6. A titre empowering the flying of the French flag must be granted in respect of a particular vessel, and cannot be used by the holder in respect of any other. u 7. France should, with all reasonable dispatch, erase from her marine registers all native vessels owned by subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and, in co-operation with the Sultan, should take steps to obtain the surrender of all French flags and papers now held by any such subjects. ' 8. In all cases in which France still claims as subject or protege any owner or captain or sailor of an Omani native vessel, she should, with all reasonable dispatch, furnish to the Sultan any proofs on which she claims that such owner or captain or sailor is not a subject of the Sultan, but is a subject or protege of France.'43 APPENDIX 1.

I HAVE already informed you about the vessel belonging to Salim-bin-Mahomed-bin-Taeebj who is under our protection, and the said person applied to me saying that he did not receive from you justice according to the provisions of the Shariat, and did not really accept the compromise made by you in the matter. Now the loss of the buggalow has been fully proved to you, and the injustice which the man has received is obvious; and the Kazi's decision which the oppressor was prevailed upon to accept was for a trifling sum, whereas the vessel was worth 2,000 dollars. 1 therefore now ask you to be good enough to let me know what measure of justice you propose to dispense, and whether you are prepared to oblige the aggressor to pay the value of the dhow which was wrecked. I request an early reply. (Signed) H LARONCE. The above is the translation of the original letter addressed by M. Laronce to the Shaikh of Debai. (Signed) P. Z. COX. Muscat, March 23, 1905. APPENDIX 3. Extract from a Despatch from Mr. Sinclair to the Marquess of Lansdowne. (Extract.) Zanzibar, May 11, 1905. , AN incident has just occurred here which is of interest in that it seems to show that we cannot yet relax the precautions which have been taken in past years for the prevention of slave trading. On the 5th instant Captain Baker-Baker, of His Majesty's ship 'Terpsichore,' the Senior Naval Officer of this station, told me confidentially that he had received reliable information that a dhow called the ' Fath-el-Keir,' sailing under French colours, which had arrived here from Sur in the Persian Gulf on the 22nd ultimo, intended leaving the harbour the following evening. She was then to anchor off a place called Bu-bu-bu, about seven miles north of the port, at which place the nakoda, or captain, had previously arranged with some of the natives that he would call and take on board their cocoanuts, so enabling them to evade the payment of duty. By holdingM out this inducement he hoped to get about twenty-five of them on board, when it was his intention to confine them below deck and set sail on his return voyage to Sur, where it is commonly reported that slaves still fetch from 100 to 200 dollars, that is about 121. to 241. a-piece. Captain Baker-Baker's difficulty lay in the fact that he could not board a dhow flying the. French flag without disobeying his instructions from the Admiralty, and, after consideration, we decided that, although the wisdom of the course was doubtful, yet it seemed to be the only plan to take the French Consul, with whom our relations have lately been of a very friendly nature, into my confidence, and to obtain his consent to the boarding of the vessel. I therefore saw M. Ottavi, who readily promised his co-operation. The next day, howevejr, I received a letter from M. Ottavi stating that he had discovered some irregularities in the dhow's papers which gave him the power of refusing to renew her licence to fly the French flag, but that he had not then decided what action to take. Unfortunately, that morning, i.e., the 6th instant. Captain Baker-Baker received a telegram from the Admiral directing him to proceed at once to Durban, and he was, therefore, compelled to place the matter in my hands, but left his native interpreter behind, so as to keep me supplied with information. Mr. Rogers, whom I then consulted, at once made arrangements to have the dhow followed in case she slipped off in the night, and on the following day M. Ottavi again wrote to say that he had decided to refuse the renewal of the right to fly French colours to the nakoda, thereby forcing him to apply for a Sultan's flag at the Port Office. It was now fairly evident that we must give up hope of catching the slavers red-handed, as there could be no doubt that they were aware that they were objects of suspicion, and I therefore decided that when the nakoda applied for his new papers, it might be as well to examine him. This I accordingly did. His name is Ali-bin-Salim Wateib, and he stated that he was a native of Batna, which is, I understand, an outlying part of Muscat, and that he was a subject of the Sultan of Oman. When asked how it was that he had been sailing under French colours, he said that his father, also a native of Batna, and a Sultan's subject, who had owned the dhow before him, had been in the habit of trading between the Persian Gulf, Zanzibar, Comoro, and Madagascar, and that, having married a Comoro woman, he was there given French protection and a licence to fly the flag. On the death of his father two or three years ago, he had been allowed to retain the licence, although he was not even a son by the Comoro woman. This appears to be a striking instance of the disregard of the Brussels Act which the French authorities have been in the habit of showing,in the issue of their flag to persons who had no claim to it, and there can be little doubt that both the father of Ali-bin-Salim Wateib, who was, I am informed, a well-known slave trader, as well as Ali himself, used the flag thus acquired simply as a protection from interference of British men-of-war. Mr. Rogers has decided to withhold the grant of a provisional licence until the inquiries which he has instituted are completed. It is, of course, much to be regretted that we were unable to effect the capture of the dhow, and make an example of the nakoda and crew, but it may be hoped that their detention here will help to dispel the idea which I hear that the Persian Gulf Arabs seem to hold, that we are no longer on the qui-vive, and that they can therefore revive their old and nefarious ways with impunity. It is, of course, improbable that many slaves are nowadays shipped away from these islands; but as I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my de.spatch No. 31 of the 20th April of last year, it is believed that a certain trade is still done between the Northern Coast of Portuguese East Africa and the Persian Gulf, and the case of kidnapping at Pemba, to which the above- quoted despatch referred) shows that the presence of a man-of-war is still desirable in these waters, especially during the first four or five months, that is from April to August, that the wind blows from the south-west. APPENDIX 4. (A.) M. Cambon to the Marquess of Lansdowne. M. le Marquis, Ambassade de France, Londres, Je 13 Mai, 1904. LES r^cents entretiens que nous avons eus au sujet de la fermeture du Tribunal Consulaire de France k Zanzibar paraissent avoir dissipe les quelques doutes qui subsistaient de part et d'autre sur les consequences exactes de cette mesure, et qui en avaient retarde jusqu'ici 1'execution. Nos deux Gouvernements se trouvent d'accord pour reconnaitre—et cela resulte notamment, en ce qui concerne le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste, des lettres du Marquis de Salisbury en date des 13 Octobre, 1899, et 15 Fevrier, 1900—que la reconnaissance par le Gouvernement de la Republique dans les lies de Zanzibar et de Pemba, ainsi que dans la partie continentale du Sultanat de Zanzibar placee sous le Protectorat Britannique, des Tribunaux Anglais institues par les Ordres en Conseil de 1899, aura pour effet de restreindre a I'avenir les immunites resultant pour les citoyens ou sujets Frangais et les proteges Fra^ais des Articles III et lY du Traits de 1844 entre la France et Mascate, dans la mesure nccessaire a I'administration de la justice par les dits Tribunaux. Le Consul de France ne pourra s'opposer k ce que les actes de procedure r6guli6rement faitsthe Orders in Council of 1899 for the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba and the continental portions of the Sultanate of Zanzibar placed under British protection. I have pleasure in confirming the Agreement thus come to, the terms of which are correctly described in your Excellency's note. His Majesty's Government take note of your statement that it has been decided to close the French Consular Court at Zanzibar on the 15th September next. flis Majesty's Government will make such arrangements as are required on their part for the due execution of those portions of the Agreement which relate to French proteges, and, without entering into the judicial question of the right of the Zanzibar Government to expel the nationals or proteges of foreign Powers by administrative process, they are willing to give an assurance that no such action shall be taken against French citizens or proteges without the concurrence of the French Consul, 1 take note with satisfaction of your Excellency's statement that it is the intention of the French Government to take measures without delay for winding up and closing the French post- office at Zanzibar. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE. APPENDIX 5. Wildenhus Case. ' Homicide was committed in the course of an atfray between two members of the crew of a Belgian ship lying in the port of Jersey City in the United States. A claim was made by the Belgian Consul that the offence was justiciable only under Belgian law, because of the terms of the Convention of the 9th March, 1880, between Belgium and the United States. The controversy was settled in the Supreme Court of the United States by a decision that the offence was justiciable in the State of New Jersey.' (Wildenhus' Case 1887., reported 7 Supreme Court Reporter 385 and 120 U.S. Supreme Court Reports 1.; Below is an extract from the iudgment of Mr. Waite, then Chief Justice of the United States:— ' It is part of the law of civilized nations that, when a merchant-vessel of one country enters the ports of another for the purposes of trade, it subjects itself to the law of the place to which it goes, unless, by Treaty or otherwise, the two countries have come to some different under standing or agreement; for, as was said by Chief Justice Marshall in The Exchange 7 Cranch, 144 ; 'It would be obviously inconvenient and dangerous to society, and would subject the laws to continual infraction and the Government to degradation, if such merchants did not owe temporary and local allegiance, and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of the country.' (United States v. Diekelman 92, U.S. 520; 1 Phillim., 'Int. Law' (3rd Ed.) 483, section 351; Twiss, ' Law Nat.,'229, section 159 ; Creasy, * Int. Law,' 167, section 176; Halleck, 'Int. Law' (1st Ed.), 171.) And the English Judges have uniformly recognized the rights of the Courts of the country of which the port is part to punish crimes committed by one foreigner on another in a foreign merchant-ship. (Reg. v. Cunningham Bell, 'Cr. Cas.,' 72; S.C. 8, Cox, ' Cr. Cas.,' 104; Reg. v. Anderson, 11, Cox, ' Cr. Cas.,' 198, 204; S.C.L.R. 1, 'Cr. Cas.,' 161, 165; Reg. v, Keyn 13, Cox, 'Cr. Cas.,' 403, 486, 525; S.C. 2, Exch. Div., 63, 161, 213.) As the owner has voluntarily taken his vessel, for his own private purposes, to a place within the dominion of a Government other than his own, and from which he seeks protection during his stay, he owes that Government such allegiance, for the time being, as is due for the protection to which he becomes entitled. 'From experience, however, it was found long ago that it would be beneficial to commerce if the local Government would abstain from interfering with the internal discipline of the ship, and the general regulation of the rights and duties of the officers and crew towards the vessel, or among themselves. And so by comity it came to be generally understood among civilized nations that all matters of discipline, and all things done on board, which afiected only the vessel, or those belonging to her, and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country, or the tranquillity of the port, should be left by the local Government to be dealt with by the authorities of the nation to which the vessel belonged as the laws of that nation, or the interests of its commerce, should require. But if crimes are committed on board of a character to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the country to which the vessel has been brought, the offenders have never, by comity or usage, been entitled to any exemption from the operation of the local laws for their punishment, if the local tribunals see fit to assert their authority. Such being the general public law on this subject. Treaties and Conventions have been entered into by nations having commercial intercourse, the purpose of which was to settle and define the rights and duties of the Contracting Parties with respect to each other in these particulars, and thus prevent the inconvenience that might arise from attempts to exercise conflicting jurisdictions.'47 APPENDIX 0. DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE CASE OF SALIM-B1N-SE1F. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Salisbury. (Extract.) Zanzibar, June 17, 1898. I HAVE the honour to traTisrait herewith correspondence respecting the case of Salim-bin-Seif, a Peraba slave-trader, who, after long baffling the vigilance of the authorities, has at last been caught in the act of shipping slaves from that island by Captain Goldie-Taubman's police, and whom the French Consulate claims to protect. This Salim is the man referred to in my despatch No. 166 of the 6th instant. I should explain that the main coiTespondence was carried on by the French Consul with Brigadier-Greneral Raikes, and that it was only on failing to obtain satisfaction from the latter that he applied to me. Since my note to him of the 10th instant he has not again addressed me on the subject. Your Lordship will be able to judge from the inclosed papers of the validity of the grounds on which M. Laronce tries to show that Salim-bin-Seif was entitled to ex-territorial immunities as a ' French-protected person.' It is sufficient to say that in previous cases of a similar nature, such as those of Sheikh Abdullah, of Patta, Abdullah-bin-Selam, and others, these reasons have been dismissed by your Lordship as insufficient, and the claimants summarily dealt with as local subjects'. The present case has, however, excited considerable interest among the Pemba Arabs, and our success in stamping out the export Slave Trade from Pemba will be greatly affected by its solution. n ^ No reply having been received up to date from M. Laronce, the Court, composed of Greneral Raikes and the Arab Cadi, Sheikh Burhan-bin-Abdul Aziz, pronounced judgment on the prisoner this morning. An English translation of this judgment is inclosed herewith. I have told General Raikes to send a copy of the judgment to M. Laronce, and to inform him at the same time that the French flags and papers found on the convict's dhows will be duly returned to the French Consulate. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. M. Laronce to Sir A.

[733J H48 Inclosure 2 in No, 1. Sir A. Hardinge to M. Laronce, (Translation.) 8ir, Zanzibar, June 8,1898. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of to-day's date, on the subject of Salim-bin-Seif. I have just had a conversation as to this matter with General Raikes. You are aware that a difference of opinion has for a long time past existed between our two Governments respecting the question of the conditions which justify the registration as French proteges ot persons who could not claim that character in virtue of their origin, or of the text of the Treaties. The correspondence which has passed between Her Majesty's Agency and your predecessors on the cases (to cite only a few) of Sheikh Abdullah, of Salim-bin-Abderahman, and of Salim-bin-AH Ei Eiani, indicates clearly enough the principles on which our view of this question rests, and I am therefore unable to admit that the mere fact of Salim-bin-Seif's being entered on your registers, or of the presence on board his dhows of a French flag, is sufficient of itself to withdraw him from the jurisdiction to which he naturally belongs. I have accordingly recommended General Raikes, before taking any further step, to inquire from you as to the date and place at which the prisoner was registered, the authority which granted, and the grounds which led to, his registration. Should these particulars establish the right of Salim-bin-Seif to French protection, I will request the local Government to surrender him to you to be tried before your Court. So far his examination has elicited no reason which would warrant such a measure, for although he states that he was born (of an Arab father) in the Comoro Islands, he left, on his own showing, that territory nearly fifty years ago, and therefore at a period long anterior to the establishment of the French protectorate. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE Inclosure 3 in No. 1. M. Laronce to Sir A. Hardinge. M. I'Agent et Consul-General, Zanzibar, le 9 Juin, 1898. VOUS m'avez fait I'honneur de m'adresser le 8 de ce mois une lettre au sujet de I'affaire Selim-bin-Seif. Vous constatez que nos deux Gouvernements professent une opinion differente sur la question de nationalite des personnes qui se reclament aujourd'hui de la protection fran9aise. U semble que la consideration de ce seul fait, d'echange de vues entre Paris et Londres k ce sujet, devait suffire a arreter le Premier Ministre de Sa Hautesse par interim dans I'application d'une mesure qu'il ne saurait encore justifier. Ainsi que je I'ai fait remarquer ce jour meme au General Raikes, I'enquete k laquelleil se livre vis-k-vis de ce Consulat, apr&amp;s les assurances contenues dans ma lettre du 7 courant, n'est point d'une correction absolue au point de vue des regies de la courtoisie internationale. Aucun Consulat etranger, a ce que je crois, ne saurait repondre a une pareille exigence de la part des autorites locales en ce qui concerne une question d'ordre int&amp;ieur. J'ai rappele egalement au General Raikes qu'en Aout 1897, lorsque le ' Majunga,' appartenant au meme proprietaire, fut arrets par Mr. Farler dans les eaux de Pemba, Sir Lloyd Mathews avait partage a I'^gard de la nationalite de S61im-bin-Seif une opinion tout a fait contraire a celle qu'il prof esse aujourd'hui. J'ai signal^ au Premier Ministre par interim de Sa Hautesse la contradiction qui existe actuellement entre son administration et celle du titulaire du poste qu'il occupe maintenant. Enfin, en dernier lieu, il y a la une grave atteinte portee au pavilion derriere lequel s'est abrit£ jusqu'ici Selim-bin-Seif, centre laquelle je proteste ; je reitere mes plus expresses reserves, au nom de mon Gouvernement, quant aux suites de I'incident qu'a cru devoir soulever le General Raikes. Je profite, &amp;c. (Sign£) R. LARONCE.49 Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge, to M. Laronce. (Translation.) „ ^ g- r Zanzibar, June 10, 1898. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of yesterdays date, and of the protest contained in it in the matter of Salim-bin-Seif. I cannot admit that the request made to you by General Raikes was not a proper one trom the point of view of the rules of international courtesy. A Pemba Arab, to all appearance a local subject, is arrested for an act oi slave irade. He admits having been, until quite recently, a Sultan's subject, but states that he received some time ago, on his simple application and without the authorization _ of the local Government, French protection and a French Hag. No Government can recognize the right ot a foreign Consulate to withdraw one of its subjects from its jurisdiction without even deigning to intorm it of the reason for which it claims to do so. If in France a British Consul were to demand that a person who was to all appearance a French citizen, and was born and domiciled in French territory, should be exempted from military service because he was registered as a British subject on the Consular registers, the French authorities would, I think, before granting this demand, require to be informed of the circumstances on account of which he had been so registered, and should the British Consul refuse to state them, would reject it. Such a proceeding on their part would certainly appear to me a very natural one, and could not be criticized as improper, llie German Consulate, for example, with which we have frequently had differences of this kind, has never, so far as I am aware, made any difficulty about stating its grounds for recognizing a particular person as a subject or protdge of Germany. • • jv . I have asked General Raikes if Sir L. Mathews had expressed last year the opinion that Salim was de jure a French-protected person. He has replied that this question was not at that time examined. When Salim's dhow was detained last year by Archdeacon i arler, the question was not whether Salim was, or was not, a French-protected person, but whether there were sufficiently serious reasons for suspecting him to be engaged in the Slave Trade to justify his arrest and that of liis vessel The Government decided that there was not sufficient evidence to authorize such a measure, and the dhow was accordingly set at liberty. _ - j j In the Ccise now before us tli€/ proofs were sufficient to cftiise feciiiin to be O/rrestecl, ctncl General Raikes was thus obliged to enter upon the question of jurisdiction which his predecessor had not had to decide. ^ ^ i I should add that the alleged birth of Salim-bm-Seif in the Comoros is denied by several Arab witnesses from Pemba, who declared him to be a native of that island. His case seems, m fact, to be absolutely similar to those of Sheikh Abdullah, of Patta, and of Abdullah-bin-Selam, who, though registered as French-protected persons, were, nevertheless, by the order of Her ■■ J ■' 1 1 i as local subjects.

I AM in receipt of your despatch dated the 11th June, and I acknowledge, with many thanks, your reasons for claiming Salim-bin-Seif as a French protege; but as regards his being born in Comoro, he himself says he was; but I have heard from other Pemba Arabs that he was born in Pemba. But this matters little, as at the time of his birth, which he says was about forty-five years ago, the French had not annexed the island, and therefore it can make very little material difference. As regards his having bought the dhow ' 8elamti' at Mayotte and himself being registered there, it seems a mistake, as he himself says the ' Selamti' never belonged to him, but &gt; to SaHm-bin-Ali, and that he was captain or sailor in her for four years; but as to that being true, it would hardly make Salim-bin-Seif a French protege, as, I believe, it has been decided in London before, that buying a house in Comoro does not allow the buyer to claim French protection, therefore, I suppose, likewise a dhow, also before the time of annexation; but this is immaterial, as Salim-bin-Seif says he never did own the ' Selamti.' I have referred your letters to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-Gen era!, and he concurs with me that as yet there are no grounds for handing Salim-bin-Seif over to yonr Court. As regards the case of the f&lt; Majunga ' last year, I believe it was not liberated on account of nationality, but as Mr. Farler could not clearly prove his case as to the shipment ot slaves, the matter was allowed to drop and the dhow liberated, and I don't think Salim was produced in your Court for slave-dealing, the case not being continued with: therefore I do not think Sir Lloyd Mathews had any correspondence as regards the nationality of Salim-bin-Seif. 1 have no wish to keep Salim-bin-Seif after you have fully satisfied myself and Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General with regard to his nationality to our satisfaction, I have, &amp;c. (Signed) A. E. RAIKES, Acting Prime Minister. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Judgment on Salim-hin- Seif. SALIM-BIN-SEIF, you have claimed French protection, but as you have not proved your self such to my satisfaction, about which I will give my reasons later, I have proceeded with the case of slave-dealing against you, and am now going to pronounce judgment. The evidence ot all the slaves (seven) you have heard, and also of Nahotha Bakari and the two Askaris, and also of Nasoro-bin-Ali. Their evidence all more or less coincides. They (the slaves) say they were caught by Mwambieni and Mwabruki, acting Nahotha for you, taken to the beach at Kinzu, and shipped in a small dhow and taken and landed at Ndunne in a (i dug-out' with Mwambieni, where they met you, and were taken into some mangroves by you; later they saw Nahotha Bakari, who told them they were going: to be shipped, and had better run away. Then they say Askaris came and caught them, and that you were there; that the Askaris pointed their rifles at you, and you said, ' Don't shoot me, I am Salirn,' and than you went away. Some of the slaves say they know you well. Then the evidence of the Askaris is that they were sent for, as some slaves were going to be shipped; they, and also a witness named Athman, hid in the bushes, saw and heard you hail a 'dug-out,' and the men in the 'dug-out' hailed back; you then beckoned to the slaves to follow you, when they (the Askaris) jumped at and caught the slaves. Pointing their rifles at you, you said, 'Don't shoot me, I am Salim.' Their reason for not arresting you was, that they both knew you well, and could catch you any time, and had plenty of witnesses, and were doubtful whether they had the right, owing to having heard in the island that you were a French protege; also, they all have recognized the dhow as yours. Nasoro-bin-Ali's evidence, as to your former character, was, he said, that many people—in fact, every one in Pemba—knew you as a slave-dealer; Nahotha Bakari also says he heard you bargaining as to a number of slaves with Nasoro-bin-Rashid. Therefore, on this evidence, which you have heard. Sheikh Barhan, Government Kathi, and myself, have gone into it, and have found you guilty of slave-dealing, in that you have been caught in the act of trying to ship slaves, and none of them belonging to you; therefore we sentence you to one year's rigorous imprisonment. Now, as regards your being a French protege, you say you were born in Comoro about forty-live years ago, that you have no property there and never had, and your reason for being a French protege is, you say, because you have dhows carrying the French flag, which you52 Selim-bin-Seif et son Equipage, ainsi que les deux boutres saisis, soient remis a notre Agent a Zanzibar, a qui il appartient de proceder aux mesures d'instruction requises, et de renvoyer, le cas echeant, les prevenus devant I'autorite fran^aise competente. Veuillez, &amp;c. (Sigue) GEOFFRAY, No. 4. J he Marquess of Salisbury to Baron de Courcel. Your Excellency, Foreign Ojffice^ 'November 12, 1898. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of M, Geoftray's note of the 16th ultimo respecting the case of Salim-bin-Seif. M. Geoffray, in claiming the surrender of this person to the French Consul at Zanzibar, lays stress upon the fact that the papers originally handed to him at Mayotte were registered at the French Consulate at Zanzibar as long ago as 1889, and that since that date Salim has made repeated voyages to Madagascar and elsewhere in vessels owned by him and ostensibly under the protection of the French flag. Her Majesty's Government cannot,-however, admit that the French Consul, by merely regis tering a subject of Zanzibar as a French-protected person, is able to withdraw him from the jurisdiction of the Tribunals of his natural Sovereign; nor can they assent to the view that he ought to be considered as having been so withdrawn simply because he sailed in vessels which were permitted by the French authorities, though with what justification does not at present appear, to fly the French flag. There is nothing, indeed, to show that Salim ever had the Sultan of Zanzibar's permission to register either himself or the ships as being under French protection. M. Geoffray further adduces the conduct of the Zanzibar authorities on the occasion of the arrest by Mr. Farler last year of Salim's dhow as a proof that the man's personal status is now beyond controversy. t [ have, however, to observe that on that occasion the question was not whether balim was a French-protected person, but whether there were sufficiently serious reasons for suspecting him to be engaged in the Slave Trade to justify his arrest and that of the vessel. The Zanzibar Government decided that there was not sufficient evidence to authorize such a measure, and the dhow was accordingly set at liberty. In the case under discussion, however, the proofs were enough to cause Salim to be arrested, and it then became necessary to enter upon the question of jurisdiction. 1 inclose a copy of the judgment pronounced in the case. Your Excellency will perceive that Salim-bin-Seif declared that he was a subject of the Sultan except during the period when he was in command of a dhow belonging to a man alleged to be a French-protected person. But the fact of Salim having taken such service could not even temporarily divert elsewhere the allegiance which he owed to the Sultan of Zanzibar. Her Majesty's Government therefore remain of opinion that Salim is a subject of Zanzibar, and are unable to find anything in the facts alleged which in any degree cancels his allegiance to the Government of that country. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) SALISBURY. No. 5. The Marquess of Salisbury to Sir A. Hardinge. gj r Foreign Office, December 14, 1898. ' THE attention of Her Majesty's Government has been called by several cases which have occurred during recent years to the serious inconvenience occasioned to the Administration ot the Sultanate of Zanzibar by the grant of French protection to natives who do not appear to be entitled to it, either by the Treaty between France and Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, which regulates the relations of France to Zanzibar, or by the other Treaties with Zanzibar, to the benefit of which France is entitled under the operation of the most-favoured-nation clause in her own Treaty. • a • i The Treaty between France and Muscat contains the following Articles :— &lt; i -i i ' Article ID. Les Francis auront la faculte d'acheter, de vendre, ou de prendre a bail des terres, maisons, magasms, dans les liltats de Son Altesse le Sultan de Mascate.^ Nul ne pouna, sous aucun pretexte, penetrer dans les maisons, magasins, et autres propnetes, possedes ou occupes par des Fim^ais ou par des personnes au service des FranQais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de I'occupant, a moins que ce ne soit avec I'intervention du Consul de France. ' Les Fran9ais ne pourront, sous aucun pr^texte, etre retenus contre leur volont6 dans les Etats du Sultan de Mascate. . , ' Article IV. Les sujets de Son Altesse le Sultan de Mascate qui seraient au service des Fran^ais jouiront de la meme protection que les Francjais eux-memes; mais si les sujets de bon53 Altesse sont convaincus de qnelque crime ou infraction punissable par la loi, ils seront cong^dies par les Fran^ais an service desquels ils se tronvent, et livres aux antorites locales.' It thus appears that the only native persons who can, in virtue of the provisions of the Treaty regulating the relations between France and Zanzibar, claim French protection or fly the French flag on their dhows are :— 1. Natives of French Protectorates, who were there resident, or, at least, were not resident in Zanzibar when the said Protectorates were established ; and 2. The hondfide servants of French citizens and proteges; the local authority to be judge of what constitutes bond fide service. The Treaty excludes, therefore,from French protection all persons not born in French possessions or dependencies, though they may have acquired land there and have been inscribed on the French Consular Register at Zanzibar or Muscat. The officers of the Administration of the Sultanate have therefore a right to decline to recognize exterritorial privileges to native vessels flying the French flag until satisfied that the owner is a hond fide citizen or protege of France. It would not be nepessary, in order to act on this principle, to board or search the vessel under the French flag, but in any case in which the Administration had reason to believe that the flag was being improperly hoisted, the master, when he came on shore, would be called upon to produce his papers, and prove that he was a French protege in the sense which I have indicated in this despatch. If he refused to produce his papers, he would be arrested. In such matters, it would he proper for the officers of the Administration to be guided by the rinciples of the Ottoman Nationality Law, which has been accepted in Turkey by the foreign owers, and may, therefore, be assumed to contain nothing contrary to the due exercise of the privileges of exterritoriality. Under that law, a native of the Ottoman Empire is presumed to be an Ottoman subject until he has proved that he is not one according to the law in question, the onus probandi lying, not on the territorial authority, but on the person claiming the privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction. It will be observed in reference to the French Treaty with Muscat (and, indeed, with reference to the Zanzibar Treaties generally) that it speaks only of French citizens or persons in the service of French citizens; the Administration of the Sultanate may therefore refuse, as the Porte has always done, to recognize Tunisians and natives of Comoro as entitled to the benefits of the Treaty. All the more may those benefits be refused to persons who are not even natives of French Protectorates, notwithstanding that they may at one time or other have been improperly allowed the status of French prot^g^s. I authorize you to act, in any cases that may arise in the future, on the principles indicated in my present despatch. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) SALISBURY. No. 6. M.

M.

Le fait de la naissance de Selim-bin-Seif a la Grande Comore est, d'ailleurs, connu des autontes Zanzibarites. D'apres une lettre adressee a M.

La comparaison du rapport de M. Taillet avec le texte de la sentence rendue centre Selim- bin-Seif montre d'ailleurs que d'autres points appellent des eclaircissements. Ainsi, par exemple le jugement enregistre que Selim ne possederait actuellement, et n'aurait jamais possede, de propriety a la Grande Comore. D'apr&amp;s notre agent, Selim, an moment on il a ete autorise a porter nos couleurs, aurait (He proprietaire d'une maison, non, il est vrai, a la Grande Comore mais dans une possession franyaise toute voisine, a Nossi-Be. , .'^ a liberation prochaine de Selim-bin-Seif permettra 4 M.

BEFORE the Sultanate of Zanzibar came under the Protectorate of Her Majesty in 1890 the nrotection by foreign Powers of individuals living in His Highness dominions was exercised without reference fo any very strict code of rules. To this state of things must no doubt be •ittributed the relatively large number of cases in which, since the establishment of .he British Protectorate particular persons have received or have claimed the protection of Emopean Powers in circumstances which did not appear to Her Majesty s Government to warrant the withdrawal of such persons from the Sultan's jurisdiction. Many of these cases have foimed the subiect of correspondence between Her Majesty's Government and foreigm Governments and between theii' U^resentatives in Zanzibar. Some cases have been settled by compromise, and not always in accordance with the strict interpretation of the rules which should have govern fhpm • others are still pending or have settled themselves by efflux ot time.

From the evidence that Mr. Sinclair has been able to obtain, in one case from an eye-witness, there appears to be little doubt that Salim was actually born in the Island of Pemba, and this fact, unless it can be disproved, will finally dispose of his claims to French protection.

Vice-Consul Sinclair to Mr. Cave. g| r Chaki-Chaki, Pemba, October 25, 189&amp; I HAVE the honour to submit the following report with reference to the case of Salim-bm- Saif, which, in accordance with your verbal instructions, I have made the subject of special Your information that he is now in Government employ is without foundation, and Captain Taubmann. whom I consulted, and who gave mo very great assistance in collecting evidence as to his parentage, was of opinion that it would be unwise to interview Selim (or Msellim, as ms correct name seems to be), as he is known to be still antagonistic to the Government, and it might lead him to attach importance to his case. i , , Inquiries, however, which I made at Weti leave little room for doubt that he was not, as he stated, born at Comoro, but here in Pemba. An M'Pemba, named Hamis-bin-Said, whose evidence I first obtained, stated that he had known Msellim-bin-Saif all his life, having been brought up in the same village with him ; his mother, who died about three years ago, was, he said, a r emba woman, named Binti Ali, the daughter of Ali-bin-Suliman, of Kinyazini a place just south o Weti. She married a Muscat Arab named Saif who settled at Pemba, and this witness is willing to swear that Binti Ali never left Pemba, and that Msellim was born there. An old Arab named Abdulla-bin-Salem-bin-Abdulla of Kwimone confirmed the above evidence, and added that he remembered the marriage taking place here. I inclose his written statement that Msellnn was born in Pemba. This witness, on being asked if he had ever heard that Msellim possessed property elsewhere, said that he had heard that Saif, Msellim's father, had married a woman of Gazija (Comoro), who possessed property there. &gt; &gt; i ^ r • u j The most direct and convincing proof as to Msellim's birthplace is, however, that turmsned by Selimah-binti-Juma-bin-Suliman, who was examined by one of the native ofiicers. Captain Simba; this woman is a cousin of Msellim's mother, whose name she says was Bisharah-binti-Ali- bin-Suliman, who was born at Pemba, her mother being a native Pemba girl; Selimah states that she was actually present at the birth of Msellim-bin-Saif, which took place at Chavom, and that he had one brother, who died in infancy, and a sister whose mother was a Suria named raida. Another witness, Khamis-bin-Saif, declared that there was a third son named Mahomed-bm-bait by a wife from Gazija (Comoro). i- i j i x 4.1. + In view of this evidence, which is amply confirmed by others, there can be little doubt that Msellim-bin-Saif only assumed false nationality, and so obtained French protection in 01 dei to more safely carry on his well-known malpractices in slave-trading, to which their nag has unfortunately acquired the undesirable reputation of affording an effective screen in these wateis— a reputation which his punishment has, so I am informed, done much among the natives 01 this island to eradicate.

THE COUNTEE-CASE ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY. LONDON : PRINTED AT THE FOEEIGN OFFICE, BY HAKRISON AND SONS, PRINTERS IN ORDINARY TO HIS MAJESTY.[530] MUSCAT DHOWS ARBITRATION. THE COUNTER-CASE ON BEHALF 03? THE GOVERNMENT OE HIS BEITANNIO MAJESTY. I—PEELIMINAEY OBSERVATIONS. THE French Government has taken exception to the appearance of the name of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on the title page of the British Case as a party to the present arbitration, and to the insertion of the statement at the end of p. 4 of the British Case—that His Majesty's Govern- Appendix l p 39. m ent were acting at the request of His Highness. Although they regard this protest as of a purely technical character, His Majesty's Go vernment, in deference to the desire of the French Government, have agreed to treat as deleted the words objected to. But in making this concession His Majesty's Government re serve all their rights under the Anglo French Declaration of 1862, and the Compromis of the 13th October, 1901-, to assert in the fullest sense the independence and sovereignty of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, and to submit o 7 evidence and arguments in proof of the allega tion that that independence is menaced by the claim of France to take subjects of Muscat under her protection. And it must also be Appendix 2, p. 40. distinctly stated that the arguments in the British Case are presented on behalf of His Highness the Sultan, who has spontaneously expressed his wish to have his case presented by His Majesty's Government. Finally, His Majesty's Government submit that the whole of their policy has been directed to strengthening and consolidating the position of the Sultan of Muscat as an independent Sovereign; that they have not sought to obtain from him a lease of territory; that they have not attempted in any way to exercise any jurisdiction over his subjects ashore or in the territorial waters of Muscat; and that, in fact, all their dealings with His Highness have been upon the basis of his independence.II.—GENEEAL EXAMINATION OE THE EHENCH CASE. In dealing with the Case presented to the Tribunal by the Erench Government, it is some what difficult to disentangle the relevant from the irrevelant portions of that Case. At the outset it is well to premise that (as stated in the second recital of the Compromis) the assistance French Case, of the Tribunal is asked to settle difficulties British Case, which have arisen as to the scope of the Declaration of 1362 ' in relation to the issue by the Erench Republic to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers autho rizing them to fly the Erench flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness, who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers, or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, and especially as to the manner in which such immunities and privileges affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his subjects.' A very considerable portion of the Erench Case is taken up with an attack on the supposed policy of Great Britain in the Indian Ocaan, and in the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, and with suggestions that Great Britain has in various ways violated the Declaration of 1S62 and the independence of Oman. His Majesty's Government must protest against the introduction of these accusations into the Erench Case. They relate entirely to matters of a political rather than of a juridical nature, which are not included in the terms. of the Compromis, and it cannot be maintained that they in any degree affect the real issues upon which the decision of the Tribunal is sought. His Majesty's Government are, however, pre pared to answer these accusations seriatim, not withstanding their irrelevance, after dealing with those portions of the Erench Case which are relevant and material. The Government of His Majesty would also observe that the Declaration of 18G2, while it imposes on the High Contracting Parties re ciprocal obligations to respect the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, in noway debars either Party from pursuing its own advantages and furthering the interests of its own subjects trading in the Sultan's dominions, providing that it does not in the pursuance of these objects impair the independence of His Highness; and that so far as bond fide trade and commerce is concerned, the interests of both Great Britain and France are safeguarded by the most-favoured-nation clauses in tire Treaties of 1814 and 1891 (which are quoted in the British Case, pp. 6-9). The difference in the position of the two countries in Muscat lies mainly in the fact that Great Britain has large trade interests in Oman, and that many traders from India and other parts of the British Empire are settled there. On the other hand, the trade and trade interests of France are small, her subjects there settled are few, and the functions of her Consular Agent appear to be political rather than commercial, not excepting his action with respect to the Omanis, whose possession of French flags and papers has led to this arbitration. The French version of the course of events which has led to the present dispute is the first, as it is the only, material part of the French Memoire. It begins (p. 6) with a statement that France lias always abstained from interference in the internal affairs of Oman, and has never sought by indirect means or special compacts to evade her promises. But the gist of the British Case and the ground of the complaints made by His Highness the Sultan are that in regard to the important matter of Omani vessels carrying the French fla&lt;? the action of IVance has trenched on the independence of the Sultan and on his authority over his own subjects, and that the description of Siir (in the French Case, p. 44) as semi-independent, so far as it is warranted by fact, is a description of the effect produced on the Sultan's independence and authority by the action of France with respect to the seafaring population of that town. It is as impossible for His Majesty's Govern ment to dissociate themselves from the acts of their Agents in Oman and of the authorities in India, who are specially intrusted with safeguarding British interests in Arabia and Persia, as it is for the French Government to dissociate themselves from the acts of French officials with reference to the francisation of Omani vessels and the pro tection of Omanis in Oman from their natural4 Sovereign. It lias already been stated (British Case, p. 13) that His Highness sought the advice of Great Britain as to the inter national correctness of the action of Prance in the francisation of dhows belonging to his subjects, and having their home port and the real residence of their owners within his territory. It is stated in one part of the Erench Case that the Sultan's first complaint was made in 1897 (p. 6) ; and elsewhere (p. 24), that he began to complain in 1895; but if His Highness did not make his objections directly to Prance before these dates, his silence was not the result of his own impulse, but of British advice. Between 1892 and 1897, the British Government had understood from certain statements by French Ministers and officials (which are detailed at pp. 12-15 of the British Case) that Erance was discontinuing wholly or in part the francisation of Siiri dhows. But in fact the practice had not ceased, and the consequent evils became so serious in Oman that the Sultan, in May 1897, addressed a protest on this subject to the Erench Consul at Muscat (sec British Case, pp. 65-67). It will be seen that this protest was prior to the letter of the British Consul, dated the 18th October, 1897, to which reference is made at p. 6 of the Erench Case. Erom May 1897 until 1903 both the Sultan and the British Government con tinuously and consistently objected to the Erench practice as trenching on the sovereign rights of the Sultan, and these protests are given in detail in the British Case (pp. 15-18), though passed over lightly in the Erench Case (see pp. 6 and 7), in which Great Britain is represented as urging the Sultan, on insufficient pretexts and against his will, to attack what are styled the legitimate claims of France. It will be interesting to compare the full, British Case, complete, and exact statement in the British pp ' Case with reference to the events of 1903, which led to the present arbitration, with the scanty and indefinite allusions made to it in the Erench Case, in which the only reference made to these important facts is a statement that three dhow- owners, who were Erench proteges, were arrested French Case, p. 7. and arbitrarily imprisoned.III.—AEAB SHIPPING. His Majesty's Government have no quarrel with the definition of ' boutre ' given at p. 9 of the Erench Case, but venture to refer the Tribunal to the definition given in Article XXXI of the 'Brussels Act:— ' La qualification de batiment indigene s'applique aux navires qui remplissent- une des deux conditions sui- vantes:— '1. Presenter les signes ext^rieurs d'une construction ou d'un greement indigene; ' 2. litre months par un Equipage dont lie capitaine et la majorite des matelots soient originaires d'un des pays baignes par les eaux de FOc^an Indien, de la Mer Eouge, ou du Golfe Persique.' The Omani dhows in question in this Case all fall within both of the conditions indicated by the Article. These vessels, as stated in the Erench Case, are largely concerned in oversea trade in the Indian Ocean, and this trade has been carried on for many centuries, probably long before a European vessel visited these seas. But their owners have also from time im memorial been largely concerned in the Slave Trade, which is far more profitable than ordinary and legitimate commerce. The inhabitants of Siir have had for many years an unenviable but well-earned reputation as the most notorious slave traders in the Indian Ocean, and so lately as 1902 the Portuguese Government captured over 100 of them in Mozambique, with their vessels, and with slaves ready for shipment. Great Britain has never had any occasion to protest against or interfere with any form of lawful trade, for the policy of Great Britain for generations has been to encourage free trade in all seas and ports, and it is to a very great extent due to her efforts that piracy and slave trading have been reduced to a minimum in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, and that the trade in these seas has been opened to the lawful commerce of all nations. It is common ground that numerous Arab6 families have sought to obtain the benefits of the French flag on the high seas and even in the waters of their own Sovereigns. Their reason for this desire does not arise from any wish to engage in lawful commerce, in which Great Britain is at least as anxious as Prance to encourage them, being as fully as any nation an advocate of free commerce in all lawful merchan dize. The description given on pp. 9-16 of the procedure of the French Consular and Colonial authorities with respect to the grant of the French flag to Arab vessels calls for certain comments. It is clear from the admitted necessity of issuing and renewing the strongest instructions for greater and greater care in the grant of French papers that France was conscious of the difficulty of ensuring that her flag would not be obtained by unqualified Arabs, and would not be abused if obtained. But the suggestion made (on pp. 10, 11) that to carry the French flag was the Arab mode of insuring personal security for Arabs, means, if it means anything, that the British authorities were disposed to act op pressively towards vessels under the Arab flag; whereas the sole ground for interference with such vessels was their carrying slaves, and the real motives for carrying the French flag on vessels not concerned in 'cabotage' between French ports were that France, in 1845, denounced the Anglo-French Treaties of 1831 and 1833 giving mutual rights of search for detection and suppression of the Slave Trade; that she has since that date continually held out against the grant of such right of search ; and that she has thus far failed to ratify the Articles of the Act of Brussels dealing with that subject. The date assigned in the French Case (p. 10) for the earliest francisa- tion of an Arab dhow is 1845—the year of the denunciation of the Treaties just referred to. With the denial of the right to search vessels under the French flag came the grant of that flag to a class of vessels most calling for search, and owmed by persons who were not French. It was perfectly natural and proper for Franco to take steps to control vessels engaged in local trade between her own Colonies, and to adopt measures relaxing to some extent the strictness of her own maritime laws as to the conditions on which vessels might receive French papers.7 French Caso, p. 15. His Majesty's Government quite agree with the Prench Government that the flag may properly he given to natives of Prench Colonies or of Preneh Protectorates, and this view has already been ex pressed at p. 24 of the British Case. Moreover, no question arises in the present arbitration as to the possession of Prench papers by Arab vessels outside the territorial waters oF Oman ; nor does His Majesty's Government ask the Tribunal to deal with the case of any Arabs, except subjects of Muscat, who are found within the territory or the territorial waters of His Highness the Sultan. With reference to Zanzibaris who fly the Prench flag (Prench Case, p. 15), it is not necessary to say more than that such persons appear not to be subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, owing to the severance of Zanzibar from Muscat in 1856, but that their independence of His Highness does not qualify them to become Prench proteges in Muscat, and that their status in Oman would seem to be that of proteges of Great Britain and subjects of the Sultan of Zanzibar. In the Prench Case it is sought to found an argument on the statement that a practice insti tuted in 1845 was allowed to go on without protest until 1897. French Case, p. 31. Great Britain has continually sought to induce Prance to withdraw her flag from Arab vessels; but the objections taken to its use were its abuse for the purposes of the Slave Trade, which have been the subject of innumerable and well- founded reports by British cruisers in the Indian Ocean. It is very likely that in many cases the flag was used without? the authority of any Prench officer, but often slavers had regular Prench papers. The Prench cruisers in the Indian seas were by no means numerous enough, to insure adequate surveillance over the many Arabs who chose to hoist Prench colours; and it is to be observed that while credit is taken at p. 32 of the Prench Case for severe punishment said to have been inflicted in one case of slave- trading under the Prench flag, no mention is made of the fact that the capture of the vessels in question was not due to Prench effort, but to the visdlance of a British cruiser off the Appendix 3, p. 41 j coast of Oman, that the Prench officials made a very violent protest against this action, and that the punishment inflicted was very far from severe or deterrent, seeing that sentence was awarded on the 28th August, 1897, and that the captains [530] C8 of the vessels were released on the 18th January, p - 1898, at the request of the French Consul. Whatever concessions or usages there may- have been in favour of the French practice on the part of the Sultan of Zanzibar before 1890, this does not affect the distinct Sultanate of Muscat, and there does not appear to be any record before 1891 of any protection by France in Oman of any native ship-owners. Before 1891 the objections of Great Britain related to the abuse of the French flag on the high seas, and, ix naturally, did not apply to its use in the territorial waters of other Powers or in British waters, the . » flag in such positions being unavailing against the territorial Sovereign. But the passing of the Act of Brussels in 1890 marks a distinct stage in the question of the francisation of native vessels. The provisions of that Act, which were accepted by France in 1892 (see British Case, pp 10-14), imposed a new obligation on France, and appear to make it unnecessary to go into detail as to the legality and regularity of the French practices said to have been in vogue before that date. though all rights to contest such validity are hereby fully reserved. Q So far back as 1891 the Sultan found that the use of French flags by his subjects at Siir was interfering with his authority. He consulted the British Government, and buffer their dissuasion p 57 _ would have then lodged his protest with the French Government; and, as already stated in the British Case, pp. 12 and 53, His Majesty's Government called the attention of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs to the existence of this abuse. Moreover, it will be seen from the document presented at p. 58 of the British Case (No. 10), that the Wali of Siir had, so early as ^ 1891, received orders to require Siiri ship captains to return their French flags. These protests arose immediately out of the policv adopted by France on her partial accept ance of the Brussels Act. According to the statements in the French Case, instead of taking the opportunity of their qualified adhesion to the Act to clear tbeir registers of Omani vessels, the French Govern ment, in 1894 j , set to work to register all vessels previously francises, regardless of the question whether they were qualified for registration ^ under the Brussels Act (French Case, p. 13). They sent a Consul to Muscat, and the courseof action adopted by liim there, presumably on instructions, was no longer to send the vessels annually to a ^French port where they could be carefully examined, but to make Muscat the homo port of the vessels in question. The policy thus adopted intensified the mischief complained of. At this point it becomes necessary to analyze the reasons given for granting the French flag to Omanis. France claims the position of defendant in this arbitration. The exact object of this course is not clear; it may be to avoid formu lating a definite claim, or it may be to compel Great Britain to prove in the first instance the accuracy and justice of the complaints of the Sultan and Great Britain as to the effect of the French policy. But if France is on her defence she must deny, justify, explain, or excuse. To see how far any of these pleas will avail, one must examine the French contentions. The list in the French Case (p. 58) of owners of Muscat dhows with French flags shows that France does not deny that Omanis have French flags. How is that justified, excused, or ex plained ? It is faintly suggested that some may have been denationalized, as having definitely settled down in French territory or emigrated sine animo French Case, p. 10. revertendi. But the Sultan of Muscat does not allow his subjects to abjure their allegiance— in this respect following the rule which in earlier days prevailed in Europe. While out of his jurisdiction the question whether the originaire of Muscat has ceased to be the Sultan's subject cannot be effectually raised; but on return to his native land the question may arise. It is not stated that any in the list are naturalized as Frenchmen; and even if they were, their new nationality would not, without the Sultan's assent, avail them in Oman. Various excuses for granting French flags to persons who were originaires of Oman, or on relations with Oman, are given :— French Case, 1. That they had no statut 'personnel (p. 10), pp. 10-44. gjicl no country but the sea. This suggestion is disposed oE by reference to the facts. 2. That they are polygamous Mussulmans, and have etablissements stables' in the different centres in which they traded. French Case,p. 11. This plea can hardly have been put for vi aid seriously. It is stated that a good many French [530] C 210 proteges created for tliemselves new families in Oman (p. 11); the truth being that their real establishment and domicil was in Oman. 3. That they have residence in a French French Case, p. 12. Colony. By this would seem to be meant posses sion of a house in the Colony, which, under the Brussels Act, is a further condition superimposed on those of being a subject or protege of the State to which the Colony belongs. This point has already been discussed in the British Case, and reference to the proces-verhal of the statements made by the quarantine-breakers shows that the residence was colourable only (see British Case, pp. 85 and 80). At p. 8 of the Case the dhow-owners are described as having for the most part a domicil in a French Colony (French Case, p. 8), But a few pages later in the Case the same men are described as having a ' port d'attaehe,' which is French Case, p. 14. described as &lt;£ en effet son domicile.' This last description is utilized to justify the practice set up of registering at Muscat—a foreign port— proprietors who were subjects of, and resident in, the State of which the foreign port is capital. The words domicil and residence appear in truth to be used in an equivocal sense : either they mean something short of what they mean in inter national law, or, if used in the full sense, Siiris domiciled in Oman, even if naturalized as Irenchmen, are not qualified in international law, or under the Brussels Act, to be registered in Oman as owners of vessels flying the French flag- The instructions given to French officials (French Case, p. 14) only to renew the papers (' remplacerles titres ') of ships whose home port is the port where the officials reside, are acceptable French Case, p. 14. as a measure of precaution, but cannot be regarded as justifying the issue of French papers at Muscat by the French Consul to Omanis resident in Muscat and subjects of the Sultan; and the process of such registration cannot be regarded as a mere matter of procedure, since it involves an assertion of a claim to put the Sultan's subjects under a foreign flag in his territory and waters without any capitulation or usage authorizing such a practice. And France admits the need of caution, because of ' les declarations souvent French Case, p. 14. inexactes des indigenes,' who undoubtedly get on to the French register by means of misleading statements.11 If the lists so often promised by Prance to His Highness the Sultan and to Great Britain had heen delivered without delay, His Highness would have had no difficulty in verifying on the spot the names of the persons included therein as French proteges.12 IY.—THE PRBNOH LIST OE ELAG- HOLDERS. The list of Omani dhows which have re- Freuch Case, ceived French papers, printed at pp. 58 and 59 58 and 59 ' of the Prench Case, shows that thirty Omanis possess French papers in respect of fifty-six dhows, with crews amounting in all to 1,060 men, and that France claims (French Case, p. 8) French protection for the owners and their families, and the crews of their vessels. The whole population of Siir, male and female, does not exceed 10,000, and if to the persons claimed as French proteges are to be added their wives and families, one quarter of the population of Stir will be exempt from the Sultan's jurisdiction. His Majesty's Government welcome the tardy delivery of this long promised list, as an admission of the correctness of the statements made by the Sultan and the British Consul in Muscat, that a lar£?e number of Omanis had received French papers for their ships. They cannot, however, admit that the list supplied is a complete per formance of the promise made. No indication whatever is given therein of the qualification in respect of which any of the Arabs named (who are admitted by France to be Omanis) have been allowed to hold French papers or the French flag. It is not stated whether any of the Arabs has his domicil or chief establishment in Oman or in a French Colony or Protectorate, nor whether he is a French subject or in the service of a French subject in Oman or elsewhere, although from the Statement (at pp. 13 and 14 of the French Case) that Muscat is the ' port d'attache' of these Arabs, it may be inferred that they are domiciled or resident in Oman. In view of the small number of Arab personal names, it is difficult to fix the identity of an Arab unless he is described more fully than is done in the French list. The only effective mode of description for purposes of identification is that indicated by His Highness the Sultan in his letter of the 21st March, 1905. But meagre Appendix 4, p. i2. as is the description in the French list, and after allowing for the difficulties in setting13 down Arab names witli accuracy, and the difference between the Prencli and English mode of writing such names, it will be found on com parison of the list given in the French Case at p. 58, with that of the signatories of the docu ment given to the Sultan at Siir in June 1900, printed at p. 68 of the British Case, that a number of the persons who appear in the French list are Suris, and there resident, and that they promised the Sultan, in June 1900, to surrender their French flags. This they would long since have done but for the pressure put upon them by the French Consul at Muscat, and the Commanders of the French war-ships 'Catinat' and 'Troude,' and it should at this point be distinctly stated that the surrender of these flags was not in any way due to the act of the British Government, but was the result of an interview between the British Case, p. 68. Sultan and his subjects at Slir. Appendix 5, p. 13, In tbe Appendix will be found a collection of the lists of flagholders named in the British Case, and a partial identification of these men with those appearing in the French list. The number of vessels—fifty-six—given in the French list, is about one-third of the dhows which bslong to the port of Stir. The French Government admits (p. 14 of the French Case) that the French Consul at Muscat has orders to treat Muscat as the ''port d'attache' of the vessels in question, and that the ' port d'attache ' of a dhow owner is in effect his domicil. If this admission is to be interpreted as meaning that the owners of these vessels are domiciled in Oman, the action of France in granting the French flag to them is clearly an infraction of Article 32 of the Brussels Act of 1890, which is obviously intended to authorize the grant of the flag by the authorities in France or in a French possession or Protectorate, and not to authorize the grant by French Consular officers in foreign States; and it is further to be noted that that Article permits the grant of the flag only to subjects or proteges, and that none of the Signatory Powers is entitled by grant of its flag to claim as its prot£g6 an Arab not already internationally qualified for such protection. It is true that this contention has at times been advanced by French officials. M. Guy, the French Consul at Zanzibar, on the 7th September,14 1902, in a letter to Mr. Cave, the British President there, said :— ' Je vous rappellerai douc qu'il a toujours ete admis Appendix 6, p. 44. que les boutriers, patrons, et equipage naviguant sous pavilion Frangais sont proteges Fran9ais.' Mr. Cave replied, on the 15th September, 1902, that he could not for a moment accept this statement, and concluded as follows:— By Article 32 of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, to which the French Republic is a party, it is provided that authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers should only be granted to a native vessel the fitter out or owner of which is either a subject of, or a person protected by, the Power in question. I shall be much obliged if you will be so good as to inform me upon what grounds a native of Stir, in Arabia, has been granted the right of sailing under the French flag.' M. Guy, on the 15th September, 1902, in his reply modified his claim, and restated it as follows:— ' 11 est bien certain (et ceci m'amene au point que vous visiez in fine) que le proprietaire d une embarca- tion naviguant sous pavilion Fran^ais devait etre (d apies I'Acte de Bruxelles et d'apres nos lois) ran^ais, et son patron et ses hommes sont considerds comme 6tant au service des Franqais, et doivent par consequent jouir des avantages que leur accorde le Traite de Mascate. The Consul's first claim treated as admitted what had never been admitted, viz., that the persons on Arab vessels under the French flag were French proteges. The second claim treats as certain that such persons are French proteges because h rench Law and the Act of Brussels require as a condition precedent to a ship being French that its owner should be French. This is an obvious petitio principii, based on a fiction of service to a person assumed to be Prench, by reason of the flag used, without examination into the right of the ship to use the flag. It has already been pointed out that the French list merely states the names of the Omanis with out indicating how they became entitled to the French flag. The British Government claim again, as in the British Case, p. 23, that a written' explanation should be given of the grounds on which the titre de navigation was15 given to each of the Arabs on the list. They British Case, pi 70. would point out that M. Cambon, on the 25th June, 1900, informed the Marquess of Lansdowne that no new paper of protection would be given, and that existing papers would be carefully examined, so as to exclude those for the grant of which no just cause existed, and also that in the Prench Case it is stated (p. 14) that tbe Consuls at Zanzibar and Muscat have received orders (it is not said when) not; to grant Erench papers to any native vessel without first consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In view of these statements, it may justly be presumed that the materials are available for giving without delay a much more precise account of the Omani dhows than has yet been supplied. There has not been sufficient time fully to examine in Oman the Erench list or to test its accuracy, and, as will be seen later, difficulties have been placed in the way of utilizing the short time available. But from the letter of His Appendix 4, p. 42. Highness the Sultan, dated the 21st March, 1905, it appears that of the persons named three are dead:— Salim-bin-Mahomed Ali Badi (No. 23 on French list); Salim-bin-Thabet (No. 14); Ahmed-bin-Saeed (No. 22) Further, independently of the fuller explanation for which His Majesty's Government and His Highness the Sultan are entitled to ask, a com parison of documents in the British Case w 7 ith the French list makes it possible to give instances of the doubtfulness of the claims of these Omanis to be French proteges. Of the Arabs named in the four titres de navigation set out at pp. 45-47 of the British Case, there appears on the French list— Bachid-bin-Khamis, No. 8 ; Salim-bin-Thabet, No. 14; and Salim-bin-Mohammed, No. 10. In the case of each of these men the place of residence was left blank in the litre, although the men were clearly resident at Siir, and admitted by the French list to be Omanis, and the titres were surrendered to the Sultan at Siir. The attention of the Tribunal is directed to the Beport on p. 77 of the British Case that Salim- bin-Thabet was engaged in the Slave Trade, and [530] D16 to the Heport of the British Consul at Muscat of the 20th January, 1898, with respect to the case Appendix 7, p. f7. of Saiim Mohamed-ab-Bacli as a prete nom for Arab vessels sailing under a Prench flag, and to the correspondence with respect to slave running in the Persian Gulf by the same man under 'French colours. Passing thence to the Arabs whose breach of quarantine led immediately to the present arbi tration (British Case, p. 18), Abdulla-bin-Khamis- bin-Ali (whose name is No. 3 on the Erench list), in his deposition at p. 86 of the British Case, says :— 'I got my Articles fourteen years ago at Jibuti. I bought a house there, and a man named Musa-bin- Saleh lives in it. He pays me rental yearly, but at no fixed rate. I have never resided in Jibuti myself. I and my family and my ancestors have all been born and bred in Siir. I visited Jibuti two years ago.' And yet this man has been francise by the colonial authorities of Prance : and turning to the case of his son, Salim-bin-Abdulla (British Case, p. 85), we find him stating ;— ' I am a French subject, pure and simple. I cannot explain how I became one, but just like the other French subjects in Stir. I have no French papers. My father has . . . ; all I know about the Articles is that they give French protection. My father and my family and I have lived at Siir all our lives, and have never lived anywhere else.' The statement of the third quarantine-breaker, Khalfan-bin-Muhammed (British Case, p. 85}, is equally instructive. His name is not certainly traceable on the Prench list, but he states that he sails as captain ( £&lt; nakoda') in the buggalow of Juma-bin-Saeed, and there is a man of that name who is No. 6 on the Prench list. Khalfan states :— 'I am a French subject, having flown the French flag for five or six years. I got it at Jibuti, where I own a house. There is no one helongiug to me Residing in it.' Subsequently he says :• - ' I cannot exactly explain what grounds I have for believing that we are all French proteges. My cousin Juma knows most about it, and he says so. I made a mistake in stating that I share the ownership of a house tj, in Jibuti; it belongs really to my cousin Juma entirely17 but we are a united family, and look upon it as a family concern. Juma and I were both born and bred in Sur; neither of us nor any of our family have ever lived m Jibuti. As to the house, I have never lived in it, and I cannot say I have seen it. Juma has not been to sea for four or five years.' Yet Juma appears on the Prench list as an owner, and is presumably registered as resident in French territory. If the rest of the Omanis on the Prench list have no better claims to be on the li«t than those disclosed in the five cases which have been above discussed, what can be said for the value of that document as affording any person named in it the right to decline the jurisdiction of his natural Sovereign, and what is to be said of the effect on the authority of that Sultan of the belief that his subjects resident in his dominions can acquire immunity from his jurisdiction with the facility, and on the flimsy grounds above disclosed ? The manufacture of French subjects in Oman, if conducted on the lines indicated by these five cases, cannot but- be a menace to the independence of Sultan Saiyid Peysal. The summary in Appendix VIII of this Case of the returns from 1900 to 1905 of Arab vessels clearing under the French flag from Bombay for Oman on examination will be found to show that a number of vessels claiming the right to use the French flag have visited Bombay which do not appear in the French list. The in ferences to be drawn from this summary are either that the French list is incomplete and needs revision, or that Arabs have at Bombay claimed without authority the right to fly the French flag. It must be added that on receipt of a full copy of the French list from the British Consul His Highness the Sultan sent a trusted representative to verify its accuracy; but the persons claiming French protection refused to give any information and referred him to the French Consul, a refusal which amounts to a further assertion of their independence of the Sultan and a further illustration of the difficulties created for him by French action. It was not until the 25th March, 1905, that the French Consul in Muscat made an official communication to His Highness the Sultan, in closing a list of the boat owners who are under French protection. The Sultan declined to accept the list, claiming the persons thereon named as f530] D 218 his subjects. Tlie correspondence and the list supplied to the Sultan by France are printed in Appendix 12, pp. 55, 56 of this Counter-Case. It will be seen that that list does not contain the de tails to be found in the French Case, nor any men tion of the vessels claimed to be protected, or of their captains, and apparently it is expected that the Sultan should accept, without demur or examination, the claim of France to protect the persons named therein. In these circumstances. His Majesty's Goyernment deem it necessary to claim before the Tribunal that the Government of the French Republic should accord the facilities for investigating the French list, which are at present denied, and to contend that on a list, the verification of which has been impeded as above stated, no valid claim can be made to protect the persons therein named or indicated. Appendix 12, p. 55 s K yv.— THE GEOGrliAPHY OF OMAN. It is suggested in the Erencli Case (p. 35) that, in order to ascertain whether the complaint made against France is well founded, it is necessary to inquire what are the limits of the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, and who are his subjects. An inquiry of the nature suggested is not necessary to enable the Tribunal to deal with the questions involved, because, with very few, if any, exceptions, all the Omani Arabs, whose protection by France has caused the present dispute, are natives of, and resident in, Stir. That place has been part of the Sultan's dominions certainly since 1821, when it Avas conquered by the then Sultan of Muscat, with British aid, and it is to be observed that, while the bulk of the French Case is filled with suggestions that Great Britain has in various ways interfered with the independence of the Sultan, at p. M it is hinted that the Siir tribes have never ceased to proclaim their independence of the Sultan. The French Government do not venture to rest their Case on a distinct declaration or recognition of this alleged independence, which would be a patent breach of the Declaration of 1862, and they fail to indicate, though it is the fact, that the insubordination of these tribesmen is mainly caused by the protection given them by France by the methods of which Great Britain and the Sultan complain. The maps annexed to the French Case, opposite pp. 85 and 80, do not correctly indicate the boundaries of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat. The statement made in the French Case (p. 35), that at the time of the Declaration of 1862 the south coast of Persia, from Bostanah to Djask, and certain islands there named, belonged to the Sultan, is misleading. The predecessors of the present Sultan occupied territory for a good many years on the Persian coast from 13under Abbas to Lingah with the Island of Kishm, under a Firman of the Shah of Persia, to whom they paid rent or tribute. In 1856 a lease for twenty years was granted at an annual rent. In 1868 a new arrangement was made for eight years, also at a rent, but, on the occasion of civil war in Muscat in 1868, the Shah cancelled the lease, under powers given by the Convention, and resumed occupation of the territory in question.and it will be found on reference to the maps in the Erencli Case that, while Kiepert's map, dated in 1850, marks the territory as if it belonged to Oman, the Erench official map marks no territory on the Persian coast as belonging to Oman. Gwadur, which is mentioned in the French Case (p. 35), is an enclave on the confines of Persia and Beluchistan, which has for over 100 years formed part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, to whom it was granted by the Khan of Khelat. It extends for a radius of one stage (about 10 or 15 miles from the town of Gwadur). In this territory is a station of the Indo-Enropean telegraph, but it has never been occupied by Great Britain. The French Case (p. 38) states that English troops were landed on various occasions, notably in 1896, at Gwadur, for the purpose of repressing disturbances in Beluchistan, without any previous intimation to the Vali or the Sultan. His Majesty's Government have been unable to ascertain on what foundation this assertion is based. It is true that in 1896 a small body of men was landed at Gwadur in order to serve as an escort to Sir T. Holdich's mission for demarcating the Perso-Baluch frontier. The matter was not one of sufficient importance to call for any communication to the Sultan, but due notice had been given by tele graph to the British Native Assistant at the port, and all necessary arrangements were made by him with the authorities. His Majesty's Government are not aware of other occasions on which British troops have been landed at Gwadur. It is to be noted that in the Erench Case Hhofar and Gwadur are spoken of together, though they are on different sides of the Gulf of Oman. Passins? now to the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat in Arabia, it is necessary to premise that neither the coast-line nor the Hinter land of his territory has ever been delimited or accurately ascertained. The boundaries of that territory (and particularly the inland boundary) are not relevant to the present controversy, but inasmuch as allegations are made in the Erench Case (pp. 35-38) with reference to encroachments alleged to have been made on the Sultan's dominions by Great Britain, it is proper to deal with the question of boundaries so far as is necessary to meet these allegations. The southern limit on the coast line of Arabia reached by the Sultan's dominions is near Has21 Sair or Sajir. At Rakhiout (17° 15' south by 53° 25' east), a place near this point, the Sultan's Wali has built a fort. It is situate somewhat to the west of Merbat, the port assigned ou the French official map as the southern limit of Oman, and at the western limits of the territory of Dhofar, referred to on p. 35 of the French Case. The position of Hakhiout, as ascertained by Mr. Bent, the last European traveller who has visited that region, is indicated on the map annexed to t}iis Counter-Case. From Hakhiout up to and beyond the town of Muscat, the coast - line is continuously and admittedly under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. Siir, the district in which most of the French proteges reside, is somewhat to the north and west of Ras-el-Hadd, the easternmost point of Arabia. North and west of the town of Muscat the coast-line is under the undoubted dominion of the Sultan, so far as Khor Kalba. The maps in the French Case also assign to the Sultan all the coast-line of Arabia, from Khor Kalba up to Bahrein, and it is suggested that Great Britain has since 1862 deprived the Sultan of Muscat of his authority over the coast. This suggestion is made in ignorance or disregard of the history of the c ast in question. The Island of Bahrein is coloured as part of Oman in Kiepert's map of 1850. In 1779 it was conquered by the Uttoobee tribe, by whom it has ever since been held under allegiance at one time to Muscat, and afterwards successively to the Wahabees, to Turkey, and to Persia, and now it is independent. G-reat Britain has had Treaties with Bahrein from 1820 to 1861, all of which are prior to the Anglo- French Declaration. Since that date Great Britain has had further Treaties with Bahrein. The peninsula of El Katr, wrongly described as Bahrein in Kiepert's map, has never been subject to Oman, and has always been held by Arab tribes. Starting from El Odeid, the coast to the south and east up to a point where the mountains come down to the sea between Tibba (Tibat) and Sha'am or Shuam, known as the Pirate [coast, has been and is in the hands of six Chiefs. In order to put an end to piracy in the Persian Gulf, and to open it to commerce. Great Britain, so far back as 1806, commenced operations against the Maritime Chiefs of the Pirate coast, and against the Chief of Bahrein. In 1820 Treaties were also concluded with the Chiefs, who22 are commonly spoken of as the Trucial Chiefs, because of the Treaties of Maritime Truce con cluded with them between 1835 and 1853, by which their internecine strife upon the sea was stopped. These Treaties, it will be seen, were made long before the Anglo-Erench Declara tion of 1862, and when they were concluded Muscat had no claim of dominion or suzerainty over any of these Chiefs. Moreover, on refer ence to Kiepert's map in the Prench Case (p. 35), there will be found a dotted line round the bulk of the territory occupied by these Chiefs, indicating either an enclave separate from Muscat, or some ground for distinguishing the inclosed mainland and islands from the rest of what is treated as Oman, or (and more probably) indicating that the land and sea within the circle was the land and sea affected by the Maritime Truces con cluded with Great Britain ; and it may be added that these Treaties, so far from being an abroga tion of the authority of the then Sultan of Muscat, were made with his knowledge and approval, when he and Great Britain were co-operating to suppress piracy and the Slave Trade, and to open the Persian Gulf to international commerce. It is owing to the conjoined efforts of the Sultan and His Majesty's Government and these Treaties that the large traffic under many flags is enabled to pass freely in and out of the Persian Gulf. The Treaties of 1872 made with the Trucial Chiefs, and mentioned at p. 36 of the Prench Case, were made for the purpose of effectually putting an end to the Slave Trade. Great Britaiti has been compelled on occasion to intervene in case of infraction of these Treaties. But, in informing the Tribunal of these facts, the British Government are constrained to point out that the territory of the Chiefs in question is no part of the Sultanate, and that the statements about this territory made in, the Prench Case are absolutely irrelevant to the controversy submitted to the Tribunal. In passing from this subject, it should be said that a confusion seems to have arisen between the coast geographically known as Oman and that portion of the coast which politically belongs to the Sultan. Besides the portion of the coast, known as the Pirate coast, which belongs to the Sheikh of Shargah, that Chief claims authority over the coast-line north of Khor Kalba as as far as Ras Dibba as being part of the23 [530] territories of the Joasim tribe. ITor many years this coast, has been regarded as feudatory of the Sheikh of Shargah, and the coast itself as sub ject to the Maritime Truce already mentioned. The territory in question has never been under the sovereignty of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, and it is admitted in the Erench Case (p. 36) that this piece of coast is under the government of the Sheikh of the Joasim, residing at Ras-el-Kheima. From Eas Dibba to Tibba (Tibat) the coast forming the promontory of Mussandim is claimed by the Sultan, who has certainly before and since 1864i exercised authority on that coast by his 'Wali, and in other ways; and his rights on the coast are recognized by the Sheikh of Shargah and the Joasim. 7. This statement will show that, far from Great Britain having withdrawn the Trucial Chiefs from the dominions of the Sultan, in breach of the Declaration of 1862, it has dealt with them by Treaty for over forty years before that Declaration was made. On this point the con tentions of the Erench Case appear to be based on an insufficient knowledge of the history of the territories in question. But, before leaving the geographical part of the Erench Case, it is necessary to deal, under protest, with the suggestion (on p. 38) that the British Government are seeking to shut in the Sultan of Muscat, in disregard of obligations to the Ottoman Empire, by a series of Treaties with the tribes of Hadramaut. This allegation is abso lutely irrelevant to any question involved. The Treaties in question, and others, have been made in furtherance of the British policy of suppressing the over-sea Slave Trade, and pro tecting commerce; but that policy is certainly not based on any British designs against Oman, while, with reference to the Ottoman Empire, it is sufficient to quote the language of the late Mr. Theodore Bent, the latest European traveller who has visited Hadramaut :~ ' I may here emphatically say that the southern coast of Arabia has nothing to do wilh Turkey. From Muscat to Aden there is not a single tribe paying tribute to, or having any communication with, the Ottoman Porte, which was expelled from Southern Arabia in 1G30, and has not since that date been able to recover its lost supremacy.'24 VI.—BRITISH ACTION IN OMAN. The argument based by Prance on the Treaties French Case, 1 dd 37 38 made by Great Britain with the Saltan of Muscat (1891), the Sheikh of Abu Thabi (1892), and the Sheikhs of Hadramaut (1888), binding these Arab potentates to give Great Britain pre-emption in case of alienation of these territories is ill- founded : a Treaty stipulating against alienation of territory or giving a right of pre-emption to the other contracting party is in no sense incon sistent with the independence of the State which gives such pre-emption; indeed, it tends to pre serve and not to destroy the State which enters into the arrangement. Erance occupies this position as regards the Congo Iree State, and China and Turkey are both under obligations not to alienate territory. In the event of an alienation. Great Britain is to be preferred as purchaser. Other would-be purchasers may dislike the arrangement, but cannot assert that the seller has lost his inde pendence by making the bargain in question. He is under no compulsion to sell, and if the bargain has any specific tendency it is towards maintaining and not diminishing the territory of the Arab Sovereign in question. Nor can any sound argument against the Sultan's independence be drawn from the fact that Great Britain has agreed to pay him the Zanzibar subsidy. Greece is admittedly an independent State, but Great Britain, Prance, and Bussia make certain contributions to the civil list of the King, and, at the end of the Greco-Turkish war, a financial control was established in the interests of its creditors. The Ottoman Empire cannot be described as not in dependent, in spite of the financial assistance given to it in 1854 by Great Britain and Prance, the military assistance given in the Lebanon, and other arrangements which the Sultan has ac cepted on various occasions. Great Britain is under obligations to pay to Prance an annual sum with respect to Pondicherry; but the independence of neither nation is thereby impaired, and the with holding of the subsidy on the occasion of disputes between Great Britain and Muscat is a mere method (only once adopted) of obtaining a settle ment of the disputes such as might be adoptedby any debtor who lias a counter-claim against his creditor. It is impossible to read Avithout astonishment the suggestions made in the .French Case that G-reat Britain has infringed on the independence of Muscat— 1. By warning Arab Sheikhs of Oman who were in revolt against the Sultan that they must not attack Muscat or Muttra (p. 42). 2. By assisting the Sultan to put down the rebellion in Dhofar (p. 39). In both these instances the action taken by Great Britain was calculated and intended to preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan, and to maintain his dominions intact. Great Britain performed for Sultan Saiyyid Eeysal the promise made to his father, Saiyyid Turki, to stop attacks on the capital of Oman (French Case, p. 42). The Sultan's authority over the tribes of the coast and Hinterland has not been exercised with continuous success. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century Great Britain often helped the Sultan of Oman to resist the attacks of the Wahibi fanatics from the interior of Arabia; and even after the final repulse of these attacks, many tribes within the Sultan's dominions are recalcitrant if not rebellious, and attack the coast towns. The picture drawn in the French Case, p. 42, of the Sultan ' resigning ' himself to telling his rebellious subjects that if they attacked Muscat or Muttra they would also have Great Britain to reckon with, is a travesty of the real facts. Is it to be understood that the Sultan was unwillingly coerced into denying himself the pleasure of seeing his capital and chief commercial port besieged, taken, and plundered by the inland tribes, as the completest mode of asserting his independence of Great Britain ? And if (as is stated at p. 43 of the French Case), Arabs have one word for ' pro tection ' and ' protectorate,' what inference is to be drawn as to the action of France in Siir from the repeated use of these terms in the letter from the Arab flagholders, printed at pp. 65-70 ? a Et ci present nous prions le Gouvernement Frangais de nous donner une protection forte telle que personne ne nous fasse opposition, ni sur terre, ni sur mer, ni dans nos personnes, ni dans notre avoir, ni dans tout ce qui nous concerne,' p. 65. In truth it is obvious that the action of the [530] E 226 Britisli resident, of wliicli France complained, was based on friendship to the Saltan and desire to maintain his position and from a perfectly justifiable concern for the lives and property of the many natives of India resident in Oman (who British Case, p. 7 t are British subjects or proteges within the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1891) from injury by attacks of predatory Arabs from the Hinterland of Oman. Turning now to the Dhofar incident (p. o9 of the French Case), it is to be observed that both Great Britain and France agree that Dhofar is part of Oman. Mr. Theodore Bent, who travelled through that district very shortly before the disturbances in question, at first had an unfriendly reception, which he ascribed to the presence on the beach at Merbat of a large dhow Southern Arabia, flying French colours which he had reason to P- 232 • believe was conveying a cargo of slaves. He there met Suleeman, the Wali of the Saltan of Muscat, who had been in office for eighteen years. The district was certainly not wholly peaceful, and Mr. Bent's observation of the Wali's acts led him to conclude that his methods were somewhat rigorous. If the person who raised rebellion in Dhofar, Seiyyid Fazhil, was, as stated in the French Case (p. 39), a Turkish Chief, the attitude of the Sultan in opposing his endeavours to seize Dhofar was a natural resist ance to an attempt to transfer this very fertile part of the frankincense coast to another sovereignty, and the action of Great Britain in acceding to the Sultan's request for help was the action of a loyal ally assisting the Sultan to preserve his dominions from attack and not, as most unwarrantably suggested, an attempt to establish a Protectorate over Muscat or Dhofar. The British documents quoted in the French Case (p. 40 n), and the declaration of the Marquess of Dufferin there referred to (p. 40), demonstrate the correctness of the British attitude. The stipulation as to future arrange ments was a fair and just condition of assistance directed to preventing recurrence of local outbreaks or the severities of Wali Suleeman, and the result of the British action (which was confined to sending a ship of war to the spot, thus securing a bloodless victory for the Sultan), was, as stated in the French Case (p. 41), the restora tion of the authority in Dhofar of the Sultan's Wali, and the suppression of machinations intended to put that district under another authority.The action of Great Britain in thus assisting the Sultan to maintain his rights in his capital and in outlying parts of his territory may be contrasted with the action of France in making claims of protection, which, if successful, would withdraw over 1,000 of the Siiri tribesmen, with their very numerous dependents, from the Sultan's jurisdiction, and would result in the creation of an independent Arab community within his dominions. Yet another allegation by France needs to be dealt with—the suggestion that Great Britain attempted to impose Indian Customs officials, on the Sultan (p. 48). It is quite true that Great Britain has offered such officials as a means of securing a better collection of customs than was effected by the system of farming them and of putting an end to the evasion of such customs on the strength of possessing French papers. The proposal, if accepted, would have greatly increased the revenues of the Sultan, but the Sultan did not accept it. It should, however, be stated that the Siiris, who have the French flag and rely on French protection, refuse to pay more than a very small portion of the customs due from them, and that the consequent loss to the Sultan on the farm of customs at Siir is very great, as he realizes only 6,000 dollars a-year instead of 50,000. The French Government are, therefore, quite mistaken in saying (p. 47) that the Sultan's customs duties are not impaired by the grant of French flags. The revenues of the Sultan of Muscat have suffered severely by the habitual evasion by French flagholders at Siir of the whole or part of his lawful customs dues of 5 per cent. In order to lessen the Sultan's loss by this evasion, the Bombay Customs Department prepared, and at regular intervals sent to Muscat, a return of the native craft clearing for Oman. A summary of Appendix 9, p. 53. the returns is appended to this Case. From that summary it will be seen that only 12,023 bags of rice (168 lbs. each) were cleared for Siir, a place of 10,000 inhabitants, which is the chief import and export centre of the Sharkiyeh and Jalaan districts of Oman, vv 7 hereas 23,876 bags of rice were cleared for Maseira, an island of 1,000 inhabitants, mainly of the Jennebeh tribe, to which most of the French flagholders belong, and at which the Sultan has no Customs officer. The modus operandi seems to be to pay only on28 the manifest for Siir, and to land at Sur, without payment, goods cleared for Maseira. Eecent instances of the mode in which this evasion of customs duties is effected are given in Appendix 18.29 I X VII.- -THE COALING STATIONS QUESTION. Appendix 14, p. 56. His Majesty's Government learned at the end of 1893 that His Highness the Sultan had made an Agreement to grant to Prance a coaling station at Bundar Jisseh, about 5 miles from Muscat. The arrangement was made with great secrecy. Even M. Delcass^, the Erench Minister of Eoreign Affairs, was unaware of it when his attention was called to it hy the British Govern ment, and considerable difficulty was experienced in discovering its terms. It was the conduct of the Sultan in this matter, coupled with his delay in paying his liabilities to Great Britain, which led to the delivery of the Memorandum of the 3rd Eebruary, 1899, on which so much stress is laid in the Erench Case. His Majesty's Government expressed both to His Highness the Sultan and to Erance the view that the sale or lease of any part of Bis Highness* dominions to a foreign Power was not only a breach of the Sultan's Agreement with Great Britain of 1891, but was also inconsistent with the Declaration concluded between the British and Erench Governments in 1862. The Government of the Erench Republic accepted the British reading of the latter instrument, viz., that neither State might accept any cession or lease of Muscat territory ; and it was agreed that Erance should be free to establish a coal dep6t on the same terms as those granted to Great Britain, viz., on sufferance, and such a depot has been established in Muscat Harbour on a portion of the ground originally allotted to Great Britain for the purpose. The result, therefore, of British action has been to prevent a lease or cession of territory to Erance in contravention of the Declaration of 1862, which would otherwise have taken place. In other words, the British protest, so far from being a breach of that Declaration, prevented its breach by Erance.30 VIII.—-THE ZANZIBAR. SUBSIDY. The Zanzibar subsidy of 40,000 crowns was French Case, awarded by Lord Canning in 1861 in settlement of disputes between the sons of Sultan Saiwed t! V as to the partition of his dominions, which, at his death in 1856, included both Muscat and Zanzibar. In 1873, on the conclusion with both Muscat and Zanzibar of Treaties for suppressing the Slave Trade, Great Britain undertook to relieve the Sultan of Zanzibar of all liability for the 40,000 crowns, and guaranteed payment thereof to Sultan Saiyyed Turki, the Sultan of Muscat, ec so long as he continued faithfully to .fulfil his Treaty engagements and manifest his friendship towards the British Government. On the death of Sultan Saiyyed Turki in 1888, difficulties arose about the succession owing to the absence of any recognized law on the subject. His Highness Sultan Saiyyed Peysal obtained complete recognition as Sultan in 1890, and from that date until ] 899 the subsidy was regularly paid to him upon the same conditions as those upon which it was paid to his predecessor. The obligation of Great Britain is not, as suggested at p. 20 of the French Case, absolute and existin': in favour of every occupant of the Throne at Muscat. It depends on the arrangements made with each Sultan on his accession, and has, in fact, been only once withheld in the circum stances now to be stated. The rebellion of Abduilah-bin-Saleh (referred to in the French Case, pp. 42, 43) caused serious loss to British-Indian subjects in Oman. The claims for compensation in respect of losses to British subjects, as verified by a Committee of investigation, amounted to 77,894 dollars. The Sultan was required to pay the amount by quarterly instalments in three years, and proceeded to impose a punitive tax on the offending tribes for the purpose. Loans had also been made by the British Government to the Sultan in 1895 of ^0,000 rupees, and in 1S97 of 60,000 rupees. At the time of the delivery to the Sultan of the British Memorandum of the 9th February, j -899 (styled in the French Case an Ultimatum), large sums of money were due from the Sultan[530] in respect of the unpaid balances of the indemnity and the two loans, and in September 1899 the account stood approximately as follows:— Rupees, 'j Amount of arrears of subsidy from December 1898 to September 1809, both inclusive, at 7,200 rupees per mensem ,, ,, 75,000 | Deficit .. .. .. ,, 18,000 j! 90,000 ij ilupees. Amount of arrears of instalments due on account of loans for same months at 2,0-00 rupees per mensem .. ,. 20,000 Further balance due—total liquidation of loans, about ... .. .. 36,000 Balance of indemnity due to British subjects at 130 rupees per 100 dollar?, about .. 34,000 90,000 On the loth November, 1890, the subsidy for October 1899 was paid to the Sultan; the arrears above mentioned were paid to him, less two quarterly instalments in respect of the arrears of indemnity, and less 5 per cent, interest on the unpaid balance from February 1S99, and Itss the instalments due in respect of loans.32 IX.—THE ARAB FLAG. Tlie plain red flag usually borne by Arab vessels is not peculiar to Oman, but is carried by Arabs irrespective of their political nationality, See Frencli Case, and is regarded by them as the free flag of Islam. Pi) ' A certain amount of confusion arises from the use of the same flag by Arabs owing political allegiance to different Sovereigns, and from its similarity, at a distance, to the flags borne by Turkish or Egyptian vessels. So far back as 1835, in the Maritime Truces of that year, arrangements were made with, the Chiefs of the Pirate coast for the use by their vessels of a distinctive flag. The statement made at p. 37 of the French Case is irrelevant to the present controversy. The proposal by the British Government, on which animadversion is there made, would not prejudicially affect any subject of Oman, as the Colour proposed to the French Case, p 3' Sheikhs for their flag is that affected by Moslems who are descendants of the Prophet, or have made the pilgrimage to Mecca. The proposal to the Sultan of Muscat in February 1899 that he should order his subjects to use a distinctive flag was made to enable the Sultan to avoid the embarrassment which had been, or might be, caused through the use by Muscat subjects of the flag or papers of other Powers, and because sucli flag would serve to emphasize and preserve the integrity of His Highness' sovereign rights over his own subjects.X.—THE SLAVE TRADE TREATY OF 1873. i Case, It is somewhat late to challenge in 1905 for the first time as an infraction of the Declaration of 1S62, a Ireaty made in 1873. Treaties relative British t0 1116 sup I )ressio11 of the Slave Trac| e have been in icrce between Great Britain and Muscat since 1822. The Sultan gave authority to British vessels to search for slaves in Muscat waters so far back as 1850, and this authority was in force when the Declaration of 1862 was signed. The effect of the Treaty is to enable one of the High Contracting Parties to do work which the other has no vessels suitable to undertake, in the policing of Oman waters for tbe suppression of slavers. And under the Brussels Act, all the adhering Powers except France concede to each other mutual rights of search of Arab boats bearing their colours even on the high seas— hardly a mutual surrender of independence. Indeed, the Treaty is but one of a series of Treaties made during the last fifty years by Great Britain with the Rulers of the Arabian coasts with the single object of suppressing a nefarious trade—Treaties which have formed the subject of legislation by the British Parliament, with the object of providing a regular adjudica tion on the character of vessels seized under the provisions of these engagements.^' Ko doubt under the Treaty, apart from any special capitulation, British vessels would be entitled to seize any vessel found in Muscat waters carrying slaves, irrespective of her flag • and in the case of the dhows referred to in the French Case (p. 32), the vessels were only handed over to the French authorities because the Captain of the British cruiser which captured them was under the impression, subsequently * See also ' J he Slave Trade (East African Courts) Act, 1873,' 36 &amp; 37 Vict., cap. 59j in which is contained a recital that by various Treaties Her Majesty is empowered to exercise juris diction witlin the dominions of the Imam of Muscat in regard to vessels captured on suspicion of being engaged in the Slave Trade, and The Slave Trade Act, 1873 ' (36 &amp; 37 Vict., cap. 88), which repeals and supersedes the Statutes U &amp; 12 Vict,' cap. 128, and 12 &amp; 13 Vict., cap. 84. [530] ^ 2u found to be erroneous, that the place of seizure was on the high seas, and not in the territorial waters of His Highness the Sultan. And it may be of interest to the Tribunal to be referred to a decision of the highest British Court in which the seizure made by a British cruiser under the authority of His Highness the Sultan of a British ship engaged in the trade of Can- v. Fracis, L 0 0 limes, and Com- gun-running forbidden by His Highness Decree pany, L.R, 1902, was held legal on the ground of the indepen- ^PP^ 1 Cases ' dence of the Sultan and his legislative com petence to make the Decree in question.(f) XI.—THE LOU WATI A. The Louwatia, with respect to whom a com plaint is made against Great Britain (French Case. p. 45) are more usually known in India as Khojas. These Khojas are a Mohammedan sect Appendix 10. p. 53. of Indian origin, whose religious head in India is His Highness the Agha Khan. Many of them migrated to Muscat from Hyderabad, in Sind and Kattiawar, and they form distinct communities in Oman, and are known there as Hyderabadis or Louwatras. About 1,000 are in Muscat, and in Muttra they occupy a separate fortified quarter containing about 500 houses, into which no stranger is allowed to enter. It is well known to persons familiar with the East that races and faiths do not tend easily to commingle as they do in the West. The Khojas who migrated from India before the British annexation of Sind in 1843, and their descendants have always been considered as subjects of the Sultam and those who migrated later, with their descendants, have been con sidered as British subjects. Some of the Khojas who migrated from Cutch and other native States of India are treated as Jhitish proteges under Art. 2 of the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1891 (printed at p. 7 of the British Case), which continues an arrangement to the like effect made in 1873 with the then Sultan of Muscat. These facts explain the diversity of status among the Khojas on Appendix 10, p. 53. ^hich Prance makes comment. There is no reason to suppose that Col. Miles issued any notification to the Khojas as suggested in the Erench Case, p. 45. Public notices were, as a matter of ordinary routine, posted by the British Consul, inviting British subjects resident in Oman to register themselves at the British Consulate. An example is given in Appendix 10. The Khojas are oftenin pecuniary difficulties, and occasionally to evade the jurisdiction of a British Court, some of those who fall into the category of British subjects, claim to be subjects of the Sultan. Abdul Hussin-bin-Eadl mentioned in Appendix n, p. 54. the French Case was an old man who had always36 claimed British protection, but suddcoly claimed to throw off his nationality, and this claim the British Consul rejected, on the knowledge that it was made to evade a suit pending against the man in the High Court of Bombay.37 XIL—ZANZIBAR. The reference in the 'French Case (p. 5) to the British Protectorate of Zanzibar is wholly irrele vant to the questions in controversy before the Tribunal. Zanzibar and Muscat ceased in 185fi to be under the same Sovereign. The reciprocal French Case, p. 51. Declaration of 1862 as to respecting the indepen dence of Muscat and Zanzibar applied to these States as separate entities, and the Anglo-Prench Declaration of the 5th August, 1890, which followed on the assumption by Great Britain, of a Protectorate over Zanzibar, while constituting an acceptance by France of that Protectorate (m con sideration of getting a free hand in Madagascar), and a modification of the Declaration of 1862, so far as concerned Zanzibar, had no connection what ever with Muscat; and the Declaration of 1890 contains no reference to Muscat and no stipulation affecting that State, but deals solely with the results of the neAV situation created by the Pro tectorate of Great Britain over a State which had for thirty-four years ceased to be part of the Sultanate of Oman. Great Britain has not sought in any way to alter the situation created at Muscat by the Declaration of 1S62, and the present controversy has arisen out of the action of Prance in a manner inconsistent with the obligations with regard to Muscat imposed upon her by that Declaration. It is quite true that disputes have arisen with French Case, p. 49. aspect to the rights of France in Zanzibar, somewhat similar to those submitted to the Tribunal in respect to Muscat, and that France has made claims there with regard to the protec tion of Zanzibari and other Arabs and their vessels, which were rejected as inadmissible by French Case, p. 50. Great Britain; but these disputes have been settled by an arrangement made the 13th May, 1904, which limits French protection to persons who are originaires of countries under French protection or are hand fide in French service. If France were prepared to make a similar arrangement as to Oman, she would then be limiting her protection within the terms of the British Case, p. 6. Treaty of the 17th November, 1814, and abandoning her present ill-founded claim to pro tect originaires of Oman who are not bond fide in French service.38 CONCLUSION. In conclusion, His Majesty's Government sub mit with confidence to the Tribunal that nothing in the French Case displaces the statements or contentions contained in the British Case, and that upon consideration of the statements and contentions of both Parties to the arbitration it is clearly proved that the French practice of francisation of Omani dhows exists, that its effect is seriously to impair the authority of the Sultan over his own subjects in his own dominions, and that his well-founded protests have been dis regarded and his independence threatened by persistence in a practice which has no warrant either in international law or under the municipal laws of France. His Majesty's Government, on their own be half and on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat, desire to repeat the protest which they have already made against the introduction into the French Case of the matters dealt with in Parts Y, VI, X, XI, and XII of this Counter-Case. They are absolutely irrelevant to the inquiry before the Tribunal, which relates solely to the action of France with regard to those who are admittedly subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. His Majesty's Government have adverted to them only because they did not think it right that erroneous statements with regard to their action in Muscat should be allowed to pass without correction.39 APPENDIX 1.

Veuillez, &amp;c. (Signe) PAUL CAMBON, (No. 4.) Ihe Marquess of Lansdowne to M. Cambon. Your Excellency, Foreign Office, April 13, 1 ( ,)05. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo on the question of the introduction of the name of the Sultan of Muscat in the British Case as one of the Parties in the Muscat Dhow Arbitration. Your Excellency states that the French Government take note of the promise made by me that, in the further documents to be presented by His Majesty's Government to the Tribunal, the name of His Highness will not appear as one of the Parties to the Arbitration. It is not necessary, therefore, to enter into turther argument as to the grounds on which His Majesty's Government originally thought it right to insert His Highness' name. But as your Excellency has referred to what passed between us on the 25th May, 1903, in regard to the Agreement for referring the question at issue to arbitration, I think it right to observe that the passage which, at your request, was omitted from the draft of my note on the subject, provided for the reference to arbitration of any questions which the Sultan might desire to raise. It is the fact, as your Excellency states, that you objected on behalf of the French Government to accepting any demands for arbitration which the Sultan might himself put forward. But I did not at the time understand you to state that your Government Avished to preclude the Tribunal from taking cognizance of the Sultan's views upon any questions affecting his interests which the British or French Government might desire to refer to it for settlement. His Majesty's Government will communicate your Excellency's note, with this reply, to the Tribunal, in the same manner as the previous correspondence. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) LANSDOWNE. APPENDIX 2.

APPENDIX 3. Major Fagan {British Consul at Muscat) to British Consul-General at Bushire. Muscat, January 20, 1898. I HAVE the honour to furnish you with information regarding the two dhows carrying slaves under the French flag captured'by His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx' in September 1896. 2. The names of these two dhows were the ' Salama ' and the ' Saad.' The captain of the ' Salama' was Abdulla-bin-Muhammad, Baluch, an inhabitant of Abu Abali, a place on the Batineh coast, about 50 miles from Muscat, and within the territories of His Highness the Sultan. The owner was Hamed-bin-Abdullah, Baluch, of the same place. It will be observed in the litre de navigation of this vessel (copy of which I attach) that the owner is described as Ahmed-bm- Abdullah, resident of Majungo'(a port in Madagascar), and that he is only accorded the right of sailing under the French flag on the coast of Madagascar and the islands contiguous to (' avoisinant') that coast. _ _ 3. The captain of the ' Saad' was Mubarak-bin-Saeed-bin-Ali, Arab, of the Bern Kasib tribe, an inhabitant of Siir. The owner was Saeed-bin-Muhammad-bin-Abdulla, Arab, of the Beni Rasib tribe, also an inhabitant of Siir. It would appear, from an office Memorandum of this vessel's papers made about the time of capture by Captain Beville (copy inclosed), that she is represented therein to be owned by Mibzami Nouli, of Great Comoro, and that she^was licensed to trade under the French flag on the African and Madagascar coasts and in the Gulf of Oman. (No copy of ihe actual titre de navigation of the ' Saad' appears to have been kept.) 4. ft would thus appear that in the case of the ' Salama,' the owner,, when applying for French papers, gave his right name, but fraudulently described himself as an inhabitant^ of Majungo, while the ' Saad's ' papers were obtained by fraudulently representing her as belonging to an inhabitant of Great Comoro, to whom she, in point of fact, did not belong. 5. I am informed that it is quite a common practice for inhabitants of Sur, the Batineh coast, and other places in the Persian Gulf, who own dhows and wish to procure the right to navigate them under French protection, to send their dhows down to French settlements and to fraudulently represent that they belong to inhabitants living in those places, thus obtaining French papers and the right to fly the French flag. (&gt;. The following is a case in point; About two or three months ago Abdul Muhasan, an inhabitant of the Island of Keis (Persian territory), made a complaint to the Sultan of Muscat against one Yousaf-bin-Saeed, of the Yal Sad tribe, an inhabitant of Mesnxh, Batineh coast, to the effect that this individual was the Nakhoda of complainant's dhow, and, while serving in this capacity, he took the dhow to Bookeyn (a port in Madagascar), and fraudulently obtained French papers for the dhow which he registered in the name of Salim-bin-Muhammad A1 Badi, who was at the time living in French territory, but was originally a subject oF the Sultan of Muscat. The complainant represented at the same time that the Nakhoda had returned to Mesnah, on the Batineh, and had beached the dhow and put her up to auction. 7. On receiving this complaint the Sultan ordered the Wali to make inquiries into the case, which he did, with the result that the complainant's story was found to be correct. Sa1im-bin~ Muhammad A1 Badi, who happened to be at Mesnah at the time, took over the papers and the French flag from the Nakhoda of the dhow, and delivered her over to the Wali. I am informed that there has been some correspondence on the subject between the Sultan and the i rench Vice-Con sul. 8. I beg to add, in conclusion, that the two Nakhodas sentenced on the_28th August, 1897, by the Court at'Eeunion to a term of imprisonment were released on the 18th instant at the request of the French Vice-Consul.

(After compliments^) I HAVE the honour to make a reference to j-ou regarding the 30 persons from among my subjects whom the Frendh Government -claim to protect, together with their dhows and the . , i • - identity, instance, one ot them is quoted as ' Juma-bin-Saeed' and his dhow the ' Fateh-el-Khair ' and i , 1 !• • w- ^ j rw » • a. t/jljl i vi l.** / eacli person named in the list, with opportunities for the production of witnesses and documents, T cannot admit that any single one'ot those mentioned is entitled to French protection. Accor dingly, it has been necessary to inform you to that effect. Ihe details which I require in regard to the claimants are as follows :— The individual's name, such as Mubarak (bin). His father's name, „ Salim (bin). His grandfather's name, „ Mahomed. His nickname, if any „ ' El Katheree.' His clan or sub-tribe ,, Fowaris. His tribe „ Jennebeh. lhat is Mubarak-bin-Salim-bin-Mahomed El Katheree Clan Fowaris, Tribe Jennebeh. I beg: vou Avill obtain this information for me, and communicate it to me. Apart from the above request, I note that among the individuals named on this list whose names 1 recognize as belonging to persons whom 1 can identify (as claiming French protection) are included several persons long since dead. How can the French Government include such i/i m their list ? Those to whom I refer are three in number— (1) Salim-bin-Mahomed Al Badi (No. 93 on French list). (2) Seleem-bin-Thabet (No. 14 „ ) (3) Ahmed-bin-Saaed (No. 22 „ ', ' )* This is what had to be explained, and Salaam. Datfid A Afh m j moo (Signed) FE1SAL BIN TURKI, Dated UthMuharrum, 1322. Stdtan MvmaLThe foots of the oase are as follows: A British Indian subject applied to the Court of His Highness the Sultan's Delegated Jurisdiction for a summons for debt against Juma-bin-Mubarak, and it having been proved to the satisfaction of the Judge that the debtor intended to leave the jurisdiction of the Court, a warrant was issued for his arrest. On the receipt of your letter of the Gth instant, I had informed the Judge that Juma might claim to be under French protection, and the case was, for this reason, heard as soon as possible. When Juma was brought before the Court he was asked on what grounds he claimed French protection, and replied: u I am a Siiri Arab, but my wife lives in Comoro ; I therefore claim French protection, as 1 have often stayed there. At present, my wife and I live in Arabia.' As neither the man's own statement nor the fact that he was the captain of a dhow sailing under French colours was considered by the Judge to be a sufficient reason for his withdrawal from His Highness the Sultan's jurisdiction, Juma was ordered to give guarantee for the payment of his debt, and, on his refusing to do so, was ordered to be detained in custody until such security was forthcoming. On the 9tli instant a satisfactory guarantee was given, and the man was at once released. You state in your letter of the 7th instant that 1 had verbally informed you that, even if I had considered Juma-bin-Mubarak to be a French-protected subject, I could not have interfered with the Judge's action in the matter if the latter were of a different opinion v Allow me to observe that you have not quite correctly quoted my words. 1 said that, although, under the circumstances, I should endeavour to convince the Judge that the man Avas not in effect under his jurisdiction, and although I was convinced that he would pay great attention i:o my repre sentations, I could not actually deprive the Court of a function which is inherent in all Courts, namely, that of determining whether a particular person or thing is or is not within its jurisdiction. But I added that, although on these grounds I could not technically assume responsibility lor whatever action the Judge might take, I was strongly of opinion that the judicial proceedings in the particular case under discussion had been absolutely correct, and was luliy prepared to support them. The only ground on which you claim Juma-bin-Mubarak as a French-protected person is that he is the captain of a dhow sailing under the French flau', and you state that ' it has always been admitted that the crews of dhows, captain and men, sailing under French colours, are under French protection.' This statement I cannot for a moment accept. You support it in a private letter to Mr. Vice-Consul Kestell-Cornish by saying that you have found in the archives of your Consulate letters from Sir A. Harainge, myself, and others, introducing to the Consul for France Indians who had claims to advance against the personnel of French dhows; it is quite possible that the individuals against whom these claims were made were considered on other grounds to be under French protection at Zanzibar, or, if that was not the case, that the information on which the introductions were given was false; but, however that may be, I am convinced that no person employed on a dhow sailing under the French flag has, for that reason alone, been regarded by any Representative of the Protecting Power as under French jurisdiction within the territories of His Highness the Sultan. It is, of course, provided by the Brussels Act that the crews of native vessels shall, as regards their engagement and discharge and some other matters, be under the direction of the Consular authorities of the Powers under whose flags the vessels sail, but 1 am not aware of any engagement to which the Sultan of Zanzibar is a party under which persons so employed can withdraw themselves in civil or criminal matters from the jurisdiction to which they would otherwise, when in Zanzibar, have been subject. It appears from the evidence given in the case that the money claimed from Jnma-bin- Mubarak was employed by him in the purchase of a dhow of which he is the master, and that he is, therefore, the owner, as well as the captain, of a vessel which sails under the French flag. By Article XXXII of the General Act of the Brussels Conference, to which the French Republic is a party, it is provided that authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall only be granted to a native vessel the fitter-out or owner of which is either a subject of or a person protected by the Power in question. I shall be much obliged if you will be so good as to inform me upon what grounds a native of Siir, in Arabia, has been granted the right for sailing under the French thig. I have, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Chief of Shargah, Head of the Joasim tribe, regarding the recovery of some slaves freshly imported into Khor Fakan on the Batineh coast, a Joasim Chief- ship. The Persian authorities have also been requested to recover such of them as can be traced in Persia. 2. I have taken advantage of the departure of Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' for Muscat by way of Bahrain and the Arab coast to forward my letter through Commander Hart-Dyke, R.N., who will impress upon the Chief of Shargah the necessity for exertion in this case. 3. A further report will be submitted hereafter. In closure in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot to the Chief of Shargah. (After compliments.) Bushire, June 30, 1892. SOME time ago it was reported to me that one Salim-ul-Badi, a subject of lias-ul-Khaimah, had arrived at Kiior Fakan from Zanzibar with some raw slaves, and that he had written to the Chief of_Kas-ul-Khaimah inquiring whether he might bring the slaves to Ras-ul-Khaimah, but had received no answer. I caused further inquiries to be made, and have now ascertained that Salim-ul-Badi had with him thirty-three slaves, fifteen of whom he has by this time disposed of at various places, ten are with him in his boat, while there are still eight belonging to him at Klior Fakan. Ihe Sheikh of Khor Fakan is of your tribe and subordinate to you, and, in accordance with the Agreement of 1847, it is my duty to call upon you as head of the Joasim to require from the Sheikh of Khor Fakan the surrender of the eight slaves still at Khor Fakan. I must further request you to recover from Salim-ul-Badi a fine of 70 dollars per head of each of the thirty-three imported slaves, such fine to be reduced by 70 dollars for each slave produced by him for manumission. (No. 2.) Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot to the Government of India. (Extract.) ^ Bushire, October 3, 1892. I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, copies of correspondence regarding the slave-running operations of Salim-ul-Badi, a subject of the Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah. 2. Some delay has been caused in the submission of this report by the omission until quite recently of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah to reply to my letter to him of the 7th August last ihis reply, received on the 1st instant, cannot, in my opinion, be considered as satisfactory. I here can be no reasonable doubt that the Sheikh has been all along fully cognizant of Salim-ul- Badi's proceedings, and although, according to the report first received from the Residency Agent, Shargah, he was said not to have replied to the letter in which Salim-ul-Badi announced his arrival from Zanzibar with slaves, and asked whether he could safely come to Ras-ul-Khaimah, his subsequent conduct in sheltering both him and the Sheikh of Khor Fakan, where the slaves were first landed, makes him a particeps criminis in ail that has taken place. I have ascertained personally from Commander Hart-Dyke, R.N., that the Residency Agent's report of his interview with the Sheikh is correct, and there can be no real doubt of the latter's knowledge of Salim-ul- Ladi s doings, though that is now disavowed by him. ^ ^ ie responsibility in this case must, I consider, be shared between the Sheikhs of Ras-ul- Khaimah and Khor Fakan, and if they are not able to recover from Salim-ul-Badi a fine of 70 dollars for each slave imported, it must be exacted from them, in the proportion, I would suggest, of two-thirds from the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, who, as a Trucial Chief, is the worse offender, and of one-third from the Sheikh of Khor Fakan. The Sheikh of Shargah, as the recognized head of the Joasim, is responsible for the conduct of a subordinate Sheikh of the tribe, such as Khor Lakan, even though the latter may not be directly under his authority. It is necessary to enforce this responsibility, both in order to limit the number of the Sheikhs to whom Government can look tor the repression of slavery to those with whom it has Treaty engagements, and also [530] I £48 to check a Traffic 'wliicli is again on the increase, and which these Sheikhs habitually allow in their territories in disregard of their Treaty obligations. In default of payment by the Khor Fakan Sheikh, the Chief of Shargah must therefore make good the amount, and if the fine is not paid, boats belonging to both Ras-ul-Khaimah and Shargah will be seized and sold to make it good. Inclosure 1 in No. 2. Report from the Residency Agent, Shargah, dated February 8, 1892. OiSIE Salim-ul-Badi went from lias-ul-Khaimah towards Zanzibar and settled in Bukin. He iias become wealthy, and wants to return to Ras-ul-Khaimah; but as he was in possession of slaves he proceeded to Jasa, one of the neighbouring villages of Muscat, and wrote to the Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah asking to be given an assurance that nobody would seize the slaves in his possession when he would come to Ras-ul-Khaimah ; otherwise he would go and settle in another country. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah is said not to have given him any answer, and he pro ceeded' to Khor Fakan, which is under Sheikh Hamaid-bin-Majid-bin-Sultan-bin-Saghar Gliasenr. Inclosure 2 in No. 2. The Residency Agent, Shargah, to Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot. July 20, 1892. I HAVE received your letter dated the 5th Dil Hajjah. 1309 (30th June, 1892), by the hands of Captain Hart-Dyke. On my departure to Abu Dhabi I deputed a person to find out the place where Salim-ul-Badi was staying after his return from Katr, and to let me have the information at Ras-ul-Khaimah if I arrived there with the man-of-war. On my return to Shargah in the man-of-war the Chief of Shargah was sent for, and the Captain delivered to him your letter, whereupon a discussion took place regarding the surrender of the slaves and the recovery of the fine of 70 dollars per each from Salim-ul-Badi. But the Chief of Shargah excused himself from moving in the matter on the ground of his being unablo to manage the affair, since Khor Fakan is not utider his jurisdiction, but belongs to his cousin, who has been ruling over it for years, like the other sons of Sultan-bin-Saghar, over their respec tive possessions. Seeing that the discussion was fruitless of good result, I went to Ras-ul-Khaimah in the man-of-war. Here my informant told me that Salim-ul-Badi and his boat were in the place, and by looking with a telescope we saw that the boat had French colours. At an interview between the Captain and the Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah regarding Salim-ul-Badi and Khor Fakan, the Chief stated that the man on his return from Katr and Bahrein had come to Ras-ul-Khaimah and beached his boat there for repairs. After finishing he intended to proceed to Bussorah shortly. The Chief further stated that he could not seize anything from, or exercise his authority over, Salim-ul-13adi; and as regards the Chief of Khor Fakan, though he was his cousin, still he could not interfere with his actions. Whereupon the Captain desired the Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah to expel both Salim-ul-Badi and the Chief of Khor Fakan from his territory, so that they might go to their own country, Khor Fakan, where it would be probably necessary to enter into cor respondence with them. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah agreed to do so within five days, and then left the ship. After this I also landed at Ras-ul-Khaimah and remained there for three days, -fll during which I did not observe him taking any steps, so I reminded him of his promise and advised him to fulfil it, and he promised to do so, but my own impression is that neither Salim-ul- Badi nor the Chief of Khor Fakan will move from Ras-ul-Khaimah. Inclosure 3 in No. 2. Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot to the Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah. (After compliments.) Bushire, August 7, 1892. SOME time ago it was reported to me that one Salim-ul-Badi, a subject of yours, had arrived at Khor Fakan from Zanzibar with some raw slaves, and tbat he had written to you inquiring whether he might bring them to Ras-ul-Khaimah, but had received no answer. 2. I caused further inquiries to be made, and ascertained that Salim-ul-Badi had with him 33 slaves, 15 of whom he had disposed of at various places, 10 were with him in his boat, while there were still 8 belonging to him at Khor Fakan, 3. 1 addressed the Chief of Shargah regarding his responsibility, as Head of the Joasim, for the doings of the Chief of Khor Fakan, but I cannot absolve you also from share in it, for the Khor Fakan Chief is a relative of yours and has been living at Ras-ul-Khaimah, though you must have been aware of these matters. 4. 1 further requested him to recover from Salim-ul-Badi a fine of 70 dollars per head of each of the thirty-three imported slaves, such fine to be reduced by 70 dollars per each slave produced by him for manumission. This, however, is primarily your duty, as Salim-ul-Badi is your subject[530] H 2 5, I am aware from a letter from the Commander of Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx' that Salim-ul-Badi has been living lately at Ras-ul-Khaimah, and I also learn from the Residency Agent, Shargah, that he has not been sent out of Ras-ul-Khaimah as promised by you to the Captain of the man-of-war, nor has the Chief of Khor Fakan, who was also there, been sent back to his own place, as also promised, 6. You are well aware of your responsibility to the British Government in the matter of the importation of slaves, and unless you recognize it by taking effective steps to recover the fine imposed on one of your subjects engaged in the illegal Traffic, I shall be compelled to make some recommendations to Government that may not be agreeable to you. Inclosure 4 in No. 2. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah to Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot. 12th Safai\ 1310 {September 5, 1892). I RECEIVED your esteemed letter, and understood its purport regarding Salim-bin- Mohamed-ul-Badi. The fact is that formerly I did not allow him to come to my country when he had slaves with him ; but he came to me after his return to Katr and Bahrein,' when I did not find any slaves with him except those he stated to be the crew of his buggalow. He came to my country for the purpose of repairing his boat, and nut to take up a permanent residence in it. He left my country thirty years ago, and placed himself under the protection of the French Government. When I received your letter I demanded from him what you had required of him; but he became displeased with me, and left with the object of going to Bussorah. The hands of the Government can stretch far against him, and I hope you will not consider me guilty in a matter in which I have no power. Inclosure 5 in No. 2. Ihe Residency Agent, Shargah, to Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot, September 11, 1892. IN reply to your letter dated the 7th August last, I beg to inform you that I made inquiries regarding the slaves who were in possession of Salim-ul-Badi when he was in Khor Fakan. Beyond the news communicated to you in my previous report, which was reported to me by my messenger, no one else knows the number of slaves he possessed. My informant states that it appears to him that Salim-ul-Badi had thirty-three male and female slaves in Khor Fakan; ten of these were sent from Zanzibar in a Siiri boat (to SUr) in charge of one Bin Hashoom, of Ras-ul-Khaimah, and thence they were taken to the Batineh and Khor Fakan in native boats ; but the rest Salim-ul-Badi brought in his own buggalow. Some of these he has entered in the register as crew of his buggalow, and some his servants. On his voyage to Katr he sold some of them. When I went to Ras-ul-Khaimah in Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' I wanted to see the register of Salim-ul-Badi's boat, but he refused to show it. It is not possible to obtain a written declaration (that Salim-ul-Badi possesses these slaves), as, firstlv^ the prohibition of this Traffic is contrary to their religion, and, secondly, they are afraid of the 'ir Chiefs. Salim-ul-Badi intends leaving Ras-ul-Khaimah on the 5th September, presumably for Bussorah. Inclosure 6 in No. 2. Ihe Chief of Shargah to Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot. (After compliments.) 19^ Maharram, 1310 {August 13, 1892). I HAVE received your letter, dated the oth Zil Haj, 1309, and have learnt its contents. Regarding Salim-ul-Badi, who, you have heard, has slaves, and, according to what is known to you, is a subject of Ras-ul-Khaimah, know that he is not a subject ot Ras-ul-Khaimah, but is a merchant and traveller. Although he was born at Ras-ul-Khaimah, yet it is nearly thirty years since he has left the place and has settled himself in Obokh. He has assumed French nationality and terminated his connection with these parts. He has this year come here for trading purposes. The Captain of the man-of-war and the Residency Agent became acquainted with his affairs when they arrived here. I have no control over him, and the Government should excuse me in respect to a man who has nothing to do with me, and over whom I have no control.50 In closure 7 in No. 2. The Residency Agent, Sliarcak, to Lieutenant-Colonel Talbot. September 25, 1892. WITH reference to your letter dated the 25tli ultimo, I proceeded to Ras-ul-Kbaimuh and obtained an answer from the Chief of that place, which is inclosed herewith. From what I heard from people at Ras-ul-Khaimah, it appears to me that Salim-ul-Badi has no more slaves left with him, but he has nine freed slaves employed as the crew of his boat; the hands short in the crew of this boat have been engaged at Ras-ul-Khaimah. When Salim-ul-Badi sailed towards the Katr coast, all the crew of his boat were slaves, but he took some of the natives of Ras-ul-Khaimah to replace those whom he sold. As to the eight slaves who were seen by my Munshi in Salim-ul-Badi's house at Khor Fakan, when Salim-ul-Badi came to Ras-ul-Khaimah he sent his boat to Khor Fakan, and it brought eight male and one female slaves to Ras-ul-Khaimah k Of these he took eight male slaves with him on his voyage, said to be, tor Bussorah, and left the female slave at Ras-ul-Khaimah. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah, on being questioned by me about these eight slaves, said he did not know anything, and did not inquire about Salim-ul-Badi's affairs. I suppose these eight slaves will be taken by himself or sent from some other place for ftale to Katr, because the people of Ras-ul-Khaimah heard from him that slaves are dear there.53 APPENDIX 9. memorandum showing Total Merchandize exported from Bombay by Native Craft under French Flag to Oman Ports of South-East Arabia during the years 1900 to 1904.

IN acknowledging the receipt of your letter requesting answers to certain questions regarding the Indian Khojas and Muscat, I have the honour to submit herewith the information called for accordingly. Memorandum of Queries and Replies. 1. Do the Khojas of Muscat preserve a peculiar religion and peculiar social habits of their own, or do they combine with other com munities ? 2. Are there any Khojas who are beyond question subjects of the Sulian ? 3. If there are, do the Indian Khojas inter mix with them, or do the Indian Khojas form a separate community preserving an immiscible character ? 4. Do the members of the Khoja community at Muscat come from India only, or from other parts of the world as well ? The Khojas at Muscat do not combine with other communities. They dwell iu a separate walled quarter at Mutrah, called the Khoja Fort, and intermarry only among themselves. They comprise two parties, viz., the followers of Agha Khan, who preserve their peculiar religion and social customs, and those who have recently adopted the Mahommedan religion. The latter are in the majority, but even those notwithstanding preserve some of their old social habits. Yes. Such as those whose ancestors emi grated from Sind prior to British conquest, and such as have declared themselves Arab subjects. They are one and the same community, and intermix. The Khojas are Indians, and come from the Provinces of Sind and Cutch.54 5. Are there any general considerations I am not aware of any general considera- whicb. prevent Khoja immigrants from acquiring tions which would prevent Khoja immigrants the nationality of Muscat ? from acquiring Arab nationality if they pre ferred to do so. 6. Is the Sultan a party to the register of The registration of persons is done with the persons under British protection, or has he Sultan's cognizance, but notice is not usually notice of it, and has he ever objected to the given him. He has never formally objected to practice of registration ? the practice of registration so far as I am aware, but he has been furnished at his own request with a list of persons registered. 7. When Khojas born at Muscat of Indian Yes. On application being made by them, parents come of age, are their names entered in the Register ? 8. Are names ever entered in the Register Names are never entered in the Register except at the request or with the consent of unless at the personal request of the persons the persons themselves ? and after investigation. 9. Is it the open and acknowledged practice It has always been the custom to treat adult to treat adult ^Muscat-born descendants of Muscat-born descendants of Indian immigrants Indian-born immigrants to Muscat as protected as protected subjects, provided the immigrants natives of India ? were themselves British subjects or subjects of protected States ; provided also the descendants themselves desire to be so treated.

Memorandum regarding the Case of Abdul Hussein-bin-Fadl Ali, mentioned on page 19 of French Statement, AMONG the trading firms of Muscat and Mutrah is the British-protected Khoia firm of ' Fadl Ali Toorani and Co.,' trading with Bombay and Calcutta. Owing to the fact that its founder, Fadl Ali, migrated from India after the British annexation ol omd, and also that the trading operation of the hrm are carried on with India, both the family and the firm have always enjoyed British protection. Tnan y years ago and left four sons, who continued to carry on the business of the hrrn m his name. The eldest of these was Abdul Rab-bin-Fadl Ali, and the second, Abdul rlussein-bm-t 1 adl Ah, the individual referred to in the French statement. The elder of the two became the head of the firm, still trading as ' Fadl Ali Toorani and Co,'55 [530J I In September 1901, when British Consul at Muscat, I received for execution from the Calcutta Small Cause Court a Decree against the firm for a considerable amount, and from reports which reached me at the time of the state of the firm's affairs, I had reason to think that other similar claims from India were likely to follow. On the 9th January, 1902, following, a Petition was presented to me by the elder brother, Abdul Rab, asking that his name might be removed from the Register of British subjects. No application of the sort was received at this time or any other from Abdul Hussein, but as far as my memory serves me he did present himself with his brother, when I called for the latter on the 13th January, 1902. On this occasion^ I explained to Abdul Rab, who offered no explanation of his wish suddenly to divest himself of British nationality, that while the.British Government did not thrust their protection on people, nevertheless, seeing that he and his father had always hitherto claimed our protection, before I could take steps to take his name off the Register, I must ask for six months' notice and a substantial deposit as security for the satisfaction of any more claims that might come in against him as a British subject. It will be understood that there were strong grounds for thinking that his only object in desiring to take Muscat nationality in this sudden way was that it would be easier for him to evade, as an Arab subject, claims that might come against him from British India. He did not see his way to deposit any security and went his way, and I heard no more of his desire to change his nationality. He died a few months later. In December 1903 a suit was brought against the second brother, Abdul Hussein, in the Muscat Consular Court, in connection with the title to possess a certain plot of ground. Defendant was, as usual, summoned to appear, but refused to accept the summons, and a warrant had to be issued. On hearing of this, Abdul Hussein came to see me of his own accord, and said he had refused to sign the summons because he bad, since his brother's application of two years before, considered himself a Muscat subject. I explained to him that 1 could not accept this explanation ; that his brother had never completed the requirements for the removal of his name from the Register, and that, in the circumstances, I could not consider him (Abdul Hussein) as anything else than a British sabject. He accepted my decision in the suit without further appeal, and I had no dispute of any kind with His Highness the Sultan on the subject. If I saw him personally within a few days of taking the above action I should certainly have mentioned the matter to him, and probably did, but I have no special recollection of doing so, and His Highness certainly never addressed me any official communication on the subject. My successor at Muscat, Major Grey, has had considerable dealings with Abdul Hussein in the Consular Court, and informs me that the Khoja has never suggested any wish on his own part to change his nationality, and there can be hardly any doubt that his object in endeavouring to do so on the previous occasion in question was the one which I have suggested.

He moreover withdrew the suggestion he had made a week ago that France should keep the grant ot Bunder Gisseli under a formal assurance that it involved no territorial right. His Excellency stated, however, that it was necessary for his Government to be able to procure coal in these waters, and they accordingly proposed to establish a coal depot on exactly the same terms as our own, that is to say, on sufferance. But he requested that the British Consul at Muscat might be infonned that this was being done with the assent of Her Majesty's Government, as otherwise the Imaum might object to the arrangement I replied that I must in the first instance consult the Government of India, and that I would at once request the Secretary of State for India to communicate with the Viceroy on the subieet by telegraph.

LE Gouvernement de la Republique se trouvait done en presence d'nne double question: une question de fond, une question de forme. Au fond, quel grief pouvait-on invoquer centre nous ? Par le Traite de 1862, la France et I'Angleterre out pris I'engagement reciproque de respecter I'mdependance de I'lmam de Mascate. A cette independance, pas plus aujourd'hui que dans le passe, la France n'a aucune envie de porter la moindre atteinte. Kile I'a toujours dit; elle ne fait aucune difficult^ a le redire; et, pas plus sans doute que I'Angleterre, elle ne vise, par des moyens d6tournes, par des pactes separes, a se cr^er a Mascate une situation privilegiee et a afiaiblir a son profit la portee de la Convention de 1862. Serait-ce que la Concession d'un depot de charbon puisse justifier la moindre alarme ? Mais, depuis longtemps deja FAngleterre possede a Mascate un depot de charbon ; et comment ce que I'Angleterre a pu faire sans dommage pour la Convention de 1862, le seul projet de le faire a son tour pourrait-il constituer, de la part de la France, un manquement, une infraction a la memo Convention. Sur ce point, la discussion ne pouvait etre longue; aussi le Gouvernement de da Heine, renseigne sur les faits, sur nos intentions, n'a pas tarde a reconnaitre que, les droits de la France et de TAngleterre a Mascate etant identiques, comme identiques leurs obligations, la France pent tres legitimement y avoir a son tour un depot de charbon, exactement dans les conditions ou rAngleterre y a installe le sien.

I replied that I had been in communication with the Indian Government on the subject, and that I was now prepared to make to him the following proposal:— The ground available at present for coal stores in Makalla Cove should be^ divided as far as possible evenly between England and France, and two coal stores as nearly similar as possible established, one for the use of English vessels and the other for the use of French vessels. His Excellency said he doubted if this arrangement would be acceptable to his Government, but he undertook to lay it before them. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) SALISBURY. (No. 4.) Memorandum communicated to French Embassy, May 11, 1900. THE ground available in Makalla Cove admits of division into two parcels by means of a wall built from the sea to the high giound at the back- On one side of the wall would be the large shed No. 1 and a smaller one on the north side of it No. 2 ; on the other side of the wall would be shed No. 3 with any land that may lie to the south of the wall, and which can be more precisely defined when the division is made. Her Majesty's Government offer to the French Government their choice between the two sites, and the dividing wall will be erected by Her Majesty's Government on receipt of an intimation that the solution is accepted by the French Government. If the Ffench Government chooses the northern site with sheds Nos. 1 and 2, time should be allowed for the removal of the coal belonging to Her Majesty's Government in those sheds to the other site, and for the construction of the necessary shed. The French Government would probably in that case wish to pay for the sheds Nos. 1 and 2 at a fair valuation. Should the French Government be disposed to accept the southern site with its shed No. 3, Her Majesty's Government would propose to give that shed without making any claim lor compensation. (No. 5.)

(8474.) MUSCAT DHOWS ARBITRATION. IN THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION AT THE HAGUE. GRANT OF THE FRENCH FLAG TO MUSCAT DHOWS. REPLY ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY to the SUPPLEMENTARY CONCLUSIONS PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC, A ND ADMITTED BY THE TRIBUNAL ON JULY 25, 1905. london: PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN' OFFICE, BY HARRISON AND SONS, PRINTERS IN ORDINARY TO HIS MAJESTY.MUSCAT DHOWS ARBITRATION. E E P L Y ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY to the SUPPLEMENTARY CONCLUSIONS PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC, And admitted by the Tribunal on July 25, 1905. HIS Majesty's Government at the outset venture to point out to the Tribunal that the criticism made in the French ' Supplementary Conclusions' (p. 5) on the form of the British Argument is founded on a mistake. That Argument is framed in strict accord with the third paragraph of the British Case, p. 3. English text of the u Compromis,' and with the precedents of the British Arguments in numerous cases of arbitration, among which reference may be made to the arbitrations as to the Alabama Claims (1872), the Behring Sea Seal Fisheries (1893), the Venezuelan Boundary (1899), and the British Guiana and Brazil Boundary (1904). In exercising the right of reply granted by the Tribunal on the 25th July, 1905, His Majesty's Government will confine themselves strictly to the points raised in the French ' Supplementary Conclusions,' so far as they seem to require any reply.INTERVENTION OF THE SULTAN IN THE ARBITRATION. In the. u Conclusions Complementaires ' (p. 7) 'Conclusions an attempt has been made to show that the c omplementaii Sultan has been unwillingly dragged into the present case. Careful examination of the documents on which the French objections are made, which are printed on p. 40 of the British Counter-Case, will show that before the conclusion of the ' Compromis ' in October 1904, Great Britain and the Sultan were perfectly in accord as to the presentation of arguments as to French immunities in Oman, and that the letter of the 29th July, 1903, so far from being an unsuccessful attempt, embodied an accepted arrangement, while the letter of the 19th March, 1905, is merely an indication that the Sultan had not at his disposal any Agent compe tent to argue the Case at The Hague, and (to quote his own words) 'requested that His Majesty's Government would represent me and endeavour to gain my object ( £ et s'efforcer de gagner mon proces').'PUBLICATION OF UNOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. '• Conclusions jjis Majesty's Government, npon the state- ConiplemenUncs, men ^ g rna( j e this head at p. 9 of the ' Con clusions Complementaires,' have only to observe that no more has been done than to call the attention of the Tribunal to what appears to His Majesty's Government to be the irrelevancy of a great many of the French allegations and argu ments. The document of the 14th August, 1901, given to Lord Lansdowne by M. Cambon, what ever its value, is, at any rate, directly relevant to the British Case. But the discussion of general British policy in Oman appears to His Majesty's Government not to be in issue under the ' Com- promis,' and, whether the Agreement of 1862 be a diplomatic or a political document, there appears to be nothing in the ' Compromis ' which would justify an elaborate review of British policy in the Persian Gulf.4 THE SULTAN'S NOTIFICATION. The British. Argument (p. 7) has established ' Conclusions that the parties were using different texts of the ^ 01 i n P' t rne,ltiUie ' same notifications. It is common ground between the parties that the two texts speak prospectively, and the only issue between them on •the notification is whether they constitute a recog nition by the Sultan that the Suris, who had already agreed to surrender to him, or had surrendered to him their French titres, were still to be recognized as entitled to use them. The British contentions have been summarized on p. 8 of the British Argument, and are, it is submitted, not touched by any of the observations made in the 'Conclusions Complementaires.'THE SULTAN'S PROTESTS. It will be seen from the British Case that the arrest of the men who broke quarantine, which immediately led to the present ' Compromis, was made without any idea that the persons in question claimed French protection, and that it was that claim which led to the arbitration. The undated letter to (not 11 from') Colonel Mockler, on which France relies, has already been discussed in the British Argument (p. 4), and in no way justifies the interpretation put upon it. His Majesty's Government call attention to the ad mission that France has been aware since 1895,— i.e., immediately after establishing a Vice-Consul at Muscat—of the Sultan's attitude, but venture to suggest that, in view of the facts and documents set out in the British Case (p. 12 et seq.), it cannot be described as a new attitude even at that time.6 IMPORTATION INTO THE CONTROVERSY OF THE TREATY OF NOVEMBER 17, 1844. France is in error in suggesting tliat the 'Conclusions reference in the British Argument {vide pp. 5 ppTanTlT 1168 ' and 6) to the Treaty between France and Muscat of the 17th November, 1844, is in any sense a fait nouveau. That Treaty is referred to in the British Case (pp. 6, 11), and an argument is founded on rt on p. 24. In the French ' Contre-Memoire ' (p. 7) it is contended that this Treaty is res inter alios acta, and the references to the Treaty in the British Argument (p. 5) are made in response to the contentions of the French ' Contre-Memoire,' and are merely directed to establishing that it is impossible to consider adequately the matters submitted to the Tribunal without examining the terms of the Treaty. There seems also to be a misunderstanding on ' Conclusions the part of France as to the nature of the British Compl&amp;nentaires ' argument with reference to the interpretation of the Treaty of the 17th November, 1844. His Majesty's Government have distinctly recognized British Argument, that the most-favoured-nation clauses in the pp ' 5 ' 6 * Treaties of 1844 and 1891 put France and Great Britain on an equality. With respect to the persons who may claim exterritoriality, whichever Treaty gives the wider immunity establishes the measure of the privileges both of Great Britain and of I ranee. Great Britain makes no attempt to diminish the rights of France under the Treaty of 1844, and merely indicates that these rights may be extended by the most-favoured-nation clause of the Treaty of 1891.[921 FRANCISATION OF NATIVE VESSELS. •'Coucluakms His Majesty's Government protest against the Oompleineataires' matter introduced in the 'Conclusions Complementaires' under this heading. The charge advanced against the British authorities in the East Africa Protectorate is absolutely irrelevant to the question under what condition and in what circumstances francisation Jias been accorded by French Colonial authorities to native boats, and its introduction cannot be palliated by the reservation in the French ' Memoire' and ' Contre-Memoire ' of the right to supply. u indi cations complementaires ' to the Tribunal on the subject. His Majesty's Government have learned with great surprise that the French Government offer to produce to the Tribunal two licenses to fly the Zanzibar flag granted by British authorities in the East African Protectorate to natives residing at Sur. His Majesty's Government are quite unaware of the existence of any such documents, and assert that no such practice prevails in the case of any British authorities in East Africa. If the licenses in question are produced to His Majesty's Government the cir cumstances will be strictly inquired into, and if it is found that such licenses were issued by any British official under circumstances in any wa3 r similar to those under which the French Colonial authorities have granted licenses to Suris, measures will promptly be taken to mark the sense of His Majesty's Government of the im propriety of any such conduct. In the meantime His Majesty's Government are unable to accept the assertion made on p. 19 of the ' Conclusions Gomplementaires ' that such licenses have been issued, and protest against the attempt now made at the last moment to involve the Tribunal in an irrelevant inquiry of this sort. The statement made under this head is an absolutely new fact.8 RIGHTS OF POLICE AND JURISDICTION IN TERRITORIAL WATERS. The British arguments founded on Article ^p^Taire^ XLII of the Brussels Act were (1) that this p. 21. Article does not give, evea to the Powers which ratify it, any power of police in the waters of other ratifying Powers, and fully recognizes and preserves, as a rule of international law, the territorial sovereignty of these Powers, and (2) that as neither France nor Muscat was a party to the Article, France could not be justified by the Brussels Act in making the claim to police or surveillance in Muscat waters which was made !^ se ' pp. &lt; J, i o. in 1902. His Majesty's Government made no direct reference in the Argument to the Anglo-Muscat Treaty of 1873, having already dealt fully with that Treaty in the British Counter-Case (p. 33). In the Counter-Case it was necessary to deal with the contentions of the French u Memoire' (pp. 48, 56) as to the character and effect of this Treaty. His Majesty's Government see no ground for withdrawing the observations made as to the tardiness of the French objections to British Counter- this Treaty, and without entering into the technical ase, p * question of 'prescription' mentioned in the ' Conclusions Complementaires,' p. 21, submit that the fact that these objections were first put forward in this Case in 1905 affords a very strong argument against their soundness. His Majesty's Government repeat that what ever rights of search in Muscat waters Great Britain may have are conventional, and depend on the Treaties with Muscat now in force, in cluding that of 1873. France appears to have 'Conclusions , , Complementaires misunderstood the English decision m the case ^ 21. of Carr v. Fracis Times and Co., quoted on p. 34 of the British Counter-Case, and reported in the 'Law Reports (1902) Appeal Cases,' p. 176. That decision, reference to the text of which is invited, shows that the British authorities, in order to exercise the right to seize a British vessel in Muscat waters, obtained the authority of the Sultan. In view of the comments made at pp. 21-23 of the u Conclusions Complementaires' on the British Argument (p. 26), with reference to the[921] Treaty of 1844, it is perhaps desirable to indicate again the exact nature of that argument. It was directed to the opinion of M. Renault, on which France so much relies. So far as concerns the interpretation of the terms of a written document, that interpretation must be the same both for Muscat and Zanzibar. But in so far as M. Renault expressed an opinion that usage or concession had given to France in Zanzibar waters exclusive right of police over vessels under the French flag not expressly given by the Treaty, it became necessary to indicate that proof of usage or concession by the Sultan of Zanzibar since 1856 was res inter alios acta, so far as the Sultan of Muscat is concerned, and in no sense established that the Sultan of Muscat had acquiesced in any such usage, or made any such concession. And His Majesty's Government would observe, as to the statements on p. 23 of the &lt;£ Conclusions Complementaires,' that the documents already before the Court do not indicate any exercise of rights of police by France in Oman waters before 1891, and' that since that date disputes have been pending as to the matters now before the Tribunal for solution, and that there is no sign of acquiescence by the Sultan in the justice of the French claims. His Majesty's Government would also say, in conclusion, that they certainly do not accept the French contention that the arrangements between Coinullmentaires' France on the one side, and Great Britain and p. 23. Germany on the other side as to jurisdiction in Zanzibar waters, have any effect whatever in Oman.10 CAPITULATIONS AND EXTERRI TORIALITY. His Majesty's Government cannot accept the 'Conclusions theory propounded under this head of the ' Con- ^ 0 ^P , ^ rneiltaires ' elusions Complementaires,' that there is as between Christian and Mahommedan States any 'regime des Capitulations' apart from agreement. No Power has or can have any jurisdiction within the territory of another Power, except by the consent of the latter. That consent may be evidenced by formal Treaties or Capitulations or by long continued usage, but the principle is the same in both cases. Any such powers can be exercised in the very nature of things only with the consent of the Government of the country in which they are claimed. The extent of the privileges of this nature enjoyed by foreign Powers differs greatly in different countries. There is no such thing as a general usage as to a ' regime des Capitulations. The 'regime des Capitalations ' can have refer ence only to the terms which have been conceded by the Government of each particular country in which it is claimed. It is contended in the penultimate paragraph 'Conclusions of the 'Conclusions Complementaires' under this head that reference may be made to 'usages etablis ' for the purpose of ascertaining the rights of exterritoriality enjoyed by an occidental Power within the dominions of an oriental Power. This is true if it refers to the usages which have grown up in that particular country in favour of the Power claiming the immunities; but is absolutely fallacious if it is meant to refer to a general body of usages capable of application to all such countries. His Majesty's Government would also remind the Tribunal that France invokes her theory of Capitulations in order to justify protection not of Christian Europeans, but of Mussu lm an Omanis. The incident with reference to the Portuguese barque the 'Aurora,' which was engaged in canying contraband into Morocco appears to be quite irrelevant to the matters under discussion, and it amounts merely to this, that the Government of Morocco conceded to the Portuguese Govern-11 ment the same treatment of its subjects as would have been extended to the subjects of any other European nation. But it may be observed that, according to the statement of the Case on p. 26 of the 'Conclusions Complementaires,' Portugal based her claim upon consent as evidenced by usage. ' Cette reclama tion etait basee sur le regime resultant de I'en- semble des Traites passes par les Puissances avec le Maroc et dont, en fait, toutes les Puissances out le benefice.'THE ZANZIBAR SUBSIDY. There appears to be nothing under this head ' Conclusious calling for especial notice, and His Majesty 's ^ 0 ^P le,nentai Government are content to refer the Tribunal to what has already been said in the British Counter- Case, pp. 30 and 31, and to the standard work on Muscat, 'Aitchison's Treaties,' vol. xi, pp. 48, 72. Such liability to pay the subsidy as at present • devolves on Great Britain does not, except as to amount, depend on Lord Canning's Award, under ' Treaties,' vol which the Sultan of Zanzibar is the debtor, but P* ' 2 - depends on the terms on which the British Government undertook to pay the subsidy to the Sultan of Muscat, when in 1873 the Sultan of Zanzibar refused to continue it.THE SLAVE TRADE, THE COALING STATION QUESTION, OMAN GEO GRAPHY, AND THE SECRET TREATY OF 1891. There is nothing in the 'Conclusions Com- plementaires ' under these heads which calls for any further notice. oTREATY SERIES. No. 3. 1905.

PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION at the Hague. -A-W.A. IR, ID 1 OF THE TRIBUNAL OF ARBITRATION CONSTITUTED in virtue of the Comprorais signed at London on October 13, 1904 BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN and FRANCE. The Tribunal of Arbitration constituted in virtue of the Compromis concluded at London on October 13, 1904 between Great Britain and France; Whereas the Government of His Britannic Majesty and that of the French Republic have thought it right by the Declaration of March 10, 1862 a to engage reciprocally to respect the independence' of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas difficulties as to the scope of that Declaration have arisen in relation to the issue, by the French Republic, to certain subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat of papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, and also as to the nature of the privileges and immunities claimed by subjects of His Highness who are owners or masters of dhows and in possession of such papers or are members of the crew of such dhows and their families, especially as to the manner in which such privileges and immunities affect the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan over his said subjects. Whereas the two Governments have agreed by the Compromis of October 13, 1904 that these questions shall be determined by reference to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of article 1 of the Convention concluded between the two Powers on the 14 th of October 1903 ,Whereas in virtue of that Compromis were named as Arbitrators, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty: Mr. Melville W. Fuller , Chief Justice of the United States of America, and by the Government of the French Republic: Jonkheer A. F. be Savornin Lohman , Doctor of Law, former Minister of the Interior in the Netherlands, former Professor at the free University at Amsterdam, Member of the Second Chamber of the States- General, Whereas the two Arbitrators not having agreed within one month from the date of their appointment in the choice of an Umpire, and that choice having then been intrusted in virtue of article 1 of the Compromis to the King of Italy, His Majesty has named Umpire: Mr. H. Lammasch , Doctor of Law, Professor at the University at Vienna , Member of the Upper House of the Austrian Parliament, Whereas the Cases, Counter-Cases and Arguments have been duly communicated to the Tribunal and to the Parties , Whereas the Tribunal has carefully examined these documents, and the supplementary observations which were delivered to it by the two Parties; AS TO THE FIRST QUESTION: Whereas generally speaking it belongs to every Sovereign to decide to whom he will accord the right to fly his flag and to prescribe the rules governing such grants, and whereas therefore the granting of the French flag to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in itself constitutes no attack on the independence of the Sultan, Whereas nevertheless a Sovereign may be limited by treaties in the exercise of this right, and whereas the Tribunal is authorized in virtue of article 48 of the Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes of July 29, 1899 and of article 5 of the Compromis of October 13^ 1904 'to declare its competence in interpreting the compromis as well as the other treaties which may be invoked in the case, and in applying the principles of international law', and whereas therefore the question arises, under what conditions Powers which have acceded to the General Act ofthe Brussels Conference of July 2, 1890 relative to the African Slave Trade, especially to article 32 of this Act, are entitled to authorize native vessels to fly their flags, Whereas by article 32 of this Act the faculty of the Signatory Powers to grant their flag to native vessels has been limited for the purpose of suppressing sluve trading and in the general interests of humanity, irrespective of whether the applicant for the flag may belong to a state signatory of this Act or not, and whereas at any rate France is in relation to Great Britain bound to grant her flag only under the conditions prescribed by this Act, Whereas in order to attain the above mentioned purpose, the Signatory Powers of the Brussels Act have agreed in its article 32 that the authority to fly the flag of one of the Signatory Powers shall in future only be granted to such native vessels, which shall satisfy all the three following conditions: 1. Their fltters-out or owners must be either subjects of or persons protected by the Power whose flag they claim to fly, 2. They must furnish proof that they possess real estate situated in the district of the authority to whom their application is addressed, or supply a solvent security as a guarantee for any fines to which they may eventually become liable, 3. Such fitters-out or owners, as well as the captain of the vessel, must furnish proof that they enjoy a good reputation, and especially that they have never been condemned for acts of slave trade. Whereas in default of a definition of the term 'prot6g6' in the General Act of the Brussels Conference this term must be under stood in the sense which corresponds best as well to the elevated aims of the Conference and its Final Act, as to the principles of the law of nations, as they have been expressed in treaties existing at that time, in internationally recognized legislation and in international practice. Whereas the aim of the said article 32 is to admit to navigation in the seas infested by slave trade only those native vessels which are under the strictest surveillance of the Signatory Powers, a condition which can only be secured if the owners, fitters-out and crews of such vessels are exclusively subjected to the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the State, under whose flag they are sailing,Whereas since the restriction which the term 'prot^g^' underwent in virtue of the legislation of the Ottoman Porte of 1863, 1865 and 1869, especially of the Ottoman law of 23 Sefer 1280 (August 1863) implicitly accepted by the Powers who enjoy the rights of capitulations, and since the Treaty concluded between France and Morocco in 1863, to which a great number of other Powers have acceded and which received the sanction of the Convention of Madrid of July 30, 1880, the term 'prot6g6' embraces in relation to States of capitulations only the following classes 1°. persons being subjects of a country which is under the protectorate of the Power whose protection they claim, 2o. individuals corresponding to the classes enumerated in the treaties with Morocco of 1863 and 1880 and in the Ottoman law of 1863, 3°. persons, who under a special treaty have been recognized as 'prot6g6s' like those enumerated by article 4 of the French Muscat Convention of 1844 and 4°. those individuals who can establish that they had been considered and treated as 'prot6g6s' by the Power in question before the year in which the creation of new 'proteges' was regulated and limited, that is to say before the year 1863 , these individuals not having lost the status they had once legitimately acquired. Whereas that, although the Powers have expressis verbis resigned the exercise of the pretended right to create 'prot6g6s' in unlimited number only in relation to Turkey and Morocco, nevertheless the exercise of this pretended right has been abandoned also in relation to other Oriental States, analogy having always been recognized as a mean to complete the very deficient written regulations of the capitulations as far as circumstances are analogous. Whereas on the other hand the concession de facto made by Turkey, that the status of 'prot6g6s' be transmitted to the descendants of persons, who in 1863 had enjoyed the protection of a Christian Power, cannot be extended by analogy to Muscat, where the circum stances _are entirely dissimilar, the 'proteges' of the Christian Powers in Turkey being of race, nationality and religion different from their Ottoman rulers, whilst the inhabitants of Sur and other Muscat people who might apply for French flags, are in all these respects entirety in the same condition as the other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, Whereas the dispositions of article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty . of 1844 apply only to persons who are bona fide in the service of I French subjects, but not to persons who ask for ships-papers for the purpose of doing any commercial business. Whereas the fact of having granted before the ratification of the T) 1 A T r-w ™ , 'mil' Brussels Act on January 2 1892 authorizations to fly the French flag to native vessels not satisfying the 'conditions prescribed by article 32 of m m Lil li jlBrti Lithis Act was not in contradiction with any international obligation of France, FOR THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows : 1°. before the 2ad of January 1892 France was entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules; 2°. owners of dhows, who before 1892 have been authorized by France to fly the French flag, retain this authorization as long as France renews it to the grantee; 3°. after January 2, 1892 France was not entitled to authorize vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners or fitters-out had established or should establish that they had been considered and treated by France as her 'proteges' before the year 1863; AS TO THE 2ND QUESTION: Whereas the legal situation of vessels flying foreign flags and of the owners of such'vessels in the territorial waters of an Oriental State is determined by the general principles of jurisdiction, by the capitulations or other treaties and by the practice resulting therefrom. Whereas the terms of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between France and the Iman of Muscat of November 17, 1844 are, particularly in view of the language of article 3 'Nul ne pourra, sous aucun pr6texte, p6netrer dans les maisons, magasins et autres propri6t6s, possed6s ou occup^s par des Frangais ou par des personnes au service des Frangais, ni les visiter sans le consentement de I'occupant, k moins que ce ne soit avec Tintervention du Consul de France', comprehensive enough to emb race vessels as well as other pro perty. Whereas, although it cannot be denied that by admitting the right of France to grant under certain circumstances her flag to native vessels and to have these vessels exempted from visitation by the authorities of the Sultan or in his name, slave trade is facilitated, because slave traders may easily abuse the French flag for the purpose of escaping from search, the possibility of this abuse, which can be entirely- suppressed by the accession of all Powers to article 42 of the Brussels Convention, cannot affect the decision of this case, which must only rest on juridical grounds, Whereas according to the articles 31—41 of the Brussels Act thegrant of the flag to a native vessel is strictly limited to this vessel and its owner and therefore not transmissible or transferable to any other person or to any other vessel, even if belonging to the same owner, Whereas article 4 of the French-Muscat Treaty of 1844 grants to those subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat 'qui seront au service, des Frangais' the same protection as to the French themselves, but whereas the owners, masters and crews of dhows authorized to fly the French flag do not belong to that class of persons and still less do the members of their families. Whereas the withdrawal of these persons from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat would be in contradiction with the Declaration of March 10, 1862, by which France and Great Britain engaged themselves reciprocally to respect the independence of this Prince, FOR THESE REASONS, decides and pronounces as follows: 1°. dhows of Muscat authorized as aforesaid to fly the French flag are entitled in the territorial waters of Muscat to the inviolability provided by the French-Muscat Treaty of November 17, 1844; 2°. the authorization to fly the French flag cannot be ^jansmitted or transferred to any other person or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; 3°. subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, who are owners or masters of dhows authorized to fly the French flag or who are members of the crews ^ such vessels or who belong to their families, do not enjoy in consequence of that fact any right of exterritoriality, which could exempt them from the sovereignty, especially from the jurisdiction, of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.
